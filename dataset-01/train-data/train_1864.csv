4,"Meant for intermediate, expert.",Excellent visual book meant for intermediate to expert level users. May not be suitable for a beginner.
2,This album is for those who like late 80's pop,"My title says it all, it's an okay album. The lead singer is Aishah, and the band are from New Zealand. If you liek late-80's pop, you will probably like it."
4,Fair Deal,Giving the difficult finding materials in Spanish language I'm very satisfied with what I got. I received the book in just6 days. Great service! I received it in the conditions as described. Honesty! Reasonable price. Good deal for both.
4,Just As Good!!!,"Well as a native Washingtonian, I have first hand weekly experience among the Go-Go scene. I can tell you that the live experience is just as good as having the CD. Since 911 appeared into the go-go scene they have been known to put on a very good show. I have watched this band personally and I can tell that this CD (Blueprint) is as good as the live show. If you know about how Go-Go shows used to be in the past, then you would know that 911 gives you that old school flavor with fimiliar faces of past bands but a new twist. I give Blueprint four stars because I wonder if they realized that it was a little too much putting a familiar name and rap about someone who was popular back in the day.....Did you guys think some folks werent going to pick up on that. Who's next Lisa?"
4,"solid cable using for securing bicycles, kayaks, other stuff",Working great since purchased several months ago. We use primarily for securing bicycles or our kayak to the roof rack.
5,Does just what I need.,"Although the one I got was actually black everywhere and not black and yellow, I liked that better anyway. It's a good length to go through both of my bike tires, and it feels strong. It has a nice look, too."
2,"Not bad, just out of date.","I moved to the Portland area early 2001 and bought or got 3-4 books on the area. I bought this one but didn't realize this was published in 1998.Besides being out of date, I found it lacking in content compared to many of the others. It did have good info on restaraunts.Look at a few other books or citisearch for the latest and greatest."
1,Not worth the money.,"There is no way that this book could be deemed jam-packed. In fact, most of the pages are only half-filled. Each two-page ""chapter"" is based around a quote that is very loosely tied to a topic that may or may not have anything to do with busniess. If you want to get something out of your time and money, look for books by Seth Godin, Barbara Corcoran, and Tom Peters. They really entertain as well as inform their readers."
1,Too many typos. Plot is lost by Chapter 4.,"The book starts well. The scene is set nicely in the first two chapters and the authors promise you the earth. Then they seem to loose the plot. Not only do they get bogged down with too much detail and not enough overview, but lots of little mistakes seem to creep into the text. It's a pity but it seems that the book was never passed by an editor. For instance, in Chapter 4 on page 136 the authors promise to 'have a lot more to say about threading models at the end of this chapter (see the section named COM Threading Models)'. The only problem being there simply isn't a section named COM Threading Models in this or any other chapter! Furthermore, one might pardon one broken promise in one page but to do it twice is unforgiveable! Later in the same page, the authors refer to the same imaginary section!!But such mistakes and omissions are not confined to this chapter. The authors simply leave the reader bewildered and disappointed. I don't recommend it."
2,Need source code....,"This book is not very useful without its source code since the author only provides portions of the code in his book and refers the rest to the download site at wrox website. However, since acquisition of some of old wrox book by Apress the source code is not available at Apress site either. I am looking for the source code myself. If anyone has the source code I would appreciate if you could help me and email me at rdianati456@gmail.com. Thanks."
5,Most songs wonderful!,"You MUST get Crystal Lewis's song ""People Get Ready"" whether on this cd or on one of hers! I have played that song a million times and it never fails to induce a giant surge of 'happy' every time I hear it. I also love dc Talk's version of ""I Wish We'd All Been Ready."" The poignant lyrics are enhanced dramatically by their beautifully sung and haunting vocals. There's also a hard-driving song by Audio Adrenaline for the teen, and a good variety of music from other very talented artists. ""Horses"" by Margaret Becker is an upbeat song with a neat rhythm about being ready when the horses come for us! ""Eve of Destruction"" by Barry McGuire is an unusual song with unique word construction, an infectious melody, and raspy, desperate vocals that combine perfectly to declare the sadly ironic state of the world today. I am extremely pleased with this cd and highly recommend it to everyone."
4,Can't Do It Much Better Than This,People Get Ready is all songs about God's return. It does that with every angle of singing.
4,I haven't heard it yet...,"but I have the RStJ song and the dcTalk song, and they are wonderful. I'm sure the rest of the album is equally powerful!"
3,Fats Domino 50 Greatest Hits,"Missing many of the hits from mid 50's and 60's that I hoped for.If you are looking for his much older works, this would be a good choise. The quality is excellent"
5,Fats is the best.,"I was looking for an album of all of Fats Domino's songs. I have few that were a portion of his career songs but none with all of his originals. This covers the entire spectrum of his songs and they are all original, not later redues. Great album for Domino buffs."
5,After Dave King exited Fastway he formed this great band.,"Awesome hard rock album! If you are a classic Fastway fan, this is a must have! Dave King is a great singer!"
5,Extraordinary,"This book is the best ive read in years Mary Lynn Baxter has done a wonderful job. Her masterpiece is about a young girl named Beth Melbourne whose life was shattered at the tender age of 18. Following that heartbreaking incident she fled her hometown Shawnee,Louisiana in search hope to fill her wounds. I hope whoever reads this review reads this wonderful book today you wont regret it."
5,"Beautifully written, wonderful, touching","I discovered Mary Lynn Baxter's books last year and I have to tell you that I have not been disappointed yet. I happened to be in the store a few days ago and saw this book and I got it because it sounded interesting. Then I went away for the week-end and I took it along and I was hoping I would get a few minutes to read it. I picked it up Saturday night and could not put it down. It was so great, I cried almost through the whole book. It was so tragic, so touching that I could not believe that I would be so moved by this book. I did not want to put it down, it was so wonderful....This is one book that I will read over and over again and have plenty of hankies while I am reading it."
2,A three minute conversation would have solved everything...,"I really, really hate books based entirely on the premise of misunderstandings, and I think maybe this book is the worse offender I have yet to encounter. Less than three minutes of conversation would have cleared up the entire mess of rapes and kids born out of wedlock. Why would you want to be with someone that you absolutely cannot tell the truth to, all under the guise of it ""being for their own good?"" This makes for such a frustrating and contrived plot.In addition, there was no real explanation for why the brother failed to come forward with what he had seen, other than he resented his sister because Daddy loved her best? I don't like stories that can only happen in LaLa land.Also, the writing was really bad and the dialog was completely unbelievable.I wish someone would have written a more honest review of this book before I spent my money."
4,Temporary relief,"This item is a good thing for you hunters using tree stands and especially climbing tree stands. This can attache your stand to the tree during those breaks in hunting taken for lunch, mid-day break or whatever. The best thing it does is relieve you of the thought that someone may take your tree stand while you are taking a break. It removes the ""window of opportunity"" which may happen if a unethical hunter happens along and sees your stand. Your stand locked to the tree removes any ""instant window of opportunity"" for theft which may happen. It's a good item to have, and easy to carry and use."
5,An excellent translation,A beautiful and accessible translation. The notes in the back are an added bonus.
1,Missing Pages,"The Homeric Hymns: A Translation, with Introduction and Notes (Joan Palevsky Classic Literature Book)The book came with 9 missing pages."
3,Great series but not so great writing,"The Horus Heresy series is a fantastic idea and I love it. Dan Abnett's opener was amazing, especially in the way he conjured such an epic tone for the events. Unfortunately, Mcneil's characters are less real and less solid. His sense of the events of the HH must be second to none, but he is simply not the writer that Abnett is ... In some ways, he's the opposite of the more interesting BL writers (who depart from the so-called 'facts' at times); McNeil sticks to the facts too rigidly and this occasionally makes his writing dull.Facts are not all that they're cracked up to be.Having said all of that, if you're interested in the Heresy, then you must read this book."
4,I was there the day Horus Fell,"Good middle book. I like how the minor rivalries for glory amongst the Primarchs and the Astartes soldiers have finally been blown to near conflict. These two books have really built several characters and to feel sad in a good way when two B characters get bumped off at the end in such cold ways is really a high complement to both Abnett and McNeil. I have the next segment on my night stand and highly anticipate Horus in open betrayal and am dreading to see whether Loken can survive as well as not end up corrupted. How do you escape from a war fleet thaat is pusing at the borders of known space? I want Loken to survive, to get back to the Emperor to warn him but somehow he has to stay within a fleet and survive a bunch of slowly going mad armed men who have decided he is a problem."
5,What can I say?,"I have a theory about books, and it goes like this: If a book contains guns, swords, spaceships, robots, or aliens then it is going to be a pretty good book. If the book contains all five of those things then it is possibly THE GREATEST STORY OF ALL TIME!!! (read that last part with an echo effect on the voice in your head)I like the Wahammer 40k series. They are good, fun reads. That is all they promise to be, and they deliver every time."
4,Good Sci-Fi,"You don't have to be a DoW gamer to enjoy these books. As a fan of good science fiction (Robert Heinlein & Issac Asimov, sp?), I've been pleasantly suprised at how much I've enjoyed reading ""The Horus Heresy"" series. I've read the first two and have just ordered the next three. These books tell of the actions, adventures; the loyalty and betrayal of those who fight for the Imperium of Man. The dark plots have twists & turns, some dry humor, and interesting decriptions of other worlds both natural and well, not so natural."
3,More than DDS,"This book has a lot of real world examples, but they are all from pre 1999, so they are mostly out of date. The references to academic work is extensive. This is a good introduction, but you will have a lot more reading beyond this book to come up to date on the subject."
1,Terrible!,I have yet to recieve my order! will never order again from this user. Its been over a month since I ordered this.
4,Many details -- this may not be right for your kids,"This book goes into rather more detail about O'Keeffe's and Steiglitz's relationship than I am comfortable giving to a grade schooler, but the book is a good biography and includes MANY color photographs of O'Keeffe's work.I'm a bit troubled that the name of the series is ""Portraits of Women Artists For Children"" and a main theme of the book seems to be ""Sleep with a famous male artist and you'll be successful."" Maybe that's just me.A better choice for children, although much easier, is ""Georgia O'Keeffe"" by Ray Spangenburg."
3,looks lnice when finished,"I liked the finished look, but very time consuming to put together and when it has you glue things on, not sure how long this stocking will last us."
4,My previous experience has to do with sewing a loose button.,It is A LOT OF WORK. You have to be committed. Instructions are clear. Leave the name for the end. You'll gain enough experience after you finish with santa...then work on the name. Little stars are a pain! Don't throw away extra yellow felt. You may have to go back and make extra stars.
3,Good Biography,"Overall, I would recommend this book to read because of all the books out there, it probably gives us the closest description of who Selena was as a person in contrast of who she was as a singer and entertainer. Although, I would caution not to take every detail in the book as factual since some of the information in the book could be considered heresay and I am not entirely convinced about the validity of some of the sources used."
3,A life cut too short,"Selena life's was an amazing journey over obstacles and pressures, both from within and without. Yet she persevered and that is what makes her life so interesting. Patoski conveys some of that struggle here, as well as the culture backdrop. We learn her life was cut too short, her influence spreading far beyond her hometown, as detailed in the fine ""The Billboard Guide to Tejano and regional Mexican Music,"" on Billboard Books. As Ramiro Burr wrote, Selena will be remembered as an American cult hero, much like Marilyn Monroe or James Dean."
2,An exploitation of Selena,"I am truly embarrassed and sorry that I purchased this book. This book gives a detailed account of Selena's life. Unfortunately, it seems to be based on rumors, not necessarily all facts. It does give lots of details, but it jumps around a lot and is kind of difficult to follow. Also, since Selena's family did not authorize this book, it is hard to believe this book word for word. The worst part is the author goes into great detail about how upset Selena's father Abraham Quintanilla is about people just trying to make money off of his daughter's death by selling unauthorized t-shirts, posters (including ones of Selena in her casket), tapes, and books, yet the author fails to admit that he himself is doing the same thing. I regret buying this book and contributing to this author's income."
2,disapointed,I thought it was the complete set when I purchase it but if you have the frame now for it let me know cos i can't used that tarp with out the frame but is most all my fault by not paying attention to the web pagebut if i would it know that it was just the replacement tarp my local store has it for 40 dollars less
3,doesn't fit motoshade frame,good quality but it doesn't fit the 10 x 20 motoshade frame. i had to improvise to get it on.
2,Shelter top replacement,"The replacement on arrived on time. The quality appears to be good. However, when ordering this item from other vendors in the past they always came with bungee cord tie downs to secure the top. This company sends the top with nothing. I had to go find another vendor to purchase the tie downs, then they didn't fit well. This additional purchase didn't make this a good deal. Last time to buy from Shelter Logic. I will go back to my original vendor."
1,This replacement tarp does not fit,"This replacement tarp won't fit your frame, if it's not a Shelter Logic frame. It is cut too small. Plus, and this is what I hated most, it does not have any grommets on the ends. The ends of the tarp are held in place only by the drawstring over the frame. Assuming you can get it over the ends of the frame, as it is also too short.Unless you have exactly this frame, from this company, don't buy this tarp!"
2,Firestorm,"The heroine, Reyne, seemed to be a bit childish and silly, and the author's excuse for that was that she had watched some of her fire crew die. The hero is a bit arrogant and seems to think he's just too charming for anyone. Also, the relationship advances way too quickly. I don't really think it was all that bad, but just not my type of book."
4,Love the plot and characters in this book.,"Firestorm is the story of Reyne Oldre. She suffers guilt and fear because of an accident involving fire and doesn't want to be involved with it again. However, when she is forced to work with Logan on a research project working to make firefighting safer for smoke jumpers, she finds herself being pulled back into that world.I thought the author did a great job at creating compelling and realistic scenarios with the firefighting, and I especially enjoyed that aspect because my husband has done some work on fire crews, although he's never been a smoke jumper.Firestorm is the 6th book in the series, and while there were certainly times I wished I'd read the previous ones, this book is a stand alone novel and can be enjoyed even if you haven't read the others."
1,Not My Speed,I guess if you are religous this book is okay. Otherwise it is incredibly boring and tedious. If your not a bible thumper bypass this book.
3,Very good for the money,I found this small vauum very effective in cleaning both carpet and tile flooring. The no assembly feature is great. I have only used it a few times but it has performed very well.I am providing it in a furnished rental property. It has a self propelled feel when on carpet due to the brush feature. The bagless filtering system may work too well and become clogged quickly. I feel that the lower rating may well be a function of the paper element clogging. This is not a Dyson I bought it at Walmart for 40 dollars and feel it would be a good buy at 60-70 dollars but not any higher. I don't expect it too last much longer than a year but feel that is fine considering the price. It is replacing a much more expensive vacuum that performed less well.
4,Great for the price !,"Just bought this at a Black Friday sale. Was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked ! Picked up pet hair, crumbs etc - I was amazed to see how much was on my carpets after only a few days since I last vacuumed with my old Dirt Devil. Only complaint would be that the hose easily slips off where you attach attachments - you need to make sure you really get it on there good."
4,Love it!,I have had this vacuum for 3 years. I have never had any problems with it. The suction is great. It's pretty light weight too. I especially love the fold away handle. It is perfect for space saving and small apartments! And you still get all your basic on board attachments. I look forward to having this vacuum for many years to come!
5,Excellent information,"The truth behind the weakening of American rights explained in context to the entire world.The Founding Fathers had it correct, but we have let the wrong people take control of the government and sway many laws away from being neutral guidelines, to behavior modification and oppression tools."
3,Solid and Professional,"With the exception of Daybreak in Dixie and Big Country I would not describe this CD as driving bluegrass. I would describe it as tastefull and clean. If you are looking for a hard driving type of CD this may not be the one for you. If you are looking for an extremely professional project with clean picking and some very good mid-tempo tunes, this ones for you. With many high quality pickers including Ron Stewart, Tim Stafford, Barry Bales, Marc Pruett and Randy Kohrs the chops are here. But they are kept to something less than a frenzy.If you are a fan of Adam Steffey you will enjoy this. If your tastes lean towards the group Mountain Heart, which he is now in, or up-tempo songs, you may want to give this a second thought.3 stars for a solid project."
5,Grateful,"I never did know who Adam Steffey was until I went to hear him play with Dan Tyminski one night a couple of years ago. After that night, I have bought many copies of his albums and love listening to his excellent talent on the mandolin. He has won many International Bluegrass Music Awards for his talent. This album contains many songs that you will enjoy!!"
2,Extremely low security,"Warded locks (including this one) can be picked in less than 2 seconds by a complete amateur with a paper clip. Locking something just draws attention to it as a target; since this lock offers nearly zero security, you might as well not use a lock."
3,Here's hoping!,"I don't yet know if this does any good. I've only been using it for a few days, but it did come quickly, and looks just like the picture...that's about it for now."
5,A treasure of Sufi wisdom- and a treasure of wisdom,This book contains some of the finest poetry from the literature of sufism; It is an awesome gift to the world; The photographs have something that reminds me of the young Ansel Addams;The best book on sufism i've read in years!
4,Air conditioner cover,"The cover is a good cover the only thing I did not care for was the way to tie the the draw rope it should of had some kind of latch to join the two rope ends instead of trying to tie the rope ends. I have seen this type on beach bags,"
4,Great toy for Toddlers,My 2 year old loves this toy. It's helped her climbing skills as well as given her the courage to go down the slide. She loves to play peekaboo at the window of the clubhouse and crawl through the tunnel. My only criticism is that the climber gathers water when it rains and cannot drain. Very sturdy. Overall a great toy and highly recommended.
4,Great Product,"I would give this 5 stars if it weren't for the expensive price tag. Wouldn't be so bad if free or reduced cost shipping was available. 25% of item cost is shipping. Otherwise, great product especially for children under 3 that are not quite ready for the big slides or swings but are out of the ""baby"" stage and are walking. This in combination with a swing set should keep the little ones occupied for for several years. My 18 month old loves it and the crawl space underneath is a great place for peak-a-boo! The only other complaint I have is that the ""chairs"" are a hazard and should be made to be bolted to the floor. These slide out from under her when she attempts to sit on them and they are made to go with the table which is a foot from the slide opening, so as you can imagine your child trying to climb or sit on the ""chair"" and it slides out from under them or tips over and they tumble down the slide. (didn't happen to my child because I took them out before it could)."
4,Good Climber...with a few issues,"My husband and I bought this climber for out 23 month old son. Step 2 claims this climber is for ages 2-8 but I think 2-5 is probably the maximum. My son is small to average for his age and it fits him perfectly at his current size. He likes playing in it except when it gets wet and water pools in the steps up to the clubhouse. Since this is the only way onto the climber, without climbing up the slide, he doesn't like to use it when this happens.It was very easy to put together so I really like that. If we can get a few years out of it and sell it for half what we paid I think it will be a very good investment. We have a long narrow yard, so this was a great option for us instead of a large swingset. Fits well and there is still pleanty of room for other fun outdoor toys."
4,Very Pleased,Very happy with this toy we bought for my son. He enjoys playing on it whenever we're outside. Not challenging to build and light enough for 2 people to move it.
5,Just what we wanted (needed),"Our 1 year old is a climber and we needed something for him to play on so we can have a break. He loves it and it's just the right size for him. Instead of going up the ladder and down the slide, he likes to go up the slide and slide down the ladder. They designed the ladder so that if some kid thinks it is a slide it is still safe. I read one review about the ladder getting filled with water after it rains. That is true, but I solved that by drilling 1/4"" weep holes in the footholes, and then drilling some at the bottom so that the water goes into the plastic ladder and then weeps out the holes in the bottom. When our son wants a few seconds of quiet time, he goes and hides in the tunnel. It's great."
4,Great for the inflexible,"I bought this product, over a month ago, after reading some of the reviews on here. When I first got the product and took it out of the box, I sat on it to see if it was as comfortable as the people that reviewed it stated. I didn't find it too comfortable, in the beginning and used it, ""as is"", for two days, to meditate on it. I got use to it, but still didn't find it comfortable, until I remembered from some of the reviews, that you can take out some of the filling to adjust the comfort level/fit. I took out some of the filling and placed it into a big freezer lock bag to keep for future use (not in the freezer lol). It was amazing how just removing some of the filling, made this item soo comfortable. I love it and meditate on it, two to three times a day, and forget that I am sitting on it, in meditation. This is key, because I have tight thighs and am inflexible in certain ways, that make it difficult for me to meditate in cross legged position. I recommend it, highly."
5,Works as Advertised,"The Hugger Mugger Zafu is a well constructed providing a firm and stable seat for your meditation or yogic practice. The buck wheat filling can be adjusted for a customized fit to match your comfort level. It is an excellent choice for portable or additional seating. The sturdy handle makes it convenient while traveling and the canvas cover cleans easily. I have been extremely pleased with the utility, durability, and pleasing appearance of this Zafu and recommend highly."
5,I take refuge in the cushion,"I've been very pleased with this zafu (which I ended up choosing, because it was the cheapest one I could find, which looked comparable to the $40-60 cushions available elsewhere). The material is a heavy, soft cotton, it's stitched well, comes generously stuffed and there is a zipper on the side so you can adjust the heighth by removing some of the filling.I feel very stable and grounded on this cushion. I'd been sitting on flat ground for two years, before finally breaking down and buying a zafu, that I almost feel spoiled with this. It's made meditation much more enjoyable for me. I can sit much longer than I could on flatground and without any discomfort."
3,Very large and very heavy zafu,"We bought this zafu to replace one that the cat besmirched. The old one was well-stuffed with a soft natural filling and was the perfect diameter for an adult to sit on. This one is stuffed with an EXTREMELY heavy buckwheat filling - it weighs a ton and certainly could not comfortably be carried around. It is also very large in diameter - probably about half again bigger than our previous zafu (which was recommended to us by the local Zen center). Sitting on this is like sitting on a beanbag chair. Plus, the filling makes noise when it shifts. All in all, it works okay, but we cannot really recommend it for any kind of sitting meditation, especially if you need to move it from room to room, or take it somewhere. However, for TV watching it would probably be just the thing to lean on."
4,yes i,this zafu is good for sitting in hero pose (virasana) but it is a bit too high for most people to sit in full or half lotus (padmasana) on it.
5,great!,"Beautiful color, well made and much firmer than I was expecting. This fact, however, is the reason I like it so much. I feel held, supported, and overall, well taken care of when meditating on this fabulous cushion."
2,Too high and heavy,"I got this Zafu(meditation cushion.) It is round in shape and too high and bulky to be comfortable to sit on, around 9 inches high and 15-18 inches in diameter. It is also pretty heavy, around 4 pounds due to the sheer size.I could not sit comfortably on it due to this reason returned it. I would recommend trying it somewhere before buying.The filling seemed of good quality."
4,A Cushion To Meditate On,This is the first time I've used a meditation cushion and this one works really well for me. I can comfortably sit for long periods which was hard for me to do without it. It is nicely made and is everything I expected.
3,Yoga Cushion,"This is a very nice cushion, but it is much, much smaller in diameter than appears. If you have a ""booty"" you may need something bigger!"
4,love it,"i love it. it is comfy, easy to carry around and a nice color. the only thing is that some of the stitching is coming loose on the handle. otherwise it is great."
5,Meditate Like a Warrior,This little cushion is fantastic for meditation. I would highly recommend the buckwheat filled as it forms to your body and also creates a lot of needed support for sitting straight and tall. The material is high quality and I doubt that even my dog could really pull the thing apart. I got the plum and it's a nice color that blends well with most atmospheres. A great product for the price. You can meditate like a warrior on this little seat!
5,Music,I love to listen to all of music by the Gaither groups. They get you in the mood to receive the Holy Spirit. You need to listen to all their music.
5,great cd!,VERY GOOD CD. YOU WANNA BUY ONE BUY THIS ONE FIRST. MAKES ME WANNA SIT DOWN AND PRAISE THE LORD. I'D RATE IT 100 STARS IF I COULD! BUY IT!
3,"Not bad, but there are better Central American cichlid books","Contains some useful information, but TFH's ""Cichlids From Central America"" book, by Ad Konings, is MUCH better."
2,Misleading,"The best part of this book is the pictures. As with many TFH books the promise exceeds the delivery. There is very little information of use to the hobbiest included in this work. So basic a fact as the size the fish reach is missing. Many of the fish shown are never or very rarely available to the hobbiest. Years ago TFH published a book, I beileve the title was ""The Fishes of Lake Karibi"". This book had nothing to do with the aquarium hobby, but rather was a study of the commercial fishery on this lake. A hobby publisher should publish hobby books and leave text and science books to someone else. Or publish them under another name."
5,It's white. It's paper. It's legal sized.,"Can't complain, really. We needed some bright-white paper for some programs we were printing. This paper fit the bill perfectly. 28lb weight was pretty standard, so this isn't card stock by any means.It does fold/crease pretty easily, so be careful if you're using this for anything where people may be picky about that sort of thing."
5,Awesome Bike Lock,"Found a 24"" chain out in the desert 8 months ago, retrieved a few weeks ago and it was still unrusted. This lock fit perfectly with it and now it's a third bike lock! May God be blessed!"
3,This is for Canadians,"When I first saw this book I thought it would be a good read for my parents, but good thing I did more research on it and realized this book is strictly for Canadian citizens. I really have no comment. I just wish there were a similar book for us Americans."
1,This applies only to Canada,"I belong to a partnership with one employee. We're embroiled in confusion and arguments about our pension obligations to our employee. I thought this book would answer our problems. Maybe it would, if we lived in Canada. Unfortunately, the Amazon description of the book does not mention this tiny little detail."
4,Starts Off Slow,"This album may start off slow (the first half is mostly filled with relatively 'meh' pop songs that aren't terrible, but aren't anything special either), but the second half saves the album. It's filled with crunching power chords and Mott the Hoople and Kinks inspired pop songs (in fact, they pay homage to Mott the Hoople by recording a killer cover of All the Way to Memphis). This is a fun album of crunchy, punky rock songs, and it is a great indie album (from before indie was the 'in' thing). I recommend this album, but I'd make a suggestion to check out Supercluster: The Big Dipper Anthology first because it has a much wider assortment of songs to choose from."
5,A travel guide to find love without addictions,"Brenda Schaeffer's book is very personal since it reveals not only true case history but also candidly share a practicing therapist reflections. She reveals to her readers how love is available to all and to understand what it really is in the union of the body, ego, soul and spirit.It is a small book packed full of common sense advices and spirit awakening exercises that are just gems! Her creativity and fresh approach to therapy offers rituals and life affirming recipes to design your own love life, to overcome the bad hand that was dealt, to give each one of us winning cards and the will to discard the jokers in the deck.I will always keep this book as a travel guide to navigate the rest of my life’s journey. Let's hope that Mrs. Schaeffer will soon offer a companion workbook to allow her readers and students to chart their progress."
3,Brief but good,"This short book is an excellent introduction to the main personalities and chronology of the Reformation. The coverage of Martin Luther is brief, but the section on John Calvin and the role of Calvinism to the broader Reformation is quite good. Overall, the book does a good job of covering the Reformation in England. Specifically, Mosse nicely reveals the interplay between religion and politics that resulted in the theological ambiguity of Anglicanism. For a more detailed alternative, you might consider readingThe Reformation (Hist of the Church)by Owen Chadwick."
4,"Amazing similarity to Dean Koontz 's ""Sole Survivor""","I really enjoyed this book. The opening chapter describing the plane crash was breathtaking. I wouldn't take too much notice of the supernatural aspect of Amanda's powers - they are not the main story line.Mind you I just saw a telemovie called Sole Survivor based on a Dean Koontz novel and the similarities between the 2 stories is amazing. The similarities are enough to make you believe in the supernatural :) Both feature plane crashes with sole survivor, a child that can heal the sick, a sad lonely guy that helps save teh girl, bad guys chasing them. One of them must have left a draft on the train and the other picked it up."
2,like a violent action movie,"Andrew Klavan's ""Hunting Down Amanda"" is a thriller with sci-fi overtones, involving the heavy use of heavy weapons. Although the protagonists are wounded souls who are well drawn, the plot reads too much like a screenplay for an action movie. The bad guys are all bad, and there is no redemption for them. As in Klavan's most recent book, ""Man and Wife"", a character becomes almost a Christlife figure, giving up his own life for another.As the plot unfolded, I began to hope that Amanda would use her special gifts to heal the bad guys, to change them into loving and life-affirming characters. That would be the greater miracle, and a more ingenious plot twist than those Klavan has concocted!"
2,Seems hurried.,"Picked this up because the title caught my eye. Although it was somewhat entertaining and certainly a quick read, I find it hard to recommend this book. The character development is poor and left me wondering why in the world someone like Lonnie Blake would ever be interested in a Carol Dodson. Or why a man who has just taken over the American branch of a ""killer for hire"" corporation would become so obsessed with Dodson. Or why it's necessary to kill everyone in the path of finding Carol, as if this wouldn't attract some sort of attention.Combine that with the ""made for TV movie"" style writing and you get a book that wasn't as satisfying at all. At one point he describes a background character as a ""doofus"" and I began to wonder how old the person who wrote this was. All in all, the book seemed rushed to publication, as if the author had no time to think and write the story out the way he wanted.Sorry Mr Klavan, but this one needed a lot of work."
4,very well done!,"A very well done thriller by a very talented writer. Good plot. Flawed, but interesting characters. Hints scattered here and there, but not so many that you could guess what was going to happen next. And a totally unexpected, but totally fulfilling surprise ending. Well worth reading IMHO."
4,Page Turning Suspense,"This book was enjoyable from beginning to end. Using the key ingredient of suspense, Klavan keeps you on the edge of your seat. The characters are creative and true to their own nature; Lonnie as the main character is interesting all the way.Some of the other reviews touched on the more ""supernatural"" part of the novel. Don't let them scare you. After all, fiction was meant to be FICTION - read it and enjoy."
3,Reads Like a Movie Script,Starts off and continues with lots of potential until he begins writing the last 75 pages -- then I felt like I was reading a movie script with impossible car crashes and lucky gun shots for all the right people. And Amanda's condition is never really focused on -- just some vague reference to her healing abilities. Would have been better if the time was taken to explore it.
2,Adequate at best!,Seemed too long and way too trite for me. An okay summer beach read but I too felt as if it was just missing something- a well thought out plot???
3,Intriguing plot,I ran across this in a ship's library near the end of the voyage so could not finish it. Bought a cheap copy and found the quality of the writing and the plot twists very enjoyable.
1,impressively awful,"The premise at the heart of this book is unbelievable, the characters are lifeless, and the plot is ridiculous. Having been disappointed by others of Klavan's novels, I'm beginning to wonder if someone else wrote True Crime."
1,B A D,"SHORT: A frustrating and unrecommended read. All of the elements of a second-rate action movie are here, from the high body count to the transparent plot. Save yourself the time and wait for the made-for-TV movie.LONG: Where to begin describing this terrible book...pretty much every part of it is bad. I felt like I was reading a B-movie script.The characters are one-dimensional and cliched. There's the evil bounty hunter hell-bent on getting his target. The trashy but heroic single mom. The innocent little girl with mystical powers (Amanda). The bad guy who sacrifices himself to 'do the right thing'. The bumbling henchmen. Even these pale in comparison to the racial stereotypes portrayed by the old Jewish professor and the black jazz musician.....A frustrating and unrecommended read. All of the elements of a second-rate action movie are here, from the high body count to the transparent plot. Save yourself the time and wait for the made-for-TV movie."
2,Not as exciting or compelling as I thought it would be.,"I was really excited for a fast paced beach read. The beginning is excellent and really gets you involved but I found myself less and less interested in the plot as it unfolded. I didn't like the main character (Lonnie), and I just couldn't root for him. The villian is so evil you know the whole time he's going to die an awful, dramatic death. I was disappointed."
2,Nothing exciting,"I was expecting this book to be a definate page turner with the main character falling for a prostitute who is on the run. The opening of the book is brilliant - a little girl (Amanda) is caught in a strange storm and goes off into the woods. The rest of the book is about Lonnie Blake, a musician, who helps out a prositute (Carol Dodson) one night and eventually falls for her. But Carol is hiding her daughter, Amanda, from many people, for reasons that are apparent throughout the story and Lonnie helps out both of them.I was disappointed with this book, it was hardly exciting plus by the end of it I really didn't care what happened to any of the characters, I pushed myself to finish it, but the ending was no surprise.Not recommended if you are after an excellent thriller, bypass this one and head on over to anything by Dennis Lehane or Michael Connelly."
1,TOO SMALL!!!!!!!!!!,"This must be for an infant, not a toddler. I clearly didn't read the reviews before purchasing. My son is 19 months old...and this was TOO SMALL. Now I realize that my son's head is a bit larger than most, but this should have fit if it is meant to be used for toddlers.Do not buy - it is a waste of $. I also agree with the other reviewer - horribly scratchy. I picked up a much better one - softer, larger, etc. at a local pharmacy for half the price."
3,Served its purpose,"Runs a small - fit my 6 month old perfectly. It lasted the day for a photo shoot, so it served its purpose. I don't think it will last for long periods of time because the fuzzy material started to come off."
3,Not really for 6+ yr olds,Yes my son has a big head for his age but he's two and this says its for 6+. It works for a picture but I won't fit most kids over 3.
3,Great if you have a 3d Graphics Card,My Son had anticipated this arrival of this game for weeks. His anticipation faded to frustration as we tried to load the game.I have an older Win 95 PC with lots of memory and Ram. THIS GAME REQUIRES A 3D GRAPHICS CARD. This is not mentioned anywhere except inside the instruction manual. The software mode which is reccomended is very slow and the motion is very jerky. If you want this game make sure you have a 3D graphisc card. We will wait to get the Play station 2 version of this game.
2,Waste of money,"My 5 year old finds this game extremely frustrating. It takes forever to load a saved game, the graphics are cheesy, and it's hard to maneuver Jimmy around. Surely they could have come up with something better than this."
2,OK GAME,THE GAME ISN'T REALLY GOOD.BUT MY BROTHER AND SISTER LIKES IT ALOT WHEN I WAS READING A BOOK THEY WERE SCREAMING LOUDLY CUZ THEY WERE BEING CHASED BY A CAR IN AREA 51 (YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO AVOID THE CARS) BUT IT ISN'T FUN BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE SHOUDN'T BE INTERESTED IN THIS GAME.AND THE REASONS THAT I DON'T LIKE IT CUZ IT'S VVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY EASY TO BEAT NICK ON THE SKATE BOARD VS GODARD SCOOTER RACE AND THE ALEINS ARE REALLY DUMB CUZ WHEN IT SEES YOU THEY SET OFF THE ALRAM AND WHEN YOU ACIVE THE INVISIBLE MODE THE ALRAM IS NO MORE RINGING. WEIRD... HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL!
4,Showing,"Reminiscent of de Sade, this novel is written in a kind of telling-not-showing style, very unlike modern novels. However, the concepts and imagery within are fascinating, especially some of the more disturbing sexual acts. The novel--more of a novella in terms of size--is a bit ridiculous at times, but overall a curious and interesting read. Good for those bored with current erotica or in need of something to shock friends with."
4,So different and interesting read,"This is the strangest book I have ever read. But I am learning now as a grown women that not every thing in a is about Monsters or happy endings. This is a dark and disturbing book that is very thought prevoking. I feel as though I am reading a secret diary and I love it. Makes me look at me and how society views sexuality. Yes, the main charactors are a little crazy but it is a erotic fantasy many of us would like to visit if only for an afternoon. PS What's up with the eggs???"
2,Fever Induced Delerium,"I did not get it. Bored me to death.I know it has an intellectual commentary by Susan Sontag, et al. And is published by Penguin classics. But I just did not get it.If this had been handed to me in plain wraps I would have thought the author a thirteen-year-old boy; it has that isn't sex shocking mentality. Perhaps it was enough to excite back in the day when piano legs needed covers. I can only imagine this now being of interest to students of English Literature.I've read all the other reviews and the commentaries, and now understand what the author was trying to do, but its still pretty awful.I admit it was haunting and dream like in places. Thinking about it: that's what it reminds me of, a night of fever induced delirium.But it moved me about as much as listening to old Edwardian songs. ""Come Into the Garden Maud"" certainly won't get me into the Moshpit.Enough said."
4,Interesting & Intriguing,"This book is so small that it is definitely an easy one night treat for a seasoned reader. I enjoyed it and found it completely interesting and definitely before it's time. I had to keep reminding myself when it was written! It was sometimes hard to understand the language and context, but the further you read along, the more clear it became. There were a couple of pretty disturbing chapters and is not for the faint of heart. I am a die-hard Stephen King fan and found it delicious. It definitely has lots of shock value! ENJOY!!"
5,"i'm young, dumb, and hung","inspirational piece of erotic fiction that makes better sinners out of all of us. its better not to know too much, but just dive right in. it's bataille vs. sexuality in all forms, religious, violent, depraved. i've bought this book like four times actually because i keep giving it to people and they never give it back."
4,consider,"""Bataille denudes himself, exposes himself, his exhibitionism aims at destroying all literature.. . In him, reality is conflict.""--Jean-Paul SartreYes. That is on the back of the book. Well, the back of the one most of us these days probably read. So, why is it that nearly every comment on this site has given THE EYE literary treatment? Is it that they do not agree with Jean-Paul Sartre? Well, if that's the case, they'd better go read his books first. And what about those who've already read Sartre's books? Well, then they already know. Know what? Well, that this is not literature. Or rather, this is literature aimed to bring to mind the falsehoods of other literature. Bataille is mocking the 'upright man' of Hugo's works, of all literature, because that's not REAL. Bataille belongs to the class of Sartre. THE EYE is a view of human nature likened to when one opens a book (as one looks into a soul), he reads. . . and finds NOTHING."
2,Story wasn't worth price of book,"If you're into Marquis de Sade type shock value, this book is up your alley. It's a little confusing, and not at all erotic, well, I wasn't turned on by it...it was worth reading, but not for that price. It was only 100 pages and there's more books continuing the storyline, so it kinda leaves you hanging..."
1,How can anyone like this book?,"This book has no artistic value whatsoever. You may as well buy a porn magazine. Even if you can get past all the disgusting sexual details, there is no substance to the story. It's extremely disturbing and twisted. I felt guilty just reading it. Don't buy this book if you have a weak stomach or if you like the books you read to have a plot or some kind of meaning."
1,Pointless to say the least,"My first major problem with this book is the plot; yea, there isn't one. Yes it contains a lot of lewd porn, but that might not have been so bad had there actually been a storyline to this novel. There was no character development (except for the minor character development concerning the character of Marcelle) and a lack of character analysis. My second problem with this book is the revolting scences. Pissing on others is not something most people find erotic and neither are many of the other scences. The author seems childish, immmature and very underdeveloped. Of course there is also the possiblity that I just dont understand what he is trying to prove or say."
5,Classic pornographic French literature,"After knocking out most of Bataille's philosophy, I decided to give his fiction a chance. To my surprise I really liked this book, but however buyer beware, if you are offended by graphic sexual imagery this isn't the book for you. It features sex acts envloving eggs, orgies, and various debauched sex acts in a Catholic church included the murder of a priest. Published in the mid 20's it's still graphic even today. In the vain of de Sade or Jean Genet. I recommend this book for fans of either."
2,Sordid and depressing,"I thought this book was well written and engrossing, but I could not relate to the characters at all. The parents, Joseph and Celice seemed more like 70 year olds than in their mid 50's. They seemed half dead (both physically and mentally) before the murder! Maybe that is why the book was named ""Being Dead"". The sordidly scientific descriptions of their physical demise was fitting for their characters. They were not likable. They were self absorbed, boring, dull, drab, sloppy, and totally un-inspiring. They were terrible parents. And as a result their daughter Syl came across as a sad, troubled, deplorable child. She was selfish, inconsiderate, and crude. A pathetic narrative."
1,Dreary Macabre Tale.,"A dreary tale about dull people. The author is a gifted writer, he just wasted his talents is this lengthy dissertation on the minute details of the decompostion of the human body. I thought this was a mystery novel. It was not. This book did not end, it just stopped."
2,Started with a bang; ended with a dud.,"This was interesting as to the perspective of death and decay by insects, grass, etc. It started to get uninteresting and reminded me of those high school classics that are so dry and full of symbolism that you forget about the sheer joy of reading for reading sake. I would not reccomend this to anyone."
1,Should have put it down sooner,I found the characters dull. The writing effusive and the story boring. I should have put it down when it started examining the death scene from the dung beetle's perspective.
4,Long live the Sprayhoppers...,"Somewhat morbid, but that is the perplexity of such great writing. I found that I was more enthralled with Crace's description of how the characters ""felt"" in a sense after their murder, more so than by the actual characters themselves. This book portrays a haunting love story, unfortunately, after death."
2,OK.. just,"I found this book to be a difficult read. It is well-written but the message is rather bleak. OK, here are some people whose bodies are decaying and becoming a part of the earth. But, every character in the book - without exception - is very selfish, judgemental. Their lives are unfulfilled and wanting. The message seems to be that life is horrible and then you die, and your body decays. Even death itself, as described by Crace, appears to have no mystical aspect, it's like: ""now i'm alive... now i'm not"". Don't read it if you're looking for something uplifting."
2,Major Disappointment,"Nothing about this really worked for me. I can't recommend that anyone spend the time reading this book, even though it is short. I was trapped on a airplane and still almost put it down for good. I didn't get this book by accident; this is the type of think I read. This book is more of a gesture or exercise by Crace. Extremely disappointing given the critical hype."
3,"Okay, but not devastating","Well-wraught, fine descriptions of scenery and (physical attributes of) characters. However, characterization comes up short and the change/emotional evolution the characters make in their journey through life is that they die; no wonderous revelations about their lives (at least by the characters themselves), no lessons learned, no growth, etc.--basically, the characters are dead and that's about it. If you like books that are idea driven, you will like it. If you crave books that are character-drive, look elsewhere. -MQ"
3,Imaginitive Description!,"The author certainly puts thought into his words. I was amazed. This book was on a recommended list by Michael Cunningham (author of THE HOURS). I certainly see what Cunningham saw in this exquisitely original piece that did win the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. I'm only giving it three stars because the subject matter (a murder and the aftermath description of the decaying bodies) is disturbing. It made me think twice when the author wrote:'Life is. It goes. It does not count. That was the hurtling truth that comes to rattle everyone as they grow up, grow old.'I almost resented that line--because in my view...Life does matter and does count...by giving, sharing and touching...we pass on wonderful things to future lives. I did LOVE when the author wrote 'Love songs transcend, transport...' It's too bad a compilation CD didn't accompany the book. I'd love to hear the tunes that the author would select. Enjoy--if you so choose."
2,Silly English Narrative 2.5 stars,"Interesting idea but boring execution, and I do not dislike difficult fiction. The writing here is soporific and a bit sanctimonious. Two dull people with an estranged daughter are murdered on the beach where they first met and proceed to decay. The author immediately distances himself from any human considerations but attempts to pull at our emotions by describing the elements, the scavenger creatures, the grass losing color, etc. Never does it become engrossing. A minor author of a quirky, somewhat interesting book. Save your money."
2,A Fine Line Between Being Dead and Being Boring...,"The author slips over this line once too often to rate the book above 2 stars - and that's in a fairly slim book (just under 200 pages).The forward by backward by forward tale of this couple's ultimate day alive - the details of a past that had them returning to this spot - the nature of animals being their passion and study - and their passion as animals being the authors study - how time moves on and through all of us without paying much notice to us.However, the author spends a great deal of time examining their lives which really are practically unfulfilled and fairly dull lives to begin with - in deep scientific detail. What they had for breakfast, what clothes they wore, how much and how little they actually feel for one another at various moments throughout the day -But no one ever really wakes up or comes to life - so it comes to matter very little - even to their daughter - whether the couple is alive or dead."
4,Death before Life,"Mr. Crace pulls off a lyrcial, wondrous and amazing feat: death and decomposition join life and love. A middle-aged couple are murdered during their return to the beach where they first made love over thirty years ago. The bodies are not discovered by humans for six days. Instead, we witness what time and other members of the animal kingdom will do to the dead. Meanwhile, the author deftly informs us how this couple got to be in this place at this time."
3,Beautifully written but maddeningly imagined,"Yes, he writes a lovely line and yes his long thinking on mortality was intriguing and yes he took a risk by offering us rather unsympathetic characters. However, I found the combination of the heavy-handed omniscient voice--in which the author is constantly hectoring us with his observations and injunctions--sat very oddly next to the clinical description of this couple's death. Just when I was beginning to fall under the spell of his closely observed gorgeous prose, he would alienate and infuriate me. Not a winner for me!"
3,"Descriptions beautiful, story wanting.","I loved Quarantined. The story unique, the writing so wondrous I reread lines many times. However, this book although the first few chapters were captivating in the same manner, the story did not keep me interested. I did not care for any of the characters, nor did I care for the place so vividly described. I really wanted to like this book. C'est la vie."
2,a sad tale,"Being Dead is a well-written, at times even engrossing, novel, but is essentially bleak. Author Jim Crace provides a literary ""quivering"" for Joseph and Celise, the murdered protagonists, going back in stages to fill in details of both their last day and their 30 year marraige.The problem for me is that the author's ""secular"" view of life and death is depressing. Maybe some find the idea that we live, we die, and that is all there is to it, comforting. I find it grim. Add to my fundamental disagreement in outlook the fact that neither Joseph nor Celise was very happy with their marraige, their daughter, or life in general, and the whole thing is a real downer."
1,Not worth the read,The book was very gory - I read the book for a book club and that's the only reason I didn't stop after the first couple of chapters. There was no story - no point.
1,Disappointed,"Since you know the ending at the beginning there are no major surprises, just the story of how this couple lives led to their murder. Did not find characters appealing or interesting. If you like the idea of a story being told from ending to beginning, then rent ""Momento""."
5,The ground almost swallowing them whole,"I was pleasantly surprised at what an excellent book this was. I read a review from the New York Times and one from Salon that touted Crace's writing style - and they were right.The tale jumps to different time periods intertwining the reader into Joseph and Celice's lives. The two are indiscriminately killed; it frankly doesn't matter why they were killed because this is a book about death, not dying. Their deaths and decomposition is analyzed in detail as well as their daughter's uncertainty while her parents are rotting in the Baritone Bay dunes. It sounds morbid, but it is actually quite fascinating and beautiful - for these two the circle of life was practically complete - the ground almost swallowing them whole.As disturbing as the title is for some of you, this book I think you will find this to be a wonderful story about death and maybe give some meaning to what death is - I don't purport to say that I have figured it out though."
1,Buyer Beware,"It took almost ten(10)weeks longer than expected to get a copy of my policy, and that was after 2 attempts to get a refund. Good luck in reaching anyone by phone in thier company customer service line.I was actualy on hold for 1hour and 13 minutes the first time I tried to get some one before I hung up.Only after a threat of legal action and a mass boycot of amazon did some one finaly respond. Yet no one took my request for a refund seriously. They kept pushing this product down my throat. My advise to anyone concidering buying this product...do your research there are better choises out thier with better customer service and more effective."
3,replacement does not seem as easy,I purchased this because on the Amazon description it looked like replacement covered everything and was easy. After recieving the paperwork from the company it appears to have exclusions which were not mentioned in the amazon write up. I have not had to use it but I would not purchase it again.
1,a legal scam,"I'm disappointed to find that Amazon would provide a channel for this sort of thing. Extended warranty and product replacement insurance like this are just a legal form of gambling. They are betting you won't collect, and believe me, the odds are very much in favor of the house here. You lose.If you don't believe me, go to Consumer Reports and read what they have to say about this. You are just throwing your money away. Instead, if you must worry, a) buy products that have a good reputation and b) use a credit card that offers purchase protection (many do)."
5,great plan!,"I was so excited that not only did I buy a Zune mp3 player for way less than in major retail stores, but I received the benefits usually seen at major stores. This service plan is great, and I will continue to buy from Amazon!"
1,"Not necessary, use your credit card protection!","Many credit cards offer up to 1 year's manufacturer's warranty, see if you qualify for that before throwing your money away on a separate warranty. This just isn't worth it! Get yourself that new Blu-ray movie you've been eyeing instead ;)"
4,Excellent but not with POI,I think it is generally a good navigator. However I've found in it some areas in a town that the map is old. In addition the POI are not very many (it does not have WALMART in its memory but your can easily save a new address in its memory). I have saved some of my interesting points in its addresbook manually. By the way it is still a good navigator and I know they are working to upgrade its software to improve the POI numbers and the Map.
4,no news is good news,"I haven't had to use this replacement plan, so I have no idea how it works. So far, so good."
4,Well Written and Still Relevant,"Nicholas Gordon deftly takes the reader through a real-life web of intrigue that runs from the lowest level poacher's assistant all the way up to the highest levels of the Tanzanian government. The problems of funding, manpower, and loyalty that plague the wardens who protect the wildlife are all carefully explored and often vividly illustrated by the situations that Gordon finds himself in. This book is full of unforgettable stories, such as the one about the warden who built a landing strip in the middle of the jungle without the benefit of any machinery, and the story of the nerve-wracking flight that Gordon and his guide take across the jungle in an aged, rickety Cessna that had been already been crashed once, by the same pilot who is flying them at that moment. The poaching described by Gordon is still a problem in Tanzania, and I expect that Gordon's documentation and analysis of the problem is still relevant."
4,Exelent watch for the right price,"It's big and looks cool, the only problem I had It's that I bought the one with the blue dial and they send me one with a black dial because they sold out; but the black dial looks fine too."
5,awesome,this is a classic miami bass album all the songs are great with that party feel!A must have for that miami bass collection
4,Very happy with my purchase.,"I bought this system from BB for $189. I give it 4 stars because this system has digital coaxial audio and NO optical. My Samsung LCD 37 inch HDTV does NOT have digital coax (it has optical, of course). I just ordered a digital coax cable from monoprice thinking I also had a coax out on my TV. Now, I'm sort of stuck because I don't have the ""other end connections"" for either type of cable. Live and learn. :) I suppose the next step now would be to get a converter but before I jump in and do this, anyone have any suggestions? I didn't want to limit myself to just using the RCA audio cables, but if I'm stuck, I guess that's what I may have to do. Any suggestions would be appreciated.Other than that, this is a great inexpensive system worth purchasing if you don't want to spend a lot of money."
2,Shop Around,"Check out your electronic sales circular. Prices have been varying wildly from 149 to 250. I set up my unit yesterday, was fairly easy except I connected a wrong cable and couldn't get my video to work. I called Phillips tech support and was told I had a faulty unit and I should ship it back to Philips at my expense. I finally got it to work on my own. Sound sounds great but there are no treble or bass adjustments, you have to live with the factory settings. The dvd drawer is very flimsy and cheaply made it wobbles. If I had to do it again, I buy another make like Samsung or LG which were in the same price range."
2,Look else where if you want something that lasts,"Well the receiver has finally died on me after maybe 7 months. I never used the DVD player in it so dont know how good it worked. Basically had direct tv/360 plugged into it. Sound was better than the TV speakers, but still I believe there are better deals out there than any Phillips.When buying this really pay attention to the negative reviews. They are spot on. I've been checking out AVS lately to make sure my next system is a big upgrade and more than likely not that much difference in price range.Please stay away if you want a product that can last."
5,Philips HTS3555 Home Theater System with iPod Connectivity (Black),"MOST EXCELLENT system for the low price & easy to hook up! Connected to our Philips 47"" HDTV (black). I recommend you use the HDMI cables by ""Cables To Go (6.5ft) Velocity HDMI Digital Video Cable (Blue)"", which are also LOW priced and available through Amazon.com."
2,"Finicky for 4 years, and now it's dead","We owned this unit for four years, and were generally happy with sound qality much better than our tv set. However, it often needed to be unplugged and replugged in order to get it to turn on. Finally, it just stopped turning on altogether."
1,Very poor Frequency response..,"I saw one for sale on Craigslist for $50.00 and was curious so I checked the specifications and found out that the frequency response is 180Hz -14kHz which is very poor. This means it cannot reproduce lower end(bass) below 180Hz and higher frequencies above 14kHz(14,000Hz). This maybe fine for mp3 players where they compress data to fit in more information. In normal case an amplifier should have a frequency response from 20Hz to 20kHz(20,000Hz).This product maybe fine for most people, but if you are a serious listener who like high fidelity sound with more detail... do not buy this."
5,Worth every penny,"I received this home theater system for my birthday last September, and let me say, it is the best present that I have ever dropped a hint for. I had an iHome that died and I wanted something else to play my iPod on and listen to the radio with. An exact replacement iHome was $100, but I got lucky and I stumbled upon this. This thing puts out amazing power, I can use it as an iPod player, as a radio, and so much more. The DVD player makes standard definition DVDs look a little better than my old dvd player as well. As others have mentioned, it is hard to upgrade or change the length of the wires, but that is the only downside to it. For the price, you can't beat it."
2,You get what you pay for,"The first one I got was defective and would not recognize discs. However, Amazon was great and sent a new one within a few days. But it's not a very high quality system. The disc drive is very cheaply made and feels like its about to break every time you put a disc in. The speakers are OK, but again pretty cheaply made. The people who wrote that it sounds as good as more expensive systems have obviously never heard good systems. But for the price, it is pretty good.On the plus side it has some great features. I can use my iPod and iPhone in the dock, which most of the more expensive systems don't feature. It also has a USB port, and works great with a flash drive. I really wanted the iPod dock, but if your looking for quality, and don't care about that, spend the extra hundred bucks and get a real system."
2,"Good sound, if it works...","First off, the sound quality is good, and everything works great as listed in product description. The problem comes a little down the road, after about 6-8 months, the receiver went out. Took it back, told it was not repairable, and it was replaced under warranty. That causes no quarrels; they make warranties for a reason. The next thing, another 8-10 months down the road, same problem. It simply won't turn back on after being off. There has to be some kind of malfunction with the unit due to immense amount of problems reported online. Had the same problem not occurred twice, within a similar time frame, then I'd give this unit 4 stars. It's good as long as it turns on, but I would be sure to get a warranty."
5,Purchased 3 years ago,I purchased this one over 3 years ago and to this day it works great. Still seems like I just received it and hooked everything up. I would buy it again.
1,Junky McJunkerson,"Just poorly designed and clunky in every way. But it is a Home Theater System for $200, so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. But seriously, in this day and age it is startling to see an electronic component so incredibly user unfriendly.It's junk, but it's my junk until it is replaced - with something other than a Philips..."
2,"You get what you pay for, JUNK!","This system looks and sounds good... For about one year. Just like the Philips HTIB wehad before this one,it works good for a year (or less) then it says, ""no disc"". This is the last Philips we will ever buy.Save your money. Get a Panasonic or Sony. This one is in the shop.When we get it back, I'm sure it will not last more than a year.Philips makes JUNK."
1,Could have started my house on fire!,"I had my HTS3555 for almost two years when one day it wouldn't work. I went up to it to find out what the issue was and it smelled like burned plastic. I plugged it to a spot where I could see the back more easy and when I turned it on again, it was sparking and smoking. If I wouldn't have come home when I did, my house could have burned down!"
3,Great for beginners,I bought this from sears and it is great for beginners. ipod dock even works with the touch. cords are thin and sever easily. good sound but not great. no optical in so that is also a negative. only a tv and aux in spot along with a jack in and usb. has lasted me a year but is beginning to go out.
1,Didn't work out of the box,"I can't tell you how good the sound or the video is, all I can say is that the dvd unit didn't even turn on out of the box, and there was nothing I could do, since I live in Venezuela the item arrived about 4 months after I ordered it so neither amazon or the courier made themselves responsibles for the unit, so for me the home theater is just another box in the trash can."
5,Great system for a great price!!!,"I just got it today. Well I must say I`m very impressed by huge ammount of features, like Ipod dock,HDMI Port with 1080i upconversion, playable Divx movies and USB port. This is excelent entry level home theater for a great price comparing to other system avalible on the market today.A very intersting point is that this home theater has an option of firmware upgrade so it's possible to update the software for this home theater when it does become avalible online, which is obviously great and gives an option of improvements and even adding some new features. Don't hesitate to buy If you're looking for an excellent entry level home theater system."
4,Excellent Value for money,"The sound on this system is quite good, both for DVDs and for audio CDs. Setup was easy because of color coded cables. I replaced an AIWA Shelf system and a Sony DVD player with this all-in-one and I am quite pleased with the result. It produces better treble quality than my AIWA used to and it plays many different formats of video without any trouble. The only negative I can mention is that the remote becomes unresponsive at times for no apparent reason (though this may be a problem with my unit). Turning the system on and off usually solves the problem. I don't have a hi-dev TV so I cannot comment on HD picture quality."
2,Simply not as good as 'Stay Awake'.,"While this album has its amusing moments, it cannot live up to its predecessor, 'Stay Awake'. While the selections of songs performed include favorites such as 'Kiss the Girl' and 'The Bare Necessities', the interpretations presented by the various artists lack inspiration. Not an album for the collector of any of the individual artists to pass up, but also not one to worry about missing from the collection."
3,It's in English . . . sort of,"If you are looking for a minimally adequate ""Don Pasquale,"" here it is. I take it on faith that the (adequate) singers are warbling in English--although long passages might just as well be in Serbo-Croatian or Old Icelandic.""Don Pasquale"" is, nevertheless, a true comic and melodic gem that rises above even the most ham-handed, mush-mouthed performance, hence the three stars."
2,Buy A La Media Noche Instead,"I bought this CD for one reason: the first track: Lambada and the third track: Dancando Lambada. Once I listened to the CD, I realized they are really the only listenable songs on the disc.They were trying to start a new dance craze, so they created the song Lambada in ten versions with same words and different rhythm, but none of the remixes match the original. The songs get boring quickly, because they're all fast dancing songs. The two best tracks (1 and 3) can be found in other collections (like Lambada Brazil and Romantic Collection), respectively.Kaoma's other CD ""A La Media Noche"" is a keeper, however. Buy it, and a couple good collections instead of this album."
3,Music to movie Lambada,"For those who liked the movie Lambada the Forbidden Dance, as far as I can tell this is the only CD to find at least the main song from the movie. If there's a soundtrack album for this movie I've certainly never been able to lay hands on it. But the one song from the movie is the only good one on this album.Rejane"
2,Worked ok for about 2.5 years,"The alarm stopped functioning after about 2.5 years!As an alarm clock in the bedroom this was great while functioning. It is easy to use and programme. The display brightness can be turned from bright to off by pressing the snooze button on the top - great when you're half asleep and want to know the time without having to think too much and you can then turn the display off so as not to be disturbed by it. Compact size is good.Usual functions of sleep, snooze and dual alarms.The sound quality is what I would expect from an alarm clock radio, audiobooks aren't too bad but I wouldn't choose to sit and listen to music on it.Radio reception in our area is not good and this unit struggles to get a good signal."
3,It will work with an I pod Touch! contrary to what Phillips says in its support forum,"Even though Phillips says it does not work with the i touch ipod ""because apple changed its hardware"" If you 1. turn on the ipod 2. set the ipod on the music you want to wake up to 3. press the Ipod button on the Phillips player and 4. ""dock"" the ipod, you will not have any trouble using all features the Phillip player has to offer!!"
2,Yes and No,I like the design and it works well with my Ipod. I just cannot believe that you can't adjust the volume when using the alarm. How bizarre! How many other alarm clocks have that problem? And the display (at dim) is still too bright. I have always thought of Phillips being a quality brand and I am really surprised to find these problems with the unit. I am unfortunately tempted to return it.
2,Beware Really Loud alarm!,"Overall this product is ok but the biggest issue I have is that when using the iPod for your alarm it comes on at a low volume and gets really really loud really quickly. It's ok for just listening to your iPod, but the alarm is not good at all!"
1,Horrible Alarm and Poor Customer Service from Philips,"I purchased this item to play music (radio or iPod) to have my little boy wake up gently with music playing. Unfortunately, the system has an override that shoots the volume up from 0 to 20 whether you use the radio or iPod. There is no way to have alarm music play gently. This is not indicated on the package. The only alarm volume control comes with the buzzer option.I contact Philips with the hope of exchanging the product for a simpler model that had a traditional volume-set alarm, and was told that exchange, even for a lesser product, was not an option. It didn't occur to me that I would run into this trouble, so did not save the box, so cannot return to vendor. Shame on me. I will not buy Philips products in the future knowing their customer service ('sorry we can't reach our managers except by writing a letter') is wholly hands-tied and unable to individually address customer complaints ('...the policy says...) Find another product."
2,"Great sound, No battery B/up","This Phillips IPod clock radio has great sound. It compensates for the fact that MP-3 format clips low frequency sound. I just can't understand that they designed a clock radio without a back-up battery. Also the lighted display is too bright, even at 'dim' for a bedroom. I had to turn it away from the bed, but then can't see the display. The alarm (or Radio) comes on quiet, but quickly gets too loud. An anoyance if you just want to listen for 15 more minutes. The 'manual' is just a sheet of paper and lacks detail. I did return it for the above reasons, primarily the lack of back up battery. Poor design should not be rewarded.I replaced it with the Timex Mod. T617S that does have back up battery and C D player. It don't have a iPod jack, but does have a MP-3 input and pillow speaker output. I can still connect my iPod shuffle. It works great and does have a display dim enough to be next to my bed.Harold"
2,Shuts off after two minutes,"I purchased this unit a week ago. The sound was great for the price. However, it won't stay on. My husband and I have tried many ways to get the unit to power on and stay on. We called Philips Customer service and they said to exchange it at the store. Did that yesterday. The new unit does the same thing. I have the iPod Classic. Don't know if it's a compatibiliy issue or if I'm just unlucky. Wish it worked! The sound is rich for the price."
2,Major Alarm Flaw,"This radio looks good and sounds good, but for use as an alarm clock sucks. The ""gentle wake"" feature must be for people with no patience as it goes from quiet to jet engine loud in about 2 seconds. And first thing in the morning you think it will stop getting louder, but just as you think it's at maximum level, it goes up 2 more levels. It would be perfect if the wake up level could be adjusted. But it can't. Bummer dude."
4,Great for office,I got this as a gift for my hubby. He wanted to listen to his ipod at work. This does the job very nicely. We like the look of it and that it does not take up much room. Price was right.
1,I would definitely recommend this radio,I really like this radio. I purchased it to listen to my iPod in the kitchen. It has a really good sound and it is so easy to use. It fits all 3 of our family's iPods because of the different docking choices. I like the remote however I wish you could control the iPod panel with it. All you can do with the remote is go forward and back and adjust the volume - you can't navigate using the menu on your iPod. I think it is a great purchase for the money.
3,"Okay, with some flaws","It's pretty good for what it is -- a very compact radio/iPod player with an alarm function. The other reviewer is right that there's no way to adjust the music volume on the alarm -- it comes on gradually, but always goes to full volume. And it's loud! You can adjust it then, but who wants to lean over the second you wake up and fiddle with the buttons? That is the item's biggest problem in my view. The sound quality is also just so-so, but what do you expect from a 2-inch speaker, right? Another feature that is common on other clock radios, but missing here, is a nap alarm function. That would have been a good addition. I decided to keep it and live with the flaws, but it was a close call."
2,"Really really wanted to keep this, but...","I received this as a surprise Christmas gift and I was thrilled. It appeared to be a perfect bedside alarm clock. As others here have mentioned though, probably the biggest strike against this product is the inability to preset the alarm volume. Others have mentioned they thought the external FM antenna was ugly. I'm just glad there was one as my favorite station has a weak signal.This unit appears to do all, charge ipod, dock, wake up modes, three brightness levels, two alarm clocks, snooze button, compact appealing design. It is with great regret that I will probably have to return this unit due to the Alarm clock volume problem.There appears to be no equal products. This little Philips unit definately struck an emotional chord with me, initially. Its going to be hard to box it up."
3,"Great dock, bad alarm",Its a great product except the alarm volume can't be adjusted so unless you like being woken up by REALLY loud music its not the alarm clock for you.
2,Giving it away,"I bought this without seeing it. I thought 'we love penguins so it can't be bad'. It is. It follows the rhyme pattern of Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed only THIS DOESN'T RHYME. It was painful to read aloud. While the artwork is adorable, the lack of rhyme and flow just grated. The kids (7, 7 and 3) thought it was fun, but haven't asked for it again and haven't missed it since I put it in the 'give away' box."
4,great gift,I gave this as a gift to each of two friends who asked for guidance on where to learn English and they are very pleased with it.
1,Quality control absent,"There was constant noise on this videotape, to the extent that it's really unlistenable. With Kathleen Battle, Seiji Ozawa, and the Berlin Philharmonic in performance, this could have been on everyone's list of favorites. The Philips Video Classics people never should have released something this unfortunate."
2,"Save the Heavy Breathing for the Bedroom, Not the Recording Studio!","I must agree with the other reviewers bothered by Galbraith's heavy breathing. With earphones on, I felt like the guy's nose was about an inch from my ear. An injection of the ridiculous into the sublime!"
2,Style over Substance,"While this recording does indeed showcase the harmonic possibilities of the 8-string guitar's extended range, Galbraith does little to prove he understands Baroque music. The rhetorics of Bach seems to be lost in Galbraith's emotionally detached performance. Especially noticeable in the Grave of the 2nd Violin Sonata, which should be played with a larger range of dynamics and much more improvisatory vigor. A real disappointment."
4,Not bad at all!,"I had purchased this CD because I am currently working on a Bach Partita (no. 2) on Violin and I wanted the Guitar version. Galbraith is a wonderful performer. Although the Ciaccona in the Partita is a little slow, it's still great! I highly recommend it! Happy listening!"
3,Background noise,"Good music and excellent performance.But there are too much background noise(may be it is the breath sound), especially hear the music using headphone.I could not accept that because it is a solo guitar music that requires pure sound quality."
4,Hummel's Double Concerto for Piano & Violin,"This engaging CD has two works for piano by Johann Nepomuk Hummel, a contemporary of Beethoven, who was one of his teachers. There is less individuality of style here than in, say the a minor and b minor concertos. The Piano Concerto No.4 in E Major sounds very much as if it could have been written by Mozart, though it was composed in 1814 - a couple of decades after the death of Mozart. Like Hummel's other piano concertos it was written for himself to play. The other work on the CD is the Double Concerto for Violin and Piano in G Major - rather more inventive, though composed a decade earlier than the piano concerto. The performers here are Howard Shelley (piano) and Hagai Shaham (violin) with the London Mozart Players. Altogether a very enjoyable and musically interesting disc recorded by Chandos in 1998."
4,SO who died and made you God???,"This album rocks. Nothing really different, but they were heavy and had a good groove! You'd love it."
2,Bias and misunderstanding of economics,"While there is some interesting information in the book, it seems to be riddled with errors and sloppy research. It also has quite an amount of bias - for example Strathern says that the three greatest economists are Marx, Smith and Keynes. Marx isn't even an economist. Further - 'Franklin D. Roosevelt, the greatest president of all'. He might have been a reasonable president - but the greatest of all?? The Great Depression didn't prove Keynes right. Actually, the New Deal slowed the growth of the US out of the depression (see for example the recent International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook 2002 (recoveries and recessions). There are many other errors in economics understanding. (This book is titled 'Dr Strangelove's Game' in Australia"
2,Too difficult for seniors with physical limitations,"My elderly dad, who regularly attends yoga classes for seniors, found this too difficult. He loves other chair yoga videos, though."
1,Thrift? I'll say...,"The gentleman's assessment below is KIND, if anything. This translation isn't even fit to recycle."
4,Security,"I have been using these type of Master Locks for over 10 yrs, and been happy with them. The oldest of them was this model, and was exposed to weather, and infrequent use. The lock it self was discolored, but always functioned for me. I have 4 or 5 locks of this type, but different models. One disadvantage is that they can be difficult to operate in sever cold tempertures below zero. I frequently juices all my padlocks up with WD 40, about monthly. I do like the fact the locks are combo, and if I lock the keys inside, or forget my keys, or lose them, I can always get into my house. I do know of a friends lock that failed, and could not be re-opened. I did have a problem with one lock myself, but at the time I was thought some grit got into mechanism, so I cleaned that out, and have not had problems since."
1,Loses combination,"I had this on a garage door I didn't open very much. I used my birth year, figured I wouldn't forget that. I hadn't opened the lock for several years, but it was exposed to weather.Today I opened the lock, but it did not open at the original combination. Luckily It popped open while I was spinning the last two wheels to get to the correct combination and I was able to remove the lock. Now it will not open at either the correct combination or the one that did open it.I'll be taking a Dremel to it to see what went wrong and have a SesameSesamee Keyless Padlocks Sesame Brass/Steel Shackle Padlockon order."
1,master lock junk,bought two of these locks to put on the hasps on my two trailers the locks were on the trailers about a month and i could not get them to open finally knocked them open and then they would not close a can of wd40 later and they are still hard to open and close these locks are junk if you use them outside
2,Hard to use at gym,"This is a pretty big lock that might be good for anything else except as a gym lock. I had hard time closing and opening it in a gym. After several attempts, I finally got it to close. If you're looking for a gym lock, you might not want this item."
3,childhood doll,"I had this doll as a child and oh how I missed her. So, when I purchased it through Amazon, I was amazed at the price. So affordable. I was a bit disappointed at her body as it doesn't look like the one from the 50's, but the face is the same. So pretty. I would recommed her to anyone who is contemplating purchasing her. Clef"
2,Beautiful but broke,"My almost 3 year old got this beautiful doll for Christmas. She really likes it and likes to style her hair. Unfortunately, less than two weeks after Christmas, her arm broke off as my daughter had her wave ""bye-bye."" This is not a ""pop"" back in joint, there is a plastic piece inside that broke. She was not abused, just played with."
5,Terri Lee doll,"Es una muñeca muy bonita, con excelentes detalles que la complementan como son los zapaticos, el cepillo y la pasta de dientes.Mis hijas quedaron encantadas!!"
1,The Great War; An Imperial History,"I have been waiting for a book on this subject for many years. Unfortunately, this is a sad commentary on so-called scholarship. The author states in the preface: ""... seeks to broaden knowledge ... new perspectives on the war ... most formative experience of the twentieth century, as the US government embarks upon an imperial venture early in the 21st century"". However, it is not knowledge he seeks to broaden but his own racial prejudice. I found the underlying theme to be how the poor black soldiers were subjected to prejudice. This isn't a history but another ""poor little me, I,m black and the evil white man has abused me"". There are many views of the war - his is dismissive of the efforts of all who were caught up in the conflict. The preface clearly states his prejucice - he is anti-American, anti-white, and is a pathetic effort to illuminate a major trauma of the last century. How sad."
1,Horrible,"Made the mistake of seeing the reviews and stars and bought ""return"" and this one. Saw ""return"" first and was one of the most ridiculous films i've ever seen. the ""original"" is marginally better, as in a 1 out 10 while ""return"" a zero."
1,Bad BAD BAD,"Looks good but looks arnt everyting when it comes to electorinics, and i have had numerous problems with this and its spent more times geting fixed than ive been able to listin ot it. ive had all the same problems as everyone else too!"
1,Nice unit on the outside,"My son purchased on of these on 12/31/2001.On April 15th, 2002 it was dead. Simply dead, no power. Changed batteries and used the ac adaptor.It will cost more to repair it that he paid and Aiwa is unsympathetic.Steer clear of Aiwa."
4,product description is wrong,"It should be noted that this unit, despite the Amazon.com description, does not have a built in exercise monitor (""This unit also incorporates equalization circuitry with preprogrammed settings (classical, pop/rock, and jazz) that you can quickly and easily select to keep your music sounding the best. Also included is a built-in exercise monitor that lets you set your own training goals."") ... While I was disappointed about the lack of features advertized, I agree that the CD player is very durable, has very nice sound, and has never skipped (I've used it for at least 2 dozen work-outs). However, if you are looking for music specific equalization circuitry or an exercise monitor, you won't find one in this model."
2,Not Recommended,"I wish I had returned this, but it's been awhile, so I guess I'm stuck with it. I bought this walkman to use on my commuter bus to block out ""loud talkers."" Okay, it does accomplish that just fine. However, it is not very loud and the extra bass is either not enough or too much, thereby causing distortion. Like other reviewers have written, the headphone jack is just bizarre. If you move the headphone jack, it makes a fuzzy, static noise, and on my particular walkman, if I touch the headphone jack, the walkman beeps at me and skips to the next song!! SO ANNOYING!! Save your blood pressure, don't buy this!"
5,If you love Jazz and Swing You'll eat this up,Love this CD. It has the most exciting Jazz-Swing score done for Broadway in many years. It also has the wittiest lyrics. I had the pleasure of seeing the show on Broadway - with this cast. It was nothing short of amazing how well the songs fit the characters (those who haven't seen the show - read the plot outline - it helps). Some may think the vocal quality is lacking but the songs are so character driven that this is a less important consideration. Would highly recommed this for anyone who loves witty lyrics and a big band sound.
3,"Coleman shines, lyrics tank","Honestly I had hoped for much more from this musical. I mean, I'm a fan of noir and Cy Coleman!But I find the lyrics so cheesy they make the music unlistenable.Of couple of tracks, however, are outstanding and worth a listen:""With Every Breath I Take""""You Can Always Count on Me"""
2,"Good Cast, Bad Score","This show has an amzing concept, flipping from black to white; and having the film parellel life. But, the score does not live up to the rest of the production. While I know that a jazz score is nedded for a 40s dectective show, as I listened to teh CD, I found the score sounded like it should be played and sung at a mediocre jazz caberet. I do think, however that the cast is magnificent! They all fit their parts and vocal expectations perfectly (escpecially the ""scat-singing"" ensamble)! Altogether, I gave the OCR 2 stars, because the score is listenable, although the singers are fanstastic. But the bad score does out way the stench of the score. Unless you don;t mind going to mediocre jazz caberets, don't by this CD!"
4,I recommend the Original London Cast,"I know that it is probably a scandal to like better a soundtrack other that the Original Broadway, but I must insist that the talent is of a higher caliber. If you can compare the two soundtracks especially of the characters of Stine and Jimmy Powers you'll understand. Plus, there are songs included in the London soundtrack that are omitted from the Broadway."
5,This Amazing Musical is One of Broadway's Finest Ever!!,"I think that the originality of both the plot and the score make this one of the best modern musicals. Sadly, it is uncredited because of its relatively short run. Its all jazz score is incredible and unique. I reccomend it to any Broadway buff! If you like jazz, you'll love ""City of Angels""!!"
4,Love It! Love It!,"I saw this show at a community theater and thought it was a bore. However, later I bought the C.D. and found that I really loved the music. I catch myself humming the tunes to myself at work even if I haven't listened to it for a while. It is a must for anyone's Broadway collection."
5,Very Comfortable,"When I first saw these, they weren't quite what I had hoped for--they reminded me of another pair of sandals I had purchased that I ended up throwing away. But to my surprise, I love them! First, they have an adjustable strap. My left foot is wider than my right, so I was able to adjust accordingly. Second, they are cushiony and nice leather. I'm so glad I bought them! Too bad it is winter!"
2,A disappointment,"There isn't much available on this artist, so I was anxious to get this book. My enthusiasm was misplaced, because the book is a major disappointment. Granted, it was written a long time ago, but the style of writing is distractingly awkward. Most surprisingly, this book contains the worst printed plates I have ever seen. They are black and white. Not greyscale, but literally black and white. Some pictures have been improperly scaled in one dimension. This is inexcusable. There is some value in the text, but not even close to the book's cost. If you have been looking for a good book on Perugino, I suggest you keep looking."
4,Replacement Solenoid Housing,"I bought this to replace the housing (plastic cover) on my M8000 winch. The original had turned a milky white probably due to being in the sun. This one is a perfect fit, of course, since it is a Warn part. You do have to drill out the original connector rivets and disconnect the wires from the solenoids to move the connector to the new housing. Just make a sketch of the wiring before removing anything. I would suggest using stainless steel (SS) hardware (no connector mounting hardware is included) to mount the connector on the new housing. I would also suggest using SS locknuts on the back side to make sure they do not back off due to vibration and fall into the high current wiring (that goes straight to the battery) of the solenoids. I hope this one does not fade out like the last one. Time will tell. It would have been better if the connector mounting hardware was included."
2,Even fans can skip this one,"Queens biggest hits are represented here, but there's no point in listening to these versions. The musicians are all unnamed studio musicians. They perform well enough, but add nothing to the songs they perform.There are three other Queen tribute albums that I know of. They both feature famous artists and are generally good. The artists on those albums put their own spin on the songs. The musicians on this album, however try to sound as much like the original versions as they can. Since that's the case, listening to the original versions is better.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Even the most hardcore Queen fans will find nothing worthwhile here."
2,Ehh...,"I was pretty excited to get mine because it seemed perfect for my needs. But two things went wrong, maybe only one. Once I got it I couldn't hear audio through the headset itself, I thought it might be my controller because it does that but I tried it on multiple. And the other, which is minor depending on how you feel about this sort of thing, is that it picks up other peoples voices in the room pretty well. So if you and your friends are raging while playing Halo, everyone could probably hear them as well, not just you.So...ehh... Otherwise it's pretty comfortable, stays on, user-friendly, and does what it is supposed to do (partly). I like the concept, but I think I might of been sent a defective one, otherwise I'd give it a 4."
3,Could be better...,"This headset DOES NOT work with a 3rd party controller. Well, it does, but there is terrible feedback and echoing on the other end (I used a Mad Catz controller). It worked just fine in a Microsoft branded controller, although the voice was a bit muffled. The way it sits on your ear is also somewhat uncomfortable, and slightly perplexing when you just look at it and think ""Wait, how does this thing fit on my ear?"" I would recommend the Plantronics Under Ear headset over this one, simply because it works better and is more comfortable, but these two headsets (and the official Microsoft one) are the only headsets I've used. For quality, the Microsoft is the best, but the under ear headset is more comfortable. Make your decision based on what's most important to you, or just take a chance with one of the many other headsets available and hope you find something better."
3,Xbox 360 - Earbud,This product is great - what an asset to have for the system. Easy to use - would recommend purchasing this item.
4,Nice headset,"I bought this one, and is my first headset. I can hear people talk loud and clear. However, i always have it in mute, because it makes an horrible noise, and this bothers the other players. It sounds like interference, but I have tried everything. I will try another one, but I read that a lot of people are having this problem with this headset.It is very comfortable and have light weight."
3,ok for a while,"i bought this a while back and it proved to be a great headset until it died. it worked great for a few months or so then it slowly started to die, my friends would tell me they cant hear me or hear static or a very loud high pitched beeping noise, and now they cant hear me at all, and i just trashed it, i have since upgraded to the gamecom x30s."
1,crap,i bought this headset awhile back it's junk i take care of my stuff and it craped out way to soon dont buy this one spend a little extra cash get something better than this waste of plastic crap i personally HATED IT uncomfortable as if i was stabbing my ear with toothpick garunteed the first thing to go is the switch and volume control all junk
3,Painful after a while,"If you are looking for an option when your wireless dies, this is perfect. If you are looking for a full time headset you may want to look somewhere else.Intermittent crackling and background noise is common, and after a while the clip that goes on your ear gets rather painful.On a good note, the sound quality is good both with the mic and the speaker. I would purchase something else if I had chance."
3,You get what you paid for.,To be straight up honest the mic is uncomfortable/hurts. However since I bought the mike brand new for dirt cheap I can't complain to much. I still use the mic every time I play online with my clan and no one has complained so far about the quality.
1,The noise-El ruido,"This product doesn't works. My friends just says to me: please turn off your microphone, nobody cant understand me anything. I prefer the original from xbox360. I wasted my money.Amigos no se los recomiendo, la verdad, tiene muy buen sonido pero solo para escuchar para hablar es imposible, todos mis amigos me piden que lo apague porque es imposible escucharme ya que se escucha un ruido cuando nadie esta hablando. Fue una compra perdida."
2,Below expectations from Plantronics,"I decided to go with a name brand head set for my XBOX 360 play and I had to immediately return the device. The sound was just so so and the ear piece was pretty comfortable, but the mike picked up every sound imaginable. You cannot use this product if you are not wearing headphones. It will provide wayyyyy too much feedback for your friends playing the game with you. It was so sensitive, it even picked up the chips I was eating during the play. I had to remove the headset due to all the complaints from my friends on the other end. If you do not turn your game up very loud this may work for you. It did not work for me in my theater room, even with the sound kind of low."
3,"Works ok, hurts ear after a while.","This ear piece works ok enough, it just starts to hurt you ear after a while. It seemed to develop an connection problem and I would randomly not be able to talk to people in the game. Its sleek and seems to be of nice form though. Its cheap enough to. I'd recommend saving up for a wireless one."
4,Very sensitive be aware,This is a very sensitive headset and tends to pick up tons of background noise such as the noise from your TV. I like the way it feels in the ear and is nice to not have it fit over the top of your head. For the price it is worth getting though. Just be aware that it is very sensitive to sounds.
3,just not comfortable for longterm wearing,does what it says - but it was uncomfortable to me under the arms. I couldnt wear it long enough to serve the purpose. I even tried with a shirt underneath it.
5,Couldn't put it down,"This is the first Tananarive Due book I read. The story is so engrossing that I went to bed, kept thinking about the story and got up to finish the book. It made me laugh and cry, I hated the book to end. I read a lot and the story stayed with me for days. Ms. Due is a real talent and I'm looking forward to reading her other books but I doubt they can top The Good House. For fans of horror and suspense this is a must read, I enjoyed this book like and compare it to the early StephenKing books."
3,THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC,"THE GOOD HOUSE is a fairly good ghost story, replete with voodoo and evil demons (the baka). Ms. Due's prose is polished and well written. Most of her characters achieve a good realization, and her book seems well planned and focused. However, as suspense works go, the suspense comes in small doses and seems protracted and manipulative. The strongest presence in the book is the teaming of Corey Hill and Sean Leahy. Their friendship seems strongly bound by their ""differences"" and in their doom-making ""ritual"" that unleashes the terrifying baka. The book is cinematic in its structure, and there are few really frightening sequences. However, Ms. Due virtually negates her ghost story by its ""miracle"" ending. I like happy endings, but this one is so contrived and ridiculous, it leaves a bad taste.Due is obviously a talented writer, and her skills are evident. This just isn't that good a book."
2,Way too long!,"This book had a lot of potential. However, it's biggest downfall is it's length. I was very interested in the story, but I found it painful to finish. I just wanted it to end. The author got my attention with good character development and a great story set up. Then there was just too much drivel. For example, the author kept rehashing previous plot points through the view point of another character. This was interesting, but happened too many times. Don't get this book if you are not into the whole voodoo thing. And don't expect it to be scary."
1,Terrible,"Ripping off King, but with more sex, shallower characters, and a Hollywood ending. Leave it on the shelf."
3,The deadweight is in the details,"I am breaking a long-standing rule of mine and reviewing a product before I finish it. I'm giving this book three stars because that's the best rating I could conceivably give a book that took nearly 200 pages to get moving, regardless of what happens in the 400 remaining pages. Now that it's going, it's going nicely, but a much leaner and more chronologically linear approach to storytelling would have made for a much shorter and more effective first half. Also, if it is true, as I have read, that this book devotes a section to plugging the works of Due's husband, that would take another star off the rating; product placement in books is increasing, but that would be a new low. Looks like the editor was asleep at the wheel on this one."
1,A dud!,"This author likes to pepper her books with political rhetoric which I found distasteful because of the way she handles it. The characters in this book are not likeable or well developed. I only got to page 67, yes it's that bad."
1,Painful,"Not very scary, too long, and poor character development. There are a lot of good reviews about the book. Maybe I missed something."
5,"Highly durable, comfortable, and unique","Absolutely loved these shoes. Highly durable, comfortable, and a great way to show off your team spirit. Just wish I could find another pair as mine are finally wearing out."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I thought since this was ""Tool Exchange"" that I might be getting a good quality, resharpened American made bit.And it would be close to the size I really wanted.Turns out it is the same Chinese bit you could get at Harbor Freight or elsewhere.(Of course a fractional bit this size you might not find there).So what can I say. It's Chinese and you get what you pay for.I bought a Champion at Amazon after this one that I did use for my project. I could see the US stamping on that one in the picture. It was just 32nd inch larger.It cost more."
3,OK product.,"Quality if OK. It took me some time to season the pot and lid. Three times to get all spots oiled and seasoned on the BBQ. Absorbed A LOT of vegetable oil to season. Even after seasoning. My first attempt of using on the camp fire ended in recipe burning and baking into the cast iron. A real bear to clean up. I think I just need more practice cooking in a dutch oven. If I did over again, I might have purchased a pre-seasoned one."
5,"Awesome dutch oven, love it!",Great dutch oven. Did chili outside during a snow storm..Excellent quality and fast delivery ....highly recommend this product! I also bought the tripod for it.
2,Disposable Pill Bag,I was actually looking for a plastic bag that can store the pills for me to crush them in. This bag is surely not made for the purpose for it was punctured by the pills. Wrong purchase.
1,Bait and switch,"If you want the product advertised and described, do not order this--instead of the 2.5 mil bags described, they send flimsy 1 mil bags, an entirely different product with a different name. Amazon should take them off the site"
3,Not the same,"These bags are thinner, than they use to be. I like the thicker bags, because they last longer in your pocket, and can be reused.These are just OK."
4,Joshua Then and Now: Richler's Finest Novel,This book is definately my favourite out of all Richler's books. He uses his wonderful humour throughout the book. The main focus of this book is jokes. Richler has the reader laughing for the whole book. You should definately read this book!
3,"Fun to read, however borders on homophobic.","The novel is definitely funny. I had the strange luck to read it during my internship at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, which is where scenes of Joshua's infirm wife took place. Richler easily gets me to belly-laugh. BUT, part of his humor is based on homophobia. Joshua is mistaken for gay and his mother enthusiastically and misguidely marches with PFLAG. I think such humour is of the ""lowest common denominator"" variety. In this as in other books of his, Richler relies on gay people, or misidentified straight people for a cheap laugh, which I don't appreciate.The rest of the book is great and I recommend it."
2,*joshua then and now* S U C K S!!!!!!!,"this book is a most difficult read. it is almost like a history lesson. the whole idea of going back and forth from persent to past, made it a most trying excersise to read. if you are a casual reader from age 17 and lower; do not attempt to read this. this was the hardest, most boring and most challenging book i have yet to come across. read with caution and lots of time ahead of you."
4,Very Informitive,This book was very informitive and helpful in understanding what the average woman's body goes through after pregnancy. I was surprised that it takes so long to get back into shape after giving birth and according to this book there is no getting into shape a few months after. Its a waiting game - which I guess is a little disappointing but the truth helps.
2,Depressing and discouraging!,"I hated this book! I found the author's cutesy vocabulary and lighthearted ""oh well"" attitude in response to quite possibly never getting my body back to be nothing less than infuriating. Her description of waving a little white flag to 30 billion fat cells, and how they ""protect their precious goldmine of fat"" oblivious to months of exercise, and increasingly more stubborn with dieting, is obnoxious as it is frustrating.I felt that she was telling me certain goals are hopeless and that the only way to cope was to throw away my old clothes.I know that isn't true because (it was a tight fit), but I wore them home from the hospital! And I know I can improve from there.Don't listen to her! You can do it!I found that ""Lose Your Mummy Tummy"" was much more liberating, and will help me prepare for life and possible pregnancies down the road."
5,nice,Clean cut and work perfectly. We usually have a snack at night at our computers while gaming and use the long handles to stab the cheese from the plate and continue on
2,Disappointed in this product,I purchased a fondue pot that came with these forks plus I purchased an extra set of forks. Every single one of the forks looked like someone had bent them after the first use. I was very disappointed with this product.
4,Looks good,"They are good looking utensils, and after 1 dishwashing and pulling hard on the fork part, no sign of looseness. I think they are well made and a good deal."
5,Nice to have extra fondue forks.,I was having folks over for fondue and couldn't find my fondue forks. These were just fine. They were just the right length.
5,Great Writer !!,"Love her writing ! She is great. I was introduced to her story in a college class and once I read her first book, I want to read them all. She has a great skill for writing and the experience to know what to write..."
4,Zawinul..The hippest 70+ year old man on the planet,"Joe Zawinul can do no wrong. He connects the 1950's be-bop scene with tomorrow. I've been listening for years and am just now catching up to him. If you liked Weather Report, you'll like this CD. It's not quite as ""free"" as his live stuff, but the acuity with which Joe Z. pulls together many international flavors is remarkable. Fusion? This is it. The Zawinul Syndicate effortlessly fuses Jazz, Funk, Austrian folk (!) and high power rock and roll. Enjoy."
4,Global Citizen Joe,"If you start off by listening to the title track you get the purest distillation of what Joe's all about on this (& most other Zawinul Syndicate) album/s. An African rhythmic beat interwoven with a simple melodic synthesiser groove plus Joe's vocoder voice - grooving & soothing all at once! The opener ""Patriots"" in itself is really only a ""warm-up"" segue into ""South Africa"" - part protest song but mainly in celebratory mode for the liberation of Nelson Mandela & the black Soth African nation. Victims of the Groove & Afternoon showcase Joe's more embellished synthesiser effects (but always with that great, cooking underlying groove & never ""over the top""). Then take it down a notch with the gorgeous tone poem Night Clock & Rua Paula Freitas before heading into the flamenco-tinged ""San Sebastien"" & the gorgeous ""In a while, in a while"". Never jarring, always inventive - 4.5 stars & highly recommended!"
4,Too Small for Pelican Case - good for Backpack Zipper.,"good for what they are - keep your zippers on bags from coming open. Too small to use on Pelican Cases; only 2 keys like other reviewers noted; break this with a good pair of pliars; but it keeps hands out of your backpack, and keeps the zipper from coming open by mistake. NOT TSA locks so you'll have to risk TSA cutting them off if you use them on checked bags."
4,The Druid Renaissance,"An overall more or less complete overview of modern or neo-druidry. Multiple contributers keep this book fresh and new offering multiple view points rather than books written by a single author. Some authors in this book also appear in other publications, which makes Druidry a study spirituality rather than a read this do this type spirituality."
5,Everything I Wanted to Know About NASCAR.,"More than a collection of frilly pictures and personality profiles, NASCAR Chronicle tells the stories behind the men and the machines. An easy read, and lots of fun."
5,Songs of Inspiration,This is a beautiful CD filled with the wonderful songs of Kim Hill. One you never get tired of listening to.
5,Kim Hill - Arms of Mercy,The lyrics are doctrinal sound and inspirational. Highly recommended mp3. In an age where Christian music says nothing and means nothing Kim Hill is refreshing.
2,Not as nice as a Sky Chair,I'm returning this item because it is just not as nice as the Sky Chair brand we bought at an art & wine festival several years ago. The fabric smells toxic and the comfort/cut is just not right.
3,Don't Rely on it,"Obviously, this book is poorly organized and lack of proof-reading. You can always find duplicate materials in this book, in differnet chapters or even 2 pages after. You'd also find several errors in both content and practice questions; this slowed down my studying speed as I had to verify the material from the web whenever I had question. Don't rely on this book if you want to walk into the exam centre with confidence."
2,Major Critical Mistakes in book,"This book has major critical errors in it. It says maximum file length is 256 characters (it's 255), says that RegEdt32 is used on windows XP to edit the registry, it is in reality regedit. These are questions on the actual A+, and you will get them wrong reading this book. This is also the case for other books by Charles J Brooks, and his practice test cd on Exam Cram 2 (1000 questions, at least several with wrong answers). If it were not for these errors, he is an excellent author. However, you can not trust what he writes, as it may lead to a failed A+ Test. :("
3,slightly disappointed,"Well, I went looking for a decent book for A+ cert. This one seemed to be the biggest and ""most official"" that I could find.Right off, I noticed issues. First off, the editors were on a long nap. This shows more on the clarity of the material. Second, you WILL find at least one or two informational errors on every chapter, not counting typos. This was making me kind of worried, since, even though I am picking these errors out because this is mostly review, what am I missing?. My third complaint is on the review/tests. They are too redundant. The questions are asked so many times you just skip them out of annoyance. Some of the ""answers"" dont even answer the question properly. And some of the questions are not fully covered in the reading."
2,A LOT of the stuff on my A+ hardware exam was not in this book,"Before I took the test, I thought this book was ok, but after taking the A+ hardware exam last week and only barely passing, I have to say that a lot of the material on the exam were MISSING from this book."
2,The Rose of York Love & War,"I couldn't get into the book, therefore I deleted the story from my kindle and decided to find another story to read."
2,This book is no Phillipa Gregory that is for sure.,This read was a real disappointment. Very little research went into this. book. A great deal of sappy conjecture. Sappy Sappy!
3,Are we ever going to really know these characters?,"I felt like this was a bit of a ""textbook"" view of Richard III--just an overview of events without much in-depth characterization. I also felt that Worth was trying to be Sharon Kay Penman, and came up a bit short. The story moved along, but I never felt like I knew any of the characters--not even Richard. I'm spoiled by Penman's books, I suppose, where you end the book and feel like you're saying goodbye to a dear friend. I'm a Richard III fan, so I am interested in any books about him, and will read Worth's sequels, but I don't anticipate feeling like I'm living and breathing in the story like I do in truly great fiction. Recommended reading about Richard III--Sunne in Splendor (of course) and Josephine Tey's Daughter of Time, which Worth cites as her main influence."
5,Wonderful,I was excited to read this book once I read the description that it was a favorable account of Richard III. I personally liked it more than other popular Tudor books. This read less like a novel and made me think of it as more of a credible account.
4,Good book but a little slow in places,This was my first book on this type but it looked interesting. This was a good read there were just places that details of realtionships seemed to be really dragged out. The details were important to help keep up with the story line but I found myself skimming through part of it. Overall it was worth the read and I would recommend.
5,The Rose of York: Love & War,this was a great historical novel; full of romance as well as historical facts. I loved reading it and will read more like it.
4,Love and history!,The story of Richard and Anne was interesting and closer to being accurate than most. Well written and fast moving. Will read the next one.
2,No connection for me...,"Just ok...I never really felt connected to any character in this book. OK history lesson but I need to feel that connection to really like what I'm reading. twords the end I was excited for it to end so I could move on to other books I had waiting on my Kindle. Sorry, not for me."
2,Wordy,It's not what it seems. It's very wordy and not enough history to it. It's more about the sub characters than it is the king. I won't be getting the others in the series.
2,Straight up history lesson,"I enjoy reading historical fiction. This book was more like reading a history lesson - battle to battle - with a little dialoge thrown in. For me, the most interesting part of Richard III's life is what he accomplished with laws and helping the ""common man"" in his time. There is a little of this toward the end but the book doesn't really explain how he got to those ideals.Richard and Ann is a great love story. The images drawn in this book were too sugary sweet for my taste.If the reader is not familiar with the historical figures, and even if you are, it can be hard to follow all the characters since it jumps from scene to scene and will use titles, first and/or last names, and nicknames for the same character.Despite all of that, I am glad someone wrote a book that looks favorably on Richard III!"
4,Love &War,Well written - gives another view of Richard III. For those of us who love English history this book is a look at the people & battles of Richard's life before he was king. Very good read!
4,Will the circle be unbroken,"This is a pretty good collection of country songs from the Columbia Records vaults, dating from the late 1960s to the 1980s. There are some great songs here, and there are some not-so-great songs here. That is to say, a few of them are not to my taste. But it is still a good representation of country music from the time period covered."
5,Thoughts Of Heaven by the Rochesters,Absolutely some of the best bluegrass gospel music you will hear!! They have several albums out and all are them are great. I highly recommend this album and this group!!
4,a great book on memory,great book! it has helped me to improve my memory and improve scores on tests. it has also helped me to remember peoples names and faces more easily. highly recomended for any one out there that thinks they have a poor memory
1,Don't buy,I read some negative reviews about this product but didn't listen. I have a long commute daily and seeing clearly in the nasty winter months is vital. So I purchased what I thought would be a good investment but they did nothing but cause streaking and decreased my overall visibility. After first use I thought there was some sort of film on the blades and the windshield to remove any residue so I thoroughly cleaned thinking this would improve the wiping action. I was wrong yet again. Streaking did not improve but actually got worse.I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if the blades are defective but my experience was not a good one and lost my money on this deal.
3,Cheap installation clip,"They make this blade usable on several different types of wiper arms, so (in my case) I needed to attach the enclosed clip to the blade before attaching to my wiper arm. The clip is made of very cheap plastic and, although I did manage to get the blade on the arm securely (hopefully...time will tell), the tab for releasing the blade and removing it from the arm cracked off during the installation. No idea how I'll remove it when these blade wear out, but I'll have to deal with that when the time comes. Very unimpressive for a company like Trico."
5,"Impeccably researched, and full of spirit!","There isn't much to add that hasn't already been well said by previous reviewers. The author does an excellent job of capturing the personality and interaction of the main characters. He puts forth an excellent plot based on an interesting conjecture on the fate of the mythical 'Lost Gold of the Confederacy'. He captures the essence of both a forgotten society and the current society of lost values.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and highly recommend it to anyone who likes a riveting read."
4,Hill's poems give voice to human longing,The reason I loved this book is the plain language used to express what the heart wants. Her poems are about people wanting and needing love but not being apolagetic about it. Sort of how lonely people explaIn their passions.
5,ideal for face/neck & shoulders/breasts,"The complexion brush is much softer than Dr. Jenson's body brush and is useful for brushing sensitive areas of the skin. I like a good scratch with my body brush but I can imagine that some people with skin issues would prefer to just use the complexion brush as a full-body brush, as long as you can stand taking your time with the smaller size. (remember to use caution & brush around broken skin)"
3,"Well written, but contains some misinformation","This book is well written and does a good job of covering SF Bay Area backpacking trails. However, while reading the sections on hikes I am intimately familiar with, I find some misinformation. For example, Camp Herbert on the Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail has been closed for well over a decade, but sadly, it is discussed as if it were still open for trail camping. So be sure to make some phone calls and check out the facts before you commit to a backpacking trip from this book; it could save you much frustration. This is still a good addition to any hiking library, unfortunately, you'll need to double check it."
3,so-so,"A pretty good security cable, I guess. It looks and feels rugged, but that coily characteristic. In one application, I had to ""uncoil"" the cord to make it just fit around a cement column. One end got away and wacked my eyeglasses off. So, be careful when using them. Next time, I'll get non-coiled cables."
3,Missing Roots...,"Songs are good but the sound quality leaves much to be desired as another reviewer said which is why I docked it one star. I also didn't like the different verse on Walkin Through The Country. Finally there seems to be a track missing. Back of box lists 12 tracks, on CD there is 11. Missing is Hold On To What You Got. Sheesh I pay 18 bucks for this disc and I dont even get the whole album!"
5,Don't wait a million years to buy this one!,"I've got a well preserved vinyl copy and I jumped at the chance to get a limited edition remastered CD of what I think my be the best Grass Roots album ever. So far I've listened to it through Sennheiser headphones off a computer CD drive and I'm just blown away by the sound quality.Every tune on this album is great listening. One of the ""non hits"" sort of reminds me of The Doors, and another of The Grateful Dead, but it's all 1960's rock heaven.The true highlights are:First, the full length version of ""Walking Through the Country"" which I've heard many times, but there seems to be an ""extra verse"" or two on this album. A great tune!And best of all, the original version of ""Wait a Million Years"" with the haunting keyboard intro that got cut off the end on the version that got played on the radio back in those days.Anyway, this was a pricey one as CD's go these days, but I'll bet a nickel to a buck it'll be a lot more after it's sold out!"
4,great cheap macro solution,"I bought this extension tube to use my Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM lens for macro shots on my 5D. The build quality was a little plasticy but it worked fine and seemed like a good value for occasional use relative to the more expensive Canon version. Keep in mind that an extension tube greatly limits the focus range of the lens. My 85mm could only focus from about 2"" in front of the lens to about 18"". This means you have a very narrow working focal range and have to remove the extension tube to take pictures of things farther away. This is a great way to add macro capability to an existing lens on the cheap. However, nothing beats a dedicated macro lens. [...]."
1,"Not Belkin, Not appropriate for teleco racks, Total Rip-off","Long story short, these are not Belkin rack screws as the deceptive seller would lead you to believe. They are some off-brand self-tapping machine screw that will strip your rack screw holes quite easily. Do not buy. Rip-off."
5,"The ""Four Seasons of Entrepreneurship"" ... in a nutshell !","I think Mr. Chan has hit the nail on the head with this book.I am a coporate executive who has been thinking about going independent for some time. Without exaggerating, I think this book really pushed me over the edge in terms of my decision to start my own business.Mr. Chan is an absolute realist. He takes one through what I call the ""four seasons of entrepreneurship"" (fear, hope, confidence, uncertainty) with great skill. He openly shares his wisdom and concrete examples from 20 years of his own experience as an entrepreneur. He will take away all your illusions but gives you great reason to be hopeful as well. I would summarize by saying that this book gave me two things: inspiration and confidence to know that I can succeed. I highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to start a business.Tim RyanLucerne, Switzerland"
5,"The new ""Gold Standard"" resource on professional indepence","During my 2002 summer quest to relax and spend more time with family, I've rediscovered my passion for reading. (Real books. Made of paper. No LCD screen attached. What a novel idea...)Spare Room Tycoon was one of the first books I picked up.Simply put, I just can't say enough great things about this book.While many people praise similar books on the subject of entrepreneurial independence, Spare Room Tycoon is by far a more thoughtful, honest, true-to-yourself account of what it is to be a solo entrepreneur or to run a MicroEnterprise.If you're a Free Agent or have entrepreneurial aspirations of any kind, you *have* to read this book."
1,Not Worthwhile.,The book recites generalities and platitudes. It states the obvious. The examples given are not particularly enlightening or useful. It does not provide any practical advice or instruction. The book is mostly philosophizing.
4,Truly Inspirational,"Mr. Chan's ""Spare Room Tycoon"" isn't a typical ""How To..."" book with a blueprint for success but rather a book that shares the trials and tribulations of those many people who have drive and desire to be the captains of their own destiny. Mr. Chan tells the true life stories of many individuals who ride out the rough waters of the business world to either sink or swim with their ideas, their dreams, their hopes. Real life situations--some heartwarming; some heartbreaking, but all inspirational. I can tell you from personal experience that Mr. Chan is right on target with his interviews because my son's story is part of this wonderful book."
4,Helped keep me focused and positive,"I very much enjoyed reading ""Spare Room Tycoon.""I've this year left my full-time work at an international publishing company to start my own writing, editing and training company - and am enjoying the new-found burst of creativity the change has brought.""Spare Room Tycoon"" has helped to keep me focused and feeling positive - and not alone in my quest to find a better quality of life rather than just money.I've recommended the book to a former colleague who is planning an escape to her own spare room soon in order to - like me - more fully enjoy her creative life.Gregg SchroederHong Kong"
5,Cardinal,"Dr. James Chan's book, SPARE ROOM TYCOON, is different than the usual type of business book. It is motivational in that it tells, and prepares the reader for, the psychological aspects of owning your own business. The efforts and the rewards involved in being an entrepreneur are presented in Dr. Chan's own story and in several stories of other ""Spare Room Tycoons"". I felt as if the author were in front of me telling me the stories instead of me reading words from a book. I recommend this to those contemplating starting their own business and to those already established on their own."
2,very uncomfortable,"I bought this in white thinking it would blend better under clothing - you can not wear this under clothing. It chafes horribly and my shoulders and underarms are covered in angry red marks. If you wear it over your clothes, it's much more comfortable, but you look like a mental patient. Maybe I would have looked less awful if I'd gotten in it black...It seems to do what it advertises - it does keep my shoulders back. But the velcro and straps are too uncomfortable to wear. Maybe I'll try it over a blouse, and a jacket over that... you'll still see the front strap though. Can't win here!"
5,Excellent--going his own way works,"There are already quite a few great recordings of Bartok's masterpiece, the Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta, fewer of the Divertimento, a masterpiece written on a smaller, simpler scale (but still thorny if you expect ""divertimento"" to connote Mozartean vivacity and charm). I own completely satisfying readings of the MFSPC by Reiner, Bernstein, and Levine. But Harnoncourt has carved out a special place beside these greats.He takes very slow tempi in every movement compared to Reiner, but especially in the first--9:10 for Harnoncourt, 7:00 for Reiner. The effect of this slowing down is mesmerizing; you are forced to listen to the inner working of Bartok's complex rhythms as never before. Baartok was wriing is own version of counterpoint, and here his peculiar genius emerges with great freshness and freedom. The orchestra plays beautifully for him, and the sound from RCA/BMG is splendid.I think this is a great addition to the Bartok catalog. Five stars."
4,Wonderful Bartok,"An absolutely fabulous piece of music with which I was not previously familiar. Having never heard it before, it is difficult for me to compare this version with others, but my temptation is to label it as just a bit stiff in execution. This is a minor quibble, though, as overall Harnoncourt's conducting is flawless and measured. I highly recommend this recording."
4,"Neat, funny surprise package!!","Funny, dry humor at it's best .. .. It's not always necessary to say something when just a look will do .. ..Heart-warming tale of an Egyptian Police Band stuck in a small Israeli town due to a misunderstanding anyone can make .. ..And, sometimes just a wave says more than years of worthless bable .. .. =)))"
5,Little gem steeped in subtelty and melancholy,"One of the most humane and psychologically nuanced films I have seen in years. I don't think the director had ever intended this rather short (and probably low budget) film to be a revelation. But it certainly is... at least, it was for this reviewer. The melancholy wind-swept landscape of an Israeli ""middle of nowhere"" (if such a thing can exist in tiny Israel) serves as a backdrop to the travails of a hapless band of Egyptian police musicians lost on a tour of Israel. Their chance encounters with residents of a desert Israeli town provide us with a low key but profound examination of human vulnerabilities, of the tenderness of our inner souls. And that Dina... Simply superb!"
4,THE BAND'S VISIT-review,"It was an interesting off-beat sort of show. It wasn't riveting, but it held my attention. The transaction via the seller was totally satisfactory. The actual delivery time beat the anticipated time. So f/me, a completely 100% job!"
5,The Empire 5 Star 500 - #48,What would it take to brighten up your darkest day? Human dramedy with a heart. Police band comes to town and ends up getting lost. In the process of adjusting their sails to the proper destination they meet some interesting characters. Anyone that has lived should be able to relate to this film. There are some awkward situations that are funny and some funny situations that are awkward. The band charges forward and makes it to their concert. They are essentially smarter men because of the detour. I do honestly recommend this - it is a pleasant film that will make you think for the day.
4,I loved this movie!,"We somehow found this movie and when we started it, we were not sure that it was worth watching to the end. The plot is simple and as an Egyptian, I sympathized with both Israelis as well as Egyptians. The actors mostly used correct Egyptian dialect, which probably made me the more accepting of its plot.I have to say that 15 minutes into the movie, my husband and I were completely taken by it. By the end of the movie, I was homesick LOL It is a wonderful movie and it makes us rethink the differences politics is forcing us to make up of one another. Really touching."
3,inadequate subtitles,"Seller was quick and efficient.The film was the problem. One can still understand the story, but the subtitles don't add much to understanding. They stop mid idea and leave it to the viewer to fill in the blanks. Luckily, the language moves more toward English as the film progresses. A sweet story."
4,Different from what I expected,"This movie was different from what I expected. I thought it would be faster-paced; a little bit on the edge, perhaps a little controversial. It was none of these. Instead, ""The Band's Visit"" is a quiet movie, made great by terrific acting, both by the Israelis and by the Arabs. Each part was played to understated perfection. I also liked the way the director cast very ordinary looking people, some with less than great teeth or bodies, to be the stars of the movie. In addition, the people in this film seem weighted down by boredom, loneliness or both- just like in real life! But moments of real insight do occur, which make the movie touching and worthwhile. Watch this movie when you are in a reflective mood, and enjoy!"
2,As disappointing as the nothing town it features,"I usually love quiet, quirky films about people living out their ordinary lives. Generally because the characters evolve through some kind of minor crisis and discover hidden strengths or have a moment of revelation and change. This film promised to be just such a movie, and with my interest in the region, I looked forward to watching it.The slow pace of the film was appealing, but the lack of any kind of redemption in the characters wasn't. Everyone acted just as you expected they would... there wasn't even any political or social commentary (unless the producer wants to point out that Israeli women are either harpies or sluts) there were no surprises and therefore no redemption in this film and I was very disappointed.Sure, it's realistic, too much so. I threw it out."
2,Bit over sold,Publicity I feel oversold the film. Nice bits and soft bits but I felt not as riviting as I had expected
1,"this film had potential for greatness, but editor was asleep","let me give you the positives first, because the movie is worth one star. the characters are real and normal,quirky and weird, and at times funny like the rest of us in the world. also they have egos to feed. this is not uncommon.the problem I have with the film is the very awkward, uncomfortable, even gross sex scene toward the end of the film. if that one scene was edited out this would be a 3.5 -4 star movie. the scene was that bad. that one gross sex scene ruins the whole film, just like a wine that has turned to vinegar ruins an entire meal."
4,I liked it...,I really enjoyed this movie. My family hated it. I thought it was quirky and fun and a pleasure to go along for the ride. The different personalities of the band members and the small townspeople were universally recognizable. Very human. I really liked it. Not for everyone.
4,Great Manga!,"This is a really really great manga! Cute drawings, funny unforgetable characters, and at the same time... a dark serious story. This story so far will make you laugh and make you sad. It's really great and i recomend it! Misha is a darling, and Shia is super cute. Drawings are super cute! I love their outfits. Buy it, you wont regret it!"
1,Poorly constructed locks,1 of the 4 never worked and the others are difficult to lock as they pop open. Never had this before with a lock.
3,Kinda Small,"Guess I did not realize that they were quite so small but I should have had a clue by the description, showing 3/4""."
3,Smaller than it looks,If your lookings for a lock that will secure your luggage then this is the right product for you. The locks are smaller than they look so its not feasable to use them for anything else.
1,bad experience,I was expecting bigger locks and the picture on my computer scree was bigger than the actual locks themselves. I was very dissapointed. Then Amazom whom I've never had any trouble with gave me a rough time about shipping the items back. This was my fist bad experience with them...
1,Poor Design and more,"After taking about 1 hour to figure out how to set the clock + timer for the 20 programs - only to find that if you unplug the unit from the wall, you lose all your settings! So if your mains supply goes off, this product will stop working. The design quality to hold to the batteries at the back is poor. You have to fiddle with it for some time ... very painful."
4,Once you get the hang of programming.....,"Having given up on the junky timers at Home Depot and Lowe's I saw this one from Smart Home, a company whose product line is pretty good, on Amazon.After misprogramming this unit, I finally re-read the instructions and got it working. The remote is really good for emergencies - excellent product - ordering extra units"
3,Reason for price drop?,"I think I know why the price of these timers has dropped to $20.99. I purchased two of these units, and all ofthe batteries in the wall units and the remote controls had leaked, were covered with a light layer of corrosionand were down slightly on voltage ( 1.35 - 1.4v vs 1.5 vdc ). I contacted Smarthome to ask for a partial refund,or for them to send replacement batteries, but their response only gave me the choice of an exchange( so I'd send back units with corroded batteries and get more units with corroded batteries, brilliant solution! )or nothing. Even with the bad batteries the units worked fine as remote control switches, so if you're stillinterested in these ( I wouldn't be ), add the cost of four AG13 button cells to the price."
3,only comes with 2 keys,What you see is not what you get (false advertising!) only two keys are included instead of the four shown in the picture. When are manufacturers going to catch on that cheaping out saves pennies now and costs sales later when disgruntled (formerly loyal) customers find another brand? As far as security goes I have had good luck with this type of master lock over the years.
3,Good for around the house low security needs,There are not a lot of pins on the pin tumbler so don't use this for securing expensive items. Also the shank isn't very deep making it somewhat hard to use on some gym lockers.
2,Description incorrect,"For the most part this is as described, but this item does not come with 4 keys. It only has 2. Please correct this in the image."
3,Good for the money,"My only complaint is that one of the sunction cups was bent and deformed from packaging. Therefore, no suction will hold it to the rear window glass. The top two cups hold just fine while the cover rests on the parcel shelf. Works for me. Obviously, the cover may add a little difficulty to seeing darkend areas and during nightime."
5,Less stress,This was one of the best stress reducing CD's I have ever heard. John Martin's voice is so peaceful that I often think about it when I am under stress and it takes care of my stress. Good job John!
2,Irritating voice,"This CD contains few ""waves"" so if you wanted to hear the ocean this is not the CD for you. Also, the author's voice is not soothing but irritating. His messages are good - he should have hired someone else to do the speaking."
5,book order #1,My ordering experience was flawless AND quick !!The book I received was in fantastic shape and it came VERY quicklyThank you
4,A straight forward adventure...with turns,"I just got done reading this with my 7 year old daughter. We both enjoyed it quite a bit. I thought the first few chapters were a little slow, but once the Fire Pirates came on the scene, things picked up quite a bit. Then, a little more than half way through the book, all heck broke loose with lots of unexpected plot twists and thrilling, fast-paced events that made us keep reading ""just one more chapter"".I would recommend this as a great book to read to your 7-9 year old. The only real complaint was that my daughter was very annoyed that there was a big picture of a dragon on the cover, but no hint of one ever appeared in the story. (What's up with that?)"
3,The Floating Island,"This novel started out good with pirates, mermaids, and an adventurous main character, but didn't get much more fantastic than that. I expected dragons, danger and drama, the main character is in jail after all, but I got a haunted orphan house. Most of the novel is set in an inn that houses orphans, and it wasn't very enjoyable to me. I would love to continue the series to see Ven travel around the world seeing wonderful things, but I honestly expected that in this novel and didn't get it. The Floating Island is enjoyable and fun, but it could have been even more enjoyable, fun, and fantastic. A good start to a series which can only get better."
3,Just all right,"I did enjoy the action in this novel, but the characters weren't compelling enough for me to care dearly about them. The only thing I found truly *real* were Ven's feelings for his family, and they were relegated to far away, long ago for too much of the story.Ven himself seemed to morph too much to seem a real character. I felt like she didn't have a good handle on him, so I didn't either."
5,Best series I've had the pleasure to read,"Honestly, it's been several years since I've read these books, and while Harry Potter, Perseus Jackson, Eragon, Hunger Games and many others entertained us in between, it's Haydon's writing and enthralling stories that captured my heart. We get as many books from the library as we can, but I'm on line to buy this series for my 8 year old, 12 year old, who I first enjoyed them with, and for me. There's humor, suspense and even after all thIs time has gone by, Ven feels like family I want to reconnect with."
3,Leica's compact 8 X 20 isn't close to the competition's,"This is an old, time-tested design from Leica, but one which isn't nearly as robust or as bright as some of its competition, most notably, Swarovski, and especially, Zeiss. I have handled this binocular and found that it isn't nearly as bright as my Zeiss Victory Compact 8 x 20, nor is it as rugged. Ideally, this Leica binocular works best as a glorified concert opera glass, yet it lacks the brightness and contrast I've seen in its Zeiss competitor. If you are eager to acquire a binocular in this class, I would recommend taking a closer look at both the Swarovski and Zeiss equivalents, before setting your sights on this Leica compact."
2,Overpriced for less than stellar quality,"Ordered the Leica along with a Minox BV 8X25. The latter - at half the price - offers comparable optical quality with far better ergonomics, fit and finish. The focusing knob on the Leica felt cheap and imprecise. Summary: You don't always get what you pay for."
3,music,"A bit more ""country"" than I care for-but otherwise ok- At least I was able to ""listen & learn"" - without ""pain and/or discomfort!"
2,Four Freshment Live at Butler U.,I love the Four Freshmen and own much of their vinyl and CD's. This is the only disappointing recording I know of from the Freshmen. Something just didn't click with the Kenton Band here. The arrangements seem somewhat out of style with the Freshman sound and I guess there was just not enough rehearsal before hand.
2,Great names - disappointing results.,"Stan Kenton and Four Freshmen are among the best in music of their time.I am a big fan of both them, so very reluctantly I have to admit my disappointment. Unfortunately, this concert does not live-up to their reputation. A lot of talk, which may be entertainig in concert itself, but in CD, it is a great waste of time ! And in those few minutes of actual music - none of their great songs . A pity!Personaly I think , it does not give you a good value for your money. Listen to the samples - you will get the idea."
5,The REAL Washington,"I was 14 and living in the District of Columbia when President Nixon resigned, and I was 17 when this mini-series was first broadcast. As I watched it, Watergate and Nixon's behavior all made sense. I am very happy to see this mini-series finally available on DVD, as it was never re-broadcast. I can remember my high school classmates and I trying to guess which character in the mini-series was playing a real-life Watergate person, and also trying to get our civics teacher to give us the ""rest of the story"" when he was explaining the Constitutional checks and balances of our government. Ah, Mr. Cummings, you just couldn't compete with Washington: Behind Closed Doors!"
3,Tex,"Tex was a great book. It was a book about a young boy named Tex. He lived a hard life. As he got older he started making wrong choices, and getting into trouble. I would strongly recomend this book to other students. I think they would find it an interesting and touching story."
2,Great litarateure,"This was a fine piece of litarature. Susan Hinton wrote a well developed story much better than That Was Then This Is Now, i recomend reading the prior books esspecialy THE OUTSIDERS, THAT WAS THEN THIS IS NOW, reading these two books first will help you to get the deeper meaning of the book. the best part of the book was the allusions allthe books relate to eachother find the allusions and it will be even better of a book."
4,Tex,"The book Tex, by S.E. Hinton is a very good book. The events in the book are incredibly exciting. For example, when Mason hits his brother for going off and trying to find his horse after he sold it. The book is also very meaningful. I can really relate to many parts of the book, like when Tex gets hit for looking for his horse. Another exciting part is when Tex rides his friend's motorcycle. I think Tex's main problem is that Mason and he are so different. For example, Mason is good at school things and Tex isn't good at that kind of stuff. They act different and want different things out of life like Mason wants to go to college and Tex wants to stay in town. I think that Mason is more of the man in the family. With his dad always away at the rodeo he, must take control of the household. His little brother Tex doesn't understand that which makes the plot more complicated. Overall, I think the book is very exciting, and I would recommend it to anyone."
2,It was a simple and uninteresting book.,"""Tex"" is mainly about a boy life growing up, it is a simple story with simple writing. I like the fact that it was simple reading but the story did not have much interest to me. It talks about Tex, a young boy, growing up alone with his brother because their father abandone them. It shows the conflict and love between two brothers. Personally, I don't like reading this book because it gets some what boring. I didn't really care for the main character so I did not get into the book. There was a plot but it did not seem to be what I am looking for. I would not recommend this book because it is simply too boring to read."
3,"Drinking, smoking, drugs, sex, dating, shopliftting, hitch h","Drinking, smoking, drugs, sex, dating, shopliffting, hitch hikking is what is in this paperback book which is intended for 14 year olds? I like the way S.E. Hinton wrote this book the way the adolesent characters would speak but the genres covered in this book is not appropriate for people in junior high. Shame on you teachers who let your junior high students read this material. Won't somebody please think of the children!!!Overall this book is satisfactory but unfortunatley it only interests 15-16 year olds because any younger and it's innapropriate, and any older and it's just plain boring!!"
5,Better with each successive read.,"I've re-read ""Tex"" and the symbolism and story line have both deepened and made even more sense to me because of it. This is a great read for anyone living in the suburbs or city. A great escape tp the country for a short while."
4,exstrodanary,"Tex is a exstrodanary book. Ive read many of books by S.E. Hinton. This is one of the best ones ive read(besides outsiders). Once you pick up this book you can't put it down!! This book tells alot about what some famileys are like, and whats happening in other towns. I live out in the country and its alot like tex says about the differnces about city and country life. Of all things, why would u want to sell drugs to have money for your babey?? Sell other stuf besides drugs. SO DONT BE LIKE LEM!!!"
1,watching grass grow is more fun,"Tex is about a young man and his brother. They get into trouble but also find their way out. Tex , the name of the main charter , has a dad but he doesn't live with him. Tex's dad doesn't always come down to visit and Tex holds that against him. Tex has a friend named Johnny and they like to hang out together. Tex has problems with his friends, with his foes, and sometimes with the law. One of the reasons that I didn't really like this book was that that it doesn't live up to The Outsiders a book also by S.E Hinton. This book did not have enough adventure in it. I was expecting something very good and adventurous from S.E Hinton but this book just isn't. I didn't connect with Tex because he's not really adventurous like me. He likes to ride horses and I really do not. If he was more adventurous and liked to get inn to trouble then maybe I would like the book a little bit more."
5,A VERY GOOD BOOK TO READ,"The book Tex is a very good book and I would give it five stars. The book was writen by a man with the name of S.E. Hinton. The book started out with the two brothers Tex and Mason and a mom and a dad, then their mom died of . While the two boys suffered their mom's death the dad moved off to do rodeo and that is when things started to fall apart and to find out read the book. The one person that I would recomend this book to would be someone who read his other books."
3,It's a very good book.,I think that the story is very good. Tex has a lot stuff to overcome. Tex has an older brother that bosses him around and he finally finds out why he always acts more like a father than his real one. I liked the story a lot it was pretty easy to read but it's a story we all should read. I would read this book if you like books like The Outsiders.
1,don't read this book it's dumb,this book is about a boy who had to grow up fast becaus his dad left before he was born and when his drifter dad decieds to come home it may change his life for ever.
5,Not that big!,"This is a great watch, and the reviewer that said it was too big for his wrist has to be exaggerating excessively. My wrist is only 6 3/4 in. and with 3 links removed it fits accross my wrist perfectly. Also, another reviewer said it was difficult to see unless under light - it's designed that way so in bright sunlight, it's very easy to read (remember, it was designed by a surfer). Overall this is a fantastic watch for the price....I may buy another!"
3,interesting,"seen this done on modeling sites like model mayhem..so it was interesting to see different slides projected. But if you just looking to see the models, lots of slides are dark..The first model also like to keep the lower region covered with sheer robe,lol.. 3 models total and hundreds of pics..much easier and cheaper than bodypaint"
2,Shiny,"I think I was distracted by the bright sparkling blade of this knife when I put it in my cart. This is a pretty low grade ""stainless steel"" and is very very light by weight. The tang is almost full, but not quite to the end of the handle, and not quite the entire width of the handle either - likely just enough to contact the rivets. Don't have very high hopes for sharpening in the future. As always with knives, you get what you pay for."
3,"Nice, but I expected a little more...","A nice collection, but this time only 12 artists...??!!??Out of which 3 or 4 (I don't remember exactely...) are music videos!!!I expected all of them being live performances...But it still sounds nice!!"
3,WOW 2006,I felt I was cheated out of songs on this DVD. It had about 4 less songs on it than any of the other albums have.
2,Tragically self-indulgent writing style,"This books is chock full of fascinating ideas. So chock full, that at times it loses direction. The author is so in love with the ideas, he has a little trouble following one coherently at times. This tendency is exacerbated by the authors injudicious use of parenthetical phrases (where he suddenly goes in a new direction). The book is larded, weighted down, and crippled by these parenthetical phrases - after a while I just wanted to scream for him to get an editor. GET AN EDITOR! But of course, this book was written quite a while ago. Of course some of the parenthetical phrases are fine. Many others reflect the authors inability to commit to a direction, his incapability to abandon any direction related to his main point. This is catastrophically frustrating because the ideas are so fascinating. Alas, he has trouble making his point clearly. Tragic."
1,One of the Worst,"I love retelling, my love of them was started by Robin Mckinly's Beauty. This book is horrible! I couldn't follow the dialog, and half the time the characters were interrupting each other with pointed stuff that didn't have anything to do with the story. It was such a short story that I expected it to be simple and straight to the point, but no! It kept taking all these pointless tours through territory that was boring, time consuming, and hard to follow. I will never read another book by this author again. Please don't waste your time."
3,Fairytale lacking conflict....,"I love reading retelling of fairytales...but this was all 'tell' and very little 'show'. It was a cute story, if you don't have anything better to read. I kept waiting for some sort of climax or real conflict, but the climax was more of a molehill rather than a mountain."
2,Frustration,"This book is not organized logically and provides an inappropriate level of detail in some areas while offering only very basic information in others. As a novice teacher, I find it frustrating. The section and chapter review questions are also too ambiguous. Students have a hard time determining what exactly questions are asking. I am frustrated by this book. It doesn't work for me or my ninth grade students. I give it two stars because I DO like the writing excercises and ""Biology in Progress"" sections."
2,Modern Biology,"I am a biology teacher and I have advanced degrees in Biochemistry. I really dislike the textbook ""Modern Biology"" by Towle. In my experience some topics are placed in the least opportune places. Thus while the topic of redox reactions is introduced in Chapter 2, there is no real tie-in to anything else until Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration in later chapters. I would prefer leaving the explanation of Redox until Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration are discussed. Similarly, the topic of enzymes and catalysis are brought up before the student is introduced to proteins. I just don't see the logic with which topics are organized."
3,Learned A lot--But Hated Learning,"This book really goes in depth in information on all aspects of Biology. However, as a student, I have found that it is extremely difficult to learn from without the direct aid from a biologist or teacher. The vocabulary is over extravagent for a teaching book, and the section review questions badly organized and tiresome. The pictures and diagrams did help me to learn a lot however, because it combined visual along with analytic learning. Overall, I have learned a lot, but had a hard time learning it. And I may well forget this within a few weeks."
1,was a rip off,"I got this product as a gift. The volume button was broken and the magnet on it fell off. The company did not want to replace it unless I paid more shipping on it, on top of the shipping I paid for already. They were hard to reach. They would not answer their phone and only emailed me back at night and a day later. They were and the product was a complete waste of my time!"
4,glad I got it,"I just bought it off of AMazon a week ago (which is the lowest price for the full version I have been able to find so far) and IM glad I did. For new people to the software, you may wanna stay with your older version for a bit and just get used to it before shelling out the money, but if your serious about design and making your workflow work to the max for you, this new collection is a must. Tight integration and the help of the version Cue additional file managment software will help even the messiest designer keep thier files inline. If design is what you want to do, then theres no better package to get. Ive been using Photoshop for years and Illustrator and Indesign for a while now and this is defenitly an inovation in design.I gave it 4 stars due to small problems I had installing the whole suite at once. I have never had the problem with anything else and it was frustrating. But after that its smooth saling."
5,great reference,work ICU & PACU areas and this is a great reference book for quick look up of medication calculations and drug compatibility
2,just an outline,"This book is more like an outline of how ICU documentation should be done as compared to managing ICU conditions. im sure its good for that, but i needed an icu book that was more case based."
4,Beautiful Doll,"Beautiful doll, my girls will hopefully enjoy this doll for a long time. Well made, cute accessories, very pretty doll with gorgeous hair that the girls can brush,"
4,Park Power review,"Product is working well, much easier to handle than the 50 amp cord. Delivery was as promised."
4,Higher Expectations?,"4 Stars vs. 5 . . . The cord works as intended, but it is pricy compared to standard 30 amp RV cords. It does allow for convenient hook-up to 30 amp outlets with an RV having a 50 shore power inlet. I suppose if someone stole your ($200) 50 amp cord and 30 amp adapter, the price wouldn't be as big of an issue.I expected a bit higher quality and heft to the cord for the price. Overall I am OK with the purchase."
1,KP,"I bought this to fight frizz. I am not happy with it. It says to put it on when hair is damp. I've tried wet, damp, and dry and I've never had satisfactory results. The frizz comes back within a half hour or so."
5,Recommended for allergies,"this is one of the few hair products I can use because of allergies... but it is a very good product, easy to use and giving body to hair and keeping it from being dry and fly'away"
2,You get what you pay for (version 2.0),"This is the second time I've written this review as the first one was removed for some reason.The earrings did not have near the luster of the ""stock photo"" that is shown on Amazon. I have added two pictures of them to show you what they looked like. The pearls seems more like plastic beads or some sort of costume jewelry rather than something that would make you think ""pearl"".Everything was ""cheap"" about the earrings from the actual price of them to the packaging of them.I know this review probably seems overly harsh given the price of the items, but I was severely disappointed in the purchase as I felt it was a complete waste of money. The only reason I did not give this one star is because the price being as low as it is I guess I should have known better."
5,A great holiday toy,I got this car for my sons last year and it is very cute - it plays an instrumental excerpt of the hot chocolate song and the sound is pretty good for a toy. The only thing is it doesn't have the strongest magnet on it to connect to other train cars but I have found that with most of the Brio trains. Otherwise it is a great toy/gift.
3,What ah Shame,"I'm not quite familiar with the whole record company ting, but they could have included atleast one sizzla tune in dey. Sizzla has released 3 albums that I know of in 2003. Anyways Bless"
4,I Like this CD !! 2 CDS for the price of 1,"I think that this cd is great, full of popular songs of reggae, plus they give us a second cd with remixes of some songs of the original cd. I recommend it for the fans of reggae!"
3,Amusing!,"An amusing story of Harvard & Radcliffe students set in Cambridge, Mass in the late 1950s. Caused quite a stir around Harvard Square when it first came out. Cleverly constructed and, yes, superficial, but fun for the way it captures the spirit of its era. It's alleged that many of the characters were based on actual people...some of whom went on to distinguished careers. As for the author, ""Leonie St. John"" was a pen-name used by a male-female couple each of whom has since gone on separately to write far better books!"
4,reliable and cheap for low security applications,"The technical details for this lock say, ""4 pin cylinder helps prevent picking."" There is nothing about this lock that helps prevent picking. In the sport lock picking community the Master No. 3 is a popular 1st lock to learn lock picking with because of the ease in which it can be picked."
4,Just what I expected,This was just what I expected. It was perfect for the paper I had to write. It described what I needed to know.
4,"A Very Good Book, with wide coverage","This is a very useful book. It covers all the credit risk pricing theories. It is much more complete than anything else on the market today and includes very recent models too. I found the chapters on structural models (the one on financial engineering) and reduced form models particularly helpful. This is difficult matter to understand and the book is quite clear (and stresses the limits of the different models well). Some interesting theoretical extensions are useful too. Some chapters were a bit less good (swap credit risk) and some elements are missing (sovereign risk) but overall it is very good. With the BIS rules coming up, I think this type of book should become required reading. (and it shows the strong limitations of the current models used in practice today). Has no competitor on the market in my mind."
2,A bird's-eye view of credit risk,"An almost complete and in-depth list of credit risk models. Could be a nice resource for those who are new to the field, or who specialize in one area of credit risk management and wish to broaden their view, or even for veteran quants who wish to stay current of the latest development and industry trend. However, as is true to any book in its first print, beware of the numerous typos."
2,"Interesting, but full of errors","The recent developments in credit-risk analysis have been highly quantitative and theoretical. Hugues Pirotte & Didier Cossin provide a comprehensive overview of the most popular credit risk models. Their purpose is to allow practitioners to apply quantitative modeling to this complex area. I think that it is a quite good book: easy to read, clear for most of its explanations but I found too many mistakes in mathematical formulas. The editor could have been more careful with the reader's comfort. On the downside: the chapter on swap credit risk (a model from the authors) is so pretentious that it becomes very irritating and actually damages the quality of the book. In addition, no disk with source code!"
5,Uplifting,For the true believer -- especially those who started their walk many years ago -- this is a collection that will lift your spirit.
5,Awesome!,"Awesome! For many years my husband and I have loved listening to Tennessee Ernie Ford, and we certainly are not disappointed with this collection. It is difficult to find these old hymns and, much more so, to hear them performed as only this man did."
4,Love the old Gospel songs,"Have been looking for some of these CD's for awhile am glad that now I have found where to buy them, Have been converting old LP's to cd now I have found them on CD allready Thanks"
1,What a disappointment!,"If you're a diehard TEF fan, maybe you can stand this CD; but if you're looking for a good selection of old standard hymns, save your money. The sound quality is poor, the arrangements are terrible, and the beautiful hymns are done a real disservice by the treatment here. This is not the TEF I remember from growing up; maybe some of his other CDs have better treatment of hymns, but this CD is terrible."
1,Tennessee Ernie Ford Amazing Grace cassette two,"No stars at all...This tape Stinks...very baaad.The backup singers ruin this tape.Ralphael, the OLD one"
3,great clit stimulator,"the rotating didn't do much when it was inserted. It's a good size, and the clit stimulator was great!"
2,What?,"Extremely light metal - it's lighter than a tiny Master Lock that I have. It is stainless color, not brass/gold-color, like the picture. The key motion is grainy, as if there is resistance. In my opinion, this is a very low quality lock, at least in terms of how it feels. I can't attest to its performance when it comes to trying to break it - I haven't tried. Nowhere on it does it say ""Master Lock""."
5,great little cosleeper,"we had one of these we used for the first few months of my sons life, until he was able to roll over. he was born in the winter, so it made dad and i more comfortable having him in bed with us with our blankets. its simple and basic, and it was exactly what we were looking for. we didnt want lights and sounds and vibration, and we certainly didnt want to pay $50 or more for one. its easily washable (the sheet is like a velcro closing pillow case, and you can take the plastic supports out of the frame cover to wash it). it held up well, and we passed it on to another co sleeping familiy when we were done with it"
4,"puffy's debut ""amiyumi""","puffy launched their Japanese pop career with this image-defining mini-album. from the opening rocker ""tokusuru karada"" to the hit single ""ajia no junshin"", the whole thing is great. it's not very long, but very good. and a must for the puffy fan. the import price is a little expensive, but if you want it, you won't be disappointed. okuda tamio produces."
5,Ami-chan and Yumi-chan,"""amiyumi,"" the first CD from Japanese duo Puffy is great boppy fun, and a big step above your average j-pop bands like SMAP or Morning Musume. Ami Ohnuki and Yumi Yoshimura are the requisite girl-band cute, and they have some talent as well. While not necessarily big stars in Japan, their one hit ""True Asia"" is included on this CD.""amiyumi,"" while only a short seven songs, does a good job of showcasing what Puffy can do. Quick, synthetic pop on one song followed by quirky guitar rock for another. They have a decent range of styles, all of them clean and enjoyable.Maybe not the best Puffy album, due mainly to its short length, it is still a welcome CD in any collection."
5,The Great Puffy First Album,"Look, if you even found this page, you're way ahead. Puffy Ami Yumi is so good you should just click the add to cart button now, but if you must read on.... The CD includes many a great song, both fast and slow. The complex rock/pop melodies are so interesting that this CD can be lessened to over and over and it still sounds fresh. I heard the hit `True Asia' (included in this CD) while in Japan and picked it up there. Even as a non Japanese speaker, I found that the CD was full of great songs. That was six years ago and I still regularly pull it out. The CD has a rich, deep quality like `Abby Road,' I don't think you can go wrong."
1,This book didn't provide much insight.,"I do not reccomend this book by Baldalamenti. I have read and been collecting self-help books on dating/sex for a couple of years now and I have a number of good ones (and dozens of bad ones!) Instead of this book, get ""How to Succeed with Women"" by Copeland and Louis. They offer practical advice in their book that this one lacks. Beware that you might confuse the two books because of the similar titles."
3,Males and Females: Celebrating the Differences,"Some of the content of this book is quite abstract, but some is practical. Badalamenti points out that men and women have more in common than they have different between them. Yet it is the differences that attract men and women to each other.Women want to be discovered gradually, and for this reason a male should be persistent as he gets to know a woman. A woman wants to sense that she is valued, and that the man is her champion.Dancing is a very effective way for a man to reach into the heart of a woman (pp. 49-51, 226, 278, 297-301, etc.). And women love playfulness in men."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"I've bought several books from here including How to be irresistable to the opposite sex, the guide and ten common dating mistakes which are all quite practical and worthwhile reads. Also bought doubleyourdating by David DeAngelo, bought off his website, which I highly recommend for guys. But How to Succeed with women is just plain drival. I can't understand this guy half the time, I don't know if it is because of his writing style or if he is just living in a fantasy world."
1,Awful,"Any student studying history should skip this movie if they want facts about Wilson. This movie portrays Wilson as a peace and civil rights fighter while in reality, he was a white supremacist and imperialist. But good movie to study how history is glorified because this film is good at glorifying Wilson who probably is one of our ugliest presidents. The funniest scene is when Wilson scolds the German ambassador which is pure fiction (remember that this movie was made during WW2). Leonard Maltin needs to study his history a litte more."
1,Only presented the good side,"A historical review must show both the good side and dark side of a man. While Wilson is heralded for his many progressive views and legislation such as the Federal Reserve, it must be noted that the man was a racist in the true sense of the word. He agreed with segregation and treated blacks as second class citizens. This part, must be shown and not just the rosy side."
5,A lively book of photographs of special children as children,"We Can Do It has photographs of 5 children with Down Syndrome, spina bifida, blindness and cerebral palsy having fun and enjoying ordinary activities at home and at school. The unposed (I think!) photographs are refreshing and inspiring to anyone who has an interest in special needs children, focusing on their abilities. I think it will become a classic."
4,Cute,As a special education teacher I really love this book. The positive portrayal of disability is fantastic and it serves as a great introduction to the topic.Teachers and parents should see this as a jumping off point for a discussion because it introduces terms such as cerebral palsy and down syndrome without explanation and the definitions provided in the back are not kid friendly. Don't just introduce this book to preschoolers blindly. You should be prepared to answer any questions they may have about the conditions.Overall it's a really great and cute book. The focus on inclusion and positivity is great. I love it!
2,Not impressed,"There is some good information in this book, however most is simply common sense. What I did not like about the book is that it is written in a negative tone that implies all workers are slackers. I'm sure there is something better out there and I will look for it."
2,Not impressed either,"Was looking for ""something else"" .. this is more of a script of what to say in sticky situations. Guess it's OK for first-time workers, but if you've been in office environments at all, most of this is just too idealistic and scripted.Feels a little more like 1950 than 1990 and beyond."
3,Great!,A must have for any new manager or supervisor. Provides great advise for almost any situation you may find yourself in. Read it through and keep handy for reference!
4,Keeps my car nice and cool,"When I used to park my car in the driveway in the summer, it got so hot that my water bottle was hot water. So I put this cover over it and it was definitely a lot cooler. The heat was still somewhat noticeable but not that much."
4,So far so good!,I am happy with this purchase so far. It is relatively easy to manage and install. I use it on an old pickup that I don't drive much. It has already started to fade a little bit after a month but it's doing it's job and hasn't blown off in strong thunderstorms either.
1,Had potential but disappointed,"This movie tries to be hard biting drama with a message, but it got lost in a wilderness of poor srcipt and underdeveloped charactars.The kids are annoying rather than lovable. I had no interest in anyone. We watched it to the end in the hopes that somewhere there would be a glimmer of what could have been.Right at the end there's a good example of the poor plot.The neighbours arrive to complain about the meteor and the main kid (who I cared so much about I have no idea what his name was) talks about how that started the ""war of the metoer"", but they won - no explanation of how, no footage of the war, just that they won. Why even mention this? Again, a plot line that goes nowhere.Mike Myers didn't do a bad job - none of the actors did - they just had nothing to work with. This movie just seemed to be trying to ride the coattails of other recent Irish movies that do have good storylines. It was a waste of almost two hours."
1,Painfully bad movie,"Being able to understand what the characters were saying might have made a major difference in my rating, but this movie is totally not understandable. The heavy accents made it impossible for us to watch more than 10 minutes of the movie. It was a pure pleasure to turn it off.Unless you were born in Ireland, you may have trouble understanding what they are saying. I feel this DVD was truly money wasted."
4,Their Best,"This is their best album,it's a much slower album then Kill To Survive but a much better album.Solitary Solitude is the first song on the album,there's thrash at the end of the song.No Mind is awesome,that's one of the faster songs on the album and one of the best.Retaliation rules,that's my favorite song on the album,it's a slow aggressive song that pumps you up(amazing).Deliver Me is a ballad which I do not like.The song Swallow Your Soul is about the movie Evil Dead,great song,a lot of metal bands write about Evil Dead.The last song Razor Ribbon is my second favorite song on the album,the riffs are awesome in that song.This album is not as thrashy(still has some thrash),but better then Kill To Survive.Here are the songs in order and what I rate them out of five stars.Solitary Solitude-5/5No Mind-5/5Decline Of Rule-5/5Retaliation-5/5Deliver Me-2/5The Witching-3/5Lost Life-2/5Swallow Your Soul-5/5Razor Ribbon-5/5"
2,Not so good,"This has been probably the biggest waste of money. After listening to this album, I realized how low budget as well as boring and rushed the production was. Why is it so hard for bands to be creative as well as original. The album talks about horror movies.If you really want to waste money, then buy the whole collection and you will be set."
5,Does the trick,"I had a problem connecting the component cables of my Nintendo Wii to my new Yamaha 7.1 receiver which only accepted component video in coupled with either optical audio or digital coaxial optical cables. As you Wii owners know, the audio out of the Wii component cable has two analog rca connectors. This is a cheap solution that let me set everything together the way that I needed. So far it is performing perfectly!!!!"
1,This doesn't work on a Mac,"When this CD is inserted in a Mac, a window appears declaring that ""the Classic environment is no longer supported."" It appears that this CD was made in 1995, and will not run on more modern Macs. A Google search reveals that problem cannot be solved. The seller (in my case,Indigoheirlooms) disclaims all responsibility for the representation -- made both on the CD cover and on the Amazon website -- that this will run on a Mac. Buyer beware."
5,"Good read,a more personal side of ""The Greatest Generation""","Very enjoyable, amazing life. A good read if you want to be inspired."
4,Good reliable locks,"I bought these because I've had good service from this brand and model in the past. I also wanted two locks that were keyed alike.These Master padlocks seem very durable, and they lock and unlock smoothly, even after years of use. They appear to be strongly made. The blue decorative band at the bottom does eventually break off, but that doesn't affect the operation of the lock.It's worth noting that the photo shows four keys, but the package came with only two. I would have preferred four."
1,ONLY TWO KEYS,"Have returned this item for a replacement because it only came with 2 keys. THE PICTURE SHOWS 4 KEYS. I described fully what the problem was and Lo and Behold, the replacement only had two keys. It appears that customer service does not read what the problems are when they receive a return. Have to return this for a second time. What a waste of time and money!"
1,Disgusting trash! ;Totally Inappropriate,"This book is a disgusting piece of trash! I don't have any idea how anyone could be so sick as to write such inappropriate material. The book is being used for the 5th Annual Avar Press Literary Essay Scholarship Competition for High School Students--2010. I foolishly ordered the book based on the other reviews on this site, thinking that it would be appropriate for my high school senior to read and enter the competition, gaining a chance at winning $10,000 for college tuition expenses. I am shocked that a publisher would think the content and language used in this book is appropriate for high school students. After only reading a few lines and the lexicon, I tore the book into pieces and threw it in the trash (where it belongs). Don't buy this book if you have any morals at all."
4,"Nice Locks, BUT TOO THICK!","First of all these locks a very nice, they are coated with rubber/plastic, and you cannot beat the price for three locks keyed the same.I purchased these locks for the gates in my back yard, however, the loops are too thick and will not slide into the gate lock. Beware if you are purchasing these to lock your gates/fences, it may not fit."
2,Shackles of padlock are not weather protected,"The shackles in this padlock looks like they are protected from the weather in the picture. When I received it I was surprised that they were not. The body and the bottom part of this padlock where one inserts the key are protected as in the photo. I examined the hole where the shackles go in. The part of the shackle that locks the padlock has a hole around it where water will for sure seep in when it rains, making this padlock unusable when the inside get rusty. Poor design for what it is supposed to be used for. Also lack of honesty in the photo."
2,Master lock quality made in China,If compare this set made in China with the same one made in USA which I bought 12 years ago I could tell the quality is completely different. The China one was made of cheap metal. It does not work smoothly after one week and have stain mark on the hook. The reason is hook does not have a cover as the picture shown.Should not buy this lock unless you know it is an real American made.
3,Nice looking but not good in weather,"I bought this pack to use on outdoor sheds. They're nice looking but rust as easily as any other lock. Also, I was surprised to find three locks came with only two keys. I have had to lubricate them often in our rainy weather. Better than no lock..."
2,not as advertised,"Designed to withstand the elements, eh? Maybe a desert. Anything with water and you're looking at a rusty lock pretty quickly.2 stars for being better looking than your average padlock."
3,"Decent lock, but too small","The construction of the lock seems decent, but the shackle is actually smaller than what you would find on a traditional Master combination lock. This is a problem that goes beyond the extra shackle thickness caused by the rubber coating. As such, this lock will only work with very small chains and lock points."
5,falling in love with football,"Michael Lewis does his homeworkWell-written, original and hard to put downEnjoyed the whole book"
3,"Good, but below the high expectations set by Moneyball","Michael Oher's story is certainly interesting, but there's just not enough content for an entire book of this size.I LOVED the chapters on the evolution of the rush defensive end, the West Coast offense, free agency, and everything else that made the LT position so valuable. The early Michael Oher chapters were fascinating. Once he was making it in school and crushing people on the football field, it became a little tedious."
4,a flawed but very interesting bio/sports book,"Reading the jacket blurb, one would think that The Blind Side is the football version of Moneyball - full of insights into a new approach to running a football team. And there is a little of that, as Michael Lewis chronicles the emergence of the left tackle as a position of critical importance. I liked this part of the book, even if it ran on too long and was much too repetitive. Ultimately, this book was the story of one talented boy who rose above a life of poverty and neglect, and with the help of many, got himself an education and a chance to play football at the top level. 80% of this book is a Michael Oher bio, and a good one. While the author tried to make this about big issues in football and society, the book is at its best just telling Oher's story. In spite of a number of flaws, this was a biography that I did enjoy, and I learned a little more about football in the process."
5,Sad but True,Sad that there is more kids in this condition. The true story needed to be told that one can change a life of a needy child.
3,"Great Read, Bad Audio","A friend recommended this book to me after 'reading' it. He entertained me with stories of the history of football strategy, Bill Walsh, the evolution of the West Coast Offense, etc that he'd read in the book. So I bought the abridged audio cd for an 8 hour drive...and listened to a nice 5 hour story about a Tennessee high school left tackle. Half of the interesting football strategy I'd heard about from my friend was cut out of the audio version in favor of the personal interest story that pulls 'The Blind Side' together. In fact, only the first 15-20 minutes were really about football. I went back and read the Sports Illustrated story by Michael Lewis on the Blind Side and some expercts from the text so I could get the complete version, but that's no way to consume a book.I recommend you read The Blind Side and pass on listening to the abridged audio CD."
3,a middle school student,"Overall, the book The Blind Side was a great book, but there were some parts I did not enjoy. What I enjoyed about the book was how the Tuohy cared for Michael and showed affection towards him. I also enjoyed how the school let Michael pursue his dreams by playing sports. Michael was fortunate in finding the Tuohy family because he wouldn't have had the chance to play sports and get a good educationThe book is full of action, but at some parts it became really slow.If you are a die-hard football fan you would like this book the whole way through, otherwise it may be boring at parts. For me, the book was hard to get hooked on because I don't have a love for football and I didn't understand some of the terms. I would rate the book a 3 out of 5 because even though I am not a football fan, I could still feel the emotions throughout the whole book."
1,Miss the interpretation,"I missed the interpretation of this product. The product cover looks like the DVD cover the tile reads The Blind side, now the caption reads The Blind side (Movie Tie-in Edition) (Movie Tie-in Editions) some kind of technical jargon. As I can best recall the product was along side other DVD's listed for sell. My original search was for The Blind side DVD. I hated getting the book, instead of the DVD. I hate paper back's I felt fooled and cheated, so I when to Wal-Mart and bought the DVD."
3,"A good story, but not very insightful","First and foremost: The Blind Side is not Moneyball for football, so if that is what you are hoping for look elsewhere.There are two primary storylines. First, the inner-workings of modern professional football as told through the evolution of the left tackle (aka the ""blind side""). Second, the lives of top high school football recruits, as told through the story of one impoverished high school student who happens to be a ""freak of nature"" football prospect.I would have liked to have seen more of the first, Moneyball-esque, ""inside look"" storyline, and less of the second. Unfortunately for me, Lewis focuses on the second."
4,Great football movie,"This is a good outreaching movie, about reaching out to those in need. Helping those in need. Sandra Bullock best acting. See it."
3,Not the same as the movie,"I had wanted to read the book, as I thought the movie was terrific. And, I wrongly assumed the book would simply be a more in-depth account of the movie. Wrong! I am not a big fan of football, and this book is definitely much more about football than the movie. But, I did read the whole thing, and overall I liked it. It's still a great story but not to be confused with the big screen version. If you don't like reading about sports, you may want to avoid this book. But, if you don't mind the sports center of it, and want to experience the story from a different vantage point than the movie - this is a good book for you."
4,A satisfying real-life story,"The book and the movie are both excellent. Does not matter whether you've already seen the movie, you'llstill enjoy the book. A quick, satisfying read and you don't have to be an NFL fan."
4,Good read despite being not exactly what you might think from the movie,"My family saw the movie so we decided to get the book; I remembered vaguely reading a New York Times magazine piece that Lewis wrote on the subject some time ago that I assume was excerpted from the book and thought it would be interesting to get the full story. It's an interesting and enjoyable book overall, with one main caveat: the movie for obvious reasons takes the Michael Oher story as the primary focus, while the book is fairly balanced between Oher's inspiring life story and the larger story about the ""evolution of a game,"" namely football, that Lewis addresses using Oher as a jumping-off point. As long as you understand that's going on and aren't surprised you should enjoy the story and the football analysis!"
3,the blind side(movie tie-in edition),"I saw the movie first. then read the book,it gave a more detailed look and insight of the athelete. good movie but for me the book had to much info on football."
5,Good buy!,The book was exactly what I was looking for. The product arrived in a timely fashion and sure beat heading to the mall.
3,The Blind Side,"Anyone looking for a rags to riches story involving football, this is the book for you! A great story, but the narrative is a bit slow in places. A great book for anyone wanting to understand where the different offenses came from, and the importance of the left offensive tackle position."
4,interesting,"An interesting book that educates the reader of the increased value of the left tackle position in the NFL to tell the more compelling story of the social and athletic development of Michael Oher. As a football fan, I thought there was enough of the evolution of the position to learn something, which provided an adequate level of context toward Michael Oher's evolution. The author did an excellent job in getting you involved with the depth of Michael's struggles, and in making you want to keep your eyes on Michael Oher moving forward. The only think that stopped me from 5 stars was the simplicity in which some of the challenges (i.e college qualification)resolved themselves."
3,Not his best,"As another reviewer pointed out, only 20% of the book is actually about the evolution of football. That part is excellent, and typical of Lewis' best work (especially Moneyball). The rest of the book is like 'hoop dreams' except the kid gets adopted by rich white people. They seem like nice folks, and I'm sure they won't abandon him if he blows out a knee, but is there really any sort of lesson to take away?"
2,More about the NFL than Michael,"I couldn't wait to get the book and will be seeing the movie in the next couple of days. I was really disappointed in the book. It was more focused on how things are done in the NFL and oh by the way a little about Michael Oher. It should have been all about Michael and a little background on the ""blind side"" not the other way around. Skip the book unless you are an armchair quarterback and just go see the movie. I heard it is great and can't wait to see it."
5,"Inspiring, Enlightening and Thought Provoking","Lewis does an excellent job once again of keeping you engaged while educating your brain on a largely unnoticed phenomenon in the sports - the incredibly high value of the left tackle. All the while he is telling you a true story of the redemption of a kid with absolutely nothing from one of the poorest zip codes in the US by an affluent family with a heart big enough to love the 330 pound boy from the other side of the tracks. A must read if you like football, or live in the south, or care anything about those trapped in poverty."
5,More then the movie,"A more comprehensive and detailed account of how the interactions of people can change one persons live so much, and have such an effect on so many. A great human story and very uplifting."
4,Did they go too far?,"A very well written book as are all Michael Lewis books. However, I felt like taking a shower after reading the end. The book did not have a ""happily ever after"" feel to it. The Tuohys(especially Leigh Ann) were not going to see Michael fail and would not let anything get in their way including an injured 3 year old boy. The correspondance school with BYU and the ""tutor"" made me question how much Michael actually learned. There was so much ego involved and I was left wondering if Michael was so keen on starting a Center for children like him (with his money) to keep Leigh Ann busy and supported her threats of him tranferring. I wish Michael well but I note he was second string All SEC and I hope he is prepared for life and not just running a Taco Bell."
3,I'm sure the movie has to be better,"I'm a big football fan (3 fantasy leagues) and I found many parts of this book boring because it was too technical and focused too much on recruiting and football strategy, rather than the interpersonal relationships between the player, coach, etc. I think this will be a rare case where the book is not as good as the movie."
4,Time Well Spent,"The Blind Side has great information. I teach students like Michael and I found the story very inspirational. The football information was very interesting. However, if you are not into football, you can skip those chapters and still get all of Michael's story. The most valuable information for me was the facts about differences in the children from different economic classes which are apparent as early as kindergarten."
1,Not what I thought it was going to be.,"I thought it was going to be more like the movie. All the history of the game was not anything of interest to me. If I were a football fan read it, they would probably enjoy it."
4,the blind side,The blind side is a great book. I liked the part where people would see michel and freak out about how big he was. I would rate it 4 stars. The book wasn't easy to read the readablility was hard. I would recomend it to tennagers and adults. I think this book would be hard for kids to understand. I think this book is fun to read. The book teaches you to help others and when you do it can really bless your life.
4,great read,"A must read!Especially for football fansFor movie fans...a ""should read"" as it fills in a lot of the ""artistic license"" that takes place between book and film (especially when the book is written by a very good friend of the family).Regardless, the book actually made me weep more than the film.My suggestion is that you buy both."
3,More of a non fiction feel,"The story line was interesting, and the writing engaging, but the sports detail was so extensive that the story became secondary. Midway, it began to read like a non-fiction focused on the politics of sports rather than fiction. Overall, disappointing."
3,the Blind Side,"Enjoyed the movie, The book was gearded towards those w;ho follow football players career."
3,not impressed,I found myself skipping page after page of football history. At first it was interesting but soon got out of hand. Watch the DVD it's better.
2,the blind Side,A little disappointed in this book -- It was so much football and not just about Michael and the family. There was alot of the book that I just skipped because it did not deal with his life.(I am not a football history person) I was looking for more like the movie.
2,150 pages too long - really just 3 or 4 good short articles,"The book is 314 pages, about 150 pages too long. There's 3 or 4 article length stories here. The book is a Frankenstein, with two disparate themes#1) the evolution of the left tackle in professional football#2) Pygmalion Redux - an African American's journey from poverty to prominence.Theme #1 is football clinical - I enjoyed it, but the average reader might start to snooze.Theme #2 is heartwarming - but there's very little meat on the bone. Michael Oher won't open up to anyone, so the author is forced to present Michael's story from everyone else's viewpoint.All the participants are wonderfully likeable - no one appears to have any warts.The book - it's not quite a ""Paper Lion"" and it's certainly not an ""Angela's Ashes"".For comtemporary sports journalism, I would choose Gary Smith's ""Going Deep""."
3,Less about football than a bio of Michael Oher,"Not a bad book by any means; Lewis is a fine writer who draws you into the story. But I came into this book hoping for an interesting analysis of football -- specifically how the game has changed since Lawrence Taylor taught coaches they had to protect the quarterback's blind side.Instead, 90 percent of the book is a biography of Michael Oher, a star left tackle currently playing college ball and expected to be an early NFL draft pick.The good stuff -- rather, what I was expecting from the book -- is concentrated at the beginning and end, when Lewis goes into detail about football itself and how it has changed since the '80s.So if you'd like an interesting biography of a homeless kid turned football star, you'll love this. But if you're looking for a book about football, you might want to look elsewhere."
2,Annoying book,"I loved the movie. The book? Not so much.As an avid HS and college football fan, I appreciate the emphasis on the evolving game.As a long-time teacher, I appreciate the efforts to bring a struggling child up to his potential.As a football mom, well... Let me just say that we don't have bazillions of dollars and a myriad of contacts at our respective alma maters (and beautiful window treatments and $2000 kitchen tables). Nor were we willing to flaunt the rules or have our son declared LD and then sign him up for ""personal development"" classes from an online school so that he could circumvent the NCAA rules. He's playing DII ball on his own merits, and we're happy about that.I'm 3/4 of the way through this book, and while I am not one to give up on a book, I am just tired of reading this.The Tuohys have lots of money. Money talks. Ho-hum."
2,Unfulfilled promise,"The premise of the store is interesting. How did left tackle become one of the most important positions in football? The first half of the book does a fair job of walking through the reasons. (West Coast offense, LT, etc.)Unfortunately, at that point Lewis runs out of things to write about, so he starts talking about Michael Oher, an O Lineman at Ole Miss. Oher's story is intersting, but it is too early to tell. He is a ""superstar"" but only a sophomore. I also think that Lewis overdoes how great Oher already is.I also don't really understand what Oher's story really had to do with the original premise of the book. Is Lewis saying that because left tackles now make millions, Oher wants to be one? I would think that if Oher had come around in the 70s people would still have thought of him as a football player. Last time I checked lineman were big and strong (and quick) in that era too."
1,what were their real motives???,"This book needed a non-biased author.The first part talks so much about football, that I almost lost interest (although, it WAS kinda interesting). However, half-way through, I kept thinking those doubting thoughts, and sure enough, the book just reinforced how I felt.There were so many things that sickened me about the Touhys. First, the fact they ""pushed"" him to go to Ole Miss; 2nd, the use of someone else's baby picture!; 3rd the whole ""christian"" aspect of it (the ""holier-than-thou"" attitude); and finally I'd had enough when it was explained how they got around the system when it came to his education.It DOES make me wonder what their motives were. I just hope they're not making a dime off Oher's success (even though they probably are). And after seeing LeAnn interviewed on tv, it made me dislike her so much. The NCAA had every right to investigate.I hate not finishing books, but I got to about page 200 and couldn't take anymore."
4,Captivating Story,"It's quite an odd subject for a writer of Michael Lewis's stature to cover, and the story line of the book is quite odd too. It made more sense at the end of the book when Lewis explained that the Touhy family of Memphis, TN are old friends of his. The story of the impoverished high school student Michael Oher from Memphis, TN was fascinating on many levels. The importance of sports today guarantees that a superior talent will be found and nurtured one way or another. Oher's case is about as extreme as you can imagine - being ""adopted"" by a wealthy Memphis family and hand-held all the way to an improbable college football scholarship and apparantely very good shot at the NFL. It's an extremely well researched and captivating story that will interest many, put particularly sports fans."
3,Good book with issues,"The true story about an upper class family who adopts a 16-year-old boy who weighs 345 pounds and came from the other side of the tracks. They gave him a first class education and found creative ways to get him into college on an athletic scholarship. He went on to become a first round draft choice in the NFL with the Baltimore Ravens (2009). There may be too much football in this book for some, but a good story nevertheless. Some bad language - so not for children (the reason I rated it down)"
4,Enjoyable even if you don't love football,"Michael Lewis weaves another delightful story about a poor black boy, Michael Oher, who becomes a football star. It is an inspiring tale of a generous family which is a testament to the role of environment in individual achievement. Lewis makes the story more interesting by analyzing the evolution of NFL football and how the role of right tackle has gained significant importance over the past twenty years or so. I'm not a big football fan, but I enjoyed the football stuff as well as Michael Oher's story. He manages to connect the two stories effectively. Lewis is a delightful writer as usual."
4,Fascinating story,"There's a lot to like about this book. The story of African-American Michael Oher and how his acceptance into a conservative Southern family helped him develop from a homeless, socially awkward teenager into a self-confident left tackle pursued by coaches from college-football powers, is heart-warming. Michael Lewis's writing is deft, and his effort at tying Oher's story into an account of how the left tackle position became so important in the NFL is masterful. It's a good read for football fans, and even non-fans can enjoy this rags-to-riches story as well. The movie version is good, too, but I recommend the book for its depth and detail."
3,Ok,"I found the book ok... not as interesting as the movie. it didnt keep me too interested, but cant please everyone"
2,Michael's Story,Very different from movie. Didn't like the cuz words. Felt that only a certain percentage was about Michael. Somewhat disappointing.
4,Covering the Blind Side,"The story of Michael Oher is one of the great, touching personal stories coming out of the 2009 NFL Draft. From a homeless child born to a drug-addled mother to his early days with a wealthy Tennessee family and onward through high school and college, Michael's tale is remarkable, poignant and touching. It would be difficult to imagine reading this and not being moved by it.But it is the story of the history of the left tackle position as well as the story of a young boy growing into a man. While it could stand on its own as a 'coming of age' tale, it is in the skilled talents of Michael Lewis and his deft wrapping of the individual threads of history and modern thought with personal challenge, effort and triumph that makes this one of the best sports reads of the decade."
3,The Blind Side,I enjoyed the book but it is written more as a history than a story. The movie is much better.
4,was a little dissapointed,i for one loved the book im a huge sports fan but it was a little boring. i understand that he wanted to make it a little educational but i found it boring. i think michael could've made learning a little more exciting
4,"Finally, a feel good book that isn't cheezy...","I loved this book and movie. If you love inspirational books, please check out Live Like A Fruit Fly (also on amazon) - I am the author and just trying to spread the word :)"
3,Repetitive,"After reading the book I was interested to see if others felt the same as I, that the book felt repetitive as if the author was trying to fill pages. This story could have been a feature magazine article. Half way through I just wanted it to end."
4,"Interesting character analysis, what's with the misspellings?","I am currently reading this book for the second time. I enjoy the uniqueness of Michael Oher's personality, especially in the context of his personal environment. However, while reading this again I've come across at least four misspelled names without searching them out. Included are misspellings of Matt Leinart (Leinert), Adrian Peterson (Petersen), Patrick Ramsay (Ramsey), and Bob Stoops (Stoopes). I guess I will never understand this amount of errors in a major release."
5,Great story & read!,"Buy this book! I enjoyed it so much that, after reading it, I immediately went online and searched for more information about the main character and his current team. The author, Michael Lewis, also does a wonderful of job of weaving in pertinent background information about the history of the NFL passing game, and the importance of the left tackle position in football. If you're looking for a great read, look no further! Michael Oher's story is as inspiring as it gets!"
5,A superbly written book,"If you don't care a lick about football, you probably won't get much out of this book; but if you have even a glimmer of interest in football and enjoy books that are well written, then do yourself a favor and read Blind Side. Michael Lewis is someone who can develop a story--he writes stunningly well."
2,"Title Subject Agreement, Please","As many others have noted, this book is not about the evolution of the game of football as much as it is the story of Michael Oher. As interesting as Oher's story might be, it is disappointing to expect one type of book and find yourself reading something very different. I read and enjoyed ""Moneyball"" and expected this book to provide the same kind of analysis that would cause me to view football in a different light, as ""Moneyball"" did with baseball. It did not.It is a quick read, but I learned very little about the game of football. Most of the points made are fairly basic and pretty evident for fans of the game. If I had known beforehand what this book focused on, I would not have read it. That is why it merits two stars.In the future, I will be more careful before selecting a Michael Lewis book."
5,Incredible Story,"Mr. Lewis again takes us to the heart of the matter. This is a story about football, a family, a lost young man, coaches, poverty, education, loss and the will to survive. Mr Lewis weaves a fine tapestry of tales that centers on young man by the name of Michael Ofer. His journey and that of the family that ""adpots"" him is at the center of this remarkable story. Mr. Lewis in his reporter's style fleshes things out from all angles. I could not put this book down. It was easily one of the BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR!!!"
2,Multiple Stories; Only One Truly Worthwhile the Reading Effort,"If you are a true die-hard, in-the-wool football fan and love reading about the game and its history, then this book is well worth reading. HOWEVER, if you are reading the book to learn the story of Michael Oher, then you will be frustrated, turning the pages rapidly to get to those depicting his story. Don't get me wrong, the author knows his football and is adept at telling its history, as well as those unique players that have contributed to the game. As for Michael's story - - - see the movie. It's more rewarding."
3,"All bark, no bite....","I ordered this book because it was on the syllabus for a German class I'm currently taking. I'm not sure that outside of this class the book would be of much use. It's really nice as a supplemental tool, but not as a main teaching tool. In fact, we cover a lot more in our class than the book does. For instance, our teacher will gave us more information on the use of prepositional phrases than what is provided in this text. I would not recommend it for people who are trying to learn German on their own. Plus, I think it's a little too expensive."
4,Getting to the point,"This is a great book to use in conjunction with a course, not on your own. FIU is offering a course that goes by the same title, which makes the understanding of the grammer easier to digest. If you are serious about learning to decipher German text, or just want to become fluent in another language, I suggest you enroll in a basic German I course, so that it all comes together. With this book I have moved forward in my knowledge faster than I did when I just took German I for a full semester. If you are serious about learning, this is a great handbook."
1,Beginers look elsewhere!,"I used this textbook in my first German class. I am a visual learner and this book doesn't have charts etc. that are needed if you are a visual learner. I knew nothing about German & I didn't really learn anything from this book. I consider buying this book a waste of money. If you have to have it for a class, try to borrow it from someone unlucky enough to have purchased it.I am retaking German 1 and the book we are using is Essential German Grammar (2002) by Durrell, Kohl, and Loftus. (Unfortunately it just went out of print so you will have to search for it.) It has lots of charts where the endings are in red so they are easily distinguished from the black type of the rest of the word. It focuses on learning patterns to recognize subject, main clause, subordinate clauses, etc. As a visual learner, this book is quite helpful!"
3,"necessary, but not great","I needed this book for a class. But as ""reading knowledge"" textbooks go, this one is not amazing. It is not organized logically, nor does it have tables, so that if you want to review, it is very confusing to find, let's say, all the verb conjugations. I suppose by the end I will have learned the necessary information, but this is not nearly as painless as it should be."
4,Good for what I need,"I don't know how well it would hold up to heavy duty use on a regular basis (its not the same level of quality more expensive bits are), but it's perfect for boring out plastic lawnmower wheels."
3,A good tool for medical folks,"Anyone in the medical profession who deals with children on a daily basis will tell you that kids don't like coming to the doctor. They don't like being examined and they certainly don't like the white coats. So anything that can help ease their anxiety is a welcome asset. Tokar provides such a tool.He describes several simple magic tricks using common clinic items that are easy to learn and sure to have a lasting impact on your younger patients, putting them at ease in the exam room, making the exam easier and certainly alleviating their future fears. This is well worth the time and the effort."
3,Practical?,"This is a good, fun read; very light and very quick. It's ideal to dip into and some of the items I'll certainly use. However, most I won't. Or, more to the point, can't. Many of the effects in here require too much preparation with secret gimmicks etc. The cut and restored stethoscope is great... but unfortunately quite inpractical. Many of these effects would be ideal for the HCP that has their own office or consult room. For the wards or A&E, many of these are just too lengthy. They are simply the same magic tricks that many magicians perform but the author's have attempted to make them work by substituting the materials for that of medical equipment, with no regard to the surroundings. A great book and I would probably buy it again, but expected way too much."
1,A bit too basic,"I have Sue Waters newer book which is done very well. I was very disappointed when I got this, her older book, to discover that the projects were very amaturish. There was not much substance to the book for the price so therefore I will be returning the book to Amazon (alas this is the price you pay for buying a book when you cannot see the contents)."
2,NOT REALLY WHAT I WANTED OR NEEDED,"I have been working with gourds for quite a few years now, something like over thirty. There was very little in this work I found to be useful. I am sorry to say I agree fully with another reviewer here who was less delighted with this particular work that probably I am. I did give it two stars simply for effort though. I strongly suggest you search further as there are quite a large number of books out there that are of better quality and certainly more worth the money spent."
2,"don't judge a book by it's cover,how true!","Very disappointed that this book did not have a actual gourd that was pictured on the cover ""inside"" the book! What a disappointment. I purchased this book for the eagle that was pictured on the cover. There was no pattern for such project."
1,Disappointed,This was the only gourd book that I have that I am totally disappointed in. I admire Sue Walter's gourd work but the book had 8 designs and patterns that I thought were some of her inferior designs. Maybe I was just expecting more from Sue as she is a great gourd artist. It was almost like she didn't want to share any of her great ideas but showed us the lesser ones. I wouldn't buy another book by her unless I hear rave reviews on it. The patterns were definitely gourd crafts and not gourd art.
2,2 strikes-it's out!!,"I ordered this item because the price seemed reasonable and the product appeared comparable to other Ottomans I reviewed. Unfortunately, the quality may be questionable. Initially received the item in a timely manner but it had a tear in the cushion. Returned it and received the item a second time also damaged with multiple tears and defects. Returned the item and requested a refund. Obviously material is poor quality and if it can't withstand the abuse of shipping, it will not last long in a household with 3 kids and multiple pets."
5,Nice for the price!,"Great value on a quality item. I've been searching for a large storage ottoman like this for years, but have not seen a real leather one for less than $600 anywhere. For real leather, you can't beat that price...and FREE SHIPPING too! I ordered this on a Sunday and had it the following Thursday! How does Amazon make any money!?"
4,What a great deal!,I found this same ottoman at a local furniture store for twice the cost and they wanted to charge me for delivery. It's perfect for our space and the extra storage is fantastic. I think the company that shipped it must have read the previous reviews because our ottoman came in pristine condition with the legs detached and in the storage space. I would definitely recommend this ottoman to a friend!
5,Great Value!,"What will you like about this ottoman? It's a great classy looking piece of furniture, it's well-made, quality workmanship and it holds a whole-lotta-stuff. I have mine filled with blankets and pillows for when the grandkids come over. No tools needed, just tighten the legs into the pre-drilled holes. The color is very, very dark brown, like dark chocolate or strong coffee. Fast and EZ delivery by UPS. I'm glad I took a chance on this. It's a great value."
3,Nice looking but not for young kids,"As others have written, the first delivery was so battered in transit (given the flimsy packaging) that it had to be returned. I couldn't even take it out of the box. The replacement came quickly, but has damaged leather. Minor - and I would keep it despite the leather problems - but be warned that although the Amazon description says the lid props up so that there will be no accidental slams, this could be a real danger for a young child. The Ottoman is wide and the lid heavy. A simple touch on the lid from the fully open state and it slams down very hard. A child could get injured easily trying to play inside. As I have a two year old, I will be returning this for one that is safer."
2,O.K.,"This book is nat as good as it sounds on the back. If you are just starting to read Christopher Pike books you probably shouldn't start with this one. believe me Christopher Pike has written MUCH better books than this. What Marvin does neart the end is shocking, it truly will make you change your opinion on what kind of guy he is."
3,good book but bad compared to Wizrd,"I've had a good time reading this book, but I have only read this after I read Wizrd by Steve Zell. It's better than this book by a lot. If I read Master of Murder first, I might've thought it was a great book. But compared to Wizrd, this book is only average."
1,all wrong,"everything suggested the item was the actual game. when looking over the order, i bought the codes/cheats and not the game. tried to cancel but not able to. never shop here again! thanks for nothing dude."
1,BAD,"EVERYTHING ON MY ITEM SAID IT WAS A GAME THEN WHEN I CLICK ""PAY"" IT TURNS OUT TO BE CHEATS? AND IT WON'T LET ME CANCEL IT!"
5,Ultimate Codes disk for Vice CIty,I Think this Cheat disk is great but I have no clue what the unknown cheats are for.
5,10th level hand Review,"The second is just as good as the first, expect more creative fights to hand to hand combat with all the high flyin action in this sequel.Pick this one up martial arts movie fan!"
5,"Clean, strong, durable, and cheap.","Great product for great price. The locks are easy to secure, easy to unlock, and endure a lot of stress without any issues. Recommended for securing Pelican cases."
4,Locks keyed alike are great,"Having the locks keyed alike is great. I got these to use on my pop-up camper, which required a pretty small diameter shackle; this was one of the few locks I could find small enough. The camper spends 90% of its storage time indoors, so the locks don't see much weather at all. One of them starting getting difficult to lock already after a few months. Using the key to open the lock allowed the shackle to slide right in, but it shouldn't be like this, thus the 4 stars."
1,Review of Master Lock 140Q,All of the locks were very stiff & even after lubricating the mechanisms they were all still difficult to open & close.
2,Pad Locks,"They are what im looking for. Im upset that i bought 3 packs (12 total) and there's a spot that i checked ""keyed alike"" but every pack uses a different key. My landscaping trailer has a pad lock for each and every piece of equipment. 4 weed eaters, 2 hedge clippers, 2 leaf blowers, 2 push mowers, 1 toolbox, and 1 lock to hold the trailer to the hitch. Thats 12 pad locks and i have to now engrave all the locks and keys so we know which goes where. time is money and when you make 12-15 stops per day not knowing what key goes where will cost 5 mins per day looking for the right key. They should all of had the same key code. I wish i would of paid more and got what i wanted. That is Keyed alike locks. Dont offer it if your not going to send it. not gonna pay for a return."
3,"A solid well made padlock, however may cause reproductive issues and has ingredients known to cause cancer.","Bought this sturdy lock for my gun case, I have no beefs with this lock as its well made and extremely affordable. I gave it 3 stars because reading the label sticker it said warning: this product contains one of more chemicals know to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. wash hands after handling, which I would have anyway. but seriously who sells a lock that has those kinds of dastardly effects? while I know we are all surrounded by cancer causing ingredients, you mean to tell me I have to worry about my reproductive health handling a padlock? Fail!!!"
4,Good locks,"I use these locks to have 4-5 locks at various locations I use frequently, (Various work buildings, my house, downtown library), and they perform well. I love having only one (two really) keys, that I have multiple copies of at home, in case I lose the key. These are defenitly solid feeling, for such small locks. The shackle is large enough to fit the two ends of most steal cables.Things I would improve - The ability to order 2 sets of 4 with the same key. The edges are a little sharp when you purchase them. The lock needs to be oiled (bike chain oil) after 3-4 months of outdoor use, or it starts to ""Lock"" open, I have not had to oil one twice, would be nice if they shipped from masterlock ""lubed""."
5,Great Item,"Good product, good price. It can be hard to find 4 keyed alike padlocks. These are great and just perfect for our use. We use them for the tow bar setup on the vehicle we tow behind our motorhome."
4,just what I wanted,"I've been searching for a spiked, gold-plated pickle for longer than I can tell you, so I was thrilled to find one on Amazon.A couple of warnings to prospective buyers, though: first, the gold plating is thin and does not stand up to vigorous use, especially when body lotion, peanut butter or whipped cream is involved. Second, the actual item is a bit bigger than the picture suggests, so you might want to try some, ahem, stretching exercises first."
2,The Goggles -- They Do Nothing,"Nice and shiny and covered in gold. That's 'Au' for you periodic-table geeks!It has sharp points, and I'm not sure what it's really supposed to be used for.... I can't see it as very comfortable as a Marital Aid.However, keep the points away from your eyes! You will damage your cornea ... or even poke a hole in your eye, and all the aqueous humor will run out. Wear goggles, or be warned!Frankly, I don't know why it's called ""Guardian Angel"". It looks more like a golden garden gnome or cactus."
2,"WARNING: Thin Gold Layer rubs off, then spikes puncture skin.","While the company claims this device is ""Plated with 24K gold to prevent puncturing the skin"" What they FAIL to mention is that the gold plating is really thin and rubs off after several sessions. After that the ""spring loaded tip"" tends to shoot the spikes directly through your hand. As a result I have experienced all of the injuries it claims to prevent including chronic pain, arthritis, headaches, colds, stroke, diabetes, heart disease etc.My doctors say the symptoms will dissipate in a few months now that he has extracted the orange spike covered ball from my swollen, bleeding hand."
3,"Not an actual angel, hard to clean","I thought I wanted an extra guardian angel because I could feel that the one freely assigned to me was getting lonely and sad. You can imagine my disappointment when I found that THIS guardian angel is not, in fact, an angel. It's like a squeeze ball but of an odd shape with metal spikes in it.To make things worse, my little girl thought she could use it as a comb for her dollies and, you can imagine what happened. All her old dollies are bald now and it was impossible to remove that fine doll hair off the angel. Our little princess was inconsolable until she got half a dozen new Hanna Montana, Bratz, Barbie Princess/Mermaid dollies but, at least she learned a lesson - never again attempt to groom your dolly with a hair brush that's not certified by the original manufacturer.The good thing is that my true guardian angel found this entire story to be very funny and her mood has improved significantly since. We're going to keep it, I guess."
2,Did Not Guard Me,"This is not a good guardian angel.It did not guard me as I began to be led down temptations path. The path was clearly marked and I should have known better; however I had my guardian angel with me and I thought everything would be fine. It wasn't. I don't care how many pressure points it hit, it certainly didn't put any pressure on me to stop going down the path I was going down."
3,Had Good Points and Sharp Points,"The ""Guardian Angel"" is a pretty fun toy for my spouse and I, and it sure tickles parts of me that I didn't know I had! However, I am sorely disappointed by the lack of a ""vibration mode."" They should make the Vibrating Guardian Angel!Despite its flaws, my fatigue and stress melted away, and I sleep like a baby every time my spouse uses it on me!"
5,misuse abounds,"I don't care what it was intended to be used for... but this thing is the greatest adult toy I've ever found. After years of rigorous activity I found my tires were lacking tread. I was unable to find the right toy to fill my very gaping needs. Then i saw this...If you're a little worked out and want something that fills you up, buy this."
4,Perhaps I misread the instructions???,"This could be a great product, I won't touch it again. I must have misread the instructions, because this didn't relieve colon tension at all!!!"
2,Get what you pay for.,"This drill bit was the right size, price, and it seemed to arrive quickly, however: You get what you pay for as this bit does not cut well at all. At various speeds, it chunks out rather than cuts smooth!! Would not recommend."
1,Please Give me my money back!,"That or nothing is the same. By going on forum and new group, more information can be found! Francois."
2,A psp game for Twisted Metal,"Twisted Metal is one of my more favorite franchises in all of my years of gaming, but this game doesn't really keep up with what I'm used to.It's higher grade of cartoony art-work is really flattering at first, but it quickly becomes annoying.The characters aren't very fun, and some seem to topple over others easily.Tower Tooth is nearly impossible to face on your own, I used the fastest character and Tower Tooth would still be able to run me over.In short, this is probably one of the least well-made games of the Twisted Metal franchise, but it's good for it's 50 minutes of fun.If you want one of, my opinion, better Twisted Metal games, you would find more luck with Twisted Metal Black, or Twisted Metal 3Twisted Metal: Head-on - 6/10"
3,A New twist on an old classic.,"Twisted Metal is a game I really enjoyed when I first heard about it on PSone. It was fun, the characters were colorful, and the game play was great. Now for Head-On, the first 2 are still true, but the last one is not. The controls are way too sensative. That is the only knock I have on the game. If your a fan of the game and have great hand-eye coordination, you'll enjoy it."
4,"Best car shooter, but the only car-shooter","Ok, this is a TIGHT game. It has a ""Franchise"" sort-of mode. Im really impressed with the lightning fast graphics, and almost all other aspects of the game, BUT I hate how the controls are set-up. Why mess-the control's up? Well, ill leave it up to anybody to buy this game, with the risky controls. Im out"
2,NO GOOD,"This game was WAY TOO SHORT I beat it in a matter of minutes (half hour)Once you beat the game, there's nothing to do,: either go through the same stupid levels with another character, or you can play online against friendsBut if you're like me and you don't have a wireless connection or friends who can even afford PSP, this game is no goodAlso, the gameplay STINKS"
2,I have 2 words...,"HORRIBLE CONTROLS!!! ALL U DO IN THIS GAME IS DRIVE AROUND IN A TRUCK WITH A CLOWN ON IT AND SHOOT PEOPLE... THAT IS IT!! NOTHIN ELSE... WHEN U TRY TO SHOOT SOMEONE, U CAN NEVER GET A DIRECT HIT. WHEN U TRY 2 TURN U GO FAST AND OUT OF CONTROL... DONT GET THIS GAME... GET EITHER RIDGE RACER OR *NEED FOR SPEED UNDERGROUND RIVALS........"
1,Wow dont listen to them,Please save your money and dont buy this game. First of all the story mode is beatable in about 25 minutes. You could be playing and accidently enter a code! yeah thats righ 2 times its happened to me. Near the end boss i was playing and i accidently entered inf life without knowing! and later on inf ammo and i had no clue about the codes. This game gets boring really fast and it takes wayyy too long to kill one single enemie on here. the game isnt worth the buy nor the rent. save your money!
4,good bussiness,"thanks very much my son really enoy playing this game.this gift was giving to him for christmas,so thanks very muh."
5,Christmas Gift,"Bought this for our 6 year old and he loves this game. I love that there are no bad words like grand thief auto games. Great price, great game!"
3,A Gift,"This item was purchased as a gift so I have no actual knowledge of the DVD. However, it did arrive when promised."
3,Wrong system,I suppose I am somewhat of an idiot because I thought this was for a PS2 not a PSP when i ordered it. But it was years ago and I am just now writing to give a review. I sold it at a pawn shop the day after I got it.
5,great text book,"i find this very detailed, but still an excellent text, great visuals and diagrams,well writted and readable"
4,Neat Little Volume!,"I like this little book ... and if you're looking for some light reading that will help you gain insight into the beliefs of Catholics, this volume is for you. The Coleman family has done a good job of outlining the basics of the faith while avoiding the tendency toward ""Catholic fundamentalism"" that is so pervasive today. The answers in this booklet are laid out so as to be readable and well-organized. The authors wisely avoid divisive issues, but they do a good job introducing non-doctrinal issues that are being discussed in the church today (such as gospel authorship and mandatory celibacy for priests). Although there are a couple of places in the book where nuance might be helpful, one must remember that this volume is offered as a simple expression of the basics of the Roman Catholic faith. In that sense, the authors have done a nice job and I recommend this volume to those who are looking for such an introduction."
3,"Tool: 4 stars, packaging: 1 star.","Must've borrowed this type of tool 20 times in the last few months and of course haven't needed one since I bought this one. Anyway, looks to be a pretty good tool. As beefy and similar looking to the Blue Point/Snap-On one I have been using. Only reason I was dissapointed when I opened it was a lack of a box. I guess I shouldn't have assumed it would've come in a moulded plastic box like every other multiple-piece tool I've bought, but I did. Now I have these 6 pieces of metal floating around in a small cardboard box in my tool box. May sound trivial but it makes it feel cheap to me. Like I said, the tool appears to be good, so if the lack of a container doesn't bother you this is the tool for you."
5,"When she says ""Wisdom,"" she isn't kidding.",Mrs. Coyle's devotion from Proverbs is so insightful; even if you're not a homeschooling mom (I happen to be a single woman in the working world). The principles she exposits with such conviction are applicable to believing women of all ages and stations in life -- because it is straight from the Word of God.My own walk with the Lord has benefitted greatly from reading this book and meditating on Proverbs. I highly recommend reading this little devotional with a huge heart.
5,Casey (Buckhorn Brothers Book 5),This book was exactly what I was told it would be. The book was exactly as descriged and was shipped within a reasonable amount of time.
2,I'm not buying,"I read the story from beginning to end and while I can admire the writers talent, the story didn't ring true. It was almost impossible to believe that a rational, intelligent man with lots of female adoration would spend 8 years worrying about the one he chose not to bed. The part about the effects of parental alcholism and its effects on children was well done. It would have been helpful to include some info on the dangers of indiscriminate sex in the 21st century."
2,How she stretched it.,"I have to give it to her. There were moments when I wasn't suffering though the book, but they were few and far between. Maybe it was because I read the whole series at once and I was just sick of the characters, but I couldn't get into the story. There were problems in the book that needed to be resolved, but now that I'm done I don't know how she made the book as long as it was. I had a hard time thinking of Casey as an adult and not as the teenager he was throughout the whole book. Emma got on my nerves. It was a lot of romance but the issues in the book really didn't have anything to do with the romance itself. Basically, the book was a really long story with no plot. I read it in a day and wouldn't let myself put the book down. I wasn't sure if i would ever finish the story if I put the book down."
5,Great!,"I had an older 500mb version of one these for about 7-8 years, unfortunately it got destroyed by a leaky bottle of tea in a helmet comapartment, but other than that it was very durable.The new one I got is the same item, even the same colour, except with an extra 500mb, ie. 1GB.What I love about these is that they use AAA barrteries, no charging, the SD slot(not SDHC on the old one, not sure about new one, haven't tried) so you can have just about limitless songs with you, the hold button which prevents accidental bumping of buttons, and the random function, which will random all of the songs, unlike another mp3 player I have from a different manufacturer.Then the volume is plenty loud on these.Plus the thing is, these things are nice and small."
3,Needles in needlestacks,"3 1/2Several amazingly conceived, eccentrically breakneck passages carry the weight of a winning, if imbalanced release."
4,"Solid, exactly as promised","Very nice, bought it as a printer stand. Easy to assemble. No rollers for the drawers, they just slide wood to wood. Hanging file drawer has rollers."
5,Good purchase,"Great product, does what it says it does. Easy construction, would recommend this product to anyone looking for an end table/filing cabinet."
2,Not holding up well.,"At first I was impressed by the heavy weight solid wood, but the construction has proven to be shoddy and the cabinet is not holding up. The wooden ""tracks"" that the drawers run on are too short so the drawers come off the track and get stuck. Also, one of the handles has come off 3 times already. I have only had it about 6 months and I am already looking for a replacement."
3,Winsome Wood file review,This is a decent product. Takes quite a while to put together. Directions not the best - gives overall of how to put together but not a list of what to do first. I had to take a few pieces apart and start over. It also takes a bit of time to get the screws adjusted so the drawers slide properly. If the drawers are too tight - loosen the screws in that area until it slides properly. There's no bottom to the file drawer and the sides are open but functions as it should.I like it because it has the 3 pencil drawers (which is difficult to find on a file cabinet).I have it completely filled and haven't had any problems once it was set up.
2,Just ok.,"This item arrived promptly. I put it together and the back doesn't line up properly, this means that the whole thing doesn't really tighten up that well, when you try to tighten it the screws eventually strip. The screws for the knobs are not long enough so need to be glued. It is a cute piece and I have several others from this brand but this one was a bit disappointing."
2,file cabinet,"The quality was good. The directions to put it together was a nightmare, nothihg was labeled only a picture. I never expected the bottom drawer not to have a bottom, sides, or back! I expected at least one drawer to lock. If it werent so much trouble to take apart I would send it back! Maybe I can remake the bottom drawer and use it for something else. It wont work for a file cabinet for me."
5,Best Shampoo I've found to date,"I absolutely love this shampoo. Your hair will THANK YOU for it. It says use once a week, but that all depends on YOU. I have very long hair and use this 3 times a week. I am very particular with the products I put in my hair and I have to say, my hair has never felt better since finding this fantastic product. Highly recommend."
5,Best Shampoo,"This is really great shampoo. You don't use it everyday, but once a week or so. On the days I use it my hair has more bounce, shine, and never a bad hair day. It is an anti-residue shampoo, so it gets all your usual styling products (that build up after awhile) off your hair and gets it really clean. I color my hair regularly and I still use it. It doesn't strip the color at all. I have introduced many friends to it and they love it also."
5,Move Free Double Strength,"This is a great product. I like the fact that it doesn't contain anything other than the three active ingredients listed. Great service, great product. It helps prevent aching in the knee area. This product is impossible to find in the stores without other added ingredients. Glad to have a good supplier."
3,"horses, magic and wishes",Another title which seems to have been written early in her career. It is aimed at horse mad younger readers who like a bit of magic and fantasy. I enjoyed it even though i am out of the target market
4,A great short story,"Wishing for a horse for her son in time of war, when none can be bought, a mothers love opens her manor house to the people of her village, when most of the village has been shelled into rubble, even the pub!Cheers..............."
3,Want a quick run-through of ED facts?,"This book may not be as unique as others in the ""Recall"" series but is still worth getting. If you have Surgical or Medicine Recall"", many facts in this book are repetitions. But there is no point buying a huge comprehensive text if you're not going to read it. With this concise book that highlights what is most important, I have learnt more than many of my larger texts. It is very enjoyable to read and there is no need to scribble your own summaries."
2,Looks Pretty,"I received my comforter set a week ago and it looks so beautiful. I thought I was getting a great deal for buying the set at 70% off, but that isn't the case. The fabric on the inside of the comforter is rough and it doesn't retain much heat. The seams are sloppy and threads are fraying from the edges. I was expecting a high value product and am disappointed with the low quality."
2,Incovenient,This lock is inconvenient with other locks. It is supposed to lock by using the right hand to hook in the locker but this lock is designed for the left hand user(not for a normal right hand user).
2,ALIGNMENT BAR,just make sure that the lock is facing you (where you align the numbers)before you lock it or else you would have a hard timeopenning it because now the alignment bar is not facing you.
2,Kinda cheap,"The metal parts of the lock don't feel very heavy and give off a cheap feel to the lock. I wouldn't want to hack at it with a crowbar, but I don't think it would last long against it. The spinners are plastic so even if I couldn't break the lock I could probably pry those out and line up the big red marks on the metal tumblers.I saw them on It Takes a Thief, the show on Discovery Channel so I thought they were pretty good since they were using them to secure backyard gates. When I dropped it while the lock was open from putting it on my gate it hit the ground and just shattered. I had to find all the plastic spinners and the endcap hidden in the grass.The packaging suggests Master considers this to be a 3 out of 5 locks. I'd say it's more of a 2. While it may be harder to remember, using their conventional dial combination locks is probably a better value."
3,Does it's job but sometimes tough to unlock,"I like having the security of a Master Lock with the ability to change the combination. Although, I feel that it takes me longer now to turn the dials and unlock this device versus using the old, standard combination locks."
4,Easy to use,Good little lock easy to change. Haven't had anyone try to break into it so don't know how secure it is but it seems good and I love having all my combo locks have the same combo.
1,dont buy this,"Very disapointed with the product, as it does not meet OEM specs. The output is too strong, and may damage your console. The unit is very cheap also, as the prongs are both the same size and are very flimsy."
3,Time for a proper re-release,"I'm aching to buy this album, but when will CBS/Sony remaster this properly, with competant packaging to display the great artwork, and a decent mix. They re-issued a few former Japanese only releases (live album's like ""Dark Magus"") in 1997, but missed this and Agharta? The 25th anniversary of these recordings would have been a nice touch, but that's long gone now (this album was originally put onto CD 15 years ago!) Times have changed."
4,excellent 1975 concert,"Excellent 1975 concert. Don't approach it expecting the Miles Davis who recorded Kind of Blue or Sketches of Spain. This is dour, caustic, inscrutable music with heavy backbeats electric guitar.I shouldn't have written this. It's best to approach this music without preconceptions, because it might disappoint you. Then again it might not."
3,Am I crazy?,"I realize that this album has garnered many positive reviews. Please believe me, I love the 'electric Miles' period. I must say however; that this record is really not very good from the standpoint of wanting to hear Miles in top form. To tell the truth he sounds as if he's in alot of pain and his trumpet playing is difficult to hear in the murky sound. The release of ""It's About That Time"" was very welcome to me and that set eclipses this nice but droning set."
2,Sub-Par,"I bought this after reading the rave reviews, and boy, what a disappointment. The first disc starts out great, but by the end, just sort of peters out. I had to check the CD player to see if the disc was still playing, and there were about four minutes left. The second disc is pretty lifeless and directionless. I don't see the attraction."
5,Gemini Voodoo Man Meltdown,This is some of the greatest music ever released to the public. Buy it and melt your mind with it.
5,Like the title says: It is primal,"THis music is ancient and futuristic, perhaps ahead of its time in 2001 even. Loud funky, guitars from mars (pete cosey) guitar rythym that is brillant from Reggie Lucas, amazing sax and flute by sonny fortune. It is loud and crazy and soft and peaceful at the same time, it was the soundtrack for my longdistance bus journeys while travelling in South America last summer, Gondwana indeed...."
1,"For me, a disappointment.","I loved Waterhouse's book ""Outsmarting the Female Fat Cell"" and I was hoping to learn a lot from this one too. Unfortunately, this book was offering 8 commonly known strategies, like: destress your life - that's good - without more specific HOW's. An example; if you have three kids, a demanding job and an unhelpful husband, she'd like you to change your attitude, not particularly your life. Hello! I've learned all of her strategies and a lot more from magazines, such as Prevention, including more up-to-date facts. For instance, Waterhouse recommends kava-kava for sleeping. However, lately kava-kava has come into disrepute due to German medical studies. Also, I would have rather seen more information explaining WHY these 8 stragies work, rather than just the ""do-it's"", for instance: how hormones affect us, etc... as her other book did."
1,Too Scary!,"My Class Saw This Video But I Had A Test Lucky Me! The Other Kids Said They Would Not Be Scared Of This Video. We Did That Because Of The Fire That Happened In Alpine On Jan,2,2001. I Hate Having Nightmares That Is Why I'm Scared."
2,London Homesick Blues Live,"This isn't the London Homesick Blues I bought the cd for. It's some hammy version which includes the word ""dadgum.""Turns out the version I like is the one he sings on Jerry Jeff Walker's Viva Terlingua."
4,Old but fun,"This little gem is quite old. I think I got it about 7 years ago or something. But it's really quite fun. The storyline is pretty engaging, and it has a great sense of humor. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good time racing and battling with cars in alien worlds."
5,Verry nice!,"Looks good,fits nice. whenever i look at lingerie i try to see my wife and not the model , difficult but it can work.other than that,the delivery was prompt and quality is good ."
3,Basic lock but beware of simple keys,"This lock is pretty basic and gets the job done. The only issue is that the keys are VERY simple. I ordered 3 of these locks and although each lock had slightly different keys, each was VERY simplistic. Therefore, I wouldn't suggest this lock for anything that needs real security. We use them on our outdoor sheds mainly to deter. If someone wants to get in the sheds bad enough, they'll just cut through the plastic walls. So, for this usage, these locks are perfect."
5,GREAT!,Great price great product I will buy again when I need more. Amazon is always so fast. I love it
2,so tiny,"it's SO TINY. I bought it for my husband thinking it would be a good travel size. It's just like those little tubes they give out at store. But the cap pops off and you spill the whole thing on the counter so you pay a lot of money for one use. Looks like it's bigger because of the spray nozzle, but don't be fooled. This thing should only be free. Shame on Polo for trying to sell it as a product."
3,Polo Blue (2002),"This update to the original Polo Blue is very striking in my opinion. It stood out among the others I tested (Polo Black, Armani Code, etc). Its top notes are cucumber and tangerine, middle notes are geranium, bottom note is basil; it reminded me more of a newly water garden than of the ocean. Polo Blue has very cool, earthy and wet smell. I can see what they were going for, and this fragrance definitely stands out from the rest, but it was just to awkward for my taste."
5,Fabulous,"I LOVED it! I loved the parody and mix of old and new Star Trek characters (""Craptain Jirk"" talking to ""Craptain Pecanhead"", etc.). The artist also intersperces characters that the original Star Trek actors have played in other shows (Christopher Lloyd as Iggy on Taxi, Doc Brown of Back to the Future and Commander Kruge of Star Trek 3, etc.). The bit on Vulcan anatomy in the bathroom is very, very funny (I can't say more in this forum or you won't post it!...). I like the raunchy humor and goofy sound effects. The commercial parodies are also very funny and topical (there's a spoof on ""Scrotex""). I can't compare to any other CDs because I've never heard any even remotely like this. Every time I listen to Space Trak, I hear something new and laugh until my stomach hurts!"
3,Beware,"I was looking for ""Yeh Yeh! by Georgie Fame and noticed that this cd also had one of his other hits ""The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde"". It was very reasonably priced but these are not the same versions you remember from 60's radio. Actually, the version of Yeh Yeh! isn't that bad, it's just not what I was expecting."
5,"MUCH better than his previous ""C++"" work...","If at first you don't succeed...Sedgewick's first cut at ""Algorithms in C++"" was a sick joke; the code was often incorrect and very difficult for even an intermediate C programmer to follow. In addition, there was virtually no difference between the C and C++ algorithms. In fact, that's why I put C++ in quotes in the title -- calling it representative C++ code was an extreme stretch.It took several years, but Sedgewick has fixed that and has turned this work into one which better realizes its full potential. There is now a much stronger C++ and OOP flavor to the examples than there was before.In summary, whereas I feel the previous version is not worth seriously studying (at least not the examples), this one is extremely solid and worth a spot on the bookshelf for CS students and ""real-world"" C++ programmers alike.Call it the ballplayer who atones for his previous strike out by hitting a home run in his next time at bat."
5,good algorithm book for programmers,"This book delivers what it says on the title and nothing more; Fundamentals, data structures, sorting, and searching. In my opinion, the topics covered in this book are just perfect for beginners. Its not too much and not too little. This book does a very good of explaining the pros and cons of each algorithm, how they're implemented, and when they should be used. As far as Math. goes, this book doesn't deal a whole lot with it. It really is written for programmers."
5,One the best algorithms books I've seen,"As a software developer hungry to learn, I find myself sorting through a large number of computer books to find the well-written ones that are worth investing my time and money in. After reading and using Sedgewick's Algorithms in C++, I consider it to clearly be among the best books on this subject. I found the examples to be well-explained and easy to understand, with lots of practical source code ready to use in your programs. I look forward to reading the upcoming Java version as well."
3,good service,"Everything is good. Just I wouldn't call the book I received ""like new"" when you already had someone else' name on it. The paper package was also a little torn up when I received it in mail."
2,the writing of the book is not good,"The book always interprets each algorithm in English that cannot be easily understood. Sometime, after taking time to have understood the algorithm by myself, I found its english in this book is in a so a weird expression that even make the algorithm more confusing. At most time, the interpretation of some algorithm can be easier or more frank."
3,Comfortable Shoulder Rest,"I have played the violin for over 8 years and used a Kun original and super for all of it except the last couple months. Kuns are very comfortable but fall off quite easily. The grips also wear off exposing the plastic interior which scratches the violin. This is why I suggest buying a Viva. They are similar in design but the Viva has much better grips and stability. It won't come off unless you want it to. That's why I love them.I got my Viva at Ted Brown and due to varied preferences, I suggest that you try shoulder rests out, if you can, before you buy them."
3,Required for college class,I purchased this book for my college philosophy class. The book came in on time and in great condition. The reason I could not award more stars is that the book is just a compilation of other short readings which are all available online. Save your money and just google it!
3,Text book,"Fast Delivery, not the correct book, I needed the seventh edition but my fault. Talked to my instructor and he said I could still use it, the content is the same but the numbering of the pages is differant. So as long as I know what the content is to read I can find it. Turned out ok."
2,"Fascinating subject, poor writing","I have never met a book I did not finish even though I did not like it. Well, this book will be the first. The writing is drawn out, in this adoring (annoying) tone, references made to people and things without an explanation, constant jumping back and forth. And the sentences and paragraphs are so long. Could you not afford an editor? And who cares who Margot slept with or how she did it? Really...two stars only for the effort and the paper it was printed on."
5,balletomane essential,Massive but very readable balletomane essential in which we learn that her offstage life was as extraordinary as her onstage one.
2,All the gory details,"I was very disappointed in this book about the great Margot. Was it really necessary to put in all the salacious details of her sex life in order to give us a picture of her career and life? I think a little more restraint on the part of the author was definitely in order. I wanted to learn more about the ballerina's career on stage, not especially about what she did in bed and what her sexual prowess was. I agree with the lady who said she would not recommend this book to her daughter, the budding ballerina as I thought the 'so-called' sex information on La Fontaine was tasteless and over the top."
3,A waste of space,"The book if 400 pages long, partly because it takes 20 or so pages to describe what normally takes one page to describe. It is a waste of space. It could have gotten much more deep into trigonometry in the same number of pages that it used. It goes over the obvious a lot, and doesn't go over the more advanced things."
3,As is,"Wanted to buy for a case lock. The arm was too short.Items shipped quickly, price was great, found another use for the product."
1,Following the instruction on setting the combination was awkward and it did not work at all,There is a chance that I might have incorrectly tried to set the combination code. However I did follow the instruction that was a bit confusing. In the end the lock was stuck and I could not set the combination. Ended up returing this poorly made product and bought one with keys instead.
3,combo locks,The instructions as to how to set the combination are so vague one is left fumbling in the dark and guessing as to how to set the combination.
1,avoid,"Easily broken, garbage, avoid or you may have to go through the hassle of replacing your stolen valuables. Another American company that has lost its values. At least if they're going to keep costs low by producing easily broken locks the should provide insurance."
3,ok but broke,"These locks worked for a while then they both broke eventually after a while. I dont think they are worth the $11.00 I spent for them, but if you are a light traveler with light luggage then these are for you."
4,Ok locks...,"These are just for show. They lock and don't open without the combo but I highly doubt they will with stand anyone trying to break them open. I use these just to know if someone has been in my stuff, I don't kid my self it will stop someone that wants to get in bad enough."
1,Easily compromised,"We have many of these at the university that we use to seal computers instead of luggage. These are super easy to break into. If you lift the metal hook until it stops, you can literally ""feel"" the lock unlock when you switch to the right number (Starting from the bottom to the top). Bottom line is, these are fine when you have sight of your luggage or don't have anything too valuable in them. I wouldn't trust them for anything else. Also, with 10 minutes of free time, you can physically bend them until they break."
1,This is the worst combination lock I have ever purchased.,"This is the worst combination lock I have ever purchased.I bought three pairs of these locks. Setting the combination to a new value took a few tries with some. On a few of these locks, after setting a new value, and confirming the value was set, the lock would no longer unlock with the new combination."
4,Decent lock for the money,"The lock constuction is pretty flimsy and would work at best as a minor deterrent to a thief (I'm pretty sure you could break it with a hammer or even a large rock). I certainly wouldn't use these to lock up anything even moderately important to me.For the price though, you can't expect too much, these really were cheap, especially if you get free shipping from Amazon.I use these to lock my gym locker as it's enough to keep a casual guy walking by from rifling through my locker and in such a public place, I'm not too worried about someone taking a hammer to my lock.Recommended with reservations."
5,Works well,The locks work extremely well. Your personal combination is easy to set. The locks have good weight and slide open automatically when you complete entering the combination.
3,strictly for luggage - not real security,The locks are 2 pieces riveted together & could be easily broken open with a screwdriver. Their only real value is that in order to get into your luggage it would be obvious that the locks were broken. That would give you a basis for a complaint.
5,TSA approved is not always a good thing!,"These are excellent locks. Several people have noted not TSA approved, but every good hotel their has learned how to open the TSA approved locks. Yes that's what you need for checked luggage at the airport, but that's not what you want in your hotel room or if you've left your luggage with the porter. Outside of checking your bag with the airline you want one that is not TSA approved. That's why I bought these."
3,Reasonable value,"For the money, these locks are ok. I couldn't see how they were supposed to be opened by TSA which the description implied that they could be. However, for keeping the suitcase locked in a hotel room they work just fine."
1,Not TSA approved!,"I KNOW that when I ordered these last year that the description said they were TSA approved (it doesn't now). I just used two of them this month and had a rude awakening at the airport. They are NOT TSA approved. Unfortunately, because I've had them so long I can't return them. So I have six useless locks that I can't use for my luggage when flying. I won't buy from this vendor again."
3,They are locks,"OK they are luggage locks, Not a lot special about them, except the fact that you can set your own combination, that I do like. They are small luggage locks so they will fit on your laptop bags and your backpacks, if the zipper is made for a lock. They don't make me feel a 110% safe or any thing but they will keep the honest of thieves honest and make the not so honest of thieves work a little harder and maybe give you time to catch them. They are pretty solid and the dials feel sturdy and not all loose and flimsy like a lot of other combination locks I've seen with this type of dial. They definitely feel like Master Lock quality."
5,Perfect locks!,I love these locks. You can set your own code and you can change it with a simple process if you want to. The dials are super easy to turn and easy to read. These are perfect little locks.
5,Good locks for the price,"In the picture, the case looks like a hard plastic but the case is indeed a solid metal. Also the picture shows gold locks but you get silver. The shackle is nice and thin and easily locks my toolbox and camera bag. I'm very happy with the lock and will probably buy a few more. The price seems to fluctuate daily on this item by a $1 or $2."
5,An excellent all-around showcase for this creative pianist!,"This is a Tribute album - Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane & Mary Lou Williams are paid homage, I so much enjoy Jessica Williams' chops and enthusiasm, which spills over on the session; A playful, stride-style and a more contemplative side is also showcased throughout. This is a typical brilliant effort by Jessica Williams, and a great introduction to her music - Highly recommended!"
5,Great CD,I always liked this cd but really love it now because of the bouns tracks I have listened to it about 100 times since I got it. It came fast also
2,Tonight's not a good night!,"Sorry. This album did get bad reviews and I do agree, but I wouldn't give it one star. I liked a few songs, but I found this album rather boring. Thank God I borrowed it before decided to buy it, which I didn't do, because it would be a big waste of money. And for those who think 'Never Let Me Down' is bad, you'll hear worse when you hear 'Tonight', so don't bother."
2,Some good songs.,"""Loving the Alien"", ""God Only Knows"", ""Blue Jean"",and ""Tumble and Twirl"" are good songs. The rest leave a lot to be desired."
2,Avoid it like a Belgian chocolate truffle,"I went through an extended phase of denial after plonking this waste of digital recording space into my CD player. One theory was that Bryan Ferry and Robert Palmer had been somehow merged (a la 'The Fly') into one floppy-fringed, pleat-trousered hack by some evil scientist intending on cashing in on the AOR appeal of the newly-commercialised Bowie.But then the awful reality sank in. It really WAS him. And he was fully and solely responsible for inflicting this collection of unimaginative dross on the public.It took several spins of 'Diamond Dogs', 'Scary Monsters' and 'Heroes' before I felt all right again. And I now issue this government health warning to all unsuspecting consumers who are contemplating parting with their hard-earned $17.97: spend it on one of the other albums."
2,Not worth it.,"Concidering the alternatives, this just simply isn't worth it. Yes, perhaps if you already have the power adapter, all you need is this tip. But in order to use this with your laptop, you need the Y-adapter for an additional $30. There are just too many cheaper, less bulky ipod charging options out there. I just did not find this to be worth the price. However, it is well constructed and works fine."
1,Doesn't work on new Ipods,"This tip, in spite of Kensingtons claims to the contrary, does not work on new iPods. Tried it on two different iPods and neither will charge."
2,You can make this work with newer Apple devices,"As others have mentioned, out-of-the-box this adapter will not work with newer Apple devices (iPhone 3G, iPod Video, etc.). That's because the older devices used 12 volts, this adapter puts out 12V, and Apple switched to 5V(USB) power in newer devices. So, the iPhone tells you the charger is not designed to work with it...However, you can make it work, if you spend another $25 bucks or so. Scosche makes a small plug adapter that goes between this J3 and the iPhone or iPod, and reduces the voltage to 5V, which allows it to work with newer Apple devices. Just search for Scosche Passport on Amazon, and you will find it."
4,Film is overwhelming,"I don't know much about Noam Chomsky but did read an essay of his in university as part of course. I saw this recently in France at a film festival and the man and what he had to say blew my mind (I'm not exaggerating). Noam Chomsky tells an amazing story about how September 11th has changed America (and the world) in profound ways - the curtailing of freedom of speech, government crackdowns on opposition and dissenters, and the list goes on. Nice to have a film open your eyes for a change."
2,Barely Skims the Surface,"This movie on Chomsky isn't very unique or interesting. He is a brilliant man, and his books will obviously teach you more. A good dvd to check out is manufacturing consent - man. consent is almost three hours long, with a good structure that the movie follows, with more complete explanations of Chomsky's ideas. Rebel w/o a pause is a hastily put together film, which dedicates too little time to each current issue, i.e. the war in Iraq. Entertaining, but not a good source of information."
1,Yikes !,"A good example of what can happen when someone ventures outside his/her academic area. I feel bad knowing that, if this video is around in 100 years, Chomsky will only be remembered as a small time crank. I feel worse that his irrational musings have misled his fanboys."
1,"Noam Chomsky: Arrogant, egotistic socialist!",Noam Chomsky is one academic for which making a documentary about was a complete waste of time. Please! This socialist is the last person I would take seriously and is right down there with Bill Ayers and Michael Moore. Stop glorifying socialists! They're idiots!
1,Not really that good.......,"When I first saw this book and ordered it i was very excited to learn more about the intricies of macro trading. After reading about 1/2 of the book I could tell I just wasted $40. I found that the authors comparison of two different variables on 1 graph with 2 Y axis was statistically wrong. You cannot compare two different variables on absolute movement at all, espically when you are using two different scales on the same graph. Using this method of comparison sun-spots and the S&P500; have correlated. The correct way to do this is by comparing percentage movement of the two different variables. By doing this with my previos example there is no real correlation, jsut as one would think. I would assume that the same would occur for 1/2 of this books graphs.All in all, buy, Market-Neutral Investing : Long/Short Hedge Fund Strategies by Joseph G. Nicholas, You'll apperciate it alot more and it isn't flawed like the book on this page!"
4,Fans of Sunny Day Real Estate- get into this band,"This cd is great. I, being an insane fan of Sunny Day Real Estate, do think they sound pretty similar so of course I would like this ;-] This is something you could and should get into. Good stuff, guys."
2,galloping power metalers,"galloping power metalers, just with many faults. They have been highly hyped but quite frankly are old news. There are like iron madian but not as good, there singer Mario Linhares shriks to much on this albam his voice just screams on and on but over all tolerable but not recomended"
4,Raw...and Well Done!,"This is Weather Report at its edgiest! Their second CD is a powerhouse effort! Zawinul and Co. start us off with the brutal ""Unknown Soldier"" which for all its atonality ends up in G Major. ""The Moors"" features Paul Winter Consort/Oregon guitarist Ralph Towner playing as never before! ""Crystal"" takes us on an ethereal musical journey. As you listen, imagine yourself INSIDE the crystal as the light shines down, bringing out beautifully intense colors from its facets. ""Second Sunday In August"" has a religious feel to it. The ""Vertical Invader Medley"" kicks off the earblasting live half. ""Surucuccu"" features CTI flautist Hubert Laws. We end with an explosive re-working of ""Directions"". With I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC, Weather Report reaches heights never aspired to again."
3,"Sophomore still lacks a pivotal glue, but certainly compelling enough for fans","Weather Report's second outing does not rise much above the futile talent and aimless compositions that plagued the first release of achieving anything more then microcosms of conceptual brilliance. Here, the emotional aspects are still seriously downplayed, rarely treating us to anything more then the splattering of many creative ideas irresponsibly thrown together in an unconvincing whole. There is a bit more hint of cohesion lurking around, but by and large the groups insistence on overdoing every tiny space with eclectic, self conscious instrumentation still far outweighs the songs they seem focused on developing, as witnessed, thankfully, listening to the solidly foreshadowing final track."
3,2.5,"2.5 not because it's a bad album, it's not - it's a very good album. For one thing, live and studio combo does not work for me - it destroys the continuity. Second, it's not really the sound of Weather Report, there is nothing here that reminds me even remotely of Weather Report. Just very generic abstract, experimental, free-jazz-ish mudic (yes, mudic). Sort of like the Soft Machine at their most noodle-icious. To me the first album that sounds like Weather Report is Tail Spinnin'."
4,hug your skin but not constrictive,very light and good look and fit. Fit great in front and also in back but if you are not slim would get something else.
2,disapointed,this brief is not do in DOW XLA Fiber its just 95% cotton and 5% elasthan so its wrong !!!!
2,"Well done, but I still prefer the old standards","What I loved about Krall was her revival of the old standards with a great voice and excellent piano work. But, it appears she has left her jazz fans behind. Not one recognizable title on this album -- no standards here. But, she's entitled -- she must be tired of all the touring and repetitious playing -- it gets a little old after awhile. Now, she's in a new era and her music will reflect that. I guess it's time for her to move in new directions and I'm sure she will attract new fans. But, as an old jazz player myself, I will miss her jazz -- at least we have these great recordings, the best being her ""Live in Paris"" DVD. Onward and Onward."
2,Not my cup of tea.,"Oh, dear. After waiting what seems like an eternity for Diana's new studio CD, I hope that ""Temptation"" isn't an indication of what's on the rest of ""The Girl in the Other Room"". Often criticized for singing too many standards and too much glamorized packaging, Diana seems to have decided to ""get down"", and down this single is: not a great or even good song, and it's completely at odds with DK's intimate, honey-and-whiskey vocals. Far, far beneath her talents. Like others, I was semi-critical of ""The Look of Love"" as too romantic, glossy and generic. Had we known that this might contribute to DK's ""new direction"", we would have definitely kept our opinions to ourselves.Please, Diana, get back to the standards ASAP! I agree with another Amazon reviewer who suggested a Jobim-salute would be awesome."
2,Only two songs!,"I may be the only doofus who didn't know this, but there are only two songs on this CD! Love the sounds, but not at all worth the time and postage. Regret buying this album."
5,KRALL SPACE GRATIFIES!,"Diana Krall has always been - and will always be - at the top of her game. This ""SINGLE"" release only adds fuel to her fire. Great songs by a great singer. I Recently enjoyed her ""Girl in the Other Room"" concert appearance here, and encourage anybody who appreciates good jazz and great vocals to attend. Diana Krall can be appreciated by all, but especially by those who know greatness when they hear it (some don't, you know....can we spell ""tone-deaf"" boys and girls?) Whether on a single or an album or in concert, there's only ONE Diana Krall, and she BEATS all!!!"
2,Talking the Pain away... No!,"Yea as I wrote above.. ""Taking the pain away... No!""No as in.. just another way to stop the Chronically ill persons from ending their own lives. (Bad for Academia and society)Write out Journals? You have to be ""High"" on prescription pain killers to think that academic hazing rituals will help?!!!Reaching for the Placebo effect. Absolutely!.The talking cure does NOT work for Pain relief! Or Chronic Pain Relief.Total Academic BS. And this smells like something Edward L. Bernays would think up. (for the drug companies)GENE"
3,Cognitive therapy excellent but there is more to pain than thought errors.,"It is so very important to consider the 'errors in thinking' that this book delves into in regards to living with chronic pain. My main issue with this, or any book like it, is that it helps perpetrate the myth that a change in our thinking is what is needed to get many of us to have less pain. If we have trigeminal neuralgia, like I do, or RSD, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, etc, it definitely is worthwhile to look at how our thinking habits may make us less able but it is not enough.If you want to know what it is like to live with daily pain, you might want to read A PAINED LIFE, a chronic pain journey.A Pained Life."
3,"Good info, dry speaker","I agree that there is a lot of good information provided in this DVD. Unfortunately, the speaker is not very dynamic at all. In fact, you can watch his eyes go back and forth as he reads the tele-type machine or whatever he is reading from.Again, it is good info but if you are looking for something that will really engage an audience, in my opinion this isn't it. (I'm still searching!)"
4,A Well-Balanced Discussion Based on Evidence,"Stamm is as willing to decry the school of mule fanciers who can see no faults in the animal as horse people who ignore the mule's existence. The book was put together to help a rider decide which animal best suits his or her individual usage, but it has a more important historical result. With his vast collection of quotes from all first-person journals and reports, he demolishes our usually distorted view of the mule in the West as an animal only for the poor or eccentric -- the beasts normally cost 50% more than horses, and was usually in short supply! I recommend this book to anyone researching the West, researching equid use, or looking for a mount surefooted enough to follow the worst deer tracks in the high mountains and tough enough to do it all day for a week."
2,Hisyorical,I thought I would get more information with respect to the handling of mules. Instead it is a compelation of stories from people who have owned mules at various times in the historical past.
5,very important transitional lp,"From 1968, ""Filles de Kilmanjaro"" ... Miles in a familiar position- that of a restless musician who is shedding old skin and exposing himself while the new skin grows.The band is in flux- Herbie Hancock and Ron Carter are leaving the group,(though Hancock will reocrd with Miles again) and Tony Williams is starting to form his pioneering fusion group, Lifetime. Miles and Shorter are both writing new tunes at a frantic pace, and both are spreading the barriers of the band to electric sounds (which is increasingly isolating Ron Carter, who dislikes the electric concept).This lp showcases the last of the old quintet, and the metamorphisis, with Dave Holland and Chick Corea, to the new, experimental band that will blossom on ""In a Silent Way.""The reocrdings need to be listened to to gain its full beauty, its power and grace. And its importance. A gorgeous lp."
3,Sound IS listenable!,While the sound on this cd surely isn't the best it most defiantely is not as bad as the former reviewer's complaint.With afew tweaks of a fairly decent equalizer there is MUCH enjoyable listening to be had on this cd especially if you are a lover of brass band music as I am.The price is very reasonable and I feel worth the money.
3,Do NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF FRAGILE JUNK!!!,"THE PSP IS WAY TO FRAGILE AND WILL BREAK EASILY, SO Y SPEND LIKE $$$46583 ON IT FOR NO REASON. I HAVE A DS AND IT IS NOT EVEN A LITTLE FRAGILE. SO OVERALL THE PSP COST 2 MUCH. I COULD GET AN XBOX AND A GAME FOR EVEN LESS THEN THE PRICE OF ONE PSP!!!!"
2,That's just wierd?,On March 31st 2005 I heard something on CNN.com saying that sony is going to delay the PSP until june 2005. I mean i've been reading in Newspaper articles saying it was coming out in March (which it already is and I think it's cool) but the main thing is that Sony may delay the Playstation Portable! And I do not know why they are doing this?
3,I wouldn't waste my money....,"I'm a huge Nintendo fan, and although I have been doubting the PSP practically since I saw a way different looking blue print of it in a magazine, I have to say, it actually looks a little interesting.Like I already said, I'm a Nintendo fan, wich means, I probobly won't buy the PSP. [...] Nintendo's been around for a long, long time, and their products are something everyone can trust.I hear about busted PS2's all the time.The console looks cool, the screen is big, and the graphics are mind blowing.I know the PSP can do a lot of things the DS can't and the DS can do a lot of things the PSP can't.I think that Sony could've done a lot more better at the PSP's design though.I mean come on, the screen is perfectly exposed to being scratched.They could've at least added a clam shell design to it.Yeah, I know I won't shut up about Nintendo, but this is just something to compare them to.[...]"
1,crappiest thing ever,"oh COME ON!! this thing has stupid dead pixels!the motor is noisy!what else!I would rather get a ds other than this crappy thing!Hey at least the nintendo ds has a freakin longer battery life!personnaly i like the ds better.the psp does have better graphics,but WHO CARES i like nintendo better becuase they INNOVATE!i dont care about stupid graphics or features!i already have an ipod and portable dvd player!why settle watching a movie on some little ass screen with muffy sound?i care about gameplay.not some fancy graphics!"
2,"Not for me, probaly not even for you....","I am givin this 2 stars cuz i am impressed by all the technoligy and effort they put in it. BUT i have 2 portable dvd players and i have an ipod which both r WAYMORE better than the psp mp3 and dvd. anyway i would have bout it if it were 75 bucks cheaper.ANYWAY IF U GIVE IT TO A 10 OR 11 YEAR OLD HE/SHE WILL BUST IT IN 10 MONTHS(max). WHY WASTE MONEY ON A FREAKIN EXPENSIVE GADGET THAT WILL BRAKE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER??!!!??? I AM NOT A FREAKIN NINTENDO FANBOY BUT U CAN PUT THE MONEY FOR A DS,GAMEBOY SP,XBOX,PS2, OR WAIT TILL A NEW SYSTEM COMES OUT NEXT YEAR LIKE THE XBOX2, PS3, OR THE NINTENDO REVOLUTION. IF UR SMART U WILL LISTEN AND SAVE UR MONEY. ANYWAY BARLEY ANY OF MY FREINDS HAVE PSP SO WHO AM I GONA PLAY WITH???!!!???? TRUST ME MY 2 FRIENDS THAT HAVE TH PSP R BOTH HAVIN TROUBLE WITH IT."
5,Web Browser is AMAZING,"I bought a PSP in early July, but now that they have the web browser you can get the real internet on the PSP. Surfing the web is just about as fast as broadband. Its not nearly as slow as the hand held phones that get the internet, the PSP web is really fast for a small device. Now I will carry my PSP most places that Ill go cuz I can search the internet where ever I am."
4,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The psp is great. i bought it the first day it came out. The movies are great it's just like a theatre.The 3 bad things are 1. You dont get enough capacity(only 32 megabytes)2.It's about 11 ounces which is way to heavy to keep in your pants and 3 the 1 GB is $150. For music a music player buy a zen micro or an apple mini.
4,game trouble,"I bought the psp for the graphics and compact size. When I started playing it when I got home there was something wrong with it. As i was playing tony hawk under ground 2 remix. I was almost done with the 4th levle it was saying do you want to quit the game and i keep saying no, it became a problim! So from time to time i have to keep saying no. Well I hope it doesn't do that with the movies.From,Kevin"
5,"Brilliant graphics, brilliant everything!","This is the best gadget i have seen in a long time.For a start, the graphics are just as good as the normal ps2 and you can get just as many games.The internet access on it is fine, as long as your not planning to travel great distances with it, as this will not work beacuase of the wi-fi radius.When looking at pictures ect on the internet, the quality is amazing for such a handheld device, and it is quick and easy to load.I havent yet tried the UMD movies, but going on the quality of the other features, I'm sure it will be fine.All in all this is a brillian tpeice of equipmednt and i would strongly reccomend it to anyone with the right amount of money!Fantastic!"
2,Cha-ching!,"I have recently bought one of these, and it is very fun, but i simply cannot justify spending at least $250 and about $40 a game for my videogames. Personaly, i would buy something cheaper like a ds and take the extra 120$ and buy and ipod!"
1,dude this gameboy ripoff from sony is awful,never get the psp. i hate it. i get cramps evry time i use the analogg stick. ds is way better. i think warrior ing may be right. im now a regular nintendo custumer.
3,"This is pretty good, I exspected better","I got this for christmas and was excited,but when you play the same game it gets boring.The movies on it are good for long road trips.But there is this junk that sometimes for about a week that scews up the sceen.And if you get a game with relly good graphics,the sceen might slow down or mabey freeze.But don't get me wrong,it's a good system.But dowloading things from enternet is hard.Games i request are battlefront2,or spider man2.The battery life is about 4 hours."
1,Poor performance!,"I don't understand why but the UMD movies look horrible on the PSP. Think of them as tiny DVD's that don't look quite as good. There is major pixelation on some of the movies, and it is very noticeable. I'm usually not too picky, but c'mon, for a $30 dollar movie, I expect it to look a little better.Not recommended"
2,Rod Langburg is INCORRECT...,"Contrary to what he may have stated, a PSP cannot hold more music than an iPod...unless you buy anywhere from 4-60 1 GB memory cards...just a single 1 GB card costs about $150...whereas an iPod price ranges from $99 - $449. So, YOU do the math. Don't let someone else do it for you.If you plan on purchasing a PSP for music and photos - don't. get a 40 or 60 GB iPod Photo.I have seen a DS in action as well as a PSP...you won't hear from me that one is better than the other...buy the one that you like or want...make you own decisions, America!Up to $50 for ONE PSP game?! Be careful what people say...the graphics in a PSP are COMPARABLE to a PS2, not equal or necessarily better...of course it will vary from game to game.I don't mention the DS game prices because I imagine that they remain around the $29-$39 range, not to mention that it is a less powerful system than the PSP."
5,GOOD NICE AND I NEED ONE OF IT OK.,THIS IS GOOD AND IT IS ATTRATIVE tO BUY OK KOOL AND NICE THANKS.pls any one who want to sale any psp for me bcos i am intrested in buying it ok so the person to mail me [...] ok i need one psp for my child here in nigeria ok bye.
1,Ahhh! It burns!!!,[...]PSP lack of choices for the games and they are to diffucult for children to understand! There voilent too! [...]
1,bug,"O.K. so PSP may have multi-media capabilties but really, what do i need the integrated DVD and mp3 players for if i already have a DVD player and an ipod? If I ever got one all i'd use it for is to play games. Thats why I got a DS, because all i need are the game playing capabilities. I dont need a DVD player. Thats one of the bad things about sony, they put loads of extra crap on the stuff they make so they can charge more. Thats just to say I'd get a PSP if it just played games and didn't have extra junk (the multi-media players) on it."
2,WHY?,"I guess the psp is ok, if you enjoy dead pixels. try playing nfs underground rivals with a little white dot in the middle of the screen. i guarantee that you will be focusing on the dot instead of the road and crash into walls and stuff. oh and sony says it's common with lcd screens but my nintendo ds lcd screen has no dead pixels. i was thinking about exchanging my psp for one that doesn't have dead pixels but i have heard people complaining that even when you exchange one you have a high chance of having the same problem. STICK WITH A DS!"
1,False Adverstisment,This is a broken dirty game with missing pieces. It does not work. You have to pay someone to fix it. You might as well just buy one new. Mine was for a birthday gift. How dissapointing. I tried going to youtube and downloading all of these different progams to unbrick it. Wast of time.
2,Complete waste of money,This is another joke of a gaming system by Sony. They are even advertising its other features (videos and music) over the games! Now I'm not a DS fanboy. I also think that is a waste of money. The best handheld gaming system is the GBA:SP hands down. Buy that instead. Its status as #1 won't be taken any time soon.
1,yoshi is the best,Why would you get this crap any thing that that doesn't have yoshi why get it. PSP is so stupid none of psp fans know how to spell.
2,"Fragile, VERY Fragile","I don't own one but my friend got a brand new one and she played it for 5 minute then it fell apart when she squeezed it a little. So if you buy one of these terribly expensive things DO NOT TOUCH IT,or at least don't get one"
1,"lol, it's ok to be mad, just don't make up stories","""Nintendo got outdone by Sony yet again."" Blatant lie. the DS is the #1 selling console in Japan and other markets for 5 months straight now. I understand that Sony fans are upset by the fact that the DS is outselling the PSP big time around the world, but don't make up blatant lies and ficticious stories. Keep it real.Oh yeah, and my PSP had only 1 dead pixel... I guess that is good? I still returned it."
2,"""Walkman of the 21st century"".......you must mean DS","This is a very nifty little device. I'll just list pro's and cons for it.Pro's:1. Very slick design.2. Ability to play MP3's and DVD's.3. Nice screen and layout.4. Incredible graphics.Con's:1. Screen is not durable, and can break under pressure.2. You need memory sticks ($90 for 512 MB) to save anything.3. You can't use DVD's for it, you need UMD disks.4. Although sleek, easily smudgable.5. Price could be lower.6. Battery life is poor. Spiderman 2, which is about and hour and a half long, uses about half of the battery, so you'll need a spare battery for long trips.Buy it if you can fish out lots of money, but if not, go get a Nintendo DS, much better battery life, low price considering it's technology, and also, it a very innovative touch-screen that is just a pleasure to use."
1,Not good,"Too expensive and not enough games. Sure there are a few that might be fun, but they are not fun for very long. Not recommended."
1,...,HORRIBLE GAMES JUST HORRIBLE! the graphics did impress me at first but the games i bought was just plain boring and made me want to throw it against the wall!
1,$250 + $50 in required accessories + poor selection of games and movies = bad,"These are the main reasons to not buy a PSP. It is just too much money and you don't get your moneys worth out of it. Oh, and everyone who says the sound quality is horrible without headphones is 100% correct. It has a very nasty ""laptop"" style speaker sound when you play movies and it is really hard to enjoy them on the PSP. If you get headphones it makes it alright, but still the sound is nothing special."
4,Stop it....,"I am 11 years old.I dont own this but theres something i need to write after reading some reviews.I know people have write to speak there mind but stop fighting over the best game players.Both can be good.Even if you think the psp is a waste because its wasting money.It may not be my opinion is psp is good for me because i have the money for it and i like all the features.I am not buying it for games really.The DS may be good for you because you can afford it and you want to play games more then playing with mp3 players,web browsing,and all that other stuff.So what i am really saying just stop fighting over baby stuff gosh somebodys has to say it."
2,PSP,"[...] I didn'tenjoy the experience. The graphics are good, the screen scratches, the speakers suck, the movies are too dificult to see (the screen is too small) and the photo viewer is pointless. WHY WOULD YOU USE AN INTERNET BROWSER ON YOUR PSP IF YOU HAVE TO BE WITHIN A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM A REAL COMPUTER? I think everything sold seperately is way too expensive. [...]"
2,PSP :(,"Bought a psp it came with 19 missing pixels and the analog fell apart instantly scrathes on my screen and now its broken from a small drop, not worth the money too fragile otherwise a good console save up for the next generation consoles."
1,second one with dead pix,"i have 2 laptops that i have had for years, my son beats on the screen and still no dead pixs. what is up sony? This is the second psp that i have got with the same problem. And to top it off today the screen has changed colors it went from a normal green background to a pink. Now maybe you can change the background color but i am not sure. if you can change the color why did it change by itself. I paid for a product that is supost to work."
1,What a Piece of Garbage,"I just recived my psp yesterday from ups. After just one hour of playing Twisted Metal Head-On, there it was A DEAD PIXEL right in the middle of my screen. I am very mad at Sony for making such a worthless piece of junk and overpricing it by 250 dollars."
1,Sound is garbage,"You would think with such a great screen there would be great speakers, but you're wrong. The sound is worse than a laptop speaker, and it makes watching movies on it pointless."
1,4 dead pixels,"The screen is great if you can manage to see past the dead pixels. I mean, 4 dead pixels right out of the box? How could that happen? Sony has some bugs to work out in the manufacturing plant."
3,I bought this thing for games.....,"...and I did not get them,I got 3,and not really fond of any of them,and I have 13 DS games,So I guess i'm more intersted in what the DS has got....Man,if this thing couldn't do anything but play games,it would not last long,but it has many different features and is really great if your Tech savyI am returning my PSP and all it's stuff for $150,it just didn't satisfy my need for games....think before you buy it,will you use all of its features? If so,go for it,if you are looking for games,there's always Mario Kart DS..."
2,PSP AKA THE PLAYSTAITION PORTABLE,"Hello,Im just a another person who purchased the psp.Well it did'nt go the way I expected it to go,first of all I own a mp3,I have tons of movies,and I dont want to watch movies movies on a little screen,why do that when you an watch movies on a laptop?I just think that the psp is for teens,but the ds is for anyone,and dont call me a nintendo fanboy,but when it comes tomore exciting,fun and cool games I think nintendo owns in that area.So I got a ds and traded my psp in and got some cool games.Those games are,mario kart ds,and animal crossing and like ton of people are saying both games are addictive!Im sure its more games like that for the ds!Was this helpful?"
1,The PSP is the worst handheld game system ever invented.,"Okay, listen up. The PSP may be able to play movies and download music. But if you think about it, which one is really the better system? The PSP or the DS? Well, does the PSP have two screens? NO! Does the PSP have a touch screen? NO! Does the PSP have WiFi capability? NO! The PSP requires a memory card to hold all of the games, but the DS stores memory on each individual game cartridge. If you feel like wasting your money on a piece of crap, then get a PSP. If you want a valuable, low priced, efficient game system, then get a DS."
2,Innovation?,"now, this is not much of a review for the psp. In fact I don't own one. My only comment is the ""kids"" review on the first page claiming that the Nintendo DS looks as a cardboard box. I know that this is an opinion and everything, but sure the psp looks sleek. I totally agree. It has good games too. But looks do not make a system. would someone please tell me what is innovative about the psp?! don't tell me good looks-that does not apply to the gamelpay. Innovation is key in this new step of gaming and the psp runs dry."
1,PSP is a huge waste !,"PSP is a piece of junk! It arrives with dead pixels right out of the box, the screen gets scratched almost immediately, and dropping it ever so slightly destroys the thing! I knew the Nintendo DS was more durable and had better games... why did I even consider this thing? This is just like the new PS2 design that stops working after 6 months due to inferior chipsets. I'm done with Sony products."
4,Why Dont They Go All the Way,"I bought a Japan version of this last December. It is a very cool piece of gear no doubt about it. However, once again sony seem to be missing the boat. This would have been a knock out if they had designed it to allow seemless and simple transfer of video. They should have also designed it to accept flash memory. If Archos can do it why can't Sony. The idea that we are all going to start buying UMDs as the primary medium for video content is something dreamed up by some pencil pusher in accounting. Morevover, the idea that I am going to buy memory sticks for all of my media content is similarly displaced.Accordingly I am giving this a 4 on the basis of its design as aportable gaming platform.PS: I have looked at the posts on various hacks to get PSP to do things that SONY should have designed into the unit. Their design team should take a look at this and learn what people want."
4,"good system, but not for kids","The PSP has an excellent screen. My hands are medium sized( relative to work out glove medium) It is somewhat difficult to race using the analog stick and the shoulder buttons. So I would say that anyone with small hands would have a difficult time using the psp and thats not taking into the consideration the weight of the unit. It is heavier than other handhelds. First couple things you need to buy when you buy the psp is:1. screen protector. like those pda screen protectors2. case for the psp3. case coverings for the umd games you buy4. the pelican carrying case that holds the psp, games, buds, charger. etc is nice.5. a bigger mem stick, if you plan just to save games, 128-256 is fine. if you want to put movies and mp3s, 512-1gb. 1gb recommended if you can find it.6. usb a-b cord to transfer files to and from the psp.the pelican starter pack is great since it has most of the things you need to start off. good combo with the psp."
4,"very satisfying, but not as good as it could be","It seems that the PSP is not a flash in the pan. There's a lot more games than there were before - several RPG's, 2 fight games, stuff for kids and stuff for adults.Unlike the Gameboy, some of the games out there are actually geared at adults.ok, it's bigger, so it's more hassle to carry than the GB micro, but the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. it's got WiFi access, memory stick, MP3, loads of available movies (and several programs out there that let you transfer your DVD's to PSP files).the only real drawbacks I see with it right now are that Sony isnt taking advantage of it's memory card to make downloadable games available and the battery - the battery life isnt nearly long enough - if you're a constant user like me you'll have to recharge at least once a day.hopefully we'll see a PSP2 sometime - it's got a ways to go."
5,Now that's portable gaming!!,"Wow, after years of looking at gameboys and spawns of that handheld I was shocked to see the graphics and gameplay of the PSP. And then add watching full length movies ... I just had to have it!The screen looks great and the graphics are awesome. Just like playing on a plasma screen TV. Since the PSP is fairly new there is only a limited amount of games and movies, but their is enought out of each genre to have something for everyone. (Except the movies, they are currently all action/thrillers)After buying the PSP (which currently comes with the movie Spider-Man 2) you should be ready to pay anywhere from $25 to $50 for games, and $15 to $30 for movies.Other accessories that will be needed may include: a carrying case, car charger, and a larger memory chip to hold pics, mp3s or other computer files that are accessible through a USB cable.All-in-all a must for any gamer. Enjoy!"
1,Sad but true,"The poster who said that the movies are not that great is 100% right. I expected this crystal clear video but it is more like watching a movie on the laptop. There are pixelation problems here and there, and although it doesn't make me pull my hair out, it is discouraging that the psp hardware is $250, and the movies are like $25-30 bux each, which is actually more than DVDs. Plus the games so far are lackluster at best. Save your money for a better system."
5,Sony (again) beats PSP!!!,"The PSP is so much better then the DS (duh). The PSP has got more features then the DS.Sony PSP- Watch Movies- Play Music- Lots of games- Save Photos- 4.3 inch screenNintendo DS- Duel screens- Touch screenWinner: PSPOnce again, Sony beats Nintendo. Go buy the PSP for $249.99 ($ 275 if including tax)."
2,No touch screen?,I wanted the PSP since there are a lot of first person shooters being released but I wished they used a touch screen because I think it would be easier to control a first person shooter that way like on the Nintendo DS.
5,buy one from eBay cheaper if you don`t like the price...,"Its free to sign with eBay and you can get even NEW Sony PSP consoles cheap-But even though the price look like a steal, check all the details and the full p&p; price and its still good value GRAB IT!Oh and even if they do rip u off-you can get ure money back so really there ain`t nothin to lose!-U may think ""Old News"" but its still TRUE-AIN`T IT??????????????!!!!!!!!!!!Oh check past feedback aswell.-----------------------------------------------------------------MY FAVERITE TNA/WWE WRESTLERZAJ Styles,Randy Orton,John Cena,Batista,Brock Lesnar,Eddie Guerrero(RIP),Chris Benoit,Chris Daniels,Christian Cage(now TNA)."
1,Bad bad bad,"Unless you like systems that get damaged right out of the box, due to dead pixels, don't buy this thing. it is just too fragile to be a useful gaming system. Either buy something more durable, like the DS, or save your money for the next gen consoles. Pick either ps3, xbox360, or N Revolution. Your choice, of course, just make sure you stay away from the PSP. It's not worth the $$$"
5,read this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i wanted to say that i have not yet goten a game for my psp yet but because i did not have enough money.i herd that the prices would rise so i got one.i saw the exellent graphics on the included sample disc and watched spider man and i sead to myself......""fun!!!!!""belive me the grafics are soooooooooooo much better than the ds,i mean comparing them is like comparing a cadilack to a ferrari!!!!trust me,get it.....please!"
1,"""Value pack"" yeah right","How dare they say that $250 is a ""value"". I'd rather just save up my money for a PS3, it won't be that much more expensive than a PSP. The PSP just isn't worth it. Maybe if it was less than $150 it would be worth it, but $250? Come on. I already have an IPOD so I don't care about playing MP3's, and I own a DVD player, so I don't need to run out and buy UMD movies just so I can watch it on the PSP. I think the idea of UMD movies are a total waste, considering that they don't play on anything but the PSP. The PSP should have been able to play DVD's, then it would have been a great system. Oh well. Hopefully the PS3 will be better than this sorry excuse for a handheld."
1,psp suuuuuckssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"oh my god! i had one on cristhmas and broke up. later, NINE of them i had broke up for several reasons that you can read on older reviews. i bought a ds, its AMAZING!!!!!!!!! please don't be fooled by psp graphics and multimedia, and buy a ds. besides, all the people i know ( even adults ) who own a psp, had to change their sistem, twice!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The best system ever to hit the street yet,to start off i dont have a PSP. My friend has one and the graphics are awseme. don't be fooled by DS's touch screen. imagine this if you have two computers and you have to work using both of them how do you expect to do that. I've heard that PS3 is coming out in Spring 2006 and you can use your PSP as a controller for it so you can take your PS3 and PSP to a friend who doesn't have a TV and still use a PS3. I have an SP and PSP beats it up and any other portable system by nintendo. So i reccomend you get a PSP while they're still on the market. The games i could see way better ones coming out in the future so if you brought a DS make sure you still have your reciept. And I reccommend a PSP to a responsible kid who doesn't smash up their toys on the first day they got them. hope this helped you on what to get and if you have dead pixels return and go to Best buy or Cicuit city and get one thy're much better they're.
5,Soooo Cool!!!^_^,"the psp rox!!!! the screen iz so huge like a plasma screen!mine has no dead pixels...o.Oit's so cool buy it!^_^but the price iz too high there is one memory stick thats $150.00!thats the cost of a ds!!!=O^-^Starfishie""Star""^_~"
5,Amazing wow,well im not a kid just i dont want to give away my email. this thing is so cool. it is like a plasma tv in my pocket! it dosnt come with alot of memory at first but you can buy more later for pretty good prices on amazon. the games rock. must haves are ssx on tour and wipeout pure. this thing is awesome. it is pretty easy to download everything to it. i love it!!!
1,crap,None of the accessories were included the PSP was In bad condition broken controller piece and a bulging bad battery returned it as soon as it came
1,Stupid Discs!,The new PSP is more powerful than the DS but it uses discs that can get scratched easily and its harder to hold on to a bunch of discs than cartridges. Another important thing is that if you shake or even move the PSP slightly the spinning disc will be disrupted and you could get corrupted data. The disc also uses a lot of battery power with a laser reading it resulting in lower battery life. The DS is better with cartridges and almost instaneous loading time while on a PSP the discs take a long time to load. All this is true.
2,I wish they had 2.5 stars..........,"If you want to buy this CRUD, don't!!!! If you are buying it beacause of its DVD player thing, buy a portable DVD. They have bigger screens and richer sound!!Buy A NINTENDO DS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)They are much better.They cost MUCH, MUCH less, too!!!!!!!!!!!Save your hard-earned $$$$$ for something you really want.Now, if this is something you REALLY, MUST HAVE, go for it.It is OK if you buy it, but save your $$$ on a DS. Save about $200 on a DS.Buy it if you wantthank you"
2,Size,"Okay for the people who say about the ds, ""Why do people even call the ds portable. Look how big it is."" Well just look at the psp. It isn't any smaller than the ds and it might even be bulker. SO don't say the ds is to big wait for the psp. It is the same size."
1,Playstation Portable Is...fun?,"I was previously an owner of one of these expensive pieces of hardware.There are many issues with this handheld during my experience, which led me to sell it on ebay:1. collects fingerprints easily2. screen gets scratched fast3. too many dead pixels4. dust under the screen5. memory sticks too small for music and games6. small selection of games and movies7. light glare on screen8. volume is poor without headphones9. movies are hard to see on small screen10. games, accessories, and movies + PSP are too expensiveI finally decided to wait for the Xbox 360 PS3 and while it is going to be more expensive, it will have more games and features withhigh definition display. Do not waste your money on this copy of the Playstation 2. It is the same console in a smaller size and CAN'T play Ps2 games Save your money and get a good NEXT-GEN console that will be in better quality."
1,Dont get the Value Pack,DONT GET THE VALUE PACK!!!All the extra items you get in the value pack is not worth the money. The memory card is too small and you're most likely going to get a new one with a larger capacity. The headphones are cheap and will not last more than a month. You are most likely going to get a new carrying case for your PSP also. It is not worth the extra $60.
3,"it's okay,but there is a better solution.","i'd admit that i'm a nintendo fan,and i'm not dissing sony,but there is a better solution.im 12 years old but believe me,if you already own a PS2,just buy a screen for it!its a hundred dollars cheaper.you can play all the games,movies,and music you want.the psp is just smaller and portable,big whoop.this is the smarter choice.don't belive me?waste your money,i dont care,but its the smarter choice.merry christmas!:)"
3,psp,ill have you know that the kid who wrote about the gameboy pocket is slightly retarded. so dont make fun of him!
1,WHAT A SPAM!,"I hate the psp! I spent 300$ on this game system for what? half a screen of dead pixels,a stuck square button, and stuck umds in the slot. I bought a 50$ movie from lik-sang and played it on the psp. For 2 hours, i coudnt hear anything but muffled voices. In 2 hours, the movie was over. I spent 50$ for a silent movie!!! For all you people out there wanteing to buy the psp for its audio/video purposes, STOP! Consider buying a DS or PS2 if you like gameplay."
1,This is HORRIBLE,"This thing is so fragile, you can break it just by pulling it out of its box! I wish I was kidding, but I got a japanese import and it broke when I tried to use it. $800 later, I got another one that held together, but was disappointed. With good graphics but horrible gameplay, this thing just feels like an empty rip-off."
2,"Surprise, no hard drive",Would be a must buy if it had a hard drive. Who wants to pay $130 for the memory sticks.
5,GODLY GREATNESS!!!!!!!!!!,"First of all...This system is god!!!!!!!Im sure thewrte are the wackos that think the Ds os good well i got news for you IT ISNT!!!!!!!!PSP has movies, music, and games and............other suff!!!!it just rocks!and now for some true facts:PSP is godDS sucksend of that."
2,Smart yet stupid,PSP is too over rated. the price is too much. I admit thatit is cool but DS is better......................one morebit of advise to all ..... DON'T BRING IT TO SCHOOL!!!!
2,For those of you waivering to buy one-,"I don't hate the playstation and love Nintendo, its not like that anymore. Neither are worthwhile, and if you are deciding on getting one of these, then you don't want one.I used to always play video games, until I needed to buckle down and get serious with my studies. The truth is, these games give you instant gratification. But other things in life are much more important than the PSP or even DS. It's not worth the time or money (believe me its a lot of money spend on these games).I was hesitant to buy a PSP when I heard of its launch, and at that time I was in a hiatus of playing games. I couldn't decide for the longest time. I realized that I didn't need the PSP then, and it would only be a big distraction. Look at the bigger picture of life before you decide to buy this.Again, if you can't decide, you probably will be better off without it."
1,"Good item, but one major flaw makes this a 1 star.","I am actually 30, but that's not important. Everything about this console is nice, except that once your 32 MG memory stick runs out of memory you would probably want a 512 MG or something like that. Just save a $100. Sony knows how to take some of your $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. Get (...) Plus to all of you people don't buy a PS3 or PSP, SONY WILL PROBABLY MAKE PS4, or a PSP2. These sony fanboys can't wait they have to get their crap now. For the few people who actually waited for a ps3 instead of getting a ps2, good for you. Sony is the worst game company ever. (...)"
1,Powerful systems are not always better!,"With better graphics and processing power, this thing is more powerful than DS but it is full of flaws and dissapointments. First the large screen, its good but theres no clamshell design to protect it so it will get full of fingerprints and scratches. Using discs require a laser that uses a lot of battery power so the battery will go out quickly. The price is also outrageous!!! $250 and some places selling for $400+!!!!! I hope this review will help you make the decision to which system (DS or PSP) to buy."
4,PSP,"I like the hand-held plasma movie viewer. I only have one game and one movie sofar, but it is pretty cool and I plan on buying more cause its portable."
3,Great handheld but......,"Sony has a great handheld system but I heard of alll the problemswith it. I like Sony products but I heard of dead pixels, jammed buttons, and the price. For 250-520$ thats expensive ****, but its great. For thoes who have it and it works good for you. It plays movies, music, holds photos and plays games. I don't have a PSP but i'll get one once all of these problems are fixed."
4,I HATE PEPOLE DOWNING A DS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This thing is cool and i would like to have one....But COME ON!!!!WHY DO PSP FANS HATE THE DS???????IF YOU ASK ME, THE WAR BETWEEN DS AND PSP HAS TO STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BOTH SYSTEMS ARE GREAT!!!!!STOP THE WAR, PLEASE!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Its, OK... just another...","This thing is OK, graphics are nice and the bigger screen is a plus, but if you ask me its just another portable handheld game clone!!With a couple of extra features...Nothing to get worked-up about. Some people say this unit will compete with the IPOD (NEVER) not a chance, thats what I say to that! I give this thing about 6 months and nobody will be even talking about it anymore."
5,NOT ALLL WHAT IT SEEMS MUCH MUCH MORE!!!!!,"The PSP is a really exciting thing it has a very unique and elegant playstation look .Here are some cool stuff about that u dont realise:1-The PSP Is Like a portable dvd Player and portable dvd players cost around 700 Dollars and the PSP around 300 dollars.2-The PSP ALso comes with a mp3 player around 200 dollarsDO DA MATH!!@!!!!@@!@!@3-psp also has accessiable internet browser thru ""Wipeout Pure""4-CaN play video(MP4) thru the hard ware of the psp NOT A DISK(movies and music videos)5-can play games using ur memory cardAND SOOO MUCH MORE"
1,Just not as good as I hoped,"Once the ""OOOohh, Ahhhh"" of the graphics wear off, and they do, all that you are left with is a system whose games are mostly PS2 remakes. Not what I would consider innovative. Save your hard earned $300 bucks for the PS3 coming out next year... or better yet, the Nintendo Revolution."
2,Not that GREAT!!,"I love my PlayStation 2, but this PSP sucks! The only thing I like was the graphics, but I don't care to much about that, if I did I would support the Xbox. Stick to the Nintendo DS. Atleast you get quality games at a reasonable price. $50 dollars a pop, come on, I'll rather spend that on the new God of War game. Basically its not worth it unless you don't have nothing else to spend you money on. What I have heard there are great games out there for the consoles. What a waste of $250+ dollars."
2,Save your money and get a DS,"Believe me I had one for like 4 days and I took it back. Dont get me wrong its cool for the first few days, your in hog heaven but then the ""novelty"" wears off and its not so special anymore. Dead Pixels, check. Dust, check. Ports, check. $50 games, check. You'll probably spend most of your time worrying about your dead pixels (which if you dont get you better consider yourself luck, even Sony says dead pixels are ""normal"") then actually playing games. I looked at the games coming out on the PSP and the DS and opted to get my money back and get the DS, $100 cheaper and guess what no dead pixels. The DS isnt on par graphics wise with the PSP but its still the better overall system IMO."
5,PSP=MP3 player/Movie Player/Game Player/Photo Developer/Internet Browser,"Psp is an exellent portable device ever built. Man, I cant it can play music, movies, games, pictures and logs on to the internet, which is totally AWWWWWWWWSOME!!!!! Well the internet update came out in Japan for the psp last week and is comming out in the U.S. next week Friday, people in America Already have and downloaded the internet update in their psp.Well enough about that I like to say to those BIG NINTENDO LOVER LOSERS to stop sending in bad, low rate, and extremly rediculous reviews about the PSP and Saying Nintendo DS is better. Everybody in America knows that DS is garbage. I mean come on, two gameboy advance sized screens? Give me a break. Nintendo's reign is over, their N64 Lost to Playstation, gamecube lost to X-Box and Ps2. Face it nintendo fans, Nintendo fans Nintendo is at Death Row. SEGA quit making consoles, why dont YOU? Sony will conquer any system including X-Box."
1,just not intresting anymore!,"I used to love my psp,but its nothing but boring now.The games graphics are cool but most of the games are boring.And just like the other person said why watch a movie on a 4 inchscreen when you can see it on a plasma tv.If you want a realhandheld system you should buy a nintendo ds with over 100games out their and more coming.I know you wont regret getting one because its not boring,it has tons of games,it has a touch screen it has awesomeonline games and its worth every penny you own for only [...]!"
3,Way too much $$$!!!,"The PSP is good I'll give it that, but I think that Sony is cramming too much stuff into thier first handheld. Make it more simple. plus it is WAAAAAAAY too much money, my parents are not gonna spend that much for me, and it's just not worth that much, nor should anyone have to spend that much on a system meant for gaming, with a few extra goodies thrown in. You over obsesive gamers...-_-"
1,awful,"I heard my friend bought this and he let me try it. Let me just say that this is the worst handheld ever. The graphics and sound are good but controls and overall playability sucks. Sony also made the mistake of putting a lot of remakes that people have on consle. Four hour life span??? That alone is enough to put off any smart customers. If anybodys reading this, save your money for somthing good."
2,SO WHAT!!!!!??????????,"So what if it can play songs? It only has six hours of battery life. Don't you have an Ipod, MP3 player, or CD player? Use that. It plays movies too. Use a DVD player -maybe a portable one- not this three inch screen (2 hours for movies). I will give it one thing, it has impressive graphics. But would you rather have a handheld that invests in the innovation of gaming, or giving it's own handheld a few features that most of us already have such as DVD players or music players. I am not saying that it is not a good machine, I am just saying that you shouldn't spend extra money for something most of us already have. I you like Sony, I suggest you wait for the next-generation of its handhelds. The games are good."
4,Impressions after one day.,"I got my government check in the mail and decided to use half of it to buy a PSP.Here are my fist impressions.-I was really surprised be the graphics. They are like a step down from the PS2-The machine seems very delicate. I will spend much time obsessing over it. Also, I couldnt imageine using it as a music deivce since it is too big and delicate (I'll stick with my IPOD)-I've heard a bunch of cool things you can do with it, so I look foward to exploring the possiblities."
4,great graphics but nothing new than a PS2 with a mini screen,its definately really cool to carry a PS2 in your pocket but its pointless buying a screen for my PS2 would be a lot cheaper.But i got one even with all the risks of dead pixels and some other glitches. First i saw the screen and graphics are really awesome but then my screen started getting these little dots and now i have like 10 little dots on my screen. Well i got Spiderman 2 and it ran pretty good but again the PS2 mini screen can any DVD. So yeah. And the music is pointless to me because i have an ipod which has much better sound.PSPS are definatly cool but just a bit to many glitches.
3,As usual,"As usual, Amazon can't resist bilking its customers. Instead of simply selling PSP as an individual item, it ""bundles"" it with a bunch of unwanted extra stuff in order to inflate the price well above what ""regular"" stores charge for it."
3,VERY FRAGILE!,"Alright so the PSP is cool. The games look nice and are fun to play. However, my PSP fell off my kitchen table. When I turned it on the screen had a black line going through it. Now I know what you're saying 'Duh you're not supposed to drop it' I know this. But if you're looking for something with a little more durability I'd go with a nintendo handheld. Both my original GB and my GBA have been through hell and work like the day I bought'em."
5,THE PSP ROCKS!!!!!!!,"THE PSP IS THE BEST PORTABLE GAMING SYSTEM EVER. WHEN I FIRST GOT A GBA SP ITHOUGHT THAT WAS COOL UNTIL I SAW THE PSP WITH EVERY GAME YOU COULD THINK OF. I KNEW I COULDN'T WAIT FOR CHRISTMAS SO I SOLD MY GBA SP AND A FEW OTHER THINGS AND GOT IT. SO IF YOU WANT A PORTABLE SYSTEM WITH GREAT GRAPHICS AND SOUND, THE PSP IS THE WAY TO GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Why didn't sony think of this sooner?,"The sony psp is a great idea, i don't no why they didn't think of it earlier. here are some of the key features, beautiful flat screen (don't get it dinged up), games (umd's) that can fit in your pocket, the system can fit in your pocket. i'll admit that it dosn't have many good games YET. but don't go trashing it because of the games. you could also watch movies on it and it has an mp3 player for a few nice bonus features. all in all a great system but you might wait till the price goes down or until it has better games"
5,A new generation in portable entertainment!!!,"This brings DVD quality video, and playstation two graphics/gaming to the palm of your hands. The price is slowly coming down on these, and now is as good of time as any to buy this system. The title selectin continues to grow (except for the movie selection, dwindling, but still coming), and the games are as child frindly to mature as you want. This also plays mp3's, and easy usb connection to other systems. With a big screen and nicely spaced controls, good playability, it is the leader in the handheld gaming market, one of the few. Worth buying if you travel, or are always on the move and must game on the go."
4,"A Great Game System, But ........","I think this is a excellent system and I agree with just about every good point other customers have made about it, however, the only complaint I have is that the screen scratches up so easily. Perhaps they should have made it a flip down screen or had a flip down screen protector on it because my son had a game boy advance sp with a flip down screen for over three years and there were absolutely no scratches on the screen whatsoever. The scratches are very noticably when not in use, but doesn't appear too bad when it's turned on. My son really hasn't got to use it for any other functions than games and movies, but we are both very pleased. It is a little overpriced too."
5,Ultimate Multi Gaming Device!!!!!,"The PSP is a nice game system released by Sony. It has many features that are awesome when on the go or even at home. Features includes: games(Universal Media Disks/UMD), MP3, movies(UMD), internent(wireless connection is needed, of course), and you can also download videos and photos onto your PSP. This value pack has pretty much what you need, except for games that is. It includes headphones w/remote, cleaning cloth, charger, battery pack, 32mb memory stick pro duo, and the PSP soft case. If you need game suggestions I would reccomend: Pursuit Force, Daxter, Ratchet and Clank:Size Matters, Full Auto 2, and also Burnout: Dominator. So as you can see, this IS the ultimate multi gaming device!!!!PSP:A+. Hope this review helps you if need games on the go."
4,Rocks!,"I got an early PSP from Japan and I really dig it though I don't like th proprietary UMD format and I hate the proprietary Memory Stick Pros which cost too freakin' much. Other than that, this thing rocks and is a great companion on the road!"
2,Meh...not great,"I really wanted to give this system a fair shot. I truely did; however, after trying to get into game after game, I just can't get addicted to any one. The psp been collecting dust. I'm not saying don't buy it, but I'm rather saying that you may want to see if the game selection is to your liking before putting down money for this(if you're going to buy it just for the multimedia features, give it more thought-in my opinion, they are overrated, unless you have a huge memory stick). Also, who's going to put down 20 bucks for a movie that doesn't have half as many features as normal DVD's? There's an adapter to connect the PSP to the TV, but that's another 70 dollars.EDIT: After a while, I bought a larger(1 gb) memory stick and some DVD converting software. I am beginning to see the video capabilities on this, and I wish I could bump the rating higher. Also, I bought some good games(Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2006 and Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror)."
1,I Think The PSP Sucks!,"I think this System Sucks Because here are 3 Things I have to say about this system!1. It's Too Expensive!2. It's like the PS2 (Like when you can play Movies, Music, and Games for both PS2 and PS1)3. It Breaks automatically in a few weeks.Go for the Nintendo DS Instead of this stupid piece of Crap System."
3,I'm not being biased,"I have a DS. I like it very much. I heard about the PSP. The PSP is a different system. The DS and PSP are too different to compete. I like my DS due to the Innovation. Those out side the box thinkers like the DS but those more of 'Tons a new Extra features' and 'oh, I hate kiddie games' type of people will like the PSP. It has a movie, music and photo player and great graphics too. The analog stick is okay, but only one analog stick makes remakes of games like ape escape lose their charme. Most of the people who would buy this is the skate punk wannabee or the violent moody kid. Some games have potential, but I think the PSP was just to get money for the PS3 (which I won't be buying)."
1,Was great but don't upgrade to 2.8!,"Was upgrading my psp from 2.6 to 2.8 and the thing just locked up. I left it on for about 10 minutes. Yes the psp was plugged in and my battery was at 100! I finally decided to turn the thing off. Had to hold down the power button. When I turned it on the screen didn't turn on. The green light is on for like 10 to 15 seconds and then it just shuts offf. Out trash, I say. Will never buy any sony garbage again. Never had to upgrade firmware with the nintento gameboy lineup. Sony firmware and tech support is horrendous, Avoid like church and the plague."
1,Why all this added junk??,The value pack contains a lot of things not needed. The 32mb memory stick for example is barely enough to store a few things and you now can get sticks over 1GB! The included movie is an old one (Spider Man 2) and its not even good. he rest of the stuff is just not needed and can be had for a cheaper price individually.
1,"PSP vs. DS, one of the most telling answers lies in...",the number of stars of the Average Customer Review between them! More of THE PEOPLE find themselves happy with the DS even though many people knew the PSP was coming! Isn't it usually when you first get something that you're most excited about it. DS' rating has stood the test of time and it's still higher than PSP. Plus this is after months of very little games for DS. DS is gonna to get excellent games in the future far better than what's being announced for PSP.
2,"Neat, But Over Hyped","Its a new device, its neat, but not quite as nice as I was expecting...I never played a PS2, but if this is what PS2 graphics look like, I will stick with my Xbox..Movies look great on this thing, but honestly the games I played don't look that great... Lots of pixelization...Maybe I am expecting too much, I don't know, the WOW factor just is not there..."
4,Very good item,"This is a very good hand-held. I can get almost everything to work, but the MP3. There's not that many good games out for this yet, but the is going to be really soon. I have two games for this and one video. I love my game wipeout pure, but hate my game untold legends. Spider-man 2 was good on this, but for some reason it wasn't as good as it is on a dvd player on tv. I've heard on IGN that the psp is going to be a wireless PS3 controler. For all the people who don't have this and are planing to get it, wait a year or two when the price goes down and there are good games out. I love this system, I'm looking forward to that game Daxter."
1,Just a heads up....,Just to let you know since the psp is plasima it will only last about 5 or maby even 6 years.My science teacher tould me that. So just a recomundation is that you get a ds or if you really need wirless internet music and movies than get laptop it will save you money. I have never played a sony system so I am not aginst it I just think that you should save your money and get something that would last longer that 6 yrs or less. I have had my laptop for like 7yrs and it is working like a charm!Thanks.
3,pros and cons,"PSP is more suitable for extreme gamers. It's sleek, mature look are more suitable for teenagers or adults. For kids, I recommend GBA SP or GBA DS. The selection of games are more in tune with popular titles like POKEMON. PSP is more for teens as it has more action and maybe violence in it. The selection of games are more like racing, sports...things that usually does not appeal to children.Next, I want to enphasise on the use of memory sticks in PSP. Everything must be stored in memory sticks so it is a bit inconvenient. What more, the memory sticks cost quite a sum so be prepared to spend lots of money on them.But, the graphics on PSP are way better than those found on GBA. It is capable of displaying about 15 million colurs wherelse GBA DS can only display 260,000 colours only.So as to conclude the end of this review, PSP's graphics and features are good. But think about the amount of money to spend on memory cards...think twice."
5,sell every unused electronic item/games to buy this,"What I'm currently doing is selling all of my Game Boys, my Playstation, Playstation one (mini/portable) with the LCD screen attatchment, my Nintendo 64 and every single game I own for these game consoles. I'm selling everything just to buy this. Basically, the new PSP is everything in one. The graphics and display for such a small, portable device is the most amazing thing I've ever seen. The games are really small discs...smaller than what you'd expect for a mini CD. When they said that they're mini...they're not kidding.What I meant by it's everything in one...I meant it as like every game console you own is basically all in that little thing. It seriously is the most amazing gameing device Sony has ever made."
3,THE IS MISSING A GREAT GAME,ITS MISSING THE BIBLE GAME THAT GAME IS AWESOME THE OTHER SYSTEMS HAVE IT WHY DOESENT THE PSP OTHER THAN THAT ILOVE THE PSP
2,"seems great, but ...","My PSP just arrived. When I turned it on, there was a white area in the center of the screen which might be part of the ""dead pixel"" problem everyone seems to be writing about, but I doubt it - the area is linear and angled, where pixels should be round and arranged in rows. This is a defective screen. When I called Sony, they said only about 1 in 10 screens are perfect! Don't spend your money on a defective product - wait until Sony does some quality control!ps - why are people rating a gaming/DVD system for ""educational value""???"
5,Great device for gaming and watching movies,"There are many complaints about how fragile it is but so are any portable device you buy. It is all about protection. As far as comparing it to the DS....I like them both just as much as the other. I know if it weren't for mario kart i wouldn't own the DS. Competition wise, it is good to have them both on the market to drive prices down or keep them lower."
5,What to buy?,"Let's just get this straght. If you want one of the best handheld systems ever with best graphics ever.Don't even read the rest of this, buy a psp. If you like to know more listen up!The psp is a very good system. Although buy screen protectors deffinatley your psp screen is fatal to not getting scrated. The system is able to store photos music etc. The system is just like a playststion 2 and a screen togheter. The nintendo ds however does have two screens.One being touchable and the other not. The system graphichs are horrible! Maybye slighty better than a gameboy. If you ask me psp is worth the $250. The nintendo ds is not reccomended by me. The people who like it must not like good graphics. If you ask me by a psp.p.s. Nintendo ds screen gets scratched because you use a stylus."
3,PSP DS WHATS THE FUS,OK EVERYONE IS FIGHTING WHICH ONE IS BETTER PSP DS WHILE LET ME BREAK IT TO YOU THAT THEY BOTH HAVE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES SO GET OVER IT ITS JUST A SYSTEM IF YOU HATE IT SO MUCH RETURN IT THATS IF YOU CAN LOL!!!! YA DEAD PIXELS AND BREAKS EASY BALH BALH BALH IF YOU THINK DS IS BETTER THEN GET A DS AND IF YOU THINK PSP IS BETTER GET A PSP AND STOP ALL THE FIGHTING ABOUT WHICH SYSTEM IS BETTER AND BY THE WAY THEY BOTH ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,BLEAH!!!,Im sorry Sony but the PSP is not that great.Other than Wipeout and Lumines the games blow!High detailed graphics and features dont make up for this.If anyone reading this wants a true handheld buy a ds or sp.
3,bad for your eyes,i bot the psp a week ago and it sucked it was really expensive$250 and the games were they were kind of fun butit wasb stupid why would somebody spent money on something that could playsome dvds while a regular dvd player can play all the dvds its a waist of your eyes and money. not only that but it made me squint at the screen it is so small my advise is dont buy any thing portabile but like the gameboy advance you can make it on the big screen. i hope you like my review.
2,Not so great anymore,Hey the PSP might have a MP3 and MOvie player but the nintendo DS no has a MP3/movie player on another website and a tv so you attach a adapter and you have a portable tv on lik-sang.com burn psp burn hahahaha
1,"What is the obsession with the ""all-in-one""?","I remember a day when we bought electronics that did one thing exceptionally well.No more. Most products now have to have other worthless gimicks or ""features"" to entice people to buy them. PSP can play movies and music and photos, go on the internet (with the appropriate hack) and other amazing things other than just playing games. Well I listen to music on my ipod, can surf the web and look at pictures on my laptop and watch movies at home off my dvd player on my 25"" screen TV instead of a tiny ass 4.3 inch LCD, hell even my laptop can play dvds if I absolutely need it. And I don't have to drop $400 for a bundle.What is the deal with needing to be constantly entertained every minute of everyday?"
3,Fine graphics! (other things you could buy with that money),"I saw my friend's PSP, and in it was a game with blobs that changes coulors or something. Anyway, Thae graphics were clear, and the screen was flat. I heard that it can play DVDs too! That's interesting. Thay sound expencive though. (You could get 2 gamecubes, a gameboy game, and a few puzzles with that money. You could also get about 3 gameboy SPs, or you could get a nintendo DS aand about two gameboy games, or a comuter game!) Using all of that money on one thing...think about it first, or if you REALLY want it, ask for it, babysit, or just save money! This toy has a little thing that you can move around like a joystick, and I think 4 buttons like the DS. Think abOUT IT FIRST!!!"
2,Dead Pixels Also,"The graphics for the pSp are really good compared to ds; however, I am also concerned with the dead pixel issue. I just purchased one and it had 3 dead pixels.. I called Sony and (was on hold forever) and the tech support was telling me (??)that it was standard for all of the LCDs to have these dead pixels???I personally question this norm.."
1,Too much for too little,The psp would have been great expect for the 250.00 price tag for that price you can buy a PS2 with two brand new games. The movie features on this are limited considering you can play the UMD movies only on the PSP.I would wait for the price to drop and a better selection of games come out. And do not buy from people selling their psp for over this price because most retailers have enough in stock that paying a ridulous amount is not warranted. My retail store still has most of our stock for this item and so do other retail stores in my area so I would wait or look around and not spend 400 dollars on something when you can enjoy current systems for much less.If you live in the bigger cities I would recomend rural stores or smaller stores they are more likely to have the stock if bigger stores do not.
3,"Good System, with flaws, i hate amazon","This is a good system, graphics are nice, i like the mp3, mpeg player although never tried it. i dont feel like buying the cables for it. The fingerprint effect is terrible, you dont even have to tought the PSP just bring your finger close to the PSP and there is a smudg.MY LAST POINT IS THAT I HATE AMAZON, I WAS SELLING 2 PSP'S ON AMAZON BUT AMAZON CANCELED IT WHEN SOMEONE BOUGHT THE UNIT,I HAVE NO IDEA WHY.GOOD SYSTEM"
1,"Good, but....","This system rocks, but there are major flaws. The screen is beutiful but within 5 seconds it is scratched and smudged.Ridge Racers is the ONLY good game for it unless you love violence and puzzle games.The price is WAY to high.Sony,if you want to suceed then make your systems so that we can actually BUY them! Overall, its a good system but it needs some work."
2,"Very fun & addicting, but just has and outrageous price...","The PSP is a very awesome, fun, shiny, and has many features and good games, BUT it's so freakin' expensive! I wanted to get one, but I thought about it and I'll just buy a PS3 when it's out.The PSP also is very fragile, has dead pixels,is too expensive, the games are too expensive,it's slippey, and really tiny.I would reccomend you to wait for the price to reduce before you buy. Come on Sony, I hope you do better on your next handheld system."
1,Awful,This product is awful... it broke as I took it out of the box and I got a new one that broke after putting the game cd in! I found out later that SONY make thier products to break so you buy another! I then bought a DS that has never failed! It has a wide variety of games and is the best console Ive everbought!!
3,Average...,"A decent try from Sony to rule the handheld empire of the big N. But too many cons. Small battery life, disapointing games, nothing revolutionary. BUT it is the Ipod for movies. PLUS MP3 player. Buy for it's multimedia capabillities not for games"
5,Cool like whoa!,"The PSP is the best thing that ever happened to me. I got the DS for my birthday last year and was pleased. But when i got the PSP it lit up my life, like no other. like the title says it is cool like whoa. the games are excellent, the movies are great, and the control is amazing. buy the PSP, you will be pleased, for sure."
5,"Great System, But Having a Few Problems","PSP is great, no doubt about it. The graphics and gameplay are both awesome. But right now im having a problem with it. The other day I was playing it in the car and it froze on me. I was able to reboot the system, but since then the games I have have not worked, and I get a message when I try to play games saying ""The Disk Could Not Be Read."" I tried a couple of things, but nothing has seemed to work. Am I going to have to get a new one?? Please anyone out there, if you have any advice for me or if this has happened to you, please let me know what I should do....."
2,Okay.,This is okay but I didn't want all this added features such as listening to music or playing movies since I bought this to play games.
5,THE BEST HANDHELD SYSTEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,I love it it is so cool and I love the umd format it is the best buy one you will love it yet not that durable overall 5 stars hands down I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!.
3,PSP is great but the bundle I bought there was no game inclu,They couldv'e included a game but no! The price was to much! I bought it anyway and spent $330.13 ouch!..I have only 2 games so far and I have yet to buy the ridiclously high priced memory cards!... Thanx alot Greedy SCEA!...Its definitely the Future of HandHelds!..But a bit to pricey!...But we shall see E3-2005 coming up Nintendo's has some new PSP like device to be shown at E3--..Watchout SCEA..LOL...
1,Possibly the Shoddiest Portable ever made........,"well i bought the psp because the graphics are nice. but i became frustrated with the lack of games and the short battery life so i traded it in for store credit and got a ds. i thought it would be cool to watch umd movies and play music, but i didn't end up using it that much as i have a portable dvd player and the umd titles aren't that numerous. the clincher was when i found out that nintendo was releasing the play-yan in late 2005, which allows ds users to watch mpeg movies and play mp3s. plus the games are so much better on the ds with many more great ones to come. the ds's graphics aren't as good (and i'm not too fond of the touch screen), but with games like jump superstars, castlevania, nintendogs, new super mario brothers, etc. and the ability to play gba games (legend of zelda: the minish cap, mario and luigi superstar saga, etc.) the ds is a much much better handheld, in my opinion. and it's battery lasts 10x as long."
1,yuck,"yes, i know, this is a gaming console first, then a movie theater on the go second, then MP3 player third. when i got it, tho, i almost immediately returned it. i didn't like it at all. the sound quality for the movies was horrrible, as was the sound quality of the music and games. i do not suggest buying this, but if you've already read good reviews from satisfied customers and you're convinced, don't say i didn't warn you. thanks for reading."
2,Displeased.,"Before I begin, the minute anybody calls me a Sony hater, or a Nintendo Lover, or whatever bad name you will call me, I will instantly report you. I absolutely adore Sony, but I have to side with Nintendo on this one...PROS--Sleek Design--Plays moviesCONS--Boring,short range of games--Slow,uncooperative internet access--Easily scratched screenNow, I will do The DS (**I HAVE BOTH**)PROS--Fun,exciting range of games (well more than PSP)--Sleek,innovative design (I bet you are going to comment on this..)--Multiplayer INTERNET games (Wi-Fi..Lan..)--Some other stuff I cant think of right nowCONS--Doesn't play movies--I'll tell you when I think of more ;)*I had a PSP*, Then after about 2 1/2 weeks, I got fed up and returned it, using the money to instead by a *DS*. Best move. Sorry for you haters out there!! :'( I was dissapointed, so I posted my OPINION!Love to ya'll!Sarah"
1,Sorry,"I just can't recommend this system to anybody. First of all, the games are horrible! They are just PS2 games that were remade to be portable. The PSP's lineup of exclusive games is pathetic. Lumines is the only one so far and it is a boring, uneventful game to say the least. Sony needs to realize that it isn't the graphics that make the game, it is the game that makes the game. Not a good system at all, skip this and wait for the PS3 or Revolution to come out."
5,smaller but greater,This psp is greater than any portible out there. You can have music movies photoes internet and great games all in this littel muchine. You can not go rong if you get this.
3,"Fair, not wonderful",This was a Christmas present for my son. The screen has two small pin size white spots in the screen. It's a little annoying when watching movies.
1,This is the WORST gaming system on the face of the planet.,"This system is pointless. All the system is is bad movies, ports of bad games, and lousy music space. I see NO POINT in buying one of these things. The DS runs circles around it. Sow aht if it was Grand Theft Auto? Whoopty-doo, give me Mario Kart with WiFi Play ANYDAY. The PSP is as fragle as a wine glass. One drop and it's GONE. Think you can just get a new one through warrenty? Prepare for a 3-month affair with incredibly long waiting periods just to get another PSP that probobly has more defects then the first one. Unlike the Nintendo DS that is cheaper, more durable, and if you manage to break it, Nintendo's Warrenty has you covered. And don't pull that ""The DS has GBA graphics"" crud. So what if the DS has worse graphics than the PSP? Graphics don't mean much in a game. It's all gameplay. And by the way, I'd like to see a GBA pull of the graphics of Nintendogs or Mario Kart DS."
5,Great System but Amazon won the Moron Store of the year!!!,"This is the best system, everything beats the DS, and the PSP will for sure have a better 2nd generation of games than the DS. If you look on a multi platform game that is on the DS and the PSP the PSP version of the game is always alot better, but i'm not going to get into that just don't buy it from this store. It should cost only $250, and also the one with the 4 games does not show any highly rated game, but that does not matter because if you READ CAREFULLY it says that you don't even get the games they show, it's random.DO NOT GET THE GAME FROM THIS STORE TOO MUCH MONEY!!!!!! IT SHOULD BE OVER $100s LESS I OWN ONE AND I GOT IT FOR $250 + THE GAMES AND STUFF I GOT"
2,$250 is too much,"Pretty much overpriced, but it is an OK system if you can afford it. For half the price, you can get a Nintendo DS, which has a higher customer satisfaction rating here at amazon. Or for 1/4 of the price, you can get a gameboy advance SP or a micro. No i'm not a nintendo fanboy but they currently offer a better value to gaming. Sony is more like $$$ony these days."
5,The PSP ROX,"I purchased an Import PSP in about the middle of January and I can't stop playing it. I have Japanese Ridge Racers and THUG 2 Remix, best game ever. I highly recommend getting the PSP if you want something better than portable mario games. [...]"
4,Great portable system,"The resolution is great, the game play is better then I expected and it is easy to use. I connected it right to my wireless network with WEP encryption. So far I am very happy with the PSP."
5,Finally a portable I can play.,"I always had problems with other portables. Too small of screen or didn't fit my hands. The PSP is great! Wasn't planning on buying one at first, but happy I did."
1,Buyer Beware,"Ok I purchased this exact item, as you can see its a 22 inch, 5 mm figaro gold necklace.... what i recieved was a 22 inch 4 mm necklace! And I also thought it was odd that they would send a sucker as well with a $400 purchase.... kind of funny.... send a sucker to the sucker.... If you do decide to work with this company, do not trust what they are giving you is actually what you are recieving... check it out"
5,Sibling Stories,"There seem to be few books that focus solely on the siblings of learning disabled children. I think this book would be very reaffirming for families with autistic children and could encourage discussion on difficult family issues. I also think that this book would be helpful to parents of children without learning disabilities. As a parent with 2 non-learning disabled children, I read this book to better understand sibling relationships in general. Many of those interviewed shared so much of their pain and joy. I found it very compelling and insightful. I could not put it down and read it in one evening. I really felt like I had met these people."
5,Excellent Resource Guide,"Sibling Stories is an excellent compilation of information. It provides families and friends with invaluable resources including organizations and associations as well as a broad range of emotional perspectives that so many readers can relate to. The interviews are poignant and honest. As a sibling of a sister with a disability, I recognized myself in so many of the siblings interviewed in this book. Although Sibling Stories is about ASD, it is appropriate for any family member that has a sibling or child with a disability. This book is rich in content and emotion - a book to always keep readily available on your bookshelf!"
1,Rather useless.....,"It doesn't work for what we intended it for: blackhead removal. My teen son was really hoping this would help him.... and it didn't. Not only that, but the safety cap for the lance end doesn't stay on."
3,"Watch great, band tight","Watch looks good and nice bright light. It was a gift for my husband who likes a stretchy watch band. This band was snug and extremely difficult to change to a longer band, relative to most watches. My husband gave up, and I finally did it but not without multiple tries and a considerable effort."
1,TIMEX JUNK,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS WATCH IT IS JUNK GOLD TONE CAME OFF QUICKLY CONTACTED TIMEX NO HELP THREW IT AWAY
1,This may just be the worst book I ever read!,"I have never read a book more full of itself or more overflowing with clumsy metaphors and odd plot contrievances. The characters are cookie cutter boring little people. For example, let's look at the dead daughter. She is described basically as perfect, only using more flowery corny junk to do so.And then there's the beautiful passage where he finds his daughter's shoe (which has somehow not been found at the crash) and picks it up, reminiscing. But Oh! it's too much and he throws it down. Nearly every chapter ends with a rediculous metaphorical summary of what has just happened. These closing paragraphs make up some of the worst writing I've ever read. Hilarious though.I could go on and on. I like almost any book I read, classic or not (except for really poor books). But this I could not stand. The melodrama and the general poorness of it hurts. Maybe you'll have to read this someday for school like me."
3,Dissapointed,"A Little Taste of India (A Little Taste Of...)This book was a dissapointment because I expected to find many more recipes. Buy a used book, not worth paying full-price."
2,Not as good as their old mimeographs,"This book is disappointing. While it may help a college student or other really new person grasp some of the concepts of organizing it is not useful to practioners.The Midwest Academy used to have a very good training manual covering many issues. As the book got slicker looking the information got worse.Get Shel Trapp's old Basics of Organizing instead - much more useful, and free on the internet."
2,spice 1 has fell off,spice needs to quit rappin cause he's only put out 2 good records in 9 years spiceberg slim and the black bossalini.mc eiht puts it down but spice has lost it go back to 187 he wrote.geah
4,OK,It does its job. Although i have owned one of these in the past and this one seems to be a little touchy. All the readings seem to be high. A .15 after 2 beers seems a little unrealistic... but oh well.
1,Don't Purchase this unit,"Purchased the unit in October. In January, it quit working. The description of the error message in the user's guide says that ""the unit has been damaged and will need to be returned for servicing."" The company support dept. responded that the unit needs calibration which costs 1/3 the cost of the unit itself and that calibration is required every 1-12 months. If the unit is defective and the warranty is one year, why would you pay 1/3 the price to have the unit repaired? Since it is disposable, buy the $30 unit and throw it away when it stops working. this one is a ripoff."
1,DO NOT BUY,"What a waste of money! Compared the results with a professional (police-issued) breathalyzer, and it was not even close! The mfg. says it may need to be calibrated from time to time, but calibrated when it's right out of the box - ridiculous. The difference between the Alcohawk and the professional breathalyzer was a FULL POINT. Not off by .02 or .03; a full point."
4,Good product,"This was my second purchase of an Alcohawk. An acquaintance borrowed my first one and never returned (so I guess she thought it was a good purchase too). It never gave me a bit of trouble. The second one I purchased however, gave a .32 reading after drinking a glass of wine, so it needed to be recalibrated. The company does recalibrate for a small fee. My main advice is don't lend this out :)"
2,Good for a little while...,"Greatest 21st bday present ever.Except when it gets over-used. The company has a service by which they recalibrate it (for $20) if it has been used too much and isn't reporting the right levels. I have only used it moderately (occasionally with friends and always per the instructions), but the levels it reports now are through the roof and very inaccurate. I have sent it in twice to get serviced, and within a couple uses afterwards, it was bad again.Other issues I have with it: the button gets pressed very easily, even through the case, which causes it to beep."
2,"Good for a few months, then get ready to pay $ to recalibrate","At first I was happy with the device, as I felt the readings were accurate and consistent. After about 8 months, the readings became very inconsistent, probably an indicator that the breathalyzer already needed calibration. For example, a person blows into the device and gets a 0.2 reading. 5 minutes goes by, the same person blows into the device again, but this time gets a higher 0.8 reading. Since I purchased this device, the high price of calibration has jumped even higher from $20 to $25. Let me just say how unhappy I am with having to calibrate the Alcohawk Pro roughly every 6 months or so for the extremely high price (especially relative to the cost of the device itself) of $25. Rather than spending the money to calibrate the device, I'll probably just sell it and be done with it."
1,Total Waste of Money,Bought to check people prior to driving after a party. What a joke. Totally inaccurate. Has always been used per instructions and it gets wildly inaccurate results. People who have drank nothing show up as drunk and those staggering around show up under limits. DO NOT TRUST THIS UNIT!
1,Bad product at a bad price,"I would tell anyone looking at breathalyzers to pass on this product - it is too expensive for a deeply flawed device. I was looking for a serious tool to keep friends and family from driving after drinking too much, but this isn't it; the AlcoHawk Pro requires a minimum waiting period of 20 minutes after eating or drinking to take a measurement. Even then, we get error messages about half the time.Save your money and take a pass on this one."
3,Cant test for accuracy,"How can you test this thing? They want you to send it in to get calibrated, but I never did."
4,Great product - easy to use,This product works well and is very easy to use. It is well worth the money in my opinion and can save you thousands of dollars! It's amazing how few drinks you can actually have and legally drive!
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!,Why would anyone want to buy one of these?? JUST drink responsibly and you will be fine this is going to empty your pockets FAST!!!
4,Makes Parties Interesting!,"We have a lot of parties so I purchased the breathalyzer to make sure people are safe to drive home. It is also fun to use just to measure alcohol content consumed. The item seems to work great however, be sure to wait the 20 minutes after drinking and eating before blowing into it. If you don't wait, it can cause the device not to work properly and you will have to send it in for recalibration. It only costs about $20 to recalibrate but it can become an inconvienence."
4,Decent Breathalyzer,I don't drink to often so when I do it's hard to know my limits. This thing really helps. However I found that you really have to wait a while after your last drink before it can get a good reading. Once I blew a .04 then 5 minutes later I blew a .09!! I trust this thing works though. It does warn you that you should wait about 20 minutes after your last drink. I would wait longer though. It was worth the money for me. You should send it to be calibrated every 6 months though.
5,A Great Gift for Those You Care About,"I bought this item as a kind of ""gag-gift"" for the training department of my largest client. They are a pretty young group and like to party every now and then. They thought that it was hilarious that I got it for them and immediately started joking about how they could incorporate it into some of their drinking games (on their days off of course). Later I learned that what started as a joke led to them using it to make sure that their team members were fit to drive. I received some sincere thanks from them later for caring enough to get them this well made, pro-quality detector."
5,Follow THE directions and it works like it should!,"So man bad reviews on this product and related products. It clearly states to wait 20 minutes after your last drink to get an accurate reading. I tested this, I took a shot of tequila ""first drink"" and went straight to the AlcoHawk Pro,, read a .10, which is legally drunk in TX. 15 minutes later, it read .002 and 5 minutes later .001. Then for the beer test. I chugged a 24oz Bud Light and straight the Alcohawk pro, it read a .216, which is pretty darn high!! 20 minutes later .002 .. So when I go out drinking, I stop drinking 20 minutes before I leave said given location to make sure I know what I am at. It is worth the extra money compared to the crap ones for $[...].. It comes in a hard carrying case and a lighter adapter for your car.. cheap ones do not have that!!I recomend everyone own one of these things!!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"We have purchase 2 Alcohawk breath testers. Both lasted barely a year... just enough to go beyond the warranty period. They each came up with ""SN"" meaning the tester can't recalibrate. The solution? Send it into Alcohawk for recalibration (with a fee) and everything's fine, right? Wrong! They claim the unit cannot be calibrated and offer us a lousy $15 trade-in toward a new tester. So our $100+ testers are now worth only $15 trade-in!Our advice: Don't EVER buy anything ""Alcohawk""! Look someplace else and consider a company that stands behind their product!"
4,A GOOD MLB GAME,THIS IS A GOOD MLB GAME TO BUY IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BASEBALL GAME FOR YOUR PSP. IT IS MUCH BETTER THEN EA SPORTS MVP GAME THE ONLY THING THAT IS KINDA HARD IS PLAYING THE OUTFIELD. BUT OVER ALL ITS A GOOD GAME TO HAVE.
5,Baseball. Down to the Smallest Details,"This game rocks man. The graphics are unbeleivable. The gameplay is very realsistic. Certain players have their unusual batting stances and pitching windups, such as Johnny Damon and Orlando Hernandez. Also, the announcer is very good, he uses original phrases and does not have much repetition. The only minor gripe is that player ratings are weird. Dontrelle Willis is rated as the Marlins 4th best pitcher. Hes about the 4th best pitcher in the league. Also many players are overrated, when is Michael Young better than Alfonso Soriano and Mark Teixeira? Many good players are also underrated (i.e. Miguel Tejada, Bartolo Colon, Mark Buehrle, etc.) Also, every once in a while, a glitch occurs that has the pitcher just stand there, he will not throw the pitch and you cannot exit the game once this happens, but this happens very rarely, dont let it scare you from buying this game it really is a good game. I cant wait till 2006 comes out."
3,Baseball,The game took a little use to getting to but my son learned how to play it and now he loves it.
4,Garfields Excellent Excuses,I bought this book for my younger sister who is a major Garfield fan. She enjoyed the humorous excuses as well as trying them out on the rest of the family.
2,good for project ideas but wouldn't recommend,"This book is good for general park-related GIS project ideas but it lacks any real/useful content. Just reading the titles at the top of each page gives you the gist of the whole book. The images are basically useless. There are random images thrown in just to take up space and any GIS-related images are too small for interpretation. Basically, all of the images are useless. If you have to get this book, buy a cheap used copy (mine was like $5)."
3,There's more than money moving here.,"Tin Machine was a hard rock band fronted by David Bowie, with Reeves Gabrels and Hunt & Tony Sales. Bowie and the band wrote all songs, other than a cover version of John Lennon's ""Working Class Hero"". It's a decent album, although Bowie's voice is buried in the mix. I hate to sound like an old fogey, but I like Bowie's early stuff better."
3,million dollar habits book,"The quality of the book was ok, i thought it was quite aged inside, was expecting it to be a bit more modern."
4,A great romp,"I had forgotten how much fun!! these books are until they popped up on my recommendation list. The Vicky Bliss series by this author was one of the earlier examples of the genre we call romantic suspense. The author has a light comic touch and a wicked sense of humor. She writes great if not exactly heroic heroes. The setting was great and the cast of characters amusing but often sinister.The ending was harrowing, a bit unbelievable, but certainly gave me goosebumps. It leaves the door wide open for a sequel. The significance of the title is a bit subtle for some, but without giving too much away, it pretty much means that you are marked for death. This is a fast read, great for the beach or fun holiday reading."
4,light but good,"Silhouette in Scarlet is lighter in tone than many of Peters's novels. But it has her characteristic sense of humor and adventure. Vicky will meet a handsome stranger, a fabulous treasure, and bumbling crooks. And maybe even a distant relative. Enjoy!"
3,Normally I love E. Peter's books,"But this on fell a little flat. Still worth reading, but not as good as the first and second. Now working on the Third:)I'll let you know what I think...Angela"
2,table top soccer by Franklin........,"poorly made, very noisy, players knock each other's players right off the soccer board. The legs on the table are also not very stable. I am disappointed in the product and so was my daughter. Franklin is a highly reputable company. I guess I think differently now. but, for 20 dollars, what should have i expected."
3,Good ole trucker movie!,"I remember when White Line Fever was being filmed on location in Tucson Arizona back 1974. It is a decent movie about a young truck driver trying to make it in the corrupt trucking industry. If you are interested in and like trucks, you will enjoy this movie from the early 70's. The fifty dollar price tag for the video is high. I taped the movie several years ago one night off HBO."
2,"Good movie, subpar transfer","WHITE LINE FEVER is indeed a good movie. But the Sony Screen Classics by Request DVD-R is, disappointingly, non-anamorphic, which prevents me from recommending it. Sony's DVD-Rs are typically top-notch so this one exception is particularly frustrating. If anyone at Sony is reading this, please consider correcting the disc, and please let us fans know when you've done so, thanks."
4,$ 50.00,"The movie was good, but fifty dollars, is it line with gold, I would like to own the movie but with fifty dollars I can buy at least 4 to 7 movies, maybe it's an error, I would really like to know"
3,Flash back,"I was looking for a specific Jean Michael Vincent movie and this was not it, but it was a flash back from the past and it's not always bad watching the young Vincent."
2,A rather ordinary movie.,"There's nothing egregiously bad about ""White Line Fever"", it's a decent trucker movie about standing up against corruption and includes a few good stunts and fights, but the end result is just a very ordinary movie."
2,This Movie Gave Me White Line Fever,"This flick is a real snooze. There is a great film to be made about the plight of truckers but this isn't it. Jonathan Kaplan's inert and unimaginative direction scuttles the film. This is odd because a few years later Kaplan made an impact with his account of teens gone wild, ""Over the Edge"". Matters aren't helped by star Jan-Michael Vincent. He's the human equivalent of ennui. He makes Chuck Norris seem expressive. If you want to see better trucker films see Sam Peckinpah's ""Convoy"" or Norman Jewison's ""F*I*S*T"" with Sylvester Stallone."
5,White Line Fever,Very good qualitymovie. Didi not think I would find it anywhere. Thank you. Very speeding delivery also.
1,I just wasted my money for buying this book.,"This book 1. lacks samples; 2. lacks detailed explainations to the existing examples in this book; 3. has no answer keys to help students to try the exercises themselves. More reading of this book, more confussing."
5,Fantastic Product,"I love this stuff. I got my first sample through their web site. It keeps my naturally curly (and frizzy) hair manageable and shiny. It also makes it a dream to comb out in the mornings, where as the other products I have tried may work but are oily.I have naturally curly, wavy light brown hair that I sometimes have hilighted with red, which also helps to dry the hair out (gotta cover the grey some how). I have used this product for 2 weeks now and I have already seen a difference.My husband has also commented on how soft it makes my hair.I recommend this product!"
2,Flop,"I give this product a 2/5 because it doesn't fully work for my hair. While it does make my hair pretty soft, whether I apply to damp or dry hair, it does absolutely nothing for my frizzies.It smoothes them down for about 1 hour on dry hair, but quickly they spring right back.For reference: I have wavy/slightly curly hair. This product doesn't seem to work on either the color treated portions or the natural portions of my hair.In the past I would distribute a dime-sized amount of pure vitamin e oil on my shower damp hair and then just sleep on it for nice defined waves in the morning. I'll go back to that for now."
3,Good product,"This product worked nicely for my naturally curly hair. It gives a soft, not crunchy, look. Check prices in your area - I found it cheaper at Wal-Mart of CVS."
5,An illustrator,"Impressive illustrations that anyone will appreciate. A verynice story to go along with it. The person who has ""an issue with the story's underlying message"" in the book is oviously reading too far into it and should try to learn to enjoy it for what it is-an entertaining well written and beautifullyillustrated children's book. I highly recommend it."
4,One of my favorites,"I like this book because it has beautiful illustrations, that show animals and places in the jungle and Antarctica. I like the story, because Marco and Polo do interesting things and they stay friends."
3,Find the guardian angel who governs your birthdate.,This delightful book links specific angels to specific birthdates. It also gives information on families of guardian angels and a family tree showing how all are related.
2,VERY disappointed with item,This book is a total disappointment!! It is more like a book outline than a full book!! Sure glad I only paid for a used book and even at that I feel ripped off!! Do NOT spend the money paying for a new one!! My 8 year old grand-daughter read it in less than ten minutes and then tossed it aside. Very little info.Save your money!!
3,Good content hopelessly obscured by bad organization,"It pains me to give this book an average rating. It could score subtantially higher if it were not for the useless table of contents. I do not have time to read an 800 page book cover-to-cover. I rely on a well organized table of contents to help me focus on chapters of particular interest. Sections like ""Fretting Friendly Futures"", ""Profess Perspicacious Preparedness"", and virtually every other chapter and section make it impossible to see what this book has to offer. The intrepid investigator will find useful information, but it is not easy. I would love to see an addendum that simply provides the ""real"" table of contents."
3,Sorry about my disgraceful behavior..,"I found my mistake about my opnion. And I have so many dept to James Callan. Please accept my applogies.

3,A Bible for the Pumped Up Lifestyle - at Any age,"Clarence Bass is a walking advertisement for fitness and weight training. The dude is now in his 70's and looks incredibly ripped from a lifelong passion for weight-lifting. From that standpoint, ""Challenge Yourself"" is inspirational to anyone who is graying.""Challenge Yourself"" can be a challenging read, though, at least it was for me. The amount of detail and scientific data used by Bass to advance his approach to training can make your eyes glaze over and be tedious. His diet is daunting and meticulous. Many readers and fitness enthusiasts may want more HOW, less WHY. For this reason, I at times had to CHALLENGE MYSELF to finish this book.Bass' own body is a self-made work of art. Even if many of us look more like the Pillsbury Dough Boy than a graying Adonis, ""Challenge Yourself"" is a persuasive inspiration and reminder that - when it comes to getting lean and muscled - it's never too late!"
5,Fantastic Book!!!,"This is his best book to date.I have been working out for manyyears and I found his periodization work-out for advanced liftersto be one of the most practical work-outs I have ever tried.This book is a must read for any serious weight trainer.I also highly recommend reading Stuart McRobert's book ""BeyondBrawn"" and subscribing to the magazine ""Hardgainer"".Both these authors share many of the same views on training.Great Book!!!"
3,The same ideas...again!,"""Ripped"" and ""Ripped 2"", are brilliant books. He has been writing them over again. Like the ""Lean Advantage"", CLarence passes along the same information--in this book. As usual the books are all about BAss, which is okay, but gets a little out of hand. He even quotes himself (""as I said in Ripped 2.."") and often quotes his earlier books. He suffers from extreme ""over"" self quote-ism.Should you really quote yourself? All the time?And many of the stories (like of his boyhood goals etc..) are repeated in each book.Clarence as contributed some brilliant stuff on bodybuilding and training. Buy ""Ripped"" and ""Ripped 2"" and learn the lessons in those books. Every serious bodybuilder should read these books. HIs chapter on peaking (in Ripped 2) is as clear an understanding as you can get of it in a book.--And it works."
3,Great loader!,"I really like the FASTA. It feeds like a dream at a perfect 30bps, is relatively light, and is extremely durable.My only gripes with it are the facts that for one, it is pretty big and bulky, and two, the neck does not fit very well into ANY feedneck (Trinity, Warrior, NDZ) that I have tried. You either have to practically jam it in with a hammer or file down the beveled edges.But all in all it's worth the price for the performance that it offers and the amazing feed rate. DEFINITELY get the 18v over the 9v, for 10 bucks more for 10 more bps? Hell yeah."
3,A coffee table book,"A pretty book that is mainly a life-style and remodeling book. NOT a necessary book for anyone interested in sustainable building or substantial practical advice. I highly recommend The Natural House: A Complete Guide to Healthy, Energy-Efficient, Environmental Homes by Daniel D. Chiras. No glossy dream rooms (or houses) unless your dreams are realistic and desirous of making a smaller impact on the Earth."
4,A great overview of wholistic living homes,"The book is dated (1998), but the concepts and ideas are perhaps even more timely then when it was written. The book gives an overview of how various decisions in home building and daily living affect humans health--physical, mental, and spiritually, and how those choices affect the earth itself. This is a major undertaking for 300 pages, but the author actually does a good job of touching on most of the choices--choices that are as important to day as 15 years ago, and 15 years from now."
3,"""Natural House"" wasn't coined by this book","The comment that this book originated the term ""natural house"" ignores the Frank Lloyd Wright book, The Natural House, published in 1954. There are different focuses (more on ecology), but harmony with the environment isn't new.I haven't read the book, though I might. Why won't Amazon let me comment on a book without rating it?"
5,Must have for any Disney collector,"""Disney's Aladdin: The Making of an Animated Film"" consists of 7 chapters each features a main character from the film and each chapter handles a part of the production of the film. Through out the book you find sketches, frames, photos of the crew, storyboards etc, etc. Until and after the dvd is out in 2004 this book is the best source for detailed information on the production of this Disney masterpiece."
1,Very poorly structured book,"I enjoyed the film very much, and the images in the book are beautifully reproduced. It's a shame there seems to be no coherant structure to the book. The writing is extremely poor, and not once do the images and text refer to each other in any semblence of organization."
3,Note:This is a current review.,"I have always liked the Ernies for their uniqueness, but for some reason, I got tired of listening to it. Its all cool, and has funny lyrics, awesome chorus, and great saxophone solos, but still, it IS all the same as another reviewer mentioned. Still, you should try it out if you are into Ska, Punk, Rock, or whatever. (For a quick laugh and a very temporary favorite band.) It is a very cool, and funny album, but it gets old really quick, and the lead might drive you up the wall with his... unique singing talet... but it REALLY gets old. Ocassionlly I still listen to it, but it doesn't have as much of a charm as before."
2,ITS REDUNDANT,"Well at first I was really excited about the new CD...but then I heard the demo. The ernies sound changed from original ska influenced music to a very Jimmy's Chicken Shack sounding power chord rock. There are three good songs on this album: Here and Now (the not very ernies sounding single), Mr. Benson and the Meson Ray (a pretty good ska jam that they played at a lot of their shows), and Its Digestible (an incredible song which proves that the ernies could have put out a stronger major label debut, and also sounds incredible live). The ernies dont like to be labeled or catagorized and contained, but they have done just this, with a record that sounds like a mix between Rage, Jimmys Chicken Shack, and 311. If you are an ernies fan, I dont reccomend this to you, but if you like the aforementioned groups--knock yourself out. I am just glad I went to the Bouncing souls show instead of their record release show."
4,nice.....,"The watch is very nice. Well worth the price. What a deal.It is however, very large and heavy. Not for a small man. It would engulf his wrist. Just make sure and note the size on the description."
5,A Good read,"Mr. Ganguly has written a consice book that's quiet readable in a few hours and provides a good overview of the issues. The book doesn't go into details of ""what"" as much it goes into ""why"". His analysis adds nothing new. Book contains some interesting documents in the appendix; letter of accession of Kashmir to India, UN resolutions of 1948, Tashkent and Simla agreements etc. etc. The books covers upto 2001 and the last year probably is not well researched. If you haven't read or are new to this issue, this book could be a great starter."
3,Certainly not the whole picture,"This was my first book on this particular subject, and while it covered quite a bit of information, it left a great deal to be desired. One issue I had was the bias of the Indian author. Over and over again, he harped on the inability of Pakistan to understand how superior India's military was compared to theirs. That may be a fact, but if you follow that argument to it's logical conclusion, then the U.S. would have certainly won the war against the Vietnamese. I also feel like he downplayed the religious and cultural animosity between Hindus and Muslims, and he only made a passing reference to the fight over water rights between Indians and Pakistanis. The book was worth reading, but I am sure there must be other books that provide a more balanced and complete view of the conflict between India and Pakistan."
2,Exciting adventure-romance,"This is second book in the Deliverance Company mercenary series, between Someday Soon (Cain's story) and Moon Over Water (Jack's Story), about unscrupulous but likable heros who rescue victims of third world terrorists. I wish I had realized that this was a series so I could have avoided reading the books out of order!Adventure romances are a refreshing change of pace for me, and I really found myself on the edge of my seat while reading. The torture of victims and killings were told in rather gruesome detail, but all-in-all, an interesting and exciting story."
2,Sooner or Later,"This was not the usual Debbie MaComber book. I read her books because I am sick of reading ""sex"" novels and this one was just a tad too graphic for me. She could have handled the first chapter or two much better than what she did."
3,it's classic macomber,"the plot is the usual, but i really find the ending amirable, just that i wish i knew what exactly happened to Jack... it's so irritating to have loose ends."
5,Regina Everette.......Great Character,"If I Could was a fantastic read. The books starts out very energetic. Regina Everette, finally exhales and takes her husband, mom, children and friends by surprise with her new attitude. She learns how to speak up for herself and let her friends know how petty and self centered they are. 240 something pages I read in 2 days and so will you. Trust me you will not be able to put the book down. The way Donna gives life to Regina and her 3 girlfriends who have a real heartfelt story to tell, will keep you turning pages and when they're all done, your satiated. While your here just click that buy button, you will not be sorry and if you know Donna's style this is a welcomed treat her first novel, don't be left without owning your own copy"
4,A good read...,"I really enjoyed this book. The friendship between the women was most interesting to me because their pretense is more frequently the case that many will admit to. I liked Regina. I was rooting for her. When she found herself, it was powerful. I felt sorry for her friends, Victoria and Toni. The things that they went through and their lack of self-love was sad.I was impressed with the way the writer was able to weave their past in at just the right moment. It is not often that you get to know about all of the characters in the book. Ms. Hill did not overwhelm you with their past, but just enough for you to understand where each person was coming from.All in all, Regina was such a hero. I liked her from start to finish. I think that anyone that picks up this book will come away not wanting it to end. I didn't. Good job!"
4,Had potential to be so much better,"I have been reading Donna Hill for a long time. Her BET/Arabesque romance novels are steamy, well written and very good. If I Could was her debut mainstream fiction novel. The storyline in this book was powerful and had so much potential. Regina Everette was a 40 something female who decided to get out of a bad marriage and a job she was unhappy with, and start a new career. She over came obstacles such as unsupportive friends and mother, and an exhusband who started missing his good thing. Things go well for Regina, she follows her dreams and open up a bookstore, meets a new gentleman who cares about her. She re establish her friendship with Toni and Victoria, after they are able to get themselves together. Overall, you root anc cheer for Regina to make it, because she had a lot to overcome.THe only problem I had with the book was it was so much narration. I wondered what happened to good dialogue that I am used to with Ms Hill other works."
2,Not Even Finish,"As I was reading this book I found it very interesting but cliche in some ways. Also, at times I thought I had missing pages because of the instantaneous changes. One chapter Regina's married and then in the next she's quitting her job and is already divorced from Russell. Could we have at least read up to that part??"
5,If I Could,This is a very good book. I read it in two days. After reading this book you will find yourself looking into your own life.
2,Predictable,"This book definitely had a message of which I truly respect and understand. I loved the affirmations at the end of the book.BUT...sadly I found it kind of boring and very, very predictable. The story line was very weak and again predictable.Compared to other works that I've read by Terry Mc., EJ. Dickey etc. this was not one of my best picks to read."
3,If I Could,The book was good but the book signing at Newark Penn Station Book Store was the bust. I stood at the book store for over two hours and Donna Hill never even showed up for the book signing nor called. There was a pregnant lady that Stood in\ line all that time and she was in pain for over two hours only because she wanted to meet Donna Hill.
1,please stop telling the plot of the book...,Why is that every review i have read gives away the entire plot of the book.... people the purpose of this is to write a review... not give a book report...
3,"It was okay, I guess","Not only did the main character, but all three women in this book suffered from extreme low self esteem. I was happpy that they all decided to look at themselves and identify and admit they had problems. This was the first step to recovery. Donna Hill switches from one character's point of view to the next like clockwork. It was sometimes confusing and I had to go back a few pages just to recall which character was which. This was my first time reading her work. I'll be very selective in reading other books by this author."
3,Turn back the hands of time,If I Could made you think if we could only turn back the hands of time . What would we have done differently ! Each of the three good friends had their crisis in their marriage to bear !We had a very good discussion in our bookclub meeting ! Each discussing our own view points on each of the friends situations ! The readers guide proved to be helpful ! However each of us had our own opinion about the situations ! Some us did not agree with Regina while some did !We understood the situation but .... was divorce really the answer ?
3,THE REMIX IS WAY BETTER,"DID YOU SEE THE VIDEO CLIP ON BET OF "" HOLD ME,REMIX"" WITH THE GREAT KOBE BRYANT? IT'S A MUST. THE SONG, THE BEAT AND THE LYRICS. EVERYTHING GOES TOGETHER.BUY THE REMIX NOT THE ORIGINAL SONG, YOU'LL LOVE IT."
1,Essentially useless.,This umbrella does a poor job of reflecting light onto photography subjects. A piece of foam board with a shiny surface that you can buy at Home Depot works far better.
5,a major talent who shines brightly here.,"I was just listening to clips of Kelly Osbourne, a dreadful vocalist, one who has milked her last name and family connections for all it is worth, and who has no unique style of her own. I'd rate anything of hers 1 star.In contrast, here's something by another vocalist from a pretty well known musical family. The difference here, of course, is that Rufus Wainwright has talent, and lots of it. In fact, I'd argue that he may be one of the greatest living vocalists we have right now. His voice has real depth. And he uses this gift to great effect on a series of very well crafted songs. I can see myself listening to this fine recording for years to come. And I suspect that he'll be around for years to come, as well."
3,Okay dokay,"when the product arrived, unfortunately the case was cracked and the double disc plastic was broken. I bought it for a coworker and had to find a last minute solution. I had to use another case from another CD."
2,Boaring,Good voice lyrics and instrumentals but after two listening of the CD that's it for me.If he could only open his mouth when he sings his music would be perfect.He sings like a drunk guy who's gonna fall to sleep on his piano.I feel like falling to sleep too listening to his mumbling words.
1,Quite possibly the most pathetic cd i've ever listened to,"I have never heard such horrible sounding music, if you wish to call it that at all. I would have taken a hammer and smashed this album into little pieces if i thought it was worth exerting the physical energy to do so, Instead i slipped into the garbage disposal on the way to the frig, because i was hungry. I figured its so much easier for a fabulous invention to do something positive. not to mention the slanderous lyrics about jesus , that is not cool. it must be nice to be mr. wainright if he even deserves a mister to come from such a privledged musical household and choose to use his incredible talents in such a meaningless destructive fashion, its quite a shame. hopefully on his future works he can express something beautiful instead of hateful."
5,Wow,"After the preening, overwrought narcissism of Want One, Want Two's simplicity, humilility, wit, and easy complexity have won over a listener who worried Rufus had been forever lost to the world of Elton John-ian excess."
1,Watery,"All the songs did not play on my copy, so I returned it. However, the songs that I DID hear were not up to what I expected from Rufus. They all seemed to be the same song. I was disappointed. I still admire Rufus, But I will listen to clips before I order another album of his."
4,beautiful,"This album has some of the saddest songs - The Art Teacher, This Love Affair, and Waiting for a Dream. The sort of songs that you can put on Repeat for hours.The Art Teacher is especially poignant for anyone who has had similar experiences.Waiting for a Dream has spectacular imagery:""Diving through the rising, through the rising waves of nightKeeping a reflection of you in hindsightBut in turning back the brackish waters will not reflect youAfter you have turned the color black of death or something like that...""also""There's a fire in the prioryAnd it's ruining this cocktail party..""This Love Affair is particularly mournful, but has some odd lines like ""I don't know why I'm watching all these white people dancing"" (although that means, to me, that watching white people dancing is a pathetic waste of time)And as always, I love the classical and opera influences."
1,Self got the better of him,"With each of his first three CD's, Rufus improved on the previous one. I absolutely love his Want One, but with Want Two he succumbed to every listener's fear - he did this CD for himself, not for his listeners. There is nothing on this CD for me. Perhaps I can use it to put under a wobbly table leg. I think Rufus is immensely talented, but he really wasted it here. I hope that his future work has something for the rest of us again."
4,Bold Statement,"Yes, this is a bold statement watch. The contrast of the white details on black face, shiny stainless steel case, and black strap with white stitching make this a watch stand out. It works very well as a casual piece with a dress shirt and jeans, but also as a great accessory with a suit. The case is a true 46 mm round, but it's the thickness that really adds the weight.I only have two complaints. First, on the thick casing, ""INVICTA"" is etched onto the side. It would be classier if it was kept plain and under-stated. My other complaint is that after a couple weeks of daily use, the leather band has started to fray/ flake, but this is very small so far. The band is not made from a single piece of leather, but is layered The outer black leather is soft and rubs against the buckle clasp, causing it to pill-up. Other than that, it has been a great purchase so far."
1,Big Watch Face,The watch looks great. The watch face is so big. The face is so big it will cover you whole wrist. If you like people to notice you this Watch is for you.
4,nice watch,i was looking for something more extravagant but it's a decent watch if you want attention from the ladies. Nice watch for a young man.
5,Excellent,A beautiful big watch with great quality and nice details. Feels high-end all the way and looks amazing. Very nice price too. Highly recommended!
4,lefty,"muy padre reloj, me gusta mucho por ser lefty, algo fuera de lo notmal, no me gusta que sea chico en tamaño, pero esta ok,"
4,Very large watch!,"I bought this for my teenage son for Christmas. When it arrived (very quickly and extremely well packaged all the way from America) I thought - what have I done, its the size of a small alarm clock and considered sending it back!When he opened it on Christmas day he was delighted with his present.Be very aware that this is not a subtle watch in any way shape or form !Saying all of this it seems to be very good quality with loads of buttons and dials, he loves it and that is what matters really isn't it?"
2,Photos are misleading,This is going back!! Amazon shows the side of the watch with the crown but not the side with **INVICTA engraved in big letters**. Ugly.Foolishly I bought this watch after reading the measurements and that it is a bigger watch but it's HUGE. I think I have an average size wrist and this thing looks ridiculous on it. I wanted to see how it compared to my other watches and I drew out the dimensions on paper and it didn't look nearly as big as it is. I think the size of it makes it look like cheap toy and that's just my opinion but be warned it's probably BIGGER than you think if you aren't familiar with the brand.
2,Hudge!,"This watch is beautiful, BUT way too big. I have a Panerai Luminor and it looks much bigger. The dials are not as simplistic as the Panerai and as a result so it looks too busy."
1,enormous watch,I'm very disappointed - I purchased it as a gift and watch turned out to be too huge. There should be clear information that watch is oversized.
5,"great looking watch and fast shipper, will buy again soon",the watch looks very nice for a great price and was received within a few days. I will buy again in the near future.
4,Great Watch,This is a great watch! Im a righty and this is a lefty watch. I was worried about how it would fit but no trouble there. It fits well and looks great. This is my first leather band watch as Im not a fan but it may have changed my mind about that. I get tons of compliments! This watch is well worth the price and I would definitely recommend purchasing it.
3,Identity crisis,"I really like the Lefty chronographs for their design. But can someone explain to me why so many of the designs look identical but only to defer in model numbers and also prices? I know some has a slightly different numericals but aside from that, they are identical by looking at the pictures! It is just like Luminox as well, they come out with so many fancy names, Navy Seals, Special Ops, F16, but many look almost exactly the same. It is simply an excuse to come out with a new model, not really a new design. Also, how can something that supposedly retailed for over $500 be sold for $120? If you wear a watch for distinction, I don't think this qualifies."
5,cause - it's all love,"soft ...this man has jazz in his body n blood, I just love it, he doesn't sound like anybody else!my own favorites on this cd are:*dont start none*love body*homegirl*rise & shineI might write down all the songs as my favorites.but I'll pick these 4...I recomendate you all to buy it, listen to it , and just chill with it.Y'all going to love MIKAH9"
5,"Entertaining, awe inspiring and full of joy! Bonus: A quick read!","The novel is based on the author's life during and after the loss of her grown son to cancer. In the book, the main character's son, a lawyer, was writing a novel before he passed away and asked his mother to write it for him after he was gone. He promised to help her by sending her encouragement and direction from beyond. Now, before you start thinking, ""Oh God, not another one of those incredibly sad, weepy books,"" let me stop you. True, the book is well written and parts may have you fishing around blindly for the tissue box. But many sections are laugh out loud comical. Most of it is awe inspiring. Marion, the main character,fumbles through college writing classes, struggles with computer illiteracy and wrestles her own self doubt to the ground in an attempt to write the book her son always wanted to write. This is a book about blind, mad, crazy hope, perseverance and the pure joy and revelation that can shine through it all."
5,The Best Band of It's Type and Time,"The eighties saw a plethora of synth-based UK duos: Soft Cell, Pet Shop Boys, Eurhytmics, Tears For Fears, Erasure. To my mind, OMD were the best.They were an act that split their success between England and the US. Basically most songs before If You Leave were hits only in the UK. After that, their main success was in the States. The last few tracks are from a reformed but largely uninteresting period for the band, and includes Dream Of Me, based on Barry White's ""Love's Theme"".OMD produced gorgeous melodies - witness Souvenir - as well as simply great pop anthems like Locomotion (Not the Little Eva/Grand Funk song - this one includes the lyrics ""crossing every ocean for the sake of an emotion""). You'll be surprised (pleasantly) by the number of songs from this collection that you'll recognize and enjoy."
1,"1 star for the CD, not for the band...","If you have ""The Best Of OMD"" CD already, you're much better off NOT getting ""The OMD Singles"". ""The OMD Singles"" contains almost all the tracks from ""The Best Of OMD"" plus tracks from albums afterwards. Not exactly a smart move on the record label's part..."
2,THE SECOND INCOMPLETE RECORD COMPANY CASH-IN,"It's bad enough that the record company left off the Dazzle Ships singles on the first ""Best Of"" in 1988 yet somehow added some 12"" mixes. Now it's happened again on this release. Only one single from ""Universal"". This is incomplete for a second time. What a mess, Virgin Records. Great tunes on it, but little reason for US fans to buy it who don't already have the 1988 ""Best Of"" and don't want to shell out expensive import prices for 1996's UK-only ""Universal""."
4,Better music than singing voice,"I just recently listened to the 'Best of OMD' CD from my brother's old collection, and since most of the songs are there, I believe I can review this CD. After listening the first few tracks, I wondered why I never heard about this band before, since I believe they have a distinctive synth-techno-newage style, which is brewed into some really good music. However, I think in many songs, OMD could have done without singing. The few acceptions include 'Forever live and die' and 'La femme accident', which is not on this singles CD. Surprising, because it definitely is one of the best in the 'best of..' CD. Other good tracks are 'Electricity'(a touch like Jean M. Jarre),'Souvenier','Joan of Arc' and numbers 9 and 11. Overall, I think this collection deserves attention for its good variational music; especially in today's age, with so many popularized mediocre and shallow artists."
3,"Nice Collection, If You Don't Already Have It","This is another colelction of OMD singles but this colelction continues the colelction even after Paul left the band. If you're a fan the only thing this might have you don't already have are some single versions of the later songs. Otherwise this is a collection of songs you probably already own. If you own the best of from a decade or so earlier then you might not be interested in this. This is an album to check out at the library, not spend your money on."
2,Money Money Money,"Shame on Virgin for cashing in again. I realize ""Dreaming"" (God only knows why) was a minor hit in the U.S., but to leave off ""Genetic Engineering"" or ""La Femme Accident"" is criminal! While it's good to see the older singles digitally remastered, this compliation is just 1998's ""In the Dark: The Best of OMD"" redux. It only has one single from the last (and brilliant) OMD album ""Universal,"" and lacks the best single from the ""Sugar Tax"" sessions: ""Stand Above Me."" By all means, try to get the full-length cd's for the more experimental and unusual OMD tracks."
5,You cannot miss this CD!!,"Trying to put 20 years of hits into 1 CD is quite task, but this collection is a classic signature to the brilliant career of OMD. All tracks are digitally remastered and sound excellent! From 1979-1998, you won't find a bad song on this disc!!!"
4,Great CD,I heard this during my Europe trip in November of 2003. There is something about this CD that I really love. He uses a lot of analog synths and filters. Very cool beats and grooves.
3,Electro de verdad,"Esta de moda usar etiquetas musicales, hoy en dia a cualquier tipo de techno (o llamese electronica) le llamamos electro. Creedme, este directo es ELECTRO de verdad. Este album recopila algunos de los mejoraes temas de sir.anthony. En algunos momentos se me hace pesado, igual si fuese un poco mas rico en sonidos.... Ello no quita la fuerza con la que anhotny nos cautiva, su acertada forma personal de ver este genero musical tan antiguo. Si os gusta la musica oscura este es vuestro disco. Y recordad cerdos, que el electro es padre del techno y del hip-hop... Y si no preguntad a Bambaataa o Kraftwerk ¡"
4,Vol 2,"The Bruce Jones story line continues here. And it is just as good as in the previous volume. The story and art continue its level of quality and this one, like volume one, has some nice turns to it."
4,80's heavy metal at its finest.,"horrible name, most excellent album. not many know about this record, and its a low down dirty shame. Rockers: Title track, Rock the House, Young Blood, Jump the Gun, Savage Heart. A definite must-have if you find yourself NOT getting off on ""Slippery when Wet"" time and time again. the music these mofos make is so powerful it makes jon bon jovi look like edie brickell. ROCKS."
3,Good find for 80s hair metal lovers,"Well crafted and incredibly produced if somewhat goofy melodic metal. Think Europe with a harder edge. ""Jump the Gun"", ""Young Blood"" and ""Savage Heart"" are about as good as any of the MTV Headbangers Ball hits from the lates 80s, except this album was not widely released until 1990 at the end of the metal era. Ronnie Atkins vocals on many of these songs are among the best ever in metal, and worth buying this CD for that alone."
4,Customer Reviews on this one seem very divided,"Having just finished this book and having read all of Minette Walters other thrillers, I was intruiged by the reviews - this is a love it or hate it book. I loved it, but I have to admit it was very differently put together from previous books. Minette Walters does not write to a formula, her characters are very British and stereotypical they may seem but I have to say I certainly recognised them. The Echos of Michael Deacons life in the lives of the other characters was masterful."
3,Decent Book,This is the first book I read by Minnette Walters and I liked her writing style. The plot was somewhat far fetched and sometimes confusing. The characters were not the most likable and there were some drawn out parts. It wasn't a total waste of time but not a page turner.
4,Another page turner from the author of The Ice House.,"Ms. Walters' plotting and character development only gets better with her latest novel, The Echo. I wasn't able to put it down for the last 2 days! Not only were the main characters unique, but I felt an affinity for all of them, both in spite of their foibles and because of them. The unique plot twists kept the story moving at a fast pace without losing me. The protagonist of Deacon is a memorable one and I hope he make an appearance in a future novel. Ms. Walters has not disappointed this fan! If anything, she will make the wait for her next novel all the more difficult."
5,"Great characters, living and dead...","I've never read anything by this author before and was pleasantly surprised to discover her. I thought this was a brilliantly-written novel. For me, good characters make for good reading and this novel is chock full of them, even' the dead ones - the ""ghosts"" in the machine, so to speak.I must say the plot was a bit convoluted, and I felt myself constantly pushing away cobwebs to get back to it, but the characters - especially Terry, the 14-year-old 'derelict' and his mentor, the kind of anti-hero, Michael Deacon - kept me turning pages. I loved the old Jewish lawyer and the pudgy pervert and photo expert. Everyone had flaws, pecadillos, like real people. I am so sick of these novels in which people are sort of romanticized, or glorified. This one is, in the parlance of media hype, ""gritty."" PBS should do it. It would provide work for a number of fantastic British actors.]"
1,Not her Best,"Her earlier books are better. The main characters in the book were boring and the way subject of homelessness was dealt with, it felt preachy."
2,Complex or just confusing?,"After having read Walters' three previous mystery novels, I was really looking forward to this one, but was very disappointed. About three-quarters of the way through, I realized that it wasn't going to get any better, and I completely lost interest. I kept waiting for something to happen to tie the whole thing together, but I never found it. (I will admit that I was so eager to get finished with the book that I may have missed something significant in the last part of the novel.)C'mon, Minette, you can do better!"
4,Better than some,"I came to this book with some trepidation. I don't like Walters' tendency to explore sadomasochistic themes; she seems to revel too much in them. But this one was a bit gentler. Yes, there was evil-doing, but it was leavened with learning, poetry (William Blake's). One of her better efforts."
2,Echo was false for me!,"I purchased my first Minette Walters novel with great anticipation. The book cover and back were dotted with outstanding commercial reviews! However, my own read of this book was substantially less impressive. Ms. Walters narrative was so engrossed in UK slang I frequently lost focus on the plot to figure out the use of the slang. Her style of writing using what appears to be ""real"" non-fictional investigative info pieces along with letters written between some of the main characters towards the end of the book and intertwined with the standard writing style of a mystery writer for me was disjointed. I was glad to get through it and move on to the new Tom Clancy! Sorry, Ms. Walters - it just didn't work for me!"
1,Too bad you do not have a no-star rating,I am eminently grateful that I obtained this book at the library and did not buy it. The most positive statement I can make about The Echo is that the first 65 pages of this book were the best soporific I EVER took in my life.
1,"If you want to get a headache, I suggest reading this book!","I was a fan of this author, but she may have lost me. The most convoluted mystery I recall reading in a long, long time. So many characters. So many flashbacks. So many twists and turns. The author has a few scenes about a lady in South Africa...and I still can't figure out her connection with the plot. Like Patricia Cornwall, I suppose Minette Walters can screw up once every few books - but it is a shame after her previous books which were all terrific!I will say to her credit, the lady can sure write prose"
2,Tedious reading,"I'm so glad this was not the first effort of Minette Walters for me to read or I would never have read a second and would have ultimately missed out on a wonderful writer. In The Echo Walters has, as usual, developed characters who truly are characters. However, to follow this book one would do well to create a flow chart to track the characters and their aliases and/or their sins. I was so thoroughly confused that by the time the book ended I felt that I had wasted my time reading it. Tracking this story was a form of torture that I could have done without."
1,Walter's the Echo does not live up to her prior standards.,Minnette Walter's previous books were true page turners. At the end of each the reader could not be sure beyond a reasonable doubt if the protagonist was guilty of a heinous murder or wrongly accused and maltreated. In the Echo there is no reason to care. Words on the page seem to go nowhere and there is no story or character about whom to care. This book went straight to the re-sale shelf of the local library in the hope of saving someone else the agony of buying such a disappointing hardback novel. Save your money. Don't wait for the paperback version. Even $6.95 is too much to spend for this no-goer.
5,sinister and foreboding,"Swift's poetry is at once erotic and playful, sinister and foreboding. It reads like Georgia O'Keefe's stranger paintings. Hot with death and cold in passion, he plays with the reader, manipulating us ... but does it feel good"
1,Nut Chopper,"The ""treads"", that keep the top on the bottom, weren't not manufactured correctly, so the top wouldn't stay on properly!Disappointed big time..."
1,junk,I got this to replace the one that I am always borrowing from my mom. It's looks just like hers from 30 years ago. Too bad it is so cheaply made. Tried to crush chocolate chips this morning and the metal grate and the metal tongs are all bent up now and don't line up anymore. Don't waste your money.
1,horrible,the tines that actually do the chopping bent all out of place after only a couple uses. I wonder if the other models that are similar in appearance would hold up any better?
1,"Very low quality, keep looking",This product didn't last through 2 batches of nuts. Save your money and keep looking. Even for sub $10 this is not worth the money.
3,A few good phrases,"This is a one hour CD containing 10 lessons/categories of phrases.The best lesson in the CD is the numbers. They speak the numbers in small groups which (as proported by the CD) does make it easier to learn. The worst part about this CD is that you don't practice the initials/finals of the sounds in Mandarin or learn to hear the tones. However, if your pronounciation is --Exactly-- like the speakers, then you will be understood.This CD carries a few good phrases and is a good starter on Mandarin. A leaflet on the basics of Pinyin with all the phrases on the CD in pinyin are included in the CD. You will pick up a few words, but you won't be a conversationalist by the end of the CD. In order to learn the phrases, you have to listen to the CD over and OVER. So plan to play this in your car a few weeks before going to the airport."
1,Don't waste your money,I own this and have found it to be almost useless. There are many free resources that are far better. Almost any of the other similiar products available through Amazon would be better. This product gives a very rapid fire one time recitation of Mandarin phrases. Very few people can learn a language that way. Certainly don't think that you are going to learn anything meaninful on your flight over to China!
2,Chinese phrase CD,"I have used this product in my car to review my Chinese that I learned in another course. This coursebook only has the Pinyin transcription which is Manderin, which is the official Chinese used in Beijing. If you do not pronounce it correctly or if you have not learned the phrase, you cannot point to the Chinese characters which are practically universal in China. The course should have had both. Shanghai uses Wu, Hong Kong uses Cantonese."
5,Best Available,"Yes, the 1600's versions are more expressive and complete, that being said this is the best available alternative. Freiday captures the logic and simplicity of Quaker thought as expressed by Barclay. I believe George Fox would be very pleased with the version."
1,"Freiday's Apology, not Barclay's","Robert Barclay's Apology for the True Christian Divinity is required reading for any serious student of historic Quakerism. Unfortunately Dean Freiday's attempt to paraphrase it in ""modern English"" contains so many mistakes that there is no point in using it for anything except the footnotes (which do sometimes provide useful background information about earlier authors whom Barclay cites). The way to understand Barclay is to read an unaltered text of his original wording..."
1,"This book is simply wrong, and the original is not hard to read","Freiday's book is condensed, garbled, and misrepresents Barclay in significant ways. It has very good footnotes, and more importantly, it has section and subsection headings, which Barclay's original lacked.If you can only have one, do not buy Freiday's book. Buy the Quaker Heritage Press edition of the original text. Then buy a pad of Post-Its and start flagging pages.If you can afford two, buy the QHP original to read, and Freiday's version to explain the esoteric references.There's no point in reading a shortened and twisted version if you want to know what it was that Barclay thought. Barclay is not hard to read. He is certainly 17th century wordy, but Freiday's watery interpretation doesn't do the trick.There were passages I puzzled over for years in Freiday's book that became crystal clear when I read what Barclay actually wrote."
4,C of the C is a very good story!,"""C of the C"" is a strong, deep, heartfelt story of promise, faith and hope in the world's children at a time when our beloved, doomed earth and all its inhabitants have become victims of ""The Crisp."" [Paul's first book.] the ""C of the C"" begins with the 50 children zooming through space with robot pilot 1-AN. This is not your standard science fiction book, fighting some unknown external force, but confronting the conflicts within ourselves. Throughout their confined turmoil on the ship, the children hold their faith in God and in a new world. Sui-Ling, aged ten, and wise beyond her years, is the savior of the group. And four children who suffer from the crisp are reborn. Finally, 4 year old Kendra represents the innocence and freshness in all of us. We will return to where we began?to innocence.The story really held my interest right from the beginning.(...)"
5,Better than I thought,"I'm a Twisted Sister and Dee solo career fan. When I was listening for the first time this cd I was truly dissapointed because I did't like how this album sounds, too ""underground"", too melodic, too ""for my little sister"", too ""to keep in the same pop-cheesy-boring collection"". But I was wrong. At first, you need to consider the moment or when and under what circumstances this album came out. Second, you should give a second opportunity to listen carefully the whole cd. Well, at this poit you can realize the real quality and the great way that this work was designed and perfomed, and of course, you'll see the talent in every instrument played and the Dee vocal performance is outstandind. So, if you know or like this kind of music, or if you have ever followed the Dee Snider Career, you must have this CD."
4,Desperado - 'Ace' (Angel Air),The same release that the U.S. label Cleopatra had put out (see my review) around the same time of Twisted Sister's Dee Snider's 1990 shelved title that Warner Brothers refused to put out when it was first recorded. Just with entirely different art work.
5,nice product,read the book so i needed this cd to add to my collection. Im glad i was able to find it here on amazon. dee re did some of theses songs while he was in the band widowmaker.
4,Good,"The CD is good, and I enjoy a lot of the songs on it, especially 'We Got The Beat' among all the others with lead vocals by children. Jesse McCartney, for an eleven year old, has a sweet pure voice in Sugar Sugar.However, the adult lead vocals tend to get annoying and shrill. I bought this CD for the childrens vocals and I hope that in the future the Sugar Beats will do more songs with the actually kids in them."
2,This is SO Laughable.... lol lol lol lol,"OK, this CD deserves 1 star for being good for LITTLE (WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY LITTLE) kids and the other star is just cuz jesse McCartney from Dream Street sings Sugar, Sugar on it."
3,Great Songs Poor Covers,"Why are Bob Dylan covers often so oversung, overplayed, and overpolished? The one exception is original backup singer Regina McCrary. 3 stars only because these songs deserved acknowledgement and the commentary was basically ok."
1,Big Disappointment,"I'm a fan of Dylan's gospel music; but this dvd was nothing but boring. If you have the cd; there is no point in buying the dvd. It doesn't make it a documentary simply because you film people recording a cd! For anyone interested in Dylan's gospel period; i would recommend instead; Bob Dylan 1975-1981 Rolling Thunder and The Gospel Years. This dvd has about fifteen very revelatory interviews on this entire period of time. This would include Dylan's Bible Class teacher, producer, and background singer. Along with a lot of great music."
4,Lots of Fun,"This is the second book in the Vicky Bliss series by Elizabeth Peters and a lot of fun to read. It is not so intense as the first one as it does not have so many arcane references in it. I started this series after having completed all the Amelia Peabody books written (thus far) and I am not at all disappointed in it even when comparing it to that wonderful series.In this episode, Vicky goes to Rome to track down the maker of fraudulant antique jewelry. She thinks that the fake jewelry is being made to replace pieces in various museums so the museums will not notice that the real pieces have been stolen, but quickly determines that there is more to the story than that. She meets a smooth con artist, Sir John Smythe, along the way and they become something of an item, although both fight the temptation to act upon their attraction. Peters does a good job of keeping the romance light and it is secondary to the main mystery.Looking forward to the third entry in the series."
3,Street of the Five Moons Review,"While this book made for a good read, and has enticed me to want more, I found the ending to be a bit abrupt. The Character Vicky Bliss is in a terriable crunch and all the sudden we shift gears to the sumation wrap up."
5,it is definitely one of my favorite books of all time,"I checked out this book from my school library a few years ago, and loved it. It was the first 'Vicky Bliss' book that I read, and since then have bought all the others. I have been trying to find a copy of this book that I can buy, but have not had luck so far. This is definitely a wonderful book, and displays all of the wit and humor that is in all Elizabeth Peters books."
3,An Early Work.,"Street of the Five Moons by Elizabeth Peters is interesting in that is an earlier work, 1978 to be exact, and reading it showed how the author has grown over the years. Victoria Bliss, expert in medieval art gets mixed up with European art forgers. She is attractive, intelligent, well educated, but looks and sounds like a Vegas showgirl. Anti-hero John is an interesting mix of English aristocracy and modern crook, some of the dialogue between these characters is hilarious."
5,Street of the Five Moons,This was the first Vicky Bliss mystery I ever read. I found it very fast paced and enjoyable. I love Vicky's sense of humour.
3,"OK mystery, but nothing special","An OK read, but hard to take seriously a heroine so foolish as to repeatedly put herself in danger for little reason. Some excitement, but not really a page turner (little is at stake and not much reason to care about the characters). Hard to see how so many gave it 5 stars when there are so many much better mysteries out there (by this author and others)."
4,Quite enjoyable,"I was a little weary of this at first, not knowing much about the author or his numerous works. However, I was quickly and easily enjoying the fullfilling story. Has a bits of everything all innertwined with an interesting and not too complex plot. Will read this author again, no doubt. I would receommend this book to anyone wanting an enjoyable read."
1,Too heavy,"We bought this vacuum about 2 years ago and rarely use it. The vacuum is way too heavy...and we're in relatively good shape. You will never want to carry it up or down stairs.As of today, the vacuum stopped sucking things up...so now I have a heavy vacuum that doesn't work. I would not recommend this vacuum."
4,The SUV of vacuum cleaners...sans power steering.,"This is the vac for people who like exercise. I'm referring to using the hose option. One really has to pull to get it to extend. But a person certainly can't say it's cheaply made...the hose that is. And the dirt cup is considered by many to be small...that's so you can stop and rest...it's good that's it's on the small side. If a person got off their cell-phone and vacuumed every week they couldn't tell that it was on the small side, so there.Hoover closed their Ohio Headquarters and Amazon apparently is helping them move to Texas by selling their inventory at great prices. Thanks Amazon, now I won't have to lug this vac up and down the stairs, being that I now have two."
1,Should be less than zero,"lasted less than a month. Collection container too small. Wand doesn't stay locked into place, comes loose and smack! the whole sheebang into the leg .. or foot...Looks cool..as long as it just standing in a corner."
4,"Love it, Doesn't lose suction","I have been looking for a vacuum that has no filters to change ever. My last bagless had 3 different filters and every time one got just a little dirty I lost all suction. Not to mention the yearly expense with all those filters. This Vacuum is great, very powerfull. When I am done it really feels like my house is clean. I Love the digital carpet and bare floor settings - very convenient. The dirt cup is small but I just empty it every time I vacuum. I have a cat and dog and it picks up the Pet hair great. Highly recommended!!"
2,close but no cigar,bought this when it first came out versus the dyson. made wrong decision. dirt catcher too small and very messy to empty. filter clogs easily with dog hair. very heavy. would not let a friend buy this machine.
2,Not too good!!,The bucket is too small and make a mess every time we empty it. The screen in the bucket breaks easily and we've had to special order it twice (takes three weeks to arrive). Don't waste your money!!!
2,Well....it sucks and after few year now its broken,"Bought for $100 bucks at Home Depot. The idea is good, sort of a hybrid between canister and upright....but:1. it sticks when motor is running2. cord is unfortunately not spring loaded and I hated this3. its heavy4. its very difficult to fully extend to upright position5. hose finally broke, but I fixed it6. the mechanisms then let's u use it as upright vacuum cleaner broke7. while canister is good, when u take it out some dirt ALWAYS falls on the cleaner itself and floorso there is really nothing good about this vacuum cleaner aside from its price. now its finally it the garbage and I bought Dyson DC22 Motorhead"
3,Decently dazzling,"3 1/2Unable to sustain high-level compositional tension throughout the brief outing, EG opts instead to sear with brief punctuated runs."
2,Hodge Podge,"John McLaughlin is an unparalleled guitarist who has played on enthralling albums that sound like the songs featured here, sometimes with the same musicians who appear as guests. Unfortunately, aside from a distracting late-70s studio polish, McLaughlin himself seems to be the only element unifying ""Electric Guitarist."" The playlist jumps from (1) Mahavishnu-lite to (2) Santana guitar duel to (3) smooth jazz to (4) 70s fusion to (5) Lifetime-style prank to (6) Hendrix tribute before ending with (7) some kind of forerunner to New Age jazz. This album may be a nice portfolio for McLaughlin's work, as the cover promises, and some of the guests manage to add something new (e.g., Carlos Santana, Patrice Rushen, Jack Bruce). But how often will you be in the mood for all of those styles crammed up against each other? Instead, buy the original albums that McLaughlin revisited here."
5,Very Helpful Text,This is perhaps THE best book for teaching physicians the psychosocial side of primary care. It is nicely targeted at the challenges that residents and PCPs face daily offering practical ideas for action and wise counsel for understanding patients.
4,Not SACD format,"Caution the item is not in SACD format as listed.I ordered it because of the format, disappointed when I received the CD.Musically the CD is great."
3,Not a Huge Fan,"I use the DK-17M on a Nikon D2X.The DK-17M does do what it says. It will magnify your image. The difference in perceived size is really noticeable.Pros:Well made.Easy to install.Magnifies the image visibly.Cons:Fairly expensive for something simple.Doesn't come with the eye-cup.Removes the outermost portion of the frame.Focusing can be tough at times due to distortion.Even a slight smudge greatly distorts the image, need to keep clean.Overall I don't think I'd buy this product again. Some people love it but I just can't say I'm one of them."
2,"Returning it, minor change is minor","I don't really see much of a difference, certainly not enough to give up my eye cup for. It works ok with glasses, but better without, you can see everything ok if you shift a millimeter in any direction, I just don't see enough of a change to warrant it. I was hoping it would enlarge the viewfinder for manual focusing in a studio environment, but i'll spend the money on a focus chart instead"
2,don't buy this if you are wearing glasses,"The magnifying eyepiece works nicely and the viewfinder enlargement you get is great, but if you are wearing glasses, you will only be able to see the middle of it. Personally, I couldn't see anything past the autofocus sensor array. So I can only recommend this item to people who are able to press their eye to the viewfinder. This also explains why Nikon did not make this a default in their cameras."
2,Not what I expected.,"Wow, the headband on this skull cap is cutting off mycirculation! It is way too tight for casual wear. Also,the fabric on top is almost as thin as panty-hose, andyour hair will poke through if you have a buzz-cut like me.If you're not an athlete, then don't buy this skull cap.It's meant primarily for bald football players to wearunder their helmets."
2,Poor craftmenship,"the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face. However, the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that I first used it. It hasnt torn completely...yet. Nevertheless, I would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon. I wouldnt suggest this product"
4,Not Under Armour,I gave this as a gift to somebody and it is excellent quality but its just not as cool as the same product by Under Armour.
4,my favorite fairy tales,"I was given this book of fairy tales as a child and have reread it countless times. The fairy tales are written with a wonderful style and humor and the illustrations are brilliant. It may seem old-fashioned now but I think anyone who gives this version a chance will be delighted with its clever, sharp writing. The beautiful illustrations alone are worth the price of the book."
4,Don't let Barbie steal this title and misrepresent the story to your child.,I have two inexpensive paperback copies of this well-written book. It disturbs me that there is a Barbie version of this story and no one remembers to look for the original story.
5,old fashioned stories,I have no idea why but I was given this book twice in one year. There's nothing particularly anti-feminist about these princess stories. The heroines got into trouble and had to find their solutions. I would never have picked up this book on my own because of the pink cover but it's well-written.
4,Classic Iron Wok Works!!!,"The wok works very well, the wok factory sent directions for use before they sent the wok so I would actually read them. They were clear and easy to understand. The wok has high sides that make it easy to stir vigorously without slopping stuff out of the wok. I've used it on my stove and on my grill and have had no problems, it transfers heat really well, no cold or hot spots."
2,Not too great,"I seasoned the wok as instructed, it was pretty easy. The wok interior is not very even, and it is hard to stir fry, as most the chinese food is require stir fry. when my parents brown the pork leg for the traditional pork leg stew, and pork leg become very dark, and it was a lot darker compare to when we use the stainless steel wok to brown the meat. The food don't taste as good as when we use our old stainless steel wok. Overall, it was not a good wok. I don't recommend it."
1,Worksheets are not activities.,"I was disappointed in this book because I expected at least some activities. This is merely a collection of worksheets. Nothing about this book describes a hands-on approach or ""real-world applications"" for algebra. If you're looking for better worksheets then this is the book for you. However, it is misleading to call this an ""activities kit""."
3,"Intelligently wriiten, good for a higher level","These are nice to the point worksheets (not really fun activities) which do a good job of probing the different aspects of the topics they cover. However, a lot of them are too difficult for low level students. If you are looking for something to keep struggling, uncooperative kids on task, this is not the thing."
3,Better than anything else I've seen,"The worksheets are ok... And they are organized in different ways so that the students get several different ways of seeing the problems. I'm not so sure about ""Real World Applications"". Some of the riddles are fun, but they are fairly uninteresting and irrelevant to an urban high schooler."
4,Useful,I've used several of the worksheets in the book. I personally like the graphing worksheets.It's not a bad book to have in order to complement your instruction.But you will need other resources.
4,Great Lock at a Great Price!,Take your time when setting the master combination. If you are slightly off your lock just became a fishing weight.
4,Lock works,"I've been using this lock for a couple months now with no issues. No lock is unbreakable, but this one feels to be pretty sturdy. I like that you have to push in on the shackle with the right combo entered for it to open, pulling won't open it. I see this as something that might stop a would be thief, but not going to stop a professional.Resetting the combo is quick and painless. As some have said, the key isn't very sturdy but I don't see it breaking in the foreseeable future. MAYBE if you changed the combo every day for a year.Good cheap lock and delivered perfectly by Amazon.Update: I bought a second one of these to use as a lock at the gym. I really should have tested with my current one, but I'm using it to lock up a storage closet so it doesn't really make sense to leave my stuff unlocked. Anyway, the shackle is just slightly too big to fit through the hole that the locker provides, so if you are hoping this will replace your master lock, think again."
3,OK for the price,"I bought this after just buying a ""keyed""Masterlock""with a security rating ""5""By the way,anyone that knows what this means,please tell.Anyway I have this spring house I use as a storage area& was tired of the key bit,so I decided on 175D.Ipaid about two dollars less,but the quality (or lack of) is different.Lighter and seems less secure.For the price,its worth a back-up,but you dont want to use this lock as heavy duty security.After reading the reviews, I was a bit concerned with the combination not working all the time w/o readjusting.I have not noticed this.All in all,I think there are better choices,but you can always use a mid-grade lock.If so I would recommend it,just know what you are getting."
2,Works for a couple of years,"We bought 3 of these locks foroutside gates 5 years ago. One is still working, one failed to lock after a year. The other failed to unlock after 3 years."
2,The lock itself is not bad just the way of changing the combo,The problem I have with this is not the lock itself but how you change the combo. I had one I was changing the combo on and I apparently let the key slip during the change when I tried the lock the combo I thought I had set did not work and there is no recovering from that. I have been using the Sesame lock which came out before this. It's damn near impossible for that to happen on that lock as you stick a pin in a hole not a key in a keyhole held in place by friction. The key can shift and mess up the process not so with the original. SO I have bought my last Master Lock knock off of the one that works. OH for the critic out there I did not buy them on Amazon but from Lowes.
2,Not Solid Brass - Poor Quality,"Can't tell if these are really from Master Lock, or counterfeitThe locks are not solid brass; they are just painted a brass color. I am disappointed in Master Lock, which I thought to be a reputable company, and in Amazon. A posting that lists ""solid brass"" when the item is just painted an error. Amazon needs to correct the item listing.The locks appear to close and open with a combination, so I gave the 2 stars instead of 1. Very disappointed though."
3,weak but good fit,"Fits our backyard fence well. But dials are small, hard to dial in the cold rain. I don't believe this would be strong if assaulted."
1,I am having difficulty openning the lock,Every time I try to open the lock it gives such a hard time no matter how many times I repeat
1,Not for Outdoor Use,"Lock fails within the first year. The manufacturer's ""weather ability"" claim is a falsehood. If exposed to rain or humidity, this lock will corrode and become inoperable. Dials eventually stick and become difficult/impossible to turn. Numbers will develop a crusty coating and become difficult to read. Shackle will not lock in place despite all the pushing in the world. DO NOT PURCHASE FOR OUTDOOR USE."
2,Deceptive Advertising,"This lock is stated to be solid brass but it is not solid brass, it is a brass colored coating on some unknown material.The lock itself is a good lock, but does not last as long as the solid brass lock we ordered."
3,master lock 175D,the numbers are small and were very hard to read after a couple weeks on our outdoor shed (turned the same color and had no definition). i have had to clean them and now they look okay but looks like it will have to be done frequently. the rest of the lock works really well.
1,Broke when I tried to set combination. Requires a key to reset!,"This is a terrible product. Unlike almost every other ""set-your-own"" combination lock out there, you cannot just depress the shackle and set your combination. You have to have the ""reset key"" that comes with the lock (it is the same key for all of them). Like I need some tiny key to have to keep track of in my life! Also, when I tried to set the combination with the key, some mechanism inside broke, and I was never able to set my combination."
2,An unsecure lock,"The lock looks in high quality, but the master key for resetting the combination codes is structurally so simple, cheap, and easy to be duplicated by anyone. That means that anyone can easily unlock it using a piece of metal with the similar shape. Don't buy it if you are looking a lock for good security."
5,Master LockSet Your Own Combo Lock,"The lock is great and the price very reasonable. This product qualified for free shipping yet I was charged a shipping and handling fee.So to reiterate,great product,pricing misleading."
2,Lock deteriorated over the year,"Basically echoing the other negative reviews. We have 2 of these. Basically every time I use it now it seems harder to open, I definitely won't buy this again but I gave it 2 stars as it worked pretty well for approximately a year."
2,Deteriorates outside,"I bought four of these and used them outside in various places. Some got more weather than others. But all of them, after 4-6 months became finicky. Sometimes they would work perfectly, sometimes they wouldn't open. You had to have the number lined up EXACTLY center or it wouldn't open.And the combo dials became dirty and difficult to spin.Looking for something else."
5,Great Lock,We use about 10 of these locks to secure our trailers. They work great & seem very durable. I would highly recommend!
3,Good Lock but....,It's a good lock and convenient but oil it up before putting in the weather. It gets a little stuck after rain but some oil cures this...I would have given it 3 1/2 stars but it wasn't an option.
4,Master Lock 175D,"During my 20 years in the USAF, a stronger version of this lock was avaliable and usedd. The lock's combination is easy to change, and works as advertised. The one thing I don't like is the fact that you need a tiny key to set the combination and keeping up with where you put that key may be a pain."
1,Junk,"It never worked out of the box. A piece of crap, do not buy this inferior product. Rip off item."
1,Lock failed to work after three uses -,"I bought this lock to replace an identical model lock that ""froze up"" and would not let me close the lock on my bike rack while parked at a trailhead. This lock failed the exact same way after only three uses. All of a sudden the combo I set (and had been working) stopped working when the lock was open and would not close. I tried using the included setting key to reset and followed manufacturer instructions, but still did not work. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this lock."
1,Poor quality,"Looks solid. Set my own combo but after about 2 months of use quit working, lock will not close. Tried everything, even using re-set key. Woud not recommend or buy again."
3,Great!...until it's junk,"Having owned 7 of these locks over the last 5 years I've come to rely on the warranty for replacement.The work great for a time. Do the job they are supposed to do, keep things locked. Are they easy to pick with a slim piece of metal? Sure. But I'm just helping honest people stay honest with the stuff I lock up.What I do find troubling is how often these fail, and it's usually catastrophic. As in, they no longer open and close or the tumblers are completely jammed. Happens right around the 2 year mark.We use these multiple times on a daily basis on a job site (not exposed outside, just to normal indoor environment while building is going up)."
1,More Liability than Reliable,I received this lock a week ago and have used it every day to lock up my bike when commuting. Today I had to cut it off with bolt cutters because the combination (that worked the past 4 days) would not open the lock.
2,Doesn't last long,I've used many of these locks on gates around the farm but they usually don't work well for long. The last one started being difficult to open and close after about 1 year and then after 2 years quit working all together and we couldn't close it any more. We use these locks daily and try to keep them clean with WD-40 and other lubricants. The abus brand works well and is durable. We use those on boats in saltwater for years.
1,Brass doesn't mean it'll last outdoors,"I bought one of these for my boat. After a couple of weeks, corrosion was leaking out of the bottom of the lock. After a month, there was a heavy amount of corrosion around the dials and it was essentially inoperable. I had to replace it."
2,Broke after a year,"We used this lock for a year on the front of our business. It was opened once a day. Yesterday, the entire shackle separated from the base when pulling open the lock. This does not exactly instill confidence in the ability of this lock to protect our business. I wrote masterlock to see about them honoring their ""limited lifetime warranty"". We'll see what happens."
4,I have tried several of these type of locks and this is the best I have found.,That being said you will be lucky to get over a year in the weather before the rollers are done. I keep them lubes about once every three months and one failed in a year the other about 18months. The other brands didn't last 6 months.
5,Best Lock on the Market,"This is the best lock on the market. I use the locks for my storage sheds, hunting stands, etc. I go back to this same lock time and time again."
2,Poor Long-Term Durability,"After owning this product twice, and although it was a great initially, it's longer-term durability is less than satisfactory if you use it outdoors in a temperate environment. After 2 to 3 years, all facets of the lock begins to stick and doesn't effectively maintain its locked status. Setting it up was very easy. Perhaps this product is better indoors, but I really can't comment on its effectiveness in that environment."
5,Hauntingly beautiful,"One gets lost in the music. The blending of the flute, violin and harp is just right, without placing too much emphasis on any one instrument. The melodies conjure up all sorts of fantasies of romantic nights in Old California! Simply fantastico!"
2,Not as Good as I had Hoped,"I guess you get what you pay for. There is a reason the others cost $400 and up. This unit came with all of the parts in one box with all of them rubbing, slamming and scraping up against one another. Needless to say the unit already looks like it has about 10 years under its belt. Additionally, the dust hoods up/down motion is about as smooth as 80 grit. With about an hour of adjusting it still will not self drop back down on the table. I have not hooked up the air to it yet, lets hope that goes better :-( !!!!"
2,Guard,Only fits on one side of the saw. Very difficult to install. Supposed to be 'universal' but could not get it to fit the saw we had. Finally returned it out of frustration. Would NOT recommend.
1,psi dust collector,"for the money, the PSI dust collector does not even come close to collecting even 10% of the saw dust.the instructions were incomplete.i hope i can unload this on somebody for ten to twenty dollars, but i doubt it!!"
4,Works As Advertised,"I've had this hooked up to my contractor's saw for over a year now. I screwed it into the floor of my shed, then attached it to the side of my table saw's extension table. I attached the dust collection hose directly to the blade guard. It works. It might not sense the thickness of the wood I'm putting through and automatically adjust... nor does it go down automatically (not sure if it's designed to). But it lifts automatically with a touch of my finger, and it locks in position after tightening the knob. I'm happy."
4,Good Enough For The Job,"Took about an hour to hook to my Powematic 66. For the price its a good deal. Box it was shipped was tore open but no parts were missing just scratched up (they should package better). Tiawian Manual Terrible so just use some common sense to assemble. Had to add a tiestrap at hose and blade guard to keep it level. There is a lot of sag on the boom at 50"" so I will add some support for it. Cover is nice and works fine, keeps dust from flying into my face even without vacuum hooked up. If you want the bare minimum in a dust cover then this adequate. If I would have had more money to spend I would got one of the others. The cover lifts easily to adjust to board thickness and stays put so I am happy for what I got. I have been using my saw for 20 years without a cover but I decided to reduce my risk by trying out a cover. I feel safer and cut some boards with it with no inconvenience. I use the Beismeyer splitters and this cover fits over it fine."
3,"Films: ***, DVD: *","As other reviewers have noted, the problem here isn't with the films themselves, but with the audio/visual quality of the presentation. The films on the Vincent Price disc aren't bad, but the Christopher Lee disc looks like someone video taped a TV broadcast of the movies. ""Horror Express"" and ""Circus of Fear"" are both terrible; scenes set in the dark are overexposed, grainy and look brown. ""Count Dracula and His Vampire Bride"" fares better, but it's presented in a non-anamorphic widescreen presentation. It's also worth noting that this film in particular is from the Hammer ""Dracula"" series, and while you don't need to see the previous films to follow the events of this film, you're not getting a one-off production, either.""House on Haunted Hill"" - ****""The Last Man on Earth"" - ***""The Bat"" - ****""Horror Express"" - ****""Count Dracula and His Vampire Bride"" - **""Circus of Fear"" - ***A/V quality - *"
4,Not bad for the price . . .,"Considering the price, I have to give the collection 4 stars. If you like this type of movie, it is a good buy."
4,For Peter Dawson Fans,"This is an interesting CD, but is not for somebody buying their first Dawson record. The selections do not include many of his ""greatest hits""; most of the songs are a little further down the rung, so to speak, though very well sung. Two of his best songs, ""Sergeant Major on Parade"" and ""Floral Dance"" are represented here by his first recording of them, not the later, more popular versions of those songs. It is interesting to compare them with their counterparts, though. If one has become a Dawson devotee, then this album is worth buying. Dawson is an acquired taste for an American, though. If you are not familar with Dawson's work, try another Dawson record first, and if you like it, you might get pleasure out of this collection."
5,He is on a roll!,"I found this book vey helpful in my research! Any person who is involved in collecting knives, thisis a must-have book! I also found his website, where you can order other books about knives, and also subscribe to Knife World, which I did do. It is knifeworld.com."
4,Another good book for beginning knive collectors,"One of three knife collector books I have purchased from amazon.com. A good price guide for Case, Cattaraugus, Ka-Bar, Remington, Robeson, Schrade, Winchester, and others. Also good commemorative/limited ed price guide."
1,classic rip-off,"Little has changed or been updated from the 11th edition, from the 10th edition ad nauseum. Most newer companies completely left out. Some of the illustrations appear to have been photocopied, with poor results, instead of printed. Data is out of date. When first published this was a great book. It doesn't need a new edition, it needs a whole new book."
2,Avionics Troubleshooting and Repair,"As a FAA licensed A&P; maintenance technician, I was expecting far more than the generic info that most A&P;'s receive with their training. Most of the content covered how the avionics worked. While there was some diagnostic/troubleshooting, it was at a very low level and did not go into much detail. There was a lot of text that could have been much more definitively explained with a flow chart. The normal repair info provided was to ship the possible defective unit back to the manufacturer for repair. In one word, what this book lacked is DETAIL!In all fairness to the author, avionics diagnostics and repair is not an easy subject of cover. The cover says that the audience is for Pilots and Technicians. Having two diverse audiences is probably the problem. There is probably slightly more info than what is needed by the Pilot. However, the info is highly deficient for the Technician. This book is more of a Pilot book."
3,Brits love their cats,"It seems cats in England live longer (often 20 years or more), not clear why, may be the weather but most likely because their owners understand them better. There is plenty of advise, some of it quite reasonable grounded on understanding of feline psychology. If your cat creates problems for you you will find some useful hints and observations and realize that most of the time you are at fault. Enjoy!"
2,didn't like it,"I got this item because I'm pregnant and my back hurts a lot by the end of the day. My boyfriend works with his hands as a mechanic and his fingers are often too sore to rub my back for very long at the end of the day. This item was not good for us because it's awkward to hold (if the handle portion was larger it'd fit your hand better, but it's small size defeats the purpose of trying to make it easier for your partner) and kinda feels like someone is jabbing you if you try to apply any pressure. I don't see how you could even think of massaging yourself with this item."
1,Not as advertised Omni Roller,"Saw this Omni Roller advertised at my local pharmacy and decided to go on amazon to buy it. In buying it from Body Back Company, came the photo I have uploaded. It was cheaply made and not up the quality sample at the one on display at the pharmacy which leads me to believe this is a knock off. Tag that came with product reads Massage Roller Ball by the Body Back company, which proves my point, its not OMNI. Save the hassle of buying only to return since it's disappointing and unacceptable."
5,These feel awesome!,"I discovered this product in Lamaze class and generally don't like any of the ""massage tools"" out there in the market, but my husband and I tried these in class and they feel even better than a hand massage. I ordered one and can't wait to get mine because they feel great and it takes a lot less effort for your partner to use. Definitely worth the money. They also make a mini version as well which feels really good too! I preferred this size, but my husband said the mini felt better on his back. Don't think you can go wrong with either."
2,not a fan,"so many better massage devices out there, if you have never tried one than shop around for anything else. If you love it, than buy it, why are you reading this."
3,not the best,when pregnant with back pain my husband got me one of these... felt great lightly at the store.... but after a couple uses it left bruises....we returned it.
3,Not the best out there.,"This item is about as cheaply made as it can get. The roller doesn't roll very well, even with oil. It is also very light, which is why I think the ball doesn't go anywhere. I bought this as well as a couple of the smaller rollers for my boyfriend as a gift and wish I hadn't wasted my money on any of them. I HIGHLY recommend the roller from Bath and Body Works. It's heavy duty and feels incredibly good."
3,"HELLO SOLO PIANO LOVERS, THIS IS YOUR CD.",I AM A SOLO PIANO FAN ALL THE WAY. THIS IS TRULEY A GOOD CD. THE SONGS ARE ENTERTAINING. THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE GOOD. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WAS THAT OUT OF THE 14 SONGS LISTED I ONLY LIKED 7.
3,"Keyed alike, but cheaper than other Master locks","Keyed alike is great. I had 2 keyed alike master locks with keys that looked like little housekeys. These look like sheriff keys from the civil war. The locks don't close as easy, sometimes the get a little stuck so they don't want to close. It's obvious, so you can't mistakenly leave the lock open, but it's annoying compared to the other master locks I had. I just needed 3 for storage areas rather than the 2 I had."
1,Don't Buy!,"2 keys for 4 locks?!!!!!!! Now I have to send these all back, how frustrating! I shouldn't have to find out that there's only 2 keys in the pack upon receiving them"
3,"They work, but they're a little short for my purposes","I got them to lock up my handgun in the stock handgun case and to lock my ammo boxes. They work ok in the ammo boxes, but they're a bit too difficult to use for my hand gun case due to the limited length of the lock... it's a tight squeeze and uncomfortable. They are good quality locks though... no complaints there at all."
2,"A little cheap looking, but seems ok so I'm using them","I have windows on the first floor with bars that need a lock so I had them locked, but lost the key. These replaced the other locks from 20 years ago, same brand, same look. But theses are a little cheaper looking, but seems ok so I'm using them."
3,okay for general usage.,I was looking for some cheap locks that would have the same key for ease of use. They worked okay. The only drawbacks is that there are only two keys and There are three of us to use them. And this is the kind of key that cannot be copied. I tried to get some made. They are a funky key type. So I will need to buy some others with more keys or keys that I can have copies made of.
3,Not like the old Master locks,"These were o.k. but not the best, not like the Master locks that I remember. These were not as well made as a lock that was made 10 years ago. These will work in light to med-light situations."
3,Not The Standard Black Lace Quality Story,"This book did not read like it was written by a feminine author, I have only read one other in the Black Lace series that I thought was written by a man, it made this story less erotic when I realized it seemed to be written in a masculine way."
4,Very good product.,"It works very good and it is fast, the only thing is about the cap, you can lost it very easy."
4,"If only they found a way that you can't loose the cap, or better yet, the stick","I'm on my third - the first was never returned after I lent it to somebody at a conference, the second apparently 'fell off' my key chain (with the key-ring still attached, so it did not break) and I just bought the third. All three were missing their cap within a couple of day of usage, but so far that never impacted function. If this one gets lost I'll buy another one. I had other really cheap USB flash drives that on rare occasions reset the computer, so I'm not inclined to take risks."
4,a must have item,"I love this kingston one GB data traveler flash drive ,keeps my info.and graphics clone like."
1,look elsewhere,Look elsewhere if you want an item that works properly. I bought this item recently only to discover that this 1 GB Flash Drive will not store more than 26 MB of data. I emailed Kingston dirctly and did hear back promptly but the suggestions received still left me with only 26 MB of storage.
1,Beware of the shipping cost,"It's cheap because they charge you extra for shipping. I tried to order 3, the shipping was over $26 (from Digital Media Source). I didn't go through with the order. An average shipping cost for a $300 digital camera is about $15, and for 3 tiny gadgets under $6 it's over $26? I'm sorry but that's ridiculous.Btw, I checked another place, and the shipping for 3 was over $18. Still awfully pricey.PS. Found the cheapest one sold by eek Technology. The shipping cost for 3 was $12.85. The total was $27.61. Not bad for 3 flash drives that size, so I placed the order. Beware of Digital Media Source, though."
1,Corrupted? Messages from alien planets?,"I bought this for my son after reading so many positive reviews. He didn't need anything huge and the price was right. It lasted a grand total of three uses, after which we viewed cryptic and unintelligible messages on our monitor. Since my son was using this for his school documents this was a major problem.Don't know if it's worth the money and hassle to return it (it was past Amazon's 30 days). I should have looked more carefully at the unfavorable reviews and failure rates and I'd suggest others do the same. I'll stick with the Cruzer from now on. Haven't had a problem with them.And if aliens were trying to reach us: sorry, we just couldn't make any sense of it. Try again."
3,"Good deal, right on time","I still wonder something. I ordered 2 flash drives to safe my shipping cost, but I still had to pay for 2 shipping cost???"
4,Great Purchase,"I got the product in no time, a great purchase in deed. I do recommend this seller, they gave me no hassle at all and provided all info needed."
5,You plug this into your usb port ...,"... and it just works. What more do you want? Small, 1GB, fast, simple. 'Nuff said."
4,Kingston Data Traveler 1 GB USB Flash Drive - Convenient,"I use the data traveler between 2 machines. The older of the 2 machines that I have does not have the ability to burn CD's, so I found this a very Convenient method to transfer information. I also like the ability to put the device on my key ring when I need to leave."
5,cheapest you will find,"I use these a lot for quick file transfers and temp backups, beats wasting a DVD to transfer a file or backup a report that is still in alpha draft."
2,Cheap but slow; not usable by ReadyBoost,"The Kingston 1GB DataTraveler flash drive is very cheap -- it can often be found for free after rebate. It's small and convenient, but speed is quite lacking. Copying files takes a long time. Worse, I just found out it cannot be used for Windows Vista's ReadyBoost feature (which speeds up system performance) because it's too slow."
2,"Lost cap, corrupt after 2 years.","I purchased this USB drive and after 2 years it's gone bad, says my files are corrupt, and I can't add or remove files. Not to mention I also lost the cap to it. I didn't even think they would still be making them, but stumbled across it and thought I should share my experiences. Trying to find a replacement at the moment."
2,Beware: does not work with USB hubs,"As experienced by another reviewer below, I found out the hard way that this flash drive does not work on an external USB hub. It appears the drive draws too much power for a hub to handle it, which is a total bummer. With only two USB ports I can't keep switching out devices, which is why I bought the hub. Interestingly, my whopping external CD/DVD drive works just fine on the hub. Hard to figure out why a little ole flash drive can't be handled. My SanDisk cruzer 2.0 drive works great."
3,"Great drive, a bit bulky and slow","Great little drive, but as noted in the title, the transfer rates are a bit slow. I got this free with 50 pepsi points, and it's amazing how I paid $50 for a GB in 2005 while I got this free for drinking a few cases of pop."
