1,Avoid JXYA in a Nutshell!!!!!!!,"I strongly reccomend against this book. JXTAis supposed to be a peer to peer platform, soimagine my disappointment when I read the partabout how all computers running JXTA findeach other through some hard coded IP address.Yes, computers running JXTA go there to get alist of other computers running JXTA!When I went to that address andfound only a handful of computers there, it wasobvious that nobody is taking JXTAseriously. If you need any help with JXRA, then DON'T buyt htis book; look for another!!!!!!"
2,NOT IMPRESSED BY THIS BOOK'S JXTA YEARNS,"Yes, ""JXTA in a Nutshell"" included the full JXTA protocol specification. It also, shed light on issues about how the JXTA technology fits into the standard Java group, but that's all. Its overall pattern is porous. I was disappointed by its lacklustre approach towards the otherwise interesting peer-to-peer platform. (It is not as comprehensive as I had expected). Hence, I would not recommend this text for any serious student. Joe Gradecki's ""Mastering JXTA"" offers a better value for your money. Make your choice!"
1,JXTA - save your money for something real,"Some pretty cool stuff like Java has come out of Sun in recent years, so I was expecting a lot from JXTA. The fact that this book was published by O'Reilly further raised my expectations. But, I was disappointed to find that JXTA is based upon the ""resolver"", a protocol that finds things using network broadcast storms. So, if you're like me and want to spend your time and money reading about something real, I suggest you pass on this one."
5,Unique Genius,"I must concur with my colleague, Michele Z., for her astute observations regarding Mr. Ognenovski's artistry. His subtle phrasing and amazing tone leave one breathless. Words cannot adequately describe the impression his recordings make. One must experience them to believe it. I can still hardly believe it myself.David Gilman, orchestral & solo clarinetist, Lake Forest, CA, USA"
1,Tale Ognenovski-----------musical genius,Is this a joke? this guy stinks! It's the absolute worst playing Iv'e ever heard.I ought to know because I'm a professional clarinet player.I have high school students who sound much better!
3,Love the Hi-Lo's but not so much these arrangements,"I've been a Hi-Los fan forever, but have forgotten how very dated some of their arrangements are. However, this is worthwhile just to remind us of the quality of these voices and those harmonies."
5,And this isn't the best of her,"Well... I know tha now, everybody loves Shakira... and yes, this is an amazing album...I really love Underneath your clothes and Que me quedes tu. Didn't love english version of Ojos Asi.If you like it, you SHOULD have Donde estan los ladrones, THAT IS HER BEST ALBUM... Inevitable is probably her best song... so, learn spanish and welcome to latin world.Oh... also she is SO nice... i can wait for the Tour of the Moongose DVD... and includes MEXICO City!!!! yay (i went to that concert)"
3,3/5 stars...I could listen to it!,"I got this CD on my birthday...and I enjoyed it! I got a limited edition one, with bonus tracks, and a DVD of some of the Objection (Tango) videos, live, the making of it and the one she preformed on MTV. I really didn't watch the DVD; if you didn't like the music video (or didn't see it), then I recommend buying the regular CD. I could listen to all of the songs except the Spanish ones. :P I think her voice is a little too over styled though; and sometimes you can't tell what she's saying if she's speaking in English. It sounds like she's sometimes straining her voice or she's half asleep sometimes. The songs are all good, but I don't particularly like ""A Peom To a Horse"". Who would recite poetry in front of a pony? Ahh, strange. I like ""Fool"" the best. :P"
1,mtv sellout,boring music I wish she would of change back to her old style its a disgrace how music artist change their ways just for the extra bucks.
5,Where's Eyes Like Yours??,"I know that my family and friends hate my ranting and raving but I really wish they had branched out with the DVD section and placed the Latin Grammy performance of Ojos Asi on it. Other than that little complaint I totally love this album. Been a fan forever and it's good to see it being loved in English. The MTV performance is great, a little different but worth it. That's Shakira though, you never know how her live performances are going to go, what she'll do. Buy this, you won't regret it and if you do don't sue me!"
1,awful horse movie,these dvds were awful i would give them away free the only good thing was i had some time to spend
3,not as good as I expected,"I have seen the movie Misty and that is the reason I wanted this set and it is as good as I remembered. I have watched two of the other movies and they were not good at all. They are low budget movies that fail to keep my interest and are not what I expected. Mary Smith was hardly about horses at all so that was disappointing. Having said that, I guess I can't complain too much if I get one good movie out of the deal for six bucks."
5,horse tales collection,This dvd contains 4 good horse stories for the like minded people who love anything to do with horses and the people around them
2,Horse Tales Collection,"Misty is the best movie of the four. It stands alone. Wind Dancer is pitiful, not worth your time. Wildfire is full of bad acting and a poor story. Mary White has fairly good acting, scenes and story with a sad ending. Find Misty by itself."
5,Best Hot Cocoa Mix available,"Farmers Brothers Hot Cocoa is by far the VERY Best there it is easy to mix, it taste best if you mix it first with 1/4 cup of boiling water then add 3/4 cup of hot whole Milk!"
1,French People Shouting Phrases,"The sound effects in this product are just French people shouting 16 different phrases in french. You can not record over them, but the buttons are nice and big so it's easy to hit them in a hurry. I'm not sure why they mention Jamaican sound effects in the literature, I couldn't get any Jamaican words out of it. There is a tone knob so you can change the pitch of the French voices from very low to very high. One creative feature is that the illuminated power light is positioned in the ""o"" of the word ""Power"" so you know for sure when this thing is on."
4,Dissatisfied Customer,"The product is very good and makes good listining.Unfortunately, I will not be buying any more products from Amazon because of the post purchase nuisance they have become.Inspite of unsubscribing about ten times I am bombarded with unwanted sales e-mails. Usually about seven or eight a week"
5,Wonderful!,"I discovered Ryan Farish thru my Pandora music account when I was listening to my New Age channel, you have got to get Pandora! Then I noticed that the Weather Channel plays his music too, just to let you know how popular he is. This is one New Age CD that you can actually play in your car and not fall asleep or relax too much to. It has some songs on there that actually get your adrenaline going and makes for a happy drive! It is uplifting and makes me think of being at the ocean looking out at the big blue water and seeing it crash into the rocks. Like in Northern California. It is a great CD and every song is good!"
3,Elevator Music,"This CD is okay, when you are in the mood for relaxing music. Probably won't buy this artists music again, but I don't dislike the music."
5,Talented Music,"I think that Ryan Farish stays on the same line with Jens Gad, Micheal Cretu, (Enigma). These are excelent songs for people who like Enigma."
5,What about the other musicians?,"It would be nice to pay the orginal musicians that wrote this album. My name is Jon Cobb and I am the nephew of James Cobb, the bass player for Starbuck on this album. He hasn't seen a dime from the sale of this album since it has gone on sale on Amazon.com. Bruce Blackman is not paying anyone but himself for all the hard work that the other musicians put into making this album."
4,Solid work but somewhat dated,This is a great introductory text. My only complaint would be that it's a little dated at this point. It needs to be updated in a third edition.
5,The best documentary about human brain,"This documentary is simply fantastic. There is no other similar to it. Worth buy it, because it is so informative and beautiful in the same time. I have learned a lot about the human brain with this fascinating five-episodes documentary. Believe me, if you buy this, you will never regret it. You can learn a lot too on the web site: [...]"
1,This DVD is Misnamed,"I would name this DVD: ""The Abnormal Brain From Early Childhood To Old Age"". I have learned a lot about the brain from other DVDs, but this one told me nothing about the secret life of the brain, whatever than might be. I cannot recommend it: it was a waste of my time."
1,Drama & scientific fluff,"Secret Life of the Brain.I liked the occupational therapy by Dr. Taub in Alabama for patients recovering from strokes.Otherwise, the PBS video emphasizes intense and discomforting drama, scientific fluff, and medical intervention.The video also describes the unnecessary maiming of ferrets."
3,not in the USA,"the advertising for this product says made in the USA, but the first thing you see when you take it out of the box is ""MADE IN MALAYSIA"" One of the reasons I bought from this company was USA made from non-endangered hardwoods..who knows what kind of wood this is and whether or not it was harvested with the environment in mind. :("
1,split,I bought two of these and they both split along the seams where the pieces are connected within 6 months.
1,Review of the Review,"This is an article from a February 2005 magazine which reviewed ""Qurb"" software. It appears that you might be purchasing the software, but it is only a 960 word copy of the 2-1/2 year old article. This has absolutely no value. If you are interested in Qurb, as I was, and you find any site selling it, you will get all this information including the features which have been added in the 2-1/2 years since this was written. I was totally discouraged that Amazon would ""Sell"" a reprint of an old magazine article. If you want to give away six bucks, put it in the the plate at chuch next week. You'll feel good about it. Buying this will only make you feel bad that a good company would list and sell anything so totally devoid of value."
3,"Too Complicated, Too Shallow","The problem with a 3,500 page trilogy is that it takes a really long time to start -- in fact, it takes about 500 pages. Given the ambition of this trilogy that's forgivable -- what is not is the inanity and lameness of the plot and characters and vision. Hamilton lacks the vision of an Isaac Asimov, whose overarching brilliant vision felt so truthful and visceral that it even compensated for his clunky writing. Hamilton also lacks the humanity of John Wyndham, who transported human dilemmas into science fiction settings to highlight the human condition. And above all Hamilton is not a Philip Pullman, whose imagination is truly dazzling. Hamilton is similar in many ways to Neil Gaiman and Alan Moore, and indeed ""The Reality Dysfunction"" reads like a graphic novel. Its plot is really absurd: the religious themes strike me as irrelevant and pretentious. The first part of the trilogy really is thin and trite, shallow and stupid."
4,Classic Space Opera,"This is the opening book in the ""Nights Dawn"" trilogy - although the paperback versions run to six books. It was my first introduction to Peter Hamilton, and I am sold.The book spans a grand universe with varied planets and habitats, alien races, FTL travel, and one of the key drivers of the book is the split of mankind into Edenist (bioengineered humans) and Adamists (fundamentalist creationist humans).Without spoiling the plot I can say that this book introduces the reader to a variety of characters and plotlines and sets up a compelling story to follow. There is a good mix of sci-fi technology material (organic spaceships and habitats, space ships and lasers) with primitive fantasy style elements (backward planets with low tech environments).I can honestly say I am hooked and have ordered book 2 already!"
1,SOUND AND FURY AND SAYING NOTHING...,"What a major disappointment. How this can be equated with Dune or Foundation is beyond me. Boring, embarrassingly adolescent techno-bable, a myriad of uninvolving characters in a myriad of bad sci-fi cliches.....ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. I thnk this Emergence should go back where ever it came from."
1,Ugh. Don't waste your time.,"You will not believe this if you read it. Hundreds of pages, and then, I *swear*, an honest-to-God, literal, deus-ex-machina ending.Ugh."
1,amazingly disjointed narrative,"I was quite disappointed in this novel. Although the concepts were quite unique, the narrative flow was so disorganized that I actually lost interest in the story. I think the author needs to review basic literary style 101."
1,"Poorly done, disappointing","This is a complex, multi-layered, big, BIG (did I say ""big""?) space opera in the mold of Doc Smith, but reading like a pastiche of Jack Chalker. After the first couple of chapters, it's clear that the author is in way over his head, that he just can't handle it.Cardboard characters and a contrived plotline do not an epic make.If you want to see how it should be done, read _A Fire Upon the Deep_ by Vernor Vinge."
1,The worst excuse for science fiction I've read in years,"This book is awful. I forced myself to get through it, constantly thinking it couldn't get any worse - but it did. Very thin premise, poorly veiled pseudo-religious undertones, horrible plotting, truly astounding excessive length. This book constantly fractured my suspension of disbelief. It starts pretending to be a hard science fiction novel and ends up with unexplained zombies and a trumped-up apocalypse. It simply doesn't hold together and relies on graphic action scenes and ""adult"" interludes to sustain reader interest in lieu of a coherent story line.Terrible plotting. Mumbo-jumbo terminology. Substitutes religious dogma for science. Way too long. A bad, bad, bad book. 1094 pages of bad writing. I'd give it NO stars if I could. Unfortunately I purchased the entire trilogy at the Border's Bankruptcy sale so I'm stuck with over 3,000 pages of waste paper."
1,A Shocking Disappointment,"I was shocked and disgusted when about halfway through this book, I started coming across fairly graphic references to sexual abuse, child abuse, and pedophilia, which were integrated into the story line. I threw this book away along with the second volume (unread) and I will never read anything by this author again. I feel soiled from having read this trash."
2,Not great,"The reality dysfunction part one and two was a great book. It really was fantastic ....so, why go knacker it up with two books that have almost no connection to the beginning - characters just disappear! They don't die or anything. It's like the author had no real use for them anymore.I think the author was in need of a good editor - the writing is good but something went wrong with the ideas! The story ends in the most abrupt manner... I mean, three and a half thousand pages of nothing particularly new and the massive problem endangering humankind solved in one hundred pages!I'd really like to see this work rewritten and abridged...so you end up with one (big) book that is great, rather than a jumble sale of worthless threads. Like some other reviewers, I feel ripped off.Iain M Banks is better"
4,Epic SciFi,"Great book, religious aspect questionable, inventive space ships, good character building. Only bad part i cannot purchase 2nd and 3rd part on my Kindle, somehow not available for Europe, sad!"
4,Enough About Space Opera Already - This Book is GOOD!,"I've read LOTS of SciFi books, and most are trash. Not this one. I found Mr. Hamilton's 'style' and scope intriguing and somewhat compelling. The book is difficult at points because of its 'realism', but if you can't handle adult literature, then don't read it. I put it in a class with the Hyperion books and the works of Vernor Vinge. Most of the negative reviews I read (always the most interesting to me I must admit) were either by the grossed-out or the bored. I was neither. I rarely recommend books, but this one I do. Relax and enjoy."
4,"somewhat cleiche, but still gripping","in the beginning of this book, hamilton went a little overboard with his ""techno babble"", making the mistake of thinking that prepending ""nano"" and appending ""matrix"" to words will make them sound fantastic. he seemed to get over this as he got into the book and started to substitute real creativity for fancy words.secondly, the author painted himself as a sort of homophobe, by making the only gay men in the galaxy satantic rapists, and his main character joshua calvert a super hetero stud who has his way every woman he encounters. now that's fiction.that being said, i found most of the book gripping and will be picking up the sequal soon."
5,What a book,"I'd heard that it was a great series but I'd always found the premise a bit of a put off, I have to say that I'm very glad I picked it up on a whim.By far and away one of the best sci-fi novels I've ever read."
3,Not his best work,"Having read several of Peter F Hamilton's books, I was quite disappointed with this series. It relied on too many ""happy coincidences"". This gave the plot a feeling of not having been thoroughly thought through, as though the series was written in a hurry. Hard to imagine for something so long!The multiple occurrences of unfinished sentences in the Kindle edition of the 2nd book further detracted from the work."
2,Great books; bad edition,"I love Peter F Hamilton's works, and the Night's Dawn trilogy is some of his best. However, if attention to detail matters to you, steer clear of this particular publication. The book is riddled with typos and misspellings, and in some cases the text is printed at an angle to the page. It feels careless ... the stories deserve better."
2,Space Opera turns Zombie Flick,"This book which starts out well with a deep characters and a complex society of future earth reminiscent of Dune, quickly turns into a bad B-movie which is more reminiscent of Evil Dead Part 2. While Mr. HAmilton has a gift for writing and character development, he seems to feel that all science fiction gernes can be intermixed without concern. I recommend this book only to true sci fi readers who can enjoy a book in spite of itself, or college guys looking for something to rival that last Night of the Living Dead remake you just saw."
3,Alien attack from beyond sense and reason!,"A great book about people who generally discount the invisible, only to fall prey to an enemy attacking from beyond sense and reason. I think it ironic that even now we generally tend to laugh at the concepts of angels and demons, when much of our own reality would be so well explained by their presence. So this is a book about people in the future who thought they were winning ""the game"" of life, only to find that they didn't even begin to understand the rules. Their enemies are not flesh and blood but the rulers and principalities. The battle is within the heart and mind. Their technology has failed, as has their government and culture. All they trust comes to nothing. All that stands between them and the abyss is the ability to recognize and defeat the evil within. So far they aren't doing very well."
5,A page-crunching horror space soap opera?,"How more verbose can you get? Just the first two books come to about 1000 pages, with 900+ for the sequel. Many different trails lead you to many different stories, if you don't like one, don't worry, you'll soon be reading about another one. The characters are interesting, the use of science theories is amazing (so many ideas!) and the underlining thread (yes, there is an afterlife and it has come to get the universe) is a refreshing idea in the world of hard SF. All in all a great read along with its sequel ""The Neutronium Alchemist"". Cannot wait until the third book!"
4,"CRAZY SPACY, EXCELLENT","EXCELLENTLY WRITEN, THE REALITY DYSFUNCTION BROACHES BOTH THE TECHNOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL QUESTIONS OF THE FUTURE WITH BIG BALLS.A JOY TO READ.EDENISM IS ONE OF THE MOST EXITING SCI-FI CONCEPTS EXPLORED TO DATE, AND THE STYLE IS SPOT ON."
2,A potentially great series is lost in the details,"This was a recommendation for me by Amazon.com, and it wasn't as good as I expected, but not terrible, either. The setting is well-thought-out and the characters are well presented, but there are too many of them, the plot(s) swirl(s) around too much, and there is just too much going on without the proper development at the appropriate time.I really wanted to enjoy these books (referring to both volumes) but couldn't. I think that Hamilton has great potential as a writer but needs to focus his creative energies a bit. In my opinion, these books wanted to be a ""Dune"" or a ""Foundation"" but rambled too much to hang together cohesively.This doesn't mean I will abandon Amazon.com's recommendations any time soon, but I may be a bit more selective."
3,Imaginative but too much explicit gore/sex for my tastes,"The Reality Dysfunction hooked me in the first pages with the thrilling space battle, the biotech wonders of the Edenists, the mysterious Ruin Ring, and the imaginative description of the evolution of the Ly-Cilph on a distant world. But good grief the soft core porn aspects of the novel (often involving teenage girls), plus the gratuitous graphic violence, was over the top and frankly creeped me out a little. After 200 pages I was done. I award Peter Hamilton three stars for cool and original ideas and adequate prose, but he loses two stars for X-rated sex and gore."
2,Intensely Disappointing,"A for effort, E for execution. The come on of the novel is the grand cosmic scope, yet it takes more than 200 pages to get past the scene-setting, which is far overdone. Perhaps if the characters were anything other than cardboard, and if there was a sense of forward movement or even the slightest intimations of suspense . . . The imaginative detail quickly changes from rich to atrociously overwritten. Don't believe the hype!"
2,"well written, but lack of likable characters",I read the first 900 pages of this book and stopped. I stopped because there were no characters that I really cared about. Most were sex addicted and there weren't many who had any real morals or standards. It is a chilling thought to think that this could be our future. The books redeeming quality is that it creates a very well thought out and complex universe that is both believable and real to me. Its just too bad that with all this potential he decided to fill it with a bunch of losers.
1,Don't waste your time; you'll be disappointed,"The trilogy starts out as hard sci-fi, and then turns into a poorly-constructed horror & fantasy mix. It's too long and the major storylines don't intersect in any meaningful way. You're bound to be disappointed with the quality of the ending."
5,Part 1 Emergence,"""....the first part of a two-volume book that is itself the first book of a series."" Amazon.com review.Actually, its a trilogy, which might be confusing as this is merely the first half of the first novel. Ergo, as it is pointless to ""review"" half a novel, I can only recommend that you read both ""halves"" at once.Just a sidenote: It is unfortunate that this novel is published in two ""mass market"" paperbacks instead of one trade paperback, as in the UK. Which, imho, is preferable; first, because these two volumes constitute a single movement, and then because it's a simpler and seemingly more effecient use of paper, ink and shelf space. I read the one volume SFBC edition which I heartly recommend, if you can find it.Despite axegrinding naysayers, to know contemporary SF one must read ""The Reality Dysfunction: Emergence & Expansion."""
2,A big wind up but turned into a ground ball,"So far as writing style goes I found no real problems with character development or engagement, I found the suspension of disbelief a little strained at times with some of the techno babble becoming a little repetitive. As I say to my students ""explain it once and then leave it alone"". The seperate threads of the story were to far appart initially and I felt Mr Hamilton was straining to bring them together. Some of the characters were shallow and sterotyped, examples being a drunken & despondant missionary/priest and a lecherous river boat captain (shades of Mark Twain). But I found the climax of the book to be both tedious and dissapointing, shortchanging the preceeding chapters, characters and ultimately, Me, the reader. In a nutshell, ""A pleasant trip, a pity about the destination""."
1,Boring space opera,"This book is very looong and unfortunately very boring too. It has some interesting descriptions about combat, society and life 600 years into the future but this just doesn't justify the 1000+ pages of boring one-dimensional characters doing boring things through a lot of boring side stories that do nothing to advance the main plot. The main story starts all right with a mysterious entity taking over the newly colonized planet Lalonde. However, when the take-over is revealed as souls of dead people taking over the bodies of the living it just goes too far and becomes religious and uninteresting.I won't buy the other books in the series for sure. I was very happy when the last page in this one was turned and I could start forgetting it as just another childish SF book (just a bit more boring than the rest).I won't recommend it unless you're a religious person but then the sex might be too much for you :-)"
1,Don't waste your money,"Ordinarily I would recommend Hamilton wholeheartedly. Not this time. Labyrinthine character building and world development over hundreds of pages is ruined in the end by a pure Deus ex Machina denouement. What a total waste of a good story. Even first year writers should know to steer clear of such a terrible plot device and for one of Hamilton's stature to use it in such a transparent fashion is disgusting. Seriously, don't waste your money."
2,A Big Disappontment,"No matter how I tried I could not get into this book. I got to page 198 then put it into the recycle bin.The book goes on and on jumping from one character to another to another...more jumbled then anything. And all this introduction is incredibly boring since nothing exciting happens. Even the space battles are very drab.The conversations between characters are very cheesey, and wore on me quite quickly. I felt as though I was reading a book for a young teen."
5,brilliant,"Hamilton is obviously a genius, which is the only thing that makes the book hard to read. The sex in the book, although juvenile, is sleazy and entertaining and adds a different sort of flavor to the book. The ideas in this book are not only brilliant, but also pioneering and revolutionary. This book is, quite possibly, the best book I've ever read. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!!"
3,A space opera with sentient ships,"The characters were two-dimensional and the future culture unbelievable. The plot was interesting enough to keep me going, however. It had a nebulous ending, which was presumably necessary to justify sequels (this one is labeled ""Part 1: Emergence""), though I will not buy the sequels."
2,Disappointing,"As a lover of SciFi in general and epic inter-planetary novels in particular, I really expected to like this book (especially after reading the glowing reviews here on Amazon). Instead, I found the plot to be disorienting and confusing, the characters to be flat, and the writing to be dull. Not sure what the other reviewers on this site were thinking (maybe they think people like them more when they write gushy reviews?), but I got so bored after halfway through the book that I stopped - which I almost never do. So maybe it gets really good in the second half ... but I doubt it. Overall, very disappointing."
2,Not a strong beginning,"I just finished the first half-book of this series and am not sure I will read any further. The book has some pluses, including an interesting and in some ways original view of what the future might look like. My biggest complaint is that I can't find much to like in any of the myriad characters that are introduced and frequently dissappear at the drop of a hat. In fact I might summarize my view of this book as ""many characters are introduced, most are killed off quickly, and I wish the others had been too."" There's lots of unnecessary sex, which doesn't in and of itself bother me, but I would say that the sexual exploits of the two main characters made them much less sympathetic. My only real hope for the series would be that Calvert goes through a fundamental character transformation-but my hopes aren't high-I kind of think that Hamilton likes Calvert the way he is."
2,Far from the best SF written.,"This book isn't in any way the best books written. It has some good parts and some bad parts, and the good parts makes it acceptable to read. You can often skip a some hundred pages forward now and then and still keep the story in line. (too many words for nothing else but a party of red clouds and slaughter.) The following book ""The neutronium alchemist"" is a little better, and I'm waiting for the third book. (I did read the complete ""The reality dysfunction"" in one book), My opinion is that the same story could have been told in half the number of pages without any loss to the story."
1,Kindle edition is horribly edited,"This review is particular to the Kindle edition of The Reality Dysfunction(Part I) and has nothing to do with the story itself.The Kindle edition of this title should not be purchased, by anyone. Ever.Why? The sheer number of translation/editing mistakes is staggering. In some sections, four out of fifteen words are spelled incorrectly. I'm not talking about simple positional errors like ""teh"", I'm talking about the word ""them"" being spelled ""him"" or ""aon"". At times, I've actually had to step out of the story and spend a minute or more puzzling out what the actual word was supposed to be.I've purchased many Kindle edition titles and while there are often a few mistakes here or there, this title is almost unreadable."
2,Uneven,"This book is a strange case. Its the first one in years where I skip entire chapters and still continue reading.The world the author describes is often very cool, and even kind of believable. But his plots tend to take too long with nothing much happening in many parts of the story.Characters are another thing: some are very fascinating, like the satanist guy in the first volume. But then he gets taken over by these evil spirits, and you simply stop caring about him. He's become a boring plot puppet.I'll agree with another critic here on amazon: these would have needed some serious editing, even if that reduced the series by 20-40%. As it is, I hope the parts that fascinate me stay numerous enough to keep me going, for I hate to leave a series unfinished."
3,Trying So So Hard,"For starters, I am 90%(according to my Kindle) through this book. This series was highly recommended to me by a fellow Sci-Fi fan and so I had high expectations. It takes stamina. Lots of stamina. It's not all bad, in fact there is a lot to love.My biggest problem is the what seems to be seemingly endless (both in volume and length) descriptions of people and places that have very minor significance to the plot. Some times it seems like the author spends more time introducing characters and then letting them die almost immediately after the introduction. It means that unless you scan the book the plot unfolds at a very slow rate.On the plus side when the plot and action gets going it's amazing, the main characters are especially interesting.I really want to love this, but it is just such hard work."
1,Worst Book Ever,"Pulp, poorly written, poorly researched. It's a rare event I find a science fiction book I don't like, and this one tops a short list. The most irritating thing is the comparisons to the Dune and Foundation series on the book jacket. I'm surprised more than one book in the series was published. Perhaps the later books get better, it is unlikely I will find out."
2,Gimme a Break,"This series is more horror than science fiction. The basic concept is that the dead are coming back to possess the living. A bit over the top, in my humble opinion. And when Al Capone comes back . . . gimme a break.It's also way too long. I'm about to give up about a third of the way into the third book. I'm sick of all the gratuitous violence. Just freaking save the universe already and be done with it."
1,"As much as Pandora's Star was good, this is bad","I was not expecting a sci-fi story about satanists so that was already an unhappy suprise as that developed. So many separate stories, it was hard to keep track of who was who and nobody seemed that real. Whenever a problem did happen, people ran a program in their head... Oh, i'm hurt, theres an app in my head for that... Oh, i need an encyclopedia to look something up, there's a software app for that in my head, that girl is really sexy, there's software in my head to help me deal with that too. I just could not relate with any of these characters, even though I went through a little than half the book."
3,Slow start to an outstanding series,"On the strength of Fallen Dragon, I picked up this book and its second half and began reading. Though I was interested in the plot, I found it hard to care about the many, many characters introduced. Fortunately, the second and later books of the series managed to make me care about and become invested in, the lives and actions of the characters. Worth reading, if only as a prelude to The Neutronium Alchemist and The Naked God."
1,"It's pretty much all been said, but...","I bought this book, and ended up doing something very, very rare. I didn't finish it. I didn't sell it. I, who am positively reverent about the printed word, threw it away.The reviewer who mentioned the dog's fate has it right. This book turned my stomach so badly that I couldn't go on. And I read everything.This book is dreadful. God awful. It makes me sick to think that someone, somewhere, is going to compare this book to Susan Matthew's books, and thereby send some poor soul, completely revolted by this trash, away from some seriously good books.Please, if you haven't attempted this book, or any of this person's others, don't. I started out bored and slightly revulsed. I finished so revolted and sickened that I cannot even contemplate buying anything else by this author.Enough said, and probably more than anyone wants to hear."
5,THE ULTIMATE SPACE-OPERA,What a marvel! 1240 fast paced pages (Volume I and II) sucking you into the void within.This book is second only to Dan Simmon's Hyperion-trilogy and can be compared with good German bread.
2,"promising ideas, too long and little payoff","I liked the first part of this book, and part 2. It's too long, though. I'd say this book could be one third the size and be 10x more enjoyable. There are just too many very, very long descriptions of situations, people, places and items which are just plain boring. I found myself skipping over these long interludes.Also, I was disappointed in the end. Not because it didn't wrap everything up in a tidy little bundle, but because the thread he chose to resolve was the least interesting, in my opinion. There were lots of other threads that were completely unexplored. Perhaps the rest of them will be tied up or discussed more in future novels? I won't be reading them."
2,Only half a novel,"It's been pointed out by other reviewers, but this is a VERY frustrating book. Or rather, half a book. I'm a big fan of space opera series, and I don't mind loose threads left hanging, but this book leaves ALL threads hanging. There is not a single plot element wrapped up, not a single character development phase completed. New characters are introduced in the last 50 pages for no apparent reason (no doubt they'll appear in the other books).All of this would be less frustrating if this book were good enough to make me want to read the rest of the series. It's not. The writing style is competent, but about as subtle as a sledgehammer. The characters are all tell and no show. The female characters are especially badly drawn. (Note to all sci-fi writers -- Heinlein was *terrible* at writing women. Please stop trying to imitate him.)"
4,Detailed and vibrant,"I remember when I read the first several pages of the first book- it pulled me in very quickly. The characters are believable, the ships are marvelous wonders, the science is simply cool and the plot continues to keep my attention. In short, I can't wait for the final two books and I know that one day I'll be reading all 3,500+ pages again- what a ride!"
3,A true pleasure to read such an out-standing epic.,A totally enjoyable epic adventure that I couldn't put down. Reading all the books of this epic struggle between life and souls locked in an unbearable after life was a truly engrossing adventure. I very much enjoyed the series and await Peter's next book. Definitly a series of books I will read again and keep in my library.
3,gonzo travel writing,"I enjoyed the volumes before and after this one immensely, and only bought this one with reluctance. I was correct in my misgivings.While many of the pieces are quite good, I did find a monotonous repetition in the style of the pieces. Hearty adventurer finds some remote location, undertakes a manly man's activity (even when a woman) and reports on it with an affected sarcasm or wryness or ennui style. Ho-hum. Doesn't Theroux write entire books like this? Maybe I've just read too much of his works to like the derivatives.Thankfully, I skipped those pieces to read the good ones (even good ones that fit the above mode -- like Philip Capute's piece about looking for lions while on safari). Those jewels made me glad to buy this volume, even though I skipped the bulk of the pieces.Of course, if you LIKE gonzo-style travel writing, then this is the volume for you. Buy it and enjoy."
5,Excellent introductory new age primer,"This book does an excellent job at providing an introductory overview of a large number of ""new age"" topics in an easy-to-read style. Reincarnation, crystals, chakras, channeling, meditation, auras, lost civilazations and the evolution of religion are covered clearly and simply. The authors (Bartlett and Whiteheart) have many years of experience in the subjects they discuss, and their passion and enthusiasm shines through!"
2,They bind your ankles after 8 hours,"This seemed like a great sock so I spent about 30 bucks for 8 pair. I do a ton of walking so a comfortable sock is of paramount importance to me. After regular use and repeated proper washing these socks bind your ankle. This is due to a design defect. Apparently the manufacturer folds over about 1.5 inches of the top of the sock inside the sock and then adds a stitch line. This stitch line is a source of irritation after a few hours of wearing. I called the company and basically they said tough, that's the way we make them and others haven't complained. I pointed out that 99.9% of the buyers probably just discard the sock packaging and don't remember who to contact. Anyway their customer service sux too. DON'T BUY THESE. You can do better."
4,The Gloria Record,"Having been absolutly in love with mineral for over a year, and finding out that the band was no longer in existance, i was ecstatic to find a band almost exactly the same as Mineral.(mineral being five star, the Gloria Record is up and running close with four.) upon recieving the cd, i have hardly gone a day without listening to it. There's about seven tracks on it two or three of which are instrumental. very beautiful and melodic emo. I am a fan of music, I listen to all sorts but am very particular about what it is that i think is ""good."" this is definitely an all time favorite. very inspired band."
4,Mineral has gone softer in style,"This is a solid album, but the songs tend to sound alike. Although TGR is a good band, they're not as good as Mineral was, and as good as their inspiration, Sunny Day Real Estate is."
1,Not a practical guide,"Unless you plan to have an agricultural based farm, using draft horses, DON'T Bother With This Book. It is an interesting read on horse powered farming, no practical advise, no ""setting up"" or design of a farm included. Why this title, I haven't a clue. I've never submitted a review to Amazon before, but I felt that the title of the book was so misleading that it was important to do so."
4,A great book but not for beginners,"This book has probably kept more people from making a bamboo rod than any other work. It is a great book, just don't buy it thinking that it will teach you how to make one. It is not an instruction manual, but rather documentation of how Garrison made his rods. No question that Garrison set the standard for many aspects of rodmaking, but this is the book t0 read AFTER you read Maurer and Elser, or Cattanach, or The Lovely Reed."
3,They are ok,"I just purchased these shoes needing a replacement for the Bostonians that I have been wearing for more than a year now. I am on a budget and didn't want to shell out too much money for a pair of shoes. They look a lot better in the picture than in person. They look cheap compared to the shoes I am used to wearing. They fit well but don't allow much breathing and my foot got really overheated. I do like their comfortable sole and the rubber has much better traction and less noise than the leather soles I am used to. I have only worn them once so I can not attest to durability, but I would doubt that these last more than a few months and I am curious as to how well these will respond to shoe polish.Update 12-14-10. OK. I am sorry. These shoes are better than I thought. They still look kind of cheap, but have held up really well for 8 months now. They are super comfy too. I think owe Stacy Adams an apology. These shoes are a bargain. They can pass for dress shoes alright."
4,A sign of the times,"It was a difficult read as the writer's style was typical of the times of the subject. Lots of inside facts about Janis, her talent and her sadness. Not sorry I purchased the book, but you have to be able to pay attention to follow the author's writing style. I recommend the book."
1,Home Made video,"This video was pretty weak on everything, they shot the video in there living room and in there bedroom. The guy actually teaches you sitting on his bed. Not a good teacher, waste of money."
2,Ok for beginners,"This video is a great introduction for novice musicians to gain a better insight into the creation of, and techniques used to play the Udu. Unfortunately the video does not provide the type of information that an advanced player could utilize. Overall good introduction to the art of Udu if you are a beginner."
4,"They did it slower, but better","Vintage book on organizing and being the best manager you can be. Includes chapters on planning, organizing, directing, and controlling. Learn what it was like to be the man in the grey flannel suit. Hardback, 484 pp. You can't lose."
1,Total waist of money,"This book is a farce. All it does is give you an overview of DirectShow without explaining the mechanisms inside or how to approach issues that are less common. All this book does is pack whatever is written in MSDN into a nice hardcopy. There is no added value what so ever. Its fine for beginners who want to learn how to work with graph edit and do basic things with it. But why bother to buy this book if you can read everything in MSDN. I think the writer did a very systematic work of just reading Microsoft?s material in MSDN and rewriting it. Even the sample code is the same as in MSDN. I expected to learn more from a book like this then what they show you in MSDN samples. These usually are very basic, and one can expect from a book to add more value to it. There are entire topics that are not covered. I believe it?s a total waist of time and money."
3,Too much cut and paste from the MSDN.,"Too much cut and paste from the MSDN, I could have done that.However, it does give you a place to start."
5,great for multimedia,This book is one of a kind. I really liked the chapters on audio/video capture and compression. The chapter talks about creating video camera applications with sound. I recommend this book
1,Plagiarized version of MSDN,"I agree with many other readers. This book merely lists all the interfaces and functions and a brief description of what they do. All the sample code is straight from the Directx SDK...Someone correctly said that this is just the MSDN with an index and on paperback.We really need a ""good"" book on DirectX programming. Especially concepts like Audio capturing in conjunction with WDM architecture etc..."
2,"Just as good as the MS Docs, which isn't saying much.","This book is rather obviously just a rewrite of the MS documentation, which (in general) is not a compliment. The example code in the book is probably it's only saving grace, but even then it is only sparsely commented. The comments generally only describe what is happening, and not why.While downloading the code from the internet is a valid way to distribute the sample code, it's just one more step I have to do, and a companion CD would have been a good bonus.In general, I'd say save your money and use the MSDN docs."
2,If only there was another....,"Well, after searching far and wide I found that this is the only book on DirectShow. Sad. This is a very complex topic, and deserves just as many books as MPEG4 or other media type specific books. I am sorry to say that nearly all (90%) of this information is from MSDN. The 10% that is not is useful, but you can learn the same amount by going through the sample code for two weeks (if not more). The only part that is useful and not on MSDN is the RenderFilter in chapter 14. The source for this however is NOT on the books website, so you have to type in the 7 pages of code.So, if you are going to buy this book realize you are getting MSDN on paperback with an Index. Go through the Sample apps on the DXSDK and you get the same experience / knowledge."
3,"Ok book, but then not too many others to judge it by...","I bought this book since I had to write a DirectShow application in C++ and didn't know a thing about DirectShow. The book did help me get a footing and I was able to write the program. The book is not as detailed as I would have liked, but it is better then nothing. I would recommend you also have a COM book beside you as well."
2,blah book,"irrelevant ramblings about non-exam topics, boring writing style, poor questions, bad code examples, and an obvious anti-microsoft attitude makes this a book that one should probably pass on."
1,how do i get a refund?,"The sample questions are too easy.the book seems to go on tangents at a whim.the book hates microsft and anything that ms has done, the author can do beeter.after reading this book i took the test. failed! remembered about 10 question on the test. couldn't find the answers in this book. i am extremely upset at this book.don't waste any of your time with this book. the people that like this book must not be beginners and love to hate microsoft. it also does not cover what you need to know to pass."
4,Lots of dry info but more fun reading than the MS stuff,"Thanks to the author for sharing his insight with us, which is obviously the result of hands on experience with many generations of machines and softwareproducts. Even though some parts are a lot more like a reference to the various aspects of the WOSA, the immediate assessment-questions and the practical labs added to each chapter make it a great study guide."
1,"A poor reference, and the author wanders off subject.","I've decided a couple of days ago that I'm going to write a book, I am going to copy all the interfaces out of some SDK, write some horrible code, and throw in a little Microsoft bashing. All that I would have to do is relearn COBOL and start lecturing on the benefits of compiled binary masses, but I realized that it's been done, and this is the book that did it. Classic"
2,"Good volume, little substance",Good volume but very little substance. The author's description are too esoteric and laced with lots of errors. The editorial team did very little in terms of proofreading and correcting typos.
1,"A horribly written, rambling, self-serving tome...","I bought this book with high expectations. Instead, I found a book that uses terms and jargon without defining them first, and rambles around a subject with no clear buildup from general to specific explanation. This reminds me of the computer books that first came on the market back in the early eighties. Much of the writing seemed aimed at impressing me with the author's vast knowledge and experience, but I wasn't impressed at all. Instead, I was so disappointed that I went through the trouble of returning the book and getting a refund. Shame on the publisher for a terrible lapse in their editorial duties --- this book should have never made it to print. Heck, even the Microsoft training guide for Windows Architecture puts this book to shame..."
3,Good book with a few nagging problems.,"I'll cut right to the chase,Good points:1. Great index. It makes it much easier to research things.2. Almost all of the topics needed for the exams.3. Mostly great coverage of material discussed. The author knows how to present the material well.Bad points:1. The author also knows how to really dog on Microsoft. This is totally unnecessary and gets incredibly old. Please...stop the whining already. Can't we all just get along?2. The book's study questions are nothing like the actual exam questions. They are much too easy. You're going to need Transcender in addition to this book.3. A heafty portion of this study guide covers information that isn't even part of what the exams cover. 400-500 pages are pretty much unnecessary to read.Summary: If you don't mind reading extra material, can handle the Microsoft bashing, and are planning to supplement your studies with Transcender, you will find this a great book.- Lawryll..."
2,Mislabeled as a study guide,Don't be fooled...this is NOT an exam study guide. This is a reference guide. If you try and prepare with this book you are going to find out it contains entire sections on material that isn't going to be covered on the test. While most of the information IS in here...it's a cryptic struggle to try and prepare for the exam. You'll spend twice as much time studying for the exam as you need to. It is completely mislabeled as an exam study guide.If this were labeled as a reference guide I would have given it 4 stars.
1,Poor study guide,"This book while extremely large and a good reference book with a large index, is not for someone who wants to learn Win Arch quickly to pass the exam. I disagree with the title of ""study guide"". It was not good a supplement for a MCT lead class. While attempting to read the first chapter I fell asleep twice while reading about how the author coded in the ""old days"". It also seemed the author was trying to impress me with his large vocabulary and as a result I found it difficult to understand completely what he was talking about sometimes. I found a better set of books (one book for each exam) which were easy to read and chuck full of info for the same price. Using the other two I passed the exams on the first try. I would not recommend this book if you are studying for the exam."
1,"I tried to use this book, I really tried...","But I couldn't get past the:a. Massive amounts of off-exam subject material.b. The constant jabs at Microsoft. What's up with that anyway? It's makes the author look very whiney and childish.c. Poor examples of code.d. The poor editing. The books rambles to and fro.I read about 200 pages. I give up. Even MSDN looks like a better way to study than this.Maybe I'll check out the MUCH revised second edition, as I like the concept of a single book for both exams, but this isn't going to cut it...especially for an MCSD exam guide."
2,Maybe you should check out other titles...,"Ifyou can rummage through this book, you will find that most of the material on the exam in in here, oh but what a pain it is to find. What a disorganized mess this book is. To top it all off, Burce has been kind enough to include 500 pages of totally irrelevant material. That's just what I'm looking for when I'm studying for a hard test. Lot's of irrelevant exam material to sift through.Which leaves me wondering why this book claims to be a MICROSOFT MCSD study guide?TTFN - Tom"

Lot's of irrelevant exam material to sift through.Which leaves me wondering why this book claims to be a MICROSOFT MCSD study guide?TTFN - Tom"
2,Some good information--amid opinion and bashing,"This book has a lot of good information in it, but it is mixed in with a lot of opinion and bashing of Microsoft. There are tens, if not hundreds, of typos and errors in the book with so much wandering off of the subject that it gives me the feeling that neither the publisher nor Bruce reviewed the material to check for accuracy or relevancy. The best thing about this book was the accompanying CD with Appendix F. It is a good summary and covers most of the material in the book in just 78 pages. Nearly a third of the text in the book is a waste of space and was a waste of my time."
3,I'd rather just use the developers network CD,"Full of fluff and unfocused on the primary subject matter (the MCSD exams). It does, however, contain some good information on many subjects IF one uses the CD-ROM appendix and IF one can wade through the non-MCSD material. I'm not sure I care very much for the lack of repect the author has toward Microsoft no matter how crummy some of their methods actually are. A study guide for the two MCSD exams is NOT the place to be discussing those issues and in some of the code examples from the book I noticed the author himself wasn't exactly the brilliant genius he thinks he is. All in all, about 90% of the material you need to know for the exam is in here...somewhere...surrounded by an equal amount of material you do not need to know."
2,too much off-topic diversion,"too many disorganzied sections and unrelated to exams.Not a exam-guide oriented book. ButI think it did a good job in COM and Interface design topics. I don't think it is a useful book as a reference for the exam. I would recommend Architecture I & II BY Sybex publishing plus Transcender and MSDN library.Without extensive reading, it's much more difficult to pass Window Arch I & II. I passed the two coreexams within one and a half month by doing this."
4,"Decent book, BUT NO LONGER RELEVANT!","Anyone considering purchasing this book should know that Microsoft is completely revamping the MCSD program effective 1/1/99. There will still be a limited period of time during which the Win Arch exams will be ""live,"" but they will almost certainly be eliminated at some point in 1999. If you must get the MCSD _now_, then consider this book. If you can wait several months, you probably should; the MCSD you receive based on the new track will have a longer shelf life than the MCSD that Win Arch can give you."
1,Discontinued Exams,I was on Microsoft's Web site recently and they advised that the MCSD program was being revised. According to them the exams that this volume is supposed to cover will be discontinued. It would be in the best interests of the author and publisher to review Microsoft's new exam requirements and revise this volume accordingly.
2,Terrible book,"Although I'm not yet done reading the book, it seems terrible to me. I'm not really sure how much of what is presented in the book (and in which detail) is required for the exams, but I do know that as one who has some COM background, I am having a hard time following the author. As was said in other reviews - the material is visually presented in a very poor way."
5,One of the Best books I have seen Please read on!,"Hi, Everybody cool it. I come from an embedded programming background with high performance real time systems also UNIX etc. not to mention IBM 360/370 as well as real time development for NT/9x etc. I started professional programming since 1986 when I was in High school. So, I do know what goes into it. Let me quote something which happened at M$ forum (MFC) in front of my eyes. If anyone doubts it, take a look at the M$ site for its archive. NT4SP4 changes the systems so much that your previous programs fail. There were M$ developers yelling there when this happened. This is the kind of critical thinking which Bruce tries to put into this great book. I can only wish every budding developer studies this book. This book shows the problems, which you are gonna face when you develop, which happen with us all of the time."

3,The font made the difference!,"My book discussion group chose this Dickens holiday themed novella for our December meeting. the version from the library was printed in very small type. Kindle to the rescue!The book itself returns to many of the themes of the iconic A Christmas Carol. Devotees of Dickens who have not read it yet will probably enjoy it. For general readers, there is not much new here."
5,Perfect Dog Bed,Hypoallergenic and highly resistant to odor that plagues synthetic dog beds. We like it.
3,Way too long.,"Overall, this book helps you understand what the struggle really has been in Afghanistan. You have a much clearer understanding of why we helped Osama Bin Laden in the first place. We were fighting the cold war against Russia and Russia had taken over the country. If the author could have condensed the book a little. It was just a bit much to wade through and the story line was too complex for the writing."
1,Good show; bad release,"This DVD contains only four 23-minute episodes, which, as far as I'm concerned, means it's not worth the money. If you buy these DVDs individually, rather than wait for the release of the full season, you'll end up paying nearly double the overall cost. What the studio is doing, as they've done with their other animated shows, is unconscionable and unjustifiable, and I strongly recommend that you not give them your money until they release the full season.If I were to rate the content rather than the studio greed, I would give this release four stars. The team is starting to gel and it feels as though the writers are getting a bit more comfortable with the characters, the personalities, and the interactions. There is still a bit of clumsiness here and there, and Kid Flash is still a bit too unlikeable for my taste, but you can definitely see some possibilities.If you want to view the content now rather than wait, do what I did and rent it or stream it."
3,"Great Show, Terrible DVD Release System","I love this show and my five-year old son loves this show. It's a great take on some of the younger members of the DC Comics universe. However, I really wish the producers released the entire first season at once. Instead they released three separate DVD's with several episodes each. Ugh. What a waste of time and money. Hopefully they get it right for season two, this great show deserves better."
4,Young Justice,"I really like this series, and I enjoy watching it to see how they will mature and become the future Justice League. I give it 4 out of 5 because is not on blu-ray."
5,I recomend!,It's a very good Calculus text book. Good to learn and teach! It's a classical text. I recomend to buy!
2,Mediocre At Best,"Another reviewer said that it is lamentable that MIT is no longer using this book. I'm an MIT student that had to use this book and am very happy that MIT had enough sense to change texts. The explanations were poor and it was almost devoid of decent pictures (visualizing is VERY important in calculus). Also, the examples were next to useless. I wound up using my high school AP Calculus book by Thomas/Finney (I think this is the book MIT uses now) rather than this text. There are a number of excellent Calculus books published, but this isn't one of them. Anybody who says this is the best calculus book hasn't reviewed many books."
1,Not Helpful in the Least,"Another MIT student here... unfortunately not all calc. classes at MIT has stopped using this book. As a result the majority of our class is hopelessly lost... and this is at MIT!!!... now that's a testament to how bad the book is... Things aren't explained well, the examples have nothing to do with the actual problems, and without the ""space wasting"" graphics that so many other books have it's difficult to visualize what Simmons is talking about, and despite popular opinion visualizing what you are doing is very important to calculus. I'm relying on my HS calc book to get me through the course."
3,"Good material, but too ""boring"" to read.","I used this book on my first Calculus Course. The material is well explained, however the lack of objectivity from the author makes the reading boring."
5,Good buy for the price.,I ordered this book for my son. It was delivered quickly and the book is in very good condition for being used. Received a better price than at the school book store. Very pleased with the purchase.
5,Feels So Good,"The album cover sais it all. This is feel good, sometimes whimsical but always jazz music. I put this on my kindle so I'll always have it handy."
4,A nice classic,"Caught the title song on the radio recently and knew I had to get the album for my MP3 player. I had the album once upon a time, in vinyl, and never got a CD. Very glad that I've got this collection back in my musical lineup."
3,Not the complete album,"While it is very similar to the original album, it is missing the performances with Esther Staterfield (e.g. Lulabye for Nancy Carol). Disappointing."
1,"Misleading ad. Album content not adequate with album cover, a rip-off.","Not the right version that goes with the album cover, another rip off. Send the original version that goes with this album cover, or get me a refund."
5,IN-CRE-DI-BLE,"I know a single piece doesn't make worth a whole album, but trust me- Feels So Good is *incredible*. Not only the melody and chord progression are simply amazing, and a real pleasure for the ears, but this song's solos are without a doubt among the best I've ever heard, each in their category. I've been hearing time after time the electric guitar solo for years, and now I know the man's name: Grant Grassman. Same with the sax: Chris Vadala. These two solos should be sold separately, as they're two of the most inspired funk-jazz solos you'll be able to listen to ever.What I mean with all this text is that not only you're buying a great work from Mangione, but also a chance to listen to the wonderful musicians he's surrounded by.Sweet, melodic, completely inspiring, funky, jazzy, groovy collection. Buy this one, and if you don't like it, sell your copy to me."
5,Chuck is the man,"Whenever I'm feeling blue, old Chuck takes me through. I am whisked away on a magic ride above the clouds, carried by the sound of Chuck's beautiful music..."
1,Not what I expected,I loved the idea of the necklace but the pewter blackened my neck. It wasvery costume jewelry looking. I would check for allergies to pewter before you buy this for you or anyone. I was hoping for more.
1,I was drunk,"I was drunk when I bought this.I regret buying it. Time to move on in the video game world to DJ Hero and things of this sort-Or better yet, go to the karaoke bar in the Asian town near you!"
3,Vinyl Boat Fender,"Nice product. I bought two of these as a Father's Day gift for my fiance.They are smaller than I expected, but nothing to complain about."
4,Great,My girls love it! It gets read quite a bit at our house. Board books make for easy page turning for little fingers.
4,A good book.,"This is a good, fun book, but it is far from my favorite Boynton book. Still a nice book to have, especially on a birthday!"
5,Another Boynton hit!,Another Boynton fun book. A great 'read to me' book and also good for early readers. I left it on my grandson's night stand so he would have it when he woke up on his 5th birthday. The story has 5 birthday monsters so it was perfect.
2,Not our favorite,"We are huge Boynton fans. My son received this and ""Happy Birthday Little Pookie!"" for his third birthday. He much prefers ""Happy Birthday Little Pookie"" as do I. ""Monsters"" is not as sweet and he has become concerned about whether the Monsters will come to our house."
5,Birthday Monsters,My son loves all of Sandra Boynton books...it is a great Birthday book for a boy or a girl!!! I always keep a copy on hand for birthday parties that are short notice!!!
3,Nothing special,"If you like Boynton's books, you'll probably like this one too. My son is more of a fan of her ""Opposites"" or ""But Not the Hippopotamus"". It's OK, as far as children's books go, but Boynton has done better."
4,A must take along for a trip to Banff,"A must take along for a trip to Banff or the Canadian Rockies. The book explains where these magnificent mountains came from, in an easily readable way."
3,Good videos,"My review is about the review done by James A. Reynolds III. All of his reviews are worthless. He never gives insight about the game, movie, book, etc. He just spews the same Taliban-like crap from right-wing conservative morons. Leave your political views out of the reviews. If you want to continue to make these stupid remarks, go to Foxnews.com. Fox news - they lie & you comply."
2,Does not stick to the original story by D. Lapierre,It is a good movie but has very little to do with the original novel by Dominique Lapierre. This story is definitely a lesson in hope and faith. The movie fails so accomplish that. I just didn't like it. I recommend the book instead.
1,Total abomination.,"If you are not illiterate, please, please, please read the book instead, it is great. This is one of the most ludicrous and offensive films ever made. From the moronic main character (atrociously played by Patrick Swayze) to the condescending portraits of Indians to the trivialization of Calcutta's suffering to the utter, incomprehensible cop-out of an finale, this mush will depress and sicken you.There should be a special fine imposed on companies and individuals who turn human suffering and adversity into a vapid Hollywood joke. It was nice to catch (briefly) a few glimpses of Calcutta again, but the film makers seem to have missed the whole point of the book, and exploited its subject matter for cheap, predictable box-office slop. India's poor need respect and empowerment, not a grimace and a pat on the head. Please spend your money on the book, because a percentage of the proceeds will go to benefit the real Citizens of Joy."
3,City Of Joy,Swayze didn't do bad movies. Not his best though. Would still recommend for anyone who likes him as an actor.
5,Swayze Shines,This proves the versatility of Patrick Swayze. This is set in India and he plays the role well and with believability. This is a well balanced film and everyone will find something they like.
3,city of joy,"If you have not read the book, the movie is ok.But I have read the book, one of the most touching ever written in my opinion.Also, I am Europeen and think, that the movie has been watered down beyond recognition to please mainstream Amerikans...My sugestion: read the book!"
4,Real India,"Most movies, even the ones from Bollywood gloss over the reality of the poverty, dirtiness etc. This movie is true to the life and culture of the people. The characters are well fleshed out; they seem real and you care about them. Unless you've been to India you might not believe that people can be so poor and not be miserable. This movie shows how everyone can find joy in life, where they are, with what they have. Excellent movie."
4,CIty of Joy,"I first saw this film nearly fifteen years ago and it really made an impact then. Having time change my experiences and having found myself involved in yoga and eastern philosophy, I now see that this film hits home on many levels. From making you appreciate what you have, to understanding the value of service to others, from the human spirit and to faith in the universe and personal growth. This film has it all.I'll take it out and watch it again, every time I get caught up in worrying about what I don't have and the illusion we get caught up in, in our materialistic world. Check it out !!"
3,City of Joy,"I really enjoyed the movie but the book has so much more to offer!!""City of Joy"" the book gets 5 stars!!!Anne Brunet"
4,"Okay, but not a classic.","This film is good if you want a moving story. It is not, however, a good movie to show to people who have no idea what Indian life is like. Overall, the acting isn't too bad and there are some good morals."
4,Good movie,"I was torn watching this movie. Liked it, didn't like it. Hard to watch many of the parts in it. Very honest portrayal of the poverty and sad living conditions in India. Patrick Swayze's character has a hard time coming to terms wiht an incident that took a child's life during his care as Patrick's patient. Moves to India to find some peace with himself. Very heart-rending story. Loved Patrick in this."
4,"Easy to install, fill, use","Works as expected, no glitches. It looks sharp, and is so nice not to have bottles all over the shower ledges. Am only rating 4 instead of 5 as I'm wondering what longevity will be - my only concern is that the finish will eventually rub off and am hoping this will be a reasonable mount of time down the road."
2,Would not buy again,"One of the pumps stopped working after only a month or two, My original dispenser lasted three years before the pump quit working."
5,soap dispenser,"Great product,no problem with instalation and the pumps work great.Priming the pumps was no problem at all.Again great product!Would highly reccomend!"
1,Not what I expected.,"I have always been a fan of Dispenser IV for the shower. I expected the same with this one. Here is the problem....The chambers are not separate. I would not recommend to anyone, if they like changing out shampoo/conditioner/or shower gel without taking all out. Can't rinse out one chamber without doing them all at one time."
5,Works as advertised.,"This product works exactly as it is advertised. Over the years, I have purchased this item five different times and the quality has been up to par each time. Currently, I have two of these in my shower (one for me and one for my significant other). This item significantly cuts down on the clutter and looks nice at the same time. It can be mounted on a flat wall or in the corner, which is very convenient. It comes with everything you need to mount it in your shower (a silicon glue and four double sided tape pieces). The ""chrome"" is actually plastic but it still looks very nice and holds up over time."
3,Decent but had to spend extra $,"I ordered this to save space in my shower. It came on time, looked just like the picture, nothing was missing. I went to install it, cleaned the shower, let it dry, started to assemble it...the silicone glue gel wouldn't come out of the tube. I worked with the tube, squeezed it over and over to see if I could somehow loosen it. No luck. I cut it open to make sure it was the gel and not just the tube's hole was too small. The silicone glue had turned into a taffy like stiffness and was no longer sticky. So now I have to go buy adhesive glue. I still like the dispenser, just would've preferred to not have to spend even more $ to install it."
3,be careful,"I ordered two of these. One works great, no problems, easy to install. The other drips from the middle chamber, whatever I put in it leaks out within an hour. I'm returning it to amazon for an exchange right now.I'd suggest that if you order these, be smarter than I was, Before you stick it to your wall, fill all three chambers with water, eject some water out and watch it and make sure it doesn't drip from any chamber. Do this BEFORE you fill it with any bath products and BEFORE you stick it to your wall - otherwise you lose a lot of bath product and have to figure out how to remove silicone glue from your shower walls. I just hope that amazon will send me a new one."
2,"Great idea, but needs work","We have two of these bath product dispensers and both have trouble dispensing conditioner. We primed it, according to directions, but conditioners that are thick don't work for long. In order to get enough conditioner to use, one has to push the pump about 40 times. We've emptied the chambers, soaked them for a while, cleaned out the holes that the conditioner comes through, but it still does not work properly. The other products (thinner ones like shampoo and liquid shower soap) work fine. I would have returned the product, but it stopped working a while after I'd thrown out the receipt. I think that there is an area, still clogged with conditioner that is impossible to reach and clean.Edited 10/7/2007 - I followed the directions on the product's web site to clean the nozzles, but the one that held conditioner still does not work. I'll probably order a new nozzle and report back to see if that solved the problem."
4,Pretty good product,"This is the second piece I purchased, and the older one has been in use for more that an year with no isues what so ever.. keeps my bathroom more organized. Purchased this for my guest bathroom."
4,De-Clutter your shower!,What a beautiful way to organize and de-clutter your shower. No more messy bottles or bars of soap rattling around. I plan to get one for the guest bath.
3,Soap dispenser,This is an okay product. It is nice looking but not very durable feeling. A little disappointed for the price.
5,Our customers are raving about the AVIVA Trio Dispenser,"I own a marina/hotel and recently purchased 5 AVIVA dispensers for all the showers. Our cusotmers LOVE it, and our housekeeping crew loves it too. Less to clean. I'll be purchasing many more once our next phase of construction is complete."
2,great idea and concept - poor execution,So we've had to replace all 3 dispenser pumps in under a month.Not sure I'd buy this...
2,Dispencer,"It wasn't the same as I had. Same number but they must have changed manufacturers because it mounted differently. I was able to get it to work, but it took some doing."
2,"Product is fine, BUT...","I followed all instructions and previous suggestions to test each of the buttons with colored water, everything was fine, no leaking. I primed the 3 buttons all the same. Product worked fine for 2 weeks, then one of the buttons started acting funny and I had to push it 15 times to get enough shampoo (far left button). I checked and nothing was clogging it up, so now I have to wait until I use up the conditioner and shower gel before I can take it down to empty the shampoo and see what's wrong. Frustrating."
5,Great item in the shower!,"I love these dispensers! Only thing I can complain about is that I thought this one was a flat against the wall dispenser. But I guess it doesn't matter since can be used in corner or on flat wall. They are so great, actually stay stuck to tile, and eliminates all those bottles in the shower. Mine is several years old and no problems yet. Love them!"
3,Soap/Shampoo Shower Dispenser,"We like storing our shower essentials in this type of holder. This one is nice looking and easy to put up on the shower wall. I remember reading some reviewers comment on leakage and unfortunately our soap section seems to leak somewhat. Otherwise the dispenser is nice. Attractive, easy to use, and the conditioner doesn't get stuck like our old one used to."
4,Beautiful in my shower...,"I loved my old dispenser. It lasted in my shower about two years before I ended up hearing that fateful crash in the middle of the night, which really isn't too bad. Because I had to move from a two bedroom house of my own to a tiny bedroom with a shared bath when I changed jobs I didn't bother reinstalling since the top was cracked and tossed it. I bought this one last week. Shipping was fantastic [WHOO AMAZON PRIME!], but the package came with a dried out tube of silicone. I suggest if you order this to save some time and order this as well:Dap 00688 Household Waterproof Adhesive Sealant, 100% Silicone, 2.8-Ounce Tube."
1,Collection suffers from Universal Defect. Stay Away!!!,"Extremely disappointed with this collection, Jimmy Neutron movie is incomplete, telling me i need disc 2 but i don't have another disc for the movie. A bit confusing since the disc stops about 40 minutes in then pops up with a screen saying Insert Disc 2. I tried other movie discs thinking maybe they added it on the other ones but no luck. Sent product back and currently waiting for refund. Looked on the net, found out this is a universal defect. Stay Away from this Package!"
3,Mediocre,"For those interested in buying this product to replace the OEM powercord for their Gateway 7405GX, I'd like to warn them that this power supply *will* work, however it will not work particularly well. The plug itself seems to be physically a bit large to fit into the socket on the back of the laptop, and so one must tediously wiggle it in, waiting for it to magically begin conducting power. Not a few times I've done this ritual, gotten power, left my laptop for a few hours on and plugged in, and returned only to find that it had unwiggled itself in my absence and the machine had drained itself of all energy."
1,Poorly made and not worth it.,"I purchased this charger about a month ago and by the time I received an email reminding me to review this product it was already not working. It worked well for about two weeks and then the cord had to be jiggled and held at a certain angle to get the charge until it finally gave out. The connector came apart and so I investigated. I cut the cord open and saw that it was poorly soldered together; the connection was barely there in the first place because the wires were just touching the connector. Since this is the second cord this has happened with I have decided not to buy another one. I pulled the wires out of the cord myself and spliced the connector back on, soldered it myself, and put electrical tape around it. It works now but only after a lot of hassle and effort on my part."
5,I still love it!,"I received this wonderful book as a gift when I was about three years old. Several years ago I found it in my parents' attic, well loved, well read, and tattered, but I brought it home with me and read it, countless times, to my grandchildren. My grandson, especially, loved it, and asked for it again and again. It is one of the best children's books ever, full of adventure yet gently teaching the values of friendship and kindness. I still love to read it just for myself."
5,Great Movie!,Ordered this for my brother's bday present. He loved this movie when he was little and loves it even more now! Great price!!
5,I love the power glove... it's so bad,"This is from beginning to end, a Nintendo ad. Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great movie, but it is what it is. This movie also debuted one of the best Nintendo games of all time, Super Mario Bros. 3. It was great; you get hopped up on candy and popcorn and coke and then get to watch a huge Nintendo movie AND get to see action shots of the newest Super Mario game. The movie, surprisingly, has a depth to it (despite all the Nintendo references).The movie is about a little boy who is emotionally scarred from an earlier event (you find out the event later in the movie). It's found out, though, that he's a wizard at video games. Through a series of events, they end up at a video game competition.Don't miss the best one-liner/Nintendo ad ever: ""I love the power glove, it's so bad!""Bottom line: It's a good movie and I would recommend it to any Nintendo fan or anyone who wants to remember what 80's movies are all about."
5,A very entertaining movie!!,"I really enjoyed ""The Wizard"". Savage and Edwards put on a good performance, along with Christan Slater. I enjoyed this movie!! I love it!!"
4,The Wizard gave a new coolness to playing video games.,"After seeing the Wizard, my friends and I all began keeping track of who was the best at which games, and who had the highest score. The Wizard, while on all merits a terrible movie, is a winner simply because it is the only movie ever to (semi) seriously deal with video games/arcades of the late 80s! I loved the super game dome place in the final competition. Oh, and I love when the badass kid opens up his box and says, ""I have all 99"", when in reality there are about 12 games in the box and the number of games in existence far exceeds 500. It was my favorite film as a kid."
3,What Ever Happened to the Grease Monkey?,"I saw this movie in the theater and I just thought it was a great kids movie! I loved the Grease Monkey scene, it's so classic! Amazon you should add his line to the quotes for this movie! Who could ever forget his line?: ""In your size, with your price, all I got is these retreads...which would be old whitewalls!"" I love Chuck Skinner what ever happened to that guy he could have been big! He should be a big star, he has what it takes! What happened to the GREASE MONKEY?"
5,More Than a Movie for Kids...,"Dealing heavily with video game content, the 1989 release ""The Wizard"" took a great cast and combined it with both terrific comedy and a heartfelt and well played out story. Fred Savage, who was on top of the world at the time, was obviously a great pick for the main character. Beau Bridges and Christian Slater took the movie to an even higher level of meaningfulness and laughter with their performances...The movie is full of great comedy that suits all ages, and a heart-warming story of a divided family trying to come together. I dont think there is an age group even 12 years later that this movie wont appeal to, which makes it a timeless classic for me and a great purchase idea for everyone...wherever you may find this rare film that is. Deffinately one of the best movies Ive ever seen."
4,"bad in most ways, VERY good in others!!!!!!!!!!","I guess I speak for every one when I say that the Wizard is a down right terrible, and sloppliey writen film. It is a a lot like a advertisment and is goofy to the extreme and many mistakes were made. However while most of that was terrible the Wizard is held together by a whole sceib load of humor (mostly for it's goofiness) and it's really enhanced when you've kicked back a few brews! Also it showcased the best videogames ever made which were made around that time and we were all very happy to play alot of those games as well as playing them today games like City Connection. Those two things with the saying (I Love The Glove)saying, basically make the movie pretty dope!! And fun to watch!"
3,A decent road trip video game film for the whole family,"The Wizard is basically Rain Man with Kids and video games. It's also basically just a 2 hour advertisement for Nintendo. It's still fairly entertaining though and not a bad film for the whole family. Fred Savage plays a kid who runs away with his mentally unstable brother. Instead of being good at gambling in Las Vegas though like Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, he's a video game genius. So they plan on heading to a video game tournerment. The big game to play is the new Mario Brothers game that was just coming out at that time. I think it was Mario Brothers 3.The film was hated by critics of course but it's pretty harmless. I remember thinking that two of the better performances in the movie came from Beau Bridges as the father and Christian Slater as the older brother who travel to find them and bond in the process. I'm not sure if it would entertain me now as much as it did as a kid but I don't see why kids of today wouldn't like it."
5,Great movie,Love this movie since I was a kid. It's still one of my favorites. Anyone loving video games this is a must own.
4,"Not the best movie, but for NES fans...","Granted, this is an objectionable film, but since the old NES was getting extremely popular, the people thought of releasing this movie. It's my theory that this movie was dedicated to everyone who liked the NES and its games. Super Mario 3 looked so cool, and I was pleased to know that it was officially released about a year later.In conclusion, this movie is certainly not for everyone, but if you like the NES, you'll like The Wizard."
3,dusting off an old movie which ill never see again,"eh. im not likely to ever see this movie again since it wasnt memorable for cable and certainly isnt rember by much anyone else so a DVd release wont be likely. Fred Savage is in it, and it has something to do with a cross country trip to reno for a video game contest and christian slater sucking as always. Kind of entertaing but not paticularly memorable except for the video conest itself. in the middle is a road trip of a movie. if you care for The Wonder Years dude, he's in it the whole movie. its been so long since i saw it"
1,"Movie is good, seller is not","Note to J Patenaude-the seller you bought from may have been unscrupulous and dishonest, misrepresenting the video, but that doesn't mean it is a bad movie. So why dont you take it up with Amazon? Also why dont you list the sellers ID in your review, so no one else buys from him?I liked this movie when I saw it years ago. It was very moving and touching, and as good for adults as for kids."
4,Story is still good 20+ years later,"The Wizard did not dissapoint as some other revisited childhood movies have. I was surprised how much i enjoyed this movie; it was actually better than I remebered. Its fun to see the retro excitment of the original nintendo game consel, to see Universal Studios Hollywood, California with the now deceased King Kong exhibit (R.I.P), and to see the dinosaurs off of the 10 fwy before all of the surrounding buildings and casino was built. Not to mention I almost cried at the end. I have a soft spot for kids that become mute from a tragic event in films (also used in movies like The Patriot and Scrooged). I almost forgot to mention young Fred Savage(Wonder Years) and Jenny Lewis(from the great band Rilo Kiley). I wanted to rate 5 stars but there is a lack of special features."
4,Oldie but Goodie,Heard about this movie from a friend who loves video games (as does my son)...so thought this would make a great birthday gif!
4,The Wizard!!!,"I remember this movie from when I was younger. They introduced Super Mario 3 and the glove through this movie. A great movie for those old NES players.As for the order. Fast shipping, and great DVD. Too bad it doesn't have any special features.The 4 out of 5 rating is for the movie, not the product."
1,waste of time,"This is a boring, stupid novel based on a promising premise. Should've been much better - don't waste your time!"
2,Where is the love?,"The only upside to this book is that it is a very unusual story.Other than that it is a story of utterly dislikeable characters discarding and being discarded by one another, with none of the sensuality and warmth (for people or food) of `La Cucina'."
1,"Truly, truly awful - one big yawn fest","Normally I come to [Amazon.com] to see what others have to say about books before I purchase them at discount houses. This one had two good reviews, so I went ahead and purchased it for a few dollars. I can't believe that anyone would find this book entertaining. Granted the author is poking fun at humans worst characteristics, but there was nothing at all enjoyable about reading this book. I forced myself to finish this, but there is no way I would pass this book on to anyone else, it's in the trash."
2,Not impressed,I have read two Lily Prior novels recently (it is my policy to read at least two novels by an author to judge whether or not I like them) and am frankly unimpressed. The story is ridiculous and the writing not much better.
3,"""Hang On To Your Resistance(Early Years)"".","It is a good introduction to the early years works of this talented canadian artist, however for better early works I'll recommend, ""Anthology 1980 -1987"" and ""Trapeze"", both by Tom Cochrane & Red Rider. This compilation, ""Hang On To Your Resistance(Early Years)"" is for the real fan to complete his / her collection."
4,Long Wait,"The product itself is great but it took too long to get here, almost 3 weeks. I will think twice the next time the product comes through a vendor other than directly from Amazon"
1,Beware This Book,"God Bless Ralph Sarchie and his work. Sarchie is clearly doing some admirable work in the name of the Lord. However, Sarchie is a lousy story-teller and this book is written at an 8th grade level (if not lower). This book is not in the same league as The Demonologist or The Devil in Connecticut. Those books scared me. This one did not."
5,don't read this after midnight!,"This book is chilling, but fascinating. The author is a cop who moonlights as an exorcist. His encounters with evil spirits are really scary and thrilling. THe best chapter is ""Halloween Horror"" where an evil ghost tries possess a woman while the cop was there doing the exorcism....its like a battle between good and evil. I loved it...and its non-fiction which is even scarier cos its all true! You;ll be on the edge of yr seat, definitely."
5,ABSOLUTELY INTERESTING AND CHILLING!,"Usually I pass my books on to my mother to read. This one was so good and chilling that it had me looking over my shoulder (at 42 years old) that I had to read it twice and still want to read it again! I rarely say this about a book. If you read this, make sure that you have more than one light on."
2,Another Amnittyville horror story,It's amazing how stories can get so blown out of proportion and what people write just to sell books. Other than the fact that the man claims to be a close follower of God. The book is outlandish and VERY HARD to believe. It sounds like a lot of hoowie to me.
3,A Mediocre Exorcism Book,"This is a fast read, but in the end, it's really not much. Other books, like Malachi Martin's Hostage to the Devil, work things better in how it's written and the general terror it invokes. Sarchie knew Martin, and has a picture taken with him, but neglects to mention that Martin left the Jesuits and married before he died. He also helps out with exorcisms and tosses a few off himself, which is not kosher, since the bishop of the diocese has to give permission after an exhaustive study (as Regan had in Blatty's Exorcist). I believe that exorcisms are sometimes needed, and maybe more often than we think, but I came away from the book thinking the players were all being a bit reckless."
3,"Very interesting point of view, but a little too much dogma","In general I salute this officer for his dedication and hard work in this area of his expertise. The book has many interesting experiences that he describes very well, and that all can easily learn from. Evil in this world exists. This book can help you to understand it a bit more, and recognize it when you see it. The book however had areas that were repetitive, and really pushed Catholic dogma to the point of distraction in my opinion. I too am Catholic, but I wish he'd toned it down in this area...perhaps make it more user friendly and less in your face rules and regulations that are black and white. Overall, bravo."
3,Propaganda and Scare tactics,"First, I'd like to thank the author for his service to our great city. Second, I'd like to recognize that the events he wrote about are most likely true as far as he remembers them to be. However, Sarchie takes an absolutist view and attempts to villify an entire faith, while promoting Christianity based solely on his personal experience.First, of course his experiences with Palo Mayombe are negative because no one ever calls 911 the other 99.9% of the time where it is being practiced properly, humanely and with total respect towards human and city laws. Nope, Sarchie focuses on the fringe individuals who have gone out and done their own thing, and labeled everyone for it. It it were truly an objective book, he would not have needed to inject his Christian propoganda.The three stars are for his service and accuracy of the events he experienced, but there is much to be desired in this volume. santeria.blog.com"
3,"Scary, yes, but...","This book is hard to put down and is quite a frightening read.Unfortunately Ralph Sarchie has not researched the various alternative faiths that he is so quick to put down in this book.He makes a statements that are patently untrue. For example he states that Aleister Crowley was a Satanist. Crowley was not a Satanist. He was a ceremonial magician and there is a significant difference in the implication of those two activities.An amusing aside, if burning candles and perfoming rituals are what makes someone a ""satanist"", then all Catholics are Satanists because they regularly perform more rituals and burn more wax than nearly any other faith in this world."
1,Oh dear...,"I'm a huge fan of these types of books. This one just made me irritated though. Not only does the author come across as a clichéd Van Damme/Seagal-character. He also throws in some possibly life threatening advise on how to let your infants lie in bed to avoid Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.Avoid, avoid, avoid!!!"
1,Stay Away!,"This book was extremely disappointing. Very conceited, pretentious writer who writes very badly. And way too much self-righteous proselytizing, mumbo jumbo, and flinging of holy water. He believes that every ghost, friendly or otherwise, is a demon in disguise just waiting to possess you. Sorry I wasted my money on this garbage. Don't waste yours."
1,Ugh!,It's true that no matter how idiotic beliefs can fester people's minds there's always more idiocy on the way.. This book proves this.
5,Highly recommended!! A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++,"I normally do not write reviews, but felt compelled to do so after reading this one! This was an eye-opener and I felt it was extremely informative. I think Mr. Sarchie is a brave, honest and strong man who faces the evil in two different worlds. Thank you for the insight into the ugliest part of evil."
4,Beauty is skin deep,"She is a real Plane Jane, with an efficient no nonsense approach. This is an ugly duckling waiting to transform into a swan. He is the one doing the transforming only to realise he wants to keep her for himself. A romantic, sensual, fun read."
5,IGood Read! Impressed!,"Very surprised with this one! Like others said, was very hard to put down and disappointed when i did because i could have kept on reading for a while still. Lots of books in this category are easily forgettable, this one i will always remember.So, definitely a Sandra Marton, going to read The Alvares Bride next! Hope its equally fun!!"
2,Broke in less than 1 1/2 years,"I bought this camera at walmart, not amazon. It worked pretty good for the first year or so. Now I have to buy a new camera less than 2 years after this one. The shutter will only open 60% of the time and the photos are fuzzy in till you have to turn the camera on/off a few times and switch from camera mode to view mode. I want a camera that lasts longer!"
2,not so pleased with this one,"well i bought this camera for my first digital camera and at first it was working well and took mostly good pics then about less than a year into having the camera it started goin downhill. the battery life was not good at all even after putting new batteries in and the it started saying zoom error all the time. then finally about a month ago it just decided to not work at all. with kids i always like to have then camera ready, luckily i am getting a new one that has a lot more features and am really excited."
1,Don't buy this product!!,It takes terrible pictures! Most are blurred even on sport settings and the picture loses a huge amount of quality as you zoom! I hat this camera!!
3,Pleasant enough,"The CD is pleasant enough, but I was expecting better. Steve didn't seem to sing with the same passion or umph that I was used to on previous projects. Seemed like most songs were in a key too low for him, and he never belted it out!"
5,Beyond The Law,"Beyond The Law is an excellent action thriller staring Charly Sheen and Linda Fiorentino. Charly Sheen really rocks in the roll of a cop undercover in an Arizona motorcycle gang, Linda Fiorentino does an excellent job as the woman who Charly falls for. I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a good action movie"
3,Movie,"Did'nt finish watching it. Charlie Sheen as a biker just doesn't fly. The bikers, unless retarded, would have peg him for a nark right away."
4,Good Movie,This movie is surprisingly good. I would recommend it for any one who wants a movie to pass the time that has some drama.
5,One of our family faves.,"We really enjoy this film. We needed a replacement for our original DVD. This came in next to no time, well packaged, and in beautiful condition. We are very happy with this purchase."
2,"outlaw bikers, action and Charlie Sheen on a hog","Charlie Sheen (Big Bounce, Money Talks) is a fearless cop who goes undercover to take down a mad biker squad led by Michael Madsen (Kill Bill 1 and 2, The Maker) but when he does get in he gets too much in and he gets too close to the thing he needs to stop. He also falls in love with a nice looking Linda Fiorentino (The Last Seduction, Dogma). Not much on the scale except theres a lot of bikers on hogs and some good action. Sheen is OK but doesnt cut it and Madsen is always good in evil roles (hence Kill Bill Vol. 2). Also starring Courtney B. Vance (tv's LAw and Order CSI, Eye See You), Leon Rippy (eight Legged Freaks, Kuffs) and Rip Torn (Men in Black 1 and 2, Dodgeball). Man, I want a Harley Davison so bad, its not funny, just cruise the country side, that would be the stuff right there but this movie isnt that great."
4,Not a bad old skool classic biker film,"Typical story about a police officer infiltrating an outlaw motorcycle club, getting caught up in the inticing lifestyle and has to claw himself out. Not a bad film."
4,Fixing the Shadow,"Released here in Australia under the more 'spiritual' title ""Fixing the Shadow"", this film, based on a true story, deals with an undercover cop (Sheen) who verges on the suicidal. His pain stems from the confrontation he had with his cop-step-father who abused him as a child.Sheen, encountering an Apache, learns the tale of someone who 'lost their shadow.' Thus, as Sheen goes undercover, he must confront his fears in order to be restored whole.You can bear this in mind, otherwise this would just be another biker film."
4,Voom! Vroom!,"Not realistic. Stereotypical! But, I'm a sucker for motorcycle movies. I like Chuck Sheen and the rest of the lead characters, Madsen is a riot. I like the improbale situations I've never run into in 50 years of riding. I'd recommend it. It moves along and is very amusing. True story? I'm skeptical."
5,great movie,excellent movie that used to be called fixing the shadow. not sure why the name change but there you go. only thing i could say could be better is the quality of the dvd case as i found it a little flimsy but then i am particular about protecting my dvds
4,Classic Biker Flick,"Michael Madsen and Charlie Sheen are great in this movie, and I love reality based dramas. The storyline really draws you in"
2,Returned for refund,"Movie skips and freezes in dozens of places. Also, the product description lists the video aspect ratio as letterbox, it's not. It's full-screen only."
4,biker show.,Not a bad movie based on a true story.Any way i like any movie that has linda fiorentino in it.
5,good movie and got it quick in the mail.,"Beyond The Law,this is a good movie, got it in the mail quick with no problems and watched it 1st day it came with no problems and good clear DVD movie, very happy with Amazon and the products."
2,Beyond the Law DVD,"This movie was delivered in record time, but the quality was lacking. The case was flimsy and the DVD skips all the way through."
1,sad work for charlie but given the subject little could be done,"undercover cop in biker gang, oh hum. most biker movies are fun filled crap on bikes. charlie has to work so this movie was OJT for him and the only reasonit sells at all. silly fights to prove we bad ass enough to join gang buying drugsbut never using, fall in love with girl then protect her from gang leader sounds boring doesn't it ? lines are delivered stiffly but action tearing up cars is ok."
5,OUTSTANDING BIKER MOVIE!!!!!!,"Excellent movie staring Charley Sheen, Great sountrack, makes you want to go out, buy a Harley, and hit the open road. Good plot"
3,great movie but...,"bought this new from amazon and it skipped in 3 different places,i don't know if it's because of the old quality of the dvd or not because i played it on the ps3,either way a little disappointed"
4,Good Presentation,Well done filming relatively easy to follow and good narrative with well recorded moves. Could be used for group teaching or for an individual .
4,Nice Reproductions,"Ansel Adams: Classic ImagesThis book provides high quality representations of Ansel Adams' photography in examples of 75 of his best images. The text, written by James Alinder along with a preface by John Szarkowski, portrays the story of Adams' life and his philosophy regarding art and existence. The text starts the reader off at his birth and takes you through Adams' childhood and the decisions he makes as he searches for an outlet for his creativity and a strong career path. Having also been a professional pianist, Adams' later discovers his passion for photography and nature, and spends the rest of his life a successful artist and activist.This book takes you through major events in his life and references prints in the book to give visual examples of his ever-evolving photographic style. I would definitely recommend this book, if not as a successful biography, but as a stage for some beautiful, high quality reproductions of Adams' work."
1,this remote came broken it is only for psp fat,i got this item pretty fast it only works for psp 1000 do not order this if you have a slim when i got this item it came broken be preperd to return it make sure it is working i cant say this is a good product it feels super cheap like it was made with sand it is fragile so take care of it overall not a product to buy
1,It doesn't work with the PSP headset,"I was under the impression that this would work just the same as the retail headset, but it did not work when I attached the headset. I also know that it is the remote control that is the problem because the headset works on his retail remote."
3,Cant complain for the PRICE,"I bought this for my PSP so that I can use it as a mp3 player. I wanted the remote option because the PSP is a bit big for a pant pocket and also a bit big to take in and out of your pocket. The remote works OK, the buttons feel a bit cheap and if you are not careful it will go back in a song when you are trying to go forward or skip songs when you are trying to fast forward or rewind. THe unit has PSP logos on it and seems like its a genuine sony product but when you use it you feel the cheapness in the plastic and buttons and know that it is not.The headphones sound ok. I am using my pair of sony headphones that i have had from before.People are complaining about the length of the cord but i like it because you can put the psp in your back pack and still have enough cord to move around comfortablyOverall for $5 bucks you cant lose I am just giving a nitpickers review but $5 dollars and fully functioning you may give it a shot :)"
2,"book was fine, not what was to be expected.","the book is in great shape and has alot of test questions relevant for that version of the book, BUT it's for test prep ONLY, not for class and homework related work! ONLY buy if you want test preparations.."
2,Men's Florsheim shoes,I never received the item ordered. I was given a refund because the item was no longer available. Why was it even on the website if in fact it was no longer available? At least I was given a prompt refund.
1,Bad Shock Absorber,"I am a school teacher and have used the Florsheim Magna Force for the past 10 years. This year I decided to switch to the Florsheim Men's Noble Oxford. The heal of the Oxford has a rubber shock absorber bubble for ""more comfort"". The shock absorber bubble literally burst and ripped on both shoes. This may have been a defect but being that both shoes had the same problem troubles me. The company I used was endless.com and they have a great free return policy for a full refund. I decided not to buy the Noble Oxford's and instead will buy another Florsheim without the shock absorber bubble at the bottom of the heal."
2,defective product,"- the sole of the shoe is coming away from the leather upper after only 5 months of wear- I have had this problem happen all too frequently with Florsheim shoes- oddly, it hasn't (yet?) occurred with shoes bought from a physical store- it will certainly give me pause before ordering on-line again- a disappointment"
2,"Great Brand, Bad Shoe","Florsheim shoes are the shoes that my father wore and that I couldn't wait to get for myself once I hit the working world. I grabbed the Noble style because I wanted it's rubber sole for durability. I spend a lot of time on my feet at trade shows so I figured that this was a home run.Regrettably, this shoe really hurt the balls of my feet for some reason. I've never had foot problems before but something about how the shoe was cut and/or the soles of it just didn't sit right with me. I still own the shoes and they have the proper ceder shoe trees in them but I never wear them. I bought a pair of Florsheim Maloy shoes and love them. While not as durable and I've now worn them through, they were much more comfortable!"
3,Surprised,"I bought this book because I had to do a report on a female leader and it needed to be someone that wasn't as famous as the Margaret Thatchers and the Hillary Clintons of the world. I was surprised because Muriel Siebert is extremely well versed in the financial world and has done so much for wall street and I had never heard of her. I was also surprised because I thought the book would be a total bore because I am not into the stock exchange or any financial ""stuff."" The book was a very interesting read and Muriel Siebert is an interesting lady."
3,a good starter belt...,"Good quality belt. Thick, stiff, durable. The buckle is plastic but is durable also. The buckle will eventually snap under the most EXTREME use but seems fine for normal use. If you want an indestructible belt definitely get one with a metal buckle in the $40+ range."
2,Too thick,"What you cannot see in the picture is that when you have the clips on, the belt is looped over itself. It becomes so thick that you have to take off a clip and unfold one side of the belt just to put on/ take off the belt. Also the inside of the belt is velcro creating friction tesulting in more difficulty sliding it throw belt hoops. Overall it works but its a bit of a pain being so thick."
2,not what I expected in a law enforcement belt,"OK so I rant a bit. But I may have to depend on a rope hanging from this belt and the description when it arrived stated ""light to moderate duty."" OK thats for who. If I am hanging from a rope, I can't depend on the buckle which is not well described. I would have expected more from Uncle Mike's."
5,Supurb,"Use for outside, non-conceal carry when running training or range duties with my full size semi-autos and in conjunction with the Blackhawk keepers. great buy!"
4,its a great belt,"its a great belt, but its hard to put in and out because its wide, but its a great belt"
4,The Attack - 'Final Daze' (Angel Air) 4 1/2 stars,"A fantastic seventeen track CD of The Attack's repertoire recorded sometime between 1967-68. Wasn't aware of it until now, but I don't believe they ever released an 'actual' album. 'Final Daze' looks to be a compilation of the several / unreleased singles they had apparently put out. For those of you who may not know,T he Attack was John Du Cann's band before Five Day Week Straw people and Andromeda. Superb British mod-psychedelic rock & roll to be fully taken in. Tunes that more than make this CD a true keeper are the two versions of ""Magic In The Air"", ""Mr.Pinnodmy's Dilemma"" (about a cripple, in which others poke fun at), ""Feel Like Flying"", ""Sleep Like A Child"", ""You Know He Did"", ""Earth Tremor"" and ""Spaced Out"". Comes with an informative 16-page booklet. Line-up: John Du Cann - guitar & vocals, Richard Shirman - vocals, Roger Deane - bass and Keith Hidge - drums. An absolute must-have."
5,Two Religions - One Problem !!!,"I think ""Across the barricades"" is a very good and exiting book about two young people with big problems. Sometimes you can't imagine that only the religion could be such a big problem. You also won't believe, that there are people who don't like this friendship and that they use weapons against it. It's not only a story - it's true and that's very sad. And it is fantastic that they have the power to go through it. I also like that there are people who have no problems with this relationship and that they help them in these hard times. It's a pitty that this friendly people have to die ... only because one person doesn't like a friendship between a Catholic and a Protestant. But finaly it's a happy ending but you don't know if they will have the chance to live a better life in an other city. I'm glad that my english-teacher had offered me the chance to read this wonderful book in his very interesting english-lessons."
4,A book with atitude!,I first saw this book when my english teacher MADE me read it and i wasn't to pleased about it!But now i have read it..it has left me thinking about it all the time!I think this is a great book.it really shows you what it was like when all the fighting was going on in Irland and how love can survive anything.
3,Exciting,"I read it some years ago, in school and thought it was a really great book. I learned something about the conflict, in a good way."
3,"Thayer Witch Hazel AF Toner, Rose Pental",I use this for cleasing skin after wash and very good for my dry skin.I'm feeling my skin is more clear and more smooth after using it.
4,I like it!,"I've been eyeing this toner for a while because of all the good reviews and decided to buy it a few months back.This toner is very moisturizing for my face and doesn't irritate it at all! I have oily, acne-prone skin and I haven't broken out from using this yet.I don't, however, find it super refreshing on my face. Probably because it doesn't contain alcohol like the other toners I've used in the past. Other than that, I have absolutely no problems (:The seller shipped this to me fast and I very much appreciate that!I would recommend this to a friend"
4,A great toner,This is a great toner and feels incredibly soft on my skin. The only thing that would make it better is if it were all natural.
2,cloudy after a month,At first this product was great. I enjoyed the scent and it toned my skin. After awhile the product clouded up and the smell has kind of a sour smell now. I will not buy this product again although I will keep the bottle and refill with another kind of witch hazel. The bottle was the main reason I was attracted to this product.
5,Gentle toner,"If you have sensitive skin, this is a great toner/cleanser to use. I just moisten a cotton ball with this product, and use it on my face and neck. It contains no alcohol, so it's not drying. I love the light rose scent."
2,Drying,I wasn't impressed by this product. It was too drying for my combo skin. I prefer aloe toners than the witch hazel.
3,Wanted to love it,The product felt good on my skin. I just could not get past the scent. I found that I had to splash my face after applying to get rid of the smell. I bought the cucumber and it is great. I think it is all down to personal preference with scent.
5,Can't be without it,"I'm the type of person who bounces from product to product, ever in search of that elusive glow the movie stars and television ads promise is just within my reach. However, when I got about halfway done with the bottle (two months after initially purchasing, meaning I had another two months to go) I started to panic that I would run out before I ordered the next bottle. It is that good.Saw some results after just a few days of use, but as I continue to use it the results are more dramatic. My skin is soft and clear and glowing and looks very healthy.The rose smell is very refreshing. It might seem a little strong when you first put it on (especially if you're using a lot!) but it quickly fades."
5,LOVE IT...NEVER WANT TO BE WITHOUT IT!!!,"I purchased this for myself. I can't believe that I had never heard of this product before! The smell is AMAZING!!! It does everything it promises too also...leaves my skin feeling clean, but NOT dry. Just very soft and smooth. I won't be letting myself run out of this product...I'm also anxious to try the lavender version :)"
5,Gets rid of facial redness,"I have really red skin and this mellows it out perfectly and leaves my skin soft. I don't know about oil control, but I'm not red when I use it."
2,Not for Oil Skin,"Let me start by saying I think this is a good product just not good for my skin type. I have oily/acne prone skin and typically only purchase oil-free products but I read so many great reviews on this product I decided to give it a try as I am trying to go more ""green"" in every aspect of my life - skin care included. The rose smells wonderful and the actual product feels very soothing over your skin. I used this product for about a week once a day and immediately began noticing my face getting oiler throughout the day. I started to break out (outside of the usual) and my pores were actually getting larger. Since nothing else in my skin care routine has changed yet I determined it to be Thayers, probably because of the natural oils and tannins. I stopped using this product and tried Dickerson's witchhazel (oil-free but does contain alcohol) which has worked out much better for me. If you have oily skin I would not recommend this product, I really wish it worked though!!"
4,Refreshing,This is a refreshing toner to use in the morning. Makes skin feel clear and bright. This toner does not make me break out or cause my skin to dry out. And you only need a little to spread about your face. I like that the top is a squirt top so only a little comes out at a time. That way you can avoid accidentally spilling some. If you do need more you can just squeeze the bottle.The scent is unique and is not my favorite thing in the world. But it wears off quickly and is not that strong.I will make this a normal part of my skin care routine!
5,great toner!,"I got this scent along with another scent and I am very glad I did. Love the scent of roses and anyone who is familiar with witch hazel knows that it doesn't smell so great, lol glad I decided to give this try. I use it as a toner and it removes any makeup left over from my face wash while keeping it hydrated. Now I'm interested in trying the aloe and lemon one....... Hmmmm will do so once I run out of these 2 bottles."
2,Not impressed!,"I bought this product mainly to use as a toner. I read that rose petals and witch hazel are great products for the skin. Well, after a couple of weeks use, I did not see any changes in my skin. I used the entire bottle and still I did not notice a difference. It smells good but perhaps my expectations were too high. I will not purchase this item again."
1,I Love Rose Scent but....,I Love Rose Scent but....I had to literally throw this away!The scent .... was so STRONG...it gave me a headache!I have never had trouble with any product where the Rose scent was too strong!
1,I can't believe what I used was a deteriorated one,"I can't believe the toner I used was a deteriotaed one, until I used it up and recently bought another one which is colorless. The toner should be colorless, but what I received from this seller is milky white!!!I can't believe I bought it from amazon, I am so disappointed. I thingk I will need to do a lot more research before I buy something on amazon after this experience."
2,Honest Review,I have nothing against this product but I really didn't like it that much.1) It has a strong smell ( it isn't a pleasant smell but I could handle it)2) It leaves my skin pretty sticky. (I read other comments and now I have learned my lesson)3) The smell dwells on my skin even after I put on my moisturizer.And for it also made my skin pretty itchy. But I think that's probably because I might be allergic to something.I gave it 2 stars because it doesn't stink as bad as some people said it does.
1,Allegic,"My friend recommended this product to me. Unfortunately I am allergic to it. After using, my skin was itchy. So I stop using it."
5,Love this stuff,I use this as an aftershave and my girlfriend uses it as a moisturizer before bed. It's got a wonderfully light scent and the witch hazel is very good for soothing one's skin. I love it and will definitely get more if I ever run out.
4,Refreshing,"This is a nice refreshing toner that leaves your skin soft and moisturized. I have had a few breakouts, but I can't say this product was the cause."
2,White particles???,"After seeing all the good reviews, I decided to give this toner a try. Although I do like it (it has a nice scent and is very gentle), I don't feel that it made any significant improvements to my skin. Also, after a couple months, I found white particles floating everywhere in the bottle. I'm not sure what this is, but it's quite disappointing since I only used about a third of the bottle... Does anyone know what this could be? :("
2,Blotchy,"I actually think this makes my skin blotchier/reddier. Would not recommend! I have combination skin with an oily t-zone. This would be perfect for dry/normal skin, but it did nothing with mind and only made it blotchy."
1,such an old product,"I received a ""THAYERS rose petal witch hazel"" , but I saw ""2007/11"" on the bottom. After check previous reviews, I know I am cheated too."
4,Very fragrant,"The fragrance is the most impacting of the various characteristics of this product. This toner moisturizes my skin for hours at a time, keeping me from being shiny, with very little greasy aftermath. All-in-all a good product."
1,Causes Break outs,"I thought this product would help prevent or heal up my acne prone skin. I rarely get break outs, however after a week of using this product, my skin broke out horribly, even in places it doesn't usually get acne/pimples in. Completely wasted my money...I guess for acne prone skin, do not buy. Maybe it is helpful for people who have skin that is not prone to acne already. It does moisturize. However in my case my skin got oily(even though it is never oily) and all my pores became horribly clogged."
5,The Magic Potion,"This is my first review and I have no ties to the product. I will say that I have been dealing with embarassing acne on my chest and neck for several years; I noticed a remarkable change just days after using this product. I'm not sure how it does what it does, but it really has been the magic cure for which I have searched for almost a decade. My esteem is higher, and I am not nearly as self-conscious. I know that is silly, but it is true."
2,Nothing great,I am very disappointed with this product because I see nothing great. I used to use Bulgarian rose water purchased from amazon as my toner. It used to tighten my pores and give me a good fresh feeling. Also my skin looked great when i was using it. I tried this for a change and nothing great infact i broke out after using it. Not liking this product
2,Stinky,"I believe other people may have had a better experience than me but if you are sensitive to strong fragrances, you may not like this. Maybe when I am a bit older I will appreciate a product like this...just not now."
4,Great product for a great price,"Acts as a good make up remover and toner. Does a great job of removing the residue that facial soaps leavebehind. I know Thayer makes other variations of their witch hazel toners, and I'd definitely want to try their lemon or lavender to compare. I feel like my skin feels smoother and appears healthier overall."
4,My opinion of the toner,The smell is good. And it is quite cheap considering the bottle shape. Skin feels smooth and comfortable after using it.
4,nice toner,"This is my first toner ever. I quite like the product. It gets the left over makeup out after cleansing. Leaves the skin moisturized. The smell is also pleasent.I have oily skin, so it feels a tiny bit shiny after using this toner. But wiping once with a towel just makes it fine."
2,it doesn't work for me,"this product is not that magical, i feel uncomfortable when i using it,it do smells good, but it just doesn't work for me."
3,ok product,I am using this product for 7-8 months now & I don't think it makes any difference to my skin. I mean no positive or negative effect. So probably I vl not buy this again.
2,But it contains nasty ingredients!,"I was looking for a natural toner to replace my favourite Humphries - I saw that there were many good reviews for this one and considered buying it until I looked at the ingredients.It contains Butylene Glycol & Methylparaben which have been flagged by the skincare website as damaging and carcinogenic to skin cells.I am sorry, but this is just not natural enough for me."
3,"Like the product, HATE the smell","I like this product as a toner, but the smell is GHASTLY. The only way I can describe it is that it reminds me of dill pickles. Which I really would rather not smell on my face. Ugh. Definitely trying a different scent next time."
1,Caused oily skin and pimples,"While I was excited to use this product, my skin does not like it. Having used it for 3 weeks, I have stopped as pimples have been appearing on my face more and more as I use the product, and my skin is much more oily than it has ever been before. It may work well for others but only did harm for me."
1,La Historia Continua Parte 2,I just put two of Marc Antonio Solis' CDs in my basket. But you / he can't be serious to think I'll buy La Historia Continua Vol 2 without actually hearing any of it. If you / he want to make a sale you have to give people some idea what they're buying. Kate Rusby sold me a lot of songs that way.
4,Star Ocean EX Review,"As said, this game is based on the Playstation game: Star Ocean 2. I've seen the whole series through subtitles, and for fans of the game it's quite good. I think knowing what's going to happen really doesn't matter here, since the series was scrapped in Japan (though the second half was released on audio-only discs). Star Ocean EX on DVD covers the first disc of the game through a Claude/Rena/Celine/Ashton storyline, and you will notice many side-characters from the game as well as people from Private Actions performed in the game. All in all, if you're a fan of the game definetly check this out. If you're not, you may be disappointed with the low-quality animation and somewhat bouncy storyline. This anime also has a good amount of humor to go with the action-based plot."
4,Very god,Very goos product. I recommend yo buy this toy for cabildeen and for collectors. Buy it is not vintage toy
4,THE WAY I REMEMBERED IT,"My father bought the 33 1/3 LP of Delirium in Hi-Fi in the early 1960s, and that record entertained my younger sisters and me for hours, whenever we could persuade him to play it. By the time I finished high school in 1969, I never thought I'd hear these pieces again, but one day recently I googled it anyway. I wasn't sure at first whether it was the same album - the LP had a different cover (reproduced in the CD insert), and the LP said it was by Elsa Popping and her Pixieland Band. I don't remember it being credited to Andre Popp on the LP. But they're the same, as the insert explains, and it is just the way I remember it. In fact, while it has been nearly 40 years since I've heard it, I could recall and anticipate every nuance. Memory is such a remarkable phenomenon!"
4,Decent,These frames are great for hanging a collection of pictures on the wall. The only complaint I have is there are not enough fasteners on the back of the frame. There is only one per frame.You just have to make sure you secure the glass and wood with that one fastener perfectly.
2,Careful!,"The glass is thin and not shatterproof; drop one of these and you'll get tiny super sharp glass shards everywhere. As others have noted, no hooks to hang them on some of the frames."
3,"Great valued, poor quality","Be clear, for this price you can't complain. I have ordered this item 3 times and each time I am content with what I am buying. However, you can buy flat black frames for $20 a piece and they should be very high quality. These are not. With what I am paying, I am very pleased."
4,nice product,"everything came nicely packed. I ordered two sets. nothing amiss or broken. would recommend. hard to find bundles so you can have a wall collage with matching frames. can't beat the price. i searched elsewhere generally more expensive. one site offered same product, and charged discount for each additional set, but they would take much longer to ship, so all in all still worth the the 10dollar difference."
3,OK in a pinch.,"These are not the most high quality frames I've ever had, but they are just about the cheapest. And, for what they are, they are fine. Because they are the same style, they give a nicely organized look to pictures I like to keep on my shelves. (They don't seem to be sturdy enough to hang on the wall.)You should be aware that there really aren't sufficient ""clips"" in the back, and a bit of tape was needed on the back of one to stabilize it. But they do have a look worth much more than the price paid. I pretty much got what I expected -- as good as the frames you find in the family dollar type shops. However, these do give you the appearance of a nicely matched display, and there's enough here for me to add a whimsical picture or two from a post card or magazine to make it fun."
3,Ok for the price,"This product turned out to be ok for the price. I got a set in black and a set in the wood finish. The black set actually only came with 9 frames in it for some reason but Amazon quickly resolved the problem.The backs of the frames where the pictures is held in is actually a bit cheap and doesn't stay together the best.The fronts look nice however.If you're looking for a bunch of decent looking frames this is probably one of your best options, if you want high quality frames you should probably look else where."
2,very dangerous.,"These are made with very thin glass and when I purchased it, the glass was chipped on one of them and left tiny shreds of glass everywhere when I opend the box. Would be a great buy except that. That is why I cannot buy any online now, I have to see them myself."
3,Nice but not made of wood,"These are nice portraits, but they are deffinitely not made of wood as they sell it, just black hard plastic, does not even look like wood.-I dont mind, I like them, but if you are looking for wood frames, these are not the ones.-"
4,Great Value,"I bought 2 of these sets and used them in my office. The effect is just as good as a ""photowall"" set that costs 10 times as much. Be aware that if you're hanging these frames on a wall you'll need to tear the stands off for them to hang well. And the smallest size doesn't have hanging hardware attached, so you'll need to rig something up for those - but they are very lightweight so that's simple enough."
4,Great value!,"This was exactly what I was looking for. I had a number of black and white photos of different sizes that I wanted to group together. And this worked PERFECTLY. The frames are good quality and look nice, not cheap at all (like the price would suggest.) I'm very happy with them!"
4,Love it! I'm getting yet another set!!,"When I first bought this set, I was a little worried about the quality, since it was so cheap. Thankfully, when they arrived, I was proven wrong. Every frame was perfectly squared, no defects, and they all hang perfectly straight! I've already bought two sets, and I'm definitely going to order more!"
3,good value... great price,"I needed 5x7 frames for a bunch of pictures, and this box of 10 frames that only included four 5x7 frames was cheaper than buying even TWO 5x7 frames separately... and the quality is pretty good and they look fine - not super gorgeous, but fine...Only thing is that I now have 6 other frames taking up space... i don't seem to use the other sizes... the 4x6 pics i'll use, but the teeny ones and the 8x10... useless to me."
3,Long ago and a quiet a bit younger,I used to have a vinyl copy of this and I wore it out. This is just a typical Wishbone Ash cd. Every song on it is good and will get stuck in your player.
3,Wishbone Ash - Trying To Find A Direction,"Like a lot of Wishbone Ash's albums from this era I find a mix of pretty good songs and a few real clunkers. In many ways the band often seemed to be in search of a direction and ""Front Page News"" is a prime example of this. The music is all over the place with ballads, bluesy numbers, rockers, singer / songwriter type stuff and even some 70's style dance groves. Some of the better tracks include the title track, ""Surface To Air"", ""714"", ""Come In From The Rain"" and the catchy ""Diamond Jack"". There are also some real duds like ""Heart Beat"". It just seems like a strange mix to me, and I find this with several of their albums. Like ""New England"" and ""Four"" there is quite a bit to like here, but I would not say it is an essential album."
3,Works,My real complaint is the fact that this was made during the time when all of the chargers and batteries were proprietary and led to huge price gouges due to lack of choice. The new USB standard is a great improvement.
1,Don't waste your time or money,I have read most of Susan Johnson's books and was greatly disappointed in this one. There is no tenderness or affection between the main characters. The male character is a faithless dog who treats the female character like property. It is impossible for any sensible person to understand what these two people see in each other and it's depressing to read about it.
1,Even the love scenes aren't worth it,"I've read a lot of Susan Johnson's novels and this is probably the one I like the least. Even the love scenes couldn't help this one. They were so boring that I ended up ""fast forwarding"".I was so irritated with the characters that I didn't make it past the first 10 pages. After two more attempts, I was finally able to finish it. But it was a struggle.The ""hero"" of the story was a total, unmitigated jerk. ""Hero"" would be a misnomer...""anti-hero"" would probably be more accurate.I guess one redeeming fact is that it did prompt a deep emotion in me...namely, I got so mad at the ""heroine"" I actually shouted out loud ""why the h*ll do you want this jerk? why do you keep crawling back to him! AAARRRGGGHHH!!!! So stupid!!!!""If you're looking for a erotic romance, this isn't it. But if all you care about is sex, sex, and more boring sex, this one is for you."
2,Disappointed....,"I&#65533;m a big SJ fan and have most of her books. But I must say I am very disappointed with her work lately. I kept reading Again and again waiting for the real story to emerge. But alas it never did. Just two people bickering and having sex. After a while all this sex just gets old. There&#65533;s no anticipation just details of the act. I&#65533;m so tired of her characters snipping at each other. That&#65533;s not love. Not even close&#65533;Where&#65533;s the story, the longing, the love???? This book has nothing to recommend it. Unless you want to read nothing but sex acts.Susan&#65533; you need to get back to your roots. Taboo, Brazen, Outlaw, and Sliver Flame, now that&#65533;s good writing&#65533;"
3,It's not what you think!,"I am a huge fan of SJ. I have read nearly all her books. Of late she has been moving toward the erotic side of romance, and away from the traditional aspects of the genre. If you like steamy, kinky sex scenes this book is for you. I personally enjoyed the book. I gave it 3 stars because I didn't really understand what was going on between Caroline and Simon. I thought she should have delved a little further into their past, but since it is obvious that Caroline was about 12 or 13 when her sexual escapades began. I understand why she stayed away from it. Overall, the book is what it is. It is erotica. I had to join in after reading a couple of the previous reviews. The book wasn't bad. It just isn't erotic romance like her other books. It is pure erotica. Take it or leave it."
2,Not as good as her other titles..,"The biggest flaw I found in this particular book was the violence between the two main characters, Simon and Caroline. It appeared that every time these two came together, there was slapping and verbal abuse toward the other. This kind of turned me off from what little romance Ms. Johnson was trying to accomplish between the two. I can understand Caro's reluctance to get involved with Simon after his indiscretion five years earlier but when she did decide to ""bed"" him again, she turned wishy washy and verbally abuse toward him. There was too much bitterness and mistrust between the lead characters to really believe in any kind of romance or happily ever after for them. I hope Ms.Johnson's next book will give us the sensuality and romance that she is famous for."
1,[money] down the tubes!,"All the other reviewers have said what was needed! I found it boring in the extreme. How many sex scenes can you fit into a non-plot? There was one instance when the author probably forgot she was in the 1800's. The hero and heroine was stuck in an inn during a snowstorm - carriage and horses could not get thru, right? Well, how did the heroine skip out the next morning on the stage? Did the author bring in a 20th Century snowplow along with the 20th C ""dirty"" dialogue?Will not read this author again- second time burned!"
3,:),"I have to say that this book was a bit too vulgar form my taste. And it didn't have any connection to the era in which it was set. And the heroine was a nymphomaniac. Apart from that, it was quite an entertaining book."
2,What gives?,"I consider myself a fan of Susan Johnson and have recommeded her books to many friends around the world. I am very disappointed (yet again) by her recent writings. I find myself in a dilemma, do I stick around for the next few..hoping for a return of her earlier writing style (Hot with a plot)? or do I bid a fond farewell to an old friend? Hmmm?!"
2,Nowhere as good as the old stuff,I thought I'd weigh in on the Susan Johnson discussion. The older books were certainly longer with much more interesting stories -- with twists and turns. The books are getting shorter with very boring story lines (you know how it will unfold by the end of the first chapter). I hope she goes back to the old syle -- giving us more bang for the buck. We want it steamy and interesting. (I read this book in the bookstore -- wouldn't spend the money.)
2,Again and Again? More like please no more,Dull book. I read the whole book with the hopes that it would get better at the end. It didn't.
1,Terrible book. An author I won't read again.,"The story line was weak and I disliked both main characters. Caroline was weak willed and kept going back to a main who was cruel to her. I disliked Simon's whole character. He was great looking, so what, he was a brute. I also disliked all the crude language which was unnecessary."
2,Not her Best,"They never said I love you, when both of them realized they couldn't live without one another. Plus there was no romance in this story at all, just lust."
1,Not worth your time,This book is a complete waste of time--I didn't like either of the main characters and found myself struggling to finish. WHY? It did not deserve to be finished. I would absolutley NOT recommend this book.
1,Absolute Trash,"I haven't read a romance novel in years and I certainly hope this isn't what every author has degraded to. This took no talent at all to write. I can't imagine anyone with a real life reading stuff like this. As far as the plot, all I can say is that's it's about the same as what you might see while flipping through late-night TV and you happen upon one of those dirty channels and see something gosh awful before you can press the button again. Don't waste your money. ANd this woman should be ashamed of herself!"
1,sorry,"I think it was stupid! I don't want to ruin the end for anyone, but le't just say ""it's Studid"" I had issues with the husband and wife sleeping with others - just like that! I'm sorry, but i wouldn't recommend this to anyone. also, Dean Martin was very obnoxious being ""Dino""."
2,Get these nine films + The Seven Year Itch for 20 pounds at Amazon.UK,"One hundred and seven US Dollars! No thanks Amazon.com. I went to Amazon.UK and got the PAL region 2 versions of The Billy Wilder Collection (Vol.'s 1 and 2) for 20 pounds. You can use your Amazon.com account and even with the extra shipping costs to the USA, you'll save over $60. Current price at Amazon.co.uk for both boxsets is 20 pounds 38 pence(10 pounds 19 pence each set). These two sets together also contain 'The Seven Year Itch' which isn't in the above region 1 set and as the region 2 sets are also released by MGM I'm sure the image sources will be the same and therefore the image quality identical. Do yourself a favour and ALWAYS check Amazon.co.uk before buying something on Amazon.com!Zero stars for the price, 4 and a half stars for 'Witness for the Prosecution' and 'The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes' - total = 2 stars"
3,It's OK but not comprehensive,I work as an interpreter and it has come in handy for some colloquial terms and bad language but it does not include some pretty common terms and sayings so it's not 100% dependable.
3,A nice little romance,"This romance, set on a Nevada ranch called Valley of the Sun where a hard-working woman is struggling to keep the dream of a new well alive during the worst drought in years. Enter Rio, a half-Indian hydrologist whose true name is Brother-to-the-wind. Hope and Rio try to keep from loving each other, but because this is a romance novel, we all know they're not going to succeed. With all the talk of water, though, this book will definitely make you thirsty."
3,Was not what was expected,I usually enjoy books by Elizabeth Lowell but I am half way through this book and I have to force myself to finish it. The book is very predictable and I feel that just because the hero and heroine have to love each other she makes them do that. Even though I do believe in love at first sight this seems a bit forced. There is not enough description of the attraction just that they are attracted to each other. It seems that I have read this storyline time and time before so I could predict what would happen next. This book is just writing for the sake of writing and it does not grab one's attention.
2,DISHONEST & DISAPPOINTING,"As a big and loyal fan of Elizabeth Lowell - I have almost all of her books under her various author names - I was very disappointed. I recognize the trend to republish early books by well-known authors, but I did not realize that this hard back book was a reissue. Usually I check the publication date to determine if it is a reissue or a new book.It was disappointing, as are many early works of today's fine authors. I would have purchased the book in paperback to add to my collection, but would not have paid the hard cover price."
1,beatiful dreamer,"I was very disapointed with this book I waited months for it to come out,and when it finally did I found it I already hade it printed under the other title it was put out many years ago,called Valley of the Sun. I was very disapointed considering I am a very big fan of Elizabeth Lowells....."
3,Struggled to Like It,"The plot had potential, since it is usually hard to go wrong with a Western romance featuring a beautiful and gutsy gal and a tall, dark and handsome half-breed cowboy, but flowery writing and a redundant ""I'm the wind"" mantra weighed the story down. And does it really make you dreamer to want to find water for your poor skinny cows? It just was not one of Elizabeth Lowell's best books."
4,"A quick, satisfying read--","I don't regularly read the roamnce genre, but I do have a sofft spot for cowboys, and this is a quick, very satisfying story, with likeable characters and good story. The ending is quite fairy-tale like--I really wish people were as kind and fair and generous as they are here--but that didn't ruin it at all.This novel also has excellent, sultry love scenes. There is true feeling and passion here."
3,langhorne,"I enjoyed this book very much. Still new to romance novels I have trouble witht he abrupt endings. I want more than happily ever after. I have been married for 16 years and the trouble did not start until we were married 2 years, that is when the marriage was challenged. I love the stories of people coming together, fighting their emotions, reasoning with themselves, and finally giving in to what works for them. In Beautiful Dreamer they are well matched and beautifully painted against the backdrop of Nevada. I could see it, I could feel it, I could almost smell it. My only regret is we will never know if it lasted. After all...Brother -of-the-Wind..."
4,Fuel Faucet,"Worked great on my MSR fuel bottle. For my rough and tumble kayaking trips, i prefer to use the normal bottle top, and then replace it with this just to refill. It replaces the need to bring a funnel along.I wouldn't keep it on my bottle all the time. It doesn't leak when in the closed position, but i worry that it will get twisted during the trip and leak.The instructions say to twist the top 180 degrees open, put your finger over the little hole on the top and then pour into the tank. However, keeping your finger over the hole stops the fuel from flowing freely. You definitely want to keep your finger OFF the hole or you'll be pouring all day."
2,Pours neatly but leaks,"I was excited to get this item, (the first one) but it wouldn't seal closed. No matter how tightly is was closed it still leaked. I returned it and ordered a second one. The second one is a little better but I wouldn't trust it in my backpack. When turned upside down it has a fairly recurring drip. Otherwise it pours very nicely and turns off when you put your finger over the hole on top. Too bad it has to leak."
3,Nancy Must Find the Stolen Money,"River Heights is a buzz. It's the annual Biking for Bucks charity race. This is a big event in the city and Nancy and her friends are excited to be part of the two day event. But that's before someone lets Ned's car roll into a creek and lets the air out of their bike tires. But the worst is that the money pledged has been stolen. Now Nancy needs to track down the missing money before the rest of the town finds out that the money is missing.Having really enjoyed the first book of these relaunches, I decided to give the second a try. Again, I enjoyed the characterizations. This time, I felt the plot was lacking more then the first book. Maybe it's because I'm older then the target audience, but I found the dual plots rather obvious. And the bike ride made little to no sense, especially the race aspect of things.Over all, I think young kids will enjoy these books, but the lack of decent mysteries will make older kids pass on them for the originals."
4,Good mystery,"In this book, Nancy has to find out who had stolen the money for the River Heights Biking for Bucks charity Race. The mystery and the suspense were great -- better than the first book. Even the characters were more developed. I'm off to read the next one!"
5,I love Nancy Drew!,Nancy is asked to help find a missing horse. At the same time she is starring in a movie made by a college friend. The setting of the movie is an abandoned Victorian house and the stable mysteriously burns down. Other attempts are also made to harass the group. Will Nancy be able to solve these mysteries? You bet ya!
4,Those Thrilling Days of Yesteryear,"While this book had its rough spots, it was very interesting and fair.Ashley looks at the history of science fiction magazines from the origin of magazines themselves to 1950. There is an awful lot of interesting information here on how magazines developed differently in Britain and the US.When Ashley gets to the 1926-50 era, he is marvellous when covering the major magazines. He avoids overt deification or demonization and seems quite even-handed when dealing with the ""Shaver hoax."" Also, he does not take the route that when John W. Campbell became editor of Astounding all the other magazines ceased to be of interest.This is essential reading for those interested in the early development of science fiction."
3,"ADEQUATE, BUT DEFINATELY NOT SCHRADERS BEST","This isnt a great movie, but its worth watching. Paul Schrader misses on this one. At certain points the movie hits dead on, but the rest off it just plain dies. All the actors do a great job, but the story and pace lag and falter at times. Technically, some of the scenes are great, particularly the end conclusion."
3,Enjoyable enough,"This isn't one of Winona's best movies. You can ask her that yourself. She even tried to get out of it after a script revision (something about a sex scene---and if you follow Winona's career like I do---she doesn't base her career on being sexy)but was threatened to get sued.Oddly enough, I still find myself watching this movie from time to time. Its got a great cinematography and a great soundtrack. Ok, plus, I'm a die-hard Winona fan. No shoplifting scandal or a bad movie choice can ever change that. LOL!Oh yeah---this is based on the James Salter short ""Twenty Minutes"", which I read and actually thought a better story than the movie."
4,Boys is better than typical review,"I like Winona Ryder, so I gave this movie a try. It has a ""Graduate"" kind of humor about an unconventional love story, though a younger boy lead. Lucas Haas, Skeet Ulrich, Chris Cooper, Jessica Harper, Catherine Keener, John C. Reilly., and others make a great cast. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it and liked the unpredictable ending.Maybe the politically correct monitors dumped on this movie to make it less than it was. Maybe that is why no one saw it. I certainly enjoyed it."
2,A 17 year old coming of age story for 12 year olds,"One of the dumbest movies I have seen in a long time. The plot is beyond unbelievable, too inconsistant and hackneyed to allow any suspension of disbelief. The only reason I didn't give it one star is that Winona is still lovely to look at."
3,A little boring...but otherwise ok,"Like I said before, a little bit boring but otherwise ok. This movie was hard to understand and I didn't get the plot at all. What I am looking for is the name of that one hot blonde dude that was a friend of John Baker's in this movie? Also, where can I find some pics of him? Anyone know, please e-mail me at icycool7227@aol.com. Thanks!!"
5,SGGK,An excellent edition of the text with facing-page Middle English and modern English translation that replicates the sound and cadences of the original--ideal for use in undergraduate courses on medieval English literature. Broadview is one of the best publishers of medieval and early modern literature textbooks.
4,supportive,Supportive yet comfortable. It isn't too bulky so my foot fits well in my shoes. I use these for volleyball and would recommend them.
4,great ankle support,these ankle braces are good support for the athlete wearing them. my only suggestion would be to make the elastic part of the brace to be more durable. these are wore for basketball and for the amount paid the elastic should hold up better for daily use.
1,Don't buy!,I purchased two pair of these braces and they are not worth the money. The material is cheap and the brace is poorly constructed. My attempts to contact the company were unsucessful. We're switching back to the McDavid braces which are Podiatrist recommended.
2,BAD!!!!!!!!!,I thought oh good reviews must be a good game. I was wrong once you enter a room it has to load and it always loads. i do like the backrounds but this is a horible game. you fight and thats it pretty much through the whole game is the same thing.dont waste your money on this.this game is way too easy.
5,Please Love Me,"Awesome book; one of much help to me in a time of untangling ""unresolved issues"" (as defined by Paul Tripp). Be sure to read the epilog... but not until AFTER you've read Hedi's whole story!"
4,12-year-old review,It has been over 12 years since I read this book. I just remember liking the book a lot.
4,Great introduction,"A terrific introduction to 8 basic trend patterns, coupled with repetitive exercises forcing the reader to figure it out him/herself. A very few times I disagreed with the unnamed authors' solutions -- I think they miss better, stronger patterns. Also the book implies that if you read and work your way through you will be able to go out and trade successfully. I suspect that's not the case.Excellent presentation and exercises. Cheap. A great buy and well worth the few hours it takes to work completely through. I am a somewhat experienced trader and I learned a lot."
2,Not what I expected,The pages have big pictures with graphs and the few words on the page do not convey much. This was a waste of my money. The good thing is that I only spent just over $8 plus shipping.
4,"Simple, Quick & Fun",This book teaches you the basic chart patterns used by every TA. It provides you with a space to practice and you can read this book in two seatings. This book is a perfect starting point for anyone interested in learning technical analysis. You will enjoy this purchase. Have fun and trade smart!
1,A waste of money.,The book uses over 150 pages to explain how to draw a trend line on a bar chart. Then it gives Charles Dow credit for being the first person to publish a stock charting theory (the Chinese were charting rice trades long before Dow) and calls Leonardo Pisano Bogollo (who is renamed Leonardo Fibonacci) a crank. The book explains stop loss orders without explaining how to prevent being stopped out on every trade. The book ends with the usual head-and-shoulders and double-top formations. Go to [...] and learn everything this book has to offer and more.
5,great book. To the point.,"This book has already helped me earn $ and it was simple and easy to understand. Best stock book Ive read yet.This book basically shows you real life examples of stock charts and shows you what to do next when you see certain patterns. The writing is larger, the concepts are clear and easy, even for a beginner without any finance background.Its design: show a real life stock chart/show or explain pattern/show you what to do next, then ask you to do a few examples.A good starter book."
5,Super Book for New Traders,"You could blow through this in a couple days while working the simple exercises. This is for newbies only; shows how to draw trend lines, etc... it is a work book really that reinforces very effectively. You may learn something even if you are a seasoned pro."
2,Weakest of the three,I found this to be the weakest by far of the three SSfB CDs. I recommend either Vol 1 or 2 (four stars) before this volume.
5,YAHYAH,"Shirley Temple - America's Sweetheart Collection, Vol. 1 (Heidi / Curly Top / Little Miss Broadway)I loved it."
3,Captain January,"Great old movie from the 1930's - Heartwarming for the entire family,Warm story, great scenes and bit of history.Tim Harrison"
5,30's Childstar,"This is a three-box set containing Shirley Temple's Captain January(1936), Just Around the Corner(1938), and Susannah of the Mounties(1939).Each movie has the original black & white as well as a colorized version. There are subtitles in English and Spanish.Also included is the trailer for Susannah of the Mounties along with two Shirley Temple newsreels(Stage dedication to Will Rogers and A pony for Shirley's 8th birthday).A nice collection for fans of Shirley Temple."
5,Shirley Temple DVD'S,Shirley Temple DVD'S are wonderful for any age. She is a delight and I am well pleased with my purchase.
3,"Good songs, but...","Steve has had some good solo hits but none on the level of his hits with Journey. I don't know him personally, but his actions make him look like a prima donna. He came out and said that ""he never felt like part of the band"" but he was the one that went solo and basically forced Ross Valory and Steve Smith out of the group. He also changed the scarab theme and proposed name ""Freedom"" to that goofy ""Raised on Radio"" album. Sorry Steve, but you could have had it made if your ego hadn't gotten in the way (see Dennis DeYoung)."
3,Worth Having,"I love Steve Perry's voice. I think he is truly the greatest male singer of all time. I love his solo album ""Street Talk"". Included on this CD are those songs. In addition, there are some new ones. It took me awhile to warm up to them, but I have. They are different, but good in their own right. This a worthwhile CD for Steve Perry fans to have in their collection."
2,light and fluffy,this book is very light on technique you can find the exact same thing on the net I wouldnt bother unless you no nothing about photo shop
5,I thought this book was EXCELLENT. Easy to Read!,"I get bored easy, and this book kept my interest (finished it in two days). I like the way important information was presented in tables--easy to use as a reference. If you can't afford to take the Lotus Classes on Domino/Web....get this book! Also, after reviewing the Lotus sampe exams, I would recommend this book as a study guide. NUMEROUS typos in this book (but I can learn to live with that). Wish it was out in R4.6!"
3,review for z1300 printer,"I am quite satisfied with the performance of this printer. Print quality is ok in the normal mode but not in the quick mode. I previously owned an Hp printer of the same price range and the HP printer produced a better print quality in the quick mode. Also, it would be nice if Lexmark has also provided a black ink cartridge in the package."
3,Lexmark Inkjet 20A0000 is OK,"Have purchased two of these and they work. Don't buy one if you want a good, general purpose printer but do buy one if you want to print documents. The two I have bought serve well as auxiliary printers for in-office printing. Tough stuff is sent on to a higher cost printer. OK on cartridges, text printing is good."
2,no black ink,the printer was well priced and when i received i found out why. no black ink cartridge. amazon did not state this in the product description. the black ink was almost the cost of the printer. i do not recommend this printer.Lexmark Inkjet Printers (20A0000)
3,exceptional value,"A printer fo the price of an ink cartridge? it didnt come with a black ink cartridge and it doesn't need one, it fits in my vehicle perfectly because of its small size."
5,Wow brutal,"This might be my favorite Mortician CD, I think most of these songs sound better here recorded live than they do in the studio. I have never seen Mortician live before but from the way they sound on this disc it sounds like they are incomprehendibly brutal. I like Will Rahmer's introductions before the songs he is hilarious and truly brutal. If you don't like Mortician, you dont like brutal death metal. If you like truly brutal death metal than buy this disc it will shred your mind in half. Note: this cd is not for softcore death metal fans, casual death metal fans, or posers. Hail Mortician!!"
3,Excellent live album,"This is the first Mortician album that I've heard. For those of you looking to check these guys out, let me just say this; MINIMALISTIC DEATH METAL..!Finally! zombie massacre features almost 40 tracks (sometimes, the same twice but at different concerts)of less than 2 minute songs which start out with samples of obscure horror movies or the vocalist making some funny remarks. The live sound is suprisingly good (probably better than the studio albums, as death metal usually sounds better in concert than in the studio). This is pretty good and these guys actually have a fairly original sound. Best songs, the driller killer, drilling for brains, martin the vampire, worms, the crazies, and silent night, deadly night."
1,Your F&^%ing kidding right?,"This has to be a joke, no band could possibly be this terrible and still have a roving group of intellectually void rejects known as fans. And whats with the billy badass ""i'm trying to be intimidating but really i could get my ass handed to me by a 12 year old"" stereotypical cover that looks like an abortion. Come on face the facts people, these guys both suck and blow, they have no good songs i mean how the hell do they even get gigs, god i f%$#ing hate this ""band""."
2,Tribeca Open Toe Pump,"This shoes are dissappointing. My foot slides down at the Toe and it is not very comfortable. I love the Colour and the style, however, I will not be able to wear them too often."
3,Easy-to-use grill,"This grill is a mixed blessing. It seems to cook food even and well, without generating the flare ups consistent with my previous grilling experiences. There are some negatives. First, the instructions that come with the grill are horrendous; strictly picture-based, with no clear guiding text to delineate anything. Second, the construction of the grill seems somewhat questionable (e.g. I have a loose hubcap that precariously holds one of the large wheels in place). Finally, I'm not a big fan of the igniter switches being on right-hand side shelf of the unit."
2,Not Weber Quality - Poor heat retention.,"Note that almost all the people who liked the Weber Spirit were upgrading from a Char Broil. If you have ever used a good grill you will not think much of this one. It does heat up quickly, it also cools down quickly. It dropped from 375 to 150 in the time it takes to turn and season a steak. It would not heat back up unless you used all three burners at full heat. That is not something you want to do while your food is on the grill. The grates are very thin steel and there is nothing in there to hold the heat. Weber used to stand for quality. I'm surprised they would put their name on this poor quality product."
4,Just Desserts!,"A funny love story, with an excellent supporting cast. Our hero (Brian White) has to chose between his new job (and amorous employer) and a budding new romance (Kim Fields). Very easy to watch and enjoyable."
4,Brian White :-),"This was a pretty good movie. Brian White was something else in here. It kind of reminded me of ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"" Older woman, younger man. His boss should have been on the cover with him and Kim Fields."
4,Dang; people. There is a way to give a REVIEW without giving the whole movie away,"The storyline (and practically the whole story) has already been given in some of the previous reviews, so I will keep this short.If you are looking for Romance, Humor, a bit of Drama and a little bit of heart, then get this movie. It is certainly one to have in your collection.Brian White had me cracking up in some of the scenes when he got happy over something.It was a joy watching him and Kim Fields hit it off. Their chemistry was so warm, I was almost convinced they were a real-life couple."
5,an oassis,"Issues + Options is a beautiful collection of songs about our human condition. Phil Roy not only writes about life in a way which we can all relate, his soulful voice makes it easy to connect. Sometimes soaring, sometimes sensitive, Phil Roy sings from his heart. This album is a gem, truly an oassis in what can be a wasteland of popular music. Surrounded by excellent musicians, Phil Roy has made an exceptional record of comtemporary songs, a must for real music lovers."
5,I'm hard to please......,"I paint to this CD all the time. An incredible follow up to ""grouchyfriendly"". It's like an all time greatest hits album but we have never heard any of the songs. It flows from romantic to tragic to humorous with ease and sophistication. I am HIGHLY selective about the music I listen to and I most definately recommend this CD. It truly is special. (personal favorite song: ""God is not Sleeping""... an absolute masterpiece.)"
1,Aweful beep,"If you are musical, you probably won't like the electronic sound this machine makes. I am going for a traditional metronome. While more expensive, how many metronomes does one buy in a lifetime?"
1,Quitter,"I purchased the Metronome for running training. It's size and range of tempos were the features that appealed to the people who recommended it to me. I used it 3 times, then the volume stopped working. It was barely audible and unable to be adjusted, which made it useless for my purposes. I tried having the battery changed, but that did not work either. Very disappointing."
5,Works as Promised,This product is light and easy to carry. I use it to keep a tempo when running. It seems durable as I have dropped it on a couple of runs and it keeps working.
4,small and convenient,"Inexpensive,small and convenient to clip to something so it won't fall and break on the floor. Adjustable sound is a nice feature and the price was right."
5,Perfectly meets my need!,I use it to pace my running cadence and it is ideal for this purpose. It is small and has a clip on the back which makes it easy to secure to any area of clothing. There is a volume control which allows you to make the tone louder or softer. Good price and good quality. Only suggestion back to retailer is to take the batteries out before sending; it was beeping in the post office and I was advised they had talked with the city's SWAT/bomb squad about it.
5,Chi Running essential,I used this for Chi Running. It works great and the options make it very adaptable to different conditions.
3,It does what it is supposed to do.,"This is a small, light weight metronome with easy to understand functions. I was able to figure out all that it is capable of doing within a few minutes. The sound is plenty loud, too. I bought this for a running workshop that I attended and 1 was sufficient enough for our group of 20 people abreast to hear clearly. I would have given this product more stars if it had been a little cheaper and if it had other sound options other than just a high pitch chirp. A clicking sound that is not so annoying would be nice. This thing does what it is supposed to do even though it is typical cheap plastic. Also, if you toss it in your bag and then toss your bag on the floor, be prepared to have to dig through the bag immediately because the on button has a hair trigger. This is a tool for running drills to dial in your cadence but personally I would not want to run for a half hour with it chirping. Will you have buyer's remorse for getting this one over another one? Doubtful."
3,Good for cost,This is a decent metronome at the price. The only problem I had is it doesn't have a headphone jack as claimed and would be exceptionally annoying to others around you. I recommend you turn the volume way down if you plan to use this in a group.
2,I paid too much for this simple device,Device is easy to use. I paid $27 for the device which I found later can be bought for less than $14.
2,Not worth the price.,"It works fine but is over-priced for what you get. It's like a little toy and doesn't look like it would last long. If I was selling this, I would ask for $5 max. Certainly not $20 or more. If you're using it for running, it might be just what you're looking for but again, overpriced. Don't buy it especially if you need it for a musical instrument. It's not very loud and you probably won't be able to hear it over the music."
4,great for running,I like the fact that it's a clip-on. I can take it with me running. And it's easy to adjust for a quicker or slower pace.
3,Great melodies!,"Cock Robin was one of the best kept secrets in the 80's. I was living in Mexico City and it was hard to find them, I had a mixed tape with some of their tunes. At that time they sounded strong, fresh and tight. I just listened to them again and haven't lost any of the above"
1,psychedelic puff !,I lived through the psychedelic 60's. The special effects were like other movies of that era. I did not care for it then and I don't care for it now. The bodies become fuzzy and shaded in red.Plus the story line is more like a short story than a novel. It lacks substance. I have more than a dozen of Franco's movies and I have to rate this as last. That being said I do like his female leads and the DVD is loaded with extras.
4,"Moving, lyrical film","This is the rarest of films -- action and violence are present, certainly -- yet, due to the vulnerability of the protagonist, a young boy, the viewer is ""brought into"" the film in a way that is impossible with the macho, untouchable action heroes that frequently litter such films. The tension and suspense is offset by a lyricism also not present in most ""action"" films. Ultimately, this is a beautiful, life-affirming film wrapped up in the guise of an action film. A unique film -- don't miss it."
5,The BEST product for a scaly scalp!,"This shampoo is wonderful! It's the best product I've found for controlling seborrheic dermatitis (scaly scalp). Here's what I like:* It doesn't contain tar, which is smelly and unpleasant to use, and also has safety issues. In Ionil Plus, the active agent is salicylic acid.* It removes all scaling and calms the itching of dermatitis* The shampoo smells wonderful (and your hair will, too)* It rinses clean, leaving hair and scalp feeling fresh and clean* You don't need a separate conditioner - it's included in the shampoo* It's gentle enough for daily useI can't say enough good things about Ionis Plus. It's the only shampoo I use, or need."
2,lol,"Either that, or Trotsky COINED THE TERM while working at his think-tank, to produce divisiveness and tear down existing structures FOR HIS OWN ENDS, and I guess the proof is in the pudding. The term ""revisionsim"" was made for the reviewers here. Please, start to THINK, THINK, THINK. People make this stuff up---then when their plan goes into operation, you say they were visionaries. LOL. Only dependent populations don't understand how this works!!!"
1,Dont Waste Your Money....,"This 3 DVD set is not worth buying or even watching. While the original films were entertaining they have been transferred to disk in a way that renders the colors unrealistic and produces a letter-box effect on all four sides reducing the screen size significantly. I bought this set to save money but what is on the 3 disks is barely watchable. You don't get any special features for any of the movies. Just play and scene selection. To add insult to injury, the disks broke loose in transit and rattled around inside the case scratching each disk significantly. Bottom line, spend your money elsewhere."
5,Very good,I didn't except receive the new dvds.But they are brand new and good price. Very good.I'll come back agagin
3,its exactly the same...,as the 1st and 2nd on N64.= You just have more guys and a little better graphics
2,Tony Hawk has reached a new low,"Unfortunately, I was one of those idiots who bought Gamecube over PS2. I bought SSB:M, Rogue Leader, THPS3, Spy Hunter, and Cel Damage. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is my target now. This game is patheticly easy. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 is harder than this trash. THPS3 has a horrible soundtrack too (THPS2's is the best). The game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2X for Xbox is much better. The graphics of this Tony Hawk are incredible though. The levels are quite detailed too. THPS1 had its way of not telling you all the specials and moves like this one does. This game has moves where you go underground. Wait a second! How in the world do you skateboard underground?!?!?!? I have one question for Neversoft; Why do you still call it Tony Hawk's? Nobody even plays as Tony Hawk! This is a waste of money unless you only care about the graphics. If you don't have a N64 then get one and get THPS1 and you will know what I mean by the skill level difference."
4,Fun game even if I'm not the target audience...,"I got this game a little while ago and while I've never done any skateboarding in my life (I'm 29). This game is pretty fun to play. Lots of different options and hours upon hours of play if you don't use any cheat menus. It takes a little while to learn all the tricks but there is a tutorial which is really helpful. I'm generally big into the sports games and figured I'd give this one a try and I'm glad I did. The game makes for good times, good times indeed my friend."
4,Too Easy In My Opinion,"I bought THPS3 shortly after Christmas and at first i was thrilled by what this game gave me to play. Going back to the goal based missions for unlocking levels is good after in THPS2 when you had to earn money and then buy levels and upgrades for your skater. The graphics are great, much better than on the PS2. There are not many moves you can perform though. This game didn't take me long to beat either even though i did not have a lot of Tony Hawk experience beforehand. The creating of skaters and parks is great too. However, this game has little replay value. The multi-player modes are not good at all and the soundtrack will quickly get annoying. The goals are too easy and the 3 competition levels are hard and annoying and frustrating because you want to move on to the next level. This is a great game. However, rental is probably the answer because you will most likely beat it before you must take it back."
5,Good game,"Tony hawk 3 has set the standard for skateboarding games. This game that has a great comination of graphics,moves,and 2 player action. You can pick out of 12 different pro skaters to skate with,along with 13 different levels.This game is made for childrenbetween the age of 11-14. Tony Hawk 3 is a game that every gamecube owner should have."
2,Uhh,This game was ok but there isn't really anything new compared to the earlier ones. Except for that there is a skateboard shop and a bunch of new stuff but the gameplay is still the same. tony Hawk 4 is the best one though.
3,ok game,"The graphics are great and the pepole look rilly real. And the beast part about the game is that you can make girl skaters, but you can't make there... size thats what gives this game 3 stares you can't say how big you won't there...!"
2,Was hoping for a lot more...,"I was expecting a lot more from the GameCube version of THPS 3. It looks the same as PS2, but the frame rate is worse. And in split screen mode, the frame rate is horrible. The levels are really small, although this was a problem with the PS2 version too. It feels like that kept them small so they could do a PS version of the game and use the same levels."
2,ps2 is waaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy better,THere are a lot of things y ps2's version is better. Thhe framework for Gamecube is really slow and I did not like this edition of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2. But do me a favor. Write something in that box I will put below.Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 has excellent_________-thanksalan Y.
4,Carried Away,"Michael Phillips' presents an invitation at the beginning of this epic, an invitation to spend time with his book, to enjoy it. I accepted the invitation with a slight sense of skepticism--I'm often frustrated by the mediocre quality of Christian fiction, and this was the first Phillips' book I'd attempted...But I was soon carried away! Swept into a past, rich with characters, description, and historical relevance. The writing was superlative, the story compelling, and the mood vibrant with color and emotion. I was reminded more than once of the emotions and awe I sensed while reading ""The Clan of the Cave Bear."" I'm overjoyed to see a well-written novel of this grandeur published by Bethany House. Sure, this novel will be too long for some readers, too involved for some thrill-seekers, but my hats off to author and publisher for presenting quality literature for those willing to invest their time...It was worth it! Where's book two?"
3,Take the bad with the good,"I was very intrigued by the author's rendition of the history of Scotland. The way that the kernels of history were expressed as portraits of its people was impressive. I would re-read the book to absorb more of the history. But I wasn't all that interested in the alternating story of Andrew. I didn't care enough about him as a character. I like the idea of contrasting the ancient with the modern, but the modern story seemed too flat to me.This was my first stab at historical fiction, and I was pleasantly surprised. If you are interested in Scottish history told with imagination, you will probably enjoy this book."
3,religious bias,"I enjoyed the history found in this book as well as the story's mystery. However, I was take aback when I reached the last 100 pages and discovered what I presume to be the author's Christian bias and what I see as ignorance in describing the ancient Celtic religion even stating 'the druids conducted Satin's business.' I didn't realize when I purchased the book that the author was steeped in Christian mythology but rather expected an unbiased approach history and to ancient religions."
4,Review from ESL teacher,"The book is broken up into small (~3 page) chapters for each sound, forty chapters in all. Each chapter gives a description on how to form the sound, approximately twenty words with the sound, comparison words with similar sounds, practice sentences, phrasing and intonation exercises, and a review dialogue section. Each lesson takes twenty to thirty minutes to teach to a small class of ten or less.The exercises are very well designed and practical for a class setting. My students make significant improvement with each lesson. The only thing I find lacking is a section on which sounds are typically difficult for different language backgrounds."
4,Dubble oh spoof,"One of the better spy spoofs to emerge from the 60's. Ok, Bond is great, and he'll always be #1, but Flint was a close second. I remember seeing this on TV every now and then when I was a kid in the 70's. I always enjoyed it. Basically our man flint has to save the world from evil (not really that evil, more like miss guided) scientists. Flint reluctantly accepts the mission, on his own terms. The plot was far fetched, the sets outrageous, the costumes wild, that cool swinging music and silly dialog all add up to a great campy film. The great James Coburn was perfect as Flint. (We will miss him)If you want to know where Austin Powers got most of mojo from look here first. I only wish there would have been a few more Flint movies. I'm sure they would have been as mush fun as the two that were made. If you enjoy 60's spy films, and don't take life too seriously you'll enjoy this...and you'll get the ""in-between"" jokes in the Austin Powers movies."
4,Austin Power's favorite movie,This is a great spoof of the spy movies of the day.James Corburn is so cool in this film you could hang a side of beef in him.
4,Great 60's nostalgia,"A fun couple of movies. Definitely themed for the 60's mentality, but still a lot of very enjoyable.The TV show pilot is nice as an item to complete the Flint collection, but is a terrible movie in it's own right. No wonder a series never happened."
5,A true classic!,"If you like James Bond (real ""Sean Connery"" Bond that is), then you will love Flint! James Coburn is smooth, funny and is really the American version of 007."
3,"I LOVE this flick but come on, 4 or 5 stars is crazy!","I first saw this film when it first came out and I was in fifth grade. To a ten year old boy Flint was one of the coolest guys on Earth and months after I saw the movie I was still trying to figure out how to turn the girls in my class into ""pleasure units."" Lucky for all of us, I never succeeded.Both Flint movies are a cornucopia of camp and to really enjoy them you have to turn your brain down a few notches and turn up your suspension of disbelief to the max. Just enjoy the silly, sexy adventures of our improbable hero.Now about all those stars in some other reviews. To me a five-star movie is Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz, Days of Heaven, The Conversation, Lolita--perfect of near perfect examples of cinematic art. As amusing as Our Man Flint is, it falls far short of such glory.Still, this is a fun flick worth a look."
3,Not bad for when it was made,The movie is not bad for when it was made. The special effects are pathetic by today's standards. They were probably not very good even in 1966. Coburn and Cobb are pretty good. Basically just a nice diversion.
4,Dated but still enjoyable Bond satire,"Who better than James Coburn to take the air out of James Bond? This satire of the Bond films (and spy genre in general) is a bit dated, but still a whole lot of fun. What' surprising is that the film lend itself to a sequel (In Like Flint).The marvelous Lee J. Cobb plays Flint's befuddled ""M"" and the cast is obiviously having loads of fun. Is it a classic on the level of North By Northwest? Not exactly but it's fun nevertheless."
5,Super Cool,"as a young boy growing up in during the 1960s, Our Man Flint was and still is, one of my favorite spy satire films of that era."
4,Screen tests,"There must be two different versions of this ultimate Flint collection. My new copy only has screen test for Deanna Lund on the third disc and none of the others. And then on the trailers it has, Our Man FlintIn Like FlintThe ChairmanThe Quiller MemorandumDeadfallPeeperThe Magus, but no beyond the Valley of the dolls. So that tells me that there are two different special features versions in this ultimate collection. When I went to look online I did not find the same collection accept at Barnes & Noble's. Meaning there exact list mirrors mine."
4,Love this movie,"I am a die hard Flint Fan. I have watched the movie so many times. It is great to have them on DVD and on Widescreen format. It is so much better than my VHS versions.The one thing that I need to make note. And I have sent Amazon a note. On the descriptions of the package, it states that the 3rd disk contains Screen Tests. I could not find them. It was one of the main reasons I bought the collection. Am I missing it somewhere??? I see the1.TV Movie- Dead On Target2.Our Man Flint - Special Features******Spy-er-ama******A Gentleman's Game******Spy Style******The Perfect Bouillabaisse******Our Man Flint - Extended Trailer3.In Like Flint - Special Features******The Musician's Magician******Future Perfect******Spy School******Spy Vogue******Feminine Wiles******In Like Flint -Puerto Rico Premiere******Screen Test - Deanne Lund******""Take It Off""4. Trailers"
1,the memories of this were better,"Bought this based on memories of watching this as a kid. Sadly, it's pretty humorless despite the gadgets, Lee J. Cobb, James Coburn and various babes.I was shocked at how hokey the premise was to each movie and the sets looked tacky bar maybe Flint's pad.The extra DVD has some attempted made-for-TV Flint pilot movie that never made the air (I believe and it shows!). The rest are just plain filler. I expected way more in-depth interviews and maybe some sort of explanation of whys and hows of parodying the James Bond flicks.Oh well, goes to show that memories are often better than the real thing.Actually, I'd sooner have bought a DVD of James Coburn's ""Speak Lark"" TV ads he did in Japan. Now those are deadpan funny."
2,This is a James Coburn film?,"To summarize this film well, I would just have to say that it is just one of the other thousands of James Bond spoofs that are out there. I think James Coburn must have had a bad movie agent or something, he is usually in very good roles, but this one is just strange. The plot is totally mixed up, and tries to make fun of Ian Fleming's SPECTRE orginazation, calling it GALAXY. It is funny at some points, but often not."
1,Just plain dumb,"It was compared to a Bond movie. No way. Poor acting, poor plots. Waste of time and money."
4,In Like Flint is Great!,"Ok, if you like '60's camp spy spoof films this collecion is for you! In fact it's the best. The plot is thin, but who watches that. We all know we watch for the clothes, the sets, and that fabulous 60's retro feel when the world was in parrel and only one man could save us. How can you discount James Coburn saving us from feminists who brain wash housewives using bonnet style hair dryers, it's fantastic! Run run run and watch this collection!!"
3,"[Three and-a-half stars] Take that, James Bond!","James Coburn fans will love! The suave,debonaire Flint parodies that unpercrustBrit superspy in a very fine film! Leo KJacob (Lee J Cobb), who was outstandingin Clint Eastwood's Coogan's Bluff co-stars! Simply put - very good and funny!Pick Up On It!"
2,"I hate to rain on the parade, but...","When it first came out in the sixties, I thought Flint was really cool. I watched it in 2008, and it turns out that my memory of how cool the film was just shows how little I knew in the sixties, either about cool or about movies. The special effects are primative, the plot tedious, and the acting over. All that remains is James Coburn, who really is cool. But Coburn has been in much better films than this. Watch The Magnificent Seven instead."
5,EXCELLENT FLINT,"Don't know why I waited sooooo long to get this series. These two movies shaped my childhood and actually tought me to not only like the way women look, but to like the way they think as well.I was a slim guy growing up just like Flint, so I also cultivated the idea of not competing with women from him. What do you know, it actually worked! Not trying to be chauvinistic but the Flint, Bond and Matt Helm movies were all I had to use as a reference of what kind of man I wanted to eventually be. I think I chose the right guy (Flint).I know I didn't really say much about the movies themselves, I'll leave that to the other reviewers. But I am trying to let it be known how much I think the Flint films can have an affect on the inquisitive mind of a growing young man for the better. That's what good movies are supposed to do (as well as entertain). These movies have entertainment in spades!"
5,Our Man Flint & In Like Flint,"If you like older spy movie spoofs and secret agent gadgets and James Coburn and pretty girls you will like these 2 movies.It has action, cool gadgets, karate, cool & clever escapes and lots of humor.He does stuff that Bond never did.These movies were a big hit back in the 60's and I think they still hold up today. James Coburn is terrific as Derek Flint a self styled, state of the art secret agent. He is smooth as silk. He relaxes by stopping his heart and his girls are absolutely gorgeous. He is a martial arts champion, teaches ballet and fencing and speaks 7 different languages. He can also talk to Dolphins. Thanks for letting me review these films.Bill G."
4,FDK not Sanyo,"Brand is FDK not Sanyo. We had a previous FDK, it lasted a little less than the original Snuza brand in the Snuza Halo baby monitor (original lasted about 2 months). I ordered this to see if a Sanyo battery lasted longer but the seller provided an FDK. The 2nd FDK only lasted between 2 and 3 weeks. The seller replaced free (FDK again). We had to order another battery in the interm and this time I ordered a Snuza brand battery. We will use this replacement FDK when the Snuza battery dies. Although frustrating that the battery is not a Sanyo as shown in the picture, I am happy with the seller since they replaced the battery free. If we get 6 weeks out of it in combination with the 2 to 3 out of the first one then I will have got my money's worth."
3,Average Horner,"I am proud to be the first person to review this score from the master James Horner. I don't like the movie Cocoon,the Return at all,and i didn't even remembered anything about the music of this film,but as i am a Horner fan i decided to buy this cd.It was not disapointing,but it is shurely not the best of Horner.It's the typical sunday afternoon family film score!If you see what i mean... I have about 12 scores of Horner,and this is probably the one i like less.But this is still HORNER,so it's...GOOD!!"
4,STINGRAY [the forgotten Cocker classic],"Stingray was the last album Joe Cocker ever released for A&M Records in April of 1976. This much overlooked album[which A&M failed to promote adequately]ranks as a favorite among his musical peers. Joe turns in some unbelievable vocal performances on such tunes as ""The Jealous Kind"", ""A Song For You"", ""She is My Lady"" and ""The Worrier""[which Features Eric Clapton on guitar]. The soulful rhythm section is anchored by Joe's then backup band Stuff with lead guitarist Eric Gale providing flawless guitar solo's throughout. Great backup vocals are provided by Patti Austin, Deniece Williams and Bonnie Bramlet. The late Peter Tosh makes a cameo as well on the Dylan tune ""The Man in Me"". If you like Joe Cocker this is a must have import[never released domestically]which is very reasonably priced. It's been said by a prior review of this album many years ago by James Chrispell""Stingray is full of gems worth seeking out""."
1,"Ordered, Paid, Never received!!!",I ordered this item 3 or 4 weeks ago and have never received it. I went to cancel the order and my cancellation was refused. DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM... YOU WONT GET IT.
1,Jack without his usual bag of tricks,"Jack Nicholson in this shameless attempt at comedy plays a dog trainer of all professions who gets involved with an oprea singer who is caught up in the underworld of crime. Critcally embarssing to Nicohlson's carrer but jack has done much better to cover this mistake. A minor film with good talent gone to waste, a film way below par considering the re-teaming of director Bob Rafelson & Nicholson from ""FIVE EASY PIECES"""
4,One of Kris's best.,"A good movie with a good script and directing. As cop shows go, I liked it as well as any I've seen and better than most."
4,A must for any Ärzte fan,"This is their 3rd cd after Uns Ghets prima. It is a good cd, also funny. If you can speak/understand german than buy this. I think songs from this cd were put on 18 ab. because of the content. But it has a great sound. simply put, just buy it."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I rarely do reviews, but I was particularly disappointed in this knife. I bought it to replace my ex-girlfriend's that was fantastic and purchased in Taiwan.This knife isn't flat on the bottom edge making dicing and chopping far harder than it should be. Worse yet is that it's not very sharp! I had an easier time thin-slicing vegetables with my meat cleaver...It's a good size and well balanced. It works. It just doesn't work as well as it should for the price."
5,Truth Woven From the Lies,"We try to do it all, be all things to all people, be all places at all times.We are women, we are capable and we are tired.Tracie Peterson, Allison Bottke and Dianne O'Brien tackle the statement 'I can do it all' with truth and grace in this book.With candor and vulnerability they share stories from their own journeys and guide us on ours. Fourteen chapters, fourteen lies we try to live and always fail. For it is the truth of the Bible that will break the lies. Then we learn it is only through Christ who strengthens us that we can do all things.This book is an excellent resource for women's Bible studies, retreats and individual growth and reflection. Woven through the pages is truth, beauty and the grace of the God who CAN do it all. Read the book. You will see yourself on the pages. You will also find mercy and freedom on every page."
3,I Can't Do It All,"My Bible study group used this over the period of a year to discuss our own personal growth. We enjoyed the many topics and ideas in the book and I really feel it is an excellent discussion starter to explore why we women believe the lies society and our own filters hand us. As a group, each of us grew through using this as a guide. It created so much discussion that we decided to just stick with it for the entire year. I think I personally learned more using it in a group format.[...]Angie"
5,babyphat girl,i cannot believe it! kimora has done it again. i am a long wearer and lover of bangles. these gold babypaht bangles are a must have for anyone claiming to be a true babyphat wearer. if they don't hate me already the will once they see these bangles marvelously complimenting the rest of my babyphat out fits and handbags. please believe me!
3,"A Real Rhapsody, Like Maborosi - A Specialized Choice","This movie reminds me a lot of Maborosi: slow, beautiful, true ring to it for its conclusion.If you want action, don't watch this movie. The actors seemed a little stiff all through the feature. And come on, no teenager stays with Grandma to help her remember her brothers and sisters! A few scenes were a little fake like that.If you like Maborosi, you will like this movie."
3,"Visually beautiful, but still falls short","Akira Kurosawa's film addressing the impact of the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki from the perspective of nearly 40 years after the fact lacks the dramatic intensity of his earlier films. There are touches of the old Kurosawa, but for the most part, the dialog is stilted and the storyline flat. The finest performance comes from Sachiko Murase, who plays the elderly grandmother who survived the attack and tries to convey to her grandchildren a sense of how it changed lives.While the scenes of the Japanese countryside are visually beautiful, and there is a very moving scene shot at the Nagasaki memorial, this film doesn't go far enough in its examination of the moral issues involved in the nuclear attack and the lasting consequences of it. Many questions were raised, but few answers given. The slightly surreal ending seems contrived, especially in comparison to the slow, almost plodding pace of the rest of the film."
5,informative and interesting series,"Popular Mechanics for Kids: Gators and Dragons and Other Wild BeastsMy 5 year old boy loves these programs. The first two were so enjoyed I bought the rest of the series.This was a series on tv at one time, apparently. I hope they package the rest of the programs because the show is fab.Each dvd has 4 episodes that are somewhat related. The 2 kid hosts explore different aspects of each subject.Some are surprising but all are interesting and informative."
2,Pretty but not practical,"The jar is attractive and has a nice weight. But it is not microwavable (probably because honey gets VERY hot and would break the glass.) The dripper doesn't go to the bottom of the jar so a spatula has to be used to get all the honey out. It's messy. After a few uses honey is stuck on the sides of the glass inside, and it doesn't look good. I'm disappointed."
2,Good on paper,Aesthetically it is very pleasant but it doesn't seal well and honey crystallizes unless used within a couple of weeks. It will become a flower vase.
2,Beautiful But Not Functional,"I love the look of this honey jar, but it's not functional at all. Honey quickly gathers around the edges and spills over making the top very sticky which in turn pulls the rubber seal off. The whole thing is just a mess."
3,Form or Funtion,"Honey isn't my favorite food to work with, this product performs well but it is much easier to use honey straight from original container."
3,Mug is exactly what I wanted; however...,I ordered three and received only one. I was charged for three. Too much hassle to go through to get a credit or the other two mugs...
3,Kate Matrtinelli is not Playing the Fool,"I like the Martinelli series. The character is strong and nuanced and the police team work interesting. This time it was difficult to finish the book for some reason, the story never grabbed me. However the main character and his living out of a very unique spiritual practice - that of being the Fool was extremely interesting as is the focus on St. Francis. However the ultimate ending of the story and who did it and why was such a sharp contrast that I was dissatisfied.The ending felt slapped on to what King was more interested in exploring, the development of a Fool who plays for Kings and paupers. Worth the read for that exploration."
3,Did I miss something?,"Throughout this book, I felt like I'd missed something. Since I bought four books together, I kept double-checking that I wasn't reading them out of order. That point aside, the story is a very good one and I felt really connected to the characters in this book. I would give it a better rating, except that I think that the first and third books are better."
1,Brilliant to embarrassing within 6 songs,"Re-release of Artillery's Demo tapes on CD. Total of 4 demo tapes included. Tracks 2 and 3 are from the 1989 demo for the ""By Inheritence"" LP and these songs absolutely crank!! Much heavier sound than appeared on the final CD (which was ok). Heaps of energy and trademark insanely heavy and fast riffs with powerful vocals. Tracks 4 and 5 are from the 1985 demo for the ""Fear of Tomorrow"" LP. These pretty much sound the same as the LP.The next 8 songs are from demo's from 1984 with their first vocalist. As you'd expect they are pretty rough and immature. The vocals are just plain funny. The music however, shows how these guys were right up there with your Metallica's and Slayer's and way ahead of most other bands of the era.It was a disappointment that there were no demo's for 1987's classic ""Terror Squad"", which you should pickup without delay. Also, perhaps get their new CD ""B.A.C.K"". Riffs, Riffs, Riffs....insane."
3,"good collection, but overlap","While a good collection, there is a high degree of overlap with other collections out there (eg. Six Degrees' Arabian Travels Vo1. I)."
2,More of a chaise lounge really,"A lot of reviewers seemed to really love this CD, and perhaps you will too. As for me, I found it somewhat dull and without the enchanting and enticing melodies that I associate with North African music. Most of the cuts seem to wander listlessly around as if they were searching for, and never quite finding, their groove. Speaking of grooves, I found Putumayo's ""Arab Groove"" much better."
3,"Good, but wish there was more included that was ACTUALLY from the the Middle east/North Africa","I really love the Putumayo series, they generally have wonderful compilations, and generally put together quite a nice set of music for the region they are representing with thier CD compilations. I like the fact that when you buy a CD, part of it goes to charity.I liked many of the tracks on this CD, the problem is, its called Sahara Lounge, and a lot of the tracks are not even from the Sahara region. There are tracks from the US as well as the UK. There are also many, many from Lebanon and a sampling from a few other middle eastern/north african contries, but for the most part there is nothing from Iraq, Iran, Israel, Syria, also north Africa which contains most of the Sahara region is very poorly represented.For the tracks that were put in, most of them are pretty good, and would make a nice backround for a hip middle eastern themed dinner, or music to play in an exotic lounge."
5,little known secret,This album is unknown to most people. It took me a while to find an album by them after hearing their stunning song Quiet Light off the Third Barramundi Sampler. I'm not sure if there is an album before this one but if anyone knows where I can find the album with Quiet Light on it I would be in your debt. This album has an ambient sound similar to most of the albums on Waveform records (one of my favorite record outfits for ambient music).This album is worth the price of admission for a journey into another world.I hope they put out a new album soon
4,Fun tribute album,"This is a fun tribute album, particularly for ABBA fans and fans of dance-pop. Highlights are ""Money, Money, Money"" by Madness (with more of rock edge), ""Mamma Mia"" by actress/singer Martine McCutcheon, ""I Know Him So Well"" by Steps, and ""Does Your Mother Know"" by defunct Irish pop group B*Witched. The songs are updated for the 90s but they fit so well in the present day they only affirm how timeless the music of ABBA is."
5,Samantha McVelia's best special review!,"Hi! I'm called Samantha McVelia! I have the cd of ABBAMANIA! I think that this cd is quite cooool!!! My mam likes Abba alot! So she has me liking it to! We think that the ABBAMANIA cd is great! But, sometimes when i listen to the ABBAMANIA cd then an Abba cd, i think that the people singing on the ABBAMANIA cd is better!"
2,Typical...,"What is it about the musical groups that cover Abba that suck all the life out of the songs? I actually really enjoy most of the artists on this album...when they are not butchering Abba. None of these singers have anything similar to the real vocal depth that Agnetha and Frida had, and there are boring dance mixes of already originally strong dance tracks. There ARE some decent 'tributes' on the album, but you may as well just pop in the real Abba: more enjoyment, less wishing for better production value."
1,REALLY BAD!,"Another really bad cold war movie! Sir Anthony Hopkins tries to speak American English but fails completely! And so do the other actors. The story line is ridiculous, as most of the cold war movies. However, this movie could be worth seeing. But you would need Cary Grant, James Stewart and Ingrid Bergman in the cast. A waste of time and money!"
1,don't bother renting this movie,This movie had a talented cast and director.It was partly filmed in Berlin at Tempelhof Airbase The book itself was wonderful but the movie just never took off. Dead meat. I was an extra in the movie. You can see me at the end when Campbell Scott enters the plane.A friend of mine had a speaking role as a Russian translator. Another friend is unrecognizable as a stewardess pacing near the runway in Berlin. It premiered in a small town in Berlin at a British movie theatre in Gatow.This was a champagne/tuxedo premiere. What a dud. Hard to believe with the cast/director but flops remain flops.Save your money on this one.
2,Not Exactly As Good As The Book,"This film gets 2 stars for good production only. Fans of the book will be grossly disappointed. Anthony Hopkins was grossly mis-cast. It stays too far from the book in order to be an ""acceptable"" movie and too much is lost and twisted in the conversion. Frankly, I'd think McEwan would have enough money that he wouldn't need to sell out this way.The characters have no chemistry with one another.The ending is ambiguous.For all the ""movie"" magic weaved in, it lacks drama.A mere phantom of the book. Skip it."
1,algebra book,"This book is great! Once you've completed elementary algebra, this should be your next step. A lot of people I know who've been out of school for a long time, if they don't take the basic courses first, fail college level math and have to come back to our teacher's class anyway."
3,Very used book.,I bought this book that said it was in good shape. However it came and it was written in and not well taken care of. I was shocked since all the other books I bought from amazon have been in excellent to new shape. This book should have been rated in a lesser state. Its still useable but I would have liked it to not have so much writing and some of the answers are filled iin and most are incorrect. Its just a messy book.
3,Intermediate Algebra,"I was to start by saying that the seller did specify that this was the instructor's edition of the text and the book was sent timely and in excellent condition. the problem I have is with the book itself. As the teacher's edition it doesn't not meet my needs for the class. The teacher's edition gives the answers but does not break down how they arrived at the solution. Therefore, I have to purchase another textbook.Thanks"
5,AJ Ohio,I recieved this book very quickly which was very important to me since I wanted to review it before the class started. I have ordered other books from other sources but have never recieved one this fast before. :)
1,Buckle won't work,"I like the looks of it, but once I tried wearing it the buckle would continue to open and the end would stick up/out. The little brackets used to hold down the end that is pulled through the buckle kept sliding as well, so it wouldn't stay put. I think I have to return it!"
5,A truly GREAT aviation documentary!,"This was one of the best documentaries that I've ever seen on the Blues. While other videos only concentrate on the flying scenes (don't worry, this has PLENTY of them) this video shows what the WHOLE team goes through to make the show work. Everything is covered, from the pilots, to ops and the techs who keep the planes in the air.So many people get on planes every day and watch planes fly... Yet they don't think about what it takes to keep those planes in the air! As a aviation professional, I enjoyed seeing credit go to the the men and women who keep the Blue Jets flying!"
3,A Self-Help Book for the Wardrobe Challenged,"I was looking for a book to help me discover what colors and styles would best flatter my body. This book covers more of the emotional issues and self-esteem issues that women have in choosing clothes. It's interesting, but more of a ""Self-help"" book than a practical wardrobe improvement."
4,Decent lock,"I've had this lock for a long time. I you can cinch the cable up nice and tight. It can be coiled up and it fits in my Camelbak pretty easy. It's long enough to go through 2 bikes, wheels and frame.The cable is probably easier to cut through that a chain style lock but, if they are determined to steal your bike there isn't much you can do."
1,Useless,"After purchasing bikes, we knew we would need a lock. I figured a lock that required a key would be more secure than a combination lock. Boy was I wrong.I owned this lock, and 2 bicycles for about 3 weeks. Now I own 1 bicycle and no lock.Only prevents the laziest of theives from stealing a bicycle. Would have been great had it served its purpose."
5,The 12 Essential Skills for Great Preaching,"Well please, I got just what they said. The book is well written, easy to apply-thanks."
3,I just bought this for $2,At a store in the mall. Is this version good quality? Does it have extras? Anything to justify this price?
4,Kraftwerk for infants,"""Lullaby"" is the best song on this disk and it sounds as though Kraftwerk may have listened to this when composing the beginning of ""Europe Endless"" from ""Trans-Europe Express"". It's a pleasant, dreamy sort of repetitive piece of music and I've fallen asleep to it myself a few times when I programmed my CD player to stop at the end of it and not go on to the rest of the CD. At 14 minutes, ""Lullaby"" gives you time to drift off into an electronically induced sleep. The other songs are also pleasant and fun with the major exception of ""Tic Toc"". ""Tic Toc"" has no melody and is exactly what the title suggests, an electronic version of a constant ""tic-toc"" clock sound that seems to go on forever. Maybe a baby would find this spellbinding but, I personally think you could play this to torture people. That's why I gave this CD 4 stars instead of 5."
3,A begining of a legacy,"Die Ärzte is a band that started out in Berlin, Germany. This happens to be their 1st LP. but has a demo out called Uns Gehts Prima which means we are fine. This cd is mostly soft nothing heavy, but as the years went by you can tell that their style has changed. In order to understand the lyrics you must speak german. Proficent prefrably. the hit song on their is probably Zu spat. some songs were banned in germany such as Claudia Hat' nen schaferhund. This band has about 16 other cds out. I never thought i would listen to german music but i do and i can speak german. if you are learning german i would suggest you listen to this cd because it uses alot of common phrases to help you with pronuciation. Die Ärzte ist die beste band der welt. for english Die Ärzte is the best band in the world."
5,Great ball,A great buy. My son wears soccer balls out like crazy and this ball has lasted the longest by far. Welll worth the money.
2,"Kiefer gives s solid performance, but....","Depsite his good performance, this is not enough to save the sloppy direction, weak production and the decpetion of the public through a cover art that is completely misleading."
4,Very amusing movie,Great to see Kiefer as a regular guy instead of a bad guy or tough guy. Loved the interaction between Kiefer's character Pally and Anthony LaPaglia's Ray as step brothers from opposite sides of the law who end up buying a race horse together. Nothing bothers Ray while Pally gets more and more stress as they get deeper into trouble. Very entertaining.
2,Kiefer Sutherland! Anthony LaPaglia! The Mafia! Horses!,"Thanks to network TV,Anthony LaPaglia and Kiefer Sutherland are well-known for their leading roles in ""Without a Trace"" and ""24."" However, this movie wasn't a smashing success for the both of them...due to its plotlessness.Sutherland stars as a former Boston cop who doesn't get to do much other than drink&cry; a lot. LaPaglia stars as his scheming,not too bright half-brother,complete with a soul patch&bleached; hair.They're convincing as brothers,but the script hobbles them. There's a plot involving horses and the Mafia,as well as a jockey's annoying,creepy daughter,who seems to be one of the Children of the Corn,or Damien's lil' sis.Radha Mitchell stars as Sutherland's perpetually confused ex,and reason for a gratutious,un-erotic love scene (but the violinists do get to play passionately.The orchestra swells in anticipation for...an anti-climax)""Dead Heat"" is a dead movie,despite two strong leading actors,the Mafia,and horses."
2,What on Earth is this?!,"The swindle begins by the cover art. It shows the two main characters (Pally and his brother and Charlotte), dressed in tie and very elegant. There's simply none of it in the movie!The story is absurd, the charcters have no charm, it's just another turkey."
4,A classic book of baseball memiors from a lifelong fan,"Art Hill's book is great reading for any fan of the game of baseball. Though focusing on one season of the Detroit Tigers, Mr. Hill shares memories of past seasons, favorite ballplayers, and some of the history of the game which he happened to witness from the unique perspective of the baseball fan. An easy and enjoyable read, Mr. Hill takes us on a trip through his lifelong love affair with the game. Though Mr. Hill spends a great deal of time writing about the Detroit Tigers, he does so without apology, because as he says, ""They're my team. That's baseball"";a feeling all fans of the game can understand. I highly recommend this book for any baseball fan."
2,More effort needed in this general recount of longears.,"I am forced to agree, despite the disageable writing, that this book contains *some* good information on longears. I rarely refer to this book when a training question arises, however, as the articles in this book are in need of articulation and clear diagrams. I am disappointed in the quality of this book especially as it is referred to as a rare publication of donkeys and other longears."
2,Aerogarden Herb Kit,"The herb kit I received with the Aerogarden unit was unimpressive.Most of the seeds failed to germinate.I have had no problems with their cherry tomato kit, which have grown about 2 inchs in only 9 days."
3,Also mixed results,I started this seed kit in February. All three plants grew well but one of the Red Heirloom did not get any flowers. The other I was able to harvest around 6 tomatoes and the Golden variety around 10 tomatoes total. After that I didn't get any more flowers due to having to keep the plants trimmed so they weren't growing into the lights. I would probably not purchase this seed kit again. I love the herb kits and have had nothing but success with them. The tomatoes I found too pricey for the actual yield I got.
3,Tomato limits,"Don't be disappointed - read the fine print - you can only grow three tomato plants in a seven pot AeroGarden or one plant in a three pot AeroGarden. Otherwise, it's a fine product."
2,"Aerogarden great, tomato seed kit not",We are at week 16 and still no tomatoes after following instructions to a T. Get the herbs. They last and are easy to maintain.
3,Some are great some are really bad,"I gave this product 3 stars because depending on the type it is a full 5 stars or only 1 star.The herb kit grew quick. My cilantro seeds didn't grow but they do have a warranty for that. The herbs grew like crazy although keep the basil trimmed or it will smother everything else. The choice of herbs is a little odd but they all grow really well together.The cherry tomato kit was horrible. It's a lot of work to try and get them to grow right and I've only had 1 tomato ever grow. The stalks want to grow tall but without anything to support them they start toppling over. Overall, way too much work to be worth it. It's easier to grow tomatoes in a pot!"
5,Sprouted in just 3 days,The seeds sprouted within 3 days just like it said and within a week tripled in size. Arugula is one of my favorite salad greens but I always have a tough time keeping them alive in my outdoor garden. So far it looks like the plants are going to thrive in the Aerogarden!
1,no peppers at all grows taller than garden,not advised to get this seed kit. the peppers grow taller than the aero-garden before setting any fruit.stick with the basic herbs that come with the original garden as they are the only ones that will grow in the limited space.
2,Disappointed with this kit.,This is the first Aerogarden kit that I have not been pleased with. My two Cilantro pods did not sprout at all. I contacted Aerogarden and they said there is a known issue with the Cilantro and they are investigating ways to fix it. I would not recommend purchasing this kit until they work out the problem.The other herbs are growing just fine. The Epazote is growing like crazy- although I'm not sure what to cook with it.
3,Some problems with germination,"We've had an Aerogarden for two years now and love it. This is the first time we have gotten the Japanese Herb Kit and it has some problems: the Red Shiso, Green Shiso and Nira Chives did not germinate at all. We e-mailed Aerogrow customer service department and they are sending us a new Japanese Herb Kit free of charge. We've used the herbs that did germinate: Chrysanthemum, Mitsuba and Cress in salads and on sandwiches. The flavors of these herbs is interesting, but we are really looking forward to using the Red and Green Shiso, which are more widely used in Japanese food."
5,Great winter pick-me-up,"This is the second year I have grown the cascading petunias. Last winter they were spectacular for months. I really like planting all of one kind of flower; it makes for a dramatic display, right when you need some color in your life. This year they have sprouted just as easily and quickly. I can't wait for the blooms to start."
1,Aerogarden Seed Kit,"Out of the seven seed packets, only four sprouted. I wrote the seller but have not heard back. My friend who has an Aerogarden said she's never had that many NOT sprout. I'm disappointed, because the seed kit is not cheap."
1,Did not sprout,"Bought this for my daughter-in-law, who is from Japan. She was excited to be able to grow fresh Japanese herbs indoors. Unfortunately, a couple of the pods never sprouted, and the others that did took such a long time and ultimately ended up dying shortly after coming up. I have purchased other seed kits from Aerogrow and have had great success. This one was a dud. After the fact, I did some research and found that others had marginal success, so not sure if it was something we did, or just a bad batch of seeds. Amazon was great about refunding the full purchase price, and I thought about purchasing another to see if we would have better luck, but decided against it based on the few reviews I read. Maybe others will have better luck."
1,greens are not growing,"My package arrived quickly, but was not packaged well. (Squished) The salad greens, which I started 4 weeks ago, began to grow and then whithered and are now dying. This is the 4th kit I have done and I have checked everything on my end. I know I did everything right and I never had a problem with any others. (2 bought at stores and 1 bought on line/different vender) Not sure what the problem is, but I'm guessing the kit was old. I guess that is my fault for not checking the date and have since thrown the box away. Will be more careful in the future buying kits."
3,"Clearly handly, if a bit overpriced","Bought both the aerogarden, and master gardener deluxe kit, for my sister with the brown thumb. Fit and finish seem good, ease of use can't be faulted, and she's already got plants growing in a remarkably short time, which given her success at converting seeds into little blobs of mold is nothing short of miraculous. OTOH, a quick review of what goes into it, from the perspective of a mechanical engineer, suggests that it's vastly overpriced. I do hope they'll be bringing the price down in months to come. There could be a huge market for it at a more reasonable price."
2,"Easier, but overpriced","This kit saves you the time of making your own, but at three times the cost. Anyone can buy bulk planting sponges or rock wool and make their own for a couple dollars. However, if you don't care about the price and want to make Aero Garden planting fast, easy, and thoughtless, then this is made for you. The kit is great, just uncomfortably priced for what you get."
1,Dont waste your money,Dont waste your money on on this. Use rock wool instead. I called the company asking what kinds foam is in their kits and they wouldn't tell me they described it as bio degradable special foam - so I called a couple of foam companies asking questions and experimented a bit. What worked best for me and is drastically cheaper is rock wool instead.
2,Not much there for the money.,"This package contains some foam seed holders, a few plastic cup sections to hold them, and some clear ""caps"" for the seed pods. Also, there are about a dozen blank circular papers to stick on the seed pods to identify your crop type. That's it!Re-use the original pod components and stay away from this item. $39.00 for $2.00 worth of plastic, paper, and foam."
1,Don't bother,"Don't bother spending the money. Re-use the pods you already have. I've picked up Rapid Rooters and Dyna-Gro 7-9-5 plant food from a hydroponics store, and I've had no problems growing two batches of lettuce and herbs from my own seeds."
1,NO on Petunias,"Just a warning: stay away from the petunias. They are horrible. No one has mentioned them here, so maybe I was the only one stupid enough to try them. That is good...because they are an unsightly mess. A real waste of time and money."
3,Leggy Lettuce,"I love my aerogarden, my herbs are doing well, but my lettuce leaves are long and leggy and I don't know why. The instructions say that when they develop stalks its time to remove. Mine were like that from the beginning! Not sure why. But it still tastes good. I'm buying the tomatoes next time."
1,NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS PURCHASE!!!,"I am SO NOT happy about purchsing this item. It is NOT as described. What the description says is ""Italian Basil, Purple Basil, Chives, Dill, Mint, Parsley & Thyme,"" what I got was Genovese Basil, Thyme, Mint, Lemon Basil, Oregano, Dill, Global Basil. I'm EXTREMELY angry that I did not get what I ordered. If they were going to make a substition, they should have asked. If automatic substitions are their policy, they should state that in the description. If the description is wrong, THEY SHOULD FIX IT. This item has been listed with this description for MONTHS before I purchased it. If I had wanted 3 kinds of basil, I would have purchased the basil mix. I expressly wanted the chives and the parsley. Buyer beware."
3,Not quite as advertised,"While my green bean garden hasn't yet made it to the blossoming stage, I'm somewhat disappointed with this kit for a couple of reasons, but mainly because the included accessories don't match the instruction booklet. There are no holes in the seed pods to insert the support coil wires, which has resulted in about half of my bean plants falling over and breaking once they got more than about 6 inches high. I've grown green beans indoors hydroponically by other methods, and the plants required lots of extra support. I just don't see these plants reaching the harvest stage with the included equipment. Also, one of the seeds failed to sprout - although the do give you a few extra, the one I replaced it with didn't sprout either, and by then there was no point in trying again as any further sprouts would be too far from the lights."
5,Wow! See it grow before your eyes!,"Got this salad packet since one of my New Year's resolution was to make more healthy/organic green stuff for the family (loose weight).In one day, it started to grow. Seems like each time I go by & look, it's growing. I can't wait to taste it. Will update once I eat the first salad from it."
5,Have used for 3-4 years now,I have used the aerogarden for 3-4 years now and always have good luck with the Basil seed kit.
3,Room for quality improvement,"I love the concept. Living in New York apartment, it's great to be able to grow your own herbs. We use them for cooking and aromas are great. However in my first kit chives never came up. I spoke to customer support and they made me wait a few weeks before they have sent the chives replacement, but by the time it was too late, as all the other plants were huge, so the new seeds didn't really have a chance. I have planted my second kit a few weeks ago, and this time sage didn't sprout. Chives are also looking weak, dominated by huge basil and sorrel. Obviously, I am quite annoyed with dead seeds in both kits."
3,Poor Variety and Cilantro doesn't Grow!,"Contains Italian Basil, Purple Basil, Chives, Parsley, Mint, Cilantro and Dill. Like many others have stated, the Cilantro never grew. I tried a replacement and it never grew either. I have had to replace 2 motors in the Aerogarden itself. (I have 3, was so excited when I got the first one, I immediately ordered 2 more). Customer Service is easy to reach and eager to help...BUT...they keep getting complaints about the same kind of things, especially motors quitting...and have not solved the problem yet. While it is quite enjoyable watching my salad greens, tomatoes, and herbs grow...it is quite aggravating have so frequent problems...and Cilantro is my favorite herb...can't get it to grow!"
2,Growing Tomatoes in my Aero Garden,"I thought what fun. Fresh tomatoes all year round. The tomatoes bushes grew and grew and went past my hood of my garden and drooped over the top. I am loaded with tons of green tomatoes. Unfortunately, the bottom of the stems are slowly dying and I will end up not harvesting any tomatoes.I have 3 aerogardens. I have tried the lettuces----GREAT. Herbs---GREAT. Petunia-----still blooming up a storm. The tomatoes.....I am hoping to salvage two plants by taking them OUT of the 'water' and planting them in real soil. The Aero Garden works great on the above except the tomatoes.I love my machines. I have given the Aero Garden as Christmas and birthday presents....(I should have stock) but, the tomatoes are a bust. Sorry."
2,Fruitless,"After having been reasonably successful with the initial herb seeds that came with the garden, I thought tomatoes would be a nice next step.The tomato plants grew quickly and required a lot of trimming and pruning. They also do require support to keep them from falling over.After 5 monthsI saw some yellow tomatoes (the kit comes with 2 red tomato pod and 1 yellow one). I have not harvested them yet, since they still show hues of green. So I cannot comment on the taste.The red tomatoes never came to fruition. One of them became sick or certainly looked sick so I pulled it. The idea is nice - unfortunately the execution lacks."
4,Salad greens,"Although quite tasty and very prolific I found the greens somewhat ""soft"", my husband who dislikes salad greens normally however liked the texture. I only used three of the greens and still have to eat a salad every other day to keep up with the growth."
1,Disappointing!,"I love my AeroGarden and was thrilled with the herbs and even happier with the cherry tomatoes. When I discovered the green bean kit, I couldn't wait to try it. My five-year old son loves green beans, and I was looking forward to having fresh beans to give to him. When I planted the green beans, they grew rapidly just like the other kits. However, the plants just grew and grew. They became overly bushy and never produced any beans. I waited and waited for the beans to grow and then finally tossed the plants out and replanted tomatoes. This kit was very disappointing, and I am hesitant to try it again."
2,43% grew,"We must have gotten old stock. It does have the sponge material instead of peat moss, it did not have the liquid nutrients and the tablets were falling apart, and now after 4-5 weeks, I have one very healthy basil and one very small thyme, and a small mint. So 3 out of 7 actually sprouted/grew. So now I get to call the company and ask for a replacement :(Update: 9/3/2010I called and they are sending a replacement. They are strongly recommending distilled water so there will be no trace minerals ... will update on success/failure when it arrives."
1,Worthless,"The plants grew huge, flowered, but never produced tomatoes. We shook them like the instructions said, but zero tomatoes. On top of that, over the last few weeks, it has gotten very loud. Sounds like the pump is loosing a bearing or something. We have cleaned it, but still loud. Very disappointed. My wife wants to toss the whole thing in the trash."
3,"So far so good, but you will need to purchase more nutes","Product states you can harvest after 3 weeks and keep harvesting for four months, but only enough nutes for 2 months.Liquid nutes come need to m]be mixed well before used because some nutes turned into a solid in the corner in the small bag.Will update as time goes on."
1,Huge disappointment for the price,"I received the box, which contained--to my surprise--three spots with the rest spacers for the tomatoes. At a price of $19.95 (and I'm not that price sensitive), I thought this was seriously over priced. Worse, while two of the plants are well on their way, the third never sprouted. Did some investigation, and there were no seeds in the third. So, I basically paid $10 a tomato seed. As much as I love cherry tomatoes, and have loved other aero garden kits very much, I would not recommend this one."
4,Nice to have fresh greens in the winter,"The 4 stars is so you are not disappointed with the lettuce, it's pretty soft and limp although tasty!"
1,No Tomatoes,"I purchased the cherry tomato 3 pod seed kit about one year ago. I followed the booklet's guidelines exactly. There was much leaf growth and occasionally a few flowers, but no tomatoes ever appeared. $20 is way too much for zero production! I'll stay with herbs from now on. By the way, amazon's service and speed of delivery were excellent."
3,Thyme and Oregano did not sprout.,"Like the cherry tomato plants that I purchased last summer, not all of the ""kits"" work as described.It could be that maybe I did something wrong, but with this kit, only the 3 basil pods have sprouted.They were planted a month ago."
1,Do Not Purchase,Only 1 plant grew and then it died. I have two gardens and greenbeans don't work.Everything else is a gardeners dream.
3,make sure you have something to attach the plants too...,plants grow well until it hits the top of the light because it cannot go any higher and starts to tip over.
4,too big for my machine?,This is growing fine but I have the 3 pod model and the tomato plant is so tall that it is burning itself on the light. It said this plant was compatible with the 3 pod model but I'm not so sure....
1,What???!!! One Sprout in a Month???,"I started my first Aero Garden with great success; it gave me more herbs than I could keep up with. However, when I ordered this International Basil seed kit, despite following the re-plant instructions to the letter, after about a month, I have just one basil sprout, approximately 3 cm above the label. The package says they're ""guaranteed to grow"" but says nothing about how to redeem that guarantee if they don't grow. Now I've spent over $20 on something that didn't even work. What a waste!"
3,Hydroponic garden,The herb garden does bloom but the blooms were sparse not like the video at the web site. The parlsey never bloomed
4,Cherry Tomato Seed Kit,"This is a great product. Not to mention it is at a discounted price, which we all love. I would recommend this seller time and again simply for the ease of purchase and the quick shipping."
4,"Would LOVE to purchase, but not sure of the herb selection","This growing system sounds amazing and perfect, esp living in the desert.I hestitate to buy now, because I want to grow just ONE type of basil, Chives (which are very difficult to find and grow here) parsely, dill, oregano and thyme. Why aren't there any kits with oregano or thyme? Or do they not work with this system? Any info would be much appreciated. Thanks, Pam"
1,Aerogarden refill kit,"Shipping was fast. Grow tablets were sealed in celephane and, obviously, are giving off moisture as it is collecting in each separate pouch. Doubt they will last the year they are supposed to. Also, I am not ""couch potato as it says in the title."
1,Not the right plants for the AeroGarden!,"Ok, I love the Aerogarden and it worked great with my last batch of herbs. But the tomatos grow very fast and even with tons of trimming, I can't seem to keep them away from the lights. But that is not the biggest problem. Since the roots are not attached to anything, the tomato plants fall over in all directions. You can TRY to follow the instructions to tie them up somehow but the reality with the garden is that it is not easy to do so. There is only the one hood support to use. So even using garden ties, velcro, etc, the plants are always flopping around. If Aerogrow is reading this - I have a suggestion for you: Use the four ""unused"" holes in the tray to hold some sort of support towers for plants that get that big or need to climb. There could be some sort of snap in cone or something to help hold plants up."
2,The herbs were great...but the cherry tomatoes...not so great,"The herb kit that came with my Aerogarden was superb and I enjoyed caring for my little garden. Once it was time to replace it, I purchased the cherry tomato seed kit. These also grew rapidly, but one day I noticed that they had completely fallen over...how would I stake these on an Aerogarden? And yes, the lights were as close to the plants as possible. I kind of leaned them against each other to keep them upright. But they still fell over several times. So they grew and grew but I never got any tomatoes. :( I also did follow the directions to ensure that they had complete darkness for proper flowering. Fortunately we have several tomato and cherry tomato plants in our outdoor vegetable garden. Unfortunately, I spent $20 on 3 cherry tomato Aerogarden plants and got zero yield."
4,Basil explosion,"My gourmet herb kit came with basil, mint, chives, dill, thyme, and parsley, but I refer to it simply as my basil garden. The dill sprouted late, grew one anemic stalk, and then keeled over dead. The mint likewise made a meager appearance before turning brown. The thyme and chives were small but enjoyable, and I had given up on the parsley before it finally flourished and seasoned a few meals.But OH MY GOD DO I HAVE BASIL! I've trimmed it aggressively many times, only to have it return bigger and bushier and beating out the other herbs for light. I celebrated the fresh basil for a while, but now I stuff it unceremoniously into ziplocs and store it in the freezer until one day when it will all become pesto.Judging from mine and other reviewers' experiences, the aerogarden produces imperfect and unpredictable results -- but it has been fun to have fresh, growing herbs within my lightless apartment even if the outcome was not as planned. I look forward to trying other seed kits."
2,Salad Greens kit,"This is the kit I used first with my AeroGarden. It sprouted well and was ready to harvest in 3 weeks. My problem is that there is not enough lettuce for 2 dinner size salads. You are also supposed to only harvest 1/3 of the product, which is enough for a small side salad.It takes about a week from picking to be able to harvest again, and the plants do have long stems. I won't be getting this kit again. Hopefully the Herbs will be better."
1,Intl Basil Doesn't Work In All Aero Gardens,"The International Basil kit only works in the 7 pod gardens, which is not specified anywhere in the product description. After realizing that the basil was not sprouting, I discovered the reason why - this kit is not compatible with the 6 pod garden - the pods are shorter and do not reach the water! Very disappointed - my rating is due to the product description."
2,Amazon must have an old batch,"Be warned: Amazon must have an old or bad batch of herb seeds. Only 4 of the 7 seed pods grew (the parsley, chives and dill never sprouted), and this is our second batch that had some fungus or mold in the purple basil pod. They have changed from the tablet nutrients to some liquid nutrients in a bag, two of which leaked (one was nearly empty and leaked all over the instruction booklet).The seed pods that did grow are growing wonderfully (more basil, mint and thyme that we can use), but it seems to be a shot in the dark whether you'll get a good batch.Based on the quality of this product, I cannot recommend purchasing it."
4,cherry tomato kit,My cherry tomatoes came up in 3 days and they are doing very. This would be a fun kit for children.
3,Convenient replacement purchase,I wish we could have been able to make our own selection of the different seeds in the seed kit.
1,Cherry Tomato Seed Kit - only one plant grew,I purchased two kits and only one plant grew from each kit. It was a waste of money. The plant is now dying and still not one tomato.
2,2 for 7 so far.. NOT GOOD!!,"So far we used 7 pods in the AeroGarden and only two have come up. Honestly those two are doing really well, but the rest are DOA!!!"
3,Gem,"This is an overlooked rarely seen little gem. Typical 50's fare western, however, it contains a huge cast of some of the best known character actors of the era. This fact alone makes this film worth watching. Payne is more than adequate and although appearing tired and a little weather beaten, Duryea still has shining moments of his brilliant old snarly self from his heydays. Harry (Dobe) Carey Jr. plays a bad guy in this one but you still can't help but like him......"
5,Different kind of western,"A taut western, very suspenseful. Much has been made of the MacCarthyism theme in this movie and it is there. Well acted with lots of familiar faces from the westerns of the era. The action takes place entirely within a small town which raises the thrill level even more. After all, how can someone remain hidden in such a small place. It is not a typical horse and cowboy shoot-em-up flick. Still though it is exciting to watch."
2,"MEDS WON""T HELP","My wife suffers from the devastating affects of Fibromyalgia. She finds this DVD ineffective ... at least for her. It's tragic that for years Fibro has not been recognized by the medical community as a disorder, but rather akin to hypochondria. And this, too: For three years she has been denied federal disability even though she is unable to work—or even perform light household chores ... even unable to lift a gallon of milk from the fridge. I'm thankful, however, that she was not chosen to to inherit Lupus."
1,terrible product and not worth listening to at any price.,"This DVD may be good as a CD but not as a DVD. The format is two women talking with each other. One of the women has her back to the camera. There is no action or visuals of any kind except for the two women talking. They do not use microphones. The camera is stationary and set up at a distance from the women so that the whole picture of the women can be included. The only microphone is the microphone attached to the camera. Because of the distance, the woman facing the camera is difficult to hear but the woman with her back to the camera/microphone cannot be heard at all. The higher the volume is turned up, the greater the background noise.This might have been much better as a CD where the women would each have a microphone and the listener would be able to have a clear understanding of their topic."
1,Will not play........,Will not play in newer DVD/BlueRay player. Would send it back if I had paid more. Due to format should not be sold to US customers.
3,"""Not the best . . .but . . .","For those of us who cherish the steamy city of New Orleans, Zandalee captures the steaminess while transcending its shortcomings.Rehinhold could have made more of an effort to exhibit a more tragic figure - and could have made an attempt at maintainingANY accent. Cage is satan personified. More than a bit melodramatic in many scenes, good cameo appearances by Marissa Tomei, Joe Pantoliano (pricesless cross-dresser!) and Steve Buscemi (playing Steve Buscemi) add to the memorable scenes and memorable/quotable dialogue: (""I'm your reality check"" ""Its a heartifact"" ""A little decorum!"".Its worth the 3 bucks to rent of the $ to buy it. Nice steamy, sexy movie. Not the greatest . . . but . . ."
2,An OK DVD transfer,"I'm going to review the DVD , not the movie!This DVD transfer is OK , but it lacks extras. There is np scene access, no captions, no letterbox or pan scan on the same DVD. This movie looks like it was copied from the VHS tape to DVD!Onlu buy if you like the stars or movie!Remember you were warned first by me!Buyer beware if you expect caption,commentaries,scenes access ,trailers etc!This disk contains none of those features!!"
2,Not as good as I remember.,"Zandalee, Zandalee, Zandalee.Where do I start? Well, I watched this movie on cable a couple of times when I was still a child, and I remember it being a good but forbidden movie. I decided to buy the movie before it became obsolete and enjoy a smut classic. But watching it as an adult has shown me one thing: it's bad in every way. From the bad Louisiana accents to the narcotics inspired acting by Nicolas Cage to the pedestrian acting by Ericka Alexander to the silly script writing. It's very bad. Even the s/ex scenes are not as good as I remembered: a couple come off as rape scenes, which will always be dangerous considering how many confuse rape with consentual desire already. I guess my changing view about Zandalee says a lot about the eyes and mind of a 12 year old versus that of a 25 year old.Bottom Line: No wonder the film has been conveniently forgotten by those who had anything to do with it."
3,Not the best ever . . . but,"The score by ""Pray for Rain"" (not available ANYWHERE) is great.For those of us who love New Orleans, this film captures the steaminess of that city and the romance of Zan and Cage. Steamy in all senses, this film somehow overcomes all its shortcomings with its quirky dialogue, and endearing appearances by Marisa Tomei, Steve Busciemi and Joe Pantoliano. Rheinhold could have managed to exhibit more ""tragedy"" in his situation - and his accent changed in evry other scene, but Cage's is that of satan himself. Worth the 3 bucks to rent or the $ +/- to purchase. Also full of memorable, repeatable wonderful one-line quotes! (""I'm your reality check"" ""Say my name"" ""Please! some decorum!"")"
4,great combination,These games are execellant to play using the Microsoft Sidewinder Freestyle pro. It makes it easier to control the bikes and gives me more flexabilty while driving. Overall all of these games are just flat out fun to play.
5,A lovely selection,"I cherish this recording. Just today I spent an hour transferring it from cassette to CD-R for convenient playback. The music is surprisingly strong and varied, and all beautifully played."
5,Tuscany Idea,"I was thinking about buying the Tuscany bedding set. I see that people are complaining about a lack of accessories.... I had an idea. Cut portions of the wall border which can be purchased for this set and frame it for matching pictures. You could even use the wall border as decoupage to make other accessories (storage boxes, light switch covers, etc.)"
2,Ties are not secure,"I too purchased this bedding because of its neutral colors. I liked the color scheme, the thickness of the bumper, and the soft fabric, but was disappointed in the lack of ties on the bumper. Only 8 altogether, and unlike a previous reviewer mine had no bottom ties. I have a standard crib and the bumper is almost and inch too short, so there was a gap where the two ends didn't meet. Also, after two days one of the ties popped off altogether; literally just fell off at the seam. I'm returning this to BRU tomorrow, and I'll be purchasing a different set."
3,Poor Support Service,"Assembly was not very difficult, however when the last piece that you put together does not fit, and you cannot use the new bike for 3 weeks, it does not make one happy. I had to call LifeGear four times to complain, and finally after telling me twice that it had been sent, a manager sent the seat back overnight UPS. This is what they should have done in the first place. The bike itself seems fine, however, it was the poor support from the LifeGear parts department that I was most unhappy about."
2,"Very rough reading, no plot, no dialogue","I appear to be in the minority in my review. Obviously, the author put many hours of work in this, years of research, and had a passion for Hadrian. Maybe I have lowbrow taste, but kept turning the pages waiting for anything to arouse my interest. There were too many names and places with which I was not familiar. I don't have the patience to stop and look up every name or place mentioned. There was no plot, no suspense, and no humor. In short, nothing I could find to make the book readable. It is like reading the encyclopedia. There is plenty of information, but it had no entertainment value for me at all. Reading all of the reviews makes me feel stupid, but all I can do is warn those who are hoping to get some enjoyment from this book. I hope you have better luck with it than I did!"
4,Memoirs of Hadrian,"Written in the form of a letter, memoir-tutorial to his nephew, the young Marcus Aurelius. Succeeding the stern super-centurion, Trajan, the Emperor comments on a wide variety of issues; his discourse on vegetarianism is highly illuminating and even amusing.I will neither deny nor excuse the few comments of an anti-semitic nature but her training and skill as a historian makes this book exceptional for its depiction of classical Roman civilization.(or lack thereof) Maybe the best history as fiction ever written."
5,The most perfect literary creation of the century,"A perfectly created historical novel. A long-life letter From Adriano to his sucessor, where the prose is immaculate and brilliant. A work perfectly balanced between story, writing style and charachter. The latter being incredibly interesting, perhaps even more interesting and 'real' than the real Emperor. A powerful and enchanting reflection upon every possible issue in life. A masterpiece of literature."
5,A fascinating journey; a fascinating character,"A modern classic. Yourcenar captures the spirit of the times and, I believe, the spirit of this complex and unique Roman Emperor. This book was a joy to read; when I was finished reading it, I found the re-created Hadrian to be a boon companion and was sad that our journey together had ended. Highly recommended."
3,A flawed modern masterpiece,"Whoever thought Yourcenar wrote this when she was 24 is completely mistaken. She may well have conceived it then. But it took an awfully long time, and she pursued the project to what some might regard as lunatic extremes, compelling herself to truly take on the character of the emperor hadrian, that is, project herself into a roman man living in the 2nd c ad. As such it is a fascinating work; but at the same time a paradox, leaves a dry taste in the mouth, as it hammers on relentlessly about the darker aspects of existence, spoiled love, death, the ultimate meaningless of things even for this great man who designed the parthenon and elected marcus aurelius as one of his heirs. Definitely worth a look. But don't be foolish and read it instead of a classic like Stendhal's 'Charterhouse of Parma', the greatest book in French."
3,A fascinating look back,"Written as a series of letters by Hadrian, Yourcenar's novel is an intriguing look into life in Ancient Rome. Although the historical fiction parts of the novel sometimes are quite dry, it's the analysis and thought-provoking reflections that come from it, especially towards the end of the book, that make this book one of the 100 Best Gay & Lesbian Novels. Including political and social influences, as well as Hadrian's relationship with Antinous, Yourcenar crafted a marvelous fictional memoir of a man mired in his own life."
2,"tough going, totally narrative, no plot, but educational","After reading all the great reviews here, I bought this book but found it a real 'snoozer'. Don't read this book lying down! Sitting up, with no distractions, it's not so bad. It's written authentically, as if translated from the Latin. Paragraphs go on for miles. Good luck!"
3,Robert Graves did it better,"Her research is quite evident. But when I finished the book I still had the feeling that I didn't really understand the inner man.It's interesting to note how an author can cause you to feel sympathy for a man who ordered the deaths of tens of thousands of people and who ethnically cleansed Judea of Jews even going so far as to change the name of the country. If he were alive today he would be condemed as a muderous dictator.Overall, I think that Robert Graves did it better."
3,overrated,"Critically acclaimed first novel by the most renowned female author France has ever produced.Hadrian, a 2nd Century Roman Emperor, addresses a long letter to his successor, Marcus Aurelius. He muses upon his own life, power, his vision of the Roman Empire and a myriad of other topics. Yourcenar ends up providing a complex portrait of Hadrian and his times, however, the story is so internal that it's somewhat static.GRADE: C+"
2,Beware---Knowledge has Its Price...,"Unless you are a scholar, an academic or someone who has a special interest in Hadrian and/or olden times of ancient Rome, don't go here...Yes, it has good material and interesting information, but finding that good stuff is like looking for a needle in a haystack....a big, big haystack. The book is wordy, verbose and long, long, long, long...Unlike today's historical novels, this one, written or translated in the 1950s, really shows its age...writing style and even layout and page presentation add to its difficulty.Yes, there is interesting material here...but it may well best be found by reading a Cliff Notes type summary...Bookrags has a good one..."
2,Holmes has no rivals.,"This is the 3rd collection of early detective stories edited by Greene. I have to admit that most stories are very badly written. But of course, it is not the fault of the editor, but of the incompetent authors."
4,Great book - great ideas!,"This is a beautiful book that contains many wonderful ideas aimed at people who are ""coordinating"" their own wedding. It offers many different and simple solutions that not only cost less than traditional methods, but look beautiful as well. My only complaint is that the book is sectioned out by ceremony/reception location and if your location is not among those listed, it requires you to cross-reference to other sections to find ideas that would work. Also, the website that you are sent to for more information not listed in the back is not helpful."
5,Very Satisfied,Beautiful book full of ideas on how to plan for a simple or elegant wedding. This book is well worth the price.
3,Eh,"Ok, I don't know what I saw in this book in the first place. You can find much better pictures online. There was a lot of words, and not that many pictures."
2,Has nice photos but not too useful,I felt like my wife and I would've been better off just Googling things to see ideas. There were a lot of photos in the book but it was hard to get usable ideas from this. Most of the ideas were far too lavish and expensive to do or they'd take so much creative genius to create that they were impossible for us. I wish we'd bought a different book.
4,More of a Look Book,"I liked this book but found it more helpful as a ""Look Book"" full of great picture inspirations than anything else. It has some great explanations of how to keep your decor simple and get the most effect from it, so it is helpful in the early planning stages of your wedding when you're thinking about themes, etc."
3,"Not for young children, there should be a warning","The movie started out wonderful and was very thought provoking BUT it is not something that should have been in the family section without a warning to parents of young children. If you have not had the ""talk"" with your children about all lifestyles and same sex relationships then be prepared to while watching this. I was disappointed that the subject matter came out of nowhere in this movie. It was my own fault for not reading the reviews carefully. I will watch the whole thing with my 14 year old when my younger one is at a sleepover."
4,GOOD MOVIE,IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE THIS MOVIE NO ONE UNDERSTOOD THE BOY I NEVER EVEN KNEW THIS WAS A TRUE STORY SO IT WAS INTERESTING TO READ IT
1,Do NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,This Book was stolen from the library of lane techincal high school! It is too expensive anyways! Do NOT buy this book!
3,Check the Paperback Size!,"No matter how other may rave about this book, you must beware the paperback size. It is so much reduced from the hardcover that the print is difficult to read. With my reading glasses it is possible, but without them, it is all a blurr. I would definitely recommend the purchase of the larger hardcover version."
5,Beautiful and impressive!,"This is a beautiful book on Leonardo's paintings! It is impressive for the excellent quality of the color figures and the amount of information about the technical aspects of and story around each painting. The appendices include a list of 31 of Leonardo's paintings with essential details on their size, year, and the name of the museum or collection where they are conserved. Also, the appendices have a list of 12 lost works among which the mural painting titled ""The Battle of Anghiari"" is probably one of the most cited. Scholars suggested that ""The Battle"", which Leonardo did not complete, was covered by a fresco of Vasari painted on the walls of Palazzo Vecchio in Firenze. A rich bibliography with more than 600 entries can be found at the end of the book. For an excellent biography of Leonardo, I suggest you read ""Leonardo: the artist and the man"" by Serge Bramly."
2,"great voice, rotten songs","Like so many French CD's, the voice is great, the songs are not. This does not apply to Lara Fabian, who writes most of her songs and is clearly a tremendously gifted songwriter. But Maurane, who has a very appealing voice and style, just cannot seem to find songs that really ""stick with you"" and make you want to hear over and over again. Overall this CD was a disappointment."
1,worst i ever met,"this cellar phone sucks,it always freezes,lost signs during calling.The charger is bad too,will never buy it if could."
5,GREAT Games,"These games are worth every cent of the cost, and you won't regret buying them. Heck, except for 2, they're all worth at least $20 in their own right. With 2, the graphics aren't too hot, but the rest of the graphics are adequate. A lot of people will tell you that SWAT's no good, but it isn't that bad, only different. So, if you want something different and fun that will contain you for hours, GET THIS GAME PACK. And, have fun!"
5,Sonny Bonds is my hero,"Easily one of the most dynamic series ever programmed, Sierra's Police Quest series was one of the first games I've played, and still the most fun game I've ever played, Go after the Death Angel with Sonny Bonds and beyond..."
2,the first review,They need to include a manual with swat two as it confused the ---- out of me. But over all the series was good. It made you face the situations realistically and was challenging while at the same time entertaining. The graphics are crap but considering when the games were made it is understandable. It would be cool if they remade games 2-4 with better graphics and a more user friendly interface like they did pq1.
5,Help Please Read!,"In the pack that has PQ1,234&5 is the remade version of PQ1 in it? E-mail me at DBZ31689@aol.com, THANKYOU IF YOU HELP!"
5,Eating Raodl,"This movie is the best funny movie I have ever seen. Very very different. You should buy several of them, and give them to people for their birthday, or whatever. Best, best, best, Friend."
4,Devents Are in the Eye of the Beholder,"What do you do when you want to finance your bed and breakfast but you dont have the money and your apartment building is filling up with swingers? Well you put an add in all the swingers magazines, try to hook your wife, and then kill her clients. And these are the moral people in the story. This is one incredbley strange but funny story about love, killing, swingers, locksmiths, wine, women, and how to serve people."
3,Eating Raoul - a tasty movie,"Eating Raoul is a good case for not judging a movie by the poster (or box). The stars of this movie include a very straight-laced married couple whose role seems to be making fun of religious conservatives. They play this role in a farcial manner. Equally treatment is given to ""swingers"" who marked the period in which this movie was made. The swingers are the offset and victims of the stars. The third star of this cult classic is the title character Raoul - their partner in crime. This is not a family movie. You would spend time explaining why the female lead is doing things like dressing as Minnie Mouse and is chased around the room. There is one scene containing nudity of the female lead but this is a sex farce. The whole movie centers around adult themes."
2,Bad transfer - everyone's short & fat,"Several others have mentioned this. It's true, and it is very noticeable and takes away from the pleasure of watching. The movie is weird, quirky fun, although not for all tastes to be sure. But the short, squat figures just don't look right. And you can't fix it at home. They'd have to re-release it, fat chance with the tiny audience for specialty films. Arrggh.I kept it anyway, better than nothing. But the shortened, fattened appearance of the actors is a real pain."
1,rubbish,this films a lot of rubbish. if you have never seen a movie before or spoken to someone or done anything ever you may just may not hate this. it's stupid and old and should be put down like the dirty bad dog it is just like we put down our dirty bad dog for being dirty and bad ha ha i'm laughing about it just even thinking about it now.
1,Error Fraught,"I don't think Jody read a single DRoP book before writing this, nor did her editor. The book is fraught with anomalies, contradictions to Anne's works, and internal contradictions. The information, although sometimes thorough, is presented haphazardly, with entire paragraphs being repeated in different areas, information out of place, etc. There are numerous instances of contradictory information within pages of each other and more contradictions the the DRoP books than you can shake a stick at. The portraits look as though the people are FROM another planet, not simply living on one. The new chapters in the second edition are merely synopses (sp?) of the new stories and contain no further information. Should I go on? I was completely dissapointed after hearing that this was the ""authoritative guide to PERN""."
2,Good but a bit off.,"This book is very helpful when you want to find something out but I found that many of the more minor information, like if there was or was not a queen dragon in F'lessan's dragon's cluch. I prefer the books actually written by Anne McCaffrey."
1,Very misleading and inconsistent!!!!,"I was infuriated by this ""guide"" to Pern. Not only is it not up to standard to the 1st edition, it's very inconsistent in its contents. The descriptions in the series books don't match those in the guide. The drawings of places, objects, animals and people don't match the descriptions in books and the previously published pictures."
3,So so,"I admit to being spoiled by Robin Wood's Illustrations of Pern. The writing was interesting and explanatory of the Pern world of Anne McCaffrey - what badges belong to whom, where things are located, etc, but the illustrations were awkward and missing the believability & charm of ""The People of Pern."""
5,Guide to Pern,"Dragonlover's Guide to Pern is a spectacular book filled with wonderful descriptions, maps,drawings and yes even recipies! If you follow the dragonriders of Pern series you simply must own this book."
5,Best Informative guide For any Series,A great book to help comprehend the Dragonriders of Pern series. A good companion to have when reading any Pern book!
5,Baby loves it!,"I bought this mirror for my 4-month old and she immediately started pulling on the shapes, and trying to grab the mirror in general. She was really engaged by the colors, shapes, and sounds. It does not attach to the crib like some other mirrors, but it is stable on the ground, lightweight, and has a nice mirror (not as funhouse as some!). I will be ordering more of these for shower gifts in the future."
2,Plastic Covering,The Plastic covering on the mirror was really hard to get off because it was sown into the stitching aruond the mirror. It made me nervous about giving it to an infant as this could be a choking hazard if you missed a piece. Needless to say I returned mine because when I received it the mirror was already scratched and I did not order another one.
4,Odds and Sods Crowded House collection a keeper,"Although it doesn't hold together like their best albums this collection of b sides and unreleased tracks is a fairly consistent work. A number of the tracks here would have fit snugly on the CH albums and done credit to them.Is this collection worth it? It depends on how much of a fan you are of CH. This probably isn't the collection to buy as an introduction to the band. How are the songs? I'm in Love, Anyone Can Tell, Dr. Livingston and a handful of others are of top drawer songs. I Love You Dawn, although lyrically weak, has a solid melody. With the exception of Paul Hester's humorous but weak Telly tune, this is a solid collection and well worth adding to a CH collection. I'd suggest Together Alone and Woodface first."
4,Sometimes leftovers taste better than the original meal,"I, for one, did not lament the end of Crowded House too much because I am a Neil Finn fan and there was no doubt he would go on making great music, with or without his Enz or Crowdies bandmates. ""Together Alone"" is their crowning glory, so it was best that they went out with that. Having said that, however, basking in the afterglow isn't too bad. I already own or have heard these songs on various singles or fanclub CDs . . . but to have them all in one place, they sound better than ever. The three TA outakes are great, as are ""Recurring Dream"" (version two), ""I Love You Dawn,"" and ""Anyone Can Tell."" I've never cared for ""Dr. Livingston,"" but this improved version is better . . . If anything, it just makes me more eager for Mr. Finn's second solo CD."
4,last chance for some final great sounds from Crowded House,"For anyone who was devastated when the band decided to part ways, this is a little consolation prize worth every penny. Long a fan of the Finn's and the music they craft both together and apart, I'm amazed that most of these tracks didn't end up on some of the albums. Particularly well written, 'Lester' ( an ode to a nearly departed family member ), this song depicts exactly why Crowded House fans ARE Crowded House fans. Songs that depart from the standard chordal doldrums mixed with inventive lyrics that make you smile and feel. The only problem with getting one more great album like this from the band....is that now, I want even more. Please reconsider guys!"
4,Leftovers taste just as good as the original meal,"I, for one, did not lament the end of Crowded House too much because I am a Neil Finn fan and there was no doubt he would go on making great music, with or without his Enz or Crowdies bandmates. ""Together Alone"" is their crowning glory, so it was best that they went out with that. Having said that, however, basking in the afterglow isn't too bad. I already own or have heard these songs on various singles or fanclub CDs . . . but to have them all in one place, they sound better than ever. The three TA outakes are great, as are ""Recurring Dream"" (version two), ""I Love You Dawn,"" and ""Anyone Can Tell."" I've never cared for ""Dr. Livingston,"" but this improved version is better . . . If anything, it just makes me more eager for Mr. Finn's second solo CD."
3,"Not bad, but far from great","If you've heard songs from crowded house before and you like them then this is a must! Melodic and catchy are the two best words to describe this album. What's missing is substance. Like I said earlier, if you like them you'll love this. If you're trying to get into them give it a shot, but don't be suprised if you find yourself running across this cd in a pile a year from now."
5,Aural representation of feminine beauty.,Perhaps the single most beautiful (and easily accessible) work of art I have encountered.
3,Disappointed,"I could not bring myself to give this album 5 stars, as much as I love the Cocteau Twins.I only find the first 4 songs good. The rest just sound boring.I wasn't expecting to be this disappointed...The first four songs are amazing though.But it does seem like a stepback from Treasure and Victorialand...Nothing new really.Luckily they recovered with HoLV."
2,Hugh disappointment,"As a long time and avid fan of this little known progressive band I inserted this DVD into the player with great anticipation. Within minutes after the start I was overwhelmed with even greater disappointment. The audio quality is equal to a poor bootleg. Although the video quality is very good, the audio track is does not match the video. The audio and visual are out of sync with each other and the results are very distracting. I was forced to turn it off before the first song ended. Maybe it gets better after a while but I guess I'll never know since I do not possess the patience to go any further.I refuse to believe that a band of such high standards (as evidenced by the quality of all their other CD's) willingly gave their approval for such junk to be issued under their name. What a shame . . ."
3,A Good Book to Have,"This is a good book to read after you're finished ""Teach Yourself OWL Programming in 21 days"" by Ian Spencer, and Namir Clement Shammas' ""What Every Borland C++ 4 Programmer Should Know"". Tom Swan has written books on Assembler, C++, Delphi, Pascal and Java. Sometimes I wonder just how deep his knowledge can be."
3,The Goldin Days...,"Pathfinder to Mars was the highlight of Faster, Better, Cheaper and Howard McCurdy's book provides an overview of the management there through effective comparisons. The book is instructive as to the management of high-tech space projects during NASA's Dan Goldin years. Nonetheless, it appears that management can achieve only two elements of the triade of FBC at any given time effectively. Pathfinder was a remarkable exception to the general rule."
3,A bit small,Using it is actually a bit more difficult than I expected due to its size. It will do the job though.
1,BEWARE no registration available for password,"In order for this software to be permanent on your computer, it must be registered with the company who publishes it. They NO LONGER support the software and there is NO provision to register it for a password."
5,sonic rocks!,"one of the best seasons! they go to two of the best sonic games ever! its really amusing for people like me, 'cause my save file on SA2B croaked... LOL! but thats besides the point. but it was censored pretty bad as well. but i pop this into my laptop and watch it all the time! truly an awesome set as long as you know whats going on.~bluehedgehog12-the number one sonic fan!~"
2,Junk,"This thing is a piece of junk. If I had paid $100 for it I wouldn't be so mad, but the $300+ you pay for this including shipping is crazy.The instructions were horrible. There were about 30 steps, all of which were accomplished with pictures. Thats right, no directions at all, just pictures of what you are supposed to do with arrows. When I finally got it all together, nothing was level. Nothing was square. The doors don't match up. The drawers don't close right.I had a carpenter friend look at it for me and he said it was assembled ok by me, but the holes for parts to attach to were drilled in the wrong places by the factory and would have to be re-drilled in other locations to fix the problems.Save your money and buy a higher quality desk from an american manufacturer."
3,Iggy's best failure,"Despite ""Zombie Birdhouse"" is not precisely Iggy's best work, it is one of his most weird, eccentric and curious releases in his solo career. Maybe it's not perfect but it's an album that grows on you and showed that Iggy was an artist with great creativity who shifted easily from one musical style to another. Unfortunately, the album is too confusing and ambitious and becomes a bit monotonous after the first three songs. The lyrics are also slightly uninspired and do not add too much to this particular release. Buy it only if you are an Iggy's die-hard fan, if not, you probably won't find anything of interest in this bizarre experiment."
4,ALRIGHT,THESE GAMES HAD UPS AND DOWNS. THE GRAPHICS WEREN'T GREAT BUT IT WAS PRETTY REALISTIC FOR ALL THREE GAMES(CONSIDERING WHEN THEY WERE MADE). I WOULD RECOMEND THESE GAMES TO ANYONE WHO OWNS FLIGHT SIMULATOR GAMES AND ENJOYS FLYING CREATIVE MISSIONS.
2,WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!,"OK....LETS START OUT with flight unlimited. The gameplay is alright and the maps are also cool. There is only a selection of two planes though. And while playing this game, it will randomly freeze and close out. Everytime I would crash, the game would freeze.Next, Longbow gold. This game is extremely hard. The controls are horrible and I bet it would be easier to navigate a Longbow in real life than in this game.Last, usnf '97. This game had the best potention of the three. It has many aircrafts to choose from and also many weapons to custimize those planes. It comes with many missions, except the game will close out whenever you engage in combat. It is extremely frustrating. When you plug 25 mins into a mission to find an enemy and when you finally do, the game closes, it is very annoying.Overall, this game is not worth any price. DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
2,Wouldn't recommend it,"Uneven toasting ruins an otherwise decent product for the price. Not bad looking, sleek matte black finish, so it's attractive on a counter. The first item you toast comes out less done, the next will be darker. So it's unpredictable in that respect. Wouldn't recommend it."
1,Piece of JUNK!!!,"This toaster is a TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK!!! It completely stopped working after only using it for 3 months, which since I rarely eat toast, means that it toasted about 12 pieces of bread and then broke. Amazon only gives a 1 month return window and so I just [...] I will never buy some appliances from Aroma or Amazon again. Costco will be getting all of my business from now on!!!"
5,Great Toaster,"This is an excellent product. It's very nice and retro looking and works really well. I love the fact that it has a cancel button so anytime you want to stop the toasting process, you hit the button and the bread pops up. My last toaster did not have this feature so I am very pleased."
1,Stay away from this toaster,"If all you care about is how the toaster looks then this is fine. It is a good looking toaster which is why I purchased it, however, the performance is terrible. Tried several types of bread and settings and the results were the same every time, toasted on one side but almost raw on the other. And no it was not set on the bagel setting. In fact it is the inside faces of both slices that would not brown."
1,Fire Hazard?,Black smoke and a terrible smell occurred each time I tried to use the toaster...much more than expected when running for the first time. Returned before even trying it with food because I was afraid of a fire.
3,OK but arrived cracked,"Toaster works decently enough - pay for what you get. Was disappointed, however, that it arrived from Amazon with cracks in the painted casing. Was going to send it back for a replacement, but was too much of a hassle (which is why I bought it online in the first place instead of in the store)."
2,Avoid this product,"When I received my first one, I was disappointed in the quality and, sure enough (as others have reported) after a few months the toast wouldn't stay down. The warranty replacement exhibited the other ""feature"" complained of, namely uneven cooking. Another ""feature"" which nobody else seems bothered by is the fact that it cooks unevenly bottom-to-top. This is a very basic design flaw: heat rises and the spacing of the heating elements should increase bottom-to-top to compensate. Rocket science this is not! Oh, and BTW, if you touch the metal surround of the heating elements, you'll find it far from ""Cool"". In short, avoid at all costs."
5,Exelent!,"If you havn't read jude watsons books, you are missing something. These books keep getting better and better! For those of you who have read #10, this is even better. Its much more exiting. This is a must read book. This is the best star wars book there is. A super ending. Just awsome. May the force be with you."
4,Deadly Delightful,"After a relatively weak performance in The Shattered Peace, Jude Watson returns to form with The Deadly Hunter. An old friend of Qui-Gon's is being stalked by a vicious bounty hunter, and our Jedi heroes find themselves outmatched and outwitted at nearly every turn. After a climactic battle in the snow, The Deadly Hunter ends on a cliff-hanger to rival any that has come before.As usual, Watson is at her best in showing the dynamic between Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Ironically, young Obi-Wan looks down his nose at the cafe dive Qui-Gon's friend owns. It's a pity Watson didn't know about Dexter's dive when writing this one."
5,The Deadly Hunter,"Obi-Wan and Qui Gon have just returned from a long journey and Qui Gon wants to go and visit one of his old friends. When they find his friend Didi, he tells them of his trouble with a mysterious bounty hunter. Qui Gon wants to help his friend, but Obi-Wan doesn't approve of it because the Jedi Council has not given them this mission. When they go and meet the bounty hunter, they are not greeted with a warm welcome. They are both suprised of how well of a bounty hunter that she is. Obi-Wan and Qui Gon are now the mysterious bounty hunter's targets so they have to defend themselves as well as Didi and his daughter. This a must read if you are a Star Wars fan!!"
4,Pokemon leaf green and fire red,"This sounds like a good game so far. I have been a fan since pokemon hit America and I still like it. People think that long time gamers like me who have completed EVERY game, caught every pokemon and stuff like that might not like the game but I think they are wrong. In my opinion this game is going to be great and I would advise everyone to get it. Plus it is bundled with a wireless ""link cable"". Also I think this saying fits ""once a pokemon fan always a pokemon fan"". I dont care how old you are."
5,Dream has come true,"My son Danyal was telling the other day, his dream has come true after receiving the wonderful pokemon games from Amazon. Thanks"
3,Basically a rental title,"I rented this once at gamefly(like netflix, only you rent games), and when I rented this title, I thought I was in for a surprise. But all it is is a remake of blue and red. Although I played a decent amount of hours, the new islands of new pokemon give the game a little better replay value."
4,entering a better past,wow! this game is like taking a time machine to a better past.but its also like entering the future because of that adapter.you could go pretty far with that thing.and pokemon leaf green has islands you have never seen I dont have it yet but i cant wait till september 7.I think I will get it for sure! and whoever thinks this game is gonna be for losers well your totally wrong. this game will be 100% fun I know it.
4,here we go agen?,"pokemon red, blue, yellow, silver, gold, cristal, saphier, and ruby. have all been one of the best game i have ever tried. but now there is two new virsions. leaf green, and red fire. this meas only one thing i'll have to do this all over agen and, and, well.... it mite not be bad after all i did beat the rest of them but now rest dont realy mater because now there are two new virsions wha t a kid to do at a time like this?...... wait i know what to do catch and beat those game"
3,Same as red and blue,This is ok. Its like red and blue with ruby and sapphire graphics. not worth 35 bucks
5,"A ""must own"" album.","This album is easily Lloyd Cole's best work. Every track is special. I've been listening to this one for 15 years or thereabouts, and 6 or 7 of the songs have been my favourite at different stages(the title-track being the most recent). The sound world these songs inhabit is a remarkable mix of rock, blues, folk, country and pop. Lyrically too, Cole is in top form, from the playful, throw-away lines of ""My Bag"" and ""Sean Penn Blues"", to the truly haunting ""Big Snake"". An absolute must listen for friends and strangers alike."
5,love it,"A must, the album takes you for a ride and drives you into another world, a must, Rusty song is a classic"
3,"Decent set, poor sound","The Good: Pretty decent selection of tunes from the Golden Age. (But where's Sing, Sing, Sing?). The Bad: Apparently an English import. I have several other box sets of other music put out from companies across the pond (mostly blues), and they are labors of love, with a lot of effort put into cleaning up the sound and making ancient recordings sparkle. This is not the case here. It sounds like maybe a filter was applied to take off some of the higher pitched hiss or artifacts, but little else was done. Thus, the entire set sounds somewhat muffled and muddy with a lack of clarity and sparkle. This just seems like laziness when so many others are doing great things with historic recordings these days. So: affordable, decent selection of songs, but unsatisfactory sound."
5,Safe surfing for life?,"I bought this software as I was getting more and more worried about the threat of viruses infecting my home PC. My workplace has always used McAfee and I had always found it very easy to use and we have had no problems with viruses so far. So I invested in McAfee at home. After a few niggles installing the Virus Scan and the Firewall Plus I must say I am very pleased. The software runs quietly on my PC, only alerting me if anything suspicious happens and the Firewall blocks tens of events entering my PC everyday. The Security Center has a full analysis of what exactly has been blocked from your PC so you can investigate further if you wish. If you value your PC, like me, you really do need to protect it and this software is a good place to start."
1,Works until your run into a problem.,"I would give them 0 stars if it weren't because I don't have that choice.I got their yearly subscription and used the product for more than a year without any major problem, except for minor annoyances.Since the past week I am not able to verify my subscription because of a bug in their ""subscription verify system"".The worst part is that their technical support is clueless and they will ask customers to do manual uninstalls and play around with the registry, which is really scary.At this point I am considering removing the product, cancelling my subscription, and moving to another virus scanner and personal firewall.Too bad that McAffee does not provide a better customer support, and for basic and necessary products such a virus scanner and firewall they should pay more attention , just having a chat support and a forum is not good enough if they are no effective. I don't think the paying service would help either."
5,Great,Awesome!!!! My son loves Dragon Ball Z. He was happy to receive a full season of the show for Christmas!!!
5,Awesome,My favorite DBZ saga. Ever. The only thing that got annoying with this series are the several second long shorts that play half way through each episode.
5,Loved it!,"I absolutely adore this series, so to find this on Amazon was a dream come true! Action packed, fast paced, well drawn animation will keep you on the edge of your seat. Definitely worth the buy!"
1,To those who have not seen this: All These Reviews Have Spoilers.,"Believe it or not, there are some people who have not seen this yet. If you're one of them, don't read any other reviews. I gave it a one-star, only to get the attention of the those who've not seen this yet."
5,THIS SHOW IS AWESOME,I just got this about 20 min ago. i went to wal mart at midnight and picked it up. its really good
5,=],"I love this show! It's my favorite! This season was a good one, it had it all.. humor, sadness, action, happiness, but that's true with all DBZ in my book. I got to know the characters more.. This is worth buying, definately."
3,Dragon Ball,IS great but the SUbtitles Are really bad !! You need to sincronize the subtitles with the voice !
2,Dragonball Z-Season Six,The dvd is excellent but the only problem is that they changed the music from the original version and that is what makes is a mess. Other than that I would give it five stars but with the change of the audio it throws the whole thing off.
1,"Item never received but billed for, Cancelled payment",Dragonball Z season 6 was never received but billed for and promised delivery no later than Dec 4. This company did not respond to my emails prior to my canceling the payment
4,Great music from a popular Italian band,"I took a chance on this CD. I saw the video for ""In Paradisio Con Te"" in a Italian cafe and asked the bartender about the band. They've been around since the early 80's, and this disc is their current effort. The vocalist reminds me of Peter Gabriel, and there are elements of Genesis, 80's rock, and multi-cultural influences as well. It's very nicely played and although my Italian is pretty weak, the songs convey a lot of feeling. These guys are great musicians and I may have to investigate their back catalog. If you like ""Lamb Lies Down..."" era Genesis, or if you enjoy Peter Gabriel's ""Secret World"", this would be a good addition to your collection."
4,"Slightly dated, but great info",Great starting point to writing a business plan. Took a class along with the book. I would recommend getting some supplemental information as well. Check out www.schuylersilva.com
5,The Only Guide To Use,I have tried to find other how-to-books on business plan writing but no other gives you the concise step-by-step instructions this one does. I have written plans for others as well as myself using this book. $$$ have been raised and compliments have been received on the no nonsense approach to business plan writing. I have used this book for over 15 years and have given them to others to use.
4,Great advice on writing winning plans but getting outdated.,This book was great at giving the investor's angle on what a winning plan should and shouldn't include. It will almost definitely make an existing plan better and guide you toward a great plan if you're just starting (as I was). Be careful of the opinions about financing liklihood based on it's prescribed ranking system. The book was first written in 1985 and the venture captial world today bears little resemblance. The book is outdatedly bearish on startup financing.
5,"Great info, good read.",Neither a textbook not a novel but very well organized common (and not so common) sense advice how to prepare a winning business plan. I used the book while I wrote one myself and I couldn't finish reading - every few pages or so I returned to my PC and edited my business plan which I believe now has better chances for success thanks to Mr. Rich.
2,Sin chispa,"La música brasilera es chispeante, entretenida, ágil, sean sambas o bossa, tonadas tristes o alegres. Soy seguidor de Chico Buarque; me gustan canciones como ""A Banda"", ""Vai Passar"" y ""Cotidiano"". Pero en este CD doble pasa algo: me aburrió terriblemente. Lo tengo hace dos años y todavía no puedo escuchar ¡un disco entero! de una vez. La voz suena lacónica y sin energía, monótona. La banda, también, sin ese típico ""sabor"" de la música brasilera. Incluso, grandes canciones como ""Quem te viu, quem te ve"" aparecen deslucidas. Fue una mala compra. Mejor ir al Chico de los viejos tiempos."
1,Not what one may expect.,Two CD's only for the followers (and family) of Chico Buarque. Not what must lovers of Brazilian music expect. The voice gets to be annoying after the second song......not to mention most of the arrangements. I am returning these CDs.
3,"Good book, good methodology but poor CD Tutor design","While I'm pleased with the methodology, the quality of the book and the exercises, I'm disappointed with the CDROM Tutor application. The user interface design is very poor and unintuitive. Certain sound files are corrupted since clicking them results in an error message (""computer memory is full""). As a result, pronounciation is unavailable for those characters. At the lowest level, the application must also be poorly coded since it constantly consumes 98% CPU power on a powerful PC. In this day and age, the application ought to be browser-based. I recommend that the author overhaul the application and port it to a new technology."
1,Not compatable with Windows 7,"The products description states ""System Requirements: Windows 95 or higher"". Unfortunately, the included CD-ROM does not work with Windows 7. I tried it on 2 different computers."
5,Aussie's best kept secret...you MUST get this CD!,"I lived in Australia from 90-97, and had never heard of Chisel till I moved there. And what a pleasant shock it was when I found myself hearing this very CD (my first taste o'Chisel) and singing/stomping along on the first 'spin'. This band is the essence of Oz - raw power and emotion with simply great tunes to back them. Why this band never made it HUGE in the US is beyond me...but heck, forget that and get this CD for an unprecedented treat GREAT music (esp for parties). Barnesy and Mossy are one of the best songwriting teams ever! I have since gone back and bought everything this band has done to make sure I didn't 'miss a beat'!"
5,This is the album we had to have...,"The perfect album to get drunk and sing along to. The sad fact is that much of Australia's youth today does not even know the words to Khe Sanh. I am a teenage girl so I know. This shocking situation must be remedied...I recommend mass distribution of ""Chisel (Best of)"". This CD contains many of the hits of one of Australia's most popular bands of the 70s and 80s. Unlike many of their contemporaries, Chisel's songs have stood the test of time and are still heard daily on the radio. As Molly Meldrum would say, do yourself a favour. Buy this album! My only criticism is that it doesn't include ""Ita"", one of my fave Chisel songs. You'll have to pick up ""East"" for that classic."
3,Jimmy Barnes shines,"I really like Jimmy Barnes' vocals. That said, Cold Chisel is one of my favorites. I have to admit I like Jimmy Barnes' solo material far better but the voice makes this CD worthwhile."
5,A Distinctly Australian Take On American Blues-Rock And R&B-Rock,"Cold Chisel's music is an impressive take on American blues-rock and R&B-rock. The band sounds sort of like an Australian Grand Funk Railroad, and vocalist Jimmy Barnes is a Down Under version of Bob Seger. The songs often search for answers to hard-to-ask questions, and even when the band is singing about good times, there's a strong sense that rashness will lead to ruin. This undertone, which runs through all of the songs and comes to the fore on several, inspires me to look at photos of various TV and movie hotties as a deterrent to self-indulgent behavior. The core members' belief that the young Australian tourist convicted in Indonesia last spring for drug-smuggling was the victim of a grave injustice makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
3,Overrated,"With all due respect to Aussies who were young when this band was hot, as an objective listener without the historical/emotional baggage I have to say that this stuff here ain't so hot. Supposed Bob Seeger joined a band which was half Huey Lewis' News and half Little River Band. You'd have something, but you wouldn't have a whole lot more than a nice, highly talented, polished up bar band. Nothing awful but nothing great."
2,Australian nostalgia,I was told by my friends in Australia the last song on this album is like Free Bird is for us. I don't get it. It is just another '80's rock and roll band. Nothing memorable
1,Not a good idea,"Having quotes is never as good as having the whole speeches because it does not have the power of story telling no matter how good the quotes are.The best book so far on graduation speeches is ""Graduation Moments."""
3,"Not a primer on care, but good research tool","I bought this book in preparation for the arrival of our Basset pup, and found that I could have used it more effectively during the research stage. This book offers an in-depth examination of the history of the Basset Hound, and gives great detail on American kennels that have excelled in producing show Bassets, tracking Bassets and field-trial Bassets. Be aware, however, that this book is expensive, and offers a minimum of information on Basset feeding, grooming, and other care issues. This book includes beautiful examples of excellent breed-standard dogs, and makes a fine research tool for any individual who wants to get serious about Basset breeding and/or showing."
5,Book Review,"This book is a must, in my opinion, for all serious breeders of the Basset Hound. The reviews of kennels and breeders of the past and present are of inestimable value in searching and studying pedigrees. Mr. Booth also injects health and conformation comments that are pertinent to the kennel being reviewed. This is the third copy of this book that I have purchased as I give them to new breeders that I am mentoring. In my opinion its value is inestimable."
5,King Of The Funk !!!,"I picked this album up a while back, not knowing what I was in for. At first listen it just washed over me and by the time the album came to the end, nothing really stuck in my mind. A few listens later and the album is in constant rotation in my CD player (often with the track 'Cosmic Echoes' just repeating over and over again!) It's comparable to, say, Saint Germain, Llorca or any other recent French 'jazz-house' album, but Mark towers above all his contemporaries partially because his music really is jazz music composed with real instruments. It has all the expected synths, scratches and programmed drum patterns too, but as a whole it stands up as a live sounding jazz album. There are no fillers on the album either -- although Melodious Funk could probably have done without Kiwi rapper King Kapishi's heavily NZ accented verses. To summerise, 'Six Degrees' is a superior collection of summery mood music definately worth the time and money."
2,wrong picture,"the grill is NOT what the picture shows! Picture showes a ""ford"" emblem and the actual grill does not have a emblem, just aluminum bars!"
5,Their Best,"My God, my God. ""One White Duck"". ""Cold Wind To Valhalla"". ""Baker Street Muse"". ""Black Satin Dancer"". All this, AND the colossal title track, on one skinny li'l cd. Quick, go buy this. Hurry up; I'll hold your seat while you're gone."
5,Here's a quandary...,"You know, I have this album and i was just looking around here on amazon for more Tull to put on my wish list. I was very suprized to see that so many people loved this album as much as i do, because when you listen to it, it really isn't a typical album for Tull to make. And if you were to visit Jethro Tull's website, they (the band) say it is one of their LEAST favorite albums. HOW IRONIC! I think we are ALL glad they put it out, even if they were unhappy with it. If you like tull, GET THIS! Trust me here on this one."
3,This is NOT a B-52 Stratofortress!!!,"Like the title states, this is not a B-52 Stratofortress. It is a B-29 Superfortress. It will not perform a slow taxi, the lowest speed would be a high speed taxi (scaled 100+ mph). The B-52 uses drop-down engine pods under the wings, each pod housing twin turbine engines, so it's an 8-engine bomber, not a 4-engine, mid-wing mounted prop plane. This IS a good price for the plane, but it's not for the inexperienced. It does not have rudder, elevator, or aleron control, it steers using the differentiating prop control."
3,Comffy shoes but is it worth the extra money?,"I like these shoes a lot but are they really worth almost a $100 more than the sketchers I bought a year earlier. As soon as you put them on you can feel the extra cushioning but would say cushioning insoles be just as effective and cheaper to boot? I guess it is one's individual preference. Me, I wish now I had just purchased another pair of Sketchers and bought some Dr. Scholl's insoles. Only time will tell if these outlast my last pair of boots and if so than that will be another plus."
2,Cool period and actors. Not so great film.,"Very cool document of Los Angeles in the early 1970s. Lots of cool actors, ranging from Gene Hackman to Karen Black and Harry Dean Stanton, but the pace and pursuit are sorta' lackluster in this flick."
5,"Another Place, Another Time","It may seem strange that I would review a book that I read 5 years ago, but that is how good of a read ""Saracen Blade"" was. It is an historical novel. Although I can't say it leaves you changed in any ""profound"" way, it leaves you memories, like a great road trip that you keep thinking back to. ""Saracen Blade"" was a borrowed paperback, which I returned. I have been trying to find a copy of it ever since."
3,the popper unfastens all the time,This is a awesome looking lighter holder but after a week or so the popper just kept coming undone :( Stopped using it for fear of losing the lighter inside it.
2,"Great looking, not functional","This case was used for about 24 hours before my husband gave up on it. I bought it as part of his Christmas present along with a Harley Davidson lighter. This will not stay clipped to the belt, so it kept falling off as he was riding his motorcycle. He finally stopped using it before he lost it on the road. The design needs to be improved and the snaps need to be reinforced."
2,Button on strap...,"Ok, so I bought this thinking it would be good to have while riding and wearing chaps so I don't have to dig into my pants pocket under the chaps. Well, it has a snap belt loop that is WAY to loose. I almost lost it along with my prized zippo twice before I decided to throw it in a junk drawer and never use it again. It comes unbuttoned and falls off your belt WAY to easy. You have been warned."
3,unsatisfied,I recieved my lighter case and evewry time I sat down it comes unsnapped this product should not have a snp on the back I super glued the snap so that it can't come unsnapped now that I have superglued the snap shut I am happy with it but for future reference I suggest that you ripped the belt loop it's for your belt to slide through not to snap on it every time you bumb into something it comes unsnapped than you take the chance of loosing your $30 to $40 dollar Zippo plus your lighter pouch very poor design please re-think this and do away with the snap itsd useless
4,Thank you,"This made a great last minute gift and arrived in less than a week, since I live in North Pole Alaska this made me very happy!The only drawback is when on the belt, the snap closure on the back side comes undone when my boyfriend bends over.It looks sharp and seems well made."
4,Love the new fasTrack,We wanted a switch and siding with our train set. I like the waythe track fits and stays together.
2,not worth the money at all!!!! be aware!!!,"This musical toy is not worth it at all. It doesn't show up on the wall anything like the box says it will. You must hold it 3 inches from the ceiling to see anything that resembles the characters!!! The music is nice, but the projection really sucks. Called the company to complain and they did nothing about it, said the product was discontinued!!! DON""T WASTE your MONEY$$$$$$$$"
2,Not quite VERY GOOD,"The company was great about sending it; it came very quickly. The story is one of our family favorites and that hasn't changed. The illustrations are gorgeous and the story is one that truly reminds you of how childhood should be. The only disappointment I had was the actual condition of the book. The seller said in very good condition. I think of very good condition as being a clean book, good binding, no writing. This book had names written in the front, crayon scribbled in the back and the bottom of the binding was peeling. This book is no longer in print so I knew a used copy was my only choice but I would liked to know it was in good or fair condition before ordering."
5,The best book for preparing for a new baby,"We've got a second child on the way, and I have 7 books on the subject for my two year old daughter. This is far and away the best one. She loves it, and the level of detail is perfect for her. The other good ones we have are Joanna Cole's ""The New Baby at Your House"" (talks a lot about positive and negative feelings an older sibling has about a new baby) and ""I'm a Big Sister"" (short and sweet, just an introduction to being a big sibling.)"
5,A great book for siblings 4 and older,"We got this book for our nearly 5 year old in preparation for the birth of his baby sister. The book does a great job covering the pregnancy, birth and family transitions after the new arrival. There's also a neat chart, showing the development of the fetus, which can easily be glossed over for younger kids or covered in more detail for older kids. The book also covers breastfeeding, which we really appreciated since it can be a little difficult for siblings to be reminded of the one special bonding activity they engaged in as babies. The book opens the door to having great conversations about the upcoming birth and changes."
5,A lovely book.,"Sometimes when shopping for childrens' books online, it's hard to know what a book will really be like (though reviews help). This book I saw in a bookstore and I was captivated by it -- it's not sentimental or sappy but by the time I finished reading it I was extremely moved, even a bit teary. As other reviewers have noted it covers different aspects of prenatal preparations, baby growth, baby care, etc., but it also manages very subtly to encompass some of the emotions (in parents as well as siblings) around the arrival of a new baby. It has a somewhat larger format and wonderfully simple yet expressive illustrations. My son (who just turned four) loves it, and I think it makes him feel good about the prospect of being a big brother (the sibling in the story is a boy, but the book is written in such a way that girls would be able to relate to it, too). After all, it is the big brother who plays a pivotal role in helping to soothe the baby at the end of the story!"
2,Not for toddlers,"I purchased this book for my almost 3 year old after reading all the wonderful reviews. Now, my son loves for me to read to him. He barely sat still through the first few pages. This book is full of great information, but not for a toddler/preschooler. It is very wordy and goes in depth way too much. I also purchased a new sibling book by Dr. Sears at the same time and my son loves that one. I will say the one pro to this book is that is shows breastfeeding. Other than that, it looks like this book will just sit on a shelf and collect dust. Such a waste of money."
5,"Our favorite ""baby is coming"" book","Our 2 1/2 year old didn't understand when we talked about a baby sister, so we bought three books about new babies. This one is our favorite and his. First, the little boy has toys just like he does, so he identifies with him. Second, it has great pictures of baby eating, playing, crying, and sleeping, all of which he understands when we explain it. Third, it has the preparation story that we really wanted - mommy and son visiting the doctor, son hearing the baby's heartbeat, and most importantly, baby in mommy's tummy. He seems to understand what we mean now when we talk about the baby being in mommy's tummy (he used to say, ""I have a baby in my tummy too!"", but now talks about mommy's tummy having such a big baby).We are very happily surprised that he understands so much more, and is better prepared for what will be happening soon for our family. And he asks to read it all the time!"
5,just a great book!,Our son loves this book and wants to read it everyday! we are expecting #2 is a month or so and I really think this book has prepared him and i think (hope) that he is looking forward to having his own baby. The pictures are so realistic and he just gets enthrauled by them.
3,a bit complicated for a 2 year old,"this is a neat book, but way too in-depth for our 2 year old. we were searching for good books to help him understand what to expect with our new baby coming. i recommend this one for older kids (4+)."
3,Okay choice for a new sibling,My son is 2 1/2 and I felt this book was a little more graphic than I would have liked for his age. I know this manufacture states for 4+ but I would have kept it if the illustrations were different because he did understand the context just fine and seemed to enjoy it.
3,Its ok,Not really a great book for my 2 year old. There is too much writing and the pages are really flimsy. It would be a great book for an older child.
3,Dated,"This is a dated but useful volume that would be great for research but is not what you'd want to just pick up and read. Prose is stilted, not all that authoritative."
3,Flawed but very interesting,"There's a goofy charm to this film. It doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, but instead of ending up a mess, it manages to maintain a good pace, a comprehensible storyline and more-than-adequate character development. A good, occasionally noir soundtrack evens the whole thing out nicely. The boys - Lance Henriksen in particular - seem to be having a good time; unfortunately Molly Ringwald doesn't ever seem to catch on, but that's okay 'cause she turns in a reasonable if somewhat lower-key performance than her male co-stars. Flawed but interesting. Absolutely worth the time."
3,EIGHT LEGGED FREAK,"OCTOPUS 2 is a sequel that isn't a sequel; it has nothing to do with the original, and nothing is ever really said that indicates how this puppy got so big...but, as a run of the mill creature feature, it has its moments. I liked the rapport between partners Walter and Nick (Frederic Lane and Michael Reilly Burke), but found Walter's exit too quick; he had a nice panache the movie never returned. The effects are average; nothing startling, although the decapitation of the Statue of Liberty in a dream sequence was quite cool. The extended rescue of the kids on the bus (after the octopus' demise) was too long and anticlimactic. Not a horrible movie, but it won't make us forget JAWS!"
2,What were they thinking?,"I have to say, this is by far, one of the worst sea creature movies I have seen. I didn't even bother to rent it, I watched it on Scifi. It looked exciting, but I was wrong. The Octopus itself hardly moved at all. Its tentacles were the ones that did the moving. Even if the theory of the movie was right, the octopus being swept from the sea, that would've been wrong if it killed people because Octopuses aregentle creatures and do not grow to enormous sizes. Even the first Octopus made more sense and was a lot more exciting. The only reason why I give it two stars is for the acting. Otherwise this below sea level bugdet film is a stinker."
1,"Boring, Boring and more Boring!!!","What were they thinking, after the not so bad original they create this crap. I usually love giant animals on the attack movies, even fake looking ones but this is at the bottom of the barrel. When I got this I figured the Octopus is smaller than its giant counterpart so I was hoping for some really gruesome kills but instead I got ridiculously long attacks where the characters survive and all it is, is the rubber tentacles wrapping around them. I don't sense any pain or fear. This octopus just pops up from nowhere and attacks and usually fails. What made this even more stupid is the crappy acting and the focus on the Police characters, it hardly has anything to do with the less threatening Octopus. Boring and crappy, avoid it at all cost. Trust me I'm a person who likes Cemetery Gates so believe me, this is horrible"
3,Jaws in newyork,"This is the sequel to the original. It takes place in a populated area out in new york harbor. Instead out of in the middle of no where. There is a lot of gory not not a lot of action until the very end of the movie. In this movie another mutated octupus enters the Harbor of New York and the killings start again. This was not as interesting because only about a 1/3 to half the movie takes place in the water. The main charaters are normal every day people there are no terrorists or millitary people or secret goverment aggents in this one like there were in the orignal made a year earlier. If you like this movie I recommend you see the other horror movies made by lion gate Octopus. Crocodile 2 Death Swamp, Spider 2 and Frality."
2,"Good sound, then the amp broke","Like a lot of other people I've seen, my amplifier just stopped working one day. Occasionally it will kick back in, but its pretty rare. They were good speakers for the 2 years i had them, but then just died."
4,"Great for the money, does what it says","I got this because it takes optical input, and my DVD player provides optical audio output; using this I could listento music CDs with the TV off and also it provides better sound than the TV speakers for DVD movies.It performs these functions pretty well. The speakers are smalland a little tinny. Obviously this setup is inferior to a home audio system with real speakers, and for DVDs you still don't get the real theatre experience. But it is a clear improvement over just using your TV's audio.And the price is good.The quality will disappoint audiophiles, but for the rest of us it's a good purchase if it fits your needs. (Check the tech specs of this product and your audio device (DVD, PC, etc.) to make sure they match up first.)"
1,Rebate Fraud Warning,Please be aware that Yamaha failed to honor my rebate claiming the postmark had been received Jan 3 2003. This would mean that the rebate took more than 3 weeks to be delivered. I smell fraudulent practices. Count me in on a class action suit.
5,Great boom for your buck,"About a year ago I bought a Cambridge Soundworks desktop system very similiar to this one. It a larger center channel and a little higher quality speakers. I was looking for a second similiar system for a small room for at college when I came across this one. I was a little skeptical with the price, but after listening to it I was very impressed. At low and medium levels of the volume it sounds almost identical to my Cambridge system. When turned up to very high or maxed out I could tell a little difference, but not much. For the price it is an absolute incredible deal, I got 2 of my friends to buy it already just after hearing it for 15 minutes. If you are looking for speakers for a small room either at home or a college I would pick this up in a heartbeat, unless you want to drop a grand, this is the best way to go. The optical connection is great to plug in a dvd player or in my case Xbox w/ the optical convertion."
4,"It is good, could be better",The sound quality is very good. The sound is clear and loud. I connect it to a DVD player and feel satisfied with the performance. The only problem is there is no remote control.
2,Disappointing,"Bought a new computer with a Soundblaster Live!5.1 audio card, wanted a 5.1 surround sound system to replace my old trusty pair of Yamaha YST-M10s and YST-MSW5 subwoofer... Really liked the sound of my existing Yamaha setup, so leaned toward Yamaha to replace them. The press reviews favorably reviewed the clear high end sound I like, with some mumblings about inadequate sound depth.The system is nicely designed, and its quality is in line with its price. With the new sound card, the highs were nice and clear, the bass adequate, if a bit muddy, and the midrange sound was thin and raspy. I had to continuously tweak on the graphic eqalizer to get satisfactory sound... was just too much work to make it sound good... I think the satellite speakers are too small to bridge the gap with the relatively large subwoofer."
2,"Maybe OK for games, but too tinny for anything else","I bought this set to replace some rather large speakers I was using with my amp/receiver into which I feed my tv and DVD sound. Maybe if I had just TV speakers before this would sound good, but when I switch back between what I had (Big & good) to this (Small and tinny), I just can't make the move. I was planning on using them for my upcoming purchase of an HDTV, but I guess I will need to buy something better (and more expensive) because the quality of the sound is not very good compared to a 'hi-fi' set-up.Bottom line. too tinny.. the speakers are probably just too small to deliver decent midrange."
5,BEST OF ROUTE 66,"I'll keep it simple and to the point. Every episode has a little known guest star that became big, except for one special episode. The producers paid an omage to the classic Universal Horror films by writing an episode for Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney,Jr., and Peter Lorre at the end of their careers playing themselves and allowing Chaney to dress up in his most famous monsters including ""The Wolfman"". Just for that episode its worth its wait in gold."
1,Won't play,"I bought this DVD for my sister for Christmas and only recently found out it won't play. It gets stuck on the ""infinity"" insignia. A total bust."
4,Chippewan Boots,"I really like the boots but unfortunately I had to return them because I need a larger size. I shipped them out today and can,t wait to get the new ones."
2,"It's just ""ok!""","When I purchased this utility cart I bought it as the reviews stated how durable/sturdy it is, but, what I received is warped. I've seen sturdier carts. I also purchased it as the picture showed it was a white/off-white color and that color worked for the area I am using it in. Instead, it is a an unsightly dark blue-grey color...like the old tool box colors. I will use it until I find what I want and then this will go to the garage or salvation army. One viewer stated that they bought it for their elderly mother and the mother uses a walker and when she goes to the garage to bring things back into the house, she uses this cart and it doubles as a walker and cart. I WOULD NOT ADVISE THAT! It looks better in the picture. Being warped I don't see it holding 300 lbs per shelf!"
1,Utility cart,"The cart was received with 2 small dents in the tray folds it looks like the package was opened and resealed.It's a utility cart so I'll keep it but I was not satisfied,Amazonas"

4,Gift,"Gave this one to my aunt for Christmas. Haven't had any negative feedback on it so far, so much have been a good choice."
4,warning,"Do not listen to the information in the previous review. It is terrible information. Most OEM decks and factory speakers are 2 ohm, NOT 4 ohm. You do not risk damaging anything using these without an amp or with a factory head unit. Just wanted to clear that up."
3,Okay sound,"Not as good as I hoped only a marginal improvement over the factory speakers. Good for mid range sound, and acceptable sound quality for the low and high notes.Infinity Kappa 692.7i 6""x9"" 2-way car speakers"

2,huggies mango coconut aloe lotion,love the smell and feel of lotion on my girls it is so goood i use it myself. a little goes along way
2,Decent supplies. Cheap case,"Not at all what I expected. The supplies are okay except the plastic scissors. I was expecting a nice case though, but on the inside it's just really thin plastic that will wear and tear very fast. Also, every time you open the case, you then have to open up the thin plastic to get to the supplies."
3,"Nice idea, not durable","I got this for my 6 year old son, who loves to color and draw, after he saw it at a store. I liked the idea of him having a case to carry his art supplies. Unfortunately, when it arrived, the handle was already broken. Not long after we got it, one of the hinges broke. As mentioned by another reviewer, the supplies are held in the case with cheap thin molded plastic that quickly gets torn and warped. This liner also doesn't stay put on the respective sides of the case, so after closing the case, you have to reset the liner on each side. The markers are of good quality. The pencils are decent, but short and often the lead breaks easily. The oil pastels are poor."
1,Cheap and not worth the price,"I purchased this kit because Alex usually makes good quality toys, but I was totatlly disappointed with this product. The glue was dry and the plastic scissors didn't even work. The cheap plastic interior, holding in all the arts supplies, will break in a matter of days. Alex should issue a refund, in full, to all those who purchased this product. DO NOT purchase!!!"
2,Not oil pastels,"We got two sets of these for our kids for Christmas, knowing that the Alex brand has a great reputation - I was really disappointed to find that the oil pastels are actually just plain old wax crayons and they don't actually color very well - the colors are weak and insipid.Not what I would expect from Alex!"
1,Im very disapointed!,"I got this art kit for my 6 year old daughter Audree, and when we opened it, it was a mess. The handle was broken, there was a huge rip in the weak, and very thin plastic case, and the crayons really didn't have any color. The markers ran out really fast and the pencils were short and not very decent to use. We didn't like the oil pastels because they were very poor and weak.We do not recommend this item, especially with this expensive price range"
1,"Orig ""Planet of Apes"" Did the Statue of Liberty Thing Better","This is petty, but the Statue of Liberty is not only facing the wrong direction on the cover of the DVD (and in the movie), it's now apparently located in the East River. I know this was a fantasy movie and you have to let reality slip a little, but moving one of the world's most recognized landmarks, (presumably to avoid views of the World Trade Center site) is kind of lame.Oh yeah - the movie itself blew chunks. Wait until it comes out on HBO, and then watch something else instead."
1,"Predictable, corny, and just plain terrible","The special effects in the movie are amazing in the first half of the film. It's just your standard disaster film (except with better effects) in the first half. However, after the storm destroys New York City, it is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. I actually considered walking out in the middle. There are basically no special effects in the second half, and also, the dialouge is so auful it actually is funny. To top it off, the second half is more farfeched than the rest of the movie. Dennis Quaid walks from Washington D.C. to New York in a few days, which would be rediculous anyway but it's in the worst storm in history. Also, they just happen to run into WOLVES when they try to get medicine for the girl. COME ON! Only watch this movie if you like unintentional comedy a lot."
1,Don't think during this film,"I saw it for speical effect but the story is a 1000 flaws. Some are do dumb that I stayed to watch the retarded ending with is 'always blame America'. A horric cold spell happens that freeze people and machines in seconds yet wolves fun around like it is 40 degrees. The classic flaw is when the father (completely forgot his name) actually walks from Washington DC and finds his son in the main library. And, for politically correntness, there is a homeless black guy that just pumping out ghetto wisdom that saves the day. The klutz who is clearly Dick Chaney repeats of his ways and thanks Mexico for illegal immigrantion."
1,lame,"I'll go see a movie just for some nice effects or explosions or gun fights, or the destruction of a city.Which The Day After Tomorrow is.But, there are no nice effects. People say, 'oh it has wonderful SFX, it's so realistic, u have to see it cause of the FX' etc etc.But the effects suck. THey SUCK! They look cartoonish and oh so pasted in.And I'm not even gonna start on how sucky the acting and plot is."
1,Bad customers service,received the movie with out a case. seems to be a reoccuring problem with you guys. if you sell it that way you should say so. i will NOT use you again!
1,Oh man! Sentimental drivel again.,"What the hell is wrong with you american movie makers???Romance in a movie about global catastrophy. I mean, come on people! Why do you alweays have to have love in your movies? Is it really what people want?A good movie toutches your emotions, or at least is should. I felt nothing. Nothing!And what about them wolves? Nah, i'm not even gonna comment that...If it was possible to rate the movie with zero stars, that would have been my choise. Now I give it one star and that will represent the issue with how we treat the globe. That must come to an end."
5,Just Grand!,I always enjoy watching this movie over and over again. This movie makes you think about what we as a whole have done to the atmosphere due to our selfish ways.
1,Amazed at it's stupidity,This movie was too stupid and unrealistic to enjoy. That's all I have to say.
5,This is the greatest movie!,"<a href="" http://www.m80teams.com/?TDoxMTcx"">This movie had a great plot, Jake Gylenhaal is a definitely fantastic actor who I enjoyed watching. I really was happy with the ending, it was a good ending and satisfying."
2,Frozen Numb With Disappointment...!!!,"The ""sold-out"" theater audience was numb struck with disappointment by the end. To make this movie a HIT: relocate the amazing computer-generated disasters to a different city other than New York, replace the story line and characters with the ""Shrek-2"" crew, loose the overly-fake wolves, and get George Lucas (Star Wars) or Luc Besson (The Fifth Element) to direct it."
2,"Great effects, AWFUL cast","Three reasons to not see the movie are 1)Jake Gyllenhall,2)Sella Ward, and 3) Randy Quaid. Im not sure I spelled their names correctly- but do I care? Absolutely NOT. All 3 actors are horrible. Theyve got as much depth as actors, as President Bush actually doing a good job running our country. As for the movie itself? The story is as bad as the actors. The only positive thing I can say about the movie are the special effects. They're great! Very realistic. So if theres any reason to watch this movie, watch it for the special effects. But if your expecting good actors and a good story, you'll surely be disappointed."
3,oh boy,The special effects used for this movie was top notch. Very believable! The lines were soupy and predictable. All in all I'd watch again just to see the special effects!
3,"Not Great, Not Bad, just good B- Fun !","Great Special effects, tense situations, Ok acting, It's nothing more than a good summer blockbuster. Although it is highely entertaining, it still lacks in just one thing....... Acting. The acting was C+ material, but it could have been A- material. This is nothing more than a desent rental."
3,This movie is better than it's reputation...,"I thought it was pretty good even though it's unintentionally fictional, ..I didn't care. Some of the best movies have little to no truth to them. The special effects looked darn good to me, I don't understand why some have said otherwise. I won't be surprised if the Academy Awards take notice as well, the F/X are that good. The one thing that I didn't understand was how the father (Dennis Quaid) got from California to New York so quickly, I would have liked the journey to reach his son (Jake Gyllenhaal) to be more adventurous. I mean he drove in a car some of the way, then was forced to walk a portion of the way as well. It would have been more rewarding to the audience if we got to witness the pain and hardship of such a difficult rescue, for all the survival that took place there wasn't a real hero to give the credit to. Still in all the movie doesn't deserve it's bad reputation. 3 stars = pretty good."
2,Not very special,"After the special effects, the rest of the movie, like a blizzard, gets bogged down. The world moves slow but incredibly, our heroes walk 40 miles through the worst storm ever to save the day."
1,Science Takes a Vacation,This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever paid money to see. It is supposed to be a disaster/thriller but ends up being a comedy the script writing is that bad and plot so unbelievable. The only scary part of the movie is that some people will actually take it seriously. I was expecting to see a bad movie with spectacular special effects and that's what it is. I just wasn't expecting it to be so totally unbelievable where science and basic physics take a vacation for 2 hours.Highlights: The theater applauded when L.A. was destroyed by tornadoes. The theater broke out into uncontrolable laughter with the reverse immigration across the border from the U.S. into Mexico.
1,"Watch this movie the day after ""never""","The science is deplorable and the acting is worse. If the world should end the day after tomorrow, and you haven't yet seen this movie, consider yourself lucky!"
2,Fell asleep while watching and woke up the day after.,"Thankfully I didn't sleep until the day after tomorrow. I watched - or tried to watch anyway - this big budget piece of environmentalist propaganda because it had reached the ""everyone has seen it but me"" kind of critical mass so that I was compelled to see it just so I can say I had.I loved the opening scene when the driller guy is standing there while a huge crack formes in an ice shelf and ends up separating him from his colleagues. This was just like an ""Ice Age"" movie, but with a human and his ice cores rather than a squirrel and an acorn. But it was downhill from there on. The problem wasn't that I'm a bit skeptical of the whole global warming thing (at least the part where humans did it and humans can fix it) but rather that I found the characters so dull. Spectacular effects cannot make up for boring characters, at least not for me. So, I'll be returning this movie to where I rented it from today, not the day after tomorrow."
1,Atrocious... silliest movie since 'Armageddon',"This one is so politically correct they even recycled the plot. If the director had spent as much time developing the story as he did on the special effects, it might have been worth more than one star. As it is, I'd have given it zero, but that's not an option here.I haven't laughed so much at a disaster flick since ""Armageddon""."
1,"Movie okay, but DVD lacks extras...","I was really looking forward to see the extras that the label promises. The label indicates that there is over an hour of ""making of"" featurettes. Do not believe it. What it has is a bunch of links to featurettes that take hours to download. Until we have multi-gigabit-per-second pipes to the home (which means Internet connections over 1000 times faster than DSL or cable), the so-called DVD-ROM extras are useless."
5,Great movie!!,"Very interesting movie. Opens your eyes about the possibilities of global warming and what the effects might be if we don't deal with this soon, instead of brushing it under the rug. I hate seeing how humanity only responds to issues and coming together to fix these issues after the fact they happen. Great movie if you haven't seen yet buy. Fantastic movie."
4,"Good video, sound is just a bit muddy","I'm not looking to review the movie since you can get tons of reviews everywhere. All I'll say is that it's a fun movie if you don't take it too seriously.The video quality of the Blu-Ray edition is really good, good enough that you don't notice it, you just feel like you're in the action. It's as good as being at the theater. The sound quality is also good, but not perfect; in places it's muddy, particularly when there's a lot of weather howling sounds. Dialogue is crisp and easy to follow, but this doesn't drive your subwoofer as much as you'd expect given the subject matter, and some of the sound just doesn't pop like you'd figure. It's not bad, it's just not as good as you'd hope."
1,I've never seen the air so clear!,"I give this one star becuase of it's special affects. I didn't like the story and the last line was the worst line in any movie i have ever seen.This movie is too unrealistic and the emotional parts weren't that emo... heck they weren't emotional at all. I felt like laughing my head off half of the time. And no i am not scared of New York freezing over and everyone going to Mexico. I felt emberassed when i left the theatre becuase i had gone and seen some crazy environmentalist film.Oh Yeah were those wolves great special affects or what, they totally looked real!!! I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE AIR SO CLEAR."
1,Computerization gone wild,"I thought the movie would be entertaining at least...the special effects were almost too stupid to enjoy...the entire premise left me ""cold""...It may become a ""cult"" film in the future..don't waste your money.."
5,I love it!,"I absolutely loved this movie. Even though I don't think global warming is a problem, I thought the plot was interesting, and I loved the cute romance bits. The acting is amazing. The bonus features are a great plus too. I can't stop watching."
4,Good Movie,"I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes the sci-fi, ""end of the world"" type of movies. I really enjoyed it. Looks amazing on Blu-ray High Def as well."
4,Great add to any collection!,"Nothing much to say about this Blu-Ray, it looks pretty good and has good sound."
2,Great Style.... Little Substance,"This could have been a great movie. The dynamic of father and son provided an excellent chance for the writers and directors to have a truly dynamic story, but alas it failed to deliver.The special effects were awesome. If that's all you want from a movie (Giant tornadoes, snow-covered landslides and mountains of water filling the streets of coastal America) you'll be pleased with this movie.If, however, you want a plot, storyline and viable conclusion, you will be (as I was) greatly disappointed.For a movie of this type to work, you have to care about the characters. Writers and directors of the future, take note of that!"
1,I learned a lot watching this movie...,"1. An ice-age can take place in 16 days.2. An artic hurricane can freeze helicopter fuel instantly but has no effect on normal household gas.3. An experienced explorer can walk from Philadelphia to NYC in one day in the worst blizzard in history.4. The President of the US will stay in the White House until the very end to ""stay with the sinking ship"".5. Books being burnt look remarkably like wood being burnt and apparently last a long time.6. In a massive flood in NYC, unmanned oil tankers will be able to circumnavigate the flooded streets to arrive at the door of the public library.I'm sure there was a lot more I could have learned, but I was laughing too hard."
4,Quality flick. Kindly disregard reviews complaining...,"...about whether we have or have not caused harm to our planet. The movie is not heavy handed nor does it attribute much blame to any one group. It's just a good, quality disaster flick that is fun to watch. Most disaster flicks kind of suck but I've actually watched this several times and I can't say that about many movies. Sit back, relax, and enjoy. Oh, and this is best to watch on a cold day...just adds a certain ambiance that lets you associate with the characters more."
3,The Day After Tomorrow (Widescreen Edition),"Relaively fun albeit exaggerated look at the effects of global warming. The special effects were as fabulous as most modern day movies are with Dennis Quaid somehow tramping from DC to NY during a sudden ice age to rescue his son. Always a solid performer, Jake Gyllenhall makes me want to be nerdy 17 year old again. Fun disaster movie all around."
3,Truly Hilarious!,"The Day After Tomorrow is clearly a comedy being marketed as a disaster movie. The film has the appearance of being heavily edited down; for an epic, world-ending disaster, you need at least a two-hour movie.The film presents a dark look at how helpless humanity is in the big scheme of things and how our petty lives and culture mean nothing to mindless Mother Nature. Yet anyone with any iota of meteorological knowledge knows that disastrous weather does not happen this quickly. And the way water and ice behave in this movie is truly ludicrous.And what if it did happen, and just as The Day After Tomorrow portrays? What could we do against a world where the laws of nature cease to exist? The end of the world (or nearly so) is either a tragedy or a comedy. Judging from this film, it would be hilarious, indeed."
4,One of the best dissaster films ever edge of yor seat,I really enjoyed this film and remeber seeing it when it came out in the theaters. Ok it's a disaster film so the acting is not the greatest get over it. The story is scary and farfetched but edge of your seat end of the world exciting. The special effects are outstanding and the directing is great. A must see popcorn film.
1,lame,"There is something positive about in this movie. It managed to start some public conversations about the greenhouse-effect at least somewhere in the globe but the enviromental message in ""The Day After Tommorrow"" got finally buried under its stupidness. No wonder, unfortunately. This is exactly something that could have been expected from the same director who has made such rubbish as ""universal soldier"" and ""the Indepencence day"". Unlike many other foreign directors Emmerich has found his way to stay in the big budget business by adding each time some korny and sentimental patriotism in his films, often directly out from the mouth of the president himself. There`s lots of holes in the script which can`t be filled not even by the massive special effects. Maybe I`m just too old( yet still a teenager) but I just can`t get excited by stuff like some crappy animated CGI-wolfs anymore. In this context, the first pictures of the gigantic wave where quite entertaining though."
4,It Could Be Worse!,"Sure, the scenario isn't completely convincing, but the idea of a catastrophe happening overnight can't really be expected to be. At least it's entertaining, if only for a few hours. Its cheesy attempt at political relevance and overblown special effects make certain of that fact. It could be MUCH worse (Gigli, anyone?)"
2,A Thoroughly Wasted Opportunity,"I thought it was pretty weak. Even the special effects were less than awesome.The premise was great. Unfortunately, the way it unfolded was too dark and depressing. And not in a thought provoking way.No sharp insights. No real ecological/enviromental revelations. And a damn weak story line, with very little suspense. AND ABSOLUTELY NOTHING REALLY TO ROOT FOR.A big disappoint for me...and I love these sort of movies. I even very much liked ""The Core."" At least that one had some old fashioned Hollywood-type suspense."
1,I haven't seen it and neither have most of you!,"why are people reviewing this movie and giving it 4 and 5 stars when they haven't even seen it yet? For pete's sake, one of these was written in November! The movie just came out today. Who cares if you think it will be good before you've even seen it? Based on what? Your political beliefs? The trailer? Come on people, these promotion guys can make the biggest piece of crap movie look good by taking out the 2 or 3 good scenes, adding some fancy music and a dramatic voice-over. Please remove these unhelpful reviews. (Including mine after you read this!)"
3,Listened to the commentary,WEll After seeing the movie the first time I loved it. I decided to listen to the commentary. This turned the movie into a complete joke. I could care less to hear about how many times the director or writer got tanked and worked the next day. This whole movie seemed to have been CGI'd or some type of work. Not the flood and frozen parts with the statue of liberty but even the simple stuff. It was like thye spent their whole time in front of a blue screen and pasted everything else in it. Why not just go and past in the actors too? It was just a real letdown listening to the commentary. If I had heard it first I would have never bought the movie.
2,Reminded me of Independence Day...,"Then...what a shock!It's tha same g-d aweful movie!Same cliched characters, same basic plot, same dazzle special effects, just a different plot device!Geeez...it's as bad as the Airport/Towering Inferno et al. crap of the 70s.Fun visuals...though a subtitle should be ""Physics, Shmysics!"""
2,(title here) is when you take it back for a refund,"This movie is BOOO! AWEFUL! The basic plot about global warming and catastrophic climate changes is very plausible and then the movie just goes to hell in a hand basket. Just one preposterous thing after another. Fuel freezing instantaneouly at 150 degrees below zero, cold fronts with no wind, walking from Washington to New York in sub zero temperatures, medicine bottles sitting unfrozen on glass shelves in a cabinet on a freighter (rough seas?), evacuating the entire country below the Mason Dixon line to Mexico. It just goes on and on. Save your money and take a nap instead."
3,Maybe it's a spoof...,"The stars are for the special effects, otherwise this movie would get a minus rating. The dialog, plot, acting, etc., are so bad that maybe we just didn't get it - maybe this is just a parody, a spoof, of all the blockbuster disaster movies ever made. All the cool effects can't hide the fact that the plot just doesn't make sense, so maybe, in fact, everyone's tongues are actually in their cheeks. That would make a lot more sense than this movie."
1,Swoosh - cyclone in the toilet,"I usually avoid ""catastrophy"" movies and thankfully I saw this as a rental on a discount. The characters are uninteresting at best and mostly irritatingly stupid.I'd say that this movie combines two elements; catastrophy movie and a teen movie - you know those movies you didn't go near even when you actually were a teenager.Stay clear of this turkey, it's one of the worst waste and major money thrown at making a movie with an idiotic theme and a majorly irritating look and feel."
1,Oh Please...,"This is the end of the world as told through the lense of the most liberal production team in Hollywood. It comes complete with a cheesy enviromental message and corny special effects.I can't wait to see the sequel; ""The Day After Two Days From Now"" It's about when excessive airplane and SUV use knock Mars out of orbit...and send it hurdling straight toward earth. Peter O'Toole and Megan Fox star, Al Gore and Hilary Clinton direct."
2,"Breathtaking Imagery, Terrible Plot","Initially, I didn't even want to see this film. I ended up watching it late at night on pay-per-view.While watching this film, I was impressed with the images of Manhattan being flooded and everyone rushing to the public library. I thought the concept for the movie was cool, but Dennis Quaid was very unbelievable.Dialogically, this could be the worst movie I've ever seen. The script was plain awful. The lines were very plain and bland.Even worse than that, these wolves that were added to the film did not fit and were completely unneccessary.I am only giving this a 2 instead of a 1 because I thought the imagery was very enjoyable.My advice: put it on mute, and look at the awesome images."
3,2 extra stars for the special effects,"The special effects were killer... but unfortunately, it was the only thing good about the movie.The first thing I said after the conclusion of the film was, ""That could have been a lot better of a movie if it had a better cast."" The acting, while not amateur, was not up to par. I'm not so sure if it was just a horrendous storyline, or the actors failed to bring any spark to the screen. In any event, the only thing working for this movie was the terrific special effects.I didn't come away from the movie disappointed, but it could have been much, much better."
3,You'll love it because it's bad or hate it because it's bad,"This flick put me in mind of Irwin Allen's disaster movies from the 70s with its overdone plot and Disaster On An Epic scale premise. The laughable dialogue and silly twists entertain only because they're so bad. Frankly, I'd rather watch ""The Poseidon Adventure"" or ""The Towering Inferno"" because the theme songs were better, and although computer-generated special effects are de rigeur today, I still think they look cartoonish"
3,A Real Disaster Movie,"A good popcorn movie, ""Day After Tomorrow"" features eye-popping special effects and a familiar cast. Dennis Quad, looking more frozen than all the ice around him, is a scientist who warns the world that hell is about to freeze over. Great special effects ranging from tormadoes to one huge title wave, and a brisk pace keeps things moving along nicely. Forget all logic, just sit back and enjoy the ride."
4,Great Story Line!,"I absolutely loved this movie! The plot was fantastic, and it was exciting to watch it unfold. The acting was the only thing that stopped me from giving it five stars, with a few of the actors giving subpar performances.Overall, it was a very unique story and played out very well with the special effects and the political undertones. Definitely worth the money!Have fun!"
4,plausible aside,"I liked the movie and have watched it more than 10 times. I like disaster flicks. I didn't have problems with caring for the characters. No movie is perfect, dialog like in ALL movies has its moments but it is entertaining. Different than the asteroid coming to destroy the earth movies. Was a change from that."
3,There's Nothing Like a Good Disaster,"You will see a standard disaster movie, like many that have come before it. This time, global warming is the culprit. Silly me, I thought global warming would make things hot, but it cracks the polar ice cap and makes things cold, as it brings giant tornado destruction to Los Angeles, grapefruit-size hail in Tokyo, and a monster tidal wave that engulfs Manhattan. The water then freezes, turning Manhattan into an arctic place. The human action doesn't contribute much to the story, but the disaster scenes make it all worth watching, as long as you don't take any of it seriously. This is a nice movie to watch if you just want to relax."
4,Pure Eye-Candy,"And thats just fine by me. The scene where the tidal wave destroys Manhattan is enough to make up for the silly plot. Yes, I said silly. Not the event of the next global warming / ice age...thats not too rediculous...it's the father trying to save his son part that's stupid. ANYWAYS!!! Watch it for the tornadoes destroying LA and the tidalwave destroying New York and the scene with the wolves in the ship is pretty neat. The acting is sub-par...These actors have done much better elsewhere...just watch Jack in Brokeback or even Good Girl and Dennis in Far From Heaven. Anyways, like I said, the one reason to see this is for the CGI graphics and 'intence peril' as the box puts it."
3,I'm being nice here,"the special affects and all that computerized crap was honestly GOOD...although the main drawback from this film is how OVERDONE it trully is. sure i liked it in all for the ""suspense"" it gave u AT TIMES however really this couldve been made from a more realistic point of view and not some OUT OF THIS WORLD director point of view..even actual climatologists were offended by the film..well you can't blame them..."
2,Only a rental,"Special effects are good but the story line and premise is poor. Maybe an okay rental, but not worth purchasing."
2,shoddy film left me cold,"After scores of glowing reviews from Mr & Mrs Everyday Moviewatcher I decided, against my better judgement, to watch the movie. I figured, ""What could possibly go wrong with Dennis Quaid, Ian Holme and Jake Gyllenhal as stars in this picture?"" What started out as a great white hope ended up as a snow white mess! The dialogue had me wishing I hadn't bought the supersize popcorn and soda. The movie had no convincing drama and the characterization was tired and worn. I was hoping for the next big special fx sequence to freeze everyone to death just to end the movie. This lame horse of digital wizadry was not thoughtful or provocative. In fact, it left me as cold and blank as.....New York in an ice age."
4,"...And Now, A Comment from The Vast Right Wing Conspiracy..","If this is what we're really in for if we maintain our evil ways of fossill fuel burnin', THEN COOL!!! More places for me to ride my snowboard. Now, can you invest your time, money and CGI in a good guys versus Islamic terrorists movie?"
2,We couldn't destroy the environment if we tried!,"I'll just say a couple of things about this movie...I enjoyed the special effects. The story was silly and the acting wasn't all that interesting. And as to the idea that humans are going to cause this disaster, it's nonsense. God made this entire universe, and to think that we even COULD destroy the environment if we were actively trying to is the height of humanistic arrogance. We couldn't destroy the environment if we tried. Sure, the environment may change. But it won't be because of us.Don't believe me? Then lets put our heads together and try to destroy the ozone layer...can't be done. The sun creates ozone when its rays hit the earth's atmosphere. More sun = more ozone. Less sun = less ozone. So to destroy our ozone layer, we'd have to shut off the sun. Anyone up for that?Same with global warming. We couldn't cause it if we devoted our entire national budget to it."
3,"Entertaining, but Slanted","This was an entertaining movie, but it would have been better without the political slant."
2,even the CGIs couldnt save this disaster,"but it did have moments of ok'ness(the multiple tornados in L.A.the flooding of NYC)other than those moments,its a big hackathon.theres really no word sufficient to describe just how bad the acting was.i was actaually rooting for Mother Nature.for those looking for good CGI themed disaster flicks,Dantes Peak and Twister(the acting here is almost as bad as day after thanks to the pitiful jaime gurtz)might fit the bill.for those who dont ask much of there cinematic experiences,or if you find anything on MTV cutting edge then youll love this.btw,jake,you let me down here bud!"
3,This movie was...,This movie was horrible. I saw it at a cheap theater (thank god)so it was not that bad but sericely. I would almoust be inclinde to give them a good review because it was very amusing to whach. The digitule efects were amazingly good but the plot was not the best and it was soooooooooooo cheasy!! One scen my friend looks over at me and says a line then the guy says it I mean come on.If there is nothing els out and I hadn't seen it I probebly would see it but only with a laid back funnie group of people.
1,UNREALISTIC!!!!,"This movie was very unresalistic. Here's why1. What was the Dennis Quaid character going to do when he got to the library?2. The Dennis Quaid character walked 40 miles in -400 degree weather.3. The Oil Tanker can navigate through a city under water?4. There is NO WAY a storm that big can form in three days. Everything we saw in the movie would happen over millions of years, no days.5. When the ice storm chased the Dennis Quaid character into the building, he started a small fire. Wouln't the fire suck up all the air?6. The fire wasn't big enough to survive the ice storm in the first place.7. The President of the United Sates just leaves half the country to freeze (I know this was adressed in the movie but he made up his mind fast)."
2,Boring,"Truly boring. Some different special effects, but the same old story as any other disaster flick. Really stupid."
2,Bad Movie,"It definately was a movie made to make a point about something that people can only speculate over. The downside to that is that when people try to make a point about something most people do not believe in nor care about, it is the formula for a bad movie and this movie is no exception.This movie did so little to draw you in and keep your attention. Yes it is based off of science fiction, but I did not feel the realness in anything they did. When the Alien Ship was advancing on NYC in the movie ID4, you felt it.Anyway, this movie is horrible. I do think it was a great concept as many of us like to see things destroyed. But the acting, script, and just the fact that they attempt to preach their tree-hugging views on me makes this a movie not to see."
5,awesome!,"this movie is awesome!!!!!!!!! i went and saw this the opening day, it i must say, it is one of the best movies ive ever seen.it might still be in some theaters, and you should go see it. it comes out on DVD and VHS on october 5th i think. it might be later though, but the friggin point is, is that it comes out on video in october and I CANT WAIT! ..... umm..... ok bye."
1,Just Couldn't Get Al Gore's Face Out of My Mind!!,"Ok people, seriously now, this movie isn't even based on the slightest of scientifically established fact! Everyone knows that this global warming idea was born out of the desire of less developed countries to stagnate our United States from becoming even more powerful and productive. Is it no wonder why Al Gore is like the biggest promoter of the film? He's like the first on the list of the ""Blame America"" crowd. It's probably a good thing he wasn't elected. Maybe that's why he hates us so much....we were'nt dumb enough to hand him the presidency! I can't wait for him to go off on another anti-Bush rant. His face contorts in so many ways! Only an old-time preachers face can do so many backflips!But hey, he's got the growl down! No doubt this film will have awesome special effects, and for that I might see it; MIGHT see it. But if I do, I'll see it with the thought in mind that this is just some more good old American fiction."
5,bad ass!!!,"Today i went 2 see the movie at willobrock amc24 houston texas at 2:05pm and this movie is great. i really mean it! in this movie theres all u want i meen everything. action, lil comedy, drama, things blowing up, and so on.all of you that made a review b4 seening it u wer right. this is a kick ass movie and i cant wait till it comes out on dvd."
5,ONE OF THE BEST DISASTER MOVIES YET!,"If you're into disaster movies (""Armegeddon"", ""The Core"", Deep Impact"", etc.) then you will love The Day After Tomorrow! (It's a hell of a lot better than all of those!) It's knid of a mix between ""The Core"" and ""Twister"". It starts to slow down just a little bit in the middle, but picks right back up. Gotta get this movie when it comes out on DVD or see it now while it's still in theaters! Excellent special effects, excellent script, excellent plot! Makes the disaster movies that I named earlier look crappy! To sum it all up, I think pretty much anyone should reaaly get into this!"
1,Environmental Gloom & Doomsayers Revenge Fantasy,"I spent a year watching this movie once. Couldn't even get excited about the special effects which were mainly been-there and done-that (think Deep Impact with Morgan Freeman).The world (at least the industrialized, Western-Civilized portions of it) is coming to an end, and it's all our fault. We're bad, bad, BAD overconsumers, and now we must pay the price. Best of all, at the end of the movie the U.S. Vice President (formerly depicted as a meany) is humbled & grovels for forgiveness to 3rd world countries who ""graciously"" took in ice age refugees, in exchange for the U.S. forgiving billions of dollars in 3rd world debt.Made me want to run out, buy a Hummer, start smoking, and shellac my hair with Aquanet."
1,I HATE HUMANS !!!,"This is the polar bear speaking against humans.You humans are such sinners.You are selfish, all you care about is yourself.You are destroying the rainforest b/c you waste paper.(No forest,no medicine)And when the polar ice caps melt...Way Less Land!Especially the Americans...the most polluting country on Earth.Even China has more people than America but yet they don't create as much pollution as you lazy selfish careless Americans do. One day the Animal Kingdom and Mother Nature will get its revenge on yous. Selfish earth-destroyers!"
1,Some say the world will end in stupidity.....,"Very very funny, unbelievably stupid. Eight year olds in the theater were gleefully pointing out some of the more entertainingly insipid ""science"". I've read that Gore tried to promote the movie in order to encourage public discussion about the very serious problems that he claims we face from the threat of global warming. (17-year-old Hollywood newcomer Emmy Rossum may attract more attention from Gore's ex-boss.) Honestly, if anyone ever brings up ""The Day After Tomorrow"" in order to launch into a serious conversation about the environment, you'll know you're in the company of a moron.OK, say it again: Thank God for Florida."
1,pointless drivel of a story,"Seriously... what the heck was the big tension in this dumb movie? A father wanting to reconnect with this kid after the world changes for the worse? ... and his colleagues are willing to risk their lives - and yes, die- so he can get to his son. So then what happens when dad shows up? Does daddy make it better? no... just a pointless and stupid plot. Did someone actually get paid to write this script? Review: Garbage; not worth your time."
2,Painful,"This movie was pretty awful. While the actors did well, the screenplay tanked the movie. It wasn't quite Star Wars Episode I,II,III bad, but it came close."
1,dont make bad movies please,i guess without bad movies we wouldnt have good ones.i keep thinking that their trying to be beat the two worst ever made.waterworld and Armageddon.
2,Amazon is NOT Blu-Ray quality,"I am not reviewing the movie, just the quality of the disc. I was hoping to watch some of my favorite action movies in Blu-Ray on my new computer, and add to my small collection. I watched two vids for a short time, sensing something was not right. I then watched ""Pirates..."", and ""Dark Knight"", purchased at full price from Best Buy some time ago. Big difference!!! Amazon is selling regular or dupped ""Blu-Rays"". A fraud. They are no where near the picture quality from Blu-rays purchased elsewhere. Those that I have purchased that have not arrived yet, will be returned. I am totally disappointed in Amazon now, and they have lost my respect as an honest retailer."
2,I'm surprised people liked this movie,"You can almost see the guys sitting around a table planning the movie. They want disasters. Lots and lots of disasters. Lets do a tornado. No, that's been done. How about a bunch of them all at once? Great idea! And there, let's have high winds. What about earthquakes? Do we have time for that, while we're putting all of New York under ice? Hey, Frank, how long did the other ice ages take to start? I dunno Bill, but didn't I read somewhere that geological time is like a thousand times faster than normal time? Yeah. Something like that. Let's see now, do you think we should put in some science to try and explain it? Uh, okay, we'll say it's, uh, that's it's due to global warming! Yeah! And it's believable, that's what I like about it!!Come to think of it, maybe I'm being too generous with the 2 stars."
1,Put 2 and 2 together.,"Brought to you by the same people who dropped Godzilla and Independence Day on the American public. 2 of the worst films ever made. When will people learn that special effects should be secondary to the plot. If you can't compose a decent script, then chances are your film will suck...like this one."
1,NEVER GONNA HAPPEN!!!,"Look, this is never going to happen, the temp over the past 100 years has gone up only 1.8 degrees F. And whos to know who kept records from the early 1900's, very flawed, i do NOT believe in global warming , so this movie was terrible."
4,Edge of my seat,"I bought this movie and couldn't finish seeing it because it was scratched but the first hour had me on the edge of my seat. I kept squirming and wanting more. What fascinated me about this film is how the director brings the end of this ice age and the beginning of a relationship between father and son. They say that tragedy sometimes breaks up families but what happens when a family is already broken up, they are reunited. Hurray! I loved it!!!!!!!"
3,Wait till the day after tomorrow and watch it...,"Not nearly as bad as most reviewers said, but still pretty bad. Looks great and some amazing effects, but very slim in the sustance department. The story is non-existent. Watch it with a friend and have fun with the horrible dialogue and the stunning looks - of the effects and the cast."
4,incredibly exciting and a great entertainment,"i got my dvd today, and boy was i pleasantly delighted! a great disaster flick that is wildly entertaining and thought provoking, especially with the current boonies in the white house, who could care less about global warming! the disc is superb looking, as is the dts sound! get it you will be entertained-not disappointed! it's a winner........."
3,"Suprisingly ""OK""","Through breathtaking scenery and a somewhat developed plot, this movie was better than I expected."
2,Even sci-fi has to have a basis in fact...,"I watched this with my wife and parents. By the way, I grew up in Alaska so I know COLD. My Dad and I just started laughing at the helicopter freezing up in mid-flight because the fuel started to solidify. My Dad was also an aircraft mechanic and although oil can get sludgy at low temps freezing aviation fuel is almost impossible outside a laboratory. But of course this is explained by some weird new weather phenomena that comes about in a matter of days, apparently.The best part was the United States having to ask permission of Mexico to cross their border. I could almost hear Rik from the Young Ones saying ""take that, fascist bully-boy!"" Please. This thing is a politically correct fable from beginning to end. How else could you explain freezing hurricanes being the result of... global warming?"
3,its Cold in here!,"Okay movie but kind of repetitive. Plenty of action but lacks in the story. The actors other than Quaid and gyllenhaal were weak. This movie iS the absulute WORST MOVIE IN THE WORLD! I HATE DENNIS, HE REMINDS ME OF MY UNCLE! just joking. The movie's action scenes were good but it seems like there are the same actions seens three times in the movie! But other than that It's pretty good!"
2,"More like a cloudy day, with a chance of rain......","Hype! The movie did not live up to the hype. Well one thing that is good from this movie is the visual, maybe for a game or something. Overall not that bad yet not that good disaster movie, maybe it is good the first time, but not to buy it though."
1,The only disaster is this film,"All scientific ""fact"" is thrown out of the way of this disaster, goofy dialog, cardbord characters, unbelievable happenings, but the special efects were the only high point of this film, what would Homer Hickam think?, probably a lot of laughs, if you put your brain in the ""deep freeze"" then this is your masterpiece! I recommend this epic ONLY if your having a bad movie party!"
1,A truly appaling B-movie about a global apocalypse. Why?,"Lacking the emotional intensity of a goldfish, The Day After Tomorrow pushes itself into the category of crowd pleasing blockbuster except that the crowd in my cinema were abhorred by the atrocious film.Yes, the effects were amazing, but the CGI wolves looked so utterly stupid I lost interest with the rest of the film. The acting was hammy and the dialogue both chichéd and dull. Any film containing the line 'You have to tell her how you feel' really doesn't deserve to exist.Save yourself a few bucks and don't see this convoluted mess of a film. It's $100,000,000 that could have been better spent."
2,Great special effects and that's about it,"What else can you say? The plot is simply bad science fiction. The ending as the vice president apologizes for whatever it is that he is apologizing for, is simply stupid. Despite the fact that ice ages have happened before with no input from humankind, this iceage was allegedly caused solely by human beings.This movie is not in any way politically incorrect. It is the epitome of political correctness. The message?? The VP, who is a clone of Cheney, is a stupid evil and ignorant man. He represents all of the stupid evil and ignorant humans who are causing global warming. What is politically incorrect about that? You can read that opinion in any newspaper on any day."
2,Not so subtle messages will have you roaring in laughter!,"I was looking forward to this film for a few months but I should have known better. After all, our friends in Hollywood only come up with two or three original plots or ideas every year, and most of those are on the indy front.Special affects wise, this was a really solid display of visuals. Plot-wise, this movie stunk up the theatre. The blatant political spin was hilarious. They are, as usual, so very subtle. You might find your stance on homelessness, atheism, global warming, immigration, gas usage and your views on the third world being challenged. The third world becomes the place to be, American usage of natural resources is ridiculed, and the great philosophers of the film happen to be a homeless man who steals hot dogs and an atheist with a warm spot for Western society. As for immigrants? You will no doubt change your view on immigration and welcome anyone into our country who wants our way of life (sarcasm)."
3,Cinematic Disaster? Not Quite!,"What's to upset about a sci-fier where mankind's muddling rains down disaster? For decades, movie-goers have watched nuclear-generated nasties mow down New York, Tokyo, and London. Equally monstrous asteroids have struck, the sun has gone nova, and space aliens have subjected the earth to every sort of catastrophic calamity. And yet rightwingers are handwringing over the suspiciously sudden spawning of global-warming wonders? (Why aren't environmentalists howling over that pseudoscientific killer-shrew portrayal of wolves?!) Like most foolhardiness-of-humanity movies, this one is a little preachy, soapy, and silly. There are characters with stock disaster-film traits, like love-denying ex's and love-finding young folks. There is corny comic relief and not-so-subtle socio/political satire. The special effects are state of the art and staggering. Summarily, the movie is much like the bulk of its ilk. Fans of such films should see it, and detractors should defer."
4,Better than expected!,The FX in this movie are excellent (except the CG wolves). The storyline was cliche' but stll pretty good overall (I seen much worse recently) and the science was very Hollywood but loosely accurate. The global warimng issue is very real as well as other topics (money is god). Overall I enjoyed this film and I will be getting it on DVD when it comes out.
4,"Sharp picture, excellent visual effects","The movie itself has a nice, solid message about global warming. I have no idea or what the odds with the disaster portrayed here, but the message is there. The story is told like other doomsday type movies, where the story is told through the eyes of key scientists and governing bodies. (It's not as intense as the latest 2012 and probably shouldn't be.) And of course, human drama related to disasters and heroism. The visual effect is as good as anything offered these days, and the picture is sharp and clean consistent with best of blu-ray in 1080p.WARNING: For viewers that pay attention to exceptional details, you might find various things just not believable (as one reviewer so fondly pointed them out). So if you are one of those, you may be stuck with having problems and not enjoy the movie.Overall, it's a good movie to get as a home theater show case title, especially if the price hovers around $10."
2,"Beautiful Score, but over-the-top story","Okay, we've all heard about global warming by now, but this movie seriously blows it way out of proportion. Realistically, ice ages take place over the course of several thousand years of gradual climate shifts, not in what? 9 days? Please... This film will likely be seen as a great heralding warning to humanity by the enviromental kooks, a warning of a threat that is not at all even existant. But if you check REAL science at the door and put on your pseudo-scientific eyeglasses, the movie is good fun, and what a resemblance that vice president has to VP Cheney--gee golly whiz-I wonder what THAT was implying? These evil Bambi-killing conservatives--we're all out to get you! Anyhow, the real save for this movie is the majestic score. Herald Kloser never fails to blow me away with his compositions. My advice is to buy the soundtrack, rent the movie."
2,Not good.,"This film is nearly entertaining. Dennis Quaid is almost likable. You almost don't root for the deaths of all the characters. The film is a good work of propaganda, the special effects are dizzying, and they were one of the few things that kept me in the theatre. I still drove my gas guzzler home after the film, and I'm not worried about giant landbased hurricanes freeze-drying me.I would say see this movie in the theatre, since its only attributes are the special effects, and a home entertainment system sytem cannot deliver that part of the movie properly. Or better yet, skip this flick entirelyIf you are interested in the real global warming debate, do so in the academic field, not in the movie theatre. Hollywood needs to stop producing films that are based just on special effects, while avoiding plot, character development, or other elements of cinematography."
2,Wolves?,"This movie has a plot, but it is greatly rushed. Plus (note that I study wolves) the wolves in it are digital and incorrectly portraid. For in the movie they are villians while in reality, they would much rather run away from a human if possible. Anyway, the movie has good effects, but acting is not at its prime. Two stars really sums up the movie."
4,Who knew I'd give Ronald Emmerich this many stars?,"This is not the best acted, and it's certainly not the best scripted film I've ever seen. But for the first time, one of Mr. Emmerich's offerings was so involving visually, that I was able to overlook the giant size plot holes, and the characters that seemingly came out of a box somewhere. This isn't any less ludicrous that Independence Day, or certainly Godzilla, but for once, the images were powerful enough to let me power my brain down for the afternoon and just sit back and watch the pretty colors.Do not go into this movie expecting high art. But, in Gene Siskel's old maxim, it is more interesting than a documentary of the actors having lunch, and it's from that perspective that my inner film geek finds peace with his enthusiam."
4,"Good Fun, But Some Bits Just Have to Be Made Fun Of!!!","Ok, so this is a fun, good movie to see and even to own, with great special effects, and good acting, but i mean oh my goodness, thier are some very, funny things here. (I mean they aren't meant to be funny!) But it's very enjoyable! See it, Rent it, just maybey don't buy it."
4,"A lot of fun, great special effects","This was a fun popcorn movie. Great special effects, heroes and heroines getting into all kinds of danger from moment to moment, etc. The science was a little silly, but, on the other hand, it's only a movie. The biggest downside was the clumsy computer-generated timberwolves (they couldn't have used real trained animals?). A lot of fun and definitely worth seeing if you like action/adventure movies."
4,Roland Emmerich at His Best,"I have mixed opinions about Roland Emmerich's films. But ""The Day After Tomorrow"" makes me smile. The special effects were amazing, the plot was riveting, and the movie had a more serious tone than other Emmerich films I've seen. Very well-scripted. After watching ""2012"" (Emmerich's latest disaster film) and being a disaster fanatic, I was not quite as captivated by the apocalyptic qualities ""The Day After Tomorrow"" provided. But for once Roland Emmerich pulled off a film focused more on the story than the effects. The world needs more movies like this."
3,Decent enough disaster film,"I like disaster films, but they are all, for the most part predictable. This is no exception but at least its a fun ride. Its kind of long too, but I didnt mind it so much. The action is the best part in this film. I loved the helicopter scene where they all just froze. Pretty amazing effects. I'm sure this film has a message that we should all be listening to, but it was awfully ridiculously quick how everything happened, and while I'm no scientist, I cant see all that happening in a span of pretty much 1 day. Other than that, its a pretty solid made film."
2,Check your brain at the door,"Great special effects save this from the dreaded 1 star rating but special effects alone do not constitute a movie.Everything is half-baked in The Day After Tomorrow. Tired and predictable plot and script, stereotyped characters, laughable science and politics... The movie is so sure we will be unable to understand it's so obvious message that it is neatly summarized for us at the end.I would avoid this turkey."
2,The movie george bush doesn't want you to see,actually I don't want you to see it either. This movie was really bad and long. I might have given it 3 stars if the torture wasn't so prolonged. the only redeeming quality of this film are a few 3 minute bursts of cool (heh get it?) moments. I think there might be 12 minutes I enjoyed about it... and I'm being generous.TDAT... don't do it
2,Only If You're Desperate to Kill 2 Hours,"I like Dennis Quaid. I like sentimental movies. And I even like Dennis Quaid in sentimental movies, witness my love affair with The Rookie (2002). So when I say I could have lived without seeing The Day After Tomorrow, it's not just Quaid-bashing or too-hip-to-watch-a-tear-jerker posing.Yes, the special effects were something in this film's corner, but the preachiness about global warming, the far-fetched plot, and the over-the-top acting by virtually every character left me cold (sorry about that one).Seriously, though, had I paid full price to see this one in the theatre I'd have been peeved."
3,the day after christmas,"As far as disaster movies go, I thought this one was pretty unrealistic until the ""day after christmas"" 2004. I never thought I would actually hear people use the term ""wall of water"" in real life. Then I turned on CNN."
3,"A reminder of human fragility, but I wouldn`t buy it","Just get some popcorn, a comfortable couch and watch it once or twice, then go back to the rental store! Interesting concept, a reality that can catch us sooner than later, but similar to other movies. Average"
3,Good movie if your looking to be entertained.,"When I saw trailers for the movie, my first reaction was to pass on it. It looked like every other disaster movie that was made. When ""The Day After Tomorrow"" came to our ""cheap"" theatre, my partner and I decided to take advantage of $1.50 night and go see this movie. After all, it would be cheaper than renting the movie. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed ""Day After"". The plot is predictable, and one of my initial thoughts while watching the moive was ""Hey, they should call this Deep Impact 2: Deep Freeze"", but after a short while, I warmed up to the movie, and I did enjoy myself. Its good entertainment, well worth at least one viewing, but as far as owning the movie, I'll probably pass on that. If you're looking for something stellar and groundbreaking and Oscar worthy, don't bother. If you are looking to be entertained for two hours, then watch it. But this is an instance where I would caution a ""rent before buying""."
2,Bad Science Meets Worse Script,"The Day After Tomorrow (TDAT) reminds me of an empty-headed, cheeky blonde: nice to look at, but vapid. TDAT combines bad science with a ridiculous script. The scene with escaped wolves threatening the protagonists on a ship that has washed up on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan is typical, over-the-top, silly dreck. Nauseating groaners permeate this radical environmentalist dream such as after half of the US is destroyed with -150 degree cold descending from the upper atmosphere, an astronaut says in all seriousness, ""The air seems clearer.""TDAT only redeeming quality is its eye-popping special effects. The tornados decimating LA are spectacular. The NYC flood satisfies all who question Manhattan's cultural superiority. Unfortunately, all this eye candy isn't enough to rescue this stinker."
5,The Day After Tomorrow (Full Screen Edition),Awesome movie!!!! never got a chance to watch it all on t.v. so i bought it. a must see movie.
1,Trash,I don't really need to say much. This movie is some more multi-million dollar budget trash. This movie is horrible. You don't have to see this to know whats going to happen in the end. What happens in the end of all movies that are garbage? We all know. I wish I could murder this movie.
2,Chilly at best,"While I enjoyed the special FX on this one the story was a bit too far fetched for me... I usually hate when people say that because after all it is a work of fiction but this was out there. I feel like what the characters did and said were contradictory EX. the man tells everyone how they couldn't go outside because they will instantly freeze, yet he and friends proceed to walk from DC to NYC... ya...Basic story... world is ending... mans son is in NYC on class trip... man wants to save him... man travels in the killer weather to save son... lots of people die... man reaches son... man and son live... blah blah blah the end... all admist some cool special FXThe movie wasn't that lost on me. I enjoyed the special FX as I stated above. Some parts looked as if we were watching a news peice and the disasters were happening... but the FX alone weren't enough alone to save the movie for me.I suppose its message was to take care of the earth."
2,"Not worth the purchase, perhaps rental","There really isn't much to say about this movie. It tries to make astatement about the environment and how we need to change our ways.That's true, but it's still not a great movie. Good special effects but by the time all is said and done, it's rather dull. I guess the director or writer felt there's only much you can do withstorms they decided to throw some hungry attack wolves for excitement.The two stars is for special effects.Side Point: Doesn't the actor who plays Denis Quaid's son look like Woody from Toy Story?"
1,"This movie is really, really bad","This movie is really bad, I mean ""Showgirls"" bad. Don't believe me? The premise is a fast-forward ice age that basically occurs overnight. So, it's certainly high on the believability factor. And the culprit? Of course, it's global warming and all the selfish human beings who brought it about. And, oh yeah, Mexico becomes a safe-haven for Americans and we have to beg THEM to come into THEIR country. And if you think that's bad, just wait until you see the acting.The only part worth watching was when a reporter gets dusted by a flying billboard flung through the air by an LA twister. It was great - almost as good as the T-Rex eating the lawyer in Jurassic Park. My advice, watch that part then turn it off."
4,The Day After Tomorrow....aka the day the blu-ray disc was released...,"First off, let me say that this movie is great.Given its flaws, like the people in the library burning the books while the wooden chairs were there and wood burns longer, i think...but with all its flaws, the movie is still in my top 3 disaster films for all time.The sad fact that there is more than 18 minutes of ""deleted scenes"" on the disc is what upset me the most. If they had given some time (and budget) to finish the CG parts it would have been an awesome ""alternate version"". I say alternate because of the scenes where Dennis Quaid was in the kitchen with his friend was totally different from the theatrical version.Bottom line, buy the blu-ray disc....but the producers should have made an effort to shell out some dough to make the ""alternate version"" included to give it more distinction from the dvd version or any other version they come out with."
3,"Fun to watch, but could have been much better","The special effects are great and the acting is tolerable for the type of movie (mindless entertainment). If they had stayed away from the politics angle and just said the disasters were caused by a meteor hitting the north pole or something similar, it would not have come off so hokey.Trying to tie in the current administration (the Vice President sure does look like Cheney) with all the stuff about the Kyoto treaty just made the movie look stupid. Note to the writers..when writing a fantasy film, don't include the DNC talking points and make it seem like the Republicans are trying to cause the world to end. It makes you look petty and ruins your movie."
3,Great Example,"I went to see this film because I had heard a lot of good thing from my friends. So far the film is great in special effect, however the story was so...o empty. I mean, there were a lot of expression in this film that have intention to warn mankind not to continuing abuse the nature, there will be a greatest debt that we all have to pay in the future then...there a hollywood style, a hero who on his own, drag his friend to NY to save his son and others. That's what I called empty.Anyway, the film did fill me in some thought of the possible future of mankind and make no mistake that it will come sooner than later if we done nothing."
2,Proceed with Caution,"The 2 stars are for the f/x which were, for the most part, great. However the rest of the film is just one big, sloppy mess. Dumb story, horible dialogue, overwraught direction. This flick has some good folks in it too - it's a shame they are terribly wasted. Maybe if you watch it drunk."
2,Kyoto?,"The special effects were great and the movie was ejoyable to watch. The story left a lot to be desired. I couldn't even count the number of times I was thinking ""you couldn't do that!"" This was obviously a politically motivated film with the emphasis on signing the Kyoto Treaty."
3,The end of the world for special effects,"Filled with visually captivating and beautiful (though it's destruction) scenery noticeably bereft of a solid story or even decent dialogue. There's a real contrast between halfway cogent scientific theories and meager everyday conversation in this film. Frequently the characters appear way too calm (as the world is apparently coming to end) and the plot-line of Quaid's character reaching his son in New York is almost laughable.Like Twister, an otherwise perfectly entertaining action/special effects movie is dragged down by a haphazard script and weak acting.It's a fun movie to watch and laugh at!"
3,It's got storms...,"If you like BIG effects, BIG, WORLDWIDE, CATACLISMIC storms, and Dennis Quaid--you're easily suckered. I'll admit that the effects are incredible and realistic and BIG, but the movie is nothing to get excited about...but hey, if you've got nothin to do, pull up a chair, get out the string cheese and enjoy a long environmental scolding."
2,In one word...Lame,"The Day After Tomorrow isn't a bad film; it is an incredibly weak film. There are some nice special effects but those are too few and far between to carry the movie. The only saving grace of the movie is Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhall. Both are good actors but have given better performances. The movie could have easily been written by pulling formula pieces out of a hat and I wouldn't be surprised if that is how it was written. If you think a movie like The Core is great, then you will love The Day After Tomorrow. If you must see it, save your money and rent it. Then you won't suffer the embarrassment of friends seeing it in your collection and asking ""You bought that?!?!"""
5,The Day After Tomorrow,"I have to admit I am a huge fan of disaster movies. My favorite was the Posideon Adventure; however, the movie has been surpassed by TDAT. The special effects are incredible. When NYC freezes, you can feel the cold. The story is a little weak, but doesn't subtract from a fantastic disaster movie."
2,What's the temperature like outside?,"The Day After Tomorrow is silly good fun. Great visual effects despite the silly plot line based on a book by Art Bell and some other guy. That said Dennis Quaid mushing his way from DC to NYC is exciting, though how did he drive in a blinding blizzard from DC to Philly in 30 minutes? And that is the problem with this movie. Not only bad science, and I certainly adhere to the Global Warming theories, but oversights of the obvious. A giant tidal wave hits the East Coast and all the phone systems work. Yeah, that's believable. The cell system even works after the electric grid fails. Also, while they are burning books in the NY Public Library to keep warm can anyone explain why they were not burning wooden furniture first? This movie gets so silly at times that whatever message it is trying to convey gets lost in all that silliness surrounded by special effects. This one barely rates 2 1/2 stars. Watch in the middle of winter I say."
2,GOOD EFFECTS BUT DISSAPOINTING.,"I have beendying to see this film since it came out in the cinema, i never actually sawit in the pictures just in case i couldn't stand it therefore would have to sit through it all. Anyway, i enjoy watching disaster films as they are made brilliantly and it makes you see what happens in real life, and of course there's a lot going on in them like dante's peak. I expected the same in this, it is nothing like i thought it was going to be though now i have had it. I suppose i will get a little bit used to it. Some of the actions in the film are great but others by looking at them you can tell they are computer imaged. Basically it's about tornadoes, a massive tsunmi sort of thing and there's a lot goin on but i didn't particuarlly like the acting in it or anything. Buy i would highly recommend it for the aduts."
2,great special effects... not much else,"This movie has some terrific special effects, but it lacks real characters and an accurate plot. If you like Independence Day, you will like this one. I give it 2.5 stars primarily for the effects."
2,Overused Computer Effects,"Just overused computer effects that are great exagerated. I seen when it first came out. Wish I had waited till it came to the $1 theatre showing. Even some of the acting had me bored. In the event of another ice age, I doubt if it will happen like the computer made it happen here. I think it will take a little more time."
2,Sucky,"when i rented this on DVD i was expecting long action sequences with people fighting, punching and mayhem everywhere. No such thing. 90% of the movie was these scientists just studying the weather. the 5 minutes of violence in the whole movie wasn't even that cool. And those long boring library sequences, what's up w/ that? and the nerve of them trying to stick a teenage love story in with everything. I cant believe this grossed $185 million at the box office. Simply put, this movie kinda sucks."
2,Special Effects! Five stars! Storyline Two stars.,"Sorry to say it but the special effects are the only reason to see this picture. When I saw it in the theater, I went knowing why I was there: TO SEE THE SPECIAL EFFECTS!I didn't expect some great story. I didn't expect a great drama with great dialogue. I wanted to see a disaster flick and that's exactly what I got.So I give The Day After Tomorrow five stars for effects! Pick it up and know what you're getting."
3,A decent movie that takes pause to think,"All of our main characters survive that in reality most if not would have died had these events really happened. They built a pretty good story around a worst case scenario and the acting wasn't bad, not great but 3 stars. I've watched this movie a couple of times and I think that's all the life I will get out of it, worth watching, but not worthy of library space."
3,suspension of disbelief,"""Nowadays"" between New York and Los Angeles. A climatologist (Dennis Quaid) needs to find a way to save ""the world"" from global warming. His son (Jake Gyllenhaal) is hiding with a group of friends in the New York Public Library and is experiencing first-hand the major weather changes.Special effects were all wonderful. I was only disappointed in the wolves: they did not look real at all.Keep in mind when watching this movie that it requires a *lot* of suspension of disbelief. Most of what happens is beyond belief and rather predictable.That said, it is still enjoyable entertainment, and Dennis Quaid proves that he is an excellent actor. Gyllenhaal is not the best, but the casting was decent enough for this movie.Pure Hollywood entertainment. What else can one expect from a director like Roland Emmerich."
3,The Day after Tomorrow could have waited a few months more,"There was nothing new in the doomsday epic ""The Day After Tomorrow"". Be sure, the cinema photography and the special effects were good, and the story line was decent, but the movie lacked in several respects. Mostly from the director, who could not have possibly watched the final cut. If he did, he was full of himself and missed out on what he actually created.The acting in the movie was mediocre at best, not that the actors themselves were bad, but again this falls on the director. I can imagine my mother, cousins, aunts and uncles... all those ladies that watch soap operas, real people and how they would react in these situations... it just didn't fit.You may want to add this to your collection, it is far from a A movie, but a step above the B movies of the 1970's, If you need to, rent it, watch it explore it love it for what it is. Doomsday movie collectors, this really is a must for you. For the rest of us we hope for something better."
2,"Good Premise, Unbelievable outcome.","I'm sorry. I just couldn't get into this movie. But, just to please the masses, I watched it the whole way through. I admit that the sepcial effects were great but I have got to tell you something: CGI and WOLVES do not go together. Not in my book. If you wanna present danger than get real wolves. Don't toy with my emotions. Also, it's kind of hard to believe that the scientist would plead to death about dealing with the situation and no one listens. Believe me, after all the things that the earth goes through you'd think that someone would listen. Anyway, That's what I have to grip about."
2,"Eye candy, but little else","The visual effects in the movie are entertaining, but has little else to offer.The idea behind the movie is a bit perposterous, but it is an action movie. There are a few liberal political messages the movie sends, but at least it doesn't beat you over the head with them...much.The climax of the movie is a bit anti-climactic. When millions of people die, it seems a bit difficult getting involved in the struggles of a few individuals.If you're in the mood for some high action, give this a try...providing you've exhausted some of the other higher rated action films."
3,So wrong on so many levels,"My wife and I watched this movie two nights ago. While ""so wrong on so many levels"" was how she described it, we thoroughly enjoyed it. This is a movie that was made to be seen at home so that you can laugh and snicker at all of the appropriate times. That said, it's a hoot! If you want a serious or just semi-believable movie about the consequences of global warming, this isn't the one. If you merely want two hours of fairly absurd unintentional comedy, this works."
3,Day After Tomorrow,"Interesting movie but too many factual inaccuracies. Anyone living in Canada knows that you can't go outside without your face covered when it is -20 degrees, let alone -120!"
1,So bad I couln't stop laughing,"I have to say the CGI are great but the storyline is baaaaaaad. This movie includes all the stereotypes and clichés of a disaster movie and that makes it so previsible: The teens who, of course, will fall for one another at the end of the movie. The separated couple who, of course, will make things up. The father and son who barely know each other who, of course by the end, will have the strongest bond ever. The guy who will sacrifice his live for his friend... Hopefully, I'm not going to list them all here. Bad. Bad. Bad. The idea of using the global warming as a start was a good one in my opinion but the storyline and the actors are really bad."
5,A for Awesome,"I thought The Day After Tomorrow was a great movie because of the never-ending tense moments it unfolds, the undoubtedly spectacular special effects, and the deliciously clever occurrences the movie shoves in every now in then (such as the Hollywood sign being eaten up by a tornado, as you may have seen happen on the trailer). The plot is actually fairly lame; but the incredible disasters that are portrayed on screen are so insanely awesome that the plot no longer became a problem for my judgment. Scarcely a minute in this film is left without a scene of action or a key event, and many times I found myself on the edge of my seat when viewing this movie for the first time in the theater. Additional positive things concerning this film were that not many movies have been made like this one, and that the deaths of certain characters are well planned so that they affect the viewer strongly. I would declare The Day After Tomorrow a must-see movie for all these reasons and more."
1,Stupid!,"This was the most horrific acting I've seen in a long time! And I don't think it had to do with the actors personally, but the dialogue from the script and the story/plot line. It was hard to like or feel connected with any of the characters- and half the time you're thinking- what are they doing? I just wanted the movie to end and it felt like it never was going to. Some advice-Don't waste your time or money on this one-unless you're really desperate for a movie to rent."
1,A day never to come,Even if the SFX were exceptional the scientific basis was lacking. At some points it was even unbelievable. It seems that the law of thermodynamics need not apply nor plain common sense.The taxi scene was the most awful as well as the total freezing sequences. Can it be colder than outer space?This movie was a total deception. Now who will take global warming seriously?We didn't need to have this global apocalypse to show the consequences of global warming. Just have a look at the weather channel. It has already begun and it is only the very beginning. So beware it's going to get worse.If you to be entertained go see the movie but don't expect too much of it. It is a pure fantasy.
3,The curiousity of The Day after Tomorrow,"The Day after Tomorrow was made, apparently, for one reason: To wow the audience with its special effects and for a few moments make us feel like we are also dodging tidal waves and tornadoes. In that way, for me, it succeeded.You can't approach effects vehicles the same way as hardcore drama's that are filled with the do's and do not's of life. You have to step back and ask: Do I care enough about these characters to worry whether they make it or not? I felt so. I am a massive Gyllenhaal fan, and can't wait for the day when Dennis Quaid gets to show off his true capabilities as an actor. (Check out ""Frequency"" or ""Dragonheart"").The Day after Tomorrow will no doubt become a show-off disc for my home theatre sound system, and for those who can be willing to have simple minded fun for a few hours this will be the showcase. Though I know some of the savor will be lost as far as scope, it will still be a good dvd to own. ~saos~"
3,Where will you be? Probably not buying the DVD.,"I think that I went into this movie with expectations that were too high. I found the movie to be clumsy and underdeveloped. Many would argue that this movie is meant to be seen for the special effects and that's probably true, however, I didn't find the special effects overwhelming enough to distract me from the simplistic storyline. It all seemed to happen too fast and everything was so brief that it was just too unsatisfying. A brief scene with escaped wolves, a stereotypical teenager love relationship, and a very sick boy in a hospital. All in the movie with no real purpose. As for the visual effects, there many things that were really cool and worth seeing. The tornados in Los Angeles, the flooding of Manahttan, and I particularly liked the scene where the helicopters froze in mid air. Overall, I have to say that this is not a bad movie. Just don't go in with high expectations and you'll be fine."
4,Shows the Consequences of Global Warming,"I saw this movie right when it was released, and bought the DVD last week. I have to say that this is a superb movie filled with tons of special effects. It shows two things: 1. that our resources are on the verge of extinction and if we do not continue to watch ourselves, the similar scenario will happen. There will be a second world flood, (although not Biblical and we would not travel in the ark, like Noah did). Millions of people will die, and the whole world would be devastated.2. This film also shows the struggle of the main heroes. From that time when Sam decided to stay in the library (that was the only way to survive) to when he saved his girlfriend from dying of pneumonia to waiting patiently for his dad to arrive and rescue them all, this film makes us think about peoples' courage. In short, this film is a must for special effects buffs to our government."
3,Worth seeing once..,"This film has alot of good special effects but the dumb plot seems like an afterthought. The whole story centers around global warming triggering a new Ice Age. There are scenes where people are instantly frozen to death, tornados and hurricans flooding and tearing up cities.The movie fails to depict the true ramifications of such a climate upheaval: Society would end and a new ""Dark Age"" would ensue. Billions of people would die, not just from the weather but from starvation and the wars that would follow. The movie softballs the whole story, especially the subplot about the father who travels through the tundra on foot to rescue his son (simply ridiculous).Just like Independence Day, the movie works if you don't think too much."
4,"Good flick, awesome audio.",The movie is nothing special as far as movies go. It does an ok job of showing the epic wrath of the storm it depicts while keeping a personal touch with the main characters. The acts of heroism seem quite insignificant considering the scope of the desctruction and severity of the situation and could probably been edited out as they didn't really seem to fit the movie for some reason.Where this movie really shines is it's superb DTS 5.1 audio track. If you're watching the movie without it you will be severely distanced from it and probably bored to death. If you're watching in 5.1 you'll be looking outside to see if the world is still there when it's over.If you have a DTS capable system I would recommend you at least rent this film just to hear it as it probably has the best audio of any film ever. Films like the new Star Wars films have exceptional audio clarity but their stories lacked the opportunity to do what Day After Tommorow has done with surround sound perfectly.
1,Unfrozen Caveman Movie,"This is about as bad as it gets. Disaster movies, in this day and age, just aren't entertaining. Especially one as boring and unbelievable as this one.Millions dead and New York gets destroyed. Oh, except for Dennis Quaid and his ugly son. They somehow find each other against all odds. I want my two hours back!"
3,The Day After Tomorrow,"`The Day After Tomorrow' is one of those films that is hugely flawed, has dubious science and yet is extremely entertaining. Following what would happen in the face of rapid ice age this film follows one mans attempt to get his scientific research listened to by those in charge, as well as his sons fight for survival in storm stricken New York. The acting is pretty good, the direction is great, the special effects are very impressive and overall this makes for a top apocalyptic film with a modern theme. Whilst the themes of climate change are not to be ignored, the catastrophic nature of the scenario depicted wouldn't be as extreme or rapid and yet if you put this aside this makes for engrossing and entertaining viewing and is worth a watch.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
1,what we need to make this moive great is; WOLVES uneeded wolves!,"what a streange and technicly ponderius moive it was.we have rapid climent changes that no one can stop, whitch is orignal; every other moive of the same -genrah- has the hearo saveing the day- not here.every one moves to mexico in the end.in my oppinin this movie was runined by some ones need to make a movie that started with a orgnal plot, and turn it into every other disater moive; to any one who has seen this moive: why the wolves? thay added nothing to the story. why did the fuel in the helocptors freze instantly and the passengers not? how did Dennis Quaid's hands be cut and bleeding after tryng to pull his friend out of the snow covered mall and for the rest of the moive be, well, fine? and the incredable size changing russin oil tanker? but i diegress.verry good F\X, verry beliveable F\X watch the moive for the visuals, as for the plot... don't say i did'nt warn you."
3,The day after Kerry lost the election,"Another one of the typical HolyWood, Liberal, Tree-Hugging, Elitest movies, blaming the evil conservatives for everything from the extinction of the dinosaurs to the Tsunami that hit Asia. Note the resemblence of the high political figure to a real Republican one currently in office.If you can get past this fact and you're not one of the dumbing-down generation capable of being brainwashed by it...the special effects are good and if you just let yourself enjoy, it's a fair doomsday movie."
4,Timely and deserves consideration,"If one did not watch this movie before hearing what is happening now around the world, he/she may be thinking that all that is occurring is coincidental - NOT THE CASE!This movie will help to emphasize in your mind the advantage that we have been taking on what has been given to us. There is a great level of accurracy on ALL implications in this movie.Watch it and then listen to news - JUDGE FOR YOURSELF"
2,More Junk Science,"Are you going to include Al Gore's hysterical...and, inaccurae as well as designed to scare...""The Inconvenient Truth"" as a trailer?Take these antidotes to the media's, to include Hollywood, global warming hype: read ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science"" and visit the Junk Science web-site...and realize that the global temperature has gone up less than a degree in the past 75 years."
1,The Day After Tomorrow,"Poorly done film. Bad acting, bad script. But I do not agree that it is ""liberal bs."" I am actually offended that someone would say that. I am a liberal, that doesn't mean that I think we're on the brink of a new ice age. And by the way, you don't have to be liberal to know that the human race has done more harm to this world than good.This film is awful, regarless. The premise was interesting enough, but the events were poorly researched, the acting was melodramatic and the semi-happy ending was sickening."
1,Bad Business:,Order never arrived and sellar did NOT respond to my status inquiry. I did not notice the similar negative experiences of other customers until after I placed my order.:(
2,Wasted opportunity.,"Ok, it's not easy to satisfy critics. Emmerich has been (rightfully) backlashed for soulless stupidities like GODZILLA, THE PATRIOT, etc.... So, when he does a movie about a serious subject, where the action is a lot more slow paced, he fails again...Now, he fails not because of the patriotics, the stupidity, the cliches, whatever... he fails because he wrote a bad screenplay, and obtained half-hearted performances by his lead actors. Jake Gyllenhaal is the worst of them all, it will take some months (or years) to producers around the world give him another chance in something so ""big-budgeted""."
4,Great Special Effects,"Although the message of the film is unrealistic as it is based on the fictitious global warming hype which is a weird theory by a number of scientists and greenpeace fanatics to get government grants and so forth, the special effects in this flick are very well done. The plot is the age-old, but usually always interesting father saves son story. And the dad (Dennis Quaid) who is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, does a great job in making this film more interesting despite a soso script. But the humanistic message in this movie is good and encouraging. This flick makes for a nice popcorn crunching evening at the fireplace with warm blankets all around. And once you see this movie you probably won't look forward to the winter anymore. But as mentioned before, the special effects are great as these show us unrealistic scenarios in this well-done disaster flick and it's fun to stimulate our imagination once in a while."
4,An eye-candy,"This movie is pure summer entertainment, and nothing more. I didn't know what to expect when I first heard it's from the same director of Independence Day. But I find this movie to be 10 times better than Independence Day. It's dealing with our environvent, unlike the other one which deals with aliens. This movie has the best special effects I've ever seen, it looks so real and convincing. the story and cast are interesting enough, and it even has a political message.And for all those who complain about that same reason, that this movie has only special effects and without it it's nothing, well, why do you think cinemas and big screens were made for?I recommend watching this movie only on a big screen, with a good sound quality, especially on a hot summer day."
4,Great Movie- a few glitches,"Roland Emmerich is the master of creating awesome action movies (Godzilla, Independence Day), and this is one of them. When watching it, watch it for the incredibly awesome storms. Do not look too hard into the big plot and the incorrect science. If you do this, you will end up enjoying the movie very much. Hard to tell what the DVD will be like now, but i'm excited."
2,Special effects are good but that's it,"I give this movie 2 stars only for the special effects. I think the story was a good idea-but not fully developed and ready to be a movie. I think they should have worked on it a little more. First the idea of how the ice age starts is a little bizzar-second the amount of time it took for the ""ice age"" to happen is completely impossible. Then the ""storm"" just dissapated out of no where. Along with the bad story line, there was bad acting. So I recommend to wait until it goes to a dollar so that you can appreciate the special effects and sound in a theatre but don't waste your money."
3,Special Effects Delight,"If you're looking for an intellectual thriller, TDAT doesn't go there. This one's a pure popcorn munching visual extravaganza. Sub-par acting is the result of a weak script, but who cares? Once you've watched L.A. being wiped off the face of the earth with a plethard of tornadoes...and N.Y. taking the plunge via a tidal wave (no pun intended), you'll forget the forgettable acting of Dennis Quaid. If you liked ""Independence Day"" (I did), and ""Twister"" (I did), TDAT is right up your alley. I give it 3 stars only because of the Hollywood storyline (unbelievable and silly), and the horrendous acting. All three stars go to the special effects. Remarkable and breathtaking."
3,Climaxes too soon,"Global warming and the resultant melting of the polar icecaps results in a sudden catastrophic rearranging of the global climate, leaving mankind to scramble for cover. A climatologist (Dennis Quaid) treks to a frozen New York to find his lost son (Jake Guyllenhall). This is big, dumb summer fun that is more about special effects than anything else, and those special effects are impressive indeed. The twisters that decimate LA and the massive storm surge that inundates New York are the highlights of the film. But therein lies the problem, because those scenes occur about halfway through the movie. The story must rely more on the characters after that, but the characters just aren't interesting enough to sustain the film. The perils that they face become much smaller in scale as well. Who cares about wolf attacks, blood poisoning, and frostbite after we've seen the destruction of two major cities? I didn't."
2,Turn off your brain and go for it!!!,"That's the only way to enjoy this mess. Thw worst thing in this kind of disaster flick is that the producers try to give reasonable scientific background to explain all the absurds that happens in the film! That's annoying! Dennis Quaid's character would never get to New York.... And what abou that stupid ""RACE AGAINST THE COLD""? Never saw something like that, it was so stupid that I must give credit to the producers. I laughed a lot."
1,Beyond belief,"This is the biggest piece of balderdash I've seen in a while. Environmentalists and climatologists everywhere must be having severe cases of mental diarrhea due to embarrassment from this remarkably absurd rip-off of scientific theories. It makes Night of the Living Dead look like science fact. I suppose if I had seen it on a huge screen the visuals might have been impressive but on a TV screen - forget it. The only thing that saves this loony tune waste is the always exceptional performance of Jake Gyllenhaal. In fact, I suspect the only people who should buy this DVD are die-hard Gyllenhaal fans and folks who think it might someday become one of those ""its so bad its good"" cult films. Otherwise, don't waste your money or your time."
3,An Ok movie with good effects,"Check your brain and enjoy the effects.I love how the nerd in the library fixing the radio tells off the cop who asks him if he should find some help with it, ""I'm the president of the math club, the science club, and the chess club, so please, if you can find a bigger nerd than me, let me know."" ha!Anyway, the movie's not realistic and it makes fun of itself by creating these ironic situations-like everyone evacuating to Mexico.As far as the message goes, I'm glad it's there... cause you have to admit, we really don't take good care of our environment. Although it's probably not going to happen overnight, the ice-caps have melted a heck of a lot, and will continue to melt because of the things we do. Long term effects... who knows? It'll probably be gradual, but one day it'll come back to bite humanity- probably long after all the people who put us in the predicament have passed away."
3,Well....,This WOULD BE A GREAT MOVIE...........but it's been done before. That's all. It loses 2 stars because of it's scene stealing.
3,"Fun movie,if don't take the global warming serious...","This really is a fun movie to watch if you can dismiss all the global warming political statements and just enjoy it. Global warming has always been a fantasy by kook fringe groups that not one reputable scientist agrees with. Is'int man arogant enough without thinking we really can destroy the planet which has been around for millions and millions of years before man and will be here millions of years long after we are gone. The Earth is not this fragile thing these people would like us to believe so have fun watching this movie because it is a good movie but thats all it is, a movie."
3,Great special effects makes up for mediocre movie.,"There is nothing specific about this movie that is particularly bad. The story line okay. The acting is not necessarily Oscar material, but nonetheless is fair. The special effects of the flooding and freezing of New York City is pretty spectacular.My only quibble in terms of belivability is that in spite of cold temperatures there is no breath visible -- which given the amount of money that was spent on the special effects is an unacceptable oversight -- could have easily been done with digital post processing."
3,"The special effects are excellent; the story, passable.","Yes, this is yet another summer blockbuster disaster flick with an earth-shaking score and some rather amazing visual effects. This film is director/writer/producer Roland Emmerich's baby, and he does give the film some lavish attention to production. The story isn't too bad, even if it is absolutely unbelievable that the events that unfold happen all at once. Roland Emmerich, who's best film is still ""Stargate,"" but is mostly remembered for his mega-plex phenomenon, ""Independence Day,"" very nearly gets extra bases for ""The Day After Tomorrow."" However, the acting is wooden; the characters, two-dimensional. I could actually see myself watching this film again someday on a rainy afternoon, too feverish to care about acting or the story's plausibility; just soaking up the dazzling special effects and trying to ignore the rest. This is not a bad film, but it will be forgotten by next season."
3,It makes you think ...,"This movie explores various changes in weather patterns and how a change in ocean currents can have drastic effects. It also discusses global warming. I live in a continent that is currently going through its worst drought in centuries, while other parts of the world are soaked in rain. Both scenarios are considered part of the greenhouse effects, and results of damage we have done to our earth.The movie was great for the first half, impressive storyline and effects. But then the Hollywood formual stepped in, and we got bored. It became predictable and tended to drag on, not to mention how far-fetched it became.It's best point is that it makes you think ""will it happen, and if so, when?""Should be seen on the big screen to appreciate the stunning visual effects."
5,The Day After Tomorrow,"Exciting, interesting and stimulates thinking. Makes one think about first Ice Age and is another possible. What about a Heat Age from global warming?"
3,Brrrrrrr.....!,".....notice how the Vice-Prezzy in the movie resembles our current occupant, even down to the sneering unwillingness to listen to anything remotely scientific. Additionally, do you believe that Quaid could have survived the walk to New York (for his son) in the subzero arctic temperatures...? That's what makes it a piece of movie fiction, I guess. How come no one thought to fire up (really fire up) a nuclear reactor is beyond me. That would have melted those mutant ice floes for sure...to say nothing of creating genetic anomalies all over the joint...to say nothing of creating massive amounts of water everywhere. It is an entertaining though flawed and claustrophobic disaster flick that will hold your attention for a spell. I however think that if there were massive weather changes because of greenhousing and ozone depletion, we'd be more prone to fry in boiling temperatures...but I am no meteorologist..."
3,Not that great.,"I was kind of dissapointed with this movie. I thoght it was a little better than many reviewers say, but not much. It just doesn't have much of a story to it. The story is simple: a kid is trapped in New york, and his father tries to get to him. The problem: the story hardly seems to take place in the movie. You basically see the great CGI effects for about 5-10 minutes, then they go back to the story for about 2. So, this film was OK, but I have no intention of buying it."
3,Great special effects!,"The special effects for the mass destruction were great! Throughout the movie, I was impressed with the action and the depictions of devastation.The story, though, could use lots of work. My main problem with it was the focus on saving a small group of people, the main character's son and his friends. After seeing countless millions of people killed, the audience is supposed to be overly concerned about a handful of random folks? It's not like Armageddon or Deep Impact, where the lead characters are trying to save the planet. The movie would have been better off giving a broader view of Earth's survivors - which would also suit the title more."
2,CGI overload,"You'd never know that the special effects juggernaut that is the Day After Tomorrow was based on a book by Whitley Striber, but the one thing you will know is that the never ending surge of CGI enhanced weather disasters are brought to you by the same team that brought us the special effects turkey Independence Day. There's no point of going into the story since there isn't much of one to describe, just that Denis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal are wasted in their roles as a father and son who are caught in the middle of an end of the world-esque weather phenomina that catapaults the planet into chaos. Make no mistake that the CGI effects are a sight to behold, and the Day After Tomorrow can be taken as a guilty pleasure, but other than that it's as lame as it looks. Those who want a mindless escape may want to check it out, but even then you are better off with something else."
3,Scratched,This dvd was supposed to be in great condition but it has a bunch of scratches so it skips. It kind of kills the whole mood of the movie when the screen goes black. I guess that's to be expected with the price though.
1,Awful,"I couldn't take this movie, and had to turn away after a half hour or so. The acting is just par, the script is unintentionally hilarious (giant hail knocking Japanese unconscious on the streets of Tokyo could be mistaken for a great SNL skit, it's so funny), and the most overbearing, self-righteous eco-paternalism you have *ever* witnessed.Unless you are hopelessly enthralled with the eco-fascists, skip this one."
2,two is being generous,"this is quite possibly the worst piece of political tripe I have ever seen. global warming never looked so stupid on the big screen. unless, of course, you see this movie as a joke. In which case, this is actually an enteraining movie with such great quotes as ""the world is de-salinating"". the claims in this movie are so exaggerated and the images so foolish that it looks like a cartoon. Tornadoes in Hollywood? Hmmmmm. New york completely underwater within a matter of hours? It just makes you want to never trust hollywood's version of 'science' again."
2,Great effects......... awful movie,"I watched the movie thinkin thet it was gonna be great for the trailer.... when I was at the theatre, I was hoping for something interesting to happen...ANYHING!!! The effects were great, but the history....oh, no! maybe the DVD version may be better than the cinema version...I really wouldn't buy it. Also, the casting wasn't bad, but it wasn't good, it could have been absolutely better. if you buy the DVD, you really take the risk to be really disappointed! (i'm not joking, it's true!)"
2,"DVD-ROM Features Are ""Frozen""","Two stars for deceptive marketing. Perhaps this is how 20th Century Fox frustrates people into buying the two-disc version.This is a great movie and all that, but beware folks -- the promised extra hour or so of bonus footage is not actually on the disc. It contains a link to a web site where you can download the bonus footage...not a task you would be looking forward to if you didn't have a high speed Internet connection.And -- to add insult to injury, when I tried accessing the bonus footage recently (March 2011), I was presented with a message that said the web page could not be found.Perhaps the server that the bonus footage is stored on was hit by an ice storm and did not survive...."
5,awsome movie,"great movie, awsome detail. having problems playing movie smoothly on player, it hesitates every few minutes thru out the movie.i am working with samsung to fix this problem."
1,Stinky,"This is the stinkiest movie I have ever, ever seen, with the possible exception of Signs. This movie stinks. I was expecting lots of action, shooting, and people blasting away at ice. No. Most of it is just geeks sitting around in a library talking about their little lives. I mean, that's cool and all, but it thought this was supposed to be an ACTION MOVIE!I don't like the little romantic story that the writers HAD to add to attract teenage girls. Can't you have ONE movie without that claptrap thrown in? You might like this movie if you are a 14 year old geeky girl, who actually understands what theyr'e talking about half the movie, and will dig all that mushy goo-goo crap. Don't see this piece of garbage. It ain't worth your time or money."
4,a classic in SPECIAL EFFECTS and LOADS OF FUN,"I thought this movie was excellent for its special effects and the story line about global warming got me really interested in learning more. The characters were wonderful and while other reviewers didn't care for the plot let's face it the REAL story was the global warming storm itself!!! I saw it 8 times at the theater and my only criticism for the dvd is that any movie based on mostly special effects is always much better at the theater. I still watch it on dvd now and then. It was done almost like a documentary with a few characters and plot thrown in. I was very disappointed with this WIDE-SCREEN version, but that was all that was available when I bought it, hope you have better luck."
3,Basic intro.. not much content,This was not as informative as I had hoped. Other books by Amherst Media were more informative and better money spent.
1,Misleading Title - just trying to sell books,"J.D. Wacker has compiled information based on something, but it is hard to tell what that is. The title is misleading and inaccurate. If you are looking for a 'Master Posing Guide' or any kind of posing guide, this is not it. The pose on the cover is very nice, but is not even described in the book. Wacker refutes the title early on, explaining how he is going to reveal much more then posing techniques. He goes on to do little of this as well. Clearly, the cover art and title are intended to get you to buy. Though there is some practical information in the book, it is not a Master Guide to anything."
2,Not worth the money :(,"I didn't like it. I thought it would have pictures of poses, but most of it was reading. Things I already knew. I'am not a porfessional at all."
3,General topics covered. Simple,"This is a beginners book. Giving very general ideas on what type of poses you might use but no specifics. Talk generally about the common mistakes for different situation. Not a bad book, just simple."
1,.,Sunglass in picture are original not the replica you get. The replicas are cheap. Not even worth the $10 plus shipping I paid. They look of the same quality as those sunglasses sold in gas stations.
2,not so good,"The look and the fit of this item is good but the glass is bad. When I look at the ground with the glass on, the ground looks uneven and closer to me. I wouldn't recomment this even though it is cheap."
1,Uh....,"what is this??? I like some of Eliza Dushku's stuff and all, but i've like never heard of this and was wonderin' what it was..."
5,Best Cookie Sheets Available.,Way better than any others I have owned. Non-stick work very well. Good value.
3,"Not bad, not great","I have two issues with these pans:1. They don't hold their shape when heated. I bought these specifically because I thought they would retain their shape under heat. I was wrong.2. The product information sheet was glued to the sheet pans when I received them. The paper was easy enough to remove. The glue, however, was not. After numerous washings and careful scrapings, I still haven't removed all of the glue from the sheet pans.I guess I expected too much of these."
2,Disappointed,These cookie sheets are heavy and thick. I think they were advertised not to warp during baking. I was disappointed to find they do warp in the oven.
2,"Very basic, simple info. For the person who has never researched at all or has money to burn.","I kept seeing great reviews for this and thinking ""Well, the demo doesn't look like much, but based on these reviews I must be missing something.""That, along with the general excitement of pregnancy, caused me to finally get it.The demo is pretty much all it is.A simple, cartoon-ish fetus -- that, based on the ""future"" info of what the baby would like like -- only changes every couple weeks or so.Some trivia that you can find anywhere on the net is given every day (""the fetus can now suck it's thumb""). And that is it.Based on the package info I expected different, detailed info and (at minimum) more realistic (and frequently changing) fetal images.All in all, this is for the person who has never read even a passing chapter of a ""What to expect"" book, and who has never looked up any fetus pictures anywhere.Very simple and childish.In fact, give it to your other kids. It would be good for them, perhaps."
5,Absolutely Horrifying,"Quite frankly, I dont know whether to encourage you to rush out and buy this CD or to stay the hell away from it. I listened to this CD, along with some other Coil, one late college night, alone and in the dark, and it was easily the most horrifying listening experience of my life. The sounds these guys have created are quite maddening. In fact, if I were a religious man (which I'm not), I'd be willing to believe that How To Destroy Angels was created for doing just that. The sounds on this CD are not of this world; you'll be tempted to believe you are actually listening to a recording of Hell. Just make sure to have something suitably un-scary on hand after you get done listening so as not to slip into insanity forever =) I used Abbey Road.- Steve"
5,Eerie Ambient Masterpiece,"This was the first Coil album I got, and even though a lot of fans didn't like this one as much as L.S.D. or any other major Coil releases, they can't be compared. This one is quite amazing, much better even then the original H.T.D.A. This one compares better to Worship the Glitch, although this one is much more cohesive."
5,Inspiron 1501 battery Dell Lap Top,"This replacement battery was much cheaper than one from Dell, which the original battery needed to be replaced after three years. This replacement battery has a battery life of over 3 hours."
1,picture doesn't match battery from Computer,"The picture used for the product does not match the actual battery taken from the laptop... While it is close, there is a notch in the actual battery, and the fact that it is missing from the picture for the product makes me want to look elsewhere (it might not fit in the computer!)."
4,"Buen albun, variado en musicalizacion y con trazas acuaticas","Excelente vocalizacion. Por otro lado me gustaria saber de un albun anterior a Journey to the East, el cual no esta en el mercado. existira forma de acceder a él."
1,Huh?,"This video is extremly stupid. The animation stinks, the plots stink and the music. Ehh... the music repeats itself over and over and over. This coming from MST3K fan, folks! I don't why the people from Best Brains didn't choose this as a short.Steve: It's starting to rain!Tom (alligator, not Servo) : It's starting to rain!Crow: It's starting to get worse!Overall, this video just plains stinks! Younger kids will like this much, much better."
2,Bound to disappoint,"""Evening's"" official soundtrack is bound to disappoint on two levels:First, Claire Danes' version of ""Time After Time"" (yes, that's really her singing) is nowhere to be found.Second, the misleading trailer uses Dido's ""White Flag"" ('I will go down with this ship; And I won't put my hands up and surrender; There will be no white flag above my door; I'm in love and always will be')...I kept waiting for it to appear in the movie. Never happens. Even the most ardent fan of the movie (not many as it promises to disappear quickly after its $3.5M thud opening on 977 screens) will agree it gives the trailer a feel completely unconnected to what unfurls in the movie."
3,lovely soundtrack...but,"this is a beautiful soundtrack. However, if you're buying it to hear the version of Claire Danes singing...think again. It's not on the CD!"
5,Beautiful Music from a Perfect Film,"The soundtrack is as captivating as the film. I only wish they had included Claire Danes version of ""Time After Time"" as she performed it on screen."
3,Missing 'secret' tune,The trailer for this movie features the same music that features in 'The Secret'. Anyone know what it's called and whether or not if it's actually on this album? Listening to the samples I couldn't find it.
2,Claire singing..,"I too am searching for a version of the song where Claire is singing. If anyone finds, it please post. Thanks"
2,aaaaaaaaaahhhh! so much noise,"Do not buy!! This will cool down your processor only when it's at it's full speed, and it is too noisy.... you should look for a brand other than this. I bought this and now i will have to look for another one cus my processor is getting high temps and it is a really noisy fan."
1,I am looking for another CPU fan after having this one.,"I bought a gaming PC from a friend for $50. It has a Pentium-D (dual-core) at 2.6 GHz. This CPU fan was on the CPU when I got it. I haven't gotten around to getting a new CPU fan yet, but I have had enough of this fan! Even with my CPU usage at less than 1%, it's still loud. In fact, it's so loud, I hate turning this computer on anymore. The reason why I do is because it's the best computer I have right now. But after suffering through this loud noise for so long, I have decided to get a different CPU fan/cooling system. DO NOT get this fan."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Another of Ludlum's plots based on happenings during World War II. An order of priests have a secret document that they think could discredit a lot of basic christianity.The nazis and fascists want to get their hands on it. Lots of people's families die because of this, except one powerful man.The plot jumps to the seventies, and the race is on again to get this information, this time through the two sons of the man in question, who has died under torture. Now his sons come into conflict."
2,Just ok read,"Compared to Forsyth and Follett this a meager offering. The story seems to drag, at times I was wondering if the author was just padding the book. The plot is promising but the writing doesn't have the finesse to make it a real page turner."
3,Great potential that wasn't realized,"As a avid Ludlum fan, I was very disappointed by this book. The plot had so much potential and the backdrop was very well researched. Unfortunately, Gemini's characters are weak as Ludlum never develops them. Secondary characters are introduced and killed off without the reader ever becoming entranced by their roles. The novel jumps thirty years before I was satisfied with the first part and then concludes in such a way that was a disappointment. In addition, Ludlum never made me feel excited or nervous about what was in the vault and the potential devastation it could bring if found and exposed. He sort of through it in the readers face and moved on.There are much better Ludlum novels to read than this one."
1,Waste Of Time,"A big waste of time. The story wanders through several unlikely scenarios, over a period of 35 years. I kept reading, hoping that it would improve, finally reaching the last page but with no real ending. The author simply left his readers hanging."
1,Not good at all,"This book should have been a series as opposed to one book. Even though it is relatively short, I found it hard to finish. It spans over 35 years and so many characters that by the time you finish it feels like you've been through several books just to find out what happens (which you never really do). Several times I felt like the book is ending (good guy wins, bad guy loses) just to dive into a whole other story. All in all, I found it a painful read, and the first Ludlum book I did not like."
1,"Good book, awful display on Kindle","Applies to The Gemini Contenders [Kindle Edition]The book is brilliant, I have read the paper version before. Terrific story, marvellous plot, a real page turner. The hardcopy I would have rated with 5 stars. This Kindle edition is, however, awful. Just look at the preview and notice the many blank lines that are really annoying. Dont buy this version!"
4,Motorola Headphone B/T 2.0,"I initially, bought these headphones for running but did not realize that their size would make them unsuitable for active sports. However, I also play and listen to a lot of music and the sound quality from these headphones is phenomenal. The bass tones are rich and warm, while the mids/highs are well balanced but not piercing. The blue-tooth connection is good with the occasional drop-out when the battery is low. Generally, I have this hooked to my droid although I have used it with 1/8"" to Bluetooth transmitters too. All in all, very positive experience and I recommend this product for people who want quality sound in their headphones without out disturbing their surroundings. (great for office environment)"
4,My billet antenna!,Nice billet antenna..good price..probably could go cheaper..but it really was a nice antenna..got a compliment same day I put it on!
5,Wow. This is intense...,"I've used this and the Z3ta+2 and they are both amazing sounding synths.They come with awesome presets, so anyone not well versed in synth can still use this extremely easily. It also allows for an amazing amount of flexibility with sound creation.The UI is very yser friendly, (and the Z3ta+2's is slightly on the better side!) and its easy to learn how to do everything at a glance."
4,Informative and educational,"Mr. Womack takes the reader into his world in this book, sharing not only the exciting and dangerous moments of his career as a crew commander, but also the routine ones. He also puts a human face on part of the Cold War, reminding us that the members of the armed forces have families that they must take care of in addition to their military obligations and responsibilities.Mr. Womack shares enough technical information to make the book informative and educational without making it intimidating or difficult to understand. He also opens his personal life up to the reader, giving them a clear and complete picture of what it was like for him and many other military personnel during that era of the Cold War."
1,What a lame book this is...,Don't waste your time or money with this lame book.I bought it and wish i never did.It is so boring the only good part of the book is right up to when Womack got to launch a Titan missile otherwise besides that this book is a dud don't buy it.I don't need to know what this guy did on vacation or the fact that his station wagon kept breaking down-lame.I want to know about the missile itself.It's that sad so don't get this book i would reccomend Titan 2 a history of a cold war missile program now that is a history book you need to read.
1,"Personal account, but not worth buying or reading","Maj. Womack writes a personal view of his time as a Titan II commander. Unfortunately, it's in diary format and includes a lot of irrelevant and uninteresting stuff. I didn't expect great literature, but the book is not compelling at all.About 10 pages out of the about 150 are interesting. The two events worth reading about are when he and his crew actually launched a Titan II at Vandenberg AFB and a humorous anecdote about SAC's supertight security and confusion over the password and ""duress"" word used to gain or deny entry to the missile site.I hate to say it, but pass this one by and save your money for a copy of Titan II by Stumpf."
1,Buy Christmas Blues instead!,"I have long sought this album, and after waiting to get it from Japan, I was disappointed to see that it was with orchestral accompaniment. The orchestra smothers all the life out of Holly. If you are a fan of the sharp, earlier trio, and not so much of the later smoother Holly, avoid this. I will be getting rid of it. It is nothing like ""It Happened One Night, which is from earlier in the same year! Shark jumping, anyone??"
1,big big swindle from the seller,"I ordered a PREMIER JOURS PARFUM DE TOILETTE AND IT WAS A BIG BIG SWINDLE. In no place was it written that it was a miniature, And they said the weIght was 1 pound, so it was impossible to think that they were talking about a miniature bottle. I was sure it was the 1.7 oz bottle, and I received something ridiculously small, packed in a box the size of a shoe box. I feel totally cheated.And I will dispute this payment through my american express card.Lilian"
5,Amazing!,"These sheets have the perfect amount of gloss, they're constructed extremely well(not flimsy at all), and the perforations are immaculate. Just an amazing product.. worth every penny!"
3,Jewler's scale,I ended up purchasing two over a period of time. The first did not come with the weight to calibrate the scale so I ordered a second rather than hassle with the return. The second did come with the weight and calibrated nicely but when used on the first scale it did not. Still have both scales and still have not returned the first that came without the calibrated weight and still will not calibrate.
3,Buy it only if you don't have Loves Secret Domain,"Unless you really like these two songs, my favorite track is ""As Pure As?"", a really nice mix of ""The Snow""."
2,.,"I have to clarify that I only have the Snow EP, and consequently have not heard the Windowpane re-mixes. That said, this is pretty pathetic coming from a group as interesting as Coil. I have not heard tons of Coil but most of what I have heard was far more interesting than this. The actual track ""The Snow"" is a nice one, but basically this is all just sounds typical ambient-dance music with relatively uninteresting sounds and generic beats. A couple of interesting samples, I guess, but that's not enough. It's plenty listenable, but nothing special."
4,"Great music, French ou pas","My favorite song is Tu ne me pas laisse le temps--whether you can understand all of the French lyrics or not, this is great music. Upon mention of the name, many people think of the older Hallyday, his father--but this is not your parents' music! Good beats, nice lyrics, worth purchasing an international CD--also get raves from non-French speaking friends"
5,"Out there but oh, so enjoyable","This book is sharply, flippantly written and the story, though totally bizarre, is entertaining. You'll get lost in the world of high society dinners, drugs, death, pimples, sex, excess and Jackson Pollock. I read it nearly a year ago and the crazy story and images it provokes are still with me. It's hilarious, irreverent and just plain smart. Loved it."
5,"So far, so good...","This was the third temp gauge I tried, after one from AutoZone and one from Napa, and the only one that worked properly. Used to replace the temp gauge on a 1992 Jeep Wrangler. So far it's working very well."
4,Great video,"My daughter is 6 and loves Berenstain Bears. The stories are cute and don't ""hit her over the head"" with the moral of the story, but she gets it. Love the characters and it is nice to see that the shows our oldest watched are still around for our youngest."
2,Love the Bears 2,"This video has some really good episodes, though we like a couple of other DVD's better. Probably is partly due to the condition of the video when we received it. We ordered a used video which isn't the first time, however, this one came in a case with the center holder broken and the disk was sliding around in the case. When we opened it, there was a couple of major scratches on the disk and we couldn't view the last 3 episodes. A piece of tape on the center of the disk would have held it in place during shipment. Too bad, love those bears!"
3,Relaxing,Ideal for a travel agency to play in their office. If you wish to meditate and relax this is perfect for it. I was actually looking for a talking Bora Bora DVD. As an informational source to travel to the South Pacific.... this is NOT it!
3,"burning down the house, in spite of Brunnhilde!","This recording of Gotterdammerung is quite good, except for Eva Marton, who already seems to be past her prime as Brunnhilde. This is unfortunate, for the substantial immolation scene occupies the last twenty minutes or so of the opera and concludes the cycle. However, Haitink's conducting is very good. He gets the tempi correct, and there is an immediacy and urgency that keeps the performance going without being too fast. Hampson as Gunther is outstanding, and Marjana Lipovsek is also in very fine vocal form. Siegfried Jerusalem is very competent as his name sake. Overall a fine contribution to the many ring cycles out there. About the same quality as Janowski's and Barenboim's, but not as good as Karajan's, Levine's or Solti's."
4,"More, please.","This one could have been better. alot of the material is repeated from one disc to another. That said, it did contain some real gems and I do recommend it to anyone who likes intellegent humor in the style of Mort Saul, Bill Maher, etc."
5,A Wonderful Diversion,"Jack Paar was a wonderful talk show host, and the guests in the interviews are intelligent and...so wonderfully polite.After watching all the political rancor, it was so nice to pop in the interview disc and see democrats and republicans talking nicely about their opponents.God, I miss civility."
3,'Excuse me?' or 'What is that Sound and why am I tied up?',"This album doesn't make much sense.Coil are incredible musicians/soundscape artists/those who screw with headmeats, but the flow of this accentuates the disjointed and unfinished nature of all of the 'songs', and it can be less than pleasant. The whole album feels like a found-object art project, really, and while I like it, it's not up to their usual standards."
2,Not a very good album,"The only tracks I like on this album are Chickenskin and Soundtrap, those don't justify a purchase."
3,Hugo Stiglitz kicks some a**,"This is a very straightforward Mexican shoot-'em-up, with LOTS of action, right out of the gate, and so many bullets fired you can practically taste metal in your mouth.Hugo Stiglitz plays the hard-as-drop-forged-steel captain of an elite SWAT-style police unit, and the movie's narrative deals with his squad's efforts to defeat a group of bad guys who have taken over a bus full of hostages. The conclusion has few surprises, but it's action-packed and that's what you expect from a movie like this.You gets what you pays for..."
3,I Love This Game But...,"EA Sports Triple Play 2000 is a good game to play.It definitely is a hitters game. The only thing about most hits to the fence was, they were only singles. Even most of the fastest players couldn't get doubles in this game. If you keep using the power swing button, any one player could hit 2 to 3 homers a game, that's alot of long ball. If you create a pitcher not on the roster, he only has a fast ball, and no other pitch. If you decide to use rosters of the major league teams after the trades and demotions, you can only do 25 players. To some teams, that's the whole team."
1,Troubles troubles troubles,"Has anyone else experienced the nagging problems I have with Triple Play 2K? After playing a game using the keyboard, I lose control of the game and cannot access any of the commands on the screen such as ""next game""; the screen continues to scramble and it's only by chance that clicking on quit allows a new game by starting over.EA Sports was of no help in correcting this. This is the only software that acts like this on our computer. All of our drivers are current.The lack of support and response to this problem raises doubts that I will purchase the next version."
2,only read if desperate,"Okay, so girl cop goes undercover at a high school, falls for cute teacher, who in turn finds her intriguing as well... hasn't this been done before? Really, though, if it had been done better it still could have worked. It was a little too predictable, plus if a teacher comes onto me as his student, I don't care who he is - my respect level wouldn't just falter, it would nosedive."
4,Excellent Sound and picture!,This DVD is very good quality and sound. One of the best DVD's ive seen so far. Really cool lighting effects and awesome camera views! They should of included NO One Like You one of the top hit songs. Overall really good dvd!
2,Great sounding - poor performance,"I used to love The Scorpions. However, their recent works are poor. This DVD sounds great in DD and in DTS, but Scorpions lowered the songs tune 1/2 step. I don't like it because it is not being faithful to what was originally recorded by the band. Great songs such as Dynamyte, He's a woman she's a man, are part of an instrumental medley with no vocals and no guitar soloing. The members attitude is very weak and the ""Moment of Glory"" song sucks big time ! Buy it only if you are a big big fan of them."
2,Scorpions-Moment of Glory DVD,"Having been a long time Scorpions fan, I was eager to watch their new DVD release-Moment of Glory. Unfortunately, the live concert performance with the Berlin Philharmonic does not live up to its ambitious title. Though the video and sound quality on the DVD is superb, the Scorpions have lost their sting. Over embelished arrangements along with sub par guests, make this DVD ""Moment of Disappointment."""
2,For the paycheck,"SCORPIONS is working for the paycheck here, as a lot of old bands. Making a record with an orchestra is the previous necessary step for releasing an acustic record (what SCORPINS did!!!). No surprise...When new ideas are hard to come to the minds of old brilliant musicians like SCORPIONS, they need to release some sort of compilation...After all, they have bills to pay like all of us!"
4,GOOD BUT NOT the BEST THEY HAVE,"Well I enjoyed this dvd to a point, I think the over use of the orchestra took something away from the edginess of these guys.I am a big scorpions fan first seeing them in 1978 at Chicago fest and as such would have liked to see some of their older stuff played. I still enjoyed this dvd and would say get it if you like them at all. Klaus Meine still sounds good, but the kids choir sing along on a few songs really did not add anything. Anyway you still will get some enjoyment from this dvd just don't expect it to be the hardcore rock that is really the SCORPS !"
4,Captive Audience,"Once you buy in to the FasTrack you are hooked. Great idea , but really seems expensive. If you have the only game in town why not capitalize on the market."
3,Grantpa,Haven't installed yet so it is hard to write a good review. The need too many more words than I care to give
4,Vale la pena,"¡Me encanta la música de Joan Sebastian interpretada por Pepe Aguilar--en particular la canción ""Recuerdame bonito""!,"
2,Too narrow and pointy for chukkas,"Wouldn't fit my Clarks or Donald J Pliners. Too narrow and pointy, doesn't keep the leather tight. Would probably work for some ""real"" boots, but mine got returned."
2,Too small for XL,"the sizing chart states that an XL boot tree will fit a size 13 boot. however, the XL boot tree is just a little short for a size 13 boot and will not stay in place."
5,This ia a must have,"If you have quality boots, you need to have quality boot trees. I have a pair of Tony Lamas and a pair of Justins, that I meticulously care for. These trees help my boots maintain their shape, and the cedar just plain looks and smells good. Regarding size, go large/extra large unless you're a lady. I wear size 10-1/2 boots, but I bought the largest size boot tree they offer, and it fits perfectly due to the spring tension. These trees are solid and reliable. As stated,if you have good boots and want to keep them for the long haul, you need these trees."
1,"Unless you have extremely narrow feet, don't buy these.","The Woodlore Men's Boot Tree is not remotely close to the sizing advertized. They run very small and, in my opinion, are so narrow they could not be considered ""Men's"". Even ordering a couple sizes up would not resolve the problem of being so very narrow. I definitely would not reccomend them to anyone."
4,Does the trick,We use a lot of these as we do a lot of soldering they do the trick. Order came quickly.
4,Love it,"iwould recommend it and will buy it because it is Weller, have always used their products and had good luck."
5,Worked perfectly,The new tip worked great and fit my ancient weller 40W soldering iron. Hard to believe that my 20+ year old soldering iron can still get replaceable tips.The iron still works great after all these years.
5,Conical Solder Tip,I bought this solder tip as a replacement for an existing one. It worked just fine for the small electronics work that I'm doing right now.
4,Nice Product Power a little Lacking,"I got it for 130$ with a 30$ mail in rebate. It works fine no problems very easy to use and setup instructions are good, only thing really lacking is a picture of ideal placement of speakers although it has a detailed description, so it was no problem. Came with an optical cable to connect to PS2 (and many other extra cables that you might need), and i connected and watched panic room w/ DTS and it was AWESOME. The only thing is that its 48watts. but for the price and being that its analog AND digital (unlike the Creative 5200, 5300) its really worth the price. I would deffintly recomend it to my friends"
5,"Great for Xbox or PS2, makes GTA: Vice City *ROCK* !!",output and quality of sound well above average. Plug Playstation 2 into decoder using optical cable (provided) and get DTS games (like Grand Theft Auto: Vice City) for the gaming experience of a lifetime!
3,Cover version,"This CD is essentially a studio cover version of the songs of the Rio Grupo Especial samba schools for carnaval 2000. The actual musical arrangements written by the samba school masters have been completely ignored and instead a bland watered down studio arrangement has been used. This is the official recording, which means that the actual versions which were heard in the Sambodrome in carnival 2000 have been lost to posterity; a cultural crime in my eyes. However if you just want to learn the songs they are all here, with the words, and if you are not a Rio bateria fan you probably will be happy enough with this collection. It all sounded nothing like this in reality though."
3,2000,"this year will be an excellent year. The best songs go out to Grande Rio, Caprichosos, Ilha and Beija-Flor. Some schools lacked the emotion. Carnval 96 and 98 were the best."
4,"Not what she normally writes, but pretty good!","Golden Threads is a quick read, and also a good read. The book turns out to be a page turner, you care about the characters - you want to know what happens to them. It is nothing like the books she writes currently, such as the other ""new"" book out ""Sleeping with Fear."" I think some Hooper fans would be disappointed in that. She explains on the DJ flap that it is a earlier novel that is more romance than mystery and suspense, but it definitely has a mystery in it. I thought it is worthy of reading. The only thing I found somewhat annoying was the overwrought way the two characters reacted to one another. Cat lovers should know that a super smart siamese plays a big part in this novel!"
3,Epilogue?,The story was very simplistic. What is confusing is the epilogue. What is that all about???
2,Not one of her best,"I usually love Kay Hooper's books, but this book is not my favorite. The book is so boring with a flat plot. Too many coincidence. I don't feel like I want to continue reading the book."
4,Good romance,"This is a great author and her romance writing is very enjoyable. However, her paranormal stories are outstanding and this come no where near the quality of the mysteries and paranormal themes."
3,Battery eater,"I got this for a present. Not sure I would have purchased it for myself. I don't use the swing speed stuff that much. Never could figure out how to make the best use of it. I know already when I swing too fast! I do use the scoring function often. It does provide some useful info but the PC based part of the process leaves a bunch to be desired. It does not do a good job of presenting information in the way you would find valuable. You have to did around to get at what you want. The transfer mechanism is also a bit erratic. The worst problem is that it eats batteries. I play about 3 times a week and I don't get much more than 6 weeks out of a battery. Considering the written material says 6 months, something is not all it should be.In summary, a good idea with a lot of very rough edges."
2,Used twice- sheds bristles - loses shape- smells odd,"Once I put the brush under the faucet, it smelled strange (like a wet animal). I thought adding soap would help take away the smell...that only made it smell like soap and the strange smell. After using it twice I noticed many bristles laying in the bathtub afterward. The bristles also lost their shape and flattened out. When scrubbing my back the second time I felt a slight burn...am I scrubbing that hard? I don't think I would reccommend this to a friend."
2,good price but too strongly scented,Would be better if it was unscented. Way too stong an odor. That's the risk you take when buying an item online that you've never tried before.
4,Very useful addition to the Sierra Climber's library,"Croft has such stature in the climbing world that by mere inclusion of a Sierra route in this book, he will define it as a classic for the next generation of climbers. We bought this book in an East Side climbing shop en route to the Sierras to bag classic climbs, and found it very useful. The topos aren't up to modern standards (e.g., ""Supertopos""), but there is enough detail to get an experienced climber up most of these routes. The major contribution is to identify the classic routes of the range, something he is highly qualified to do. If you plan to do much technical climbing in the High Sierra, buy it."
3,not a balanced mix,"I liked this cd when I heard the first time, at home. It went with dinner nicely, although I wasn't paying too much attention. But I was disappointed in the car, trying to pad an all-day solo drive, upon being repeatedly forced to turn the volume first up, then way down, as the overly-loudly-mixed vocal (female rather nicely reading Shakespeare) entered the soundscape rather unpredicatably and intermittently, definitely blaring compared to the other tracks. This actually hurt my ears at one point. I had the excellent background up loud enough to enjoy it (not extremely loud) when look out, there she is, no warning, aaagh, why is THIS passage even LOUDER than the other vocal blurbs?...leap for the volume knob...but then you can't hear the background any more... I'll try again at home I suppose. Nice sounds though, Coil."
3,Sounds like Fleetwood Mac?,"1) XM 52 The Verge's favorite band of late - every track here has seen substantial airplay.2) Wow!! Three-eighths an epicly great debut album. Best is ""Set Us Free"" - it sounds like a Fleetwood Mac on the rise, back when they were good. Other Eisenhower efforts are ""Heart of Snow"" and ""Druganaut"". Three very different songs - not a tightly defined band like Evanescence. However, the other three tracks, while not bad, I find forgettable."
3,It's worth checking them out!,"I saw Black Mountain live, they were actually the opening band for Coldplay. They were pretty good, nobody heard about them but 20,000 people that were there actually liked them. It's worth checking them out."
1,huh? Black Sabbath meets Neil Young?,"I'm a huge Black Sabbath fan. I hear nothing in Black Mountain that even remotely resembles BS. This CD really sucks if you are a hard rock fan. It is soft, folksy, crap. To me it sounds like the Mammas and the Pappas meet the Partidge Family."
3,good and a half,"A friend of mine told me there are a slew of interesting new bands and has been spoonfeeding them to me.Black Mountain is one. I got this and found a nice mix of hard rock, some textural experiments, and fine male female vocal pairings. Basically, this is a good rock and roll album, done by one of the few who know how such albums should sound"
3,"Good, but go for ""In The Future""","Black Mountain's self titled first album shows a strong example of what the band can become, but it doesn't show much on this album. Songs like ""Don't Run Our Hearts Around"" show the band's Black Sabbath blues side but the other songs drone on with a Pink Floyd feel (not putting down Floyd, just the way Black Mountain did the songs)In my opinion, their second album ""In The Future"" shows many more influences and it reflects in their music."
3,"Well written, thoughtful work!","Only just started reading this work. Yes, I know, I should wait ;) So far, have found to be very well thought out and carefully written."
1,Influence or Plunder?,"It may very well be that no one cares about a mediocre band (Collective Soul) taking direct 'musical inspiration' from an almost unknown band (Masters of Reality). Call it what you will, but anyone who has ""Sunrise on the Sufferbus"" by Masters of Reality will know exactly what I'm talking about. Influence? I think not, just listen to Master's song 'Rabbit One' and take a wild guess as to which Collective Soul was born. Listen for guitar tone, variance, riffs, even vocal patterns throughout the Master's album. The only thing missing from Collective Soul right now is some inventiveness and Ginger Baker."
2,what happened?,"I have seen CS live four times and each time they were incredible. Unfortunately the raw energy and looseness that's on stage does not carry over on to their CDs. Dosage rocked pretty hard but Blender is a bunch of formula pop rock. Sounds like CS is playing it safe or listening to the wrong A&R folks. CS are loaded with talent, they just need to hook up with the right producer who can strip away all the studio effects and let them rip. How about Rick Rubin, or Billy Corgan who is probably searching for a new gig about now."
2,blender?,collective soul had a few nice attempts toward pop music like dosage. The main problem i have with this album is none of the songs are hits so no airwaves and the fact that the album probably has about 7 fillers! Its just to flawed to recommend to everyone it may be if you are a diehard collective soul fans. i wouldnt lose this album but i wouldnt buy it again.
1,Dissapointing Followup To Dosage,"I have been a fan of Collective Soul since their very first album was released. This time around, it seems as if the band is taking a step back in time to be more of an old-fashion rock-n-roll group, and this somehow doesn't seem to suit their instrumental or singing style. None of the songs I found were melodic or moving enough than their previous album ""Dosage"" (""Needs"" was an amazing tune). Truly a dissapointment for me."
3,Dosage pt2,"This album is a little dissapointing, when compared to the bands previous releases. It fails to live up to their last album, ""Dosage"", and doesn't have any of those classic hits that will always be remembered like ""Run"" or ""The World I Know"". Collective Soul has set a high standard for themselves, and well this album is still worth a listen, it doesn't live up to that standard. For the most part the tracks are pretty bland with the exception of a few. The third track and first single off the album ""Why pt2"" carries some of the bands previos more aggresive sounds from songs like ""Heavy"" and ""Gel"" but isn't as memorable. While the bands previous albums showed definate progression both musically and lyrically, while maintaining their patenated sound, ""Blender"" sounds more like ""Dosage pt2""."
3,Their weakest album...,"Being a Collective Soul fan since basically the beginning, this was their first CD that I'm not crazy about. Their last album ""Dosage"" was brilliant, so I had high hopes for Blender. After hearing it there are definitely a few good songs, but most of them are pretty bland and not up to the standards they set themselves with previous albums. Where were the string sections in the ballads for Blender?! I miss those, and having a guest appearance by Elton John was definitely a total mistake. Nobody wants to hear that fat gay clown sing on a Collective Soul song, believe me.Basically this CD is worth having for certain good songs, but I find it hard to believe that anyone would prefer this album over Dosage or their Self Titled albums (their best work). I can only hope that Collective Soul take their time and create another stand-out album next time around."
4,Collective Soul blends again,"Since Collective Soul has so many talents, why not use them? The groove laden ""Skin"" and ""Vent"" start the album. Other standout songs include the classic-rock influenced songs ""Tokyo,"" ""Perfect Day,"" and ""Why Part 2,"" which adds punch with a stinging riff. ""You Speak My Language"" is bordering on metal, and is packed with energy from the vocals too. It doesn't really fit with the other songs, but it shows that Collective Soul can rock hard with the best of them. ""Turn Around"" is a pretty, folk influenced song like their song ""Run"" from Dosage. The album doesn't show a lot of range with the running times, and that is a drawback. The album's also a bit samey in the lyrics. But overall, it's another very solid album for Collective Soul."
5,"As usual, Collective Soul creates a true work of art","Wow. That was what I said after my first listen. I can see Perfect Day (with Elton John!) being a hit right away. But like all of their work, it is the album as a whole, not the individual songs that stand out. Compared to the earlier works, I would say this one is heavier with a definite BEAT. If you like Collective Soul, you will like this. If you don't, you should still give it a try. Think I'll go listen to it again."
2,CSoul sells out,"if you liked the first 3 csoul albums but you were a little disappointed by dosage. don't buy this. collective soul seems to no longer care about making good music but only about getting hits on TRL for MTV. they might as well be put in the same category as the backstreet boys or other trash that is driven by a bands image; not the music. whatever happened to songs like ""the world i know,"" ""december,"" and ""blame."" they are now a band for young teenage girls who can post the album cover with the band members pictures on their walls. two decent songs are ""why pt 2"" and ""perfect day"" but don't come close to comparing with songs from the second or third album."
3,Collective soul-turning pop?,"I have been a fan of collective soul for a very long time. i have all of their cd's, and i must say that this one sounds like it was just jumbled together without thought, just to keep them fresh in their minds. this album leans toward pop, with heavy drum beats and modern-rock guitar. why pt. 2 is the best collective soul song in a long time, but there isnt that much more on this album. like their last album dosage, they failed to make something very significant. but dont get me wrong, its a pretty good cd. but personally my fave from them is Disciplined Breakdown."
2,Blender? Try Blander,"I was so excited to get this album, being the huge Collective Soul fan I am. I just finished the first listen, and the most exciting part was opening the wrapper. It's not horrible, but it is mostly forgettable. Spend your money elsewhere, you can wait to hear someone else's copy. It saddens me to have said this."
5,My highest praise.....,"This is, and has the feel of, their favorite CD to date. You can tell from tracks like skin, vent and why pt. 2 that they thoroughly enjoyed themselves throughout the entire recording process, from gathering daily in their regular rehearsal space to writing and recording. You will be able to feel that warmth and happiness through the music.This time, they wanted to have a little more fun, enjoy the process. The open door policy they had led to cameo appearances from assorted family and friends, including some of Atlanta's leading musicians, such as Shawn Mullins, and Butch Walker and Jayce Fincher of the alt-pop combo Marvelous 3. Elton John (a devoted fan of ColSol) makes an appearance as well, playing piano and sharing lead vocals with Ed on Perfect Day, a very soft and beautiful song. All in all, i rate this CD at the top of my list. From track 1 to the end, it just seems to 'blend'........ i love it, i am so glad i bought it."
4,Unified Conscience,"This Cd is apropriately titled. It mixes in elements of pop & electonic influences, the standard Collective Soul with great success. The lyrics on You speak my language, Vent, & Why pt. 2 were themes and feelings that I can identify with. Using the clavinet on Vent like Generate on Dosage was great. The changing of style and tempo between & within song was a new & enjoyable twist. After the group did a cover of Ozzy Osbourne's Crazy train at their last concert, I was skeptical of Perfect day. The aforementioned collaboration with Elton John was great and could turn out to be a huge success. Overall, I highly recommend this CD."
4,Awesome!!!!,"I lov this cd!! I've only listen to it a couple of times, but I already lov the songs! Great mix of touching slow songs, and in your face rockers. These guys know how to make albums. and its only been a little over a year since their last release, so they are vrey talented to write good songs all the time, unlike some bands who need four years to write a new album. Here is a TRULY TALENTED BAND!!!"
3,Decent Soul,"This is a pretty good album by Collective Soul. As compared to some specific songs on Dosage that completely blew me away, there really isn't any songs on Blender that really get to me in the same way. They are all very solid songs, no real standouts though. The tracks that I find hitting repeat on are Turn Around, Boast, and After all. Overall a very good album. Only downside is that there are no breakout hits like on the past album... kinda dissapointed with that."
2,My least favorite of all,"I'm a long-time Collective Soul fan. My two favorite albums would be their self-titled sophomore release, followed by Dosage... good writing, excellent music - all around great efforts.Every time I've ever listened to Blender, I wonder, ""what happened?""This album disgusts me more and more every time I've heard it. I finally reached a point where I refused to listen to it, and have finally opted to disregard it all together.The mixing/studio-work was good... but the lyrics are pretty lame, in my opinion... and the music does nothing but annoy me. I never thought I'd say that about a band I consider one of my top five favs of all time, but this album has done nothing but left a sour impression on me."
4,Another Solid Effort,"This album has a lot of the key elements that have made C.S. one of the great rock bands of the last decade. Great guitar, vocals, and enjoyable melodies. However, their sound is a lot fuller on this album than previous projects, perhaps due to a greater use of synthesizers. Enjoy the ride."
5,Infectious Head Bopping ahead,"I bought ""Dosage"" because the morning dj's I listen to kept playing ""Heavy"" for bumper music. I bought ""Blender"" because ""Dosage"" made me a confirmed Collective Soul fan. I was not disappointed. From the first track, ""Skin"", my head began to bob along and that is always a good thing. Now I find I hear ""Skin"", ""Why, pt 2"", ""Ten Years Later"", and ""Over Tokyo"" in my head at various times during the day. ""Perfect Day"" is a great duet with Elton John, Ed Roland's voice compliments his voice very well. This is one album I listen to daily.Collective Soul is good, solid power pop. And that's okay by me!"
4,Underrated continuously,"Collective Soul continues to be underrated after yet another awesome release. Although I don't think the cd is long enough, it packs in future classics as the previous four cds have done. I've yet to hear a song from this band that is poor. It would be very difficult for them to create a greatest hits package (although i hope they don't do this for a long time)."
4,CLASSIC COLLECTIVE SOUL MEANS MORE OF A UNIQUE BAND,"I think the reviewer for Amazon is way off on this album, and is laboring from an undue disdain for 70's rock, of which (by the way), this offering from Collective Soul is not remotely reminiscent. CS's Blender is much like their other albums, largely in that their songs don't fit any one mold or stereotype. If you like previous CS, you should like this. If you like a truly unique sounding, tight band, you will like this CD. I refrain from giving it 5 stars because (a) the album is a little short and (b) that rating is limited to virtually earthshattering CD's. Four stars, however, means a solid album indeed."
2,Blender = Bland,"compared to their first 4 albums, this was a huge dissapointment, there are a few ok songs but overall it is very bland..."
1,Collective Dissappointment,"For anyone expecting an album on a par with Collective Soul's previous albums, you are bound to be dissappointed. The lyrics are droning and repetitive. The instrumentals trend towards some kind of techno sound.In my opinion, their records kept getting better until this one."
5,Excellent,"This is a melodic, slightly electronic collection of hard rock tracks and ballads. Positive lyrics for the most part, too. This is one of those CD's that you can just let play, and while none of the songs compare to the hit ""Shine,"" the consistency of the sound makes this album a notch above their other ones just because they seem to have developed a clear direction for their sound. They have settled into a great album-rock band, with a newer sound applied to classic 70's rock melodies. ""Skin,"" ""Why"" and the haunting ""Turn Around"" are some highlights, but there are only two poor tracks on the whole disc out of 11. Ed Roland has to be perhaps the greatest alt-rock vocalist today, vastly underrated songwriter as well. Collective Soul CD's are never instant classics, but they have a way of growing on you and man do they sound great live!!"
2,A bit of a flop,"Smoke and Mirrors was not to my taste. I found a few gems in the book, for for the most part I found the collection to be a bit much to swallow. Many of the stories simply fell flat, and the, er, poetry, was simply painful. As a whole, the collection made me feel like I was back in Freshman Creative Writing (which, coincidentally, is where I first heard of Neil Gaiman, as so many of my classmates cooed over the brilliance of American Gods).Gaiman is typically hit-or-miss for me, and this volume just happens to be a strong ""miss."""
3,Meh....,"This book was my introduction to Neil Gaiman as I've had a few friends rave about his work and so was curious to read some. I found this and one other book (Coraline) in a box and decided to read this one first.Eh, I can't really say I enjoyed it. It took me a while to get through it, mostly because quite a few stories were either hard to digest, hard to follow, or boring. There were a few gems that kept me interested, but that's about all I can say for this book. After reading a few other reviews I think I will read another of Neil Gaiman's books, preferably a novel, before I give up on him."
