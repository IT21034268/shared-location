1,you get what you pay for,It is way too flimsy and doesn't mount to walls very well. But you get what you pay for.
1,"The cheapest, flimsiest thing I have ever purchased","Received it via FedEx around 5pm this afternoon and promptly filled out an RMA to send it back to Amazon. This thing is easily the flimsiest, most poorly constructed product I have ever seen. It wouldn't stop our cat from getting where I didn't want our kid going. Highly disappointed."
2,Their Best Songs Here - But Do You Really Want The Rest?,"""July Morning"" is hands down the best piece of song in the Uriah Heep canon - but do you really want to slog through the remainder of the usual Uriah heap (excluding the title track, which is about as good as this band could get for a pure stomp-rocker) in order to get there? On the other hand, I'd still like to know how Manfred Mann played that colourful synthesiser solo which closes out ""July Morning"" without having to be sedated..."
3,On the verge of greatness a tremendous lp,"This album was the perfect table setter for the success the band was about to embark on. This CD probably one of the greatest tracks in ""I Wanna Be Free"" in that it combines a unique contrast between soft and hard rock within the same song which was a trademark for their style at the time. Take it from a Heepster from way back you wont be dissapointed with this one!"
3,Blast from the past (what I remember of it) but flat on CD,"My college freshman year roommate introduced me to Uriah Heep, and a lot of other things legal and otherwise. I hadn't heard this for decades and parted with the vinyl years ago, so ordered the CD. Poetic metal still at it's best, but the audio wasn't quite there--just kind of cold and flat on the CD. I recently ordered the vintage vinyl to put on the turntable from an online auction and I'm expecting it to flood my ears with the rich vocals that set this group apart from most all of the metal imitators that followed."
3,"some great tunes, some awful","I have listened to this since I was a freshman in college (1971)and still enjoy some of the music today. this cd is much better sonically than any album I ever owned of this music. and while there are a couple of really bad songs on the album, the title song and July Morning are worth the price of admission. Look At Yourself is the highlight of the record with some great percussion at the end of the song."
5,Top Of The Heep,"No doubt Uriah Heep's best effort. Why? Ken Hensley had yet to emasculate Mick Box's full frontal electric guitar assault and take control of the band.While Box is no Blackmore or Iommi, his tone and in your face playing was as good as any hard rock guitarist of the era. Of all the David Byron era albums, ""Look At Yourself"" showcases Box's talents both wonderfully & wickedly. Plus this album contains two of Uriah Heep's best songs ""July Morning"" & the title track ""Look At Yourself"".While the overall songwriting is not as consistent as the ""Demons And Wizards"" album, ""Look At Yourself"" is Heep's ""killer metal"" album as is Deep Purple's ""Machine Head"".If you can afford to add both to cart, purchase this along with ""Demons & Wizards"". Then follow with ""Live 1973"" which could also be titled ""Greatest Hits Live""."
5,It's Heep,What can I say? I dropped acid to this more times than I can count. Killer. Took me back to ALL of the good times.
5,good & fast,"The Avery labels were just what I needed--reasonably priced, easy to print on and use. Amazon did a great job in getting them to me quickly, too."
5,Excellent vignette on difficulties of interfaith marriage,"This is an amazingly well presented collection of interviews that were conducted with people that were involved in an interfaith marriage. The author breaks down the interviews into those who are raising children Jewish; raising them Christian; raising them with both religions; other alternatives; and lastly, those marriages where one spouse converts to the religion of the other.Although each interview ranges from a few pages to about 8, the full range of emotions come out which show the hurt from the family of the spouse; sometimes the hurt from the spouse; and the frustration at trying to be even-handed and finding out how difficult it really is.Although I am of the camp that feels that interfaith marriage can't work, I would consider this required reading if only for the range of situations that are covered and how each couple handles them."
4,NYC noise rock at it's finest,"Chris Spencer and Co. rip it up on this disc. ""Sick"" is a personal favorite. See them live if you get the chance!"
5,UNSANE ROCKS!,"NYC's Unsane is one of the best hardcore bands out there. And they have been out there for a while, too. Cheyenne, Wyoming was lucky enough to witness them live, when One Legged Pup productions from Laramie was able to get them to come and play and the best bands from around the area even got to play with them. But when the dust settled from the first two bands, which was a mighty heavy set, and the lead singer-guitarist hit a chord for the first time, I thought to myself, these guys are professionals. No question about it. It was one of the tightest sets I had ever seen. That is until I saw them in Ft. Collins two days later. I hadn't heard but a few cd's before I saw the show, but a friend of mine, Justin Keeler, purchased the picture disc vinyl of Occupational Hazard and we listen to it all the time. Their current drummer is none other than Vinny Signorelli from Swans fame and he should stick around cause the three of them are one hell of a team!"
4,Very good for dancing salsa,"I don't know much about theory of (salsa) music or the singer Chino Espinoza, but this is one danceable CD. Not too fast or too slow for salsa, and with perfect amount/strength of claves. If you like, for example, Sonora Carruseles, I think you'll like the artist, too. A bit more modern than Carruseles (less retro fravour) but equally danceable.One complain is that I don't like ""Yeah!"". There are two versions of them! I guess those who love reggaeton appreciate the song but I don't simply because it is not a good salsa dancing song. Or maybe I am tired of this song.Finally, I like the new album, ""Maria"", better. I hope he will produce a lot of danceable CDs in the future."
4,Great little dresser,The dresser fits our needs perfectly. It was delivered intact without any problems. My only concern is that the wood is very soft and easily scratched. I will invest in coverup markers! It is perfect for the nursery.
2,"good music, lousy vocals","The vocals destroy this. I like extreme vocals, but these are just garbage. There is plenty of negative energy on this release."
5,The Today is the Day Album,"This is their full realization of what they have been going for. The previous albums built up to this, and the subsequent albums meandered and eventually lost focus, but it all came together here.A concept album from beginning to end, this includes everything from the trademark weird/offensive lyrics, to the stacatto metal riffing, the heaviness of Black Sabbath, the fuzzy production, the movie samples, and plenty more. Everything that Today is the Day seems to always strive for, but it comes together perfectly on this release. It's a journey that spends more than an hour taking you through their twisted, dark world.It might take a while to grow on you, but it's worth it.Highly Reccomended."
4,"""Interesting Listen""","This is the first album I purchased by ""Today Is The Day"", and I must say, ""Interesting listen"". Creative metal music fresh to my ears, I got hooked. This particular album blends psychedelic sounds into doom like metal, adding some wicked vocals by Steve Austin. The first song ""Temple of the Morning Star"" begins with an acoustic sound with overlayed vocal. At the end, the last song is an extended electric version of ""Temple of the Morning Star"", which feeds into ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" at approx. 4:45. Very well done!"
4,Useful Wisdom,"With reflections on his own life and not too subtle advice on how life should be lived, Player offers up a no-nonsense approach to life that can be applied certainly to non-golfers. He is clearly passionate about the game, a generous and magnanimous person, and charmingly opiniated with his South African personality coming through loud and clear."
3,The Golfer's Guide to the Meaning of Life,This book was purchase for my 17 year old grandson to give him a positive direction of life.
2,Made up facts,"Contains quite a few made up things that would make good analogies, but are presented as facts. Many of these claims aren't sepcifically attributed to any source, although the book has a ""further reading"" list of about 50 books. The author goes so far as to try to explain in detail how all these things work. For example, the soul is explained to be residing in a cavity near the heart. It explains that the soul passes messages back and forth from the brain via the central nervous system. This essentially means that anyone paralyzed from the neck down has no soul, according to the author. Overall, I found some useful information in the book, though most of it wasn't and it one needs to wade through ""facts"" to find what's actually useful."
1,"Disjointed, badly written book.","I was interested in a different perspective on the 12-Step program, which has been used for (besides alcoholism), cluttering, drug addiction, and weight control, among other conditions.This book was so badly written, I couldn't finish it. Glad I borrowed it from the library.Also, I generally don't make a habit of reading the ""Acknowledgments"" chapter in books, but in this one I did. Be forwarned: the author was apparently a fan of Seth, Ramtha, Zarathustra, Mafu, and Rajni--all various ""beings"" who are ""channeled"" by various and sundry individuals--if they are not your cup of tea, this book has nothing for you."
1,The Author's Latest Book Negates This One,"How unfortunate that Grabhorn's latest book, Dear God! What's Happening To Us? negates any positive messages or information from THIS book.In her latest, she admits to ""drinking again after four decades of sobriety"" and, worse, she blames it all on a group she calls ""The Others"". Where's the Self-Responsibility? Where's the Trust in the HIGHER Power?Too bad. It's a shame she's choosing to self-destruct her writing career. Hopefully, enough bad reviews of her newest book will get her to (once again) seek the help she needs with her alcoholism."
4,A good addition to the 12-steps,If you've finished working the steps (I know we never truly finish) and you are still lost then this book might help. It's quite revealing and easy to read. I read it because I tend to load it out and wanted to be certain it was the kind of book I wanted to share with others. It definitely is.
1,Avery 5386 Rotary Cards 3X5 Cards/Sheets,"I don't know how they dare to call these paper thin sheets ""cards"". They are no better than a sheet of printing paper. The word ""Card"" gave the impression that it would be something with more substance, like the Rolodex Cards, not these flimsy, card wannabes. However, when I contacted Avery, they were very apologetic and offered replacement. While they may have this one inferior product, I've used other Avery products in the past and they were acceptable, some even good. Avery has EXCELLENT customer service and they appear to really care abt what customers think. Kudos to Avery!"
4,Avery Rolodex cards,"They are Avery rolodex cards to be printed from the computer. Not much to say other than they work well and look good These are the only larger rolodex cards I could find If you need them in the future, you better buy them now before they become extinct."
1,Flimsy.,I purchased these because we have an older rolodex at work that requires cards this size. I was not interested in being able to print them from my computer. I found them to be very flimsy and I know that once I tore them apart & put them in the rolodex they would not hold up. I returned them.
5,A great book about the motorcycle journey of a lifetime.,"Zero to Sixty is a great story about a motorcycle trip around North America. It tells of the whole trip and throughout the book splits off to tell of what led up to it. How he started on a bike with playing cards tied to the fork to make it sound like a dirt bike and how he progressed to a Harley. I liked this book because it was realistic and interesting. There were problems to solve, memories to recolect and some parts were just left to the imagination. Gary Paulsen once again uses his great skill as an author to captivate the reader's attenion throughout the book."
4,an excellent personal adventure,"For anyone who loves a personal adventure store stoey this is it. Its amazing what someone can accomplish. This story of Gary Paulsens personal adventure is like no other. Its exciting, fast and full of life. This is the third book I have read by the author and eveyone has been an adventure for me."
3,Check out Mi Moto Fidel: Motorcycling Through Castro's Cuba,"I had hoped for more from this book, which failed to hold my interest, despite being less than 200 pages. It's not a dud, however, but if you want an exciting read check out ""Mi Moto Fidel: Motorcycling Through Castro's Cuba."" I read this in one sitting, finishing about 4 a.m.! It's a fascinating and sometimes hilarious, sometimes hair-raising story of a 7,000-mile journey and justifiably won both the 2002 Lowell Thomas Award ""Travel Book of the Year"" and the North American Travel Journalist Association's Awards of Excellence ""Grand Prize."""
3,Great until the Flash broke,"I received this camera as a gift. After one roll of film the flash stopped working. I tried replacing the battery, no go. So far everything else still works. The camera takes AWESOME pictures though. I was so excited that it had a flash because I have a super sampler that I always thought would be better with a flash. I guess I will try taking it to the camera repair man next. Since it was a gift I think it would be worth the $ to try to fix. I hope they don't laugh at me!"
3,"Fun, cheap, but breaks easily.",I enjoy using the Pop9. Superb fun at parties and such; but they do tend to break easily. Consider the camera more as a expensive throw-away novelty item you will not be disappointed.
4,It really works,"I just opened my new Pop 9 and was a bit surprised. It's made of cheap gold plastic- REALLY cheap. The ""lens cap"" has a tiny plastic handle to pry it off- it's already almost broken off. The film is a little tricky to engage too. However, I just got back my first set of prints, and they're great! Not a blurry shot in the bunch, no matter how close up I took the photo. The view finder is off-kilter, but after one roll you can pretty much see how to adapt. I love it! Fun fun fun. I can't wait to take more shots. There are so many possibilities with this camera!"
1,big disappointment,"Shutter button broke during first roll of film. I also purchased Fisheye, which I managed to shoot with a little longer (about 10 rolls), before the flash stopped working. Overall, it's a waste of money. I woul never think about writing such a negative review, because I love Lomo pics, but these cameras break too soon."
1,Not worth the money,"I would give this camera 0 stars if that were a choice. I purchased this camera and didn't even make it through four shots before the shutter stopped working. When it arrived it looked cheaped and fragile and felt the same way. I wish I could recommend the Lomo Pop 9, because I really like the concept behind it, but after owning this own and having similar problems with the Oktomat, I would say save your money."
1,Camera not as described.,"First of all, the camera I purchased did not match the product description on amazon.com. The package says it is the Vivitar Vivicam 4100, but its missing some features. The sticker on the camera says its only 2x zoom not 4x and there is no AC/DC charger (which was the main reason I chose this camera over others). Plus, the flash doesn't work. What a let down. I know the camera is inexpensive, but at least the camera should have the features that it states it has."
3,better definition for product,"a good selection fot the price,-see rating-- these cords are for simple household attachments not fot for heavy duty applications"
3,"A book that reveals a great deal, but leaves a lot of questions.","What do you call the part of the blade that rests on the backspring...that is the kick. Lots of good information on taking knives apart and putting them back together, but you will find yourself asking questions that aren't answered. On the flip side, there isn't anything better out there."
1,worthless,this item is actually worthless from a knife maker hobbyist point of view..I suggest that you do not buy this item.
3,PANZER OPERATIONS,General Raus was no doubt a great military tactician and anybody interested in war on the Russian front will be sure to find his memoirs full of technical details about the war in Russia sometimes omitted from a lot of books.Unfortunately if like myself you prefer something written in the first person that describes what was happening in gritty detail and describes the feeling of each situation. Your better off reading something like Guy Sajer's the forgotten soldier or Hanz Von Luck`s Panzer Commander.I found Panzer Operations although interesting to read like a text book and not a novel and although interesting on a technical point of view lacked in the personal feeling that you will find in other great world war 2 novels.
2,Frequent Amazon Purchaser,"This clock works okay, but it's much too complicated. It reuses the same buttons for several things. I threw it away and bought one at the drug store that was much easier to use and cost less."
1,<* should get 0 star,"I bought this last week. The clock keeps losing an hour between the time I go to bed and the time I wake up. You would think that the most important aspect of quality control for an alarm clock is to keep good time... If you have to be somewhere important in the morning and can't afford a one hour margin of error, get another alarm clock."
1,don't bother,"It did not set itself to any atomic clock in US or in Italy. It wouldn't keep time and it was hard to manually set it. It seemed like a great idea, but it was back to the cheap little manual alarm clock with the battery for my trip; I was glad I didn't throw the manual one out. I left the atomic travel clockack in italy rather than waste space on carrying it back."
2,Where's the display again?,"I loved the ""atomic"" aspect of this clock in addition to the travel amenities. But the first time I used it, I swear it was impossible to see the display once it was dark, even with the display ""lighted."" There was one exception to this--if I tilted the clock until it was almost closed. If it was at that angle, I could finally read the display. I'm surprised this little thing made it out of their testing facilities with this display problem. I have perfect vision and still couldn't see it for the life of me. Now, I'm in search of a different product once again. My advice is to not waste your time here, as nice as it sounds."
3,Can't see it at night...,"I am not happy with the Amazon description that stated that the clock ""has an auto-off backlight for clear viewing day or night."" I don't see how it could be clear viewing when you can't even see the clock at night, let alone the numbers, unless you find the clock and hit the top button to luminate it."
4,Great item,"The clock is compact and easy to read. It was just a bit confusing to set up; it didn't have the time zone for Alaska, where we were traveling. If you read the instruction booklet, it's easy to use."
5,THE KING OF FILTH,"DICE HATES EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE. HIS NO HOLES BARRED, CUTT THROAT, STANDUP COMEDY IS FOR ADULTS ONLY. IT CONTAINS BLOW YOUR MIND, XXX COMEDY. A MUST SEE FOR ANYONE WHO ENJOYS A COMEDIAN WHO USES FOUL LANGUAGE, AND SEXUALLY EXPLICIT STORIES"
4,Once upon a time,"The Diceman WAS once upon a time the most outragous comedian I have ever experienced. I watched this particular video once and could not laugh from the shock....then in the last few minutes of racist humour he gave his hand away and made us all aware that the ""Diceman"" is a characture for the modern day. It is in fact a persona that even Andrew could not keep! This is perhaps the greatest stand-up video of all time when you understand the cartoon! Too bad he could not expand or stay in character for the long run!"
1,Hard to use,I had no idea when I bought this pan that it was flaccid. What a dumb product. Unless you are a backpacker and want a pan you can roll up and carry in your pack. Very hard to use. It just collapses when you fill it. Yuck. The color is nice though.
4,Satisfactory,"Satisfactory. A comprehensive and practical kit, with the correct replacement parts for rebuilding the throttle plate. Sent and arrived promptly."
2,Lame,"Players should be very evenly matched in age/ability for this lame game, where you ask another player questions (from a printed card) and the answerer cannot say ""Yes"" or ""No,"" or repeat any answer. My kids and I played once. For a half hour. It has never left the closet again. I'd change my review to ""one star"" but this system won't let me."
3,It's okay for a couple of laughs,"I've had this game for a few years now. It gets played occasionally in my Sunday game group that meets monthly. It's a simple game, but avoiding saying yes or no or repeating an answer for ten questions is harder than you may think. It's one of those games the kids and Grandma can play as well. We found one ""trick card"" in the deck that says it's okay to say yes or no, only to discover it isn't. We took that card out of the deck.An okay game. My one gripe with it is that it comes with only 50 cards, so after playing this game a few times, you're going to start repeating. The game is out of print, so no new edition or expansion set is available. But it's harmless and good for a couple of chuckles."
2,Not what you think,"WARNING: These are not the original recordings. Although they are pretty good remakes, they are not originals. No where on this package does it mention this fact. It is a very deceitful thing to do. No notes. Go for ""I'm Little But I'm Loud."" Don't waste your money here."
5,Have book,I needed refills. I also purchased another book. Love the fact that it folds so you can see the directions without having too take the card out.
5,Increased Understanding of Mental Illness,"I read this book in one sitting--just couldn't put it down. The story is riveting and heart-wrenching. I learned a great deal about mental illness, and I feel that anyone who has a family member or friend dealing with it will benefit from reading this true account."
3,Russ Meyer does Belle De Jour,"Girl on a motorcycle is a 1960s time capsule piece about a forlorn wife who leaves her life behind to flee to her lover. The film is essentially a well-done exploitation film in that sets out to exploit Marriane Faithful and her motorcycle while punctuating the action and nudity with philosophical snippets of dialogue. Sort of like if Goddard directed ""Faster Pussycat, Kill, Kill"". However, the visuals are what's important in this film and they don't disapoint, especially if you are a fan of 60s films, such as ""The Trip"" or ""Psych-Out""."
2,"Fuzzy - ""artistic"" - European","I was lead to beLIEve that Maryanne Faithful showed some SKIN in this movie --- purchased it because of a favorable magazine review in ""MOTORCYCLE BAGGERS"" magazine --- After watching this MOVIE I am led to beLIEve that the reviewer NEVER watched the movie at ALL ... The biker scenes were of Ms. Faithful on a stationary BIKE - with a moving Special Effects SCREEN for her background to IMITATE motion or ""action"" --- terrible FX :-( Oh Yah! The PLOT was LAME too ;-("
3,Rated X? You've got to be kidding...,"This film has some good Harley riding by the girl in question, interesting scenery & cinematography and a nice, arty premise, but the psychedelics are annoying and by no means buy the DVD for the nudity. I can't believe this had to be ""extensively cut"" to get an R-rating. Seems to me that it would need a few seconds of trims at MOST and in fact there's nothing I saw here that I haven't seen in other R-rated movies. There isn't a lot of nudity in it and the vast majority is obscured by the psychedelic effects. The resulting footage is mostly no more explicit than a James Bond title sequence. The PG-rated Logan's Run shows off Jenny Agutter just about as much (without being so annoying). I can't help but wonder if this DVD doesn't really contain the cut version, although it doesn't look cut up... I've seen plenty of R-rated ""exploitation flicks"" that were way more revealing."
3,oh my,"I was home sick one day and happened upon this on TV, must have been a pay station. I really liked it. It was so weird, I loved that time. The 60's 70's. The acting was ok, but not great and the story line was thin, but I wanted to see it again. And added up buying it. I couldn't get it on Netflix."
4,good,"this mocie is ok but not like the other alain delon,s films iam not crazy about the script but is woth it to see them nude when they make love specialy the girl she so hot with no clothes on i would suggest this film for the husbands who are not taker of their waves or girl friend if you have the women in your life do not be boring you must be so much fun and great in sex other wise you will loose her watch the film you will know.picture quality is good."
1,"great looking, but does not work","The clock worked the first month, then it began to lose segments of each digit (display). Now, I can't return an item that has less than 60 days of use and is totally useless as a clock."
2,SONY,"Attractive looking clock radio worth only the $18+ that was its cost. Alarm instructions are difficult to follow and the control ""buttons"" not easy to move."
3,Love the BIG NUMBERS,"Very easy to see with near sighted eyes! A little more challenging to configure but once I figured it out, it worked well."
2,clock radio,I am not that happy with this clock radio and it has a whine on the station I listen to the most. The place I ordered it from was not that cooperative in helping me. Sony (the maker) will only take back product one bought from them so I have kept it.
3,Battery backup doesn't work well,After installing a new battery I lost power about a week later for just a short while (thirty seconds or so). When the power came back on this clock was about 15 minutes ahead. What good is a battery backup if you can't trust it?
4,Bedside Clock,Excellent bedside clock. Easy to read at night. Alarm is simple to set. Radio reception is poor without an ariel which I don't have..
2,Stopped working after 1 year,"I have had this clock for 1 year and it has stopped working. All the lights work, it tells the time and the radio works. You can set a wake-up time, but the alarm will not trigger in radio mode or buzzer mode. I believe the lower slider switch is bad. The switch became difficult to use a couple of months back and was always kind of a pain to use even when new. I liked the large display on this clock, but the alarm reset button was not easy to find. I thought of gluing something to the reset button to make it easier to find, but I never did. I have just ordered a new Seiko clock that is a much simpler design. The new one is cordless, no radio, no volume, and a simple switch to turn on the alarm. I was always accidentally changing the volume on this Sony, or tuning to a frequency that had no signal, or changing the dimmer. Anything can happen when you are trying to find that reset button! Those issues will not happen with the Seiko."
2,Pitiful radio and hard to use,"Great screen, but absolutely ludicrous radio selection and reception. Also, the controls for setting the alarm and time are a lot less than intuitive. Well, maybe when I finish my nuclear science degree..."
5,"Annoying, but effective.","This is the absolute most annoying alarm clock ever. The alarm buzz could wake the dead, and if you hit the radio button, it is just loud static. THIS IS THE BEST ALARM CLOCK EVER. I have a hard time getting up some times, this does the trick. If you are the same way in the morning, this'll get you out of bed and on the go!"
4,Still Going.,We bought this two years ago. Works great in every way. I suppose the only drawback may be the extra wire for the FM antenna. But I would buy again.
4,Almost Perfect,"I bought this so I could see the large numbers without my glasses on. It is very good for that. There are only two things that ought to be improved upon. First, there is no easy way to see what time the alarm is set for-- you have to slide a switch over one notch- and one notch only- to see this. This movement is hard with the lights on and almost impossible with the lights off. If you push the switch hard enough to move it, it wants to go more than one notch. This function should be done via a push button like on other alarm clocks. The other issue is similar-- you have to slide a different switch one notch only to activate the alarm mode. This would be OK if the switch had only two positions, but it has several, again making the one stop slide difficult. Other than these two small issues, this alarm clock radio if perfect."
2,Bad unit,The one we got is junk. Even with the brightness turned all the way up you can only just barely see the numbers for the time. I wonder if we got a used one that had been returned before.
5,Great Clock! Great Buy!,I bought this clock for my two boys so that they could wake themselves up in the morning. It was a great purchase. The alarm works fantastic and the numbers are large and they can see them across the room. I really like the clock and I am glad that I purchased it.
4,Very good clock radio,This clock radio has a very nice display that is bright and easy to read. The radio reception is excellent compared to other clocks of comparable price. My only complaints are that the snooze should be a little longer - 10 min would be better. Also the knobs on the right side of the unit to adjust the volume and tune the radio arenot in a convenient place and hard to find
2,Great Features but Clock is Inaccurate,"I ordered this item because I liked the way it looked and for all its features. When it arrived, I plugged it in, and then went out for lunch. When I came back, it was already ten minutes slow. I reset the clock, but it continued to lose about ten minutes every hour. It may simply have been this particular unit, but I was very disappointed. I am sending it back and hope to get a replacement with an accurate clock."
1,SONY CLOCK REVIEW,"I am not happy with this clock. I have sent the (2) clocks back once because it kept time 2 hours fast and I was not able to set the clock due to the keys not working in reverse. I just received the second round of (2) clocks from SONY and have the same problem. Per SONY they are sending me (2) new clocks again. I like the design of the SONY clock very much. I just wish the clocks worked correctly. If the THIRD round does not work I want my money refunded to my credit card. I had to pay for return shipping once, the third round is on SONY. I have never experienced this with SONY or any other company. I do hope the third round of clocks work. Stay tuned........"
2,Does not keep the correct time,"Although the large, adjustable-brightness display and adjustable volume is great to have, the functions are pointless since the clock does not keep the correct time. It's not bad, but every few days I have to reset the clock."
4,nice product,"So far, so good. The speakers sound better than my portable cd/radio player. It's a good looking alarm clock, although I overlooked the fact that the numbers are ""large display."" It has good features: changing the display brightness, high and low buzzer volume.Don't listen to anyone that says its confusing to use. You do have to be careful that you set the right alarm because their are two different ones you can set, but you don't have to be a genius to figure it out."
5,Solid Clock,"There is nothing here but clear numbers, a decent radio and an easy to use set of alarms. The design is simple, and it doesn't look ""junky"" on the nightstand like many other clock radios do. The only downside - the external antenna cord that seems to always float around behind the radio. Otherwise this is a good buy for under $20."
4,Very good alarm clock,I haven't had any problems what so ever with this clock. My only complaint is both alarms can't be set to buzzer; one has be to be radio.
2,Display not bright enough,Sony's green LED display is too dim for a sunlit room. I returned this clock and replaced it with theEmerson Radio CKS2235SB Jumbo Display Dual Alarm Clock Radio with SmartSet Technology. The Emerson has a red LED display which is visible from across the room any time of day.
1,poor quality,"Something about the construction of this clock causes vibrations which produces a faint buzzing or rattling sound. Pressing on the clock stops the sound until I release pressure. As far as I can tell, the sound is from the battery cover rattling, but something else internal is causing the vibrations. The rattle is not loud, but it keeps me up at times. Besides this, parts of the display seem to be going out and it doesn't keep good time.I am very disappointed. I can't seem to find a quality alarm clock with the basic features. I don't need/want a radio, or a self setting time (which typically gets time changes incorrect), or a CD player, or laser displays...I just need a simple plug in alarm clock with battery backup that doesn't buzz or die within a couple months...anyone listening?"
1,junk,"This would be a good versatile clock radio if it had an accurate clock. Amazon exchanged the first unit they sent me because the clock was 6 min fast in one month. The second unit they sent me was only 4 min fast after one month, but still totally unacceptable. Amazon does not want to exchange this second unit because it is over 30 days after purchase. Sony has a similar policy. The moral of the story: Do not buy a Sony and do not buy from Amazon unless you don't mind being stuck with a clock that you have to reset every couple of weeks."
1,Don't buy this one,"I don't usually write reviews, but I am doubly annoyed at this product because we bought two at the same time only to have them gradually fall apart. OK, it became part of our routine to set the clock back a few minutes everyday to compensate for it speeding ahead. But then it developed an annoying habit of issuing a short burst of the alarm at odd hours of the night. Both clocks are now in the trash.... what a waste of money."
1,Worst Sony product in the history,"Usually, I'm a big fan of Sony products but this time, if you are thinking to buy this, I suggest you to consider this first:Do you want a clock-radio which forwards itselft 10 minutes every day?Do you want a clock-radio with a big-almost-unreadable display?Do you want a bad designed interface ?Do you want a bad sounding radio ?Do you want see how some segments bright more than others so you can't read the time?Be my guest... buy this clock-radio."
2,Eh...,"I've been a long time Sony customer. I haven't written one bad review for their products until today. I bought a digital clock so you don't hear the ticking of an analog clock. This clock makes a very faint buzzing noise. When you press on the display the buzz stops. I'm not sure if it is an intermittent connection or a faulty component. Oh well, it only cost me $10. The search continues for a better one..."
2,Worked great for 4 months but now gains time,"I bought two of these for each of our nightstands and they worked great for 4 months. Suddenly they began to gain time. We're over the 30 day Amazon return policy now. We contacted Sony and they'll return it to see if they can repair it. Reading a few of these Amazon reviews I see a few people have had the gaining of time problem. Sony told us to unplug the units for 30 minutes and that would ""reboot"" them. Didn't work. We're disappointed to say the least and not sure if we'll return to Amazon or Sony at this point. Were it not for this problem I would've rated this a 5 for it's other features."
2,sliding button doesn't work very well,Everything works fine except for a top sliding bar that is used to switch from alarm set/clock set/time mode. Seems like it might break too soon. I'm back to using my cheap $5 clock I bought a couple years back.
2,Sony AM/FM Clock Radio.,"Good alarm clock. Bad radio (bad reception).In the age of the digital, regular radio seems bad antique."
3,"Em, problematic","This is a very good value at its price. It does its job very well. I've owned this for a week now. And it's off the Atomic clock by exactly 4 seconds(slow). It gives you a lot of options when it comes to alarm type and how loud the alarm is. Setting it is kinda strange at first but it's easy to get used to once you've had it for a couple days.Now for the complaint. The LED light is not bright enough for me. Even at its highest level(for those of you that think most LED lights are too bright, get this one, it gives you a lot of flexibility as far as how light it is. I just don't think it's bright enough). Also, the FM/AM tuning is kinda touchy and can get hard to adjust in bad areas.Sound isn't great but isn't bad for an alarm clock either.Overall, not a bad buy for 20 bucks.EDIT: Alarm clock has some kink that needs to be worked out, sometimes it doesn't ring!"
2,too complicate to use,"I was very disappointed with this alarm watch, it's really complicate to use and too big for your night stand table"
2,not so hot,"It was not near bright enough to see in the dark, or even in a lighted room. Sonja Mpls, Mn"
1,Very bad product from Sony,"I was really like the design of this clock, but there's a big issue with the time and LCD screen, sometime in the day the number on the display LCD will going crazy, that is when the time boost up and go fast, I have to adjust the clock every single day, finally it's now somewhere in the garbage recycle field. If only the rating system allow to have negative star.. I will give it full NEGATIVE"
3,Careful: Dual alarm not what you're used to,"I've had this alarm for all of about 20 minutes now and I already see something that concerns me. I'm a relatively light sleeper and I prefer to have very soft radio come on to see if it awakens me (this is what I do with my current Sony dual alarm clock).On this one, apparently you can't have the radio come on BEFORE the buzzer--if you want to use the buzzer as the last ditch effort to awaken you. If you try to have the radio come on before the buzzer, the manual clearly states that the buzzer will not activate. How...odd. I guess this behavior caters to folks who keep the radio on while they're getting ready. Which is great if someone else isn't still trying to sleep."
1,Unreliable piece of junk,"Sony used to stand for quality and innovation. I have bought a LOT of Sony products over the years. Back in the day it was the name you looked for. If you didn't buy Sony you settling for less.But no more.Here is an attractive and well featured clock radio that after using for a year and a half can no longer keep time. Yes, that's right. IT CAN'T KEEP TIME !!!! For goodness sake its the 21st century! People in my family have clock radios from the 80's and they still work fine!This one runs fast - it gains somewhere between 15-30 minutes per day. How is this possible? Working clocks were perfected decades ago!This is not the first Sony product to disappoint over the last few years. People, save yourself some aggravation. When you see the name Sony, run. RUN. They are using the absolute cheapest parts possible and cutting every corner possible, knowing that people will buy the product anyways because they see the 4 magic letters that used to mean quality."
5,Easiest to live with Clock radio alarm,Intiutive is the best description for this device. I used it in a hotel one time and knew that I had to have one! I have not been disappointed with the performance. Highly recommended for those that need to change the alarm time regularly and are your eyes are not as good as they once were.
4,AWESOME,"This clock works great. The buzzer for me and music for my wife. The best clock ever made for two people to wake at two different times. No more my wife saying ""Honey get up, Honey get up,"". I act like i don't hear it but i do. Nice looks to it too."
4,A little piece of home,The first time I heard Marcia Ball was in downtown Dallas at the Farmers Market eating breakfast with my husband. A gentleman was playing music for those eating on the outside court. The music was so great that after we finished eating we went up to him to find out who that artist was and needless to say it was Marcia Ball...we enjoyed it them and still enjoy it. I love to listen to it after a hard day at work...it sooths my soul and brings a back a little piece of home life.
4,"Great Quality, wrong product!!","I bought this Reggae bowl to match our other pieces, but when it was delivered in the Reggae package, it was the wrong patterned bowl! I liked it so we kept it as to not hassle with returning. Like the rest of my life, it doesn't necessarily match, but I love it!"
5,A Heroine's Journey,"Gaea Shaw's account of her heart disease, heart transplant and her new life is an inspiration to anyone whose life is spinning out of control. Gaea did all the right things: healthy diet, exercise--but her heart was giving out, and she was close to death. Her courageous descent into total surrender left me in tears. Shaw doesn't spare us any of the emotional turmoil she went through during this life-threatening experience, and yet this short book is written in a clear, simple, and unsentimental style. The way she told her story adds even more power to it. For myself, I know that if I were facing such a dire medical operation, at first I would be overwhelmed with fear and confusion. But Gaea's story elicited a deeper force within me (and all of us) which has the power to carry us through our darker hours, whether we are confronting day-to-day struggles or a life-and-death crisis."
3,Better than the first sock book,"This book is okay, better than the first sock book.What I don't like about this entire series is that the print is small, and the charts are in color, usually very dark colors, that are difficult to read even in good light under normal circumstances.Also, it would be nice if some of the patterns would tell you the multiple, so that you could use the pattern say for a hat brim or mitten cuff. And, it would be better if they had actual size photos of the yarns, so that the book will be more useful years from now.Finally, any book this new should have had directions for using two circulars instead of double-pointed needles."
2,Has anybody knitted a pattern from this book?,"I'm wondering if anybody even tested the patterns in this book before printing. How did they knit a 2 colored pattern, knitted in the round, without any specific instructions. Take the Rib and Panel socks (Red Hot chili Peppers), knitted in panels using 2 colors. I admit the pictures are pretty but the instructions are another thing."
2,Inadequate instructions mar an otherwise nice book,"There are some nice sock patterns in this book, but I agree with the other reviewers who have commented on the poor quality of the instructions. My specific complaint is about the pattern for the Domino Squared socks. It's an unusual pattern done with an interesting technique. However, the instructions are missing any guidance as to what the dimensions of the squares are supposed to be, which makes it very difficult to figure out if you're on track or to troubleshoot. I'm a seasoned enough sock knitter that I have some idea of how things should fit. I don't mind a challenge, but I'd rather have the challenge come from the technical aspects of the knitting than from figuring out the directions. Frankly, I expect more from Vogue Knitting. If you're looking for a good book of sock patterns, this is not it."
5,Great sock patterns!,"I love love love this book. I first borrowed it from the library, and realized that I HAD to own it! I've knitted my son several pairs of socks using the patterns from this book. Great instructions and fantastic pictures."
5,Home Maintenance for Dummies,"WOW! Who knew all the maintenance a house needs? The cleaning solution recipes are great, safe, and really do the best job. I have been slowly implementing a home maintenance program based solely on this book. It is easy to read and understand. Whether you are a novice or expert in taking care of your home and its appliances, you will learn alot from this book. It is not just about proper cleaning. It is about keeping your house and appliances looking their best and in working order for as long as possible. I give this book as a housewarming gift to all my friends who own a home."
3,I think I must be too dumb.,"The authors assume way too much reader knowledge for this to be a true guide for dummies. Also, the For Dummies format does not allow for much illustration. So a lot of what they describe goes way over my head. It does help me understand what I need to say when I call a pro. That's actually a big help for one as home-maintenance-challenged as I. Don Aslett's excellent books are more my speed, though he does tend to write the same book over and over again."
3,Good not great,As a new homeowner I bought the Home Maintenance for Dummies to help answer a few questions I had about home ownership. The book certainly does have a lot of information in it. It provided the answers to my questions and much more. I found the book to be good but I was a little overwhelmed with all of the information.
3,Good but not great,"My husband and I got this book when we bought our first house. We thought it would give detailed instructions on how to do things around the house. It has some good information, but it's not very detailed. Someone gave us a copy of Home Depot's Home Improvement 1-2-3, and it's much more of what we were looking for."
5,Great charger,"I got this charger for my Sanyo SCP4900. Electrical chargers are of no use when you're on a roadtrip, so a car charger became an necessity. It charges the phone very quickly, even more quickly than the normal charger for the phone. It shuts off when the phone is completely charged, so you don't have to worry about it frying the battery. The indicator light is helpful as well. My only complaint is the bungee cord is a bit short, but it's long enough to keep it in my cup holder, car organizer thing. So, not a major complaint. Overall, it's exactly as I expected."
1,"Speaking, not Saying","I couldn't believe this book was reprinted by Tarcher.It does capture perfectly the vacuity that has existed asthe Gurdjieffian ""teaching."" I felt awfully sorry for thosepoor souls who earnestly try to understand the responses of thegroup leader (Pentland)in these sessions.Sometimes people are very good at saying nothing because theydon't actually know anything. Overall, a very sad reminder of""the blind leading the blind."""
5,great little book,this book is perfect for one-minute admission orders for many of the common medical cases. this is a book you want to carry around in your coat pockets as you respond to those pesky calls from the ER about a new admission.Note that it does not explain any of the conditions; it only lists the most appropriate orders you may want to write for the common conditions.Overall a great little book.
4,For dry or color damaged hair,"When you have had a really bad perm experience, you get a bit desperate and start trying every product in sight. Everything that says ""hot oil"" sounds good to you and yet, I decided to try a intensive treatment instead.What I have to say is, this product did not work as well as the John Frieda Frizz-Ease Smooth Start Defrizzing Shampoo and Glistening Crème Frizzing Conditioner for long term care.I found that the Total Hair Recovery product was best mixed with some olive oil or a hot oil treatment. This comes with a treatment cap so you can use this product in the shower and keep your hair out of your eyes. It is good for a once a month hair treat.Best for ""just dry"" hair or ""just color treated"" hair, but not as highly recommended for really-damaged-from-the-worst-perm-ever-hair. For that, go get the Frizz-Ease products!~The Rebecca Review"
4,BACK IN 1974,"Back in 1974, there was a new German band making its way to the top, playing the kind of rock they believed in, with a great singer (Meine), a great songwriter (R. Schenker) and a virtuoso guitar player (Roth). THis FLY TO THE RAINBOW captures the marvellous quality of the band at the time. The tittle track is epic, fantastic. THe other tunes are diverse, sometimes simples, sometimes very creative, but always good. I must remember you tha, sadly, Roth left the band in 1979, and SCORPIONS went, with Mathhias Jabs, to pursue the ""AMERICAN DREAM..."", be it: playing pop metal with silly love / sex lyrics... Sad..."
5,Awesome book,"Bought this book when trying to learn how to play 42, it provided very good insight into how to play the game and how to win. With this book and the PC game Win42 I have become quite proficient at 42."
4,Excellent recipes,"This is a very good book for rotisseries. It does seem to favor the Ronco rotisserie, but the directions are very easy and versatile so they can be used in most all rotisseries. Almost everything I've cooked from this book was fantastic, although the kids don't seem to like the spicy recipes as much as I do. The one improvement that I would like to see is have this book in a digital recipe program. I would buy this again if it were converted for a recipe program that I could import rather than have to type it all in to my program by hand."
3,It's okay,"I looked it over but I haven't used it yet ,some recipes look good, I'll have to give them a try."
1,No photos no pictures,"She mentions pictures in the book , but not one picture. Cookbooks need pictures. It is mostly an advertising book and not designed for outdoor rotisseries. Over priced, under delivers. Very basic recipes anyone already knows. Very thick though."
1,Don't like Kindle version,I love my iPad and I love using epicurious app. So I decided to buy kindle version. Big mistake. Hard to navigate and no pictures. I will not buy any kindle version cookbook.
3,Good but no temperatures,The recipes in this book are really great (!) BUT....I have a Cuisinart countertop rotisserie that allows me to choose the temperature (250 - 450). This book tells you how long to cook things but not at what temperature. Weird. I guess some rotisseries must be one size fits all as far as temperature is concerned......?
2,Misleading Title,"I selected this book because the title sounded like it was for any type of rotisserie. It turned out to be really favoring the Ronco rotisserie - not the kind I have. I was looking for timing of the food besides recipes, and it isn't easy to convert for my rotisserie."
5,who knew?,who knew there was so many things to do in your rotisserie?? very user friendly cookbook. tons of recipes. love it.
5,Good results with Ultimate Rotisserie Cookbook,"I ordered the rotisserie cookbook because I had just bought a big natural gas grill with a rotisserie built in. Without knowing anything about a rotisserie, I did a chicken that turned out great. My wife and I decided that the rotisserie would prepare a lot of different meats and vegetables, but we did not know how to go about it. I found the Ultimate Rotisserie Cookbook and ordered it immediately. It came right away and we read most of it in just a day or two. Since receiving it, it we have tried several recipes with great success. There are still recipes we will be trying, but so far, we are really happy with the cookbook."
5,10 STAR rub A TRUE STEAK HOUSE RUB,"Well we're sold for life all the other beef rub are going to others, this is the best ever and on steaks, tri tip, ""london broil"" all of them the best amazing from a neighbor also. We live about 70 miles outside of Vegas and the items comes from Vegas ! ! What a small world"
3,No Temperature Settings,"This book seems aimed at Ronco and George Forman horizontal rotisserie ovens and not for vertical ovens such as the Cuisinart. It does not give suggested temperature settings, only internal temperatures to be taken with instant read thermometers. Perhaps the Ronco and Forman ovens do not have a variety of temperature settings like the Cuisinart. Interesting marinades, but I wanted cooking instructions."
4,Great book!,I have been having fun with this book. The recipes are great! I still prefer to have a cookbook in front of me rather than a laptop in the kitchen. I also like to take the book with me so I can make meal plans when an opportune moment presents itself.
4,READ HERE if your purchasing this item,"Dean, Dean, Dean... As far as the guitar, it is definitely worth it for the price, BUT keep this in mind: You might have to replace this product a couple of times (at least for me, I am returning the second one in one week, today). The first one, pretty much all the packaging was very poor, and I blamed it on Amazon. I got the second one yesterday, and the box used by Amazon was of good quality, and was not damaged nor bent as the first one was, I have to say though, that it was ripped from one side, but probably someone pulled it and ripped it. The problem with the second one, I think it is the packaging Dean uses is not the best for shipping such delicate product, you would expect more protection for an item like this.In conclusion, the guitar is perfect and it sounds great, but I have encountered issues with getting one that has no damages. I'm getting a third one, and I'll update on the packaging once I receive it."
3,Good starting bass,This bass as others have said is unplayable when u receive it. The buzzing is terrible. But knowing that I took it to a shop and they calibrated it for me. There is still buzzing but now it is playable. It is not any where near being a pro or semi pro instrument. It is strictly for beginners or for something where you would not want to take a real bass. It is what I would call a throw away instrument. I use it to practice when I don't want to plug my instrument in or for going to jam at the beach or something like that. I would never take it to the recording studio or to a gig where I will be getting payed. It is not a bad instrument for a student and the price is good. You have to expect that it will be unplayable when you get it and it will need to have work done on it but a good store will probably not charge you more than $50 to get it playable. It sure does look good though!
4,"Great guitar, I think","This looks like and feels like a solid guitar, the issue is upon initial tuning two of the strings busted. Thankfully Amazon customer service is exceptional. I can't wait to try the guitar beyond tuning."
3,You get what you pay for.,"When I first got my Dean I was pretty happy with it, but after a few weeks the top string started to not fret properly, i.e. it would sound about two frets higher than I was intending. It took me a few weeks to realize that the neck was warping. I got into the truss rod and adjusted it to the point where the frets acted the way they should but now the action is quite high and it doesn't play nearly as easily. Other than this, I have been pleased."
4,Hot Stuff,Memorable vintage rock. Early Prog rock similar to Yes and other super bands of the era. Brings back memories of where I was and what I was doing back then.
5,demons and wizards,What can I say it's Uriah Heep! I believe this is one of thier better works. I loved listening to it again. It brought back many memories.
4,The Men who Wear the Stars,"Being from Texas, I was delighted to read a book about Texas History. The detail of the book was great, and the story was facinating. Buy it! You will not regret it!"
4,Lots of fun to read.,"I agree with all of the other positives that have been written about this book. Not only does the book provide a complete history of the Rangers, it does so with spurs jingling and guns loose in the holster. I read all of Louis Lamour's books and found this as fun to read as all but Lamour's best."
5,The Best Movie Ever,"I have been into Ghostbusters (both the movies and the cartoons) ever since I was two years old. I am now 14 and still love it. I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of Ghostbusters 3, due out anytime now."
2,Good for grown-ups..,"This cartoons are good for adults who want to remember oldies cartoons..but for my kids, they got bored.."
5,Excellent Whisk,"If you're looking for a quality whisk, then this is it! The size is perfect for everyday use. It is very well made with 18/10 Stainless steal constrution. The silicone handle provides a good non-slip grip. I use it to whisk eggs and to mix baking batter with ease. It is very easy to clean and I like that it is dishwasher safe. My experience using it has been very good so far and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
2,horrible paint,"i had read reviews for the vendetta, about how the finish was not transparent, but brown, and didn't think the evo was like that. I got my evo in today, and the thing is dark rough brown paint. not the pretty natural that was in the picture at the time. the guitar had been shipped in one box with no padding, just the dean box. there was a pretty good dent at the base of the body where some paint had come off. my fingernail took off more chips. My pick took off a big swipe. I'm pretty sure i could strip all of the crappy paint job off the guitar with my guitar pick in about 10-15 minutes, and re finish it with something else. The sound from the guitar is way muddier than all my other guitars. The neck isn't thin, it's fat. The neck is also warped. There's a big dip on the EAD side, while it's flat on the GBE side. I can't get the strings very low. If I had spent $100 on this, it would go back right away, but as it is, I'll just sort of feel ripped off at about $60."
3,Great for a beginner,"The Dean Evo is a pretty standard guitar. The bolt on neck goes out of tune very easily, so be kinda careful. I definitely would not want to gig with this guitar, but for messing around at home, its a great deal. I paired it with my Crate 212r and it sounded surprisingly good. Very rich distortion, and pretty good cleans. The action is very low so it's great for beginners and you can adjust it with the allen wrenches it come with. Overall, its a decent beginner's guitar."
1,P.O.S.,"The Dean Evo doesnt look like the picture, it is dark purple and when I pulled it out of the box it had a one inch chip off of the finish on the front exposing the basswood body. It was so well wrapped that it couldnt have happened in shipping. I wish someone had looked at it before they sent it. This really sucks because its a christmas present and only 5 days till then. Piece of junk. This product gets zero stars."
5,All around nice guitar,"Can't beat this one for the price. Fanatastic looks! Loved the wood texture and color. Even the neck and headstock look good. Very basic electronics. This was fine for me as it is a backup guitar. Pretty flat sound from the factory. Put a set of Slinky strings on it and , WOW!!! It was like I was holding a completely different guitar. With the Slinky strings and a Boss Metal Zone pedal, I was able to dial in the extra-thick distortion heard on Siverchair's song, Tomorrow, from the Frogstomp album. There is no better deal on a brand new guitar! Excellent for beginners or as a back-up for a gigging musician. Good strings and the right set-up make this sound like a guitar in the next price range."
2,Fair,"I played it for literally 15 minutes and 2 strings already broke. It also didn't keep a tune which is a major problem, but while I got to play it at the beginning it sounded very smooth for a cheap guitar."
2,not as described,"I have purchased 3 of these guitars at different times. The first 2 were great, good guitars and very nice looking. I ordered the third for my grandson for his 11th birthday. When it arrived we looked at it before we gave it to him and it was not mahogany finished as described and pictured, but looked like it was made from cheap walnut cabinet material. It may have been great sounding but we couldn't get past the very ugly finish and we sent it back."
1,Has a lot of problems,This guitar has a lot of problems. First it wouldn't stay in tune then we found that the tuning knobs had tightening screws. This helped some but then when I played different chords one or two strings would be out of tune but the open string sounded fine. The adjustments on the bridge were not adjusted properly. I am very unhappy with this guitar and would like another one but I don't want to go without a guitar as I need one to play for this band that I am a member of. I know it is more than 30 days since I got this guitar but the guys I play with have been trying to get it adjusted and basically I have a $100 piece of crap guitar.
3,Not a Bad Starter,"It's playable, although I did like the Vendetta more (got both for gifts for others).The finish is fairly random on these I think...the vendetta I ordered came through brown as the picture. This one came through close to black, really dark finish.This one was tougher to setup than the Vendetta was, and it did not hold intonation as well. If I had one, I'd probably trade it off earlier than I would the Vendetta. For the price and quality, I'd go with the other though.You can't get as high on the neck with this one. The strings don't come through the body, so sustain is not as great. It's a little non-descript in appearance.Still not a bad guitar, but I'd recommend the Vendetta first (and did in my review there)."
2,Starts good but ends up being a rant,"I read Riverbend's blog entries as she was posting them and the impressions I have are probably different from those who read everything all at once. Like many of the Iraqi bloggers the best part is the honesty that comes across in her writing. Her descriptions of the killings, bombings and other hardships endured by the previously privileged residents of Baghdad were griping.Unfortunately as time passes Riverbend becomes overly cynical and starts sounding like a western journalist covering the story. When she decided, along with most Sunni, not to vote in January 30th, 2005 election, it becomes clear political ranting is all that's left of the once semi-objective ""Girl Blog from Iraq.""For a balanced view of the situation in Iraq, including blogs like IraqTheModel and HealingIraq is a must."
1,It doesn't have the ring of truth to it.,"I picked this book up from the ""new"" bookshelf at the library, expecting to have a great read about the war from the viewpoint of an Iraqi woman, but the more I read it, the more I became convinced that it is a total fabrication, that no woman in Iraq had anything to do with the writing of this book. It totally lacked the ""ring of truth"" to it. The writing was very American and seemed out of touch with Iraqi or Islamic culture and way of thinking. I have had Iraqi friends since college, and their viewpoint and way of expressing themselves is distinctive, unique to their culture and gepgraphy. But Baghdad Burning seemed totally North American in comparison to the Iraqi way I have come to know and love. It also doesn't seem like a very convincing female viewpoint. There is a glaring lack of authentic femaleness about it. I smell another ""Diary of Hitler"" and I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out an American wrote this book."
5,very informative,"Being a new home buyer, I found this extremely useful - especially while going through a re-financing. But as the book says it's for dummies [like me :)], and covers only the basics.very well written."
2,Roll this into Home Buying for Dummies,"I have never bought a house, but I considered myself investment and money savy. This book should be rolled into the homebuying for dummies, there just wasn't enough valuable information in it to make it worth the money.Don't buy this book if you already no the differance between Fix and Adjustable, understand how points typiclaly lower interest costs, understand that banks and lenders want to compete for your business (so hunt for the best loan).Buy this book if you are looking for a read ahead before buying a mortgage, or want to get a standard understanding of how the system works. This will not help your credit problems or getting a better loan with possible the exception of fees and lender pratices."
2,meh... there's better reads out there,"I work in the mortgage business, and bought this because I thought it'd be a cheap way to see what ""professionals"" were recommending future borrowers. MEH... not really worth it, very opinionated and doesn't provide the real terminology and background that other books on the market provide. It speaks to the reader like they are a real dummy... not someone who just doesn't know the mortgage world."
3,COOL!,"Although most of the book was fairly easy to read for an individual not in the mortgage business, there were still moments that I had to 're-read multiple pages and phrases and was still confused with certain pointers."
4,Great buy,This title really walked you through the Morgage cycle form application to closing all the way though refinance. Also the author explains the home buying process from purchasing your first to buying and selling homes. It really helped!
4,Good Introductory Book for Those Unfamiliar with Mortgages,"I didn't know a lot about mortgages before I read this book. I picked it up to learn more about any and all types of mortgages, and I wasn't disappointed. This title covers all necessary terminology, even the most basic (which is great for beginners like me).The chapters are broken into logical sequence, and the autors do a very good job of directing you to relevant related chapters (e.g. telling you to skip ahead to a later chapter if you are not thinking about certain types of mortgages).I cannot comment on whether this book would be too basic for those familiar with the industry, but it certainly is an appropriate introduction for mortgage ""dummies"" like me."
1,Shriveled Mess!,"SIXTY SEVEN DOLLARS for a box of badges. After a couple years these cheap plastic badges were so shriveled and lumpy that they were an embarrassment to hand out to our guests! Even with the card placed in, they would not uncurl! They looked like I stored them in water! I was so disgusted I wrote to Avery and they ignored my concerns. I guess I'd have to pay hundreds to expect quality. Obsurd! If you buy them, use them up right away, or better yet, stay away from them! It's a huge rip off!"
5,the best italian cooking magazine,"this is the best cooking magazine ever!! The recipes are easy and delicious.The subscription is expensive, but worth every penny!"
2,Not quite what I expected,"I was looking for informative and folkloric style but this description fit only a small few first pages of the book. A big part of the book is dedicated for the ""open your heart and see the magical world around you"" kind of faeries. Example would be the fairy of pure joy or the slippery fairy that make it ""slippery"". The bad fairy section of the book is heavily centered around this theme. Rather than dedicated to trolls, ogres, and goblins, it is full of personifications of negative things possibly invented by the author himself and I don't like that.Overall, it's a bad book if you are like me, seeking for information and nothing else and it would be a good book if you are the kind of person who is romantic or like to tune with nature and see things within."
3,Not as good as the first book.,"I purchased the original Faeries book during the first printing. I really enjoyed it so I purchased this book to finish off the ""collection"". I liked the first book better. The art work in the Good Faeries, Bad Faeries, is very similar to what is in the first book. Some of it is so close that I had to pull out the original book to see the differences. If you're looking for a creative new book by Brian Froud, this isn't it. It's a poor imitation of the original Faeries, nothing new or creative here."
5,adorable..,"I met Froud's faeries 3 years ago, and since I met them, they are my new realty.. I'm so happy to be able to touch them, to read about them.. Thanks to Froud.."
1,Froud's work is terrific but book's quality is terrible...,"I'm a long-time collector of Froud and a WOF member. This book was purchased by my husband from my Wish List. I was delighted to receive it but was very disappointed in the quality of the edition. A complete set of 24-pages was missing and replaced with a duplicate set. Amazon's Customer Service (always great to work with) sent a replacement immediately but that book was also a a printing disaster. All the graphics had inappropriate color bled into the images (excessive blue, yellow, red). Definitely not acceptable in a book purchased not only for it's amusing text, but particularly for it's artwork. I returned it also as Amazon could not guarantee me an edition without the printing errors. As usual, they issued a total refund (thanks amazon)."
5,Dark and Beautiful,This book is amazing! From the writings to the art to the surprise that flipped over it becomes the dark side of the book! I cherish this one!
5,Fairies!,"This is another great book by Brian Froud. Beautifully illustrated, as I've come to expect. I like the way that the good fairies are on the front of the book, and the bad fairies start the same way, but on the opposite end / side. Very interesting idea."
5,"""Good Faery's / Bad Faery's"" A MUST HAVE","This book is a great book. Its a must have for anyone and everyone. It tells you everything about faerys and everything you'll ever want to know. It has great pictures and there 2 words to describe it ""must have"""
4,Bob Marley re-born,"I was vacationing on the island of St. Lucia when Kymani's video for Warriors came on, it was like hearing Bob Marley alive and well, I try to follow the music of Bob Marley's children and I've enjoyed some but no voice had captivated me as much as his son Kymani. When the next video was another of Kymani's songs called Country Journey, I immediately started my hunt for this CD, calling everyone I knew to track where I could get it. His voice is as seductive and passionate as his father's, his lyrics drive down into your soul and lifts you up. I've been playing his songs as much as I can to let his name be known."
4,Spritual singer and song writer,"After listening to his cd i really have to say this is rather refreshing indeed, his lyrics are well put together in other words substance i would say and not alot of artist can produce a song with good lyrics. I really admirer the way he puts alot of emotions into his songs example (Dear Dad).I would really like to see him out there more because no one really knows about him and it's only by word of mouth that you my here about him.I hope he keep on being that talented artist he is and we'll keep on being the sincere fans we are."
5,Bob's sole heir to his throne.,Bob Marley has resurface in the music of his son Kymani. He has taken hold of his legacy and has put a new and refreshing twist on it. A true superstar in the making.
2,wasn't impressed,"Ordered a tin of tea bags to put into a gift basket with other tinned products and was sent two boxes of tea bags as a replacement for the tin, as they were out of stock. I am not impressed that they didn't contact me to see if I would accept a replacement product. I had to go through the 'return nonsense process' and to add insult to injury, I had to pay the return shipping for their inconsiderate mistake. Send me what I ordered, or don't send me anything without checking with me first - makes sense to me. Don't assume that you can make that decision for me! Just takes a phone call !!!!!!!!!"
4,Great Monitor but...,This is a really great monitor at an excellent price but be advised it does not have USB ports to plug in a keyboard and mouse.
4,"Equipment is fine, Great Picture.","The Grid Program does not work with an HP Media Center PC, and the TV picture is very poor in when using the full screen. However, if you reduce the size significantly, it becomes clearer.For regular PC activity it is very sharp and clear."
4,Very durable monitor with some limitations,"I have used Acer monitors for as long as I can remember. I'll list some pros and cons.pros -Good priceNo issues with it (eg. dead pixels)Easy to use, and very compatible with all devices.Cons -Only con is the resolution tops out at 1680x1050 which is somewhat outdated. If your gaming you want 1920x1080.This is still a very strong monitor which can be left on and used for years. I am up to 5 years of constant use as a dual monitor with no issues."
1,I liked it OK til it died,"We were very excited to get his to replace our old 19"" VGA monitor. Over time, though, it became clear that the response time was on the slow side for gaming, and the color was a bit off for video watching. Then the backlight died after 8 months of regular use. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Exceptional Quality for the price,"Received the monitor well packed and flawless without a single dead pixel. This monitor is an exceptional value for the money. I have a Dell high-end wide screen monitor, and frankly the Acer blows it away for about a 30% lower price. Text is clearer and easier to read than the Dell, and brighter. Graphics and multimedia are superb. 3D graphics are more than adequate, though I think that for the ultimate 3D experience, you may want a much more expensive monitor.I did not especially care for the Acer monitor stand, but took the advice of another earlier reviewer and ordered an Ergotron Neo-Flex adjustable monitor stand (Staples online had the cheapest price), and am VERY happy with it. (Adjustable in oh so many ways!)Overall, I haven't seen a better 22"" monitor at any price! I am buying a second one for computer #2 to replace the Dell, which will end up on my guest room system.HIGHLY recommended."
4,Decline and Fall,"the book was delivered in the proper time and went against my expectations. the only problem I observed was that to come slightly damaged -the transport, I sppose - Not a big problem!"
3,Does this Book Belong in the Humor Section?,"This review is more a review of a review than a review of the book which is accurate in predicting the future but enchanted with vacous methodlogies and associated retooling. (The IT graveyard is littered with these wonderful ""new"" methodolgies. Speaking of which, when did methodolgy enter our lexicon. Ugh!)I do not personally know the reviewer, Sam from NC, USA but I know he is arrogant and in for a breataking fall. My guess is he is very young. His type, and the industry is rife with them, is a major problem. I know, he is superman and the rest of us our just naysayers but please clean up your own messes."
3,"A useful book, but take with a pinch of salt","Firstly, this is a pretty good read as computer books go. It contains a lot of good information in an easily digestible fashion.It's a good book to learn about a range of contemporary (ish) issues in IT - software processes, CASE tools, QA, metrics reuse etc etc. Short chapters and Yourdon's chatty style help greatly. The chapter on recommended reading has some great pointers too.The negatives are that it's pretty superficial at times and reads very much like a consultant / salesman selling his wares rather than someone who actually runs projects for a living. In particular, the chapter on software methodologies seemed very simplistic to me (and I have had experience of many, believe me!)Still, all in all I'd recommend this to any IT profesional who feels he/she is only exposed to a narrow range of software tools & methods and wants to know more about what else is out there."
2,Ed got it wrong,"This book had a profound influence on me when I read it. The same can be said for the organization I worked for at the time and organizations all over the US. We all started working on building the highly specific software development processes that would turn our companies into the super efficient software factories Ed described. IT WAS A HUGE WASTE OF TIME! Out of these experiences, the agile software development methodology was born. It turns out that ""American Cowboy Programmer"" can compete with anyone in the world when allowed to write software that meets the customer's needs. The primary lesson learned, a working software solution if far more valuable than 10,000 pages of documentation describing the solution."
5,Fabulous simple dollhouse,"This is a fabulous first dollhouse. It is easy to assemble, comes with everything, all wooden and very simple. My daughter loves it and it is now the ""go to"" toy when all her friends come over. Love it!!"
2,did not like it,the toys where easy to break i was not to happy with anything about this purchase and i will not shop here again for this particular item
5,Great value,"We got this house for our youngest daughter on her 3rd bday! Love at first sight. She plans and developes her game. Keeps her engage. Allows mobility. The child doesn't have to be sitting for extended periods.It's a classic toy, ready to be played with (without additional buying)...great value!"
5,Titans of Yoga,"What an amazing film. We have watched this several times. Bought it originally when it first came out and loved it. Unfortunately the DVD was destroyed, but this was worth purchasing again to own. I keep showing it to all my friends, everyone loves the interviews."
4,Interesting,"Enjoyed watching the different interviews but didn't like how it kept jumping from one to another. I would have preferred someone asking each the same question and then showing each of the responses and going to the next question or an actual interview with one person and then moving to the next. Overall, pretty good."
3,pretty infomative,There are many good Yogi in this DVD I like. I like how they share their own experience and insight. I just going to donate it to the library for others to watch. Because it is not some thing I need to watch again and again.
1,NOT the Coasters.,"Listen to the clips. They are not the originals. ""Hollywood Records"" did the same thing to The Drifters. Don't buy."
2,Good when it works.,"The graphics are excellent in the first-person shooter, but the game is filled with bugs (bombing out of the game back to the desktop when trying to save and continue; inexplicable color shifts; freezing up entirely at times which requires a reboot of the computer.)"
1,amateur game developers,"This game had a very promising look to it, but alas when played, was pathetic. Every opponent in the game moves 2-3 times faster than your character so it is IMPOSSIBLE to employ any strategy or worse, escape anything. Additionally, most of the rooms with encounters had the monsters continually respawning. My impression was this game was developed by an 15 year old who loves to button mash. Loved the concept of ""I wanna Rock"" by Twisted Sister playing and the Greek mythos monsters."
3,Serious Sam Meets Zeus..,"This is a fairly decent FPS, that is alot like Serious Sam: One man against a horde of monsters. Flying monsters, hopping monsters and running monsters; all in a Greek mythology inspired environment.The weapons are OK and the graphics are good but the controls are a little sticky at times."
1,Will fail,"This game is a total copycat of the classic Serious Sam, just with updated 3D visuals and audio with different characters in roman instead of egypt. That's all. Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money: And NOT worth the purchase!!!"
3,20 Musicals,"The provider did an excellent job at getting the product to me in a timely manner, and in excellent condition. I just feel the quality of the video could have been better. The sound was muted and muffled, and the visual quality made it seem as if the original had not been improved from its decades of deterioration."
2,musicals dvd,"Most of the movies are not well known. The cover gives the impression that Fred Astaire will be in many of the movies; he's not and to see cast names you must actually start the dvd, there isn't a written movie guide. I'm sure a few of the movies will be good but so far no luck."
4,Pretty Cool Set,"I wasn't expecting to get a top notch selection of musicals. Many are a little on the dull side, a few are even confusing, but there are some real gems in this collection. At less than $1 a piece, I'd say, if you enjoy old movies and have the patience to sort the good from the bad, you'll find hours of enjoyment in the set. Pay particular attention to Jane Powell's film ""Delightfully Dangerous"". It is just great!"
2,Disappointed,"For someone who adores musicals and most of the actors of that era, this set was a disappointment and really not worth it...although the purchase price is minimal. The musicals are badly reproduced, black and white, and old--I mean reeeeeally old! It is not worth the money."
3,musicals,I was disappointed in the quality of the movies. The are grainy and some had skipsor pauses in them. Wouldn't buy as old of a year of movie again.
3,Just a comment..,A review first and foremost should be about the content ie in this example the films within this 20 pack....not the vendor packaging....delivery.If you then wish to compliment or note your displeasure re the handling of the product by the vendor..find and good.
5,Very good in their refund policy,I never received the labels ordered and they were very quick to issue me a full refund against the item including shipping.
3,Muddied sound quality on some tracks,"I'm a longtime Jennifer Warnes fan, and I love ""Shot Through the Heart,"" but don't ignore some of the other reviewers' comments about flawed sound on certain tracks. That's not to say you shouldn't get the CD, but fans of the original LP will notice inferior sound on several tracks. It's too bad BMG couldn't have done a better job."
2,Album review,Classic album of songs from a great singer.Stylish arrangements for an album this old show the quality of the production
1,Failed after 3 months of use,"The clock, radio, and light functions spontaneously ceased working 3 months after I started using this clock radio; as far as I know, nothing happened to the clock radio to cause it to break.When it still worked, it was confusing to program, and required one to reprogram all stations, clock, and alarm times any time the clock was unplugged or the power went out, as there is no battery back-up. The light alarm is a bit annoying, as it flashes on and off, rather than coming on steadily. By itself, the light is too dim to use to read.Amazon will not take defective product returns after 30 days, so if you purchase a clock radio that breaks after a month, you will have to ship it at your own expense to Sony, and they'll replace it with the same lousy clock radio (""refurbished"")."
1,A waste of carbon,"All im going to say is look at the sort of people who like this 'gore-grind' cr*p and rated this 5 stars. They can barely string two words together, or even spell for that matter..."
1,I Hate Death Metal,This CD is just plain awful.There is not one song where you can understand a single word that the lead singer says.What bothers me even more is that people actually like this kind of stuff and hate music that is actually good.
4,Very sturdy,"This stand is very heavy, of very good quality. But what I dont like is that it can not set the hight of to Rototom lower then 96cm. Sometimes I would prefer to play it sitting from a standard chair as if it would be a snare drum in front of me between my legs, but thats not possible. As an alternative I set the rototom at an 90 angle and play it like I use to with a Gong."
4,Lots of great ideas,"I found this book to be well worth the cover price: it is full of rich photos and inspiring ideas. I don't purchase decorating books for the text, so if you do, this may not be the book for you. There are several different styles depicted within the book, certainly there is something for everyone. I do also recommend the Better Homes and Gardens ""Garden Style"" book: it has a similar feeling and again, many great ideas."
2,Too cutesy,Garden style is my style. I love it. But this book is too cutesy and the photos show some rooms that just don't look real. I don't know if they were done in a studio or what. The best book on the subject (at least it's the one I keep going back to because I always find fresh ideas in it) is Garden Style by the Better Homes and Gardens editors. I've given that BHG Garden Style book to friends as birthday and housewarming gifts too.
1,Blue Skies CD,"Wanted this song for a Memorial Service. When I played the cd, it sounded like Willie was talking the song out instead of singing it. I was very dissappointed."
1,Another Misinterpretation of Masonry,"I am a Christian who holds to the five fundamentals of the faith. I am grieved and disappointed that this kind of misinterpretation is taking place among Bible-believing Christians. After reading a few titles along this same line, I see a correlation between believers who insist upon taking everything literally and anti-Masonic rhetoric. Freemasonry is full of allegories and symbolism, a point this author refuses to acknowledge. There is also an absence here of acknowledging that Freemasonry operates on general, not special, revelation.If you're looking for a good, sound critique of Freemasonry, this one isn't it. Freemasonry isn't perfect by any means, but it also isn't occultic. I recommend ""Born in Blood"" by Robinson or ""The Meaning of Masonry"" by Wilmhurst as much more reputable titles."
1,Pile of Supreme Crap,"Nothing but a bunch of drivel from the religious right. This guy seems to have serious problems with a group that has done so much for our society,country and our freedoms."
3,Harris exposes the occultic roots of Freemasonry,This booklet is an informative look into the pagan roots and occultic rituals practiced in Freemasonry. The Christian Mason will be challenged to research Masonic literature and practices to determine if Freemasonry is incompatable with Christianity.
4,Not a bad expose',"Not a bad expose' on the occultic and un-biblical inner workings of freemasonry. Not the most exciting writer on earth, but Mr. Harris does a good job of exposing and documenting the actual FACTS undergirding the deception of freemasonry. Any Christian would do well to get the actual documentation rather than the heresay ... Harris provides lots of it here."
1,"Oh, irony of ironies...","This author claims to have freed himself from Freemasonry and found God, and yet he claims to have accepted Christ via 'The Sinner's Prayer'... completely ignoring the Biblical doctrine of salvation laid out in Acts 2:38, and re-iterated in Romans 6:3-4 and Colossians 2:12. Having completely misunderstood (and failed to follow) God's plan of salvation, it's entirely possible that he'd have been better off as a Mason; he could then have pleaded Biblical ignorance!!!Thirteen Lessons in Christian Doctrine"
1,MORE EVANGELIST GARBAGE!,"Not worth the read. Not properly researched, clearly uses hate and fear to motivate, draw followers to his way of ""thinking"". A dollar spent on it will fuel more misinformation. If you want to learn about Freemasonry, read a book responsibly written (even if somewhat historically debatable), buy and read Born in Blood, by John J. Robinson."
1,Waste of time,"I'm a Christian first of all because I was born in a Christian family. I could be a Muslin or Buddhist... I strongly disagree that attack people, institutions or other religions is the right way of living. Mr. Harris simply attack not only the Masonic Institution but all religions by saying that only ""our"" God is the real one. God is only one for all the universe, doesn't matter what religion you were raised in. But each of us can interpret whatever we want... Mr. Harris knows how to interpret in order to make money. Congratulations for him as a business man (only). However I think we lose more than we gain aggressing each other."
4,Really Good Effort,"I enjoyed reading this book. The story was captivating and the characters interesting. The romance aspect was perhaps a little drawn out, but that is most likely just my preference speaking as I don't really care for romance in mysteries.Overall though I thought it was a very entertaining read."
2,Not as good as later novels,"This is more of a romance than a cozy mystery novel. I bought it because I really like Ms. Hyzy's other series (e.g. Buffalo West Wing), and was disappointed that the plot wasn't more complex. For more suspense, buy one of her later novels, and check this novel out at your local library."
3,Kind of gloomy,"I am glad to hear that this authors other books are good. She is a good writer, but the characters were pretty depressing. The main character ' s soon to be ex husband is completely unappealling, her continued interactions with him led me to think much less of the main character, and the ex's sidekick was really repulsive.I did not get very attached to any of the characters. Not a bad read, but I kept reading to see if it got better, but no."
2,Too Predictable,"I downloaded this book quite awhile ago and I don't know if it was free or 99cents. In any case, I read a lot of mysteries and what I want a story to do is take me places and engross me in such a way that I'm not trying to figure the story out, the story unfolds and the surprises just happen. Not the case with this book. I knew what was going to happen, I wasn't attached to any of the characters, all in all, not a good read. I read the reviews that praise this as a new author, maybe a first book? I think there's potential, but this does read like a first novel. Definately not worth the price being asked for today."
2,It was okay...,"This is an okay book... however, it just keeps going on and on and on. I didn't feel like I would ever be done with it."
5,Sometimes it is better not to understand,"Because of their generally foul lyrics, this band has acquired a quasi-mythical cult status with its fans around the world, and it works very well like that. However, I have friends that don't understand Russian, and still find the tracks captivating and agree that Shnurov's voice adds a rough edge that works very well with the excellent sound the band makes.This particular CD is a slight departure from their usually foul-for-the-sake-of-being-foul lyrics, the tracks are thought provoking with titles like: `Cocaine, OIL, Freedom, Credit, Baghdad', in fact the CD's title itself `Bread' is a theme for the songs.If you are familiar with SKA and SKA-PUNK you will be very much at home with those track no matter what language they are sung in. If you don't know the genre, then about time you have tried it, and Leningrad are as good an introduction as any."
5,great,This movie got here quickly and was great. It was packaged correctly. I really like the movie we have all the plays.
1,very bad,no comments necessary .. TP needs to seriously rethink his madea concept before he kills the character that made him famous. This is the last straw.... I quit watching after fast forwarding ...
2,TP Fan...BUT not of this movie,"Don't get me wrong, Tyler Perry has created a wonderful character (Madea) that is loved by everyone, especially when she walked onto this stage. I honestly felt like I was holding my breathe from the beginning of the production and then freely exhaled once Madea walked in. In other words, the acting was really bad until Madea walked in.The storyline is also a bit awkward, especially with the surprise (divorce) ending.I do have to give him props, though because during this movie, he was able to convey the true meaning of Christmas and what it means to hide the Word in your heart. Thanks TP!But overall, I was disappointed with this production and hope there is something else Madea can do."
2,Not as good as his others,"I love Tyler Perry and the messages he has in his works. However, this play had a very slow start and didn't really get going until Madea came in. There were some very funny parts, but it was not as good as his others."
4,I love Medea,This was a very inspirational play. I always love the singing and the message in all TP's plays. I have them all even the movies.
5,Hilarious,The most comical Christmas play that I've ever seen. Madea at her best. Supporting actors also do a great job in making us laugh. Lots of talent including wonderful music. Must have for the holidays.
2,WAs not interesting,"I am just not into his plays anymore, I like the movie versions. I though this was going to be different but it left me sleepy after the first 20 minutes."
5,Tyler,"This is one hilarious movie. I laughed so hard I cried. I watch this at least every two months. Love, love, love."
3,Okay,This play was OK but definitely not one of Tyler Perry's best. It was interesting but predictable and not as funny as others.
4,true madea,"im a fan of madea, mainly the plays more than the movis so this one is heartwarming and funny as madea normally is"
3,Mediocrity sprinkled with a little funny,"I rented this play and I thought it was funny. However, once I bought a copy for my Tyler Perry video library, I was a bit disappointed. It was not as funny as I originally thought. The only scenes worth a laugh included ""Madea."" The choice of actors could have been better. I know Tyler likes to stick with certain people, but they don't fit every character well. The character ""Eric"" was way too old to play a college student. ""Japan"" was a joke! ""China"" was pretty cool! I loved ""Hattie!"" However, it was weakly constructed and poorly scripted. I know Tyler does better work than this.One disappointed customer,From Katy, TX"
4,A Madea Christmas: The Play,"Ok, this movie was scarily to close to my real life family. Although they have yet to admit the ""pretend"" part. Good job Tyler."
4,Good Message Play!,"I'm a huge TP fan! I have all of his plays and it wouldn't have been right if I didn't add this one to it. Many laughs through-out this play, great singing, and most importantly good messages getting delivered. It's a must add to your collection, especially if you are a TP fan!!!!"
5,Madea Rocks,This is another great Tyler Perry success. Madea will have you falling off your chair with laughter. The play is well written and presented. It is a reminder that we are all the same no matter where we come from.
4,still funny,"we needed a good laugh during this holiday and thanks to madea we got it.there are a few slow scenes but it was still hand clapping,foot stomping funny."
5,Excellent play! A must see Tyler Perry!,This play was so much fun to see with my parents. We laughed along with the characters and enjoyed the plot. This play had some of the best singing I have heard in a long while. Their ending with classic Christmas carols was so beautiful. I wish I had seen it in person!
2,Mehh.,"I was disappointed with this video. The only other one of his I'd seen was 'Madea Goes to Jail.' I liked that one a lot. But, this one had a message that was a bit confusing. The whole cast got all Jesus-y at the end, but the content and overall gestalt of the plot gave a big huge wink to extra-marital affairs as if they are a normal, acceptable part of life. Also, there were some pretty slow spots that seemed like a good time to get up and check my e-mail, being pretty sure I wasn't missing anything.On the upside, there were some very funny scenes, and the singing was excellent. The ""moral"" of the story, however, left me scratching my head in wonder."
2,Not too funny.,I usually enjoy anything with madea but this left me disappointed. It seemed drawn out and didn't have alot of humor in it. Loved the other Madea movies but could do without this one.
2,Tyler Perry's A Madea's Christmas The Play,REALLY COULD NOT ENJOY THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT KEPT ON MESSING UP. I KNOW THE MOVIE WAS JUST FOR A DOLLAR BUT I REALLY WAS EXCITED TO SEE THIS MOVIE. AND DISSAPPOINTED THAT I DIDN'T GET TO ENJOY THE FULL EFFECTS OF THE MOVIE.
4,Madea Does It Again,Enjoyed this. Needed the laugh at a very sad time in my life. The play was very entertaining. The singing was awesome.
3,Madea,"We like all the Madea plays and especially movies, but this one was just average for me. I have also come to realize that Tyler Perry is more about philosophy than the word of God. I objected, when Tyler (as Madea) asked the snobby woman if she was a Republican, as if Republicans were a lower life form. Compared to what? Socialist and Communist Democrats?. Maybe I am flying off the handle, I have lost a lot of respect for Perry."
4,thanks,"wanted this dvd for stocking stuffer, couldn't find it in any stores!!! ordered and was shipped in time..thanks for the fast and courteous service."
1,"Tuhrrrable, just tuhrrrrable...","I basically have to agree with all the 1 star reviews already made. Very uneven script, atrocious acting, Madea character was more a pointless sidebar than a real part of the story, singing was awful and preaching with a sledgehammer is never appreciated in entertainment. I can go to church for that.Two thumbs way down."
5,A Madea Christams,"Really enjoyed it, just which I could download it to my computer because sometimes the internet acts up and I cannot see it. But enjoyed it."
4,Funny,"As usual Tyler Perry's plays are very funny, but this movie was pretty long. I bought it for my sister for Christmas and we all watched it Christmas night but unfortunately we all fell asleep by the 2nd hour. I believe it's at least 2 1/2 hours long"
5,Great gift!,"This movie was requested as a Christmas gift for a dear friend. I did not watch the movie, however it arrived on time and in great condition! Thank you!"
3,Rent it or Buy it cheap,"This was clearly a rushed play. The first 30 minutes was slow and drawn out, and when the storyline finally began to pick up, the ending was wrapped up too quickly. Madea was funny, but when she couldn't save the storyline. His plays are beginning to become too predictable. I hope this isn't the downhill. The singing was great as usual, but when is the acting and storyline going to become a little more complex."
5,Great Play Once Again!!!!,"My husband and I saw this play live and I must say that it is another one for the books! It was hilarious. Everything is not always as it seems that is for sure. Mr Perry always knows how to bring it. This is worth buying and if you haven't seen one of his plays live, you are missing out. There is nothing like it. And for the Nay sayers, keep your comments to yourself! We must uplift one another and if you do not like Mr Perry then keep it moving."
5,the baddest Black film-maker over the past 30 years bar none,"can't nobody fade Tyler Perry. that is the hardest working baddest Brother making filmz today as we speak. Bro Man is on some Charlie Chaplin meets R.kelly tip and it works. i mean he can beat you in so many ways with his gift of story telling and keeping it real and yet he stays humble bout it, bout it. i enjoyed the way the story unfolded. i watched it the other night,chilling by a fish tank and eating some peanut butter and jelly sandmiches and dranking some lemon water. Tyler Perry writes out his characters and nails it proper. the Hood meets the Burbs and it works. TYler Perry outta have about 3 oscars by now easily and other awards. nobody out works Tyler Perry at all. film, tv, music, books, plays who else is seeing his versatility? this is good for the holidays.this film was so tight that the christmas tree and the fish tank glowed as if it really was christmas day outside."
3,More acting less singing!!!!,I just watched this dvd last night w/my family for Christmas..While we all enjoyed different parts of the play the singing just became too much..It seemed like after every conversation between some of the characters they would always break out in song.It just became ridiculous after a while and the play was long as hell..Most of my family members were asleep before the play even ended..I'll just stick to Tyler's movies.
4,Works as Expected,"Length:: 0:32 MinsI use the Remington Safety Vest to increase visibility of my dog afield, and during early-morning/late evening training (including field training). I am still using the first vest I purchased when my dog was less than a year-old. I have used it about daily training (including some high-grass cover) over the last year. The vest is held on the dog by velcro - the vest looping around the collar, and an elastic strap around the mid-section. This makes the vest pretty easy to put on the dog. Wear-points are as expected. The velcro around the collar wore-out first, followed by the stitching on the velcro at the mid-section. I am now about in need of a replacement, but I expect I will buy another Remington vest. Video is dog hunting with vest in corn/sourgum field."
2,dog vest,"Great service from seller, but item is not what I hoped for. Difficult to get leash attached through small neck hole, and if you skip that step the vest slides side to side on dog-not comfortable."
2,Dog tore it off in 6 seconds,"The quality of the product as it is seems good, but this vest is held on with Velcro that is too easy to pull off. My dog pulled this off in 6 seconds. I can't make this stay on him. There is only the one belly band and another flap that wraps around the collar also held on with velcro. I bought another brand for my larger dog which cost just a few more dollars which had several straps with disconnects that had not only a belly band but leg straps front and back besides the belly band. For my dog at least, i'll have to find something like this."
5,Picking up where he left off...in the early 70's!,"The new Iggy Pop album is just incredibly good. This is the work of a 20-year-old --nobody does this at 55, or however old Iggy is. I don't know why this surprises me- Iggy has enough to be angry at, but BEAT `EM UP is really raw. It isn't like anything he's done since his Stooges days. THE IDIOT and LUST FOR LIFE are great and showed growth for Iggy, but they lacked the anger and volume of FUN HOUSE and RAW POWER. Iggy seemed to get lost in the 80's. Despite churning out several albums since, he never really seemed to regain what he lost until now. BEAT `EM UP it seems like the next Stooges album - like something out of the early 70's. This is an album I never expected to hear. Whatever inspired him to go back to this should be passed around to Bowie and Lou Reed."
4,Iggy Pop - 'Beat Em Up' (Virgin),"'Beat Em Up' just might be considered to be Iggy's best effort since 1990's 'Brick By Brick'.Great 2001 release to hit the music racks.The cuts that I had a hard time getting out of my head were ""Mask"",""L.O.S.T.""(where the legend chants In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida several times),""Howl"",the ass-kicking ""Jerk"",""Death Is Certain"" and ""Drink New Blood"".'Beat...' is Iggy's first entirely self-produced CD.His band on this disc is:Whitey Kirst-guitar,Lloyd Roberts-bass and Alex Kirst-drums.Basically,just some old-school Detroit style in-your-face bitter rock&roll.Listen closely to the Igster's descriptive lyrics and you'll know why this world really is going to hell in a hand basket.I FINALLY after 23 years got to see Iggy play live on this CD's tour and I wasn't let down one bit.I remember that when I got my ticket at the door,I honestly felt like I did the day I lost my virginity.Virgin Records,no pun intended.Great disc to own a copy of."
5,Beat 'Em Up Kicks Buttt!,"Iggy has been a motivating force in my life for more years than I care to tell. Ave.B was a great CD, but thats not the music that pushed me over the edge. This album makes me jump around and screem! The band rocks like a Mack truck. Go for the Throat! It makes me want to conquer the world.Thanks Iggy!"
2,Not the Stooges,"I got this after reading it was a ""return to the Stooges"". It's better than Avenue B, but that's not saying much. This definitely isn't a return to the Stooges and I'm deeply disappointed. Iggy isn't whimpering on this at least, but none of the songs grab me. I'll stick to my old Stooges and Iggy Pop releases and bootlegs."
1,Out of touch,Iggy seems to have Popped. This album is droll and boring. It feels like he just cranked this out trying to get some teenage metal fans??? Iggy the Stooge is gone. What's left is pap. Disapointed long-time fan that is moving on.
3,The Crooner Excels,"I haven't liked an Iggy solo record since ""Soldier."" This one is exceptional--and I like it.Iggy, perhaps under Bowie's nefarious influence, somehow got it in his head that he was not the disinterested nihilist of his first record, nor the screaming Id of ""Funhouse,"" nor the perverse, superior presence of ""Raw Power""---no no no--he was going to croon, he was going to be a singer....We the admirers sat through his first solo stuff, understanding what he'd been through. We knew it was a time for changing, as the hippies say. Yet by ""Party"" it got irritating. By ""Zombie Birdhouse"" we moved on.When I saw Iggy on PBS a year or two ago oooooing aaaaaahing like a supper-club Fabio, I was disgusted.Then I bought ""Beat Em Up."" I had heard it was good--and dammit, it is. It sneers, grimaces, snarls; it twists its body and taunts the crowd.Oh my----Iggy is back. The REAL Iggy.I recommend this."
5,Once again RAW POWER !,"Iggy Pop is one of the greatest songwriters. He has proved it thru his long career, from the Stooges to his solo career. I'm aware that Iggy has released few awful album, but this, Beat 'em up... really beats things up."
3,Iggy in a holding-pattern.,"This is definitely a return to a harder-rocking Iggy. Mainly, he's tunelessly ranting over metallic riffing. Not that that's a bad thing. But there's not a lot going on here songwriting-wise--and this guy is capable of writing great songs that also happen to rock out. This is no ""Funhouse"". It's not awful, but this isn't Iggy at his best."
1,Got an ugly plastic dish NOT silver plated,"I ordered this through Amazon, paying extra for fast delivery because I needed it for a party. The package arrived today (said it was sent from ""Shoppersoutietz""); opened it up and found an ugly plastic chafing dish that I now have to spend time returning, etc.BEWARE, especially if you are short of time."
2,liner missing,"The silver chafing dish arrived on time, but in unpacking it there was no ""ovenproof liner"" (as described) included. This caused a frantic search for a pyrex bowl that would fit as the occasion was the next day. Could not find one that was ovenproof but did use a make-shift version."
4,Vangelis - 'Heaven And Hell' (Windham Hill),"Originally released in 1975, this looks to be his third solo effort - didn't know (until now) that Vangelis was a member of the Greek progressive band, Aphrodite's Child. Hadn't heard this CD in ages, as I've never really kept up with his work that much. Liked this ageless neo-classical / New Age title more so than I remember. Both tracks here - ""Heaven And Hell, Part 1"" and ""Heaven And Hell, Part 2"" - clocking in at over twenty minutes each. Jon Anderson (Yes) provides the vocals on ""So Long Ago, So Clear"" - a portion of the Part 1 cut, I'm sure I used to hear that song on late night FM radio many moons ago. Thoroughly enjoyed this CD reissue's beautiful symphonic passages that manage to take the listener(s) by surprize. Should appeal to fans of Patrick Moraz, Yanni, Tangerine Dream and Mike Oldfield."
4,A must-have for a fan,"Except from the song ""So Long Ago, So Clear"" the CD is full of dynamic, powerful and experimental music. Unfortuanlly packed in two big parts, each with several different parts of music."
2,not what I expected..,"Having heard segments of Heaven & Hell on the acclaimed ""Cosmos"" by Carl Sagan.. thought I would love the whole CD...Truthfully I was not impressed, most of this Vangelis composition consists of harsh, discordant janglinging sounds, the vocals at the beginning DO sound Hell-like and slightly offkey!Yes, there are quite hauntingly beautiful portions, but too few... I cannot speak for everyone, but I expected more... this music just too ""noise"" sounding ."
2,It's not...,"It's not Spiral, Albedo 0.39, or China. It's okay but nothing exciting. If you like his mushy bland stuff, buy it, but if you like Dervish D, Pulstar, and the sound of keyboards being pushed to their limit of expression, don't bother."
3,Nicole please read;,Hope you see this message. I read your review which remined me of my similar experience with Oxygene at age 6. I could almost picture the alien landscape. As a child I had many dreams of space because of it. I still listen to the copy my father made me 17 years ago.
4,"great book, but i wouldve liked a hardcover.","this book is a great reincarnation of the ""x-men"". i didnt buy this from amazon, i actually got it b&n. mark miller was doing great on the ""ultimate series"", and this was better than i thought it was going to be. it seems alot like the movies(x-men, and x2)with these two arcs. the first arc is an intro to the x-men as they get involved with the sentinels! also they somehow find a great way to get magneto involved with the sentinels without it just being magnetos being chased by the sentinels! the second arc involves the weapon x program,and shows some of the problems with ""protecting the humans and help them understand the mutants"". also this has beast becoming blue and hairy! oh, and has freaking nick fury before he was in the ""ultimates""! overall great book! worth the price!"
2,Some of Millar's worst work,"Every month I'm a bigger Millar fan. After reading this book for a second time, I have to say that it's not so good. Compared to Ultimate Spider-man, The Ultimates or other Millar work this volume is a bit of a disappointment. It's not terrible, just not as good."
2,OVERPRICED,"This first volume of ultimate x-men is diffenetly an average comic. The storyline is not bad, its ok and the art work is good. The major downside is that it is overpriced. So with the story line, the art, and the price it averages to about 2 stars."
2,"Great book, poorly made","I bought this for my sons who love the X-Men. It's a really great collection, but the book is so poorly made that the pages started coming loose (like totally out of the book) within two weeks. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in this. And the way the book is made, it's not something I can easily fix--taping is next to impossible unless I don't mind pages being askew and the book not closing properly. I do mind. It was an unfortunate waste of money."
5,carry on duffel bag,This Samsonite wheeled duffel bag is a joy. No more lugging heavy carry-ons through the airport. It holds quite a lot and I would highly recommend it.
4,Review...wheeled duffel,The duffel served us well on our trip. Positive = cost. Negative = inability to keep the duffel in an upright position with the handle extended as you are waiting and moving forward in security lines at the airport.
3,Samsonite 22' Duffel,Lots of room for the size. Not very pleased with use. While using handle and wheels you are unable to stop without it falling over. bad design.
3,Handle is too short!,"Since this bag was no longer available with Amazon, I purchased it at a different website. The bag itself is nice enough, but the handle is not long enough! I'm 6'3"", so maybe that has something to do with it, but the whole purpose of buying this bag was to be able to drag it through airports, not carry it! If that is what you have in mind as well, then I cannot recommend this bag."
4,Can't stand upright on its own,"The luggage was as described, but I should have listened to other reviewers when they said it can not stand upright. I received it and tested it out at home and could not stand it. No pun intended. It kept tipping over. I could lay it down when checking in and when waiting in line at security, but I know I will be annoyed by it. Also, It does not have enough compartments for storage. It only had the one big one and the two on the sides. I prefer a bag with more organized pockets. Overall, the bag seemed spacious and fit my clothes for a week business trip. Was just not for me."
4,Harcastle Does Not Disappoint,"This is Hardcastle at his best. I'm tellin' ya, this guy is a musical genius (in his own right)."
4,A Great Summing Up,"This 2 CD set is a great (if somewhat suspect) collection of most of what you need from YMO. Dock them half a star for skipping the entire (very good) NAUGHTY BOYS album, though. Don't believe the hype, though - when it claims that ""Behind the Mask"" is from ""Italy Seven Inch"", or that ""Cue"" is ""from US Promotional Twelve Inch"", you may notice they sound exactly like the album versions. However, there are some rare goodies here, like the 12"" version of ""Tighten Up"" (""David Bowie's doin' it, even Elvis Presley used to do it!""), and the ""Germeny Seven Inch"" version of ""Madmen Everytime Look Aroun (I Hear the Madmen Call)"" (enjoy your Nice Chinese Food with chopstick), which is great. E-mail if you need a track listing."
4,Speed Training,"Very good, hard workouts. The three workouts are each about 30 minutes. If you really want to work hard you can do two. I also like the hill workout, Up Up the Hill. They all get your heart rate up."
3,eXCELENTE,El libro es muy bueno y sobre todo da esa información tan valiosa del mundo latinoamericano. Su descripción de la vida es espectacular
3,One step back,"As an avid fan of their first, I awaited Audio Bully's latest with fiendish anticipation. Given how fresh alot of their first stuff was, this second album was just a little bit of a let down. Whilst the laid back beat stuff is good, the more up-beat stuff is nothing compared to the first. They seem to have reverted back to the god-awful mid-nineties Robert Miles style of cresecendo tunes, which was something of a step-back given how progressive their beats were in their first album. Worth buying if you're a fan, just not as good as the first."
2,what went wrong?,"I am still at a loss to figure out how the audiobullys went from producing one of the best dance record of recent times in ego war with its gravely vocal,big beats and well layered original use od samples to this piss poor effort. i heard shot you down last summer and while it followed the same format of face in the clouds it was still a bangin tune and i hoped that it would set a precedent for the rest of the album. needless to say it did'nt, this is the only stand out track on the album the rest of it doesn't even come close. the only other highlight of the album is an apperence from suggs (formerly of madness)who spouts a few classic lines like ""i was casauly sorry"". thats how i felt after spending money on this album"
5,AC Cheese and Cracker Set,It is wonderful and will be greatly appreciated by the receipient who is an avid Arthur Court collector.Tom
2,Charles Darwin's important influence on scientific thought,"Peter Bowler presents a synopsis of Charles Darwin's contributions to science, history, and culture. This book tries to provide a quick summary of the important periods in Darwin's life, touching briefly on each significant aspect.Much of the book is written in a somewhat technical way and is a bit too wordy. I had a difficult time maintaining my interest while I was reading some of the chapters. Certain areas deserved more coverage, like the reaction when Darwin went public with his theories.On the positive side, this book does give some good insight on Darwin's relationships with the other prominent scientists of his time and there are some moments where the slowness of the book becomes more interesting, like the section that covers Darwin's voyage of discovery aboard the Beagle. Overall, however, Bowler does not really present anything new or profound that we haven't heard before."
1,Twaddle,"Misses the point completely. Typical liberal, permissive parenting twaddle from an anti-military, Bush-bashing feminist. Did you expect otherwise?"
1,Lies,"Folly- A book of unreal comfort for those inside a world of uncomfort. Jesus this, Jesus that. Read the Bible instead."
3,alright book,"it has some great examples. half the book is great, the other half is just way to much. if david cut out the 'other' half, it would be a fabulous book. It is, however, the best swing book on the market right now. ( after reviewing 5 seperate swing books )i am looking for something better to come out though.A good combination of his book and kathy's book, The JFC Swing Tutorial, would be an excellent start. OR if david would have kept a similar format like he did in Graphic Java v. 1, AWT."
1,almost worthless,"I really don't understand why this book has such a high rating. I've found it to very poorly written and bloated with useless information. Even as a reference book it's pretty bad (it's definitely not for learning swing); the layout is horrible (both visually and logically) which makes it hard to skim through to find the relevant sections (if they are in there at all). Half the book is lists of methods from the api with almost no explanation. i can get these from the ide without having to look in up in a 1600 page book.Although this is the only swing book I have, I never use it even though I mostly program in java/swing. Instead i use the swing tutorials on the sun website and other sites. It's much more concise and easy to read/understand."
2,Not enough wood ; too much trees,"I am having some issues developing an application using Swing and this book is helping me very little. Its biggest problem right now for me is that it doesn't have a section covering layout managers -- quite amazing for a book of over 1600 pages supposedly dedicated to Swing. Maybe layout managers aren't technically part of Swing (??), but they should be in here.In general, there is a lot of information in this book which doesn't help me much, or is no more than is available free from Sun's website. The information I really need in order to understand Swing and solve my problems -- such as how the layout managers work and how the virtual machine decides when to execute queued GUI requests -- are either not here at all or so deeply embedded within a mass of superfluous information as to be useless. I'm going to return my copy."
5,A good reference,This book saved tons of time with great and detailed examples on almost every situation a developer might face while developing a Swing application. This book never failed me.
2,Sorry - I'm going to have to disagree,"I own 3 books on Swing...and I never reference this one. This book's content is badly organized, and the information is badly presented. If your skeptical, grab a really good Swing book like ""John Zukowski's Definitive Guide to Swing for Java 2"", and pace yourself on the speed you grasp the subject matter, and hands down you'll learn faster with Zukowski's book. It's not enough to have all the info in a book, it's how it's presented and explained. I'm a fan of the Core Java books, so I was excited about this one, but ended up disappointed."
1,It is definitly overrated.,"I have many years programming experience including Java.After reading so many positive reviews, I bought this book. But I really don't like it much! I read it just like reading JavaDoc from sun's java API documents. When the author try to explain something, he did not explain it clearly. I have to read the code and read Java API to understand the programs. Some codes, such as those using Internal Frame and Desktop Pane don't work as they should. Read some pages this book before you order. I don't recommend this book."
5,Just the book i was looking for!...,"If you're a java programmer, looking to learn swing, this is the book for you!!.... It covers just about everything, and it does it well..."
2,"Nice examples, Not suitable as a reference manual","Nice book if you do not know much about the JFC. Some good examples. The format of the book does not invite for a close survey. This book is not suitable as a reference. If you want to know about classes, its methods and the way they work it is better to look for something else.To learn, examplewise, it is a rather good book."
4,"Good summary of swing, swing componants","This is probably the best Swing reference currently out. Good intro to Swing theory and architecture for someone coming from an AWT background, as well as nice coverage of MVC in Swing.My only complaints on this book month. Why not just put it on a CD? 2) Organization could be clearer. The jacket suggests to 'cruise the treetops' of the book, and read detail where you need it, but the chapters aren't organized nicely for this purpose, and I often find myself wading through detail to get the overview"
4,Top swing book,"This is, no doubt about it, the top swing book around. Almost all questions you might have about a swing component are answered and if you fell like the java docs don't do a good job at explaining them, this book is for you. All components (i belive) are explained to the extreme (the author even explain the design of it) and there is a usefull table per component explaining which methods in Swing correspond to the ones in AWT, and that is particulary usefull if you need to convert AWT to Swing. There is also a good explanation of the model-view design of the components, which does a good job at explaining the JTree and JTable, the newest and most complex (as an other reviewer mentioned) components of Swing.One thing this book doesn't cover is the Graphic 2D library, but a new book is suppose to come about it.Oh yeah, one of the downsides is that this book is VERY heavy and big, but i guess that's the price..."
3,Not very approachable,"I find this book too hard for beginner + intermediate level. I saw the earlier comments on Amazon & bought the book. But I have not been able to use even one section comfortably. The book is full of details & not very approachable. I would advise any programmer to work with Core Java 2, v1 and complete atleast upto chapter 9 or 10 before attempting to read this book. It is probably not worth the price if you just want to get a feel for some of the components & work them around in your programs. But I suppose java gurus will find it helpful for it introduces them to all the relevant classes & interfaces with respect to particular components."
2,Disappointing for the scope,"For a book that is dedicated to Swing, I found the book uninsightful. The organization of the book is confusing and thus difficult to use. The table of contents are a somewhat helpful in this area, but since there is no index, it is not very useful as a reference text. Unfortunately it not particularly good as an introduction to the Swing interface either, so I am not quite sure who is the best audience. But there is a lot of raw data, so some should find some value from it, particularly if this is the only information available on Swing."
4,Cool Swing!!,If you want to learn and make Swing applications this is the best book. However the size was what made me give this book four stars.
3,Buy 1/2 size up,"I love these shoes. They are comfortable and I was looking for something I could simply slip on when running into town. HOwever, I would recommend buying a half a size, or even one size up. They are ""tight"". The back of your foot just just fits inside the shoe. I'm a size ten (10).Otherwise, great little shoe."
4,Skecher slip-on,"Just what I've been looking for. Very comfortable and easy to wear. Great when you're running around or shopping.I have shopped for a slip on that was not bulky like sneakers, and I found it. Very happy with purchase."
4,Nice little shoe,"This is a cute little shoe, and pretty comfy, but an insole might be needed by some for added support on hard surfaces. Should be cool for summer wear."
4,flirty and fun,i love these skechers for spring and summer when wearing capri pants and shorts. they are very true to size but please don't expect as much a support as regular soled skechers. they are perfect for sight seeing trips but not much for exercise.
1,Dont waste your money,"These are, far and away, the absolute worst shoes I have ever purchased. I ordered these a half size larger, so that my foot would not hang off the back. ( some of the reviews noted that they run small) Well, my foot STILL hangs off the back, AND they are the oddest fit. Narrow towards the front and wide in the middle. So my foot doesnt stay in the shoe, they feel like they are going to go flying forward with every step. I never had a pair of shoes like this before, they are just horrible. (My guess is they werent made in this country) I agree with the reviewer who noted that she spent the entire time trying to keep them on her feet. I bought these to wear to work (pre-school)since we are not permitted to wear sandals in the summer. The sandals would be safer and more comfortable than these. A horrible little waste of money!"
5,Nice and confortable,"I bought these skechers for my girlfriend, and she could't be happier with them. They arrives just on time, and were as nice and confortable as announced"
3,They are o.k.,"I bought these for comfort and ease of getting in and out of; however, I find that walking in them can be a bit of a chore. As for bike riding, my feet slip out of them because they are a bit wide. I use them around the house or a quick trip to the store. They are not good for long walks. They clean up very well, I washed them and had no shrinkage and they did not turn yellow. Gotta say, Amazon delivers very timely...no long waits for your purchases."
1,My feet slip out!,What a bummer.... I bought these after trying on many pairs of skechers and I *thought* I had picked the best pair. WRONG! They fit perfectly (which is so depressing) because they are near impossible to walk in. It's like the insoles are made of teflon! My feet slip out of them on every step. I spend my whole time walking thinking about keeping my feet in the shoes. I think I nearly sprained my foot trying to keep them on as I walked. I wish now I had gotten another pair. I can't return them because I've worn them. Money down the toilet.
4,Skechers women's bikers-out and about slip on,I really love the ease of the slip on shoe. I bought the shoe about a 1/2 size too large because it was the one I wanted and was not available in my size and there is not that much difference in the two. I feel their arch support and bottom cushion used to be more significant but I do love the shoe. JeanneZ
3,Zuskie,"Needed a comfortable shoe to wear to work but it needed more cushioning, when a wear my socks with it, the shoe easily slips off my feet, the insole is very slippery. Also, I wear a size 8 but it's slightly too small, should have ordered a 8.5. I like the look wish it didn't have those flaws"
2,runs small,I returned them and ordered a size 9 which has the same problem (only a bit more so) than the Keds mules. They run small. I could not get my foot in them all the way with very thin socks.
5,Great run-a-round shoe,"This is my second pair of these shoes. They are so comfortable. They slip on real easy. You can wear them with socks or without. I can't bend over as easily as I used to, so having not to ty them is the biggest plus. They wash well in the machine. Very easy maintenance."
4,"If you liked this, try 'Drowning Mona"" with Danny Devito & Bette Midler","I only just saw this movie today on satellite. It's the perfect bookend to Danny Devito's hysterical ""Drowning Mona,"" a comedy cult classicmy husband and I watch at least once a month. Devito stars with Bette Midler in the role she was born to play. Neve Campbell and Tracy Walter again support, and other cast members include Casey Affleck, Jamie Lee Curtis, Will Ferrel and Paul Ben-Victor. This one requires a few more smarts to enjoy fully. The soundtrack is peerless, too. '70's classics too many to include."
5,Funny movie,"This movie is hilarious, I laughed through most of it. Kathy Bates and Danny DeVIto make a great couple in this movie. I would recommend this for anyone."
5,ROFLOL - rolling on floor laughing out loud,This has got to be the funniest movie made in ages. Danny Devito and Kathy Bates are just hilarious in their roles as the long lost birth parents. Great cast and funny story. I watched it 3 times (not on the same day) and it is still funny.
1,Pathetic,"No wonder this film didn't make the movie theaters. This is an insult to the 15-year-old boys who dominate the audiences. There is not a single laugh, unless you think that accidentally putting Preparation H on your toothbrush is amusing. This is especially dreadful because of the waste of Kathy Bates, a truly gifted actress who should have turned down the ""awful mother"" stereotype. Not even Marjorie Main could have put life into that limp script. In short, the movie is a dead loss. Even fans of ""Jackass"" films will be bored."
1,Somewhat Embarrassing,"I had great hopes for this movie when I purchased it some time ago. When I got around to watching it I was with family members and the movie is so bad we all agreed to turn it off. None of us have any desire to ever watch it again. The comedy is predictible and often embarrassing at times, as is some of the acting. A great disappointment considering the actors involved."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This movie is TERRIBLE!! Do not waste your money or time. These reviews must be fake, there is NO WAY anyone would say this movie was good if they actually saw it. I can't believe so many decent actors were a part of this awful mess of a movie."
5,"I've never wished to sail, but.......","I've never wished to sail, but London Went To Sea with me aboard for the duration of my read. I found the book rewarding in its detail and in the grandness of its focussed vision. The author's style, with reminescenses of Mark Twain, Hemingway, and even Dickens, was fasinating and seductive.I still feel no desire to actually participate in the experiences the author so delightly describes, but now can feel justified by having so closely experienced the joys and difficulties of the reality....which strongly suggests the high level of skill of the writer.Joshua Slocum himself would have been enthalled."
1,Incorrect Product/Description,It is my fault for not double checking the info after the cables arrived. I ordered two cables for our boxer mixes to use during a camping trip in the campground.Both cables did not have the spring loaded strain relief on them. Unfortunately it was past time to return them.
1,Got a year to live?,"If you have a terminal illness, read this book - it will make each day seem like an eternity.This book is not a fun read. There are better ones out there."
4,Works,After years of using my Chicago Cutlery sharpening steel I just couldn't keep a good edge on the knives any more. This sharpener quickly got the knives back in shape to where I can just dress them with the steel again. The abrasive is adhered to a ferrous material so I can hang it on my magnetic knife holder. I wouldn't use this as my only sharpener - you really want to finish with a finer grit.
5,The Ultimate Edge Model 10NC Coarse Diamond Sharpening Steel,"Bought one, then another, and another, and gave them as gifts. I think I ended up with about 4 but don't use them much anymore. Gave me the start for a nice edge so only once in a while, or with a really dull knife. Everyone could use this around the house...kitchen, workshop, game room (or wherever you set up your hunting stuff)!"
2,Ultimate Edge 10c sharpening steel,"Ordered this as I already own the original first medium sharpening steel first introduced from the same maker. I love the finer one that I had previously and thought this coarse diamond steel would help with the more difficult dull problem knives. I was disappointed. I don't think it does a very good job. It is inexpensive, relatively, so it seemed a good deal. You get what you pay for. It was hard to use compared to the finer model, which I love, and have had no problems with . I have been sharpening my own kitchen knives for forty years and I think I know what I'm doing, but I could not get a really good edge with this even in combination with the finer model. I'll stick with my traditional old fashioned steel and the finer diamond model for the finishing. Those two work great."
1,this item is not as pictured,"the picture shows a circular sharpener which is why i purchased it.... it is not circular its one of those flattened ovals which i do not like.... also there is not much diamond dust on the blades.... the price is definatley not worth it,,, i delibrately passed on several oval sharpeners and bought this because it was not stated as oval and the picture shows it as round...update.... i decided to look at the product and try it rather than send it back.... glad i did the plastic tip is cracked and broken and been glued back together and then glued to to end of the product... it was probably dropped on the end, also it seems to be used which accounts for not being as course as 'I' think it should be..."
2,It's ok,"""It doesn't tip over with a diaper bag hanging from the handle and no baby sitting in it."" I have to disagree with that (maybe my diaper bag is to heavy). Mine fell over and broke the cup holder. (both cup holders have broken and in the same place) Within a month or so of buying this the fabric on the foot rest have unraveled. (you can adjust the foot rest to several positions) So now I cannot raise his feet. A replacement is $50something. The handles aren't quite high enough (I'm 5'4""). On a good note, it is easy to fold and unfold, is light to carry and has a handle. My husband thinks it is to ""cheap"" to have cost as much as it did."
4,Remembering Old Miami Beach,"This book has been around for 20+ years and is mostly photographs taken in late 1970's and early 1980's. Much has changed in the ensuing 25 years. Many of the buildings have since been repainted, as in the Carlyle featured on the cover. Some, as with the graceful St Moritz, have been restored (today it looks much different, and better, then in this book's photograph). Best of all this book documents some things that are no longer there as in the wonderful photos of the Tiffany murals, the old Cinema Theatre interior. and the demolished Sands Hotel.The book is broken up into chapters based on architectural details (Facades, Doorways, Materials, etc). The text is well written and gives one a good grounding in the Miami Beach Deco architectural style. Best of all it is filled with wonderful photographs. A great historical record of a time when the Art Deco District had just been formed."
2,Hayes MX-2 brake pads,"I ordered these in the hope that I could get rid of the shrill squeaking that accompanies every effort to actually use the brake to slow down. I don't know if it is the pads or the design of the brake or the rotor, but these brakes just plain squeak. I went on a hilly ride today with a group of 15 and mine were the only squealers in the bunch."
1,Fish NOT on!,"I normally don't review anything, but I felt strongly about this one. The video quality is poor but not as bad as the content. The lines were obviously not rehearsed. The (short) underwater video was very fuzzy and jerky and taken in low visibility water apparently in California around 1987."
1,Pacific Ocean Salmon Fishing,This DVD was not produced well. If I had purchased it from a local vendor I would have returned it for my purchased price or not done business again with this vendor.
4,Smells good!,"Like the other reviewer,I also use this along with Scott Cunningham's book on aromatherapy.Between the two I don't think there's a scent not covered.Morwyn's book I think has more recipes and information on each scent than S.C. but I like them both for different reasons.I recommend this book."
4,Sensible yet sensual scent secrets!,"I found this volume a useful reference. I use it second only to Scott Cunningham's works in the area of aromatherapy. It contains recipes, tables of correspondence, and witty commentary on how to use scent-based spells. I recommend it."
2,Book of Outdoor Garden Plans You Can Order,"This book contains a brief overview of 42 plans of outdoor structures ranging from gazebos to to playhouses to compost bins to swings to bridges. To see the actual plans, you must mail order them. They cost between $20 and $85."
5,Beautiful doll!,"This doll is so beautiful!! I can't wait to give this to my granddaughter, I know she will love it! Perfect for little hands, very cuddly."
5,"Great doll, very safe.","There are no dolls safer than Alexander's. Great company.Beautiful and fun dolls.My granddaughter is named Bailey, after the Madame Alexander doll."
4,Beautiful!,She really is a beautiful little doll. She is just perfect for my 2 year old little girl. Soft and cuddly and exactly what we were looking for.
5,Great book,"Exactly what I was looking for on this purchase. For something I can learn in the time span of reading a book, this went into the depth I was looking for. Specifically, the illustrations of where the continents were at successive geologic time periods."
5,Up Your Business! is POWERFUL,Dave Anderson has written a masterpiece that every business leader simply must read. This is a superb business book that will help any leader become more effective. It is filled with pratical ideas and strategies for taking one's leadership skills beyond the next level. Your business can thrive in these trying times...and Dave Anderson shows you how.
5,Best Book ever written on how to run your business,"If ever there was a man (leader) that I'd want to work for, it would be Dave Anderson. This man knows how to run a tight ship and how to treat employees. This should be a must read for every manager. Because there sure are a lot of them that don't know how to treat their staff. I'm working for Turkeys when I'd rather be soaring with the Eagles! Very insiteful. I'm glad I'm reading it because it's helping me learn how to treat others in the work place."
5,Right to the point,"I just read the preview copy of this book and it is direct, applicable and to the point. It offers very specific ideas from someone who has actually been there and done that. Great stuff. The ""six temptations of successful businesses"" is right on as is the chapter on corporate welfare and how to weed it out. I really liked the actual interview questions and sample ad to find good people as well. I'm getting one for my other managers."
4,in some respects superior to the original broadway cast,"i have both the broadway '73 and london '75 recordings. for my money, jean simmons (london) outdoes glynis johns. but len cariou (broadway)sings circles around mr. ackland. hermione gingold's performance actually improves with age. and the london petra (""the miller's son"") is awesome. i think the opening is perfection; but elsewhere some of the ensemble numbers do have the odd tempo now and then. i know this is not practical advice, but the best solution would be to splice bits from both cd's to create your perfect recording."
5,a beautiful recording,"After proving to producers that she could handle performing the role of Desiree on the National Tour, Jean Simmons was asked to come to London to debut with the show at the Adelphi Theatre. Running for a little over 400 performances the show also featured Hermione Gingold reprising her role of Madame Armfeldt.Ms Simmons is quite affecting as the flighty and insecure Desiree who feels she is ready to pursue romance after years of broken promises and false hopes.Gingold, now qute comfortable and honed in her role; performs the comical and contemplative ""Liasons"" wonderfully.Stephen Sondheim's most complex and multi-faceted score is given a grand treatment here. Almost certainly this is Sondheim's most interesting and most beguiling score which runs the entire gamut of emotions.A must for all true musical theater fans."
3,good,"Great job. The package came on early and helped me out. The price was perfect.I would recommend this to others,"
2,Not the best choice,"I found this recording wanting in many areas. It still befuddles me as to why Msrs. Prince and Sondheim found it necessary to cast leads in both the NY and the London productions with women whose sense of pitch was questionable...character perhaps? As for this recording, the orchestra is not up to par. The strings quite often settle for adequate performances whereas the winds perform quite admirably. The engineering of the recording itself is poor. It is as if the microphone levels were set improperly, not noticed until too late, or that a number of singers performed from another room. Regardless, it is unnerving. Hermione Gingold's performance is exceptional as is that of David Kernan. The NY recording far out-measures this one in all areas."
4,great for flattening stones,bought this D8XX to flatted my set of whetstones. It does a good job at keeping them perfectly flat and it does it very quickly. spend the extra money and get this extra extra coarse and save some time and effort.
5,Got a ruined blade that needs to be sharpened quickly?,"This is a heavy bench ""stone"" by DMT and this is the coarsest diamond sharpener DMT makes. This bad boy really removes a lot of metal quick so if reconditioning and resharpening blades of any kind is on your menu, this is the shop tool to make it happen. NO lubricant is necessary."
5,XXC lapping stone,i got this plate today and finally i could flatten my japanese whetstone. for it's price i wouldn't mind buying it. plus i have amazon prime and i love the extremely fast delivery.
2,"Great features, poor reliability.","I love this laptop when it works. It has all the latest and greatest features. Integrated WiFi is my personal favorite feature. The reason for only 2 stars is that I'm on my 3rd system board in less than a year. But that's not the worst part. The worst part is that each time it took WEEKS to get a replacement system board (it seems that lots of people were needing replacement system boards). So I was out of business for weeks at a time while waiting on a replacement system board, which is totally unacceptable for me. Dell, on the other hand, gets you replacement parts the next day. As much as I love the features of this notebook, it will be my last Toshiba."
4,"I read all four books in this series,","and if I had not thought they were excellent, I would have stopped at book one. So, why not 5 stars? Mainly because things get very ""wordy"" at times, and a bit repetative. Yes Kristina, we know you miss the Old Country, but I don't need to be told this 30 times. We get to really ""see"" the main charactors, even their thoughts (fears, dreams, religious doubtes and beliefs, etc.), but some may find this boring (I did not). This series should appeal to every fan of historical fiction."
1,Don't bother!,"The magazine is great! It hits the news stands in the U.S. a FULL MONTH before the subscription arrives - so don't bother. I have a year (maybe 2 subscription) and I don't bother waiting for it anymore. The previews are then 2 weeks after the races are run. It's really appaling and it seems there's noone accountable. Typical really..... Great magazine. Windsor and The Bish know their stuff! Just get it at the newsstandKS Malibu, CA"
4,Pricey but worth it for F1 fans,"F1 Racing is an expensive option for US-based F1 devotees. But if you are a hardcore F1 follower, then it is one of the few sources of comprehensive coverage. The content ranges from feature articles on the current/past drivers to light technical topics to race recaps and previews. Unfortunately, the magazine sometimes arrives stateside after the previewed races have already been run. That concern aside, the content is both entertaining and insightful. If you are willing to pay the cost, then you will likely be satisfied."
1,Magazines,"will I ever get it? ordered in december they had me as ordering 2, I order all the time and do everyting on the internet never had that problem, now after canceling one and both got canceled had to order it again after getting two copies last month even though they said that could not happen and time would just get added to my current subscription. Will I get three next month or none?good luck ordering mags form here . . ."
3,Not the scarf I ordered....,"The scarfs are nice but...The scarfs I ordered were listed as ""Extra Long Fleece Scarf"" (80""x10"") but the scarfs that were sent were only 56""x 10"".Also, just the scarfs were in the package - No return information, no invoice. Nothing... just two scarfs.For the price I'll ""suck it up"" but I'll never buy from this company again."
4,Warm Scraf,"they're the right lenght also warm, but i'm not crazy about the quality of the stitching. it's good enough for the price i think :-)"
4,Good buy.,"It really is a long scarf! It feels good, is soft, doesn't pill. Is longer but not wider than most my husband has. Bought as a gift for him. He just wishes it would have been black. Like that it doesn't have tassels too."
4,Great scarf,"Very warm scarf with plenty of extra material to ensure you're covered on chilly days.The ONLY thing I'll mention as a negative is the fact that the fleece material is exceptionally good at picking up foreign objects with static, so be sure to keep a lint roller handy!"
5,Attractive and nice shoes!,I bought myself these to work in the hospital in. These are true to size I am a TRUE 8.5. And these look really nice. I was impressed when I took them out of the box. Matches the typical scrubs and gives it a nice look. Great tread and comfortable. They look better in person than in the picture.
1,Fake Fake Fake!,Ordered the 33 oz. and the smell is totally off. I am VERY disappointed. Amazon should really look into this...
1,Do not buy it is a fake,I bought this in 2010. I realize that was two years ago and something was just strange about it. I couldn't put my finger on it. I figured it was from Amazon so they wouldn't allow a vendor to sell something that wasn't the authentic product. I was wrong. I recently bought a bottle from the salon and was able to compare the difference. Whoever was scamming everyone was using handsoap (white) I want to say softsoap in the shampoo container. I haven't figured out what was in the conditioner but it is definitely a fake.
5,Great conditioner,"This is a great conditioner and it won't leave a greasy residue on your hair. For me, its worh every penny."
1,Fragrance.net supplier,"I love Bumble and Bumble products but never received my conditioner ordering from Fragrance.net. I finally emailed them after 3 weeks and they refunded my money the very next day, but all I truly wanted the most was my product.5 stars for bumble and bumble, no stars for fragrance.net supplier."
4,So much better - but why the sync problems?,"I bought the VHS version of the original movie version of this film but was disappointed. I first saw Das Boot (The Boat) as a multi-part TV series and - largely because of the greater amount of time available - it was really interesting. The original movie was so cut that it lost much of the continuity and in some cases the scenes were so bitty that it was annoying to watch.The DVD of the Director's Cut is so much better. But this has a down side - the running time is about 3 hours. But it is worth watching. You do have to cope with some poor sound/vision sync-ing though.As stated on the cover (of the European version), 40000 men put to sea in U-boats during the second world war and only 10000 came back.This film is based on the period of the Battle of the Atlantic after the 'happy days'. There is little happiness in the film, but you must come from it appreciating the bravery of the submariners (whether German or any other nationality) during the war."
5,"Get it right, Amazon!","I love Amazon, but they do seriously need to get their details in their product descriptions correct.In this Das Boot description we have, first, this, in ""Product Details"":""Run Time: 149 minutes""Then, beneath, under ""Editorial Reviews"":""This 282-minute version of Das Boot is the full-length TV series, originally shown in six parts but here edited into a seamless whole.""So which is it? The director's cut of the feature film or the TV series version?Sadly, this discrepancy is an all too common feature in Amazon's descriptions--a tough thing if there are several versions of a film available. (But 5 stars--for any version--of this great film.)"
3,"Worth a look, but heavy on the ""Good German Myth""","As the review title says; worth a look, but unfortunately, it, like it's sister movie, ""Stalingrad"", is a bit heavy-handed in wanting to evoke sympathy for the German side of the story, all the while adding to the revisionist ""Good German Myth"", that's been around for decades.Not surprisingly, every possible anti-Nazi scenario/cliche takes place in both movies.But Das Boot is worth a look if for no reason as it's a good portrayal of sub operations, overall."
2,Das Bore,"""Das Boot"" isn't a bad movie but it's not the cinematic tour-de-force as some have suggested. ""Das Boot"" does have its moments of intense drama but the problem is, they're only moments. The rest of the film consists of long, drawn-out scenes with a lot of nautical dialogue and political rhetoric. Yawn! I give ""Das Boot"" high marks for its realism and technical detail. Unfortunately, there's not enough action to hold the viewer's interest for any length of time, which is something to consider since ""Das Boot"" runs well over three hours. If you're looking for a good war movie to add to your video/DVD collection, I would recommend ""Stalingrad"" or ""Cross of Iron"" instead."
5,Das Boot,"DAS-Aufladung ist eine von Filme am emotionalsten mit einbeziehen, die ich überhaupt gesehen habe. Die Buchstaben werden reich, ohne jene unbeholfenen Momente in den Filmen entwickelt, wenn Sie feststellen, dass der Direktor so tut. Sie sympathisieren mit der Mannschaft und GLAUBEN ihrer Lage, während sie kämpfen, einzwängten in einem gebrechlichen U-Boot gegen die Vorteile. Manchmal wächst der Film langsam und herausgezogen, aber der ist absichtlich, Sie glauben zu lassen, wie Sie in einem Unterwassersarg mit nichts zu tun eingeschlossen werden, kein, wohin man geht. Die Richtung ist groß, der Ton ist fabelhaft! I' VE hörte nie schwache Geräusche, eine Geschichte so vorher zu erklären."
5,Sub lovers highly recommend!,"Outstanding uncut, detailed, emotionally filled action submarine classic. If you watched the original movie in the past and enjoyed it, I would highly recommend this full, uncut version of this movie! The only negative issue I saw in the movie, was the special effects, (i.e. model ships/subs) took away somewhat the full impact of the classic 'sub vs ship' hunts. But I guess that is understandable since the movie was filmed circa 1981. Very good submarine movie; recommend using the subtitles option, in order to feel the full experience of the German crew aboard their U-boat!"
1,A masterpiece torpedoed by Hollywood,"The original version of this movie is a German public television productionand is 6 hours long. It shows the good and ugly in very young people whowere sent to war. The absurdity of war as well as fear, desperation andsuffering of the victims are in the spotlight. This is one of the bestAnti-War movies. Highly recommended, if you can find the original version.The ""Director's Cut"" is a carnage made by Hollywood's simple-mindedmonopolists. Every contrast shown in the original movie is gone. Only thefaceless ugly side is left. Hollywood's wrongdoers take pride in replacingthe sound of an exploding bomb. Hollywood never did and never willunderstand war. And because they don't want you to understand it either youwill never find a translated version of the uncut original production. Thisis censorship of the most disgusting form.At long last Amazon managed to spell the names of the actors right. Cheers!"
5,Superb film. Impressive in scope and portrayal.,One of the best human dramas of all time. You're thrust into the midst of the experience and yearn to watch it again.
5,One of the best movies ever made!,"I have had the other two versions of this movie in the past and I like this one the best. It fills in a lot of blanks left behind. Although the sound isn't the same as the Directors cut, the movie is still good. I think everyone should know that war is not glory, not romantic and it is certainly not fair. I don't know why as a so-called civilized civilization we go back to it time after time, war is truly Hell! And this movie does a good job depicting this."
5,Finally a format which this movie deserves,"This is by far one of the best movies ever made. One item which makes this such a special way to watch this movie is the language and subtitles. Unlike the old VHS ways of finding a store whith the version you want it's all here. Myself I can not stand dubbed movies, too much is lost in the translation of emotions. I have watched this movie in all but Spanish in various formats and this has them all in one nice package.The only downside to this movie is the ""making of"", I was hoping to see allot more of how they did the special effects and the models used.Hopefully with enough excitment over this release the German 6 part tv series will be on DVD one day."
5,"World War II, a U-Boat and the Atlantic","Well Done!This film is about the moment of change in the Battle of the Atlantic, from easy kills for U-Boats to heavily guarded convoys. This is a journey into the madness of war.The movie opens with the crew of U-97 on shore liberty in occupied France. While the drinking is at a height, we get to know the crew members and notice that the captain is only thirty years old. The others look like children.A war correspondent joins the patrol and is told not to photograph the crew until time has allowed them to grow beards. ""We don't want Churchill to know that he is being beaten by children,"" says the captain. But the moment of truth is at hand.This work is well done. After the time of shore liberty, the filming is entirely in or on the submarine. The sounds and odors become real; the close living quarters are everywhere.Well worth the price."
5,An excellent reboot for Das Boot!,"Being about 30 years old I didn't know what to expect from the blu-ray of Das Boot. The picture is very good, while the remastered sound is excellent. I had just gotten my subwofer back from the repair shop. Das Boot gave it a good workout! (Yes it does work) A brand new english dub is perfectly sycronized and sounds good. The original German is also included plus there are some great new and old documentaries. A great package."
5,Possibly the greatest WWII movie of all time!,"This is by far the most intense and breathtaking WWII movie ever made. Wolfgang Peterson makes you feel like you are in an actual U-boat with the realism and the awesome digitally enhanced sound. If you have an awesome digital surround sound system, this movie will bring your system to the limit! Hint to reader: tune down your sub, because when you feel the first depth charge, you might have to buy a new one."
2,MISSED THE BOAT,"I like war movies with alot of action in them. This movies focuses on a German U boat crew at sea being BORED to death waiting to see some action. WAITING-WAITING-WAITING AND MORE WAITING! That is the plot here, you WATCH AND WAIT- for like 3 hours to see a few minutes of action. It really gets the point across of how boring life in a submarine can be. I was so Bored I never finished it. Can't understand so many 5 stars. This movie gets the DAS BOOT from my dvd colletion!"
1,Das Boot - Can't Follow Instructions,"I was on a waiting list for the original version of this film, my favorite. Suddenly, I'm sent a new copy of The Director's Cut, which I already have?"
5,The only version worth watching...,"I have seen this DVD thanks to a local rental. I am quite disappointed that it is out of stock at this moment and plan on purchasing it at my first opporunity. Viewing the director's cut is vital; the extra scenes/length produce the tension that causes ANXIETY. During a scene involving the u-boat crew helplessly outwaiting a depth-charge attack a friend had to leave the room- he mumbled ""way too tense"" as he got off the sofa. Watch this with the lights off and the sound up."
5,"Very good digital sound, feel the real tension in the sub..","I saw and heard the movie 3 times! On the back left side i hear the drips of water, on the back right the clicking of a watch. Complete tension, you are amoung the cast in the sub. Deep sounds from my subwoofer. A complete satisfaction of my senses.........."
5,Unbelievable Acting and Cinematography - downright depressing though,This movie is going to bring you down. That's a fact. But it's hard to deny this movie all the praise it deserves.A classic tale about men who served in one of the most treacherous environments ever known to man. It's also hard not to come out of this without a lot of respect for the germans who served in the U Boat service.
5,Submarine warfare in a German U-boat,"Taut and well-acted drama about a German U-boat crew in WW II. The movie is very realistic and insistent on getting all the details right: the photography is incredible. Perhaps because just about the entire movie takes place inside the sub, usually as it's attacking or being attacked, and none of the crewmen (except for the captain, played by Jurgen Prochnow) ever come alive as individuals, the movie feels mechanical at times: the boat itself becomes the main character.The suspense is amazing, though, and until PRIVATE RYAN came along, there was probably no better war picture that gave viewers a true feeling of what it was like ""being there"" in combat. [There are different versions of this movie, from two-and-a-half to over five hours long; unless you are a war movie junkie, the shorter the version the better, I think.]"
2,Dont make a movie movie glorifying Germans in the US.,"They got what they deserved, remember the Germans were fighting so they could kill all the Jews and take over the world, why would we want them to live? WE DONT. Maybe if i was German or they movie was about Americans i could realte, but im sorry they deserved worse then what they got. Its too long, it doesnt have enough action, no drama, the score is bad, the acting is boderline soap opera, and the dialogue is perverted. U571 is better but not much, if your looking for a better Wolfgang film check out Troy (a great great great film) its a million times better, if you want a better war movie check out Saving Private Ryan of course, its the best war movie ever made. 4 out of a 10 for this."
5,Felt it,"The realism of Das Boot excels in drawing the viewer into the experience, feeling the confinement, the boredom, the danger, the despair, the comraderie. Everything about this film is great: the acting, the script, the direction, the cinematography. Comparing Das Boot to ,say for example, Hunt for Red October is like comparing real life to reality TV. Certainly one of the best submarine movies ever, if not the best. Highly recommended."
5,DAS BOOT,"ONE OF THE BEST WW2 MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN.IT TELLS THE STORY ,WITHOUT BIAS, OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO FAUGHT A VERY DANGEROUS BATTLE. AGAINST AN ENEMY AND ALSO THE ELEMENTS."
5,A War Masterpiece,"The Thing about Das Boot which makes it a good war film are a couple reasons, Wolfgang Petersen makes an interesting point in the war. Although what I don't like is that The Director's Cut had to be played with the movie instead of seeing the individual scenes, Which I hated because I never saw the movie when it wasn't in Director's Cut. Although It makes Das Boot more of an epic it's a very good film and I reccomend this to anyone."
2,das boot,sound track not very good; sycronization of words in German version was off from original.............
1,DAS BOAT DIRECTORS CUT,"Disappointed in purchase. The first side of the DVD has translations in several languages. We chose English. The second part of the disc does not have the same options. The remainder of the movie was in German no option for English, nor sub-titles available. For featured as being a special edition directors cut the purchase was a total rip off."
1,Das Boot,"Can you say ""useless""? Das Boot is a German movie. This particular cut was the Director's cut. To see the whole movie, one would have to flip the disc over on its other side. So we did, expecting to have a menu there to choose English subtitles. Side two does not have a menu and therefore does not provide English subtitles for the end of the movie. Surely, Amazon, you know that some of the products you carry and sell to consumers are defective. Why not tell them?"
4,This 209-Minute Version Is A Good One,"This 1985 effort was re-issued with a longer VHS version in 1997 with surround sound and 60 minutes added to the original video, then put on DVD with 5.1 surround sound. All these improvements made a good movie even better.Considering most of this 209 minute film is done inside a U-boat, a submarine, it's very nicely filmed. Jurgen Prochnow, who plays the lead character - the captain of the boat - is a manly, rough-looking-but- compassionate human being who's riveting to watch. Just as interesting as him are the sounds as the noises from the boat echo through all the surround speakers.I would recommend going with the German language track with English subtitles. The dubbed version has English spoken with a German accent and isn't easy to understand, anyway.....so stick with the way it was made and go with the subtitles if you don't understand German.In summary: yes, it's a little long but generally the film moves at a decent pace and features a good ending."
4,A classic submarine movie,"This is one of the best submarine movies ever made. The director's cut comes in 5.1 surround sound for both audio tracks. It also has behind the scenes and commentary for extras. The picture and audio have been restored and are the best I've seen. If you have seen this movie and liked it, this is a great DVD and worth the money."
4,A must have for Das Boot Fans and War Movie junkie alike,"First off, this is the 6 hour version of the famous movie Das Boot. It has everything that was in the movie version along with new whole scene. The only problem is there isn't much extra features. Unlike the movie DVD version, this one doesn't have the director's audio commentary. The only extra feature it has is the behind the scene that was also included in the movie version. Of course you should own both this version and the movie version."
5,LET ME OUT ! I CAN'T BREATHE !,"DAS BOOT is a director's dream : Wolfgang Petersen's dream. In the special features of this DVD, Petersen tells us he wanted to film the ultimate submarine movie. He was lucky enough to have a producer who let him have the final cut. So he could do it.The only critique I can find is that the movie is a little bit too long but you can't blame Petersen for that. It was his dream, after all.And the movie is terrific. The enemy being invisible, you are invited to care for this german crew, the Hollywood enemy by essence for the last fifty years. And it works ! You feel the doubts of these men, their heroism, the tension and their fear.Jurgen Prochnow is magistral and the production great. You soon understand that the British aren't the only enemy of the crew. They have to protect themselves against fire, water and air.A DVD zone claustrophobia."
3,Kind of long but realistic,"This flix will put to rest any ideas about the glamor of WWII submarine warfare. This flix demonstrates why the Germain's call the Type VII subs ""pig boats"""
4,A masterpiece of anti-war human drama,"But the Director's Cut is too self-indulgent. Its interesting, in the characters that are developed that are left more bland in the studio cut. However for me, I saw for the first time how a studio can add value, and sharpen the message more succinctly, than allowing the Director's their head. The studio cut is better, but both are fabulous, intense, emotional, frightening, masterful films."
3,Pacing Kills It.,"Das Boot is, assuredly, one of the best movies of all time. The Uncut version retains the same suspense, terror, and ability to draw us into these characters' lives, but also loses quite a bit in the process: the ability to keep us engaged. The first time you see those depth charges drop and the whole submarine shake, and the crew is sweating, you're there with them. The second time you see it, you're there, but less scared for the crew. The third time, you don't really care. You downright want to get it over with. Wolfgang transformed a fast-paced masterpiece into a slow-moving test of patience. I'm not sure if this was intentional (to relay the boredom felt by the sailors on the boat) or if he just loved every shot too much, but the film loses everything in timing."
4,Disappointed,"The DVD movie that I bought from Amazon had many parts missing. Some important scenes and dialogues in the original version are not present in the version you sell. I'm really disappointed, and I will not buy anything from Amazon anymore."
2,Director's cut?,"Well, I was thinking of buying this DVD as it is titelled ""Director's cut"". However when I saw the length of the move - 207 minutes - I became really disappointed and I still am.I have seen it on both German and Austrian TV as the series ""Das Boot"". It lasts almost 6 hours. I know that this is a long time - but I taped it anyway.So I am not very convinced that the DVD will bring you all the series showed. What a pity that they cut it down to 207 minutes and titelled it ""Director's cut""."
4,Sound and fury,"The many glowing reviews of this movie disregard the fact that, while ""Das Boot"" is surely a magnificently crafted depiction of life aboard a German U-boat during World War II, the screenplay is dangerously awash with genre cliches. Excellent photography and powerful acting do not compensate for the feeling that we have seen all of this before. With nothing new to chew on, we are left instead to savor the spectacle. And a staggering spectacle it is. Director Wolfgang Petersen makes a very good action movie, and action is all we have in ""Das Boot"". It is no surprise to learn that he went on to direct ""In the Line of Fire"" and ""Air Force One"". Highly recommended, but ""Das Boot"" is not the classic it could have been."
5,If you like submarine movies this is the best,Video transfer is excellent. Audio is excellent. If you like the VHS version you will love this DVD. I could not find a flaw.
5,Das Boot -Directors Cut,"The best Submarine film I have ever experienced !...Excellent cast & photography & motion effects made me feel I was inside the U-96 with the crew while they were submaerged and being bombarded by Allies depth charges...Best seen/heard with the original German dialogue & English subtitles. We strted by viewing the Special Features section of this 2 CD -Directors Cut with a scene by-scene discussion with Director , Wolfgang Peterson , lead actor, Jurgen Prochnow ( ""the Old Man/Captain"" ) & the producer of this special Directos Cut with 45 minutes of addional film footage...All in all a great flim about the human side of war..."
5,THE KING OF ALL SUBMARINE EPICS!!!,This is the type of movie that you watch when you are really longing for a submarine movie. This is a well-made and very realistic epic of a real life German U-boat in WW II Be prepared to spend the whole day watching because it is very long but very worthwhile. It is a must see!Noel Serrano
2,Stick with the VHS vesion,"The original version of the director's cut of Das Boot on VHS is widely, and I think rightly acknowledged as one of the greatest films ever made about men at war, and about submarine warfare in particular. So it was an enormous disappointment to me when I sat down to watch the DVD version of this classic to find that the movie had not only been re-dubbed with different actors, but the script had been re-translated!After spending many enjoyable hours over several years watching the VHS version, I found the different voices and different words on the DVD very jarring, akin to watching a Bugs Bunny cartoon with Daffy Duck's voice!So, if you have never seen this movie, I would have no hesitation in recommending this DVD - it's still a great film. But if, like me, you know and love the original VHS version of the director's cut of Das Boot, then I suggest you stick with it. (I have no idea whether recently produced VHS copies feature the original or new soundtrack and script.)"
5,Das Boot - Director's Cut - a Masterpiece..,"This is truly a masterpiece. A hard hitting, deeply moving film - as real as it gets. Worth every penny."
1,The English Dubbing Pales,"Truly an outstanding film and I agree with all the positive comments. However, I have seen the film 3 times. First in German with English Subtitles, Second Dubbed in English, and again in German with English subtitles.The impact of native German spoken in combat is awesome and cannot be captured in the English dubbed version. The dubbed version just felt so fake. For that reason alone I gave the dubbed version one star. Get the English subtitled version if possible, DVD if you can!"
2,Das Boot,"While Photograpy was excellent, I found the poor quality of the sound,in the German quite distracting; and the cast itself seemed to forget there was an audience. I certainly hope the other DVDs' offer an alternative."
4,Das Boot the Uncut Version,"The uncut version is too long. The story is great.If I were to watch it again, I would probably skip the last 2 hours of the first disc."
5,"a beautiful story, but a sad ending unfortunately","This is an excellent DVD. I really liked the story, except the end is really sad; it is really hard to see the submarine crew die during a massive air raid without being able to do anything about it, especially after all the skills and courage they had displayed before, while they were very successfully fighting against all kinds of odds in their submarine. Apart from the sadness resulting from the last scene, the rest of the movie is really excellent; the actors are good, the atmosphere of the movie is nice, the pace is fine, the suspense is excellent etc. I do not recommend the french translation though."
3,Bought The Wrong Version,"I loved the theatrical release of this film when it was new in about 1985. I watched it on VHS.Now I wanted to update to DVD and didn't really look too closely at the different versions that were available. I figured, ""Director's Cut"" new scenes added, ten bucks, that's for me.Well, they did add new scenes but they also took out scenes, too. Why? And why did they sanitize it? In several scenes they took out an innocent natural swear word, and they cut almost entirely the crew's expression of their real wishes when they think they are returning to La Rochelle.In addition the film was shot twice, I think, when it was made -- once in German and once in English. That is I do not remember the film being overdubbed. Here it is in German with overdubbed English and the dubbing is not so good.I am searching now for the proper version, sheesh."
4,"BEST WORLD WAR II FILM AFTER "" BATTLE OF THE BULGE ""","The content and the story are brilliant except ending with entirely bombed dead of vengeance by the allies. The production is miracle encoded with special sound effects for the U-boat encountered with attacks by the British destroyer and when it was targeted, the explosion sounds are so real emerging from my sub-woofer that even the sofa I sat on is trembling. What a great sound !! Salute to "" Das Boot """
3,A well made classic that leaves you feeling claustrophobic.,"Wolfgang Petersen does a great job of bringing the viewer into the cramped and threatening world of the crew of U-96. While the viewer gains a great deal of empathy with the crew of this doomed U-boat, one also gets the feeling of tedium too. This movie is slow at times; in fact, it can be down right boring! I find that I have to be in the right mood to watch this video as it is the kind of movie that demands the viewers full attention. Still, the cinematography and remastered digital stereo sound are nothing less than spectacular! If you have nothing to do for a few hours and you want to watch a captivating film, by all means check out a copy of ""Das Boot."" Better still, add it to your collection."
5,Best sub movie ever made,"This is the best sub movie ever made. It is accurate and gripping. The sound in the DVD version is incredible. Waves wash all around you from one corner of the room to the other.The movie is best viewed with the English sub-titles because the English dialogue is not entirely accurate--it is close--but could have been better. As others have said, you probably won't be bothered much by reading the sub-titles--the movie is that good--it makes a mockery of the recently released U-571. The DVD also has a decent amount of extras that are worth watching.Don't miss this one."
2,Proceeds for sales of this item should be examined first,"I was not aware when I bought this product that part of the proceeds go to causes to which I do not subscribe. Amazon suggests under their ""What makes a good review?"" section that we ask ourselves, ""What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?"" I'd have wanted to know where some of the profits go. The product is truly lovely, but my conscience wouldn't leave me alone when the insert in the box told me where some of my money went, so I sent it back with a short explanation and got a prompt refund. This may not bother other people. It did me. You might want to check out the disposition of profits before you buy, but the product itself is truly lovely and functional. If I can find a similar shape and size, I'll buy it from another vendor."
1,Horrible:(:(:(,"It stinks so bad I can't belive I wanted to see it:( if Elijah Wood was in it I would give it 1,000,000,000,000 stars because he (Freakin rocks!) but he isn't so I give it 1 because...........It stinks the only reason I keeped watching was because Cameron Diaz was in it!"
1,a waste of time,The poor storyline and unbelievable twists in this movie make it unbearable to sit through. Cameron Diaz's acting is overly exaggerated - a disappointing performance by a normally talented actress.
3,Hmm.....,"Interesting thriller that starts out fairly decent but gets confused and muddled and really unbeliveable toward the end. For the Die-Hard Cameron fan only. (Come to think of it, what guy isn't?)"
4,The wet head is dead,"This movie ""Head Above Water"" (1997) is packed with top-notch actors such as Harvey Keitel and Cameron Diaz. A plus is the great aquatic scenery.You want to start figuring out what is going to happen from the beginning of the story. You may draw conclusions; however you are wrong.As the different problems arise for each of the characters, their correction attempts only cause the problems to snowball. I keep thinking of Dave Barry ""Big Trouble"" [UNABRIDGED] ISBN: 1567404596 and how Dave starts out saying something that seems innocuous and soon it gets blown out of proportion and you find yourself defending some indefensible illogical stance. This film starts out with a simple problem that in the end looks ridiculous. But at the very last moment it takes care of its self (or does it?)Did I mention it is a lot of fun?"
4,My cats love the toothpaste,"The first few times I brush a cat's teeth, they fight it.... then they decide they LIKE IT and I have to hide my own toothbrush(es), or they climb up on the bathroom counter and gnaw at them trying to brush their own teeth. I've even had a cat follow me into the bathroom, stand on the counter and head-bonk my elbow while I'm trying to brush my teeth because they want me to brush theirs.I don't know what it is about this toothpaste, but they love the stuff, and having their teeth and gums rubbed with the little brush seems to bliss them out. The only negative is that the rubber finger-tip brush is a useless waste of materials... they don't like it and it falls off my finger when I try to use it anyway.Want to add a new means of making your cats happy to your arsenal? Brush their teeth with this stuff... they'll fight you the first couple of times, then they'll come running for you to do it more.... showing their silly side in the process."
4,"Good show, very short DVD collection","I watched parts of episodes on NBC for awhile and didn't think this show was very funny. It bored me and I didn't think about it again until I watched a couple of episodes of Season 1 in their entirety and discovered what I had been missing. This is a very well-written and humorous show. The only caveats to it, is that you really have to be able to tolerate Steve Carell, since he is featured on about 90% of this show. I don't think they would be able to write a show that didn't center almost directly around his humor. Secondly, the first season is only made up of six 22 minute episodes. You can watch the entire thing in 2 hours. The DVD contains some bonus scenes and audio commentary, but you're still not getting as much in this set as you might be expecting based on other TV show collections."
3,Great show,"Season one must have been a filler show- there aren't many episodes in this dvd.But it's fun to see how the characters have evolved from the first episodes.Recommended for many laughs, but not for younger viewers."
5,The only show on TV I find worth watching,"Season 1 is very short, but still the best season. This show is definitely not for everyone. People always call me the king of dry humor, but I know they are just calling me a jerk. If you are one who finds dry comedy to be funny, then this show is gold. Steve Carell has proven to be one of the best comedic actors around in movies like '40 Year Old Virgin' and 'Anchor Man', but 'The Office' is where he fits in the best. Funniest show of all time."
5,Sometimes you have to be the boss of dancing,"Finally, a comedic television american viewers can be proud of.Dwight Schrute is one of the most dead on characters ever commited to film. I know that guy. I mean, I really KNOW him. His cubicle is next to mine at work. He may have a different name, but he IS Dwight Schrute. You probably know him, and Michael Scott, and all the others. Watch and laugh and revel in the shared catharsis that is The Office."
4,Tears of laughter... and embarrassment!,"This award-winning series was first shown in the UK 2 years ago (there has since been a second series), and swiftly became THE show to talk about around the watercooler. It is probably the funniest British TV comedy since Fawlty Towers, and certainly since Blackadder.The trick is that at first you believe it is a reality TV-show (handheld cameras, speaking directly to camera, etc) which works wonderfully well. Once you have got used to this, the laughter comes thick and fast. However, its ability to make you absolutely squirm with embarrassment (even more than Fawlty Towers)is also a major highlight.I urge you to watch this. Have some friends over and just treat yourself to the funniest show for a long time.By the way, the only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is because the second series is even funnier!!"
5,The funniest show on TV,"The funniest dry humor on TV. The season just doesn't have enough episodes! But who are we kidding, I could watch these episodes again and again. My favorite- ""The Alliance"". ENJOY!!"
4,Too Funny,This is a great show though I think the second season was better. Season 1 is great if you missed it...here is your chance to catch up.....plus it includes some great deleted scenes.
4,FUNNY show - but WAIT for the COMPLETE DVD set !!!,"This show is wonderful. It does not work as well as the UK version when it comes to the ""Mockumentary"" aspect- it works better as a sit-com with cinema verite technique used.... BUT this DVD is probably a rip-off. You KNOW a complete DVD det will be released within a year or two. If you love the show, rent this DVD and wait for the complete to come out!"
5,great show,"it's an instant classic. i would not be surprised if it was cancelled,because it is too sophisticated of a show. it reminds me of police squad in the 80's with Leslie Neilson. the lack of a studio audience makes it even better. i wish it was a hour long show"
5,The Office - The Complete First Series,"Never have I laughed so hard in my life. The Office is a show I'd wanted to see but had not seen until recently - until my sister insisted that I had to watch it. I am so happy I did. This BBC series is my favorite; right a long side of Absolutely Fabulous. Sometimes the reason comedy is funny, is because it is true. I feel like this theory applies to the humor in this series. If you've ever worked in an office for any period of time, then this show might have you in tears from laugher. You just might be able to relate. I nearly seem to be able to breathe while watching the show because I'm laughing so much. I don't even feel like you have to be a fan of British comedy to enjoy it. The Office is the first British sitcom for over 25 years to be nominated for a golden globe, and the first ever to win one. That alone says much about this series!"
3,The Begining,This is the begining of the show and it's the 'Pilot of funny'. It came when it was suppose to
3,Only 1 disc =[,"Only had a couple episodes, which were OK. For this series, they do get better as they progress."
1,Too Much of an Already Good Thing,"Why would you possibly want to try to remake The Office?! Anyone who has been a fan of the British version from the beginning would agree that although the American version has it's moments (few and far inbetween), the British version was absolutely incredible...and simply cannot be duplicated. The magic of Ricky Gervais as David Brent is something truly unique and an intimidating force to reckon with. Steve Carell, not surprisingly, does a very poor job of imitading the outlandish, egotistical, and sad antics of Ricky Gervais...and Carell is probably the best character in the series! As well, they went ahead and copied actual scenes from the original!...how could they be any more creative? I would not recommend this DVD unless you HAVE NOT seen the British version. If you were a fan of the Brit series...stick with the BBC, this American wash-out has nothing on the original."
1,dissaster,the office was supposed to be an english show using english humour you try to use american humour its just not going to work at all
1,No false advertising here,"The Office is an origanal and brave new ""comedy"". That fact alone does not mean that the show is good. Mabey I made a mistake when I sat and tried to watch the whole thing at one time. It was painfull trying to keep my attention on this show. Don't get me wrong the show is insightfull, reflective and unlike anything else on TV. But it is also dry, very dry. Perhaps the show will be more palatable when I rewatch it one episode at a time with a weeks pause inbetween each painful episode. If you are considering buying this DVD please note that a lack of laugh track, a soundtrack, and the usual compliments of TV sitcoms means that you will be watching an office, and just an office."
2,Didn't like it,"I didn't like the Office. It just wasn't funny. Maybe it is to other people, but I felt I wasted my money on it."
1,How did this crap ever get on primetime?,"Childish garbage, produced for Morons. Stick with the adult and brilliant original Bristish version, with its colourful characters, they couldn't even get that right over here.Avoid this Trash at all costs, waste of time and money.NOTE-American versions of Brit comedies do not work in the States. Certainly not when toned down for primetime."
1,The British Version Is Just As Bad As This One!,"I gave a review on the first season of the BBC edition a little while back and I mentioned how poor and boring it was. Yesterday I viewed the first episode of the American version of this farce and it was no better. If you people want to watch something entertaining & funny, then I suggest you watch ""Everybody Hates Chris"" and/or ""Scrubs."" Don't waste your time on The Office, from either Continent."
1,This goes on the list of things that never happened.,"I refuse to accept the fact that this was made and aired. Much like The Godfather III, Jaws II and III, Smokey and the Bandit III, Rocky V, The US Red Dwarf TV piolt, this never happened....at least for me.On second viewing, my first reation was unfair. Once, there series finds its own voice, and stop being an American version of the BBC Office, it is one of the best show on TV."
3,The office English version is better...,The English version was a lot better With Ricky Gervais but I would say that I'm English. It's so good because people do take themselves that seriously in some offices.I took the English series of the DVD to my friend in SF way back in 2002 and it went down very well. Didn't get it at first but loved it after the first episode. It was refreshing as the only British comedy she'd liked - or possibly seen - before that was Monty Python. Which is little before my time...
1,RAUNCHY,"This show has its funny moments (not as many as the American version) but it is flat-out raunchy. And by raunchy, I mean: vulgar, smutty, crude, earthy, obscene and hands-down dirty. Almost every single joke is based on sexual situations or a part of the human body.If you have any standards at all, leave this one alone and try the american version, much cleaner and much funnier.Too many ""breakfast beans"" in this piece of TV crud. It's like eating a sandwich with a big beatle inside of it. There's some good to it, but you have to eat trash to get to it."
2,A Poor Imitation,The BBC version is great. The NBC version is awful. I guess they had to dumb it down for the American audience.Sad....
1,Awful,"I don't even know where to begin, so I'll just say, it's not funny at all. It is nowhere near the genius of the American version. The British cast was terrible except for Tim who is the only good one. The episodes were too long and I think they should have made the American version 40 minutes and the British version 20 minutes. What kind of name is Wernham Hogg? At first, I thought Dunder Mifflin was weird, but compared to that, HOLY CRAP! I bought this thinking it was going to be as good or better than the American version but was sadly disappointed.In conclusion, I think this is just a terrible waste of time and money and would not recommend it to anyone. The American version is awesome and RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Office - The Complete First Series DVD,"If you have already seen the series on BBC America then no introduction is neccessary. If not then all you need to know that this is modern day british classic comedy at its finest. If youve ever worked in an office then you will know just how real and cringe worthy David Brent is as the Slough branch boss - In his words he's a 'chilled out entertainer' but in everyone elses he's a grade one fool! Support comes from his spindly sidekick Gareth Keenan who says he's in the Territorial Army. One of the hightlights is at the in house training day where David takes over, goes home to get his guitar and plays an impromptu gig for the office...It has to be seen to be believed! Ricky Gervais is a one man Monty Python. This show is a one off."
5,Better than the original!,"I find it interesting that so many people think the BBC version is funnier. It's rather hard to root for a copy over the original, but I think this American version really is better done.The BBC version really is the David Brent show, with the other characters not getting much focus or development. This version actually has other characters you're interested in and sympathetic with. The humor is both more subtle and less focused on crude sex jokes than the british version."
3,The Office Season 1,""" The Office Season 1 "" I haven't watched all of season 1 of this series. So far I think it something to watch when I don't have something else to watch.Maybe I'll watch the rest later and like it better when I see more of it. I don't know if I should recommend it to anyone."
5,love it,i can not get enough of the office. it is so funny and they got the humor spot on. keep it up. props
3,Almost painful to watch,Interesting to see where the American version came from. Some of the exact same jokes are used. The odd thing about the possible lay-offs is that they bring in two temp workers. Why would they do that? It makes no sense. Perhaps that is the point.Features a 'How I made the Office' doumentary which provides some insights and a little paper program to explain who everybody is which is helpful.Also some deleted scenes that were mostly just unwatchable. Pointless. I wondered if they were just made-up to appear like they were deleted.
4,If only it was longer!,"The first season of The Office does not disappoint, except in its length. Not having paid attention closely, I was surprised to find that it was only six episodes. That aside, the six episodes were all extremely entertaining. Steve Carrell is ingenious as Michael Scott, the regional manager with absolutely no class. He really shines in ""Diversity Day."" Also, as someone who started watching The Office during the second season, it was nice to be able to come back and see how everything began. This was definitely a worthwhile purchase!"
2,Pining for Slough...,"The writing talents of Stephen Merchant & Ricky Gervais, and the acting talents of Mackenzie Crook, Gervais et al are sorely missed in this disappointingly humourless American version of 'The Office'. For anyone who hasn't seen the original, it may be worth a look. For fans of the BBC version, best to avoid. Miscast, and with characters that are not as endearing, this series has struggled to find its feet since episode one. Steve Carell is a charismatic comedy actor, but he overplays his role terribly. When Gervais and Merchant remade their pilot episode, they chose to drop some of the more obvious and hammy gags they originally scripted and filmed, noting that ""this was the sitcom we promised we'd never make."" Unfortunately, someone else now has."
1,British version isn't any funnier than American version,"I really wanted the British version to be funny, but it's not. It's as bad as the American version."
1,But why?,"The British mockumentary The Office was a fantastically executed television show. Granted it took a few episodes to figure out, but on repeated viewing you realise that the concept was brilliant from the get go. The remake seems a pointless exercise when there is nothing to improve in the original. More than that, the complexity of the characters is lost in the remake. The original - Brent is a horrible boss, however there is a part of you that wants him to do well. The remake - the boss is unkind and that is it. So when it comes to this remake of an instant classic, you are left asking ""But Why?"""
1,"If you liked The Office on BBC, then this ISN'T your cup of tea!",I LOVED The Office on BBC and Ricky's new show Extras is hilarious. The remake of The Office on NBC is NOT! I don't enjoy anything about it and it should not have tried to copy the original as much! It seems like a bad impersonation of what we know The Office as!
2,Office season 1,"disappointed that it was dvd only, no program insert or episode listing...just a dvd in original case. But I did order a used one...buyer beware."
3,The office,"Adapted from the original series ""The Office"" as set in Slough, England, written and staring Ricky Gevais as the office manager. This is the American version, which upon first viewing made cringe worthy viewing after having intially watched the original English counterpart.However, afer watching several episodes the unique location and style of Ricky Gevais's comedy shines through and the programme is as compelling as the original."
3,Why?,"Difficult to watch. My question is ""Why if there is going to be lay-offs are they bring in TWO temp workers?"" It makes no sense. Perhaps that is the point."
2,Don' waste your money!,"Like other reviewers I found this show to be hard to understand because of the accents. I am very intelligent college grad, executive, however, the dialect, the humor, the jokes are all a real miss. I was not pleased to have invested time in this series. The only real redeeming fact was that it does have a typical ""office"" setting with typical ""office"" employees without typical ""office"" days. Get this from the library if you really want to see it. Don't waste your money!"
5,Why Can't American TV Be This Good?,"Those of us who are lucky enough to receive BBC America need no introduction to this brilliant ""mockumentary."" If you enjoyed ""This Is Spinal Tap, ""Waiting for Guffman,"" and ""Best in Show,"" this program will delight you. Please check this original out BEFORE the Americanized version (which is in the works) hits our shores. Ricky Gervais has created a classic character in David Brent, the office manager from hell. Gervais took a page from John Cleese's book and called it quits after two series (the Brit equivalent of American television seasons) so that the quality of the work would not deteriorate: What we are left with is a diamond of a series."
5,Temporary Genius,"The Office is to sitcoms what The Sopranos has been to television dramas: a redefinition of the genre, and one that makes all others in their category seem second rate by comparison.Ricky Gervais has perfectly captured the absurdities of office life and filled his characters with real personality. Only a few are less than three dimensional--Chris Finch and Lee come to mind--but the rest are all human. Tim is a witty but wimpy lonely heart, Gareth an arrogant but vulnerable pain in the rear, Dawn a needy user--even David Brent, the manager/standup comedian who rumbles from one awkward conversation to the next, has enough humanity that you can feel sorry for him in all but his most asinine moments.The first season of The Office was the greatest inaugural season in sitcom history.Get it while you can, though: episodes of the second season aired on the BBC have been more angry and cruel--and less funny--and Ricky Gervais has said from the start there will be no third season."
4,Office season 1,"We love the show- so we had to start our season collection.Too short, though...we wanted more. Guess it's on to season 2!"
5,The best TV has to offer!,"Incredibly funny stuff!! Well written and acted. Every episode will give you a laugh, often a rolling off the couch laugh."
3,"Great show, bad DVD collection","I use the term ""collection"" loosely. It's a single disc with 6 episodes of the Office encompassing the entire first season. This in and of itself would not be bad, except that we are charged as if it was a multi-disc set. For the price, you're not getting much.That said, the show itself represents the best comedy on TV today, and easily outpaces its British counterpart. Smart, well written, and well casted.All in all, though, if you're not a stickler for having every season of a show (like I am), you are getting a lot more bang for your buck with season two."
4,Must Watch Television,"For any one who enjoys real, biting, and intelligent humor, this is a must watch show.The first season is only 6 episodes, but once you watch this season, you will be hooked forever.Not only does the show present the wittiest humor on television, but there are also significant plot lines to follow as the season develops. My wife, at first, enjoyed the romantic sub-plot between Pam and Jim, and now she is as hooked on the show as I am.Whether you enjoy sarcastic, sardonic humor or just great television, this DVD and indeed the entire Office Series is a must buy."
5,Terrific show,This is such a funny show. The humor makes you cringe but laugh out loud at the same time. A thoughtful interpretation of modern office life with unforgettable characters.
5,Hysterical,Laugh after laugh when you watch any one of these episodes of the Office...often funnier everytime you watch it.
4,The Office,I have first saw the British version several years ago and liked it. I was pleased to see the US Office and enjooy it as much. The only thing that I wish would be that I could fully understand British accents.
3,Cannot Understand,"I am hard of hearing and although I use hearing aids and/or headphones, I do not understand people with English accents. Wish, wish for closed captioning."
5,just magic,"It's rare that you watch a show that has you gasping with embarassment and watching through your fingers, yet unable to look away - this is a ""reality"" show set in a suburban British office outside London, with a smarmy boss, David Brent, who wants to be everybody's mate, and is constantly showing off for the ever-present camera. In addition to this train-wreck of a boss there's his side-kick/suckup Gareth, likeable loser Tim and his silent crush Dawn, awful Chris Finch the sales rep, and a host of other bit characters. The episode with the quiz night is hysterical, as is the training session one...oh what am I saying they are all great. And the DVD comes with a Wernham-Hogg weekly newsletter, ably penned by Brent himself. This guy is a comic genius, just dead-on in his portrayal of working in a Dilbert-like office. Hurry up and release Season 2 on DVD please!!!"
1,The Office: Lost In Translation,"I had never seen the original British version of ""The Office,"" so I decided to check it out after being unimpressed with the American redo. If I were Steve Carell's manager and agent, I would make sure he doesn't follow up his triumph in ""The 40 Year Old Version"" by playing Maxwell Smart in a movie. Do something original so you don't suffer by comparison, and boy does the American version of ""The Office"" suffer. I can see why it's bombed in the ratings and it will fail again when it returns in the fall. It seems more interested in being clever than funny with hamfisted performances and self satisfied writing that probably makes the cast and crew laugh, but not audiences. While not as bad as the American attempts to do ""Fawlty Towers,"" this is still a failure. Once it's cancelled, Steve Carell will go onto, if not bigger, better things."
1,Unlikeable Show With Unlikeable Lead,"I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman but his character in The Office is so unlikeable and unbelievable that the show just doesn't work. Instead of being funny, it's uncomfortable to watch Carrell's Michael Scott in action. I've got to think it's a writing problem because Carrell is a pretty talented guy, but he can't quite pull off making the creepy and offensive Michael a believable boss. It's painfully obvious what he's going to do and how he's going to offend everyone, so there's no joy or levity in the awkward moments. Carrell and the cast struggle valiantly, but the show just can't overcome the unlikeable situations and people. It's hard to follow a legendary performace as Carrell tries here (and apparently will try again as Maxwell Smart) and this is another remake that should have remained on the shelf."
3,my review,The episodes were funny. However it would have been better if there was more than just three. If I had known I would have bought season 2 instead. Thanks
5,Great customer service,"I did not receive the item I purchased so I notified the seller. He immediately refunded my money and I am very grateful! The DVD must have got lost in the mail or something, but I appreciate that he processed the refund right away. Thanks!"
2,Dryer than dry,"If you are expecting Steve Carell with an English accent, then don't watch the British version of the Office. This original version of the Office is very stressful to watch, and I don't recommend it."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!! Duplicate DVD's in package.,"The package is supposed to have 2 DVD's, the episodes onone dvd and commentary on another one. It seems that a wholebunch of them have nothing but two copies of the commentarydvds. Unless you enjoy watching episodes with the directortalking all over it, stay away from this DVD."
5,Give it a chance!,"Yes, everyone here is comparing this to the British version of The Office (a great show). I was horrified to hear the US was going to copy it. I was curious and watched the first episode and wasn't crazy about it. I almost gave up but kept watching. The show really grows on you. DO NOT compare this to the British version! They look the same on the surface, but the shows are totally differnet. Its so refreshing to see an original show like this on TV. I've actually laughed so hard I cried. The best part is that the 2nd season is even better. Don't forget, Seinfeld and Friends were BOTH nothing shows their first season. Give it a chance...and try not to compare it to the British version."
4,FUNNY STUFF,"Id give it five stars if there were a couple more episodes on the discs. GREAT SHOW though-- hillarious, unique, and just a good time. Id get it again if I lost it...haha."
3,Some funny moments,"I did not see this on TV, so got the DVD and prepared to see just how well this compares to the UK version.Well, it is pretty good. Some very good jokes. The ""Diversity Day"" episode is my fav one, since that is SO much like an office env in the US."
2,"office, season one","Ok, I love the office and I know season one only has 6 episodes... BUT, this particular season arrived to me in the mail in a crappy package, and the DVD had dust and dirt on it (the actual disc). It works, but I was highly disappointed that the dvd case was warped, the disc was filthy, and it looked almost like a pirated copy had been sent to me!Despite these facts, at least the DVD worked. I am simply disappointed in the sender, ""Direct Buy Video""."
3,A so-so beginning to a later good series,"I didn't watch this until after Season 2 which is probably good because I didn't think Season was great. It was funny to watch, but really only because I knew the characters already."
3,"Great show, misleading DVD","I'm not knocking the show itself, it's hilarious and has excellent re-watchability. I'd highly recomend both the US and British versions (I like the British version because the accents make me chuckle). Also, I REALLY like that it's not full of models like most shows have. You could actually see this cast of people working at an office and it wouldn't seem like a Victoria's Sectret photo shoot was taking place.My issue is with the DVD itself. The DVD states that the length is 200 minutes (give or take). Time for a little math. There are 6 shows, each show runs 20 minutes, 30 seconds. I'm not math genius, but 20.5 minutes x 6 episodes = 123 minutes, well off the 200 minutes they note. Seems a bit misleading.In summation: great show, great season, misleading DVD. Just beware of that when you buy it."
4,Great 'Office' Reference,"I wasn't a loyal Office viewer until Season 2. So, a lot of 'oh, that's what that means' or 'that's what they're talking about' questions were answered on the Season One DVD (ie: how Jim met Katie, why Micheal wears the Drakkar Noir knockoff).I most enjoyed seeing the transformation of Ryan's opinion of Michael. 'Pliot' Ryan clearly thinks Michael is sort of cool, to 'Hot Girl' where Michael is the jerk who made Ryan clean out his car.Comparing the two seasons the second in my opinion is stil far superior. But, this DVD is great for any Office fan's collection."
5,Extremely funny!,"I love ""The Office!"" It's so hillarious. I can't wait until season two comes out, and season three is suspose to be a FULL season...YAY! Anyway, it's an awesome DVD, I highly recommend it!"
5,I've watched this DVD over and over,It's wonderful! The first season of this show was short (6 episodes) but each one is a delight. The bonus material (additional scenes) plays like an episode on its own. I can't wait for this season to come out!
5,Better than expected,"I saw all of The Office's except this one. So I ordered this one thinking, ""ok, I guess I will buy this since I have not seen it."" I'm so glad I did! I LOVE the first season. Sure, it's only 6 episodes (and No Bloopers) however, the episodes are all really just as funny as the later seasons. They are great, and I'm happy!"
5,"Good, But short!",The only comedy series I will watch.But only six episodes for $20! I was so disappointed.
5,"well written episodes, original...","you can blast the show as much as you want but it will still remain one of the funniest most addictive shows on television. the characters are so close to real life it's scary, and the boss is an arrogant, no nothing jerk - like every boss. the camera play is hilarious jumping from personal interviews to punchlines, and the comic timing is dead on. here's what you can expect from the dvd...includes 5-10 minutes of deleted scenes (per episode)includes episode commentaryincludes 6 episodesepisodes are all in widescreeni never watched the bbc version so i guess i have little to say about compares and contrast, but the us version is very well done."
4,"the dritman - Sydney, Australia","This US version of the British hit of the same title has just been released on TV in Oz and seems to have the goods from initial viewing. Basically similar format to the UK version of The Office but tweaked with local US humour. Can't wait to see how a 'Seppo' (ie: 'septic tank', 'Yank') Finchy will be portrayed (prob some kind of Bud swilling smart ass gringo). Should be pretty damn funny. Good to see there are dorks on both sides of the Atlantic. There are plenty down under too believe me - LOL, I have worked in plenty of Offices amd seen em first hand. Anyway, thumbs up to this 'Office' so far !"
3,"New ""The Office"" Fan Season 1","Recently I started watching the office on T.V. At first it is hard to swallow, but a couple of espisodes in and your hooked! So I bought season 1 and thought it was pretty good. I will probably buy season 2 to continue. I travel a lot and it provides laugh out loud comedy on a repeatable basis."
2,The Office Season 1,"Watching the first season was painful as hell. There were a few funny moments, but for the most part, it was just hard to watch. The later seasons have gotten much better. So give the season some time and it becomes irresistible."
4,hilarious,"This is the one show both me and my wife agree on. A bit pricey for six episodes, but still good."
5,"Crude at times, but hilarious.","I can think of rare occasions that I have laughed as hard as I did watching this DVD. A couple of the episodes fall a little flat, but I laughed until I cried on the all the others. Fresh and funny. A nice antidote to mindless reality TV."
3,Good if you like the office,"I really liked the office when I bought this season. It was very funny, and I enjoyed it very much. The only problem that I had was that it only had a few episodes, actually less than I had expected. It's still great if you like the office."
5,One of the funniest shows I've ever seen!!,"I first saw ""The Office"" tuning in one night at mid-episode on BBC America. It was Season One, Episode Three (Tim's Birthday), and it was hilarious! After watching a couple more episodes, I decided to buy the DVD of the entire season, and what I found is one of the funniest television programs I have ever seen. Ricky Gervais does a great job of creating a repulsive character in David Brent. Mackenzie Crook is downright creepy as Gareth, Brent's chief butt-kisser. Martin Freeman is great as Tim, and Lucy Davis is lovely as Dawn. Gervais and partner Stephen Merchant have also done a stellar job writing and directing the series. Season One is an excellent collection, and Season Two is nearly as good, but that's another review..."
1,Six Episodes is Six Too Many,"I watched the first episode and was appalled that this show made it on the air. At the urging of some friends, I tried another episode and it was just as bad. When the lead character of a show is supposed to be an awful person, it takes an amazing amount of talent to keep that character from being so miserable a human being that they're watchable and even funny. John Cleese could do it in Fawlty Towers and Jennifer Saunders did it in Ab Fab, but Steve Carrell couldn't do it here. His boss is annoying and unbelievable and the rest of the cast isn't much better. Uninspired direction and painful attempts to be witty instead of funny make every minute of this show painful to watch. So funny in Anchorman, I'm now dreading to see what Carrell does as Maxwell Smart, as he seems to need to create his own characters in order to be humorous."
2,Good intentions,"The Office is a mockumentary surrounding a group of typical office workers, where their workday consists of ego clashes, inappropriate behavior, and tedium. What worked so well in the BBC program fails to translate in the American version. The awkward silences, the confessionals, and the naturalism seem artificial. Unfortunately the majority of the actors seem overly in on the joke and preoccupied with trying to recreate what made the British version flow so well, causing the show to feel unnatural and forced. The subtle blink-and-you-miss-um jokes feel all too unsubtle and sometimes over the top. The only actor who manages to rise above this and slam dunk all of the jokes is Steve Carell, the star of the show. Somehow I feel the American version of ""The Office"" is worthy of a laugh-track, and that's never a good thing."
1,Americans have completely missed the point,"Americans took the genius script of Ricky Gervais, watered it down and completely missed the point."
1,Borrrrrrrrrrrrrrring!,"It's not funny or interesting at all. I can't believe this is even out on DVD with only six terrible episodes when so many great shows aren't on DVD. Who let Steve Carrell pick this bomb for his first starring role? There's nothing redeeming at all about this series for me to even mention, as it's poorly conceived and executed. Avoid it and watch Anchorman if you want to see Carrell in a good role."
3,"Interesting, but not for everyone","British humor is not for everyone. This series can be a little boring and tedious at times, but if you are a fan of series such as Thin Blue Line, you will LOVE it."
2,I wasn't impressed,"I watched it because a friend had the DVD but I felt it painful to watch. I hate the main guy, I don't think he's realistic at all. The point of the show obviously is to satirize offices, but even in the corporate world, a manager like that would've been fired long ago. The girl/boy relationship is the best thing about it.My friend says the british version is better."
3,"Good, but without Gervais, a distant second.....","""The Office"" - US version, is worth watching as the characters are well done and have a nice comedy touch. However if you find this series funny, you really should watch the original British version of the same name. Nobody can match Gervais in the role of the Director, his timing is simply brilliant, and he makes everyone around him better in their respective roles. After you have finished the US version, do yourself a favor and get the much funnier original."
2,Strange.,"The DVD was on the wrong side of the case, and it was kinda sketchy.. I felt like I purchased something that was stolen. It has a different cover then other season one DVD;s but it had no scratches and it works."
4,Family Friendly,"Fun movie with good music and interesting characters. It is too scary for my 4 year old at points, but overall its a good family friendly movie."
5,A Delightful Tale!!,"This animated featured, directed by Don Bluth, is an unforgettable treat for the entire family. It follows the adventures of ""Fievel,"" a little boy mouse who journeys from Russia to America with his family, late in the 19th century, to seek a new life free of cat persecution. (Some analogies are present here.) During the storm boat trip, Fievel is lost at sea, and he finally washes up ashore in New York Harbor, where he vows to find his family.With the voices of Dom DeLuise, Madeline Kahn, Nehemiah Persoff, and Christopher Plummer, this story will warm your heart. A highly recommended movie!!!"
3,The mouse review of an American Tail,Great animation musical and great storyline but ok for the movie !
5,An American Tail,Great kids movie. One of my daughter's favorites as a child. Purchased for my grandkids. Shipping was excellent and timely.
3,broken case,"I am so pleased with the DVD itself. My 18 month old Son is already getting excited to watch it. And I, of course, am excited to re-live my childhood. The case was damaged in transit, hence the rating. It wasn't the outside, but rather the part where the DVD connects to the case."
1,Not worth it.,"There isn't too much more to say, as other reviewers have it covered: no widescreen, frivolous edits and additions, and a general lack of respect for a milestone in American animation (beat back Disney at the box office). It's pretty clear that the suits at Universal are unconcerned with anything more than a quick, cheap buck or two at the expense of a fine animated feature and its fans. Hold out for a proper DVD treatment, and deluge Universal with demands that they do this up right!"
2,too much inappropriate scenes,"this is way to dark for children, we stopped it about 1/4 of the way through watching it with our grandaughter."
5,NO.1,"THIS IS WHERE IT ALL STARTED!! when my first grandaughter was born she watched this alot, she even has the large ""FIVAL"" in storage,he will come out soon for a revival ,of FIVAL marathon we now have all 4 movies"
4,an american tale,i got this just because i like the storyand the voices are funnny and it is fun to watch
4,Cute!,"This was definitely one of the better animated films of the 90's, about a immigrant mouse family that comes to America for a better opportunity. While this film certainly doesn't capture the whole picture of immigration, it gives a sense of it, and what immigrants had to deal with, from trying to establish a new home, to the discrimination they often faced from natives. Overall a good film."
3,BUYER BEWARE,This is not the documentary that aired on PBS but rather interviews with the directors and the citizens of Jasper that took place in conjuction with the original airing of the program on PBS. It is an excellent companion piece to the documentary but is not the actual documentary itself so considered yourself warned.
3,ABC News,The dvd was a documentary as described but not quite what I was looking for in that I had hoped to see more of a story line..
2,Not as expected,"I think it's bad when I have to get another map out to figure out where this walk is in relationship to the area. You may or may not get the actual length of the walk. Often, the author uses estimated time. I was also looking for some of the longer walks like Dublin to Wicklow. If I could, I would return this book."
2,The Ultimate Edge Standard Diamond Sharpening Steel,"I bought this sharpening steel a few years ago, and it worked great in the beginning. It left the knife edge re-shaped but a little rough, so I used a regular steel to remove the roughness. As time went by, I noticed that the diamond cutting power was reducing and now the middle section of the ultimate edge diamond sharpening steel has little or no diamonds left on it. It will not re-shape a knife edge anymore and barely smooths the edge as well as a good regular steel. I just ordered a new diamond steel from a different manufacturer (Wusthof). Another negative is the fact the knife edge particles that are removed clog the space in between the diamond particles and must be removed on a regular basis. There are some other designs that work better I believe."
1,Works for a few times...,This product wears out fast and then does nothing. Don't waste your money. Spend a little more money and get one that will last.
5,restores knife edges quickly,"this is a tool I've been wanting for a while. I finally realized my flat stones and diamond sharpening plates wouldn't enable me to sharpen all my knives, scissors, and such. this tool does and the cost was reasonable."
3,Not bad for the price,"I work in a kitchen and use this steel everyday. I have been using it for about a year and a half and am considering replacing it now. It has worked great all this time but is starting to be unaffective at this point. Definitely worth the money, I think I paid about $25, just don't expect it to last forever under heavy use. Would probably last allot longer if it was just used in a home kitchen."
5,JAPANESE POP GROUND ZERO,"Melon's Shinjuku Blade Runner is a thrilling and diverse collection of songs by a seminal team of Japanese artists. Toshio Nakanishi and Chica Sato, veterans of the legendary New Wave group The Plastics, began recording under the name Melon in 1982. Though the project was originally conceived as a means of exploring themes beyond the palette of New Wave, in many ways Melon represented a continuation of their previous efforts. Indeed, in a few instances, the duo recycled lyrics and melodies from older Plastics songs and revived them with elements of funk and jazz.The music of Shinjuku Blade Runner is in constant flux and no single sensibility pervades. This may confuse some listeners, but as a first experience of these talented artists (not to mention the rest of the band!!!), it is a perfect introduction. Check it out! It's worth the risk!"
4,Nashville meets Dublin,"I really enjoyed the combination of Gaelic music and bluegrass. Alison Kraus' vocals on Molly Ban were spectacularly haunting. Lyle Lovett was another winner on this CD. Meanwhile, the Chieftains' playing held it all together. First rate!!"
3,Live versions at the Ryman are better,"I bought this album on the strength of Alison Krauss's beautiful version of ""Molly Bawn"" and some energetic performances of the material that I heard recorded live at Nashville's Ryman. I'd give those recordings 5 stars. Unfortunately the studio versions are too polished and don't capture the collaborative feel and spirit of the live versions.Besides Krauss, Buddy and Judy Miller and Del McCoury breath a little life into their songs. Everything else is OK but far from essential."
3,Discontinuous!,"The cd has some very entertaining songs strung together but lackscohesiveness due to the rather odd mix of songs, including instrumental numbers that are a bit heavy on the fiddle. Thelast song is exessively long and gets boring after a few minutes.Some of the collaborators stand out, such as Patty Griffin andVince Gill. The version of Tennessee Stud included does not add much however. This song has been done better by many others.Overall an entertaining cd but not one that ranks up there with some of the previous Chieftains efforts."
3,Grandfather's Memories to his Grandchild,"Haven't used yet. The hoped for Grandchild was miscarried. Will save for the future. The book was okay but who the heck remembers things from their school days, etc. Perfer a book for more writing on thoughts and hopes- more space for these is desired"
5,Great Memories for your family,This book is a great way to carry on traditions from generation to generation. Completing a book for each of our 7 grandchildren.
4,4 Great Pickers,"This album displays some of the greatest stringed instrument virtuousity in recording history. However, the album does not reflect how much better this group sounded and played live."
4,Combat a needed but only periodically needed suppliment,"I found the World of Darkness book of Combat to be a helpful book. There are times when you need a system to help define what someone can and cannot do.The system still sticks to its old adage of the Storyteller being the final arbitrator of all disputes but it gives back to the players a bit of power to define what their character can and cannot do.A few areas of improvement: I feel the book could have used an alternative set of rules for separate martial arts and the handling of a differing but combined styles. I feel that maneuvers were too expensive for what they do. Especially since anyone can do any of the maneuvers but only with a higher difficulty number.With a few minor alterations I have found it to be a most helpful book. However, the rules should not be used in every situation combat occurs. It slows the play down considerably. Billy Bossier"
4,Witty indeed,"Indeed interesting of a book. I have trained various styles, as my clan teaches them, and I have found that this book can actually improve some of the lesser known techniques, as Maka Wara and Jeet Kune Do. Nevertheless I have found that specific styles are not as deeply described as I had wished, as to say, many of the various Tae Kwon Do kicks that I find most useful in pursuing vermin like Ventrue and Lasombra, including the Dyt chagi and Ap chagi as well as the Neryo chagi, have been left out. Also, karate is described as a very basic, broad style. I find that, visiting orthodox schools, this is not true. A good supplemet for beginners, but skilled fighters can live without it.Uther Algaan, Assamite Elder"
1,The Most Worthless Book,my friends and I call this the worthless book in the World. WOD does not surround around combat. This book gives new rules for combat that aren't better than the old rules. The book goes over old rules. Personaly I don't need 50 guns listed and 15 melee weapons to play an RPG.
1,Pointless and Self-Contradictory,"Even if you're uninterested in roleplay, and are in it merely for hack and slash, this book will do nothing by detract from your game. The rules are far more complex than they are realistic or likely to allow a player to change the outcome of combat with a stroke of tactical inspiration."
2,Pedantic,"If you are new to mysteries and suspense, then perhaps you will think this is a great read. If you like space and the possibilities of space then perhaps you will think this is a great read. If you like the jargon of space and NASA then you will think this is a great read.But it is not. The writing is very simplistic. The plot is transparent early on, and thus there is no suspense. The use of flashbacks and scene chopping is maintained through a great deal of the work and makes the book a puzzle to read.The premise started well, and if the book had gone in the direction of a Crichton thriller with the use of the biochemistry arena that the jacket purports it will, then the story would have succeeded far better. In all waste your money elsewhere, Cassutt is not ready for fiction."
4,Jewish Book of Wisdom,Excellent resource for all ages helps with Bar/bat Mitzvah understanding. Book was in good condition from a closeout sale.
2,Conflicted,"I'm keeping the book, because my major concentration is Jewish Studies and so this actually seems pretty useful for a myriad of courses and studies. However, some of the stuff written kind of made me uncomfortable. Can't really pick up a page in the moment, but I didn't really expect to have that sort of reaction. I guess I was expecting something else..."
5,Great price and great memory!,"I upgraded the memory in my HP Pavillion desktop from 512MB to 1024MB using this SDRAM upgrade. The performance increase was incredible for such a small amount of money. I was actually considering buying a new PC until I realized I had an open memory slot. Althought the Edge Tech 512MB SDRAM was the cheapest one I could find on Amazon, it is working great! I'm pleased with my choice."
5,Comprehensive,"A comprehensive tutorial on Snort, the open source IDS. I especially like the author's casual, informal, tone, it feels like he is talking with you. I really liked the ""enterprise"" uses of Snort, not just on the home DSL connection.I noticed some other reviewers had problems installing MySQL. If you type in the commands exactly as they are in the book, you must the verison of MySQL used in the book, 3.23.52. This version is somewhat burried on the website. If you type these exact commands, without making use of any common sense, the latest version of MySQL the source compile will fail. As most open source applications change rapidly, I didnt find this to be a major stumbling block, and got on to the Snort content quickly."
2,Not for the security professional...,"This book is a bit out of date, dealing with issues from Snort 1.8 and RedHat 7.3. I think I glanced at it for about 1 hour total. Just put it on the bookshelf next to the Snort Intrusion Detection 2.0 book which was (if u ask me) a complete reference."
2,"Conceptual info is great, directions are bad","I agree with one of the other reviewers, Chapter 6 has more type o's than a blood bank. I am struggling currently (for the past 3 days) trying to install MySQL from source like it suggests in the book when MySQL's documentation recommends you install from RPMS..... who do you believe? I would recommend finding another book... I am going to look at the documentaton on Snort's webpage, I might have better luck there."
5,"The best book to understand the motion of the stars, earth, planets and moon!","I have purchased a few of these books for people. IMHO, this is one of the best books to help explain and show you the aparent motion of the stars and real motion of the planets and moon.I have read many books on the subject, but this one seems to explain it in a way that is easily understandable. Some sections require reading more than once! The introduction to the stars and constellations are fairly basic, but get the point across. There is a companion book called ""The Constellations"" that is geared towards a younger audience or just beginners. I enjoyed them both."
1,Astronomy,"I was looking for a good star guide. I wanted something with the history and naming origins of the major stars and perhaps a bit of science. Say, they're spectral properties, and so on. Nothing like that here. Since I didn't want to spend a lot on a book unseen, I looked for one of Amazon's great bargains in a used book. Just as well I did. This book is simply awful.Why did so many give it a 5-star rating? It's copyrighted 1952 and I doubt that there has been one bit of update. The author saw fit to illustrate the star-maps with crude handmade drawings. You've seen the type. It's basically a book for your local library's Children's Section.Anyone who has seen a very dated, and hand-drawn book dealing with astronomy will know this kind of work. Pass it up. I'm a packrat and even at that, this book is going straight into the trash. Too bad, every book should have a home, but I just wouldn't feel right offering this book to anyone, not even my local library's book donation bin."
5,Stars,My husband is a star watcher and his mother had given him this same book when he was a child. Our children loved this book too and with birthdays coming up I decided to purchase this for them. Three copies later they are all thrilled. The updated version is even better than my husband's--wonderful book!! Easy to find the constellations in book and sky.
5,Would-be Amateur Astronomers,"To date, I have given away over a dozen copies of this book. Although it was obviously written in a style easily read by grade schoolers, it is not unfitting for even the elderly! Most importantly, it stresses the idea that to become interested in astroomy, one should start with your own eyes. Do not, repeat not, think of a telescope until you find that you are truly an amateur astronomer. Most everyone has binoculars. Use them, especially in this day of severe light pollution!"
5,The Best Book for Beginner Stargazers,I can't recommend this book enough when it comes to persons just geting into Astronomy. This book lays down everything you need to know to just go out and point at the sky with knowldge. It's simplistic diagrams and it's new way to chart constellations makes this the perfect tool for anyone.
5,Making a Good Marriage Truly Great,"Although I was a bit skeptical when I first saw the book description I decided that even if it had one piece of good advice it would be worth it. (I've read alot on this subject.) Well, I'm happy to report that the book is even better than the description. The intelligent advice and deep insights have helped me focus on the incredible value of my marriage and my husband's strengths. I was especially taken with the ""Universal Light Bulb"" Theory which forced me to reevaluate my style of interpersonal communication.This isn't a superficial how-to book but a warm, friendly guide that offers unique perspectives on love and marriage."
5,Great advice and things to think about,This book has a nice variety of approaches. Give one alot to think about. Lots of information at a bargain price! Very useful.
1,Shame on you David Le Vine!,"I do not think it's fair to let one of the Authors of this book, and there other book, leave feed back here!! and of course give this a 5 star.. boo booooo...This makes me wonder how true any feedbacks are here?I'm talking about David LeVine who's name is on the cover of this book !!David LeVine this is not a professional way for you to advertize your book..Shame on you..."
1,Jams Printer,The labels jammed both our HP Desk Jet Printers! It probably are designed for a laser printer. Surprised me because Avery products are normally great
5,PROFOUND INSIGHTS ...,"...from simple observations!. What a great book I stumbled on. Buy this book. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.The author has gathered a multitude of awe-inspiring real life situations as experienced by children ( a la ""out of the mouths of babes."") These are neither too sweet nor sentimental. Instead, the vignettes evoke thoughts and imagery that resonnate easily with anyone looking for inspiration and/or a ""higher"" vantage point.Mr. Gray has apparently experienced life's viscissitudes and aims (and Succeeds!!) to share his collected insights as garnered from spontaneous youthfull inguiries and observations.Buy the book, enjoy the journey and then give it to an appreciative friend."
3,Olympics,"For the first game of this type on the Dreamcast, it is OK. The game looks good, but it is a bit tedious. It is fun to play with a group of friends, but it does get tiresome. If you really want a Track and Field type game for your Dreamcast, I would suggest that you wait. Sega and ESPN are both on their way to releasing similar games that include differing options and events. It may be wise to hold out and see which game best fits what you are looking for."
4,Fun for a while.......,"Some say this game is horrible and a waste of money. If you ask me this is a fun game to play with a friend or by yourself. The one downfall of this game is you arm gets a workout and starts to hurt after playing for a while. But everything else in the game makes it all worth it, like building up you person in each event to try and win the gold metal. I use to rent the Playstation version, that's how I first heard of this game. Then when the Dreamcast version came out I bought it as soon as I saw it. The graphics, game play, sound and basically everything else is so much better on Dreamcast. This game is fun for the first week or two when you get it, but as most games you will get bored of it. But for 20 bucks its well worth it for those two weeks."
1,"What do you think my Dreamcast controller is, a drum??!!","This game really [is not good] due to the fact that in every single solitary event you have to repeatedly press A and X. I'm not gonna break my fingers and my controller over that. The only game that's a little fun in it is kayaking, in which I was able to win. But everything else, including kayaking, was frustraing me and my hand. I couldn't even know what was going on with the cycling. The fitness excersices also [were not good] because they really didn't help you. I returned this game to the store the very next hour. ..."
3,Throwback gaming in 2000,This title from Eidos is great for all of us who grew up playing The Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics titles that used to be available for Commodore 64 and IBM compatibles. These are meant to be played with other people. You create and train athletes to your liking and then take them on a run for the gold. The amount of events you get to participate is wide ranging so if you get tired of one event you can go try another. This one is a good party game it has good overall graphics like most DC games and it has excellent voice over work by professional announcers. With the olympics on tape delay it would seem that this game may be way more entertaining than the Olympics themselves. So if you want some head to head athletic button pounding action I say try this one out. The other titles like it have less events.
3,Small,It ended up being a lot smaller than I expected. I just have not found it as useful as I hoped. It was very pretty though.
4,Very Good Collection; Minor Glitches In Kindle Edition,"I bought the Kindle edition to replace a well-read and worn-out old paperback copy. The stories are good to excellent. However, there seems to be a formatting problem with the Kindle conversion -- the copyright notice for each story is arbitrarily inserted somewhere in the story text instead of appearing in with the title and author."
5,Guarantee to split your head open !!!,"These (sic!) Swedish mofo's prove to be at the top of the death trash metal game with their best head splitting effort ""Catch 33"" I had a marvelous head and ear ache as well as a strained neck after listening and head bobbing to this metal masterpiece. I highly recommend you whip out and toss your manhole nickels and purchase this gem of metal mayhem for your head banging collection."
5,Worth buying,"Poor poor john hartley, if only he would clean the wax out of his ears he would then realize that this album is not nearly as bad as he says it is. John, ever heard of Q-tips? Well if not, then go study up on them, and then proceed to buy some whether or not you have heard of them cause they really work. Once you use them, then listen to this cd again and you will realize that you were so wrong from the beginning."
3,Swedish Death Metal,This one is great if your into heavy unyielding metal. Pansies should check out Bob Dylan or something to that nature.
2,what is this?,"I'm an old meshuggah fan, I love all their works and I only was a bit disappointed with _nothing_. But after listening to catch33 Nothing seems like a masterpiece.. Catch 33 is even worse, I don't like it. I hope they change their sound in the next release."
1,YaY,same song played over and over again.dont believe me? listen to at LEAST the first 3 tracks and close your eyes lol.
1,This album is a piece of crap,"I have been listening to heavy metal as long as I can remember. I have a very open mind when it comes to different styles of music, but I must admit that I am a bit surprised by the number of positive comments posted for this album. I think most people are a little biased, and are forming opinions based on the bands other (and much better) albums. There is absolutely nothing good to say about this album, and I certainly do not recommend purchasing it. If you must get your fix, I will sum up the entire album for you:[...]"
2,horribely overrated,"it seems the tech bands nowadays have always had a goal, to exerpiment new ideas and push there techinque aspects by playing faster and or more complicated. Catch Thirty Three.....in designs seems like so, but all this record is a repetitive over wrought death march that goes absolutely no where. The albums high points are the opcassional rythyms shifts and the offbeat time signatures that are beat to living death out of.The songwriting is awful (its a 47 minute song that couldve easily been 20), the progessive element is a fools gold joke. After hearing bands like Between the Buried and Me and Dream Theater its hard to be impressed by an album of such dull calibur."
1,Meshuggah?,"This is by far the worst album I've ever heard! The whole one song to a cd thing is very overrated. The worst thing is that the guitar riffs never seem to change. I love other Meshuggah albums, but this one is just trash. Would highly reccommend you listen to this album before you buy it, or else you'll be stuck with this one song wonder. For shame."
1,"ME""SUCK""AH","Boring, sounds like one long song. Sucks!!! Get anything by Meshuggah before ""Nothing"" and you will hear some excellent music."
5,Their Best,"Many fans (like me) will call Catch-33 the best Meshuggah CD ever. Some unfortunate fans still can't get DEI out of their CD player long enough to realize how brilliant this band has become. This is no longer a band experimenting with amazing time signatures, they have perfected a new genre and stretched themselves out to form incredible music. Take Chaosphere and blend in Sol Niger Within, and you get something like this. Metal? Sure. Jazz? Sort of. Death rock? Yep. Progressive? Definitely.This will ruin all other metal for you. It's that good."
1,avoid this trash at all costs,"Disingenuously selling itself as a clever spoof of recently popular independent movies, this film is instead a vile, sophomoric, and idiotic waste of time. The R rating is, unfortunately, a totally insufficient warning of the crud that marches across the screen from the opening scene, when the viewer, without warning, becomes witness to a male-male scene of simulated anal sex...and goes down hill from there. Obviously geared for the crude tastes of middle-school bad boys, this mess is an insult to viewers of all ages."
2,Spoofing Good Movies...,"Why is it nowadays producers find the need to spoof good movies? That's all this film does in an attempt to be funny. I was already taken back in the beginning when they started off by making fun of Pulp Fiction, one of the greatest movies ever. I'm all for making fun of Bring It On and such but leave the great films alone.What I don't understand is in order to even understand most of the films they mock, the viewer would have to be in their mid-twenties yet the humor is that of a middle-schooler. Either society is dumbing down with age or the younger are getting old way too fast. The only reason it gets two stars is in hope that whoever watches this will go out and rent the films this ""movie"" trashed on."
1,WOW -- what a load of $*%&^!,"I so wanted to like this movie and was looking forward to enjoying a good spoof parody film in the genre of SCARY MOVIE or NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE. But this film was not one tenth as funny as these examples. SM and NATM are not great films but they do make me laugh and are better than other similar films like HOTSHOTS, AIRPLANE and POLICE ACADEMY. I was expecting something within the same ball park from BIG FAT INDEPENDENT MOVIE. It's seems in theory that this premise could work. Make fun of all the independent movies of the last 10 to 15 years. But this was crap because of the lame actors and terrible script which inevitably means bad direction as well."
5,Fabulous reading for kids and adults too,"My daughter was reading these books in school, so I purchased a set for her at home since she was telling me about them and laughing long after she got home from school. I wanted to see what I was missing so I have been reading them to her at bed time. We have enjoyed The Adventures of Reddy Fox, The Adventures of Danny Meadow Mouse and The Adventures of Grandfather Frog, thus far. It is an enjoyable experience because while I am reading them for the first time, my 6 year old knows what's coming from her experience at school and she is having a great time enjoying her ""secret"". The stories are enjoyable to read even as an adult, and not the mindless clutter that so many children books are."
5,Perfect,"I recently ordered 18 boxes of this item for a convention. The badges arrived quickly, worked perfectly, the paper went through the printers with little issue, everyone got their badge, and the event was a success!One caveat that registration ran into, was that they had to staple the badges into the plastic holders, because the badges did frequently slip out. But that's not a deal-killer with us."
3,"Good product, but unadvertized shift in badge size causes need to recalculate","I bought the same product number as before in 2009 for my biennial conference, Avery 74549. When I received them this year, they had made each label, figuring from the center of the 11"" sheet, to be about 1/8"" shorter than before, but did not change the dimensions listed on the box.The badges were no longer slide-in from the side, but a different sort of plastic and slide-in from the top.I am anticipating that they will work fine--maybe even better than before, but I print custom labels for them, and I have had to recalculate everything."
4,Good item...just trouble with printing,"Overall, the badges were great - just as advertised, and the price was outstanding. They were purchased as part of a conference for around 400 people. The only caveat with the item (and this may be more of an issue with Microsoft or our printer) is that the template for the badges was off. I had to play with the margins, and size of the badges (a lot) to get them to print appropriately. A tad frustrating, but I would definitely buy them again (especially now that I have the margins figured out!!)."
3,Not bad for a beginner book,"I picked this book up when I was serious into Chiclids. It's a typical ""dummies"" book format with a lot of information crammed into one book. I recommend it if you are first looking to get started in aquariums."
4,Jack Maggs,this book is written in old english style a bit difficult to understand butnice read would recommend to anyone
4,An Excellent Read,"Peter Carey's novel gripped me from the first page to the last. Jack Maggs was to me a most sympathetic character, and his adventure a compelling one. The descriptive passages were excellent; I could see, feel and hear those dismal London streets. My only confusion with the book was that some of the characters seemed to change ""character"" as the story went along; Buckle, for instance, who started out as a sympathetic, kindly fellow, turned out a villian. And Jack's ""reception"" by the other characters seemed to be inconsistent--one minute they sympathized, the next they didn't. And what happened to Silas? Did he die in prison?Despite that, and the fact that I had to read the first chapter or so over again to get my bearings, I thought it a wonderful book, full of adventure, skullduggery, and a charming ending."
3,"Enjoyable, but less provocative than it wants to be","Certainly the lives described in this novel are full of period interest and detail. Certainly, the story is rocket propelled. And yes, there are some quite, quite moving passages. And yet the book rings somewhat hollow. The conceit of telling Maggs' story through his letters and through his sessions under the magnetic power of Tobias Oates felt clumsy. And the relationship between authors and their subjects was hardly approached with any new insights. An entertaining, if unprovocative novel."
3,Too much,Peter Carey writes quite eloquently about the 19th century. I found this book to have a great mixture of characters yet sometimes he seems to rush through others making it a little difficult to remember each character's significance. I found the first half of this book to be fantastic. It allowed the reader to feel as though s/he actually lived through such experiences. Story dragged along the end finishing with a less then satisfying ending.
1,Pointless,"I finished this book and sat wondering why I'd read it. I found the plot random, the characters confusing, some of the details suspicious. I enjoy these books that put a spin on some old classic, but this invites comparison, and this is not a good idea in this case. I think this writer was trying to show us the dark side of Dickens. Nice try, I guess. Or not. I'd go for Charles Palliser's ""The Quincunx"" for that. I ask myself why all these other people liked this book so much. I think they have low expectations."
1,"Read Great Expectations, Skip Jack Maggs","Out of the 41 online reviews thus far, only three have not recommended this book as a good read. I am proud to be the fourth. I was informed that Jack Maggs is told from the perspective of the convict Abel Magwitch (from Great Expectations). Besides the fact that Jack Maggs is a convict illegally returning to London, I recognize no Abel Magwitch in him. Furthermore, Carey's other characters are either not based or are so loosely based on Dickens' characters as not to be recognizable. Overall, Carey's plot, characterization, and dialogue are seriously lacking. I wish this book had never been associated with such a great work as Dickens' Great Expectations."
1,Finally gave up on it.,"I've been trying to read Jack Maggs for the past couple of weeks. I found myself always trying to find something else to do. This included catching up on magazines, playing Freecell on my PC, etc. Tonight I finally gave up at about the halfway point in the book. Unfortunately, I didn't really care about what happened to the characters and didn't find the story at all captivating or even interesting. I read quite a bit and it's pretty unusual for me to quit halfway through a novel. Obviously many readers loved the book, but I didn't."
4,A high-brow guilty pleasure,"I really loved this book! From the very first page, I had trouble putting it down, and hated to see it end. The writing was beautiful and vivid, which justified the time spent on what was really just a soap opera-type melodrama. Despite the Dickensian social commentary throughout the book, it ended up as more of an adventure story. My greatest disappointment was the end, which just seemed to fall apart. What happened to Henry? Plus, I didn't buy the relationship between Maggs and Mercy. But, a glimpse at the characters of Toby, Lizzie and young Jack were well worth the flaws!!!! Great read!!!!!!!"
5,A creepy ride through the not so innocent 19th C. England,"If you are familiar with Peter Carey's work, this is more similar to Oscar & Lucinda, with supressed emotions bubbling over, and a lack of gloss to everyday living.Jack Maggs tells it like it is. This is no romantic romp through the London of past, but an exploration of the darker side of life and it's struggles.I'd recommend this book to people that are interested in the story that doesn't get told; that of the dirt poor and the unremarkable. It also gives an interesting angle on Australia's convict past, and the workings of class structure. Peter Carey has written a dark and brooding book, that rings true, and recreates a world where life isn't always rosy."
3,Atmospheric melodrama satisfying read,"A melodrama suitable to the 19th century genre full of mystery, letters, coincidences, and reeking with atmosphere not to mention quite a collection of interesting Victoriana especially London minutia. With short ""chapters"" the plot moves along very nicely, thank you. Shifts in narrative voice help hold the interest and the characters are memorable. Some theoretical interest regarding ""truth"" and ""fiction"". A pretty good read."
4,A Good Solid Read,"The best thing you can say about Jack Maggs is that Peter Carrey has fashioned a darker, more realistic, more interesting Dickensian London for the reader to inhabit. Although the plot takes a long, uneventful time to get set up, the periodic flashbacks are brilliantly executed. The story told within the flashbacks of Jack Magg's brutal childhood were by far the best part of the novel for me. Carrey's descriptions of poverty, burglary, and depravity were vividly recounted to great effect. The other outstanding element is the creative portrayals for the secondary characters. Tobias Oats in particular was well fleshed out and had a life of his own. The plot is well executed and relatively complex, but not as compelling or intricate as Dicken's best or Paliser's 'The Quincunx'. The story unfolds in a somewhat flat manner and lacks the urgency one would expect. Overall, worth the read, if for no other reason than to soak up the long ago London world Carrey has painstakingly re-created."
3,Hmmmm... something missing,"Compelling but not completely satisfying. Good characterizations for the most part, but some characters, particularly Mercy, were not drawn enough to engage the reader's sympathy. Liked the ending, though. Overall good story but not filling. Read to reach the resolution but at times a little too vague for me to enjoy"
2,It ain't Dickens,"Yes, Great Expectations is obviously the inspiration, but Jack Maggs is certainly not comparable. It's a plodding book with a plot contrived to make a boring postcolonial point. The mesmerisim device fails to mesmerize, the selective details of 19th century London are sparse and unable to conjure the pictured streets Dickens so ably conveys in all their uproar and foggy familiarity, and the characters--while I suppose more psychologically ambiguous thanks to Carey's having benefitted from 20th century novel writing and all that Freudian guff--barely stick in the mind the way Dickens caricatures do. A novelist should be prepared to do justice to the chosen source material. Jack Maggs hardly does so."
1,Not universal as described!!!,"It's not universal...This so called pin lock only fits the small half inch hole on the receiver and is lightweight and cheap. The locking mech sticks out only a quarter inch or less and can be broken off in a second with any screw driver.If not for the hassle and shipping charges, I'd send it back."
5,Flawless,"If you think Costco has good bikes, do not read any further. Otherwise, if you want the best hub, you've found it."
3,Not as good as I thought,I bought these for nametags for my kindergarten students. I expected the plastic to be thicker and more durable. I doubt these will last very long with my students. I'm pretty disappointed.
1,printing up labels is a nightmare,"First, the avery on line template does not come up when you put the number in their search engine.Second, after an hour creating a label, I kept getting messages that I needed three more things (different versions of Adobe, etc.) in order to print up the badge. I called Avery's help line and they verified that fact---and the fact that they didn't have this requirement on the planning sheet.When I downloaded what I thought I needed, then I couldn't download the template. And Aavery wants to capture your e-mail and name to let you use their templates.Word and Pages won't work for this product.Soooooo---I've weasted hours on this project. Fair warning to all."
3,TEMPLATE PROBLEM,Can't say whether it was a printer problem or a template problem but I could not use these cards with my printer. I had to make up my own. Otherwise they are what I expected.
5,Christmas book,Still haven't the entire book yet but looks like an easy read and very understandable for the average reader. Story about Christmas and can't wait to finish it.
2,christmas book,I did not like this book the letters are so small. you can not see it real good. And it is all at the top. the whole page is wasted.
2,Absolute mediocrity,"Absolutely mediocre book with low-quality illustrations. However, there are some interesting short game drills described there so if someone is addicted to buying golf books this one has a right to be bought."
3,"Better than most golf books, but nothing really enlightening","I like the dummies books and I have read my share of golf instruction books. This one is alright. Nothing great and nothing lame. It does have solid instruction, but nothing novel here."
2,"Audio book, not really a video.",If you are expecting a Bible narration with nice video or still photos on the screen then this is not for you. All you get is a good quality audio reading with the words scrolling across the screen. Great for some one who does not read the English language very well or even for a read-along in a group setting like a Bible study or Sunday school. It might also be good for kids to actually see the words as they are being read.
3,Good drive but ...,"Don't bother if you're looking for a drive to make bootable, such as for a recovery method or for use to boot other OSes without wiping your main drive. This one won't even been seen as a bootable device even on computers that will work with external USB drives as a boot option."
1,False Information,"This book contains false information leading to a false premise, that we (mankind) can even change the temperature. The truth is, do the math! IPCC's own numbers, of a trillion tons of CO2 removed equals only one degree change. Well? The problem is, the whole planet burns only 30 billion tons per year. OK, for those who actually believe in this nonsense, I'll do the math for you. That's about 33 years of no, nada, and zero movement on the planet to lower one degree! Ugggggg. But buy the book if you want a good laugh."
4,Fine for what it is,"Needed it for physics lab, worked well enough. I like the hard(ish) covers. The graph lines were perfect, dark enough to make out, but light enough to not obscure what you've written."
4,learning about reliability and good stewardship,"Pooh is asked to watch Christopher Robins' favorite toys and, through some mishaps, learns what it means to treat the belongings of others with as much as care as you would your own. Makes for nice discussion with kids and neat for bedtime."
4,Who can have the blues,"This is fun romp through New Orleans with the Blues (Kathleen Turner and Denis Quaid) is one of the funniest movies with plenty of twists and turns. It's loaded with plenty of stars, Stanley Tucci, Fiona Shaw, Tom Arnold and more. It's a nice movie to sit and enjoy with popcorn and the family. It's a nice bit of mindless fluff that allows you to just sit and enjoy a film without a strain. It's a good film to watch to relieve the stress of a hard day."
4,Just for fun,This is a laugh-out-loud fun movie for the family. It's set in New Orleans pre-Katrina and it reflects the flavor of the city.
1,"sent the wrong format, twice!",The format of this DVD was designed for non US DVD players. I ordered this twice and got the wrong one twice.
4,"""Muerte' means DEATH!""","A very funny movie. The review title refers to the character played by Stanley Tucci who, I believe , was the hit of the movie. I laughed my butt off @ every scene he's in. Not to say the rest of the movie sucked. It was very funny. It's just that Tucci was great. I'm laughing on the inside as I compose this review!"
1,this stinks,i would have liked to know that it would not play on my dvdplayer i did not order region two under cover blues and now i am stuck with a dvd that i cannot watch and i am very pissed off about it
5,Undercover Blues,"I purchased ""Undercover Blues"", featuring Kathleen Turner, Dennis Quaid and Stanley Tucci from Amazon. Itis an entertaining slapstick spy comedy. If you hate slapstick humor - no matter how funny you probably won't like this. However, if you enjoy cleverly done slapstick you will enjoy Stanley Tucci's characterization of the incredibly inept ""Muerte."" It portrays a husband and wife CIA team - Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid - enjoying a vacation with their baby daughter in New Orleans. The dialogue is clever. The action sequences are well thought out and choreographed. ""Muerte's obsession with getting his revenge on the Quaid - Turner characters simply displays his increasing ineptitude and frustration. In this movie the ""good guys"" win."
4,Great 80's-esque movie,"This movie has great shots of New Orleans, which initially drew me to it. It's a bit dated now, but still a very funny comedy with some great lines. Truly enjoyed watching it again. Highly recommend."
5,Movie was underrated,This is a fun and enjoyable movie. I watch it over and over again. A must have for a home movie collection.
4,Muerte not Morty,"I saw this on TV a few years back.Thought, the running joke ofMuerte(ie Death) and Morty quite hilarious.The story itself is far fetched but then so are all the James Bond movies etc.Alsoin view of the catastrophic event In New Orleans(which I visitedabout ten years ago)the storyline taking place there gives youthe chance to relive travel experiences.The story is about two undercover, married spies with a new babyto take care of.They encounter all sorts of dangers etc in thecourse of the storyline with the fairy tale end result.Try ityou will enjoy the film.The four stars only rating is due to the credibility of the story not the film itself."
4,Undercover Blues,"A very good film. When ordering the DVD it stated that it could only be watched on DVD players that can play zone 1 films/DVD's, so naturally I was somewhat skeptical in ordering this movie. Will it play on my player?, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this was not an issue. The movie was that much more enjoyable knowing that I could play it as much as I wanted too on my DVD player.Thank you Amazon!"
5,good movie,This is a sweet movie. Caught the last half of the movie on tv one night and it was so cute that I had to buy it. now I get to watch the WHOLE thing! :)
5,True Blue Comedy!!,"This is a great comedy for any audience. The lack of profanity in the film (unlike many more recent films) makes it one of the best non-animated family films of all in my book. In my opinion, Fine has no sense of humor. My only disappointment is that it has not been released on DVD."
4,Great movie,"Easy watching flick. Not Turners greatest work. She seems very wooden at times. The running gag with Stanley Tucci is great. ""My name is death. Don't you forget that scum hawks!"" Tom Arnold is funny as the midwest dork. Watch for a bit part by Dave Chapplle as Ozzie the thief. Very enjoyable."
4,Very Funny!,Hilarious movie. Plenty of site gags. Stanley Tucci is incredible. Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid make the perfect spy couple. Really enjoyed this one!
5,"This Little Movie is Good, Clean Fun","I have seen this movie serveral times. Since I could no longer find it as a rental, I bought it to have something to watch with my teenage grandkids. It is not Disney-esque. It's good clean fun with an adventure plot set in New Orleans; there are cops & undercover agents. There are good guys & bad guys. What's not to like? Stanley Tucci is wonderful as ""Muerte/(Death)"" or... as they call him ""Morty"". This is one of those little movies like ""My Counsin Vinny"" that I can watch over & over -- it provides some fun."
4,Supporting Cast Adds Spark,"There are enough laughs to make this worth seeing. There are enough odd characters, too. That's no surprise when you see the supporting cast: Stanley Tucci, Larry Miller, Fiona Shaw and Tom Arnold. All of them put added spark to the film.Tucci, as ""Meurte,"" is most obvious as he continually tries to mug the leading couple, played by Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid. Miller plays a weird cop with a lisp and a very weird accent. I guess you could call this movie ""quirky.""Turner and Quaid are so smug as modern-day Nick and Nora Charles, you want to root for ""Muerte"" to succeed. Frankly, I never found Turner, except perhaps in ""Body Heat,"" to be that alluring. However, I think she is an underrated comedienne.As a whole, this comedy is a little rough in spots, hence the PG-13 rating which often means more profanity than R-rated films. This is not for the kiddies, but adults will laugh."
3,A movie that seemed to have a script,"UNDERCOVER BLUES was a movie that seemed to have a script; flawed script as it was. I bought this movie to watch the likes of Bacalique Kathleen Turner and that movie star, Quaid. I saw them--with a baby to tend-- try to stage a spy-comedy story, but strangely the outcome reminded me of 101 Dalmations. REALLY! Lucky for an audience was this comic character, Stanley Tucci, who stole the show. Otherwise, Turner and Quaid--CIA Undercover--were too, too suave for spy characters. Their James Bond quip comedy lines just didn't work. Here is another movie that couldn't make up its' mind: is it a comedy, drama, suspense, mystery, n'importe quoi kind of story. Nevertheless, for all of its' flaws, UNDERCOVER moves along and keeps your attention. You are going to laugh somewhere along the line. And keep your eye out for Cruella. She's there with her sort of funny bad guys."
5,GOOD MOVIE!,"Ok , First off I never listen to those big critics in the newspapers anyways , and its a good things I didn't or I would of missed renting one of the funniest movies ! Its good fun , witha good plot and the actors and characters play off each other greatly! before I saw this movie I thought it would be borin but after I saw it I absolutely had to buy it and put in my personal collection.Its also a great family movie ,I aint got a family myself but when watchin a kid sister, I put this movie on and she is rollin on the floor laughin! I highly recommend this movie ,at least give it a chance you wont be dissapointed!"
4,Soooooooooo smart and funny!,"Don't heed Marshall Fine's review of Undercover Blues; he's wrong! This movie such a hidden gem it's sick! I'm a reasonably savvy moviergoer and I know what I likes. And I likes this movie. I've never been a huge Dennis Quaid fan but I gotta admit, he rocked in this film. Stanley Tucci is absolutely hilarious in his ridiculous and somewhat loveable badguy role. Kathleen Turner is also excellent, as is the perennially funny Larry Miller (I love that dude!). Honestly, rent or even buy this movie. Good for kids AND adults, and smart in a subtle manner. A truly good comedy that curiously slipped through the cracks."
4,Undercover Blues is the spy spoof side splitter of the year.,"Here it is...a James Bond 'knock-off' rip-roaring, tongue tickling, spy spoofing, movie ...and if you can say that without tripping, then this is a must see movie. Like Tango & Cash, Turner & Quaid find themselves a once again rehired CIA spy duo out to save the 'World'. Along the way, they run into a scene stealing 'El Fuento' co-star. Grab the popcorn for this one."
3,"Well, this is a pleasant surprise!","I don't know if the anonymous viewers from Milwaukee, Boston and Orem, UT will ever come back here and see this message, but if you guys do-- I *wrote* UNDERCOVER BLUES, and reading what you had to say about it absolutely made my day. I just wish I liked it as much as you did. (The original script was better than the final film.)"
5,Wow. Moved me to tears and helped to remind me of how good I have it.,"I read this book in two days and loved it. Yes, it's a story of a medical drama that happened to someone, but it is the furthest thing from depressing. This is the very real story of the author's experience of having and recovering from a stroke, but hers was a journey armed with humor, pluck and true grit. The book moves at an incredibly fast pace and I didn't want to put it down. Julia tells her gut-wrenching story with humor and aplomb - you find yourself cheering for her literally each step of the way and wanting to kick the pants of some of the medical professionals that crossed her path. She is living, WALKING proof that your attitude is everything and her experience has something to teach all of us about never giving up and appreciating all the little things that we so naturally take for granted. Highly recommended."
4,Good Book Discussion Book,"""Don't Leave Me This Way"" is a fast read that centers on how the medical community deals with patients. Our book club had a great discussion about this book and its focus. Ms. Garrison's strength dealing with her situation is amazing. It certainly would be good for anyone in the medical field to read it. It has a great list at the back for patients to help them deal with a medical situation. The book club all felt it was well worth reading and I have found myself recommending it to several friends."
5,"Humbling, entertaining, educational!","I have been in the health care field for 20 years, thought I had it down.This book had me riveted- so well written, humerous, touching.It showed me a new dimension I had been missing, and am so happy to have as I move forward with family, friends and clients who will continue to face challenges and rely on their grit, faith, and professionals in their pursuit of recovery.You will be so happy you read this book!"
5,I am not much of a reader,I am not much of a reader but this book was suggested to me. I could not put it down. A smart brave woman who kept her wits about her in the most adverse of situations. I so admire her ability to push forward and then write about her experiences. BRAVO Julia!
5,Don't Leave me This Way,"An eerily honest reflection of my own life and frustrations living with brain injury. Well-written, nice use of language, great black humor. I've never read a book written in the 2nd person, strange at first, but it works (especially since her experience *has* happened to me.) Important information for health care providers--could they please figure out some better way to provide care when people are completely bed-bound because of paralysis? The ""getting to the bathroom"" issue is so difficult--Julia's anger and frustration mirrors my own.A wonderful reminder of helpful ways to approach a person with disabilities--great specific suggestions, ways to help ease awkward situations when young children ask uncomfortable questions in front of a stranger."
5,Don't Leave Me This Way,"I love the open, honest, humor that Julia Fox Garrison lays bare in this wonderful story of courage, hope and faith to overcome the ravages of a stroke that changed her young life forever more. A must read for anyone who has had a stroke and the caretakers who help mend them,or anyone else who just needs to suck it up and do their best to be their best."
5,A Valuable Story For All of Us,"Julia Fox Garrison's is an engaging, enjoyable, and quick read ... certainly all good reasons to pick it up and read it.Yet, this book is much more than a good story. I view it as a gentle, clear, and inspiring reminder of how important it is to take time to enjoy and be thankful for the many blessings in one's life.While certainly this book discusses challenges of stemming from medical issues, I feel that Julia's message of how challenges can help us see the world in a new and better light, can be applied universally. I particularly enjoyed reading about how these challenges helped Julia become more sensitive others and helped her grow spiritually.Don't Leave Me This Way adds a lot of positive energy in helping us deal with problems both individually and collectively."
5,Awesome,"Its Amazing and very heart felt - Couldn't stop reading it but I didn't want to finish it either !! Ha I am very happy I purchased this , it has made a difference in me ."
5,A Must Read - Highly Inspirational,"I loved this book. Though Julia has a reason to be bitter,she is anything but. Her spirit, humor, family and positiveattitude support her as she soldiers on. It is a lesson forus all.As an aside, make sure you don't have any medications withPHENYLPROPANOLAMINE in your cabinet. It got taken off themarket in 2005."
5,Don't Leave Me This Way,I loved every minute of this book. It is a motivational book that every patient and care giver should read! I have a Mom with MS and after reading this book it made me realize that I do have to push more and fight more for her rights. The health of a patient is not just physical but mental too. The spirit is the most precious gift of all and the one that goes unnutured in our health system. I wish every health care provider would read this book!
5,Just what we need,"Julia's ability to laugh at herself in spite of the devastation to her brain and body shows us that life goes on better with some humor. Positive attitude=positive outcome. As a stroke survivor I can appreciate everything she has gone through. I find myself reading passages to my husband and both getting a good laugh, as he has gone through it all with me. I have shared this with my therapists so they can recommend it to other stroke survivors. Stroke rehab is long and frustrating. This has improved my disposition better than any antidepressant could."
3,"Good effort, poor remastering.","This was the first compilation I bought on Ruth Copeland containing most of the contents of her only 2 albums on Invictus Records. This cd has been re-mastered from phonograph records instead of the real master tapes. The listener will hear the pops and crackles of the needle in the groove. To add insult to injury, they omitted one of the best performances by Ruth Copeland, ""Madame Butterfly"". This is inexcusable."
4,Ruth where have you gone off to ?,"Well ruth was an artist who was close to the Parliafunkadeliment thang in the early days-She lent her voice and songwriting skills on Osmium so george returned the favor and produced her 2 solo lp's also for P-funk lovers Original funkadelic plays on here so if you wanna hear another side of Eddie Hazel,Billy bass, Tiki, Tawl Ross, Ron Bykowski, and bernie worrell get this you won't be dissappointed."
2,"Invictus fans, beware","This is without a doubt the most disappointing reissue I've bought in recent memory. I love the music I've heard on the Invictus label; addictively catchy post-Motown soul from Holland-Dozier-Holland and their great stable of artists. But Ruth Copeland? She is nothing more than a dreadful hippy-chick who warbles and screetches over some truly awful material. There are a handful of good tracks here: the excellent ""The Music Box"" (until she starts her crying jag in the middle!) and of course the gem ""The Silent Boatman."" But ""I Got a Thing for you Daddy"" is as horrid at the title implies, and the world does not need more half-rate covers of ""Play with Fire"" and ""Gimme Shelter."" Not even some wicked Eddie Hazel guitar playing can save this mess of an album (actually two albums on one disc). If you are an Invictus fan, stay way clear of this one."
1,no wonder I never heard of her!,"After seeing a DJ in a Garage dance party holding up her album, I did some research, and it sounded intriguing: the songwriting team of Holland/Dozier/Holland (the best and most successful Motown writers, along with Smokey Robinson) started a record label after Motown. They signed her, so she must be good, right? Ugh.Her voice is - on a raw level - very good. But her DELIVERY, the SONGS (which she has joint or sole credits for, save the cover songs), the PRODUCTION (which she did), and even the ARTWORK (which she also did) is GOD AWFUL. I've never skipped the majority of so many songs on any CD. This holds true for both ""albums"" contained in the collection.In short, except for possible collector's interest, this CD would best be used as a coaster or Frisbee."
5,Great CD!,"Probably one of their best albums! I have been jamming to this cd non stop since I got it. I had the cd once before but friends kept asking to borrow it and I eventually lost it and I can understand why. Every song jams and its my go to cd when I'm driving to work. Yes, I know that VHS or Beta has come out with other CD's however this is one of my favorite and I imagine if you pick it up, it will be yours too!"
1,Awful ambient disco tripe,"I just saw this band opening for another band in NYC, and it was more sad than anything else. The ""funk"" name for the album is a lie; this is a straight disco band. They occasionally did get a funky groove going, but didn't know what to do with it other than make it louder and add kitchy keyboard effects. It was like listening to the instrumental tracks from an exploitation movie, and not a good one.And to the reviewer who said that the band defied categorization...only if you didn't live through the 1970's. To the rest of us, it's just disco. And not even good disco."
1,oversimplified neither complex nor catchy,the mood of this record to me is depressing as opposed to driving and uplifting. there aren't any hooks. it just takes up aural space like muzak. i really don't see an upside to this band except that it may garner numerous daft punk comparisons. this is what daft punk would've sounded like pre-homework when they were still ironing out their sound. of course we all know the disappointment which became of daft punk post HOMEWORK which makes listening to these guys all the more depressing. luckily i received this album as a promo and i didn't have to pay for it. I own the ALbum HOmework by Daft Punk on vinyl and it was worth every cent. this rubbish isn;t even worth my review. SO please do yourself a favor and get Homework by daft punk before i have to waste my time typing more.
1,The downfall of music with meaning....,"Okay - let's stare at 5 potsies trying to make an exibition out of the fact that they spend years of their life trying to perform ""live"" what a Roland drum machine can do by itself - at least if they let the machine do it live, they could hang up some posters of some attractive women, or something more interesting to look at than their bad fashion sense."
3,Follow-up to amazing 'Windsong' falls a bit short,"Windsong, Denver's huge-selling 1975 recording, was such a glorious string-drenched trip through the mountains that I instantly knew it would be my all-time favourite Denver recording. And I was right. Spirit is a nice try at a follow-up, especially with songs like The Wings That Fly Us Home (the first time you hear it, you'll have a tear in your eye) and Come And Let Me Look In Your Eyes. But there's also a lot of stuff that seems so...so pedestrian, like It Makes Me Giggle and Baby You Look Good To Me Tonight. A better album, in my humble opinion, is 1977's I Want To Live."
3,It's okay ... but not the best,"I was hoping for more of the same really beautiful songs by John Denver, but this one was disappointing. One of the reasons, as I found out, was that many of the song were written by other song writers, and not John, himself; and these were not the best of picks. Just my take of it all."
3,Nice album showcasing his voice,John Denver'c voice shines here and is one of joy and fun...bringing the Rockies to the public and making them wish to be in nature.
4,Spirit ranks as one of his top performances.,"If you like country, pop, rock, and easy listening, then this c.d. is for you."
2,Don't bother,These toys are very poorly made and the parts fall off immediately. Don't bother with them.
5,very good book,"This is one of the best TOEFL books available.The grammar section is so strong that youcan build up your grammar skills very easily.Lots of explanations and lots of examples.Very, very, very good book."
2,Audio in English Screen Titles in Spanish,"This is a great price for one time viewing. I decided to show this to my children's class at church. BUT i hate that the screen titles are all in Spanish. It must have been a dvd setting that wasn't changed before uploading to amazon. However, the audio is in English and it is a very well done, exciting animated film."
1,Poor music,"This is bad. I mean real bad. He does have a good song or two but that would be pushing it. He sounds like a man who was run over by a dump truck. The production for the cd is actually really good, but now I'm just saerching for something positive."
3,Great product but the Avery software is quite challenging!,"We made name tags for a high school reunion using the team mascot and a simple border. The card stock is good quality so the final results were great, however, we could not figure out how to save the template so it took a lot longer to develop the final product than it should have. We received lots of compliments on the name tags and some requests to share the template. Avery could really capture customers if they enabled customers to save the template on their computers."
4,Good product,These badges were perfect for conference hostess committee. Easy to work with; excellent results from computer using names and photo.
3,Great badges but bad software,"The badges are great and just what I needed to do the job I had in mind. However, the software provided free by Avery is primitive and not very user friendly. I will have to run them twice; first to get the logo and signage on and then run a personalized group of each name and photo. This software does not make it easy to save. I will be searching for more appropriate and useable software for the name insert."
2,Worked OK... for a week,Igniter stopped working after 1 wk. Drips a lot. Does not 'grab' new glue stick until previous stick is gone. Not a very big melt reservoir.
1,ignighter,Item appeared used and igniter did not work upon receipt.There was actually a glue stick already loaded. Contacted the manu and they said that was unusual.
4,Hanging Name Badges,Being a conference registration person and having to make up name badge the cost was most important to me. While looking for the product Amazon had the name badges at a cost that was way more reasonable then if I went to the store to purchase the same item. I am very grateful for Amazon assistance in helping me afford the product at a time when cost is everything...!
4,Good Produce @ a Great Price,This is a good product at a great price. I saved about 1/3 over buying this at Office Depot.
5,"Practical, stylish, popular w our club members","Everyone in the club likes not having to use a pin-badge or clip-badge. The hang-badges are the easiest, and doesn't harm the shirt/blouse. We use the Avery program (free) as the software. I am computer savy, but not an expert. The program to set up and use a database of the club members, can be a bit intimating for the new user, but hang with it, and you can figure out how they think. Hope this helps."
3,printable name badges,"These name badges were excellent quality and reasonably priced. They were easy to use with the Avery wizard. The only complaint I have is the limited templates available to use by Avery. I was trying to place a photo and name on each name badge. I was able to use one of the templates, but the print for the event was very small. And that was using the largest font and size available. I would have preferred a blank template to use. I did appreciate that this item was available on Amazon for a much lower price than in local retail stores."
4,Good scope,I used it the other day and it was very easy to sight in. This is a great scope for the price.
2,Don't get too excited too soon...stick with using this on a .22,"UPDATE: 12/5/12****Don't buy the scope! Originally I was shooting my 30/30 at 1"" groups at 100 yards, BUT now the picture is blurred after a dozen rifle fires. Basically if you want to put this on a .22, go ahead but don't try it on bigger rifles.I was very skeptical about this scope (especially because of the price and that I was mounting it on my 30/30 which kicks like a mule). Lets just say after 20 shots of soft points and some patience with the scope adjustments I was shooting 1"" groups at 100 yards. I physically cannot shoot better than that so this scope is a diamond in the rough for me.I do want to mention that after I adjusted the scope to make ready the first shot the picture was very clear. I took the first shot and looked through the scope to find that the image was blurry. I didn't panic. I readjusted the focal lense, got it back to a clear picture and never had that problem again...that was easy break-in to me."
3,for $50 this thing is sweet,"I didn't know what to expect for $50, but i saw good reviews. So far it holds zero after running (3) 5-round groupings through it. That's not ""combat grade"" but I'm a hunter, not a Z-Day fanatic, so it's good for me. The clarity is amazing, and it works in tandem with my night vision scope (I had to move it forward on the picatinny rail to mount the night vision behind it).You will need to order raised mounting loops for it because the 50mm lens is HUGE compared to a 40mm. I used the 1"" riser type on my picatinny rail. Works great.J"
5,"Excellent, easy-to-follow instructions that really work!","If you're a beginning cartoonist, an expert, or just someone who loves Art (in cartoon form), you'll get a lot from The Cartoonist's Workbook.The drawing instructions are straight forward and easy to follow. The ""keyhole"" method is especially useful for creating figures. The budding cartoonist, or grizzled Art veteran, will quickly find themselves drawing figures that express emotion and movement. There are also useful sections on the methods behind ""gag"" writing and the selling of your own cartoons.If you like to draw, you'll love the Cartoonist's Workbook, and your cartooning will definitely improve!"
3,handy tips,"I purchased this book as the ""cartoonist must have"". After reading it, I saw myself as an experienced cartoonist (I know I am, but that's nice to conclude) who's developed his own style to draw, but still there are pointers and alternate ways to look at things (to create a gag), and that's what makes this book a well spent dollar (or two, three or more). Any cartoonist cannot develop his own style without looking at the Masters, and this book will give you an insight in a Master, no less."
1,Buy this only if you absolutely can't draw,"I was disappointed with this book. It is absolutely at the most basic level of drawing. I have a bachelors degree in fine art. I already know how to draw. The book should come with a disclaimer like "" Great book for those who can't draw stick figures. Great book for children."" I don't think this book will help people who are serious about becoming cartoonists."
5,Terrific book - worth it's weight in Goldie Hawn!,"Most books on cartooning show you how to copy the AUTHOR'S cartoon style, which in my opinion is a pretty pointless exercise. The Cartoonist' s Workbook is very different. It gives you the means to develop your OWNunique style and there are even thousands of drawings of useful poses and gag situations that you can easily adapt after you have found that style. But the BEST part is the chapter on writing gags. Hall gives the reader a'complete method' for writing gags for spot cartoons AND cartoon strips, and it REALLY works. I thought twice about recommending this book because I wondered should I keep it all for myself. I also recently purchased Hall's new book Cartoonists' And Illustrators' Trade Secrets and was equally impressed - it is absolutely PACKED with invaluable advice. I reckon these two books are all you really need to make it as a cartoonist. Thank you Mr Hall!"
2,Rehash of the Wheel of Time,"An excellent, well written book that contains absolutely nothing new. All of it's content is found in the previous books, and the only possible reason for it's publication is to make money by pretending it has new material."
1,Can You Spell: RIP-OFF?!!,"If you can, then retitle this book as the biggest money grabbing RIP OFF i have ever come across. I have been anxiously waiting for closure to TEN THICK NOVELS i have lived with, dreamt with and toiled with the characters within. Is the end of this series on the horizon??? Can't tell for sure since the author is too busy repackaging in small bites a cash grab from his once loyal fans. I understand he may be hoping to pull in the ages 9-12 youth readers, but why not FINISH THE SERIES first!!!Please Goggle his fan page or website and LET HIM KNOW you are NOT WELL PLEASED.Signed, Horribly Disappointed"
4,none,"The Horror Movie Survival Guide is a must have read for horror buffs, and those just needing to hone up on their monsters. This indispensible guide is insightful, fact-filled, and chalked with campy humor, just like those schlocky B movies we all know and love. A handy reference guide for ridding yourself of monsters the right way. Shelve this one between Dr Spock's Baby Care Guide and Miss Manners Fine Etiquette... Gary S. Potter Author/Poet."
2,Not funny or clever,"I tried but this book was boring beyond belief. The ""humor"" fell flat in most places and the way the monsters were set up was scattered and shoddy.I was expecting more. It's just not funny."
2,meh,this book takes it self to serious. it reads like a middle school english text book. the only reason i would recomend it is if you are writeing a horror movie and you want to keep it true to the genera.
2,not a good quality,you can see some sticky things building upon on the ceramic area and it takes a lot of effort even for my very thin hair..and when I used my friend's chi straightener I could really see how a straightener supposed to work.. I would never buy this again
3,artists' referrence photos.,A good basic physical pose referrence book for the beginner. Nothing special and not particularly well thought out but it could be useful to spark the imagination or when physical referrence is needed.
2,Livin' It Up! With the Bratz,"This is not a movie as much as it is an inter-active Dvd. It was fun for my 8 year old, but a little more difficult for the younger ones. If your girls a Bratz fans they will love it."
5,Livin' It Up! With the Bratz,"This Bratz video is much better than the other one we purchased, My grand children love this one much more so than the styling video."
3,Okay....,"I LOVE the Bratz, and have all their movies and love them, but this one was a disapointment. The animation was poor compared to the other Bratz movies, when they moved, they seemed week and lifeless; the voices could have been better too. Also, it was more of a movies then a game."
1,$.84 per minute of video - not worth the price,"I did not look closely at the run time for this video - 15 minutes, that is it. It did not even include the entire 60 minutes episode. You can get the same information for free on YouTube. This DVD was not worth the price or information."
4,A very insightful person,"Some of the veiws of HRH came along way before they gained ""popularity"". I don't think he gets enough credit for his insightfulness."
1,Arrogance at it's best,"This DVD just proves the total arrogance of this man. He's spoiled rotten and he doesn't try to hide it. He and ""Crocodile Camilla"" deserve each other"
2,"Lots of words,","I purchased four guidebooks for Ecuador to study before my three month sojourn into the country. I ranked this book third as it was difficult to get both the depth of information for a particular place ... or get past the less than logical organization of the material. Admittedly, it is a question of style, but I found it hard to use."
3,"Becareful, It Breaks Easy!!","Becareful. The ""SCISSORHANDS"" are so fragile, it breaks easy. There's a small part that broke right away when iI touched it. Also the thing on the left leg will snap if u roll the figure too hard..I also dont like the paint on the face."
5,Edward Scissorhands figure,"All fans of the movie ""Edward Scissorhands"" as well as admirer of Johnny Depp would love this item. I have seen many ornaments, toys and action figures of Jack Sparrow, but none have done very well in capturing the character's or Johnny's facial features or body characteristics as well as this one! It is truly Edward! All of the minute details (scars, buckles, etc) hair, leather suit, scissorhands, and other implements (down to the knife in his boot) are there. The figure also comes with a standup background with mini poster from the movie which really adds to the mood of the piece. Due to the intricate and fragility, it would not be recommended for children or for hard play. It is truly a display item. But if you love the movie or the actor, this is a must have!"
5,Everyone loves my Namaste cupcakes!,"I am so happy to have these cupcakes! They are moist, delicious, not too sweet and are perfect when paired with Pamela's chocolate frosting. Actually, I often have requests to bring them to parties. I agree that you do have to cook them longer than indicated on the package, but it's well worth it.For my daughter's birthday parties I make these, with Pamela's frosting (I don't like Pamela's cakes) and I get an all ice cream cake from Baskin Robins. That way she gets her cupcakes but she also gets a cake that looks like all of the cakes she sees at other birthdays, too!"
5,OMG...Yummie.,"Got a case on a huge deal...haven't had chocolate cake for 3 years. Very chocolately, moist, full of flavor. I will definately buy more. Would pay the full price for this cake mix. Totally worth it. Won't be disappointed."
1,Bad even for 'healthy',"I had high hopes for this, but it was bad. Really bad. The whole pan of cupcakes made from this had to be thrown out. Very gritty and dense."
3,fair,these looked very nice and seemed easy to install but did not fit my 95 accord. i beleive they were intended for the previous generation; being 93 or prior. seller was quick to respond and allow to return item.
1,Appalling...,"Mr Cross's novel inflicts on the reader a dreary litany of scenes in which people dress, eat, watch TV, smoke, drink wine or beer and utter the blandest of banalities of which the following quotation is quite representative: ""People are freaked out by a train crash, which is a rare occurrence and unlikely to happen again any time soon. More people die every day on British roads than die annually on the railways. But rail crashes are newsworthy. After a crash, nervous passengers take to the roads. The roads are a great deal more dangerous than railways. And the more congested the roads are, the more dangerous they are. Simple really.""One example of the many enlightening passages in this novel..."
5,Oldie but Goodie,"I bought this after a very long search ...and because of one song (My Dearest Esmerelda). I'd had the cassette many years ago and wore it out. Now that I have the CD, I remember how many other great songs there are on the ""album."" I'm a big fan of Denver's older stuff and this is a great purchase."
5,The standard for professional desktop bookmaking,"Adobe Framemaker is the industry standard for professional desktop bookmaking. Widely used by technical writers in the computer industry, Framemaker is the only desktop publishing software that can handle the production and publication of 1,000+ page books. (MS Word usually falls apart at around 300 pages.) Framemaker has fully enabled style mark-up, indexing, and cross-referencing features, as well as being the only word processing package on the market _designed_ to be coupled with Adobe Acrobat to create active, fully cross-linked PDFs.No professional writer should be without it."
3,Decent for the price....,"I received the red brushes as another poster mentioned. They are NOT selling the higher quality blue models any longer apparently. However, I still feel that this is a fair deal, since the quality of these brushes is still superior to the base brushes you can get from the various home project stores. Still, it would have been nice to receive what they are advertising, instead of the lower quality versions in red (MIC)."
2,Boiling water destroys the active ingredient,"Boiling water destroys the active ingredients called kavalactones.I found the tea pleasant, but did not notice any of the calming effects described on the box.I googled kava root and found several articles describing how the active ingredient is destroyed with hot water.I am currently waiting on my cup of hot water to cool down to room temperate to try again. I figured I would try it this way instead of throwing away the box and buying the kava root and making my own the way described in the articles."
3,Not as good as it used to be.,"When I first used this product a few years ago it worked really well and I really could feel the effects of it but just within the last year I got some more thinking it'd do the same but I think they've changed the formula. The tea it's self doesn't taste as strong as it did when I had it a few years ago and I feel virtually nothing from it now, just a little drowsy, if I drink a lot of it before sleeping I'll wake up extremely thirsty as if I had drank alcohol. I've heard people complain about the taste but it never tasted all that bad to me, I actually enjoy it."
3,Kava,"I love this tea, it tastes earthy, I did not know it had stevia in it after I bought it. and read the reviews. I am still kinda weird about stevia. but it did knock me out, I have been having problems sleeping and my leg muscles leg muscles have been super tense and achy, I had a glass of wine with dinner and later the tea, I went to bed and slept hard, a few weird dreams though. I also woke up with a hang over, I drink wine every night, but I guess not a good combo with the tea. either way. I got some sleep."
5,Love this tea,love this tea and it is a very good deal. I'd say by it an you won't go wrong! If you want the best deal I found it is here
4,Great relaxation,"I drank 2-3 cups of this on a few different occasions and I can say that to me it was really nice. I have insomnia problems so I don't think it put me to sleep as fast as it did some other I have let try this, but it's a great product and I really enjoy it. The people who have tried explained they have had some of the best sleep so I am a fan and will be purchasing more. It also came with six individual boxes which was more than I expected. They say that right on the advertising but it seemed like a great quantity for the price as well. Thanks again amazon"
4,Nice to unwind with!,"A good choice to add with an additional tea such as Valerian, Chamomile, Passionflower...etc. The tea is nowhere as potent to using whole root Kava, but is a good, low-cost alternative to pricey Kava Root. I usually mix it with another tea called: Tazo Calm, and get nice results!"
5,mmmm.....kava,this particular brand has a combination of herbs that make for a sweet and spicy tea. i love kava and the relaxing effects i feel. i am ordering more now.
2,Vivid Dreams and Concerns of Liver Damage Caused Me to Stop Using.,"This tea did help me to relax however, it caused me to have vivid, sometimes disturbing images/dreams. After looking up the side effects on webmd.com, I also read the precautionary statements about potential damage to liver (even after very short term use) and decided the risks and side effects do not outweigh the benefits. I will drink Chamomile instead... :)"
3,Sleepytime Tea with One Major Drawback.,"I happen to love the effects of this tea. I am an insomniac and all my medicine without my sleeping pill cannot help me sleep. This with my meds (sans sleeping pill) will allow me to sleep-- which is great. The flavor is sweet and mild, however even in the 2nd sip of tea it produces this weird numb, tingling sensation. It's very bothersome to me. I'm assuming that is telling me the Kava is working, which is why I keep downing the cup-- however it stops me from enjoying it too much.However, I'm keeping it around for when I'm having trouble sleeping, run out of sleeping pills, or have a really rough day/bad pain (I also have chronic pain, and it seems to relax me a bit, which helps.)Since most people don't even note this in their reviews, I'm probably just extra sensitive to this effect."
2,Not loving it so much,"I am a tea lover. I drink atleast 3/4 cups of Yogi, Tazo or other brands of tea during the work day. I specifically love yogi tea...I bought a packet of this particular pack over a month ago and I actually do not care for the taste of it. It almost has a rotten, bitter taste to it although there is a sweet liquorish top taste to it. It almost tastes a bit pungent and I actually have a hard time drinking it. I feel this need to not waste money so I am trying to finish out the box and I wish that I did not have to. So I give it a 2 star. It's just not my cup of tea."
4,Nice after increasing the dosage,"This is a good product (good quality Kava root - no stems or leaves - and nice tasting), but you have to use at least 2 tea bags to get the feeling you would get from traditional Kava (relaxing and elated feeling). As far as convenience goes this is an easy way to get Kava but the increased number of bags used factors into the cost."
4,Pregnancy?,"I really like the flavor of this, but does anyone know if this truly is not safe in pregnancy or just a disclaimer they have to put?"
5,good stuff,"Great tea! Just like most all of the Yogi tea. Has a sweet flavor, very mild. We like to trade this off with the Calming blend too."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be,"First of all, make sure you really like the taste of licorice. The licorice flavor is very strong in this, easily overpowering everything else. I could barely choke down a cup. Also, Stevia has an after taste to me. Always has, and this was no exception. Admittedly, I was hoping with all the other herbs--i.e. cinnamon and ginger amongst others--in here, those two flavors would be overpowered. I was wrong. Did this product work after I forced it down my throat? No! What worked was the two capsules I took of kava kava liquid phyto-caps from Gaia Herbs. I'll also be trying their liquid extract--in a cup of chai latte tea I make myself."
2,not the best tasting,"I drink all types of teas, but this is one of the worst tasting teas, in my opinion."
1,Be Careful,"Please be careful, I did not read the product description so I do not know if they mentioned this but, kava can cause SEVERE LIVER TOXICITY, even without prior liver damage, please consult your physician before taking this or any other supplement!Thanks"
2,"Good tea, but kava content is quite low.","If you are just looking for a tea, the flavor is nice, but each bag contains only 20mg of kavalactones, which makes this a very economically unsound source of kavalactones, the stress-relieving chemicals in kava. I have tried this using 4 bags, and the effect was negligible. You may have better luck with this product than I did, but just don't have high hopes of the effect being akin to that of traditionally prepared kava or quality kava extract like Gaia kava."
5,Favorite Hot Tea,never liked hot tea before I tried this one...now I am hooked and I have a couple of mugs of hot tea a day!
5,THIS HAS TO BE THE MOST MOVING AND STOMPING SONG OF STACIE!,"I COULD BE THE ONE, delivers a clear a good message to anyone who really listen to it, the fresh beat and the clever lyrics makes this another feel good track from miss Orrico. I COULD BE THE ONE is one of those track that are easy to like hopefully it would be release in America pretty soon."
2,60 Minutes DVD - Echo Boomers,I ordered 11 copies and a few of them we were unable to view. The quality of the DVD is not that great!!
4,Something to howl about,"I greatly enjoyed this novel. I had a smile on my face the whole time. With each chapter, the laughs kept coming. For all those women who are trying to figure out your pedigree, this is the perfect book."
5,Sherlock Holmes Radio Mysteries,"I thoroughly enjoyed these series of stories. I love the radio plays style of ""old time radio"". It brings the story to life. I strongly recommend this to anyone who loves Sherlock Holmes. In addition, the manufacturer, TOPICS Entertainment, fully stands behind their products. Furthermore, they are one of the few responsible companies that I've run across. They donate 5% of their pre-tax profits to educational and environmental groups. That alone should encourage everyone to do business with this fine outfit. Buy this and you'll not regret it."
4,It was better than I expected.,"I am an old Melanie fan, so when I saw she had a Christmas CD, I decided to check it out. The CD is very good. Better than expected. I let my brother listen to it (not a big Melanie fan) and he liked it as well."
2,Great Sunday Movie,"This movie was not at all what I expected it to be. I guess with being a fan of Spartacus and other movies depicting this era, I expected more! However, if your just lounging around on a sunday with nothing else to do...why not pop it in and watch it!"
4,IT'S MISSING SOMETHING BUT STILL WORTH A LOOK,"Set in Roman Egypt during the late years of the Roman Empire and partially based on real History this film has some very interesting scenes but then it also has some that fail to hit the mark. The cinematography is awesome but the story tries to do so much and on such a complex topic that it would have been better served as a miniseries than a historical picture. That said, it's worth a look, especially for History buffs. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minusUNDERTAKING ATTEMPT: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: December 2010; MY GRADE: B minus to B."
5,Well Mounted Historical Drama,The film received good review by New York Times.I saw the film last night and was greatly touchedby the historical background which remains relevanttill today.Why do mankind take religions into his/her own handto satisfy his/her own greed?In the name of religion slaughtered hundreds and thousandsof human if not millions.
4,Movie,There are some scenes that are not for young audiences but I liked the movie. It if fairly accurate however some things have been changed in an effort to be more entertaining.
4,"Intersting subject, so-so movie","The story of Hypatia, which is the subject of this film, is little-known, but oh-so-relevant for modern Western culture. Everyone should know of her story. While I have always been enthralled by Rachel Weisz beauty, bearing and style, this is not one of the best made film vehicles for her. It seems to hover on the edge of camp, unfortunately, and never rises to the gravitas that the story and characters demand.Nonethless, it was not horrible or unwatchable, simply a mediocre film about a VERY important historical character and story. It echoes ominously in these times."
2,Just couldn't get into it,"I'm a pretty big fan of movies set in ancient history as well as ones that revolve around politics, science, and religion but I could not, for the life of me, get into this movie. I got so bored I ended up stopping it before it was over. I feel like the acting just wasn't filled with enough emotion."
2,Pitiful,"Two stars because it looks so good. If you want to see contemporary campus opinion on religion dressed up in ancient garb, this is the film for you. An epic set in ancient Egypt turns out to be nothing more than a diatribe against Christianity. No wonder the film did poorly in Europe and worse in the US.It bombed because it's not good."
2,Lame film-making & bogus history,"I don't mind films taking some liberties with history if it improves the story - Kapur's Elizabeth is a good example. Timelines are greatly compressed, Robert Dudley (Earl of Leicester) is turned into a naive pretty boy (which he was not) and it's spiced up with some dramatic episodes that didn't happen (like Walsingham murdering Mary of Guise). But the story, cinematography, and portrayal of life in the Elizabethan court (especially the politics) are absorbing and completely credible.Agora lost me when the young woman protagonist used a proposition of Euclid to ""prove"" that ""we are all brothers"". To a viewer who knows something about the history of science and philosophy, that was the last straw. But the plodding narrative style and series of two-dimensional characters spouting cliches already had me reaching for the Stop button."
5,Excellent!,Great period epic cinematics and insight to the historic conflicts of different factions and free inquiry. Sad that it's corporate censorship highlights how these conflicts exist today.
3,Bit Confusing,"Although the cinematography was very good and mesmerizing, the story line was confusing. I felt like there was a lot missing that I should inherently know. It was as if the movie was intended for audiences that already knew their history of that time period. It's a shame that this is the case because the Alexandria library held volumes of information that was lost forever. I don't think this point came across in the movie."
4,Filling some gaps in history.,"I particularly enjoy historical/period pieces movies so wanted to see Agora, even tho some reviews were not good. I liked the movie(DVD) and thought the costumes and sets were great. I learned more about a real-life person and a period of history in Alexandria.While a bit campy at time, if you enjoy history movies, you will like this."
3,Good movie,It was interesting about the fall of the empire but I probably need to watch it again to be certain of licenses taken. Am not certain of the historical accuracy.
2,Another Hollywood Travesty,"St Cyril as a brutal misogynistic thug? Only fans of pseudohistorian Charles Freeman's books will enjoy this latest jab at orthodox Christianity from Hollywood.Historically and aethetically inaccurate to the max. Not to mention dull, with blahzay acting throughout."
1,A great dissapointment,"There is not much to say about this movie. Rachel Weisz lent her talent to a movie that her acting could not hope to save. The plot, predictable dialogue, and message are dumb ed down to the point of insult to the viewer. The ""historical"" setting is sloppily anachronistic. Instead of being the edgy, controversial film that exposes Christianity's less-than-holy rise to power in the complex society it developed in, Agora is a slide show of charicatured Christians and pagans. Setting aside the movies goals and style- it is painfully bad and nauseatingly boring. Spare yourself."
2,dissappointed,"I came to this film after reading promo reviews of two highly respected Aussie critics, who described it as visually stunning. It was not!!! The premise was poor. Ignorant religious bigots destroy books and knowledge, and lives. Gee, nothing revealing in that. This movie was a waste of time and money. You could argue that it depicted the superpower as the real villain, but you wouldn't convince me it did it well. I mean, what superpower would manipulate religious morons for its own political ends...?? Yes of course, all of them."
3,What was the plot really???,"The movie was good, but I felt like it didn't really go anywhere...like we wait the entire movie for this big hurrah that never shows."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I do not recommend you waste your time watching this. It is horribly slow, and not very interesting. The characters are only partially developed, at a very superficial level. I think they are trying to create a film like the 10 Commandments, but fall so short that the entire film is a waste.I watched it because it seemed like it got such high ratings. I find it hard to believe anyone enjoyed this film."
3,plot fuzzy,The staging and costumes great. But the plot and focus got fuzzy. I couldn't really pick up on the focus of what the movie really wanted to say.
4,"Brilliant acting, impressive atmosphere, horrible transitions","While the acting and stories were wonderfully done, the periodic shifts to space with text explanations were both disruptive and hokey, to say the least. I kept thinking of Space Odyssey every time it happened and wondered where the monolith was. They ruined what was otherwise an impeccable film. You could really see and feel the different perspectives of each character."
1,"Poorly written, not worth your time","Here's the story of an athlete who hasn't the necessary skills to become an American hero; all the athletic ability that money can buy without the personality traits that make him either heroic or, for that matter, even an anti-hero. The book is badly written by a guy who uses pseudo-competent interviews and notes gained from questionable sources in telling you why you should either hate this person, or why it's your fault that he is the way he is. The writer is a moron, don't waste your time on this trash. If sports literature is your thing, read Friday Night Lights. If you must read about this subject, stick with Game of Shadows."
3,Barry Bonds,"I thought this would be a good book for a teen to read, however, there was much too much foul language."
2,an ax to grind?,"Sounds like to me this 'author"" has a personal vendetta against Mr Bonds. It felt like I was reading a tabloid. While he certainly is entitled to write a book that doesn't mean he should. And to top it off he never once talked Bonds himself."
5,Just finished it,It was a good book and provided a lot of good information. It is a bit of a sad story since despite all the talent and money he had he really never seemed happy
5,Excellent insight into Barry Bonds,Excellent book. Very entertaining. If you are a baseball fan this is a must have as it talks of Bonds throughout his baseball career. There are many quotes from his teammates on the Pirates and the Giants as well as items from his college days.The book talks about his marriages and his relationship with his dad.I finished this book in a week when it usually takes me a month or so to finish a book. I could not put it down.
5,My kids LOVE this!,My kids really love this project. Make sure and get enough paint on your picture and don't let it stick to itself when taking on plastic sheet. Would highly recommend it.
4,bdavis,My daughter received this as a birthday gift and enjoys making the window art. It's easy enough to use w/ one caveat: You can only make one project at a time (if you want outlines that are on different pages) without disassembling the the book and it takes about 24 hours for the project to dry.
5,rewarding and fun,"My daughters are 8 and 10 and they have thoroughly enjoyed the Christmas version of Window Art. You simply place the provided clear plastic sleeve over one of their adorable designs. Then trace the design with the paint the kit provides which comes in small, easy to hold bottles with narrow tips for drawing finer lines. Fill in the designs with any of the six bright colors. Then let it dry for 24 hours and it's well worth the wait. Peel the design off the plastic sleeve(they peel off easily) and place on a window(they cling perfectly and can be removed and replaced). Our windows are covered in cute and impressive little figures and designs. I'm impessed with the ease and results."
3,Window art,"Although it is fun, the jars are small and it is geared towards Girls. Not much for boys. Would like to see boy stuff pictures and a way to get more color stuff."
2,Item returned,Order was placed for my 4-year old grandson; contents were not as shown on the box and not at all suitable for a child. Vendor was very understanding about the return and I have been notified that a credit has been issued. Am totally satisfied with the service and have a greater understanding of how these items are sized.
4,"If you like Lonesome Dove, you should like this one!!","We loved Lonesome Dove. When we watched Return, we were really impressed...it's got different people than the first one but they do a great job. We truly enjoyed it!!!Recommend to any Jon Voight fans. He does a great job."
5,true love,true love n every sense and naturally being a squel to lonsome dove it has to be watched with lonesome dove
4,Return to Lonesome Dove [VHS],"This VHS tape was used but watchable, skipped in some spots. Service was quick and all was as described."
2,On of the great westens,"Good production but this one gets contrieved and appears as you expect a sequal to sell air time. Not a bad story but has soo much to live up it disappoints. jon Voight is not a believable character and appears week compared to Mr, Tommy Lee.They could have left this one in the hopper to work out better casting and revised story."
3,review,"this wasn't so bad-- but once you have seen the orginal itis just another western type movie, I did enjoy it"
1,Return to Lonesome Dove,"Return To Lonesome Dove is a crime. It uses the Lonesome Dove brand to swindle people out of good money. It is the politically correct version of Lonesome Dove. It is everything that Lonesome Dove is not. Trite , silly, farcical, ignorant, unrealistic, boring, poorly written, bad casting, and uninspiring. The original Lonesome Dove is a masterpiece, but Return to Lonesome Dove is just a piece of...Comanche Moon, the prequel to Lonesome Dove, is good and worth a watch before you decide to buy it or not. If you're a Lonesome Dove fan, you'll be inclined to enjoy Comanche Moon and see everyone 30 or so years earlier when they were Texas Rangers and they expected respect from a bartender. Now FORGET about Return to Lonesome Dove."
4,"Good, but not as good as the original","""Return to Lonesome Dove"" was pretty good, but not as good as the original, ""Lonesome Dove"". The characters were charming, the acting was good, and the story was decent, but this title is missing the feel of the first movie/series. The character depth and interaction was just better in the original. I do not think ""Return to Lonesome Dove"" did a good job endearing the characters to the viewer especially if you did not see ""Lonesome Dove"". Despite this, this movie/series is still a good watch, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,return for more profits is more like it,"this is by the numbers film making,and as such has no place in the lonesome dove story. with few of the origanl cast back it falls to other actors to take up the parts ,and yes jon voight is a good actor but he can't hold a candle to tommy lee jones and his turn as call. all in all this one misses the mark!!!!"
1,horrible acting,if you saw the first lonesome dove then you dont need to see the second. the acting and script are done very poorly. maybe if they could have used the same actors they could have saved the poor story line.
1,Rent It First!!,"A dismal disappointment. I think you should rent it and find out for yourself before you actually own a copy. When I see the high ratings, I wonder if people have some investment in the selling of this product. The original Lonesome Dove mini series was unbelievably well done. A complete multifaceted joy. I was so excited when I saw there was a sequel and the joy of Lonesome Dove would continue. Well it didn't and you can read why in more depth in other low ratings."
1,You Can't Go Home Again,"I knew Woodrow Call, and Jon Voight is no Woodrow Call. Voight is less than nothing. Return to Lonesome Dove is less than nothing, but perhaps I'm being unfair since I bailed after the first abysmal hour.The only element of interest from that first hour was Oliver Reed's Donnegan, and only because of the wraith in Donnegan's improbable Montana mansion. The wraith is Awbonnie, a native servant who flits through a few frames with Elle Woods-Witherspoon. Donnegan is probably a hack Hollywood stand-in for Granville Stuart, Montana's grand old man, who married a Shoshone woman named Awbonnie. One of their dusky daughters married another grand old man of Montana, Teddy Blue Abbot, cowpuncher and best bud of Charlie Russell.Donnegan's attempt to comingle Elle & Mr. Newt suggests to me that Elle is not Donnegan's wife, as advertised, and that Awbonnie is. If anyone anywhere gritted through the next four preposterous hours of Return, let me know if I'm right."
4,SNOWBOUND DELIGHT!,"The first time i saw this movie,was during our 1997 snowstorm.Watching it together with our family, and a warm,lovely fire from our fireplace made it all the more special.A must see for any family."
4,Return to Lonesome Dove,The acting was very good as well as the story line. The site selection for the movie was wonderful and beautiful.
3,Revisionist History Dampens The Screenplay!,"The first scene of the movie consists of a young woman shooting up Gus's marker. It turns out that Gus mistakenly got her mother killed in a shootout in Mexico, when he (Gus) was involved? with her mother. The plot has some good points in that the cowboys are Mexican ""Vacqueros"", but the producer takes great pains to show that the Vacqueros are better than the American cowboys. I won't try to describe the whole plot, but will say this film does not ""fit"" well with the other ""Lonesome Dove"" films because it twists most of Larry McMurtry's views into ""modern, politically correct, viewpoints"". Having said all that, I would still reccommend the movie as it does have some good action and plot lines."
4,Enjoyable,This movie was very good. Not as good as Lonesome Dove but mainly because the actors were not the same ones. I would recommend this movie.
2,Alternative universe/lonesome dove,"Completely copies the story lines in the original Lonesome Dove movie. A rather dull original after seeing the original. All the character action and dialogue seems robotic and not spontaneous as in the original.Let's see, in the original, Captain Call had the first cattle drive to Montana and the Indians were still ar war. In this one the year after they arrive in Montana, the territory is largely settled and full of large ranches. Come on!Watch it to see an alternative Lonesome Dove vision, but it is only mildly entertaining. Best bet, watch this one first, then the others. It will be less disappointing."
3,It was an ok movie......,"This movie would have been lots better with the ORIGINAL cast from the first Lonesome Dove. Don't get me wrong, Jon Voight was good, but Tommy Lee Jones made the part happen for the series !!! Some of the parts could have gone and made the movie lots more interesting, but all in all, it was good I guess !! If you liked Lonesome Dove, you would probably like this one ."
2,Following the Impossible,"I will admit that it would have been very hard to follow the original Lonesome Dove as a sequel. But to try and do it with mostly all new actors and with a script written by a different person is practicaly impossible. This movie would have been a fine western had it been released first or on its own. But as a follow up to Lonesome Dove it does not cut the mustard. Jon Voight is a fine actor but his portrayal of Cpt. Woodrow F. Call is not on par with Tommy Lee Jones's. With Gus (Robert Duvall) gone the banter and friendship between the two, part of the initial movies appeal, is also gone. So many of the original characters are gone and much of the feeling was lost.This movie is decent but the original was a hard act to follow."
4,Great Sequel,"This is a pretty good sequel to the original movie. I believe that this movie was missing one key thing. Tommy Lee Jones. The transition between the actors was not very good. Tommy Lee played a more calm, less talking, and less emotional character than Jon Voight. Rick Schroder did very well in this sequel."
3,not as good as the original,transaction went well. The movie is not as good as the original. Sequels usually arent though.
1,UNPLAYABLE,I was not aware that I would not be able to play this movie on a dvd player when I ordered and paid for it this was a big! waste of my money.
4,tna global impact japan,tna global impact japan is an outstanding dvd. not only do you get to see some of tna top stars but some of new japan top stars. the matches i felt were pretty solid. with the highlight being kurt angle's main event. in the end if you're a true wrestling fan you will enjoy it.
2,Not worth the money,"This book gives only the most basic of overviews for what you need to know for the real GMAT exam. Additionally, the math questions have many, many typos (for instance, they use a '+' instead of an '=' in the question), so it is impossible to know how to answer the questions. I didn't bother carefully reviewing the verbal section, because I was so disappointed with the math. I would recommend this book, only if you need additional practice math problems, and typos don't drive you crazy. I highly recommend the actual book from ETS and Kaplan books (the other 2 I used) for studying for this exam. (Also Elements of Style by Strunk and White may also be useful to you.)"
2,Skip it,"While this book covers many of the same strategies as other books, it is nowhere close to being as complete or as challenging. It also contained several typos. Your time is much better spent with the Kaplan book and CD and GMAC's official prep books- skip this one."
1,More harm than good,"I bought this book in preparation for the GMAT exam. While the tips on how to solve some of the quantitative problems are valuable, they can be found in other books. The serious problem with this book is that the practice problems in both the verbal and quantitative sections have numerous errors. You will not learn anything from this book and it causes more harm than good. I returned it to the store (not bought from Amazon) shortly after purchase. You'll do better off sticking with the Kaplan guides or the GMAT Official Guide"
2,Doomed plot,The Author did very well when you consider this is a book that is based on a screenplay that is based on a video game. Buy the book to support the author but if you have other books you like save your money and either buy it used or get it from the library.
5,THIS IS THE BEST NOFX CD EVER,Maximum Rock & Roll is the best ever produced be NOFX. It is the fastest and the best kind of punk music there. If you are into old school NOFX then this CD is for you. If you like the new stuff with El Hefe on the band then by this CD anyways. If I could I would give it 6 stars
2,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","Like other reviews posted, I am also a big NOFX fan and I find this to be their worst album. Everything about it is bad, but I find a handful of the songs okay. ""Bob Turkee"" ""six pack girls"" and their cover of ""Iron man"" are the best. Don't waste your money on this album, not even if you are morbidly curious."
1,nofx fan,"well, take it from me. I've been into nofx since their entire ribbed album appeared in the A1 meats video, I've seen em many times and will continue to do so, I have at one time or another owned all of their albums. In fact, out of every band today, these guys are the only ones I would go out of my way to go see. I'm getting old... anyway, all told, I still would not waste my money on this album. it is quite crappy and fat mike would tell you that himself. don't bother with liberal animation either. if you gotta, get their live album for better versions of two older songs. or go see em live yourself. they play alot and will probably play some older stuff here and there. oh, s and m airlines is only marginally better. ribbed is their real beginning. and the longest line marks el hefe's entrance, which is when this band became who they are and have been for years and years..."
4,"Simple, no-frills punk rock the way it used to be","This collection contains by far my favorite NOFX material. Those of you who think NOFX actually improved after they moved to the Bay Area and added El Jefe will obviously disagree, but back when NOFX was poor, living in L.A., playing .... bars to 25 people (like myself), they were at their finest. The proof? They weren't making any money at it. Take away the raw punk edge, add some horns, gimmicky novelty tunes, etc and you get a polished sound that appeals to the mass audience. Great for their wallets, but not so great for punks who were fans from the beginning. Personally, I think they went downhill very quickly after S&M airlines, although there are still a handful of great tunes on Ribbed. If you like their later releases you'll probably hate this CD, but who cares? You'll most likely be on the next ""punk"" band bandwagon anyway."
1,Stick to 7th Gen Powder - This Gel Doesn't Cut It.,"I have been a happy user of Seventh Gen's Powder detergent and thought I'd try the Gel. Turns out it's very difficult to make a Gel ""naturally."" This does not clean well at all. Stick to the powder - it's cheaper anyway."
3,If you have anxiety...,"If you have anxiety, 360 pages of info is overwhelming. Usually anxiety is not that complicated. Start with something simple that gets right to the point of reducing your anxiety (I did the program at selftherapy.org and loved it). Then if you want to become an expert, read a book like this.. highly informational, but not all that practical."
2,Disorganized,"Abolsutely one of the worst self-help books I have read. There isn't any structure, and it's not simplistic. The advice given is helpful but the authors then reverse the whole deal. Its like one chapter says this will be helpful, and then another chapter says it wont. It just goes all over the place and you cant really follow what the authors are trying to get at.A book I highly reccemend for anxiety and depressive related disorders is ""Feel the fear and do it anyway"" Much more simplistic, easier to read and get thru. And much more cheerful.I also dont like that these authors have seperated anxiety and depression from one another. I guess they do have a new book coming out that combines them both. It will be interesting to see if they have learned anything from their last two failures.But for someone that wants quick and easy advice, this book is certainly not for them. I'm afraid that this book of jargon will make it more confusing."
3,Question?,Does the kindle version utilize the audio (i.e. meditations) on the CD that comes with the paperback book?Thank you :)
2,Make people bored before really learned anything,"The book was not written in a way that people can learn the struts programming step by step. It may provide you a lot of theory, but you can not follow it to even run an example. All the examples provided are always just a small piece of the whole picture. There is no way that you can follow the example and run it to see the struts works. I am in chapter 5 now. I am still very confused. I think this book is good for the person who just want to learn the theory about struts and bost around. You can not tell people that I can write a struts program and show you that it works."
5,Excelent book!!!,"This book is really great. It explains struts in a simple and complete manner. It starts with an explanation about the basics of web development with Java and motivates the use of Struts. In the sequence it gives an overview of the framework and explains how the components of the application work together.Finally, there are a lot of well written chapters explaining details of this framework.I surelly can say that it is a book that everyone interested in learning Struts must have."
2,"Should be called ""Struts for Dummies""","I bought this book without really looking at the content because all my other O'Reilly books are the best on their subject. That was a mistake - O'Reilly have really dropped the ball on this one.Here's some non-trivial stuff the book didn't cover:1. A reference for the Struts tag library (""Go read the docs"" it says)2. How should my Action handle a ""Cancel"" button on a form?3. How do I get the properties file to be reloaded without restarting the servlet container?4. Does the javascript date validation work properly? It doesn't seem to handle ""dd-MMM-yy"" format....I think the author should have spent more time reading over the Struts mailing list to figure out what people really cared about.O'Reilly are at their best with books aimed at people who can read the online docs but want more. Unfortunately a better name for this book would be ""Programming Jakarta Struts for People Who Have Never Used Struts and Don't Know Too Much About JSPs""."
3,Not a tutorial - Don't buy if you want to learn struts,"This book should not be viewed as a tutorial. If you know nothing about struts and you want to learn, do not buy this book. You will only confuse yourself.It makes a great reference once you already know how to use struts, but you cannot learn struts from this book - at least how to code an app.Simply put, the author does not write this as a tutorial. It does have a running example but it is not a learning book."
2,Lot of holes,"The book is organized in a strange way. When I was looking at one example, the essential parts would not be explained until a few chapters later. Lot of details are left out (like some of the attributes of the config file were not explained). It seems that the author assumed you knew it already. A lot of time was wasted in hunting for the information back and forth in the book and sometimes I need to go to the Struts site to find out. A lot of frustration."
3,not very good for starters,"I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the book is not very good for starters. I found that I value any book by its ability to be a reference after cursory reading (usually we do not have time to examine books in quiet in front of a fireplace). I have 3 books on Struts and never used the book as a reference. The book is recommended as advanced guide to Struts, but I don't agree. Advanced Struts with pitfalls and gotchas is one thing, explaining how the Struts fit into overall good design guidelines is another.So, I have very mixed feelings about the book. I liked the author's willingness to explain but still...Well, 3 stars and mixin feelings. Strangely, Beginning JSP 2.0 from wrox got me going on Struts at no time. It is not devoted to Struts, but as kick start was very much helpful."
2,Waste of trees,"I was quite happy when I received this book but it turned out to be a waste of money as the examples are written in such scatterbrain fashion, the index is an example of corrupt laziness, and the introduction is a schizophrenic mess to get you even more confused. What's worse is that parts of this were written during a transition period between 1.0 and 1.1 struts so you're not getting a full picture of how struts really works. What's needed are good, fully developed examples of code since the API and documentation on the struts website lack such things. Instead, you get a half-assed section on taglibs which only are clips of what's needed to really get newbies started. I suppose if you want a ""high level"" introduction to the basic theory behind struts, this is okay. But for anything sophisticated, add a few more bucks and buy something with better developed examples."
4,Good as reference,"This is the first Struts book ever published and the one I bought when I first learned Struts. Being a Struts developer himself, the author understands the topics very well. For exmaple, the MVC design pattern was explained well, and so were Struts Validation, HTML , Bean, and Logic libraries. Tiles is also covered well. However, there are some parts where he stumbled. For example, he could not be sure whether the Action class is part of the Model in the MVC pattern or part of the Controller. Therefore, I don't think you should get this book if you just first learn Struts (For tutorial, get ""Struts in Action"" (Manning) or, better still, the lesser known ""Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial"")Overall, this book deserves 4 stars, included in my wish list for next editions are EL and JSTL (for the View part in the MVC) and real-world examples."
2,Convoluted and difficult to understand,"Usually I consult Amazon for a book reference. This time I decided to buy this book simply because it's O'REILLY.Well...I was wrong. While the author writes well and clear, I believe it was address to the wrong audience (for struts experts.) I found the examples to be very convoluted, and difficult to understand.It also appears as if deadline pressures influenced the construction of this book. (but that's my assumption)2 stars is best to reflect this book.Guzman, Dror"
1,Poorly organized book,The book is poorly organized. It gives very complex struts examples from the very start. It also gives a great deal of explanation and examples on JSP and servlets but not struts application. So if anyone wants a good introductory book on struts pick another one.
3,O'Reilly can do much better - this is beginners only,"For the last year or so I have been using Struts so I do not consider myself to be a starter. I read the book (almost cover to cover) and it is a good book. But it should be called 'starting with Struts'. Compared to other O'Reilly books (which i typically love) it does not have enought concepts and it does not have sufficient detail. What is left is a very, very good programming manual for a beginning Struts developer but a too limited resource for the more advanced strutsee. I am now going to read the Husted book, I hope to be more positive about that one."
2,Sorely Lacking,"I am very dissapointed in this book, as I purchased it thinking it would give real techniques for using struts. Instead it's just like so many other technical books out there where they give top-soil kind of overviews of the technology. It may be for getting basic concepts of struts, but whenever I find myself trying to lookup up real-world solutions there are no answers."
3,"Good content... but a-whole-lotta-""shoulds""","The book provides a good, basic foundation for working with Jakarta Struts from 1.1 and on. From beginner to advanced developer you'll get a good overview of what Struts is, does and some little details about the inner workings that you will benefit from knowing. Clear, concise examples make it a wonderful intro and reference.However... the downside to the book is that the author constantly talks about and goes too in-depth into the ""shoulds"" of development (i.e. separating business layer from presentation, MVC etc. etc. etc.). This is not a topic for the book and results in a lot of things that could have trimmed the book down (and the cost). There's just a whole lot that he didn't need to get into that made reading it a bit of a bore at times (since it's all standard stuff everyone already knows).Great book... just be ready to skip a bunch of sections in it."
2,Not very good,"i've just joined a new company using struts. i am a java programmer of more than 5 years but completely new to struts, this is the book i was given by my boss but i cant understand it. My main problem is that there are no good examples to follow as if the writter assumes you know struts already. In one word, disjointed."
3,A disappointment,"I've relied on O'Reilly books to provide the gist for any number of topics but this one disappoints on a number of levels. Too much filler material (if you don't know about EJBs and WARs then you shouldn't be reading this book) and an imbalance of detail. I need to know how to enable debugging in struts-config.xml or how to specify the message properties files in web.xml, not individual attributes to custom tags; I can find those in the javadocs.Granted it's a relatively new technology but this treatise didn't provide much more than what I could find on-line. There wasn't even decent coverage of the specifics of minLength and other validator features. Trash the fluff and stick to the details which implementors require and you might have a decent book.Now I'll just have to buy the Husted tome. It's not like I'm made of money, you know? I just can't recommend this book to someone trying to develop a production application in ""web time""."
3,Average presentation but Good coverage,This book was disappointing to me.It aspired to cover the Struts framework with a great level of detail. But it lacked clarity in presentation. It was constantly flitting between topics. The same material is covered in an overview and in-depth mode. The book was not readable.<b>Buy the book</b> ifyou want an indepth coverage of every struts topic.<b>Dont buy this book </b> if you want a good tutorial on struts. It will take forever to start writing struts applications. You need to read the whole book and summarize its content to yourself before you can start writing struts apps.
2,Implementation details lacking,"This book did a great job explaining to me *what* Struts is and *why* I should use it. However, when I actually sat down to start working I found the book had left me with little idea of *how* to use Struts. I'm going to take a look at Struts In Action by Ted Husted instead."
1,didnt understand even a single word,i could not understand what they are talking about. Please dont buy this book and waste your money. complete reference is a good place to start for beginners. Jbuilder is a cool tool to develop struts application. Struts is a cool technology. Hope some one writes a great book in the future. All books are so cryptic
2,Misses the point,"Reading Programming Jakarta Struts, I had the feeling the authors were grasping for methods to properly explain Struts to the user.There are far too many subjects introduce in the book without a meaningful method to part knowledge to the reader. After reading the book, a reader will be familiar with the various accronyms of J2EE but lacking a coherent picture on building a Struts application.Struts makes developing web applications using Java technologies relatively easy. Explaining how to best make use of the Struts framework is more complicated.It would have been a better book if the authors started with an example and introduced the various aspects of Struts through the example."
4,Hidden Sins,There aren't many African American suspense/romance writers and Ms. Montgomery hasn't disappoint me yet. I truly enjoyed Mara and Ethan adventure in finding her grandfather's buried gold. I was so engrossed in the clues and events leading up to them recovering the gold. There wasn't much romance between Mara and Ethan but that is typical in Ms Montgomery books she usually focus on the suspense than the romance. Its ok because she leaves you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. If you are into mystery and suspense you will enjoy this one.
3,"slow starting, but worthwhile chase","Despite the fact that this book starts with action in the form of a chase scene, the first half of this book really dragged for me.The first half of the book focuses on the two main characters in mostly one location. When I say one location, I do not mean a town or state, but actually one building that they never leave. This approach was probably used to help develop and show the relationship and related tension between the two main characters, but it got boring after a while. I kept waiting for something to happen.However, about halfway through the book, things pick up again once they resume the active search for the treasure. While I could never really grasp the idea of people frantically searching for stolen treasure as if it was rightfully theirs, this did turn out to be an interesting and worthwhile read overall.Note: This review was originally posted on Goodreads.com"
4,Intrigue with a hint of romance,"Great story, this is more an intrigue than a romance. Childhood sweethearts reunite to solve a 70 year old mystery to find missing gold. Only hiccup is the end is a bit of an anti climax but well worth the read."
1,Error In Paperback Printing!,"I gave this book one star because of one errorthat made me wonder if the money was well spent. Thefirst edition of the paperback version that I receivedwas missing pp. 228-260. Effectively making one fifthof the book, 2 short stories and 3 other sections,qualify as missing or incomplete.The stories that were there ranged from interestingto less than expected.INCOMPLETE SHORT STORIES:'The Mercy Gate' by Mark j. McGarry'Uncommon Sense' by Hal Clement"
4,Great Songs but incomplete info,Wow! What a great compiliation of trucking songs. It's a pity they didn't include more artist info & recording dates. (We IPod'ers need this info.)
4,Mr. Bum,"A hole heap of ren-necked fun. Driving down the highway playing this CD will make you a better person, I guarantee!"
2,extra light weight,I should have read the other review more closely. This is a good blanket for HOT summer nights! I believe it is too light for cold winter nights. I expected more for over $50. If I didn't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw! The color and texture are nice!
1,Find another blanket,I purchased this blanket for $30 from Amazon after reading the same reviews I see now. The negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after I saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than I expected from the review. The real issue is that the quality is very poor. I returned it and got a $30 blanket from Target and found the quality much better. Luxuious Egyption cotton--no way.
1,This thing sheds!!,"I don't know what's the deal with this blanket, after about 2 week's use, I noticed all these dust/lint balls on the floor, I thought it's just my dirty hardwood floor, but when I bunch them together, it's all brown colored, the color of my blanket.Even after 2 washing/drying cycles, lint continues to shed off the blanket.I bought mine at Bed Bath and Beyond in the spring, but they don't stock it anymore, so can't comment there.It's super light and comfy, mind you... its perfect for summer or fall winter, for someone who just needs something over their body in order to sleep.But I would never recommend this to anyone, well maybe my mother-in-law, she can have fun sweeping the lint off the floor."
4,FrameMaker+SGML Comments,"I have found FrameMaker+SGML to be an easy-to-use yet complex software tool. It has helped me create long, technical documents with structure (elements). Because of the structure, the documents were very easy to output to the Web.While creating structured documents does take additional time -- over unstructured FrameMaker documents -- it has made for better XML output. The extra work setting up elements and rules becomes worth it on the back end."
5,"Well, I'll take my time to do this...","...though few enough people will ever read it, because this book languishes in undeserved obscurity. This novel is a fascinating look into a life which is unimaginable to most of us--this life of a tiny, delicate midget,whose heart and soul are as large as she is small. This is not a book to be picked up for an idle afternoon'sreading (though it is not difficult to read), because it is truly like entering...well, a fairyland. If you are areader of high fiction, you will love it.And, though I'm evidently the only person in the world who knows this, it would make a world-beatinganimated film."
2,Much ado about very little,"I so wanted to enjoy this book, Walter de la Mare is truly a great poet and author of some gems in the short story genre. But I felt the steam went out of this novel approximately 100 pages into it, there was simply not enough plot development to sustain an entire novel. This is a character study that simply got out of hand. There is great poetry in the prose but I found that once the heroine of the title moves to the boarding house from her family home the book becomes a muddled mess with little rhyme or reason. The sense of whimsy and pathos that enriches the beginning quickly becomes a plodding dose of endless pathos without sympathy or motivation to attract the reader. I see that there is an appeal to this work according to other reviewers, but I simply offer my assessment as a counter-point."
1,I really wanted to buy this on the Kindle,"On vacation. No bookstores around. Needed to read for a book group. But after more or less reading the sample, sometimes able to decipher the multiple ""typos,"" sometimes not, I decided that even at 3.97 the experience would just be too frustrating."
5,"OK, I like this","I started drinking this because I was told it would help me get well.Well, it may have made me well but I discovered I like drinking it. It is a comforting relaxing hot beverage."
3,In Spite Of Rumors Without Fact,"I have given this book three stars. It is a fun interesting read in the way these two shared their art, practiced their craft, amazed theater crowds and fellow actors and went home every night for over 50 years and slept in the same bed. but then the dirt with no name starts. He sleeps with men, she sleeps with women. How do we know this? Well someone once heard someone saying it in front of a theater putting on one of their plays. Shame on the writer for even adding this. Oh and let us not forget that even though the writer can find NO ONE of the same sex that had affairs with them she does have one piece of evidence...The Lunts had gay friends!?! In the arts? I am shocked! My husband and I are both in the arts and also have gay friends. To the best of my knowledge no one has ever accused them of being straight."
5,Good Product,"Avery Self-Adhesive Removable Labels, 1-Inch Diameter, White, 600 per Pack (05410)Was cheaper here on Amazon.com than Office depot or Office Max. Always trusted Avery products with my PC and Printer."
4,Good product worth the purchase,"It's smaller than I expected. I didn't pay attention to the size of the sheets and they are not 8""x11"" but work well enough in my printer. It's also hard (for me at least) to get the cirlces to perfectly line up and I ended up just making them smaller than the sticker so they would fit. Other than that though it's a good product and a good price."
4,Great for our fundraiser!,"We used these as part of a ""Dress casual"" fundraiser- they are the perfect size (about the size of a quarter) and arrived very quickly!"
4,Used it to label the tops of my spices!,"These labels are the perfect size to fit the tops of spices. I have a pull out shelf that I use for my spice rack, and to easily identify them from the top (which is all I see), I use these labels."
2,Harold Lloyd's World of Comedy,"I was very disappointed in it, because I was looking for some complete episodes, not snippits of them. I had hoped to get 'Hot Water' and 'Safety Last', but only got bits of them. Also, I was not impressed with the fact that there were no itemizations on the preview on the amazon website.We did enjoy the videos we saw, and it just made us want to see all the episodes. I just can't afford $36 for the whole thing, and even if I buy one on your site, I have no idea what episodes are included on each one."
4,A Bit Unexpected,"Harold Lloyd was a great comedy star, and this CD is entertaining. I thought it would contain one or two of his films in complete form, but was surprised that it is a lot of short segments from various movies, grouped under several headings like ""Surprise,"" ""Thrills"" and ""Action."" It is still good and includes scenes from a later movie with sound. Just be aware of what how the presentation is organized."
5,Great fun from an actor we don't all know about.,"I discovered Harold Lloyd one night when I turned on Turner Clasic Movies and saw a hilarious 30-minute sequence from the movie ""Feet First."" I have shown that sequence to my husband, grandchildren (6 & 8) and sons and wives (in their 30s and early 40s), and everybody loves it. So I was happy to be able to buy a sampler of funniest scenes from Harold Lloyd movies, rather than have to watch the entire movies to see the funniest parts. This DVD was perfect. I gave it to my husband for Christmas, and the whole family laughed and laughed. Good therapy.Nancy Jean"
4,Read the label carefully,I thought I was buying the movie Safety Last but this is a compilation of movie cuts. Still fun but not what I was looking for.
4,Still a wonderful read.,"I first read Watchers at the Pond about 40 years ago. I was impressed by how real the pond became for me. The life and death struggle wasn't glossed over, it was just part of the wonderful reality of survival at the pond. This book is an out of print bargain that you can share with older kids while enjoying it yourself."
1,The poor thing can't stop the rain,"Our 85000 attaches to the Subaru Outback well. The problem is that it can't hold back the rain. In stand alone mode, we were camping and it rained. It rained outside, and inside. I found a note on the label inside that said something about the best waterproofing had been used but in heavy rain that water would come through. I wish I could have read that before I purchased it. What good is a tent if it won't keep out the rain? I seems to keep bugs out OK, but if it is going to rain, it should keep that out as well. They suggest getting a fly for the tent if you are going to use it in the rain. But it turns out they don't make a fly for this tent. I would look at the newer 86000 model. It is a slightly different design and comes with a fly. Maybe it can keep a little more of the rain out of the tent; maybe?"
1,Defective Unit,"This unit didn't work, just as it didn't work for somebody who reviewed it earlier. Maybe I got the one he returned. It is no longer sold so I got a refund. Amazon makes the return process very easy. You print out a return mailing label, attach it to the box it came in, and give it to the post office. The postage is printed on the label so it doesn't cost you anything. When Amazon receives it, they credit your credit card. Ace Hardware sells a unit that is simpler and probably better for many purposes."
2,Finally an Ash figure,"Now before I start, let me clear something up. I only gave it two ""fun"" stars, but this is truly a cool toy. It just wouldn't be any fun for anyone to play with. It is a statue, molded to mimic the famous pit scene from Army Of Darkness, and it will NOT be played with. Still, if you're a rabid Evil Dead fan, then this is a must. The accessories are really neato, and the little rubber Necronomicon prop is a toy all by itself, I kept finding myself with it in my hand, fiddling with it. My main gripes are that it doesn't look alot like Bruce Campbell, even though the prototypes looked flawless, and the shotgun holster kinda popped off. Oh well."
5,Bought it for my husband for Christmas 2009,"We've had this figurine for quite some time now, and only now thought to review it. It came in near mint condition, unopened packaging. My husband enjoys it (from it's place of honor, hung on the wall) and the movies all the time."
3,Simple problems,"This book is OK for simple problem solutions but if you are looking for a catch all, I recommend buying a engineering handbook. The problems are very specific and could do with a more generalized approach."
2,FREEZE THE WRITERS,"The screenwriters for this tepid thriller are to blame for its failure. The characters do so many inexplicably dumb things and plot hole after plot hole emerges.Why does Dylan Walsh (in a typically enjoyable turn) become so close to Rutger Hauer. He's killed the sheriff, a hunter, caused two other hunters to freeze to death, and he continues to try and escape. Even after Walsh has stripped to his briefs to keep Hauer from freezing to death. And how can he fall for Hauer's limp treatise on ""the wilderness and what it's become?"" It negates Walsh's character's heroic stance and just leaves the audience wondering why an obviously intelligent man would fall for such crap.What is it with the mayor? Why would he not want the leaking pipes fixed? Duh...Why is the sheriff's body found hanging in a tree?Why the ridiculous ending?I like Dylan Walsh, and even in bad movies, he tries his best, but he better stick to NIP AND TUCK instead of bombs like this one."
1,Unabridged -- unless you count the NINE missing stories,"Careful you don't expect the audio editions of this book to be identical to the hardback version. True, the FIVE stories included are present unabridged... but the remaining NINE stories in the hardcover edition do not appear at all in the audio versions, CD or cassette...Thanks."
2,King has gone downhill since the accident,"In my opinion, something very unfortunate happened in with King's accident. He seems to have lost that edge in his writing that kept me begging for more. I was pretty disappointed with this book, as I have been with most of King's post-accident work.There was really only one story that I found truly entertaining and that was ""The Little Sisters of Eluria"". I have only read one of King's Darktower series, but I think that is where his heart truly lies now. Everything else is just superficial.Also, a number of the stories had been published elsewhere. For my money, the story ""1408"" belongs on the audio-tape and should stay there. It was a great story to have read out loud, but it lost something in print."
4,Vintage King,"King is at his best when writing short stories, and this book proves it. I found it to be far better than ""Nightmares And Dreamscapes"" and on a par with ""Skeleton Crew"", but it wasn't quite as good as ""Night Shift"", which remains his best collection of short stories. King has really matured as a writer, but he doesn't quite crank up the scares like he used to. Still, there are some gems here. ""The Man In The Black Suit"" is the most frightening thing he has written in years, and fans of the Dark Tower series will love ""The Little Sisters of Eluria"". Unfortunately, King has the annoying habit of allowing his liberal politics to intrude on some of his work, and it ruins the title story. But all in all, this book is another great read from the master of horror."
3,A Nice Way To Pass A Few Hours,"This collection of stories is not King's best (at least, I hope not; I haven't read many others, but this can't be as good as it gets) but it's not terrible by any means. The tales are definitely ""dark"" but they really aren't that scary. The title story is the only one that really succeeded in giving me the chills, and as for the story whose illustration graces the cover -- it wasn't scary at all. Buy used or paperback if you can find it, and read the author's note. I usually skip over that part, but King has some great words on short stories and their demise. It's fantastic that he's using his influence not only to try and bring them back but to encourage his readers towards other writers in the genre. Let's hope a few of them listen."
4,"The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly",I will just write a short review on this one and not bore you with a lot of details. Some of the short stories in this book were excellent. A couple of stories were very mediocre for King and two stories downright stank. Since most of King's stories now tie in together especially with the dark tower series it is still a must read as is his collection Hearts In Atlantis. You get bits and pieces of information from most of his work now that give you more insight into the world beyond ours where Roland and the dark tower exist. Worth the read but if you are not a huge King fan like I am I suggest buying the paperback of this book.
4,"Good, haunting stories","King presented in Everything's Eventual a fine collection of stories. Not all of them are scary, and you shouldn't read it with the perception of going to read a ""scary book"", but just without any expectations. And then you'll notice that some of the stories are pretty eerie... even worse then you might expect."
3,14 stories but only half up to par!,"Make no mistake about this review, although it's not the highest I am a Stephen King fan and will more than likely read anything he puts out. This one has a few really good stories but for the most part it misses the mark. I can't recommend you buy it but you will definetely want to borrow a copy."
4,Watch out for reprints!,"Readers should know that the Roland story, Lunch at the Gotham Cafe, the airplane crash/Purgatory story, and at least one of the other stories in this volume are reprints. I wasn't expecting that, and I was disappointed. On the other hand, since the original publications were in less well-known venues to mainstream readers, they may still be new to many.I found this anthology to be entertaining but not especially strong. A buried-alive (or, in this case, autopsied alive) tale starts wonderfully but falls apart at the end. The gunslinger story is a little silly. The Man in the Black Suit and the haunted hotel room story stand out. Nothing in here had the impact, for me, of something like The Langoliers."
2,Disappointed,"Limiting my comments to the audio version of Everything's Eventual. Disappointment is one of the kinder words that comes to mind.Given that Mr Kings own readings have been uniformly exceptional (with the Dark Tower series representing one of the finest pieces of imagination I've encountered), the current audio presentation is rather lacking. In fact, the reading of ""The Sisters of Elyuria"" is so bad I never finished listening. The reader sounds alot like my 10 year old having memorized something uninteresting for a school presentation.Realizing that Mr. Kings time is likely his most valuable commodity, I hope his future audio releases include his own remarkable talent in this realm.JSH"
4,Another Fine Collection,"King's latest short-story collection lacks the punch of Nightmares and Dreamscapes, but every story in here is worth your while. Like potato chips, you can't stop with just one."
2,Kaliley,"All in all, I was pretty disappointed with this book. The creativeness in the stories is not up to Kings norm. Oliver Platt's narration of Autopsy Room 4 was good however the other narrators were perticularly ""dry"". Hopefully Muller will be recovered enough to narrate the finals in the DT series because Boyd Gaines as Roland in The Little Sisters of Eluria was THE PITS!!"
3,A Mixture of Old and New,"Everything's Eventual does not entirely contain new material, most of these stories have been published elsewhere. It is, however, a very enjoyable collection of stories.There are some real gems in this collection from the Hitchcock-like Autopsy Room 4 to the strange twist at the end of L.T.'s Theory on Pets. It even has an addition to the story of Roland, the Gunslinger from the Dark Tower series further explaining an episode from King's sequel to The Talisman, Blackhouse.As always King aims to please with this collection of short stories. Too often we get so caught up in novels that we forget the pleasure of a story, as King puts it, you can finish in one night."
3,Not As Good As His Other Short Story Books,"Did not enjoy this collection of short stories as much as some of King's others. Some of the stories were classic King, but a number of others were just plain flat, leaving me disappointed. For a better collection of his short stories try Full Dark, No Stars."
4,Just Like Old Times...,"I had a definite sense of deja vu while reading this collection of short stories from the undisputed master of the form.Once upon a time, King treated his readers to genuinely spooky, thought-provoking dark tales in short form. He seems to have returned to that era with this collection.After being disappointed with his last couple of books, it was great to see his work in some of its past glory..."
2,"Oh, well.....","The last King book I read before this, was 'Bag of Bones', which I absolutely loved. But this...the opening story, 'Autopsy Room Four', was quite funny; the next one, 'The Man in the Black Suit', could have been so much more, but still delivered a few chills. The title story was somewhat interesting, and 'That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is In French' had an interesting idea...but none of them quite delivered *the punch*. I didn't read 'The Little Sisters of Eluria', since I never gave a hoot about King's Dark Tower-series, and I read 'Riding the Bullet' a couple of yeas ago, and couldn't bear going through it again...it's utter crap! Mr King has written a good deal of great books, but if you wanna read his short stories, go for 'Night Shift' or 'Skeleton Crew'. This one doesn't do him - or the readers - any justice."
4,A Lot Of Fun From The Master,"A nice collections of short horrific stories. Every one of them a winner.I hope that King keeps writing despite his earlier comments. He does however make a comment in one of his introductions that repetition is his version of Hell. Too bad because these are a lot of fun.Strangely, the cover of the book is just as creepy as the stories as you gradually turn it from front to back things go from odd to down-right horrifying. Pretty cool.Now if we could just get him to make at least one more visit to the sleepy little town of 'salem's Lot..."
4,Wonderful Collection of Short Stories,"Once again, King takes us on a rollercoaster ride of thrills and chills. Each story brings its own unique charm to the reader. While some of the stories aren't quite as fast-paced and terrorizing as others, the blend of themes is still quite captivating. I would highly recommend this book to any avid King fan as well as those interested in a trip down the dark alley of a very impressive imagination..."
4,Still Writes a Good Short Story,"I enjoyed the stories in Everything's Eventual. Do not understand the vitriol of the reviewers who threw out the one and two star reviews. Characters and stories are well crafted. It isn't Night Shift, but it stands on it's own."
4,Uneven but still good,"Not the best of King's anthologies but still easily worth the price of admission. Yes, I guess many of these stories have appeared in one form or another before, but I hadn't seen them (and I am an inveterate King fan). 1408 and Everything's Eventual were my favorites - classic King - and all in all I enjoyed this collection a lot more (perhaps because I expected less) than several of SK's recent novels."
4,11 out of 14 ain't bad,"Stephen King comes out with his second short story collection,""Everything's Eventual"". The fourteen stories in this book touch on all different emotions. Stories talk about love, divorce, ghouls, and murder. They have emotional conflict about wheter it's better to give up one's self or someone else whom you love. I'm just touching on the subjects covered because I don't want to give away anything to in-depth on the stories. The thing I like best about these stories are that they can be read in about an hour instead of 2 weeks like a normal King novel. So if you like King but hate the length of his stories, this is definitely for you. Also if you like the lost art of short story telling and are looking for some good stories, this is for you."
2,Boring!,I was so exited when I heard King was publishing his first new collection of short stories in over a decade. But every story reminded me of something I was forced to read in 11th grade English class. Can't figure out how so many people are gushing over this book...it pales in comparison to his previous collections. Disappointing and boring.
3,not so hot...,"I have always considered King to be one of the best living writers; I began reading his books and stories when I was about 11 years old, and have been fascinated ever since. Unfortunately, it seems that since his near-fatal accident a few years back, ol' Stevie just hasn't got the juice anymore. I purchased and read On Writing, his memoir about the craft of writing, and it was good...but it seems in a strange way that in this collection of stories he violates most of the fundamentals of writing for entertainment (don't let your own voice intrude on the story, etc.) that he espouses. I think this is a common thing for brilliant artists to go through (think Trey Anastasio); it seems like their own neuroses ""eventually"" catch up with them and drown their art...but let's hope I'm wrong."
3,Truly not King at his best,"I have read the majority of the books published by Stephen King. I really looked forward to this release. I read with eagerness, and was left very unimpressed. The Sisters story was already released in a best of Science Fiction publications. The story, Everything's Eventual, in which the collection was named, was somewhat interesting, but my oh my did the story go nowhere. I know that King has many great stories ahead, but this one was not it."
5,Great book for King fans,I loved all the stories and the way that they were arranged. Autopsy Room Four kept me awake!
4,From quirky to down right scary....,"This book has something for everyone. I have not been a big Stephen King fan so I thought I'd start with some short stories to test the waters. Each story is very different and yet I have yet to find one that wasn't a page turner. If you want to get a taste of the different styles of Stephen King, this book is a great starting point."
1,bad bad bad,"I have read better stories from freshman english students. Ever since Stephen almost became road pizza his writing has been awful. what a shame. If some of these stories were submitted to the New Yorker under another name, other than Stephen King, it would have been met with a rejection notice and a huge laugh. Save your money!"
2,WHY ONLY FIVE STORIES?????,"I'm a bit frusterated that not all the stories are included in this set. It's not unabridged if it's not all there. Unless future volumes are in store I will be really upset. I want Riding the Bullet on Audio. I want a professionally recorded LT's theory of pets. I am almost ashamed of this set because of the nearly 2/3 missing in this ""UNABRIDGED"" edition. Shame on whoever put this together."
2,everything's mediocre,"king, king, king. what were you thinking? this was dull. i loved his other collections, but this was bad. some of the stories were in fact awful. like ""lunch...."". SK is famous as a plot-builder, but here the lack of plots and the mediocre telling of the stories, were seen so clearly, it was amazing. the ""points"" of the stories, were mostly really dull. only two stories delivered ok, and they weren't great either. ""dark"" tales? the only thing giving me a ""dark"" feeling, is the fact that SK could manage to write this stuff."
2,Disappointed,"I was sorely disappointed with King's first collection of shorts in a decade. It appeared to me that King is running short on ideas and has resorted to recycling old plot lines; ""1408"" seemed to be a cut apart version of ""The Shining""."
2,Disappointed?!,"King's synonymous to horror fiction but unfortunately, it's otherwise this time round - disappointed despite the raves about his book. Instead of page-turning, it lulls you to sleep."
2,not very good,"I liked the story about the hotel room, but, all in all, it wasn't a collection that held my interest."
4,Vintage King: terrific short stories.,"This is likely King's best short story collection to date. Several of the stories (The Man in the Black Suit, Everything's Eventual, and The Death of Jack Hamilton) are of literary quality. The rest are largely a return to the tight, well-crafted short stories that marked King's early career.The only piece I did not like was the Dark Tower story. Never been a Dark Tower fan. Even so, there is something in this collection for everyone."
3,"Sorry,","...but i couldn't get past the first coupla' stories! (By the way, I like almost all of the rest of King's work.)First of all, I should say that I really don't like short story collections to begin with, and when I found out the next ""short"" story was 60+ pages long, and threw the book across the room, against the wall!Well, not exactly, but I was relatively sad, because E.E. houses my now-favorite short story, ""The Man in the Black Suit."" (Which won an O'Henry [award])Although it houses SOME decent short stories, it doesn't have enough. I myself prefer the now-somewhat rare ""Six Stories""(?), a much shorter version of E.E."
5,Outstanding,"I have never in all of my life read a more excellent book other than the Bible explaining in intimate detail of God's attributes. Since this preacher was known in his day for his outstanding detail to his writings, this is a must read. It must be read slowly as someone else said, a bit at a time. I have been moved to tears at times as I've read this book and it has blessed me tremendously."
5,A Gem,"Mr. Charnok's logic is impeccable, his prose beautiful, his inspiration Godly and the value of his contribution beyond measure. My only regret is that the publisher decided to single space the small type of this large corpus. This generated eye fatigue for my aging optical organs. However, as testamony to the works greatness I found the discomforts were far outweighed by the spiritual rewards. I plan to purchase a copy for my pastor. It will enrich the lives of the layman and set fire to the words from the pulpit."
5,None Better,"The grace of God has produced in this book over 1000 pages of hearty food for the soul.....but whatever the price, it is well worth it...one of the best books the great providence of God has gracefully led me to......"
2,Boreing,Its a book that adds nothing more to the Christian experience then adding another book to the mix. It might be a good browse through.
4,This is a review of the 1991 book...,"but overall, I thought it was pretty interesting. I can't even imagine excluding any of my children from my will - and we have all weathered ups and dowsn. So I found it fascinating that some celebrities - like Bing Crosby, for example - chose to omit his kids from his will. I'm kind of snoopy and I liked this book."
2,Wills of the Rich and Famous,"The book, wills of the rich and famous, contains many interesting looks at the oddities of rich and famous people as can be seen through their wills. However, this book is definetely not a book I would recommend to people who are looking for casual reading and are not trying to write a will based on a famous persons."
2,FlashTrax XT,"It is a great item except it will not accept cards of more than 1G.It chokes on anything larger. I was assured by the company it would work with my 2G cards, but it does not.While talking with technical support they revealed the unit will not work with anything larger than 1G. It will sometimes work with a 2G card, but rarely.If you use nothing larger than a 1G card the product is great."
3,Mediocre For Hyde,"I fell in love with Hyde's 3 previous historical thrillers, 2nd Assassin, Wisdom of the Bones, and The Gathering of Saints. House of Special Purpose however was below average. It started out good, but just did not have the thrilling narrative that the previous 3 thrillers possessed. What they had in spades this one has barely enough. It was interesting however, as Hyde's historical thrillers are, the conspiratorial pose set amongst real historical figures and events lends these books a great tangible feel. The JFK assassination, and the Battle of Britain. This Hyde thriller just didn't quite pull it off. I enjoyed it and finished, but just didn't love it, I guess it had big shoes to fill."
5,The history of a movement...,"Despite the pro-leftist stance of the author, this book is a classic. It details the history of a movement that resisted government coersion with a great deal of success considering what they were up against. To fully understand the inner-workings of the counter-civil rights movement, or better stated the White rights movement, this book is a must read. http://cofcc.org"
4,One song and I'm hooked,"I have only heard ONE song off this album, but it's so beautiful I am hooked! I play it over and over...I wish there were sample songs on here for us! I really want to hear the rest of this album to make sure it's really as good as I think before laying down some cash for it. If you know of a place to hear some clips, post a comment!"
1,Not a TROY replacement,"This is advertised as a replacement for a Troy MIRC toner. I installed this into a Troy 4100 and the printer says ""Install MIRC toner"" This will not function as a MIRC toner in a TROY printer."
3,I Didn't Really Understand It,"I caught this movie on the Sundance tv channel. I didn't understand the plot and I wasn't crazy about it.There's something about these two guys who are twins.However it seemed to me that there are even more creatures running around that look like those two guys. After awhile I lost track of who was real and who was some sort of ghost.The plot isn't even remotely possible, even given the constraints that's it's a movie about creatures and things like that. You can have a movie about creatures but still tie it in with a belieavable story.Jeff MarzanoMoonlight Sword & Jade LionBlack Widow DVDPossession"
4,Well written comprehensive overview of Swedish history,"Unlike the previous comment on this book I have to say I did not find this a dry history at all. While not in the Tom Holland ilk, it is written in a way that addresses the reader. It is informative and clear. Nordstrom has chosen to break up the book into different eras of history and within these write about the different strands, e.g. political, economic, social history. This is a difficult task, especially as he covers over 2000 years of history in about 160 pages. All in all, considering the size constraints, he has done an admirable job. Well done to him, I have enjoyed reading his book. I only wish there were more Swedish history books available on kindle so I could further my interest in it."
2,Extemely dry history,I love history. I thought this extremely difficult reading and gave up after 20 or so pages.
4,Yesmeansyes to the Hanson Brothers,"Nomeansno's alter-egos, the geeky, ice-hockey, Ramones-obsessed Hanson Bros return with another offering of Canadian brew-fuelled tunes, and as usual it's a cracker. There's not an awful lot to explain here - if you know of the Hanson's previous efforts then you'll know what to expect; 15 tracks in all, including a cover of the 70's classic 'Get it right back', two-minute, melodic dash-for-the-finish-line stompers, heavy on that distinctive NMN sound of bass and drums.'Give me anything', 'I've been there', 'Honey, I'm home', 'Rookie of the year', 'Joey had to go' (about the late, great Joey Ramone) and the hilarious 'Tranquil', surely the best song NOFX never wrote. Should you get it? Hell, yes. Especially when they have an instrumental called 'Unsung heroes' that sounds as if it was lifted from the old 'Charlie Brown' cartoons. Your life needs at least one Hanson Bros album, might as well be this one!"
3,Uriah Heep - 'Sweet Freedom' (Sanctuary) 3 1/2 stars,"First released in 1973, this was their follow-up to 'Magicians Birthday', as well as Uriah's seventh effort. I'm just now discovering something, but I've never previously known about this album for some reason(s). Thought I had every one of their '70's releases on cassette at one time. I've ALWAYS wondered where ""Stealin'"" had originally come from. Couldn't find it on their other lp's, so I assumed it was a single-only available track when it first came out. Anyway, this is a pretty decent reissue CD, with the lp's original eight cuts + six worthy bonus tunes tagged on for your listening pleasure. Best songs are, of course ""Stealin'"", title track ""Sweet Freedom"", ""If I Had The Time"" and the rocking ""Seven Stars"". Good heavy British rock & roll."
3,One of my Favourite Bands...Pardon my taste,"Yes. I admit it. I'm a Heepster. 70's molases grunge with all its innocence and ballad-angst. The guitar, organ, etc... is OK, but not the riveting display of virtuosity other fellow reviewers have compiled - enthusiastic, yes - which is part of the appeal of this band. Uriah Heep, you either love it or hate it."
2,Sour predictability,2 1/2Spirited but ultimately somewhat bland classic rock contains enough positive energy to speak to fans of the genre but not enough personality for much outside appeal.
4,Great classic...but,Great classic album. The supposedly remastering job is horrible!! Is there a label out there than can do the mighty Heep justice? Buy the domestic version. It's better or at least the same in quality at half the cost.
2,vinyl is better,"I have owned this album on two cd's and one record. One cd was a remastered album from Japan. Both cd's were unlistenable. In the cd remixes, they both are very harsh and bright. The upper midrange is piercing. I only wish that I had a good comment on the cd that I bought, but no, I really can't think of a thing. I know this is right because the original record album was great in comparison. The performance was classic, and the sound was invigorating. I loved that album. This is not the only case that this has happened. It seems that quite a few albums from that era were rushed through the process to get a cd on the shelf as soon as possible. Even the cd players(NAD, Carver, and couple of others) had special circuitry that could be used in order to deal with the brightness of the cd format in some cases. Now, cd playback can be a great thing, and SACD even better. I was hoping that this would have survived half assed attempt made here."
5,Delightful for children and adults,This clever story is a delight for both children and adults. The illustrations are as entertaining as they are beautiful. This book is one that a parent would never tire of reading over and over!
4,childhood lost,"I think a lot of this book is more than just about the Dionne quints and their lives. How many other poor defenseless young children are brought into this world only to be treated as though they had no right to have been born. The poor souls. They were made to feel guily for having survivied and dividing their family through no fault of their own. I found the most inspiring part of this book to be the introduction by Cecile Dionne who says that after many hard years she has learned that being born and survivng was not her fault and that she should no longer bear any guilt for it. That is a lesson a lot of other people need to learn as well unfortunately. How sad that anyone especially her family members would make her feel that way. A human life is a miracle and a blessing. And the Dionne quints were 5 little blessings. How sad that the joy and innocence and trust of young children is always stripped away,and in the case of the Dionne sisters, in a particularly cruel and unfair way."
3,"Great Oven, so-so toaster","The toaster oven looks great, and works great as an oven. The toaster control is very OLD School - a basic twist timer. You must turn the timer to your desired setting every time you use it, and if you toast back to back, the second item will be much more brown than the first (assuming you use the same setting). Not happy with the toaster function at all..."
2,Not like the Toaster Ovens of days gone by,"I received this as a gift, and was thrilled to have it. I put my old Sunbeam 2-slice toaster away, and put my new toaster oven to work. That was 3 months ago, and I have now pulled my old toaster out, and use that.I've had the same problem as some other reviewers - the timer function is very flaky. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't. Toasting two slices of bread takes at least 5 minutes - since it doesn't toast evenly on the top and bottom I end up flipping the bread over to even out the doneness. I had actually quit using the Toast feature, and just cranked up the Bake feature to 450 and using that to toast. I will be contacting B&D; to voice my complaints, and hopefully can upgrade to a toaster oven that works, and works well."
2,Rather disappointing device,"Okay, so I had this oven for a little over 2 years, when it decided to crap out on me yesterday. I thought for the money I spent it would have had a longer life. Oh well....Overall an okay product, nothing fantastic by all means. Used mine on a daily basis, since my husband loves his sandwiches toasted. The oven feature is okay. Took a little while to reach desired temperature, but at least the house didn't over heat as it would using my regular oven. During the last few weeks of my oven's short life, it started over cooking things. I would set the temperature at 375 to cook my costco meatballs and within 10 minutes they charred up. Same problem when toasting bread. So, after it's tragic ending, I drove to our local bed bath & beyond store last night and purchased the Cuisinart TOB 195 oven. Yes, a bit more costly, but I am praying this one would make it past 2 years."
4,Great and fun!,"You know, I like this game, it's got everything; track, swim, hurdles, skeet shooting, diving, javilin, biking, weight lifting. It has horrible graphics, but fun things. When I ordered it, I played it right away. I just love PS1 and PS2. They are fun and so is Sydney olympics. And best of all, my name is Sydney! I know that is sooooooo cool! So get it, but beware of the graphics he, he, he..."
2,What a geez,"I am a novice table tennis paddler and was thrilled when Singapore got in Olympics. However, thisgame as you can call it is bad!"
5,"Little Heroes, a great show","This is a very cute show. It has good values and is enjoyable for the whole family, young and old. The grandparents enjoyed it even more than the kids. I especially like the dog!"
2,More info elswhere,"I recommend, instead, Pauline Maier's _American Scripture_. There you will learn that *the* Declaration in the National Archives is not the original. The original that was sent to the printer was lost. Also, there were *many* declarations of independence, including one that was almost identical to the one passed by the Continental Congress but claimed to antedate it. Also, independence was approved July 2nd and it was this day that John Adams initally expected would be celebrated as the nation's birthday. AND the Declaration itself was almost an afterthought at the time - only two people signed it on the 4th. It wasn't until July 8th that it was publicly proclaimed and read from the steps of Independence Hall."
5,"a sensitive, delicate, underated poet","Christopher Bursk's work has never risen as far into the American Poetic Pleiade as it should have done. His is a carefully notated, delicately observed work whose understatement belies its power. It is almost as if there is a poetic skin too few for Bursk with the world not mediated by the poem but the world becoming the poem. This suggests that Bursk's work is serious or uncomfortable; it can be both of those things. And deeply political. But humour is never very far from the surface of the poems often at Bursk's own expense as he looks at his own attitudes and perceptions with a wry irony. Christopher Bursk's best work is tender, reaching out to its subjects with extraordinary delicacy and warmth."
1,This was a good book until...,I loved this book until I found out it was just one piece of a book puzzle. This takes printing errors to a whole new level. I would like to read the book in its entirety if I could find it. Does anybody know how to identify a good copy?
5,Best Dog House!,"My St. Bernard loves this house. I bought it in the summer and duct taped the hinged door open for a few days. My dog is timid but after throwing in a few dog treats, encouragment and watching me crawl in and out, he became comfortable using it, so I took off the duct tape, crawled inside and he followed! It was a crazy tight squeeze to get out. The hinged door didn't bother him in the least and it is a great design for keeping rain out and removing in the summer. Now it is winter and he is very dry and warm. I agree with another reviewer that the dog creates his own warmth. I added a cedar bed, but would opt for the heater if it froze more often where I live."
3,Sounds Great But More Picture's Needed,I don't have this item. But presentation is poor! Can I look inside the dog house for myself? Or must I imagine?
5,My favorite!,"As you can see, either you'll love the seaweed bits floating in the tub or you'll hate them. I really like them, and the moisturizing effect they have on my dry skin. In my experience, they are much less messy than flower petals, and easier to rinse away. I don't like heavy, flowery perfumes, so Big Blue's light bracing aroma is very pleasant."
1,lelek44,"I did not like this bath bomb. I dont see how its a best seller. I did not like the way it smelled. When it melted in my bath tub, it left some type of sea weed in my water. Scent did not last long either! Waste of money."
5,Deep lavender and lemon in a bright blue seaweed bath!,"This is a great bath for getting off to sleep or just relaxing, but it isn't for the conservative bather! It releases a maelstrom of fizz and scent, and colors the water a rich blue color (I wish the ocean looked that blue!) and releases little seaweed pieces into the bath. It truly feels like an adventure to bathe in it, and is a huge hit with me.The seaweed is very slippery and doesn't stick to my skin, which is important, but you may like to get a little strainer for the drain if you are going to use a lot of Lush bath bombs!The bomb is moisturizing and highly scented, and the essential oils used are soothing and smell great. You really can get away with breaking these in half to use, but for the occasional special treat, try the whole shebang! It is lovely!"
5,how do i love thee? let me count thy ways,"This was the very first Lush product I tried and it is my absolute favorite. Everytime I purchase from Lush I always get 1 or 2 of these. The smell is just lovely, kind of citrusy with a hint of flowers. And it turns your bath water the most amazing color of ocean water blue. When I'm lying in a tub full of big blue water I close my eyes and pretend I'm a mermaid. Definitely a must have, at least for me."
2,Don't use in a jacuzzi,The scent was nice - the seaweed was not. Esepcially in a jacuzzi tub. By the time I figured out what was going on - it was a little late.Taking apart the jacuzzi after a bath sort of defeats the purpose of a relaxing bath.
1,Horrible Service,"After waiting for over 2 weeks for a gift for my wife (a week after mommys day) with shipping information saying it would arrive right before or a day after. NOTHING...Then when I contacted the company they try to blame Amazon, that my order was blank. Amazon emails there orders to there customers. It has products in it. Either way save your self some time order from someone other than LUSH."
2,Not for Me,"I use a lot of Lush products. This one is not for me. Did not enjoy the smell and the seaweed in it was definitely a turn-off. Be sure to put it in a small piece of hosiery if you don't want to be floating in spider-leg-like pieces of seaweed. In fairness, I love the bubble bars so much better than the bombs. If you are a first time user of Lush and really wanting to experience the luxury of their products, I would recommend trying one of the ""candy-scented"" bubble bars. They are all to die for!!"
2,This is one of the better smelling bath bombs by Lush,"This is the 4th Lush one I've tried. Out of all of them, I liked this one the best. The scent was OK, but still not long-lasting. Anyway, I like the ones from Haute Tub *much* better. Their buttercream frosting, candy cane crunch and pumpkin pie all smell great. They practically smell up my whole house. Just thought I'd share."
1,Beware! Items are defective.,"Why are they still selling this item? I bought six heads. Two of the heads broke from the handle. I had used the heads for about 2 weeks each. After the second head broke, I returned the brush heads to Amazon for a refund. After reading the reviews, I can't believe that these heads are still being sold on Amazon. I have been using these brush heads for years (bought from other sellers) and have not had any problems with the brush heads until now. This was the first time I bought the heads from this seller. I won't be buying this item from this seller again."
1,"Defective, Break Quickly","I purchased these Oral B brush heads through Amazon from ""in stock novelties."" They appear to be German models due to the writing on the box. Regardless, they did not hold up well. The first head lasted a few weeks and then the brush tip came loose rendering it unusable. Subsequent heads have been loose, fall off the toothbrush, or break very quickly. This product is definitely not worth the money."
4,exactly as promised,"The toothbrushes were exactly as promised.One downside that I have is that they, like all of the others that I have ever had with this electric toothbrush, have a slot in the back of the brush, so that the spit dribbles out onto the toothbrush, and then possibly onto my hand, or drips off, so I have to be leaning over the sink to catch drips.The other drawback is that the brush can come off the handle more easily that I would like, so it sometimes happens while I am brushing my teeth. I don't remember that from earlier ones, but that may be the age of my toothbrush (which is almost 10 years old now) and not the fault of the replacement heads."
1,Least favorite Triumph record,"Way too lite and pop sounding for me, they totally lost their edged on this one. But the tour was fantastic."
1,order,I never bought this book I don't know why it is showing up. Hope you did not charge me for this please check your records.
2,Very old,"Too old but would give more stars as has a great beginning if I had more time. Definitely must have an inclination to the 'historical eras', which I do. If I had a lot of time I'd learn from and appreciate this book more, however for now I'll just stay in THE WORD OF THE BIBLE. Not good to use for study as is, imo. Written in the late 1800's or early 1900's, can't remember for sure. Oops, sorry... :("
4,I thought it was good...,"This movie was really cheesy, the acting was pretty bad, but it's fun. I am not a GND fan, but I love a cheesy horror. There were three stories. The first is about a guy that brings home a scary homicidal doll that forms an infatuation on him. In the next story, Bridget Marguardt plays an over-the-hill actress who encounters a horrible fate when she tells her agent that she will take the last roll on Earth as long as the check clears. The third story reminded me of some of the older slasher movies that I grew up on such asWhen a Stranger Calls. It involves three girls that make prank phone calls and overhear a murder. Because they forgot to block their number, the killer called them back and told them that he would kill them if they went to the cops. There isn't a lot of gore, it really isn't that scary, and the worst acting in the movie came from Bridget and Holly."
2,not bad,"oh no! sad to say i'm what reviewer j. brannon clearly loathes: ""... a horny male idiot expecting to see all sorts of nekked pseudo-lesbians ""goring"" themselves with sex (there is none)."" hey what can i say, i'm sick and need help! the movie is mildly entertaining. the stories are actually good. the women are very beautiful but not much for nudity or acting. gonna have to stick to the witchcraft series....signed,a horny male idiot"
3,It's not bad nor is it good.,"The Telling is a horror anthology that consists of a group of girls telling urban legends so they can be in an exclusive sorority of some sort. I was surprised at how good this movie is, but it wasn't amazingly good. The stories are surprisingly entertaining and quite original. The first one is probably the best due to the great acting, while the second one fails to entertain and the third is filled with cheesy suspense taken from an urban legend from the 60's but with a twist. If you're interested in this film to see Holly and Bridget then know that their acting was the worst in this film, especially Holly, which actually gets distracting. But for the most part, the movie isn't bad and deserves a rental."
4,Go Girls!!,"Congratulations to Bridget and Holly on their first film! If you want eye candy, then buy this film. Not only are all the women in this film gorgeous, but oozing sexiness. The sets and production are first rate. My favorite stories are about the evil doll and the one Bridget's in with the eerie masks. Job well done and hopefully much more to come from these beautiful, talented women."
4,Not a bad movie,"This movie contains 3 short horror stories. Holly was great as the mean head sorority sister. The undead crew and the fading actress was the creepiest but I don't really think Bridget is meant to be an actress. The last story was the best and the acting was good. But who was the killer?I wasn't expecting the ending. I don't really understand all the hype about sororities and wanting to join and be like them. If you enjoy being shallow, partying and being bitchy, then I guess you'd want to. Truthfully, I find sororities and fraternities useless. They really serve no purpose. And they don't want anyone that's not up to their standards. I really hate that. I think anyone should be able to join, regardless of the name. I cheered for the girl that killed all of them. Down with evil sororities!!"
1,Not so great,"I was very excited to get this movie; however, this movie was really bad. I feel really bad to say that because I really like Bridget and Holly. They were both great. Nevertheless, the rest of the actors were very cheesy."
5,"If you love ""The Girls Next Door"" This Is a MUST HAVE!","I will admit, anything that has my favorite girls on, I will buy! ""The Telling"" stars Bridget Marquardt, Holly Madison and Sara Jean Underwood from ""The Girls Next Door"". Plus there are DVD extras on it. Well worth the money. A Must Have for your GND collection!"
5,Scary Stories,The TellingA nice bit of movie behind-the-scenes about the movies. I hate to say it but I was as shocked by the ending as was the sorority head mistress Stephanie(Holly Madison). You just gotta see the role Bridget Marquardt plays.I say one should view this movie for the video stories (3 of them) plus the final ending. A true shocker!
1,Seriously?!,"Here it goes, after I heard about our local movie store was closing I decided to go and buy movies because they were 50% - 70% off the original price. This movie was one of the many movies I bought, I really didn't have much to do today so I watched it.....it sucked! I'm also a huge fan of ""The Girls Next Door""and that's another reason why I picked this movie up. The acting was cheesy, the production was lame and the film quality was crappy! This is a movie that is going to never be played again and just sit in my movie cabinet. Save your money and brain cells."
1,terrible,"This movie was terrible. I was disinterested throughout the entire movie, and my friends and I talked the entire time. It was the worst movie. I guess that maybe its my taste that drove me away from this movie, but I thought that the acting was not that great."
1,Typical Saxon,"Notice all the reviews are older for this book. Math has changed a lot in the last 10 years due to calculators and computers.I've taught and tutored high school and college math for over 20 years. Saxon books are generally recognized by most teachers across the country as not being very good. They don't give students enough practice with a topic, they don't present the material well, and they offer an insufficient amount of supplementary material.Math is like a sport. If you just learned to shoot a basketball through a hoop, trying it twice isn't enough. This is how Saxon presents the material.Saxon is good for elementary school, but after 6th grade it tends to lead kids to math anxiety because of the lack of practice. Home schoolers have a momentum of using these texts and they should ask the opinion of professionals (high school and college professors) regarding their use."
4,"This book is cute, cute, cute!","I purchased this book for my daughters for Christmas. They had just seen the movie in November, and they loved it so much I just had to get them the book. I chose this one instead of the original by Kay Thompson because I wanted my precocious (almost) three-year-old to be able to enjoy it, as well as my seven-year-old. The book was a big hit, with tons of pictures from the movie and a very readable overview of the film. As with most books that are taken from a film, it does vary slightly from what really happened on screen, (hence the four stars), but it is close enough to delight my little girls. All in all, it is an adorable book and any girl will love it!"
1,Much wiser now,"I ordered an assortment of chips, what I got was 36 bags of crushed original style chips. I wrote Wise Company and their response to me was They hope I will be happier next time. I can garentee that there won't be a next time."
4,Naval Ha-ha's,"Well, I did read this book repeatedly in the late 50's and early 60's, so I cannot in good conscience rate it lower than 4 stars. It is a moderately entertaining, and by now quaintly old-fashioned, story of some admen pressed into U. S. Navy Public Relations service in the Pacific. While everyone else fought the Axis, they fought the Air Force for their fair share of public recognition. The funniest bit is where the PR guys launch a ""Typical Young Navy Man"" campaign and select their candidate sight unseen, merely because his name contains two famous naval historical figures--Farragut and (John Paul) Jones. When he comes ashore for briefing, he proves slovenly, foul-mouthed, and all but intractable. The movie version memorably bleeped out his every use of the f-word with a ship's horn that sounded every bit as foul as what it was masking!"
4,hoodlums and druggies of 1940s Washington..,"George Pelecanos must really love or hate his home town of Washington. He always seems to write about it, but what he writes about won't appear in any Chamber of Commerce brochure. Druggies, organized crime, and ethnic violence seemingly permeate the lives of all Washingtonians.""The Big Blowdown"" departs from the author's other works in that much of it reads as a biopic. We are given a ""Reader's Digest"" biography of a young Greek-American man raised in 1930s/1940s Washington. While it is all not uninteresting even fans of the author will find it to be a prosaic. Fortunately halfway through the book all the characters from this man's childhood come together for a very violent, and well-written, conclusion. The author deftly tackles subjects like loyalty and personal ethics along the way.Bottom line: despite its slow start this book ultimately comes together with ""oomph"". Recommended."
2,Starts great and fizzles,"Begins with the players as kids. Great depiction. Can see the kids in the old hood. Story flattens out, repeats and is stereotypical. Debated not finishing it half way through. Wish I put it down."
2,Dull,"I really wanted to like this book, but I just found it so hard to care in the least about the characters. I couldn't like them for being good, and I couldn't hate them for being bad - they were all in some kind of bland personality limbo, stumbling about being one-dimensional. I am a DC resident and read it on the metro every day and couldn't even get excited about all the familiar locations in the story. James Ellroy is much better if you are looking for hard noir fiction and interesting characters."
5,An excellent read!!!,"I read this book, along with Suckerman, after reading interesting article on Pelecanos on Washington City Paper and I was not disappointed. Excellent plotline and rich characterizations of immigrants and others in 1930s and 40s Washington. Pelecanos captures the feel of the streets, the diners, organized crime, and the sordid side of life like no one else I've read. I highly recommend this book."
1,Prime Number,I purchased this last year (Dec 2003) and never received a single issue. I do not recommend this purchase.
4,Lion Heart,"A young girl with an amazing heart gives an unsuspecting young man a real chase when she learns she is to marry! Mrs. Stratton will have you on the edge of your seat; in tears, and laughing the next moment with this stand-alone romance about a girl, a boy, and adventure!"
5,"Laugh, cry, take your pick","This book had me on a roller coaster ride. In one minute I was laughing so hard I had to put the book down (Rhiannon is quite a character) and the next I was bawling like a baby. Rhiannon is a mischievous child of a Lord who only wants to get her married to someone rich and powerful. However, she has other ideas. When someone finally does come along, he turns out to be the nephew of the horrible Dark Count, her father's latest marriage prospect. I won't say any more, bu you have to read this book. I love Ms. Stratton's books, and have read all of them. I am now on to Vain Wish, which from what I understand is completely different from her other books."
3,LisA,"I guess this book is OK, but the personalities of the main characters irritated me, especially the girl."
5,Had I only known I'd have shrink wrapped that book,"I received my copy in 1989 before the birth of my first child [I have 8 all mine], I didn't understand the worth of what I had. The timeline diagram of age and effect was awesome. The indepth coverage from puberty thru menapause was phemomental. It had chapters for every aspect of the female form including special chapters on sexuality, male/female and female/female relationships. It was and still is a must have. I would like to give all my daughters and nieces a copy, so this wonderous work could be enjoyed"
5,Great Book,"It's a wonderfully written book with many pictures, great projects and can give you many ideas for your own quilting needs."
4,Consistent tennis wins two.,Ideal for a player who has a general idea of all tennis strokes and wants to know some more on how to win tennis games. The colour became too sharp at times and this can be irritating.
4,Fine Flanagan,"I don't think Tommy Flanagan ever played anything, either as a leader or a sideman, that wasn't worth hearing. From first note to last ""Sea Changes"" features the same impeccable muscianship we (and a myriad of his fellow musicians who were blessed to have him on their own sessions) came to expect from him......maybe to count on him is a more appropriate way to put it. What I didn't know about was his skill as a composer: five of the eleven tunes here are Flanagan originals. The uptempo ""Verdandi"" leads to some rollicking playing all around, while ""Delarna"" is a lovely ballad; the other three pieces are quite good too. Another highlight is Flanagan's bluesy piano on Ma Rainey's ""C.C. Rider"" and.....well let me finish by just saying that every cut has much to recommend it. Bassist Peter Washington and drummer Lewis Nash (great brush work!) offer able support throughout. Fine Flanagan as expected!"
3,Liliane,"This book is a confusing book. It uses images that are vivid in every way imaginable. Liliane is a young woman who is on a quest for her true self. She doesn't want to come to grips with the facts of her parents. Shange strings together memories, dreams, and expectations of a young black woman to bring her to life as we read about her. Victor Jesus, Zoom, Thayer and Sawyer are her lovers who reveal a different side of Liliane that her family and friends aren't fully aware of."
2,Disk was flawed,The last part of the disk was flawed and would not play. There was more text context and less animation that I expected.
1,bible stories from the new testament,I was looking for movie DVD's and we recieved a read along that was not accurate to what the bible says. I don't appreciate the lying and not telling the whole story as the bible states. You should have stated that it was a DVD autio. I was looking for an animation movie for my children.
1,No meat,I read nothing insightful or useful. the word meandering comes to mind. I am putting it in the recycling bin.
1,soft core science,"I regret that I have to agree with the other one-star reviews of this book. I was also intrigued by the title, the descriptions on the back, etc. and therefore bought it, proving once again that you really can't judge a book by its cover. I know nothing of the author's more technical work, he is apparently an established researcher of some sort, but this book is largely a collection of unsupported speculation and seat-of-the-pants philosophizing. It is extremely light weight material. Very disappointing."
4,Bourne Idenity,"This version of Bourne Idenity does not have all the ""action"" that is in the Matt Dameon version but this one explains a little better the ""whys"" at the end of the movie. Same story just told a little differently with less action and more emphasis on charactors."
4,This movie remains true to the book from which it is taken.,"Except for a slight but noticeable change of events at the end of the movie this film remains true to the book. Good acting along with a good story makes for a good time and that is what happened here. By filming on local in various European settings the viewer enjoyes a beautiful piece of work. Not the best international intrigue movie ever written, for that check out THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, but close to it."
5,"The ""original"" Bourne Identity","After seeing the most recent Matt Damon version, I'll admit that I didn't know what to expect. I was shockingly and pleasantly surprised, however. I actually liked this one better. Somehow, I never could quite get over a very young looking Damon in a role that Ludlum probably reserved for an older character. After watching the Chamberlin version, I came away wondering if the movie studio that put together the newer film wasn't trying to milk as much milage as they could out of a younger, sexier looking actor for their remake. This Bourne is older, more experienced, and surprisingly, a lot more believable in this role. No, the explosions weren't as visually catastrophic but the action never drags, not for one minute. I purchase and watch DVD's for their plot line and content and have been disappointed a number of times by 70's and 80's movie-making attempts. This one far outshines most from its genre. One of the best DVD purchases I've ever made."
4,More Accurate Than Movie,"Having been a Bourne series fan, I was intrigued when I saw this video for sale on Amazon.com. I had no idea it was out there and couldn't wait to see how close it came to the book as compared to the movie starring Matt Damon.I saw the movie before reading the book and was disappointed the movie didn't follow the book's storyline. Seeing this video available I decided I had to have it and have not been the least bit sorry. Although Richard Chamberlain doesn't really come close to either the character in the book or Matt Damon's version, it was an entertaining movie without a lot of special effects. It was more accurate than the movie both with the storyline and the locations noted in Ludlum's book. I have watched the video three times and will probably watch again in the future."
5,Best Bourne Ever....,"This is (to me) by far the best Bourne ever if you actually want to stick to the original Ludlum novel.The ""new"" Bourne with Matt Damon is a totally different movie for generation ""Y"". The pace, the believability and the european locations are fantastic. You really feel the 'tortured-ness' of Bourne(Richard Chamberlain)in his amnesiac role. Jacilyn Smith is beautiful, radiant and real too. If you liked the book-this is the closest thing to seeing it."
4,Bourne alternative,"For people who prefer story driven movies to action driven ones. This is a good alternative to the more popular Matt Damon version. Also, more chemistry between the two stars.."
3,Faithful to the book,"I found comfort in how closely this ""made for TV"" movie followed the original book; however, I could not wrap my head around Chamberlain's depiction of Bourne. Though the new Bourne movies have no resemblance to the books whose titles they share, I feel Damon presents a much more ""Bourne-like"" persona. Though I am a fan of Jaclyn Smith, again, something in the casting just did not mesh for me. I don't think I would recommend buying this, but if you found it at a library, I would not discourage you from checking it out and watching it with a bowl of popcorn during a rainy afternoon."
2,dont damn the film until...,"you read this. Ok to every one slamming the new film for not being true to the book etc etc etc please remembera) the books where set in a different era (70's 80's) and the ideas could not have transfered well to the late 90's/ 00's. main point being the vastly different technology we have now and the prominance of computers, satellite tracking etc.b) the screenplay was written by ludlum himself before he died (just after the film was released or finished i believe)and was onset as an advisor. think theres an interview on the dvd with him. he realised that it couldnt be a straight adaption for the reasons laid out before and that the film would only be 90 min +. so dont use the its not faithful to the original argument. it was never intended to be. it was an interpretation. this miniseries was hardly spot on (well more so than the current film but the acting was way hammier which is always a killer in my book)all in all ok. wudn give it tuppence for the new one though"
1,The Boured Identity,"The Bourne Identity 1988 is a feeble, mediocre Action and Adventure, Espionage Thriller adaptation.I tortured myself through hour and hour of it (188 minutes), and it proved to be consistently weak and ineffectual. It feels lacking in strength and force, the espionage premise is marked by an absence of style, the acting feels misused, its just not believable. Richard Chamberlain also did not seem that comfortable with his gun or handling himself when attacked. Chamberlain and Smith were not plausible characters - Smith was too ""superficial"", as was Chamberlain.This film seems without preparation, it seems like romance not an Adventure entertainment film, if nothing else, it seems like an incompetent version of the Robert Ludlum story. This was a clumsy, almost without any definite aim, direction, rule, or method film.The feeling of watching a soap opera continually spread into my head. What a disappointment. Don't waste your time."
2,Unwatchable!!!,"I dont know where all the glowing reviews are coming from but I couldnt be bothered to finish this snoozer. The dialogue is as mono/bisyllabic as you can get and on par with your average Aaron Spelling production. Chamberlain is a cold blooded killer just because he says so and not because anything we see of him. The producer/director were too busy making him available to Jacklyn Smith to fall in love with and they take every opportunity to make googly eyes at each other. ""I just need to be held"", she says. Puh-leeeez!!!I accidentally rented this one confusing it with the theatrical movie. I want those two hours of my life that I wastes back."
1,"Hogwash, not blarney, without any brogue","Possibly the worst read of the summer. Ludicrous situation, not a single character who could have existed outside of this fictitious nonsense. The very premise is insulting... two peabrained characters (the heroine and her aunt) decide that she needs turn-of-the-century adventure before marriage by becoming an adventuress, with no real understanding of what that entails. The hero is a staid, nice man who rescues them from the world. Bah humbug. I was bored and irritated...and the author has the talent to do better."
4,fun for all ages,We played this game with the whole family at Christmas and it was a blast! Good combo of old and newer television so all ages had a great time. A peice of advice though - be sure to team up with young and old if playing as teams to be fair. Great product and easy directions too. A great family game...highly recommended!
5,TV Fan? This is for YOU!!,Are you a T.V. fanatic? This Scene It? is for you!! Tons of fun!! Has clips from the '50's all the way up until this decade! Hours of fun! My Husband and I love it!
1,For older people only.,"I would not recommend this to a family with children. I couldn't answer the questions (I'm 31) and my husband, who is 46 had a hard time, too. We both consider ourselves TV watchers. Our 16 y/o was really bored. Thanks, Scene It, for ruining family game night!"
5,Additional info...,Also found another release (Synthpop for a Darkened Room 2) with a track by The Dignity of Labour called 'Satellite'. Another wonderful song!(...)
5,Not to be missed,"Normally I'm not into singles, because I'm not crazy about remixes and I figure I'll get the good stuff on the album anyway. This CD is definitely the exception, with three originals and consistently excellent remixes in varying styles. Every track shines with high production values and attention to detail. And most importantly, they are wonderful songs."
5,SO GOOD!,Dignity of Labour is what music is supposed to sound like! Everything about this song (xrv) is good. I just can't stop litening to it -- highly recommended.
3,"Interesting, offbeat mystery set in the Yucatan.","Gary Alexander's ""Blood Sacriface"" introduces us to a full blooded Mayan named Luis Balam. He sells touristy trinkets, and does tour guiding. Luis was also a traffic cop before a rich and powerful heir got away with murder due to corrupt higherups that let Luis go for pressing it. Luis now is hired by lawyer trying to find evidence on whether a missonary from Oklahoma is the serial killer ""Gilbert"", who kills young attractive women with a flint knife(possibly Mayan). Soon, Luis is warned to look away from the rich man who he tried to put away before, and he and the sister of the latest victim team up to see if the missionary was set up. Quirky characters, and a side of Cancun you have never seen. Good work of fiction"
3,Half decent,"I agree with Evan. Quality changes with each video and it worsens when the video fades into the next one. And plus, some video were definatlely left out. Keep Ya Head Up isn't on here like it says on the case. Brenda's Got A Baby, 2 of Amerikaz Most, Changes and all the THUGLIFE videos are left out of this DVD. I'm glad a less popular video like Wussup With Tha Luv, Made Figgaz Papa'z Song is on here, but it doesn't make up for the classic videos. But over, since its Pac, I'll enjoy it no matter what.PS (1)Why was there a non-related reggae video at the end of the DVD?and also, I notice who ever made this DVD tried to be slick and added the XXX version of How Do You Want It in the review of the video at the end of the DVD as well"
3,"Good videos, Bad quality.","The music volume goes up and down on certain videos and the quality of the music videos feels like a VHS copy to DVD. You have HALF of every 2Pac music videos, but not ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" and ""2 of Americaz Most Wanted"". Beware that this DVD also has advertasment for Iwanttobeontop.com an 1-800 # in every freakin video. The editing going to one video to the next was done so poorly, you almost want to stop watching it. Overall...this DVD gets three stars because its 2Pac, but the quality and editing and the way they organized the songs was low entertainment! Only buy this if your a true fan or you just want to add it to your collection."
5,Very helpful and easy to read and implement.,"This book, written by several well known and published authors lends experienced commentary as to what to do to help; what to say and what not to say. It should be in the library of every counselors, pastors and those interested in helping others. It covers a wide variety of crisis, disaster and traumatic events."
3,A good starting point,"I really regret paying $17 for this book, I should have looked at the number of pages before I bought it. I wouldn't really call this book an introduction. It's more of a starting point. It's like an outline, giving you bursts of breif information, very sketchy.I will say, though, that its very objective and does make good points; its thought provoking.What is really great about the book is that it lists many other works you can read for a more in-depth view of the specific topic. For example, it talks breifly about people that have had an impact on humanism throughout history, and if the few sentences about the person interest me, I can further research it myself. All of the names and novels are there to reference back on later.But in general, if you're looking for an introduction that's a little more than an outline, I suggest finding another book."
3,good but different,This is more of a story of the shows other thank a musical soundtrack - my son likes it anyway but i was somewhat dissappointed with it
4,Good product,Good product. Lots of parts - but easy to follow instructions. Sturdy and looks like picture and measurements were exact.
4,A nice step up for a bookcase,"I have gone through at least 7 cheapo bookcases over the last few years but this one is a keeper. For the price it is a nice piece of furniture. As I mentioned in my other reviews for this line though, the color is not white, it is cream. The pieces match each other well but they do not match white furniture. The antiquing is a tan color and is well done for RTA furniture. The extra detailing on this piece makes it a nice addition and it holds more than your cheapo bookcase and is worth the extra money especially if you are adding it to the other pieces of the collection. Happy shelving!"
4,THE RETURN OF DAVEY CROCKETT AND MR. G,"THE NAKED GUN: 2 1/2: THE SMELL OF FEAR still makes you laugh. Excellent second feature (which made more money than it's original), you can't go wrong with this on DVD. Widescreen transfer, excellent sound, and once again, group commentary with David Zucker (Director/Writer), Robert Weiss (Producer) and Peter Tilden (Host) - which is still very funny, but not as rapid or as detailed as THE NAKED GUN. There are a few long periods of silence here and there which drop this commentary a star, but by no means detracts from the overall presentation of this DVD. If you already have the first, you'll want the second, and won't stop till you get to the third... so, buy them. An excellent addition to any collection and a must for fans."
4,very funny!,"Not as good as the first in the sequence but still. . .Funny all the way! there are constant sight gag, horrendous puns, parodies! There should be a room at the top for a movie that is so entertaining. Don't miss it!"
5,One of my favorite movies,"Everything Leslie Nielson does has been hilarious, and this series is one of my favorites. I needed this one to complete the set. Found it in good condition at a good price here and bought it."
5,THIS ONE IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST!!,This movie is just what my tital says!! Just as good as the first and that's because it is!! If you like the first one than you'll love this one too!!
4,A perfect last 1/2 hour,"Like the Mike Judge film, Office Space, this movie has about a half hour that can be watched over and over again, while still being funny. As soon as Frank Drebin (Leslie Neilson) sneaks into the Oscars, hilarity ensues. That last half hour has proven to be a welcome break on many occasions."
2,A Disappointing Sequel,"For all its potential, ""Naked Gun 2 1/2"" is nothing more than a weak retread of the original. One would think that changing the setting from LA to DC would enhance the comedic aspects of this film but unfortunately, the writers were unable to CAPITALize on this change of venue. Although there are some good gags and political satire throughout the film, the characters, especially Drebin, seem to be out of their element which makes for a rather flat performance. Yes, ""Naked Gun 2 1/2"" has its moments but for the most part, this is a dull and otherwise forgettable movie. You may want to rent this video only if you can get it as part of a two-for-one special at Blockbuster."
4,"Great flick, but missing a classic scene on DVD....","After the success of ""The Naked Gun"", a sequal was immediately written. After a three year interval, Drebin and Police Squad returned. The film is somewhat slow, and is definately not as good as the first. It does have some hysterical sequences and I was surprised when one was left out. When Frank and Quentin confront each other near the end, Quentin never tells Frank to stand ""over there"". Frank then answers ""...where?"" Quentin becomes distracted and points the gun to the wall. Frank takes it from him and Quentin repeats this routine on Frank. This scene appears on VHS but must have been left on the DVD cutting room floor....."
4,"Very funny, but over-the-top at times","This movie is very, very funny. But there are some jokes that go soaring over the top. Like, I wish I could laugh at the idea of O.J. Simpson being dragged through town by a city bus, but I just couldn't shake off the feeling that I felt so sorry for him. And making the bad guy explode by locking a fire hose in his mouth was both disgusting and very disturbing at the same time. But besides that, this movie has funny all over it, especially the ending. And I laughed harder at the credits than I laughed throughout the movie, especially the George Bush sound bite at the very end of the credits. So in short, see this movie, just don't see the either heart-wrenching, disturbing, or disgusting jokes that bumped this movie off the 5-star mark."
4,SPERMS OF ENDEARMENT,"Originally a half-hour sitcom, POLICE SQUAD was hilarious and formed quite a good basis for the movies that followed. If there's anyone to blame for this not being quite as good as its predecessors, it could be the director Peter Segal. There are so many wonderful gags in this one, but Segal didn't capitalize on the sight gags that go on behind the scenes, except for a hilarious Jurassic park dinosaur behind one of the closed doors at the police station. But Leslie Nielsen and Priscilla Presley are so delightfully hammy and they carry the movie. Fred Ward and Kathleen Freeman are quite good too as the bomber and his ma. This movie has lots and lots of laughs and the climax at the Oscar awards is superb. Watching OJ Simpson isn't as fun as it was before he received his notoriety in his wife's murder. Another extremely good spoof is the opening rip off of THE UNTOUCHABLES. It's great."
5,A GRRRREEEAAATTT Flick!,GREAT! This is Fantastic! It is so funny. Its romantic in a funny kind of way. Somethings you don't see often in real life. Buy this movie! YOU WON'T REGRET IT! I PROMISE YOU THAT! Spose to be a VHS.
5,HE HAS THE SHAPE OF WHISTLER'S MOTHER ON HIS RIGHT BUTTOCK,This movie is extremely funny. I may be over doing it but this MOVIE IS BETTER THAN SOUTH PARK or AUSTIN POWERS. This movie is too good to be true. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HATE THIS MOVIE! THE GHOST PARODY CLAYPOT SCENE. THE GUY EXPLODING! OJ SIMPSON GETTING CAUGHT UNDER THE CARS! THIS IS FUNNY AND YOUR LAUGHING EVERY SECOND. FROM START TO END! DAVID AND JERRY ZUCKER DO MORE OF THESE PARODIES THEY ARE SO FUNNY!
3,The Naked Gun 33 1/3 - The Final Insult,"The Naked Gun 33 1/3 - The Final Insult~ Raye Birk is not nearly as good as the prior 2 movies. The script has its moments like the babies in the courtroom and the scene with the burning LA in the background. However, many of the jokes seem very familiar and are not as funny the third time around. Luckily they realized that the jokes were starting to run thin they did not make a fourth movie. An alright movie but nothing more."
4,Some very funny parts,"Though this sequel largely parallels the plot of the first and is quite predictable (which doesn't really matter), there are some very funny moments.Like the original, the humor in this film is of the extremely immature/poopy-pants/people getting hurt variety, which I happen to find very amusing. I imagine it would appeal more to teenagers and to men than to adults and to women, but I could be wrong.Recommended if you enjoyed the original."
3,Celia sings in heaven,"I must say that I thought this album would be put together in a more pleasant way. Some of the tracks are tracks Celia didn't want released at the time of recording, and although she sings great on them, the tracks sound more like rehearsal cuts. The rest are songs as a tribute to her, some of them have her singing in the background, and although pleasant, i find it strange to hear a song about her death, with her in the background. In all, a good CD for posterity's sake, but I see why Celia didn't want these released when she recorded them."
1,I would rather switch by hand.,"This Product sucks. It doesn't like the signal from my upconverting lg recorder so it sends a signal that turns my tv off. From my computer, it flashes between black and the computer screen. I wouldn't buy it, in fact, I didn't by it, I bought a 4 in 1 and they sent this 5 in 1 hdmi spliter. What a deal huh?"
4,The Heart of Man,I have not completely read the book yet. I am certain it is everything I expected it to be. Came highly recommended and plan to finish. Just haven't had time.
3,"Mostly gossip, somewhat repetitive, and a little biased.","The book is very readable - I finished it in one day, and rather enjoyed it. The material is mostly gossipy, which makes for easy and fun reading.The book's gossipy character makes it somewhat shallow.Each chapter centers around one major character. This way the events' time line is hidden, and many events are mentioned several times in different chapters.As the book tells more about the events than the people themselves, I think breaking the material by person only confuses the book needlessly.I recommend this book for people who are interested in the people behind the order, and not in the order history or order materials."
2,oddly filmsy,I would expect better quality considering the brand and previous items purchased from them. They are just not what was expected.
1,Not powerful,My bike light went out and I replaced the Toshiba batteries with these. The light didn't work. These are weak batteries and for bike lights don't use them.
1,SEWAGE,Ask the next Iraq vet you meet if Over There has any connection to reality. Bochco doesn't have any real military advisement on this project and clearly is not consulting groups of iraq vets for accuracy in story. This series reeks of fantasy profiteering or an outright agenda. Not sure which is worse.
2,"Terrible First Episode, Very Good Series","The first episode is stunningly bad, which makes it surprising how the subsequent episodes are uniformly excellent.Episode 2 - ""Roadblock Duty"" - ExcellentDepicts how terrorists are using civilians as human shields, and also hiding terrorists and bombs in vehicle trunks.Episode 3 - ""The Prisoner"" - ExcellentAggressive interrogation techniques, to the early dismay of a wimpy soldier, yield important intelligence that saves US lives.Episode 4 - Didn't see this oneEpisode 5 - ""Embedded"" - ExcellentThis episode dealt with 'jihadists' setting up US troops in a small town, by intentionally using a little boy as bait (making him run at the troops). The 'jihadists' had also pre-positioned cameras, to film the child they had killed, which the willing ""mainstream"" media accomplices replayed over and over, providing a propaganda coup for the terrorists."
1,Over There - Too Much Of A Fantasy,"As someone who served in the first Gulf War in 1991, I saw a portion of FX's ""Over There"" and for a network with hits like ""The Shield"", ""Nip/Tuck"" and ""Rescue Me"", this is a big strikeout.This looks too phony and Hollywoodish for the conssumate TV viewer. Remember this saying: Viewer Beware!"
3,Over There,"The series is somehwhat realistic, if not slightly ""Hollywoodized."" I have been deployed to the Middle East on several occasions, and the situations are somewhat realistic. Some individuals who write reviews talk about politics, instead of the movie. I am referring to a review from an individual from Iran. All I will say is that I can't believe that someone would think that NO ONE in the middle east has a problem with Americans, only with our goverment. So, Mr. Iran, please take out your frustrations on the people that send us ""over there"", not the troops who are ordered to do a job. Most of us come over here, want to do our job, stay alive, and go home to our families. Please take your ""views"" to other mediums. The last thing I will say is that if you buy this to experience a ""realistic to the T deployment,"" don't, enlisting might be a better option."
1,"BEWARE: 2.0 AUDIO ONLY, NO SURROUND!","For some reason, this disc only has 2.0 Dolby audio, where the same pilot episode on the box set has 5.1 surround."
4,Wish they never cancelled it.,"I am in the Army myself, and thought this was a great series. I don't know why they cancelled it.Anyhow, the first few episodes are my favorite, but later in the series they begin to stray from what made it so good. However, towards the end of the series they make it interesting again. I wish they never canceled the show; I prefer it over the Unit."
5,I love Over There,"I am the wife of a Major in the Army Reserves who is currently in Iraq with a Special Ops unit. My husband will have been in for 22 years this December. I know this show is dramatized (duh) because if it showed what my husband does the majority of the time, it would be paperwork and meetings. But I do think that the show reflects aspects of Iraqi culture that many Americans have no idea about. Each event depicted in the show is in itself realistic. Sure, all that wouldn't happen to one detachment, but I don't want to be that bored. It is one of the few military programs I have seen that addresses the problems of the families that deployed soldiers leave behind. I am very conservative, but don't see the show as that liberal leaning. If it discriminates in any way, it makes officers look terrible, but my husband would agree with the fact that there are a lot of bad officers. I am addicted and can't wait for season 2!"
5,This CD is FIERCE!,"This CD is packed with 'classic' Circuit Party music... Everyday by Kim English, Rapture by Iio, Running by Information Society, Heartbreak by Friburn & Urik, La La Land by Green Velvet, Jonesing by Circuit Boy feat. Alan T, Hide U by Suzanne Palmer, Your Mind by Xzique, Musica Electrica by Alma Matris, I'm Addicted by Pusaka pres. Thea Austin, My Imagination by Ceevox, and Derb by Derb. Those tracks are true Circuit songs, and are still played in clubs and at Circuit parties. I played this CD at two parties recently and at both it got people up and dancing for hours... if that doen't mean it's an awesome CD, I don't know what it means! I listen to this CD all the time, it gets me up and going for the day, or hyped before going to a club or party!"
4,IT'S WHAT YOU'D EXPECT,"This is exactly whats been played in ""the circuit"" for months prior and after this CD's release date.I can't wait to see Tracy at the White Party!!"
2,Party ? Not to this surely....,"Bought this while on holiday in the States (from UK). Very disappointing, in fact dull as dishwater. Basic mixing skills (some tracks just die away into the intro of the next), uninspired track selections, and hardly likely to raise a sweat on the dancefloor. There are some cool tracks - Kim English ""Everyday"", Suzanne palmer ""Hide U"", Green Velvet ""La La Land"". But no sense of build up on either CD. Why so many people seem impressed by this lady (to judge by the info on the inset) is beyond me. Hopefully not just because she's one of the few girls on the circuit."
2,Endlessly repetitious...uninspiring,"This CD looks somewhat promising, but proves to be a bit of a disappointment. Some of the tracks are excellent, but they are few and far between, always separated by 7 minute mixes that have no substance (a bunch of beats punctuated with house diva hey's and ho's). It's completely unlistenable in a club and even worse at home. This CD seems to bring together a lot of the filler on a maxi-single and put it on one collection. ..."
4,Early Dottie Tracks Make This of Interest for Fans,"These the first recordings Dottie West cut from 1959 to 1962 a few years before she became a charting artist. ""Angel on Paper"" was her first single release and she covers some of the major female country hits of the day, Patsy Cline's ""I Fall to Pieces"" and ""Crazy"", Kitty Wells' ""Heartbreak USA"", and Skeeter Davis' ""The Hand You're Holding Now"". These tracks were later packaged as a vinyl album at least three times 1965-1982 and now have made it to CD. Dottie's voice seems a bit timid at times and she seems to be more interested in singing smoothly rather than from her heart, a couple of tracks scarcely sound like her and some of the songs are not so great. But there is some very nice stuff here, notably her wistful ""I Should Start Running"" and the spirited ""Men With Evil Hearts"". These tracks can't compare to her great hits but it's nice to have them still around so we can listen to this great artist in her earliest stages."
3,NOT THAT GREAT,"I am a big Salif Keita Fan and I've been following his music for the last 6 years. I know most people are not going to agree with this but M'Bemba is my least favorite album from all his collections. In my opinion the only song that stands out on this album is track # 2 "" Leban"" which I think is one of his best songs ever. I still believe "" Folon....the Past"" is his greatest work ever."
5,TWELVE OF ELVIS'S TWENTY BEST EVER,"As an Elvis fan for a generation, I truly consider his best work was when singing love songs. This album has 12 of the best 20 of these of all time. ""First in Line"" is so amazingly haunting and worth buying the album just to listen to. Others of the 20 to look out for are ""Young and Beautiful"" and ""Young Love"" as well as the almost impossible to find ""Judi"" (which I used to play when serenading my wife)!!"
1,Bead cart,This item started falling apart as soon as I got it. I tried keeping parts of it for my beads but ended up tossing the whole thing.
3,A bit problematic still.,Pros:Large bright screen.Camera is a cool idea.Compact.Loud speaker.Cons:It doesn't have the new day light savings time.Camera quality is worse then my cell phone.Map updates cost more then others.Customer service is questionable and the US market does seem like the company's main concern.
4,Navman N60i,Nice navigation system overall. Large screen a must. Could have a little more versatile mounting device.
2,Rather silly,"I thought this would be a fun, quirky read, but was very disappointed. The premise was weak, the characters were not well developed, and the dialogue was even worse. Almost everyone's behavior was appalling - from parents who curse their children and can't over it for more than 3,000 years, to other parents who hide in plain sight from their ""orphaned"" children. By the end, I no longer cared whether Darius remained a statue or not."
3,Corny but Cute,"Forget what you know about world history, forget what you know about greek mythology. Done? Ok, now you can enjoy 'A Greek God at the Ladies Club'.Well, for the most part. It's corny. VERY corny. And there's a lot going on that's never really resolved, or if it is it's wrapped up too quickly to be satisfying.However, you will laugh. I cracked up whenever Darius turned into a statue (sitting on the toilet, with his finger up his nose, etc.) and the Greek Gods were very modern, reminding me of the Gods of 'Xena: Warrior Princess'It could have been better, but if you just want something fun to take to the beach it's worth it."
2,A Greek God named Darius???,"I thought this was an interesting idea (a new take on ""One Touch of Venus,"" sort of) but the author showed a real lack of understanding of Greek mythology and even Greek NAMES. Her hero is named Darius? That's obviously Latin, plus she had a Greek king named Edward. Edward! You know, like Edmund, Edgar, Edwin, and all those Old English names. Why not Gawain and Uther Pendragon on Mount Olympus! It just isn't that hard to find a baby name book and look for Greek names or pick up a children's book about Greek mythology. I know the names are a minor point, but it really took me out of the story right off the start. In general, the author was good with the humor but not so good with dialogue (not enough dialogue for one thing) and not very good at characterization. The plot got kind of hokey and the epilogue specifically was a silly idea."
2,Predictable,"I always look for books that involve Greek and Roman gods/goddesses and was anticipating this book as a light read. Well, it was a heavy book in that it kept falling to the bottom of my reading pile, buried under other, more worthwhile books. I would start and read a few pages, put it away and forget about it, then looking for something to read, find it and start again. The female heroine never came alive to me at all. We never learned enough of her psychological or emotional backstory to make her current behavior interesting. It was patently obvious early on who the missing father was going to be and that subplot added nothing the story esp when the sisters accept their father's failure to identify himself with no more than a shrug. The sections on Mt. Olympus were almost painfully trite, e.g. Zeus controls the weather with a computer. In the end, it was just not a very interesting book and I finished it only because I had grabbed it to read while on a plane trip."
5,Quirky but memorable,"I have the 1968 version, which I read in 1968. It was originally published in France in 1930. It's the story of two brothers who fall into a secret underground world, which consists of two countries--the land of Fattypuffs and the land of Thinifers. Fattypuffs are fat, their cars and boats are round, they are very jolly. Thinifers are thin, live in tall, thin buildings, and are workaholics. For the two brothers who discover this place, they learn that Fattypuffs and Thinifers hate each other, so the brothers try to help them become friends.I remember it fondly, although it is politically incorrect these days. A quaint read, with great illustrations by Fritz Wegner."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A kid's book, of the farcical variety.A couple of pompous social organisations - which, as you can tell by the title, are divided by body type, get to mess around and antagonise each other and generally be silly doofuses. One of those cases were nobody is right, and they disagree because they can and they sort of enjoy it into the bargain.All pretty entertaining for the kid types, really."
2,NOOOOO...,"The item that I brought in the page said that is the correct for my car, I order and when I received the Item don't FIT to my car,the cables was very short to put in the correct side. I return the item and to today's date I don't received the refund."
2,Disappointment,"I was so disappointed in this book. It had such potential as a hearwarming story, but it turned into a ""poor me"" story about how hard the Indians had it. I, too, lived through the 1964 flood on Birch Creek and I have a totally different view of the devastation the flood caused. I felt it was a time that all the people gathered together to help one another and look for so many missing people.The part in the story about finding the colt was so good. The author should have spend more time writing about that."
1,Slapstick Comedy,"The book starts out well enough, but became tiresome about a quarter of the way through. Although the plot is clever and lively at the start, ""Wolfgang's"" constant !!! use of bizarre oaths (e.g., ""Satan's small clothes,"" ""By Satan's Pointed Tail,"" ""Lucifer's Cloven Hoof"" - to name but a few) really became annoying after a while and got in the way of the story. Also, Lord Melboure's dialog written to demonstrate his exagerated lisp (which at times was difficult to decipher) also interrupted the flow of the story. Last but not least, the silly bedroom scene on the inevitable wedding night (I skipped ahead), complete with a jealous cat and Irish Wolfhound, was a bit much to believe.I notice that other readers really liked this book, so perhaps I was looking for something different. Nonetheless, I prefer to like the main characters and found that difficult in this case."
4,The Wolf of Her Dreams,"Wolfgang Hardwicke, the Earl of Northcliffe, has met his match with Grizelda Fleetwood. He sees the tall, well formed lady and sets his sights to seduce her to his bed. Being an opinionated, bluestocking woman, she doesn't surrender to the game. I liked these two characters who try to outwit the other in tactics. The chase is on, so to speak, to see who surrenders first. The author did a fine job on keeping the pace with clever innuendos and hot scenes."
4,The name's a turn-off!,"I liked this book, but it really took me a while to get past the heroine's name. Grizelda--Zel. That has to be the most unattractive name I've run across in a romance. Usually the heroines have such lovely names. I'm assuming this was intentional, but I had a hard time getting a picture of an old, dowdy maiden aunt out of my head everytime I pictured ""Zel"". You can pick unusual names, just not ugly ones."
4,A great compilation of Terry's early work!,"A nice selection of tracks from Terry's first two records.A great place to start if you don't have any of his early stuff, or if you've heard the name but have never listened to his music. If you like bluesy, soulful, British rock,(Steve Marriott comes to mind)you won't be disappointed. ""River"" and ""Seeds of Memory"" should also be on you're shopping list."
4,"The man was offered the lead singing job in Led Zeppellin before Plant, How bad can he be?",Really this is a pretty good album. It has all the markings of white boy blues. He's got a set of superlungs and knows how to use them. He's also a pretty good guitar player. The most interesting aspect to this CD is that you'll recognize a number of the songs. I own other Terry Reid CDs and really like them but their more acoustic and less blues. This is a charged up CD with some killer songs. So killer that other bands recorded them and made them famous. Poor Mr. Reid has been ignored for to long. Go ahead and give the man some recogniztion: buy the album.
3,Help is on the way,"I was hit by ""Help is on the way"" back in 1981 when it was new. Not until 20 years later I was downloading old school soul/funk and came across the song by chance. I had never heard of the Whatnauts but the recording was released by Harlem Records, 1981. It is a great song with a newer sound than some of the samples on this site. Same style as Fat Larry's Band's 'Act like you know'. Great message: 'Mama never said life would be easy... Help is on the way. All you've got to do is pray."" Soulful lyrics but funky enough to make you shake."
5,Very Sturdy Table for a Low Price!,"I bought this Meco Samsonite Chicory Square Folding Table to use as a make-shift desk. I wanted a portable desk to put in the living room so I could work on my laptop while watching television. I love that I can fold it up when it's not in use. That's something you can't do with a regular desk.I paid around $35 for this card table. It was one of the best purchases that I've made this year. I've gotten a ton of use out of it already.It's very good quality. It's sturdy and looks great. It's just perfect for what I wanted it for.I highly recommend this card table. It's inexpensive, but very well-made."
2,Not up for the flight,"American-retro Pretty In Pink Pedal AirplaneThis airplane was given to our daughter for her 2nd birthday. Although an adorable gift that she was so excited to ride, it just did not hold up to expectations. It can not be pedaled for one thing because you can not steer it. It is a big and bulky toy that is now parked in her room. Not really what they giver had in mind. Also, the steering wheel comes off rather easily and the screws that hold it in place (or do not hold in place) can be a choking hazard. Cute concept, but still needs more work."
3,life story has potential,"Dr. Grenfell's story of his missionary work to help fishermen in Labrador has possibility for great personal adventure, but his autobio evolves into a narrative of his strong Christian beliefs in improving conditions for the inhabitants and his crusades against alcohol in Labrador. A small irritant for me was his tendency to ""name names"" of his donors and supporters throughout the story. I enjoy biography and adventure, so the location and people enticed me to finish the book. From his book, Dr. Grenfell obviously did excellent work throughout his life, appeared to be broadminded about religion, was clear about the harm alcohol abuse wreaked on the poor Labrador families and communities, and seemed humble about his accomplishments. His narrative is weakened by his failure to capture the details and essense of the real people fishing and living in the harsh Labrador climate in the late 19th and early 20th centuries."
2,lots of helpful info...but poor illustrations of technique!,"i agree with most of the reviews...i did find it helpful in casting on and the basic knit stitch, but anything else is an enigma...seems as if you have to know the movements beforehand and the whole reason i bought this book was to LEARN THEM!!! i thought it would help me with a project i took on, but i ended up seeking help from a yarn store owner and any other book i could find with illustrations!! a good reference probably once you already know what you're doing, but find something else if you are a true beginner!!"
3,Puzzled,"I was going to rate this book with 5 stars. The illustrations are fine with me, and I like the step-by-step instructions. I like not having to make 5 afghans in order to learn 4 techniques. BUT, I think there are some typos, and I can't find a single website that will allow me to report the typos or to see if anyone else has reported the typos. Since I'm a beginning knitter, I really need some way of checking on the accuracy of the information"
