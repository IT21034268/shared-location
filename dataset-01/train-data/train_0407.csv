1,Find a Better Style Guide,"What is this book offering? Surely not a true vision of Internet design. As someone who has been doing design for many years I find this book lacking, to be kind. Design IS easy - once you understand that the designer is the driving force behind creating fluid, exciting layouts and design elements. And with the changing technology of the Internet, this book is behind the times. Web designers do yourself a favor - take what you learn and push the envelope - have an opinion of your own."
1,This book is terrible,Style guide? For who? If you feel that this book is the best thing to happen to web design since the GIF then maybe you shouldn't be creating pages online. This book is absolutly terrible.
3,Web Style Guide : Basic Design Principles for,"I like this book, but I am a student, I don't have much money."
4,"Solid, direct, & deliberately focused","Hardcore designers won't like this book, as they usually don't like readability or usability studies. It is a valuable basic reference for business designers for whom the point is clarity and usability, not cutting-edge design. It is valuable for starting a Web project to set the ground rules upon which design is built. I highly recommend it. Use it to avoid building another of the thousands of really bad Websites."
4,PRETTY CONCISE AND HELPFUL...,"...far from being the last word in web design, but as a web developer, I found it pretty useful. I thought this book did a pretty good job of talking about some pretty important topics, like the site development process, and then clued me in on some graphic design concepts (like lossy versus lossless compression, and the differences between a JPEG and a GIF image). I would use this as a secondary reference, and keep ""Web Design in a Nutshell"" as a primary reference. Still worth the read, though."
3,"Not the Best, but still worth it","There are better design guides out there but this one is still worth reading. The authors make some good points, especially if you are someone who doesn't have a print design background. However, there were times that they contradicted themselves. There were even more times that I (a web designer of 4 years) disagreed with them. While some of the tips and techniques they mention DO work, they are not always the best thing to do. Don't read this book thinking that it is THE guide for designing web sites. It will definitely help you, but check out other stuff too."
4,Web Style Guide,"After initially getting the incorrect book, when I contacted them, they made it right immediately. They sent my book express mail the second time at no cost to me due to their mistake."
4,Book doing a good job in sumaring what a website should do to work,"Although obviously too basic for web developers and people working on the Net day-in-day-out because of its simplification of web design, it does work as a complete sumary of what a sucessful website should have in design terms for anyone who would like to get started at a serious level. It does a pretty good job at doing precisely that and little else, but its clarity helps to simplify and put all the necessary pieces into perspective. It makes pretty good emphasis in Accesibility which I find it is a very important thing to always remember when designing for the whole WWW without leaving anyone behind. Easy and fast to read, it will give you a good bird's eye view before getting started designing your website."
2,Where's the guide!,"If you're looking for a ""Web Style Guide"" make one yourself. This one isn't it.Although there are many good points sprinkled throughout this skinny guide, it's over-academic approach makes this about as interesting to read as the phone book. There are far too many ""you must"" and ""you must not""'s to make this book credible as a design guide. Skip to their web site and save yourself some money... Where's their web site URL? Well right on the cover, of course!"
2,Skip It if You're Serious about Web Design,"In short, after examining the Web site which is the basis of this book, I concluded that the book would not be helpful. The authors base their instruction on Web design primarily on books focused exclusively on print design. The Web is not print! They do mention a few good Web oriented tips, but you can get those in other Web design books which are truly Web design books. Furthermore, I was glad to see that they acknowledge CSS at least, but in truth, CSS is far more important to Web design than these uppitty Ivy-league professors let you know. Essentially, the book is a complete wash: mark it as useless, and move on!"
2,Doesn't deliver,"Perhaps if you're new to the internet (and new to web design & practical web application) this book can work for you. But for the rest of us this book is not useful or practical. The design applications are too basic, outdated. Where's the market/trend information? All the relevant information about PC harware that would allow for a complete retrospect for creating a successful web page? This book makes promises that it doesn't deliver. Not the best guide for successful corporate pages."
1,There's better styles guides out there,"Not to be confused with a real style guide used by graphic designers and web masters, this book should not be used even as a basis of what web desgin should be."
4,Clean and concise,"Another excellent book that even practices everything that is mentioned for designing for the web. For those who feel that this book lacked cutting-edge information, go find it on your own because it's out there."
5,"Clear, practical, and intelligent!","If there is one book on web design I'd recommend above all others, it's this one. It speaks to everyone. Technical experts will appreciate how it unlocks creativity and provides fresh insight to web possibilities. Non-tech people like me will breathe a sigh of relief to discover how enjoyable the ""nuts and bolts"" of web construction can be. You'll be recommending it, too!"
4,Great book for starters!,"I recommend this book to anyone who is a designer for the web or publishing industry. I bought this book to start as a class requirement. I didn't know what to expect at first, but as I was reading through the book I found this book to be very helpful. It really covers all areas of basic design and it's useful for all designers, especially for starters. The fundamentals of design is universal and in the book, it explains how design concepts have been around for a long time like in the publishing industry and how it's carried over to the web now. Learn the concepts so that you too can be a sophisticated designer."
1,Pass this one by,"Having read this book, then the reviews for it, I'm pretty dismayed by the division between graphic designers and web masters. As a developer and a programer for the Internet, I find this book to be unreasonable and, frankly, dated; the information stored within is a poor example of what can and should be accomplished on the Internet. How sad that there are people so new to the web that they are blinded by the limits of this book. This is not about hard-core designers creating complicated web pages; this is about reaching all Internet visitors by using functional pages and leading edge technology to capture an audience. And this book just doesn't bring that to life."
1,Where's the 'deep principles of design'?,"This book gives you neither deep principles of design or classic web style design. Limited, binding, and totally unrealistic, this book does not prepare new designers for the reality of working in the ever changing world of the Internet.With technology and design working hand in hand these days, having a 'guide' that forces creativity to be limited will cause a tug of war between making 'safe' designs and making marketable designs that bring in customers. Web pages made with this book will be static and uninteresing. No, I'm not saying that a designer should throw in fancy graphics and hard core, flashy animation or any thing like that. But a 'dead' page is not going to get people to notice your company. Worse still, who in this day and age is going to take a company seriously that has a sloppy web site that looks like an 8th grader did it? Because if you use this book for designing your site, that's what its going to look like."
1,Don't Be Fooled!,"Don't be fooled by the title of this book! It's not a style guide for the web. Its based on paper collateral designs and principles and it can not be applied to the real world.If I were to use this book when creating web sites, I would be the laughing stock of the company. Want to make stylish sites that don't bog down viewers browsers? Take a design class but DON'T pick up this book."
3,Not too helpful...,"If you're fairly inexperienced on the internet, and you don't know what ""Classic three-column layout"" means, then you should buy this book. If you do know what that means, you are probably familiar with the majority of the topics covered in this book. I did not find that the time I spent reading this was well spent because it is very basic. Don't expect too much magic to come off the pages."
2,a big disapointment,Wow what a disapointment this book was. Poor use of images and text and bad advice on how to arrange it all that you'll find here. I know that there are better guides on web page design out there.
1,PRO TOENAIL CLIPPER,BLADES VERY DULL. CANNOT CLOSE AFTER USE AS CLOSER IS DEFECTIVE.BARELY CAN CLIP FINGER NAILS.RETURNING ITEM AS SOON AS I RETURN FROM VACATION.
3,another good book,This is a book in teh prescription:marriage series. I found it to be the best book in teh series. It is about an average woman who actually attracts prince charming and she turns him down. Of course he is persistent until finally she decides to go out with him. When he decides to make a commitment though she is the one who isn't sure if it is time. In this book instead of the man being afraid on commitment it is teh woman. this was a great way to spend a cold snowy day.
4,English Translation of Calmaldolese Monastic History,"Aside from the writings of Fr. Thomas Matus (an American monk at the Monastero di Camaldoli in Arezzo, Italy) this is the only English text I am aware of which introduces readers to the rich and interesting history of St. Romuald (11th century Italian hermit) and the saintly men and women who developed Camaldolese monastic spirituality. This historical work provides the reader with a better appreciation of the spiritual roots of a remarkable religious order whose charism uniquely combines the silent and contemplative life with the missionary mandate to be Christ grounded among all peoples. Until the founding of New Camaldoli at Big Sur, California in 1958, Camaldolese spirituality, though practiced in Italy for the last nine centuries, was virtually unknown in the United States. The last four decades however has seen its monastic fruits ripen in American soil."
4,"Functions great, ok comfort","These are fairly comfortable shoes right from the first time I put them on. They have good support and cushiony insoles.They keep my feet dry in the rain or wet grass, and have decent grip on wet/slick surfaces. Both of these things were important qualities that I looked for when shopping for a shoe, and so far the shoe has delivered.They are not casual shoes, but they are not quite formal either. They are perhaps business casual. Unlike some of the other Rockport work shoes, these do not have a visible label or insignia printed on the shoe.The only shortcoming is that they have a slightly plastic-like feel and look to them. I mean that the outer material is harder than normal, so that when the shoe bends at the toe region, it noticeably constricts my toes. This property has not gone away with time.Update: The toe constriction is gone now (3-4 months) that the shoes are broken in. Also, the grip and water resistance are great in the icy winter."
5,"Artichoke Extract, The Real Thing","This is real artichoke extract which is supposed to have good health properties including liver cleanse and lower cholesterol. It's a powerful spray. It goes down like a shot of tequilla, warm, spicy, tasy. On those cold nights or really anytime, this is a great product."
2,misunderstood,I misunderstood what this product was supposed to do. I was told that it was an appetite suppressor and that was the reason that I purchased it but it did do that for me in the least little bit.
1,Not for the average reader looking for good reading.,"If all you want is to write about how many songs Gordon MacRae has sung or what the names of the films are that he's been in, then this book is for you. However, if your looking for his story to be told with some emotion, or some of Gordons own remembrances,this is a waste of money.Written in a way that is dry as dust! Jumps from one subject to another so that you're left hanging. Terrible reading. Very few pages of his story, and all the rest is documentation.Not many photos."
4,Great pictures!,I just like the quiet and pictures of the scenery- It is a nice change when the weather gets gray and damp!
1,Very disappointed. Not very beachy. It's more like animal planet.,"I just wanted a relaxing beach scene video but this is not what I got; it's more like animal planet.The other blu-ray called ""Hawaii Beaches1"" in blu-ray is way better at 5 stars."
1,Read the book instead,"Robert Franklin Leslie must have been embarassed to have his name associated with this Disney film! After reading the book, I was so excited to see that a movie had been made and was still available on Amazon. What a disappointment! The script and acting were lame. Don't waste your money. Read the book instead; it's wonderful.John Denver's song is the only redeeming part of the movie, and you can hear him sing it on CD's."
3,"Great scenery, Cute bears, Wholesome viewing.",This was a nice cheerful family film with great scenery and cute bears. The plot was a bit predictable though and the acting was rather canned. Still overall I think our family enjoyed it although I don't think I would watch it again I think my children would enjoy a repeat viewing.A Concerned Christian Mom
5,Lastolite Reflector/Diffuser,I really haven't used this yet. It arrived in great condition and is compact with it's case. I thought it was more of a reflector (like one with the silver side) than it looks like. To me it looks more like a diffuser. I would have to have another person hold it for me since I didn't get a stand. Hope to use it soon to see the difference it makes in the photos.
4,Lively and accurate.,"I found the book very handy during my visit to Belize. Even when it was not 100% accurate it was not wrong.Furthermore it conveyed more of the spirit of the place than any other guide I red. In fact it makes a pleasant reading, even if you are visiting another country! Useful index at the back."
4,"Very Helpful food photography bible, but too much info on choosing cameras!","I am definitely enjoying reading this book and have found it extremely helpful to my own food photography learning curve, but I found that Lou's choice to put so much info in the beginning about actually choosing your dSLR was absolutely unnecessary and a waste of space. I can't imagine a newbie photographer being at the point of doing food photography if they didn't even possess a camera yet, so I wish more space had been used for simple instruction. Other than that, the book is great with lots of examples and info on food-styling etc, etc--thanks Lou!"
5,"Thank You, Lou!","Five stars and congratulations to Lou Manna for producing one of the best photography books on the market today! It was a pleasure to devour this book in two days. I am an aspiring food photographer who finds the information in this book not only invaluable and comprehensive re: the digital medium, but also an extensive review of photographic principles in general. The photographs are beautifully reproduced, so the reader can really 'see' what points he is making. The business and marketing chapter at the end of the book is especially helpful to anyone making a serious stab into the profession. I will use this book again and again. Thank you, Lou!"
3,Beginning Food Photography,"I was a little dissapointed in the content of Digital Food Photography. The book, layed out in textbook style, is a little basic for the complexity of the subject. Mr. Manna spends too much time on the ""old days"" and takes too long to dive in to the meat of food photography. It would have been helpful to show specs of each shot; ie camera, lights, exposure, etc. Instead there is a lighting 101 class in the book that does little for the example shots shown. Overall though it's a great book to add to your basic arsenal of photography books."
5,Great Intro to Food Photography,"As a semi-pro moving into commercial work I found this book very useful to explore my interests in food photography. The text was well organized and covered items specific to this genre of photography very thoroughly. ""Digital Food Photography"" presents a comprehensive look at all aspects from tips and tricks, styling and lighting, to business, data management, and marketing concerns. Especially well done was the lighting comparisons demonstrating the various effects of different types of lighting. Definitely a must have for anyone interested in getting started in or improving upon their food photography."
1,"Great for amateurs, but not for professional photogs.","This book seems to get overall good scoring, so i'll be somewhat contrarian here, and mark it down, simply because it should specify if the book is for amateurs or professionals.Whilst it's all you need to get going in food photography if you're beginner to photography, it is of no help to professionals."
4,A Good Read but Wanted More Detail,"I really enjoyed this book, especially the photographs. I would have liked to have seen more detail, however. For example, the author talks about using macro and telephoto lenses. I wanted to know which lenses, focal lengths, apertures, etc. were used to produce the photographs."
3,"Missing some info, bit dated with other info","I wish this book stuck to food photography specifically and went into a bit more detail in some areas. In particular, I would have liked to have seen lighting diagrams for the images and a more in depth discussion of how he lit some of his shots, rather than what gear he used.The book has chapters that are more about photography in general than food photography in particular. If you are just starting out, perhaps this extra info is helpful. As technology marches forward unabated, it is not surprising that a book written a few years ago has some out of date information, which is a pity, because the core of what Lou Manna talks about when we gets specific to the food photography is more timeless.He gives good attention to styling and props, but ultimately I found myself disappointed that I didn't get more from this book."
5,Excellent book,"I am just only beginner in Food photography, and Lou Manna have taught me through the book in few days. It is absolutely excellent book because It will take you step by step how to take food photos, what lighting to use umbrella or soft box, what aperture to use and etc. Every food photographer question is covered in this book. You will learn how to work with food stylist, and few secrets how to keep the food fresh during photo shoot. I believe that all of us photographers looking for all this details and questions, and Lou Manna has answers for you.I highly recommended this book for every food photographer. The book has journalist style, and it is easy to read and follow it."
4,The Donald Duck Book,"ISBN 0307689115 - Shaped like Donald's head, this short book is really more about Donald's nephews than Donald - a potential letdown for Donald fans.Readers are introduced to Donald and his nephews and then follow Huey, Dewey and Louie through a day of play, ending with a nap. Makes a nice naptime story. The illustrations are, as with almost all Disney, bright and colorful; the text is short and fairly simple for beginners.- AnnaLovesBooks"
5,Cats Rule!,This book was given to me as a gift and after reading it I promptly bought 4 from Amazon to give as gifts for the holidays. The author has truly captured her cat's essence. It's beautifuly written and tells just how much love a cat needs and gives. I highly recommend this book.
5,A Wonderful Book,"This book, The Fur Person, by May Sarton, was well packaged and arrived at my home within the time frame specified. It was a gift to a relative, so its timely arrival was important. I have been an Amazon customer for a long time, and I would gladly recommend its services to my friends. This book is a treasure, and hard to find."
4,"Great music, flawed lyrics, too many guests","Gang Starr's ""The Ownerz"" is simultaneously brilliant and flawed. On the majority of songs, the music is done very well (see ""Put Up or Shut Up,"" ""Rite Where You Stand"" and ""Capture""). Lyrically, Guru composes some great lyrics, but for some unexplained reason he still insists on railing on corporations.""The Ownerz"" main flaw is the guest rappers. There are atleast 12 of them, and with exception of Krum, Big Shugg and Freddie Foxx, the rest are sometimes painful to listen to. Finally, while some songs are well worth the whole CD, there are atleast 4 that can be considered ""filler"" (see ""Intro,"" which tries to be philosophical but fails, ""Werdz,"" ""Who Got Gunz"" and ""Hiney"" which is incomprehensible and ridiculous). Overall, this is a good album, but any fan knows that Gang Starr could have done better."
2,Gang Starr should have retired on top.,"I'm sad to say this CD is very average. I really like the beats but gang starr's lyrics and delivery are weak. The flows seem forced and awkward, while the lyrics lack that old skool vibe. Guest appearances by Jadakiss and M.O.P. do bring up the CD's value though. I recommend this only to the hardcore Gang Starr fan's any one else should check out vintage Gang Starr."
5,skills,gangstarr is back after six long years and u bet belive they came back solid guru is at his best and so is premo niceness i will leavu there write were u stand9 of 10 lyrics 9.5 of 10 beats
5,Gangstarr-True 'Ownerz',"...in a market saturated with idol chit-chat and rhetoric, it's good to know that there is one group that maintains its presence as ambassadors of true hip-hop. Guru is consistent with the flow and shows that he can rip with the likes of Jadakiss, Snoop Dogg, Freddie Fox, etc. Premo provides the landscape that haunts you with the essence of what hip-hop really is...standout cuts on a fautless album includes...'Put Up or Shut Up', 'We Got Gunz', and the classic, 'Zonin'. It is easy to see why this group has maintained its mark in hip-hop for well over a decade..."
4,ownez,"what a gem! this beauty does justice to the diversity of the Gangstarr duo. Timeless jams and fat beats made this title stand out for me. I was chillin in Clinic 116 (Adelaides premium hiphop/breaks joint) and this was playing, i was sold instantly. the track w Snoop is pretty tight."
2,"Little Richard is fabulous, but the sound is not and it's awfully short","Little Richard had something to prove at the Toronto Peace Festival in 1969 ($14.98; Shout). His last Top 40 hit was more than a decade earlier and he would never have another. But Richard was always convinced of his own fabulousness and knew the world should be convinced of it too. And he ripped the crowd into a frenzy during his half hour set, thanks to timeless classics like ""Lucille"" and ""Long Tall Sally"" -- not to mention a shirt adorned with tiny mirrors and a towering wig. DA Pennebaker captures the moment well, though the sound leaves something to be desired and at 30 minutes this is awfully short. Why not give us three hours of the day-long festival, of which this could be a highlight? On its own, it's just not enough. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
5,Nice add-on......,"So you bought the hi-tech printer with the wireless capability, so why not actually make it wireless?Very easy to install and very nice not to have to carry a printer cord.The coolness factor makes it worth it for me."
5,NIFTY WIRELESS PRINTING,"This blueTooth adapter is much smaller than the picture leads you to believe (perhaps half an ounce) and fits INSIDE the Canon ip90 printer...when used with the Li ion battery, it provides true on-the-road wireless printing. One of my niftiest gadgets, and love showing it off to others. Can bring the printer with the laptop to clients to print out documents, also prints excellent photos on plain paper, and is FAST with the BT. A little expensive at $70, but well worth it for those who bring the Canon printer on the road for business. Highly recommeded."
4,Worked out of the box.,"This product came and it was easy to install, after I figured out where it went. It paired with the laptop right away and works just great, eliminating a need for one set of wires. I can print from across the room now. It would have been 5 stars but the instructions were not as clear as they could be and you will see a noticeable slowdown in the printing speed."
4,Works Great!,I bought this to use with my i80 printer. It works great. Easy setup & now I have wireless printing. Awesome product for the price.
5,Great for Macs,"This thing works like a charm. I place it in a central room and our three MAC laptops are able to share it from three separate locations. Instant plug-and-play Networking. It took me awhile to figure out where to plug the adapter into my i90 printer (the directions are not helpful - Canon's website eventually helped me). You plug the adapter into the FRONT of the printer, sideways, to the left of the slot where the paper exits the printer."
5,Fits right in,"The wireless board fits right inside the unit, so that is nice. Takes a little to work thru the initial setup using the Canon setup utility, but once you have it paired, it works like a charm.I agree with other comments that this should be standard in the 90, but as it is not, nice option to add."
3,Eh,"Therion's first full album. It's death metal (eh) and sounds nothing like newer Therion, no opera vox or classical influence, just death metal.. still, quite impressive for its time and fans of the genre (it's bits better than many other death metal albums I've heard) should ""eat it up""."
1,Not worth the money,"My husband and I received this as a wedding gift, and after a year (we used it about 10 times as we don't drink a lot of coffee), the latch that holds the area for the coffee grounds closed broke. It won't stay closed for anything and there is no way to fix it. I'm very disappointed."
2,Not suggesting,"I am not suggesting this coffee maker. I had it for a few months and it is falling apart! Lights are not working any more, heat is not enough and..."
3,IDEA LONG TIME COMING,This DeLonghi model comes with a brew strength selector that actually makes a difference in the flavor of your favorite grind--it works!Other brands offer such features that do not alter the strength of the brew. So it's worthwhile to note that this idea has come to fruition.The DC76T is easy to clean and does so with detachable parts.Possesses the pause & serve feature and when you are in a hurry for that first sip this is envaluable.
1,Kat,"Sadly, this product doesn't live up to it's good looks. The programmable timer doesn't work properly and if you leave water in it to be programmed to brew the next day, over half the water leaks out onto the counter. If you make coffee right away without the timer, it does make great coffee."
1,The lid will break! Don't buy it!,"The plastic lid that controls the drip stop feature is very flimsy and I have had 2 break on me and I have been extremely careful with it. It will not hold up to normal use, and without it the coffemaker will not brew. A new carafe costs $20.00 (you can't just buy a new lid) and you would be better off to buy another brand of coffeemaker!"
2,"hard to clean, broke after 9 months","This was my first programmable coffee maker, and I'm now shopping for a new one.The coffee was good.The thermal carafe is a pain to clean. The rubber seals don't seal perfectly, so coffee got in between the platic surrounding and the thermal interior carafe. I had to disassemble the whole thing every week or so. The coffee that built up inside caused a lot of drips.The programming was easy to do, but the whole thing stopped working yesterday. The timer went blank and I could not get it to brew. This was after about 9 months of intermittent use."
3,stick the finger down your pants,"I like both punk/hardcore and Ryan Adams, so I had to check out this album. Pretty good, considering this is really just a couple glorified studio sessions of Adams and Jesse Malin messing around with some (probably drunk) friends. It does well in many of the traditions of the genre -- it's loud, fast, angry and short with few guitar hooks and little to no production. Some of the songs are down-right fun to scream along to, like ""No Roolz."" That said, I think this is partly just an Adams ""f*ck you"" to people who want him pick one genre and stick within its confines. While it is totally listenable (given that you enjoy this type of thing), there is better out there."
1,WEST WING FINAL SEASON,Unfortunately four of the disks received from Amazon were faulty recordings; and thus unable to be played through.
5,prophetic ?,"Maybe I'm imagining things, but hasn't anyone picked up on the similarities between the current(potential) presidential contenders(Obama versus Mccain) and the ones in the seventh season of ""the west wing""..the young etnic democratic candidate that came out nowhere and the old but slightly liberal republican contender ? Is it too soon to say that this season was prophetic ?"
4,Just wanted the complete set,"I own the first 6 seasons and purchased the season 7 DVD's to complete the set. However, the quality of the series was already such that I won't likely watch season 7 often."
5,I love this show and this DVD collection!,"This is a wonderful conclusion DVD set to this incredible series. I did not want it to end, but like the saying goes....All Good Things.....!"
4,A Must Have Series,"The West Wing: The Complete Seventh Seasonis a must buy! The series, which owes its genesis to the movie, The American President, is probably the best and most detailed study of the happenings at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue ever created for popular culture.The seventh and final season brought back the sharp feistiness of the Sorkin/Schlamme days. Nearly all the main character stories were resolved; however, the Charlie/Zoe storyline was left hanging. This series was definitely not worthy of such a cowardly decision. (While it could be debated that Charlie was not a main character, the relationship was a major storyline over several seasons and worthy of a definitive resolution.)John Spencer's death was an ironic and unexpected blow to the series. I'm glad that ""Leo McGarry"" was remembered in a way that was befitting both the character and the man who portrayed him.Without a doubt, the entire series is a definite keeper!"
2,"Great show, poor DVD","The West Wing is my favorite television show of all time. Period. Nothing else comes even close. I could go on and on about the show, but others are doing an excellent job on that score, and that's not my point here.My point is the awful, awful DVD. No English-language subtitles (for the second year in a row). Only two special features, both about the debate episode. No insight from the actors about their take on seven years of ground-breaking television. No tribute to John Spencer. I feel as if the folks at Warner Brothers Television knew they had their market well in hand, so the quality of the product really didn't matter. ""No bother, we'll sell enough anyway."" I'm one of those that bought it anyway, but I feel as if I got ripped off."
2,Where are the Extras?,"I bought this set to complete my West Wing collection. However, I am very disappointed in the lack of extras and commentaries, especially compared to earlier seasons' DVD sets. I would have loved to have had commentary from Allison Janney, Richard Schiff, and Martin Sheen on ""Here Today"", from just about everyone on ""Requiem"", and especially from Timothy Busfield, Debra Cahn, and Allison Janney on ""Institutional Memory"". Instead, all we get is something on the live debate.If you love the West Wing and want to be able to rewatch Season 7, having the DVDs are worth it, but compared to the DVD sets for earlier seasons, this one gets a big thumbs down."
5,Great episode.,"What can I say? I really liked this episode. The acting was brilliant and the writing was captivating. Though I'll admit Josh Lyman seemed a little obsessive here, that's who his character is."
4,Tying up loose ends,"This final season of the superb West Wing tied up nearly all the loose ends very well, but left options open for spin-off series. As a foreigner it helped me to understand the complexities of the American political system, although having subtitles in English would have made some fast-talking parts much easier to follow. The only downside to the whole series was that most of the people featured were basically nice people, and sadly we know that this is not the real world. However The West Wing told it how the people would like it to be, and kept me engrossed for seven seasons - a major achiement."
1,No English Subtitles....again??,"My favorite series ever, but that's been covered elsewhere. I love owning the complete set, seasons 1 through 7...however...the show isn't a miracle cure for the hard of hearing. I suppose the extra 5 cents per unit to add English subtitles put y'all over budget top.It must be nice to have a captive audience, you should only have the opportunity to learn the lesson of LAST TUESDAY!!!"
3,The ups and downs of saying goodbye,"This is a tough call for me, after buying all the previous seasons,John Goodman's chapters (series five)being my favorite. The episode I'll play the most in series #7 will be Alda's emmee award performance in the debate episode. Amazed that Channing could receive an emmee nom for a comedy series (""Out of Practice"")after her horriffic portrayal of Abby Bartlett in this closing episode, but if this 7th season teaches us anything, it's about the transitory nature of politics. Some great episodes, some not so great episodes, I'll buy it, because you won't see something (a study of the Presidency) of this quality and detail in a long, long time."
1,Missing episodes,"Missing episodes are commonplace at Unbox. It's just incompetence on behalf of the staff here. They dont check their work carefully and only fix the problems after customers are forced to complain. This missing episode problem affected seasons 1, 2, and 7. They found the missing episodes of seasons 1 and 2 and made them available. Season 7 was missing episodes 10, 13, 17, and 19. They still havent found episodes 10 and 13 as of this posting."
3,bad disk?,"I bought this set to replace one that I lent, which was never returned, so I've bought it twice, now. The number two disk would not play in my DVD player, although my computer will play it. I find this an inconvenient flaw."
1,The West Wing Season 6 and 7,The West Wing series is a wonderful series. The problem with the sixth and seventh season and the reason we returned it is there were ENGLISH sub titles. Too bad as we would really like these to complete our set.
3,"Good to great season, basically no extra features","The seventh season was a very good season of the West Wing. No question on that.Remember that you are buying a DVD set and should consider all the extra features you DON'T get with this one. No series-ending mini-docs or beltway Talking Heads on the effects of the series. Few commentaries. No group-hug wrap-party featurette. You name it, it's not here.They could have at least included BOTH airings (east coast live and west coast live) of the debates so you could compare them. That wouldn't have cost them much at all.Also, what's with Warner Brothers not Closed-Captioning in English?"
5,Hooked,"We are a non-TV family by choice. One of our grown children offered the first season of ""WEST WING"" as something that we might like to watch. Well....that lead to watching his 4 season collection. Then, we we had to have the last 3 seasons and were addicted to the show. Thanks to Amazon and its vendors we were able to purchase the last 3 seasons to complete the family collection. And would you believe that they arrived at almost the same time so we would not be deprived. Thank you all."
2,Okay but not the best,"There was some helpful information in this book, but there were quite a few things that actually created additional fear in me. I would recommend other books over this one."
1,More afraid,"That's right, this book has made me more terrified than ever to fly. I read it cover to cover, and I am someone who loves to travel and needs to take a plane to see family; and I dread it. Instead of addressing why you are afraid to die in a plane (which is the problem correct?), it lists stats and probabilities, some of which are lies. For instance, he states no plane has ever been lost to turbulence, ever. That is a lie. Japan air, Aerolineas Argentinas, and the recent American out of JFK were all turbulence-related crashes. This author used to work for American, what do you think he's gonna tell you? Another: pilots aren't allowed to fly into level four turbulence. Yet turbulence is unpredictable! How can they not be allowed to fly into something they don't know is there! I know dying on a plane is a 1 in a million chance, that doesn't make me feel any better. Neither will this book help you."
4,Very Helpful-even for me,"I am generally closed to the power of suggestion, thinking that nothing will ever help me get over my fear of flying. While i generally stiill do not look forward to being in the air, This book has taugh me some great techniques that i never thought would work, but totally did. i flew RT to Europe without crying/screaming/drinking/and even got up and walked around, after following the suggestions in this book. I highly recommend as a very; practical guide to making it through a plane flight."
3,Somewhat helpful,"I have been a fearful flyer for over 15 yrs. There was some helpful information here but this is not the best book I have read about fearful flyers. The chapters tend to be somewhat boring and there is almost too much information. The best book I have read about fearful flyers is White Knuckles : Getting Over the Fear of Flying by Ridley, Layne - Her book is a scream! Although a bit outdated since it was published before the Sept. 11th attacks this lady takes a comical approach to this irrational fear and at the same time provides you with the necessary facts. I laughed out loud and I admit I felt much better after reading this book and ALMOST at ease on my flight from the west coast to the east coast and I had to change planes!"
5,Good fearful flyer book.,"This book was a good addition to my fearful flyers library. It gives good basic information.Another book I liked was The Backseat Flyer, more storylike and fun to read, but told of a tincture I could take that calmed me down. These two books are a good team."
2,Some Good information but didn't improve my attitude about flying,This book has some informative material but for me that didn't help much. I am able to fly but I don't think I'll ever like it.
4,Only cured while I'm reading the book...,"This is actually a pretty good book, but it hasn't helped me overcome my fears. When I have anxiety about a flight - usually months in advance - I'll pick up this book and it helps. It doesn't help while I'm on the plane though. Of course, that's no fault of the book.The most helpful aspect of the book is learning that many, many people share my fear and irrational thoughts.I'd say that if you're like me, and have extreme fear of flying, this book really isn't going to help you."
3,"Informative book, but doesn't really alleviate flying fears","This book has more information than any of the other books/audio CDs. Although very informative, it didn't really help alleviate my fear of flying. Also, I agree with a previous reviewer below who states that some of the factual information is inaccurate and exaggerated. In the book, Duane Brown actually states that he challenges any reader to find a flight that has ever gone down because of turbulence because it has never happened. This is very bold. A reviewer below quoted three flights challenging Mr. Brown over 2 years ago. As far as I know, Mr. Brown still hasn't responded to this challenge. If I knew how to get a hold of the author, I would take him up on his challenge as well."
1,An overpriced loser,"Door hinge squeaks; lubrication ineffective. Door doesn't close fully unless I jiggle it. Door handle loose; no way to tighten it. Toasts unevenly. Lower heating elements became increasingly crooked over time; both finally quit working at all. But all that is minor. Toaster doesn't shut itself off and I consider it an extreme fire hazard.Please note that I am not a timid housewife who's afraid to change a light bulb, I am a mechanical engineer. This is the worst product we've bought in ten years."
4,the great encounter,"This is the music that (partially) has been released before as ""The Great Encounter"". Eight beautiful tracks, three of them written by Buddy himself, however track eight is based on Ray Noble's ""Cherokee"". Great sidemen who are a perfect match for Buddy. Creative guitar work by Farlow, eloquent bright piano playing, a fine dry bass by Duvivier, and marvellous drumming, all in good ensemble and solo work. Well recorded."
4,The bridge at andau,This book gives a very clear picture of what went on durring the revolution. The stories are touching and detailed. This book has given me insight into the way Hungarians think and act.
4,Hidden History,Before I read this book I knew very little about the Hungarian Revolution. Now I know why. The American government did not support the revolution as it had pledged it would. This book makes me wonder about the other historical occurences that we never here about. What else has happened?
2,"good book, bad condition","This is an older book but has good context with changes in the middle east.Bought the book used, supposed to be in good condition but it was an old library book with broken spine and pages falling out"
1,Non-Fiction which is not what Mr. Michener excels at,"The expectation is that this is a story about the Andau Bridge, the bridge was barely mention until the end of the book. The picture on the paperback is totally misleading. The cover shows a bridge for cars over a river. The real Andau Bridge was a foot bridge over a treacherous swamp crossing. As the book tries to illustrate the plight of the Hungarian people, what comes across loud and clear is the brutality and inferiority of communism. On the bright side it does provide a great insight to the history of the Balkans area which at the turn of the last century was so topical."
2,Worthless and One Sided,"I'll give Michener 2 stars because his book makes for interesting reading. This book has several problems. The biggest problem this book has is that Michener is a native New Yorker, and is EXTREMELY biased. The only people whom get a word in are the violently anticommunists. Michener apparently didn't talk to people who didn't aid in the revolution. He was probably using very extreme cases in his ""study"" of the AVO. In short, this book is not history, and is anticommunist propaganda. If you want an account of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 don't read this book...I would refer you a REAL historian. The only real use that this book could be used for was to show how anticommunist the West...other than that it's a worthless, one sided account of a failed revolution."
4,The Bridge at Andau,The Bridge at Andau is a heart warming story of the Hungarian revolution in October 1956. Michener tells a story of the Hungarian people living under communist rule after WWII. The hardships they endured were overwhelming. He tells of various Hungarians and their efforts to overthrow the communists. I never had any idea of what these eastern Europeans were subject to.The reading was easy and the author indicates means by which the individual experiences were verified.
5,Bridge at Andau,"Since I participated in the 56 Hungarian Revolution as a University student I read this book with great interest. James Michener did a great literary work on this event. In October 23, 2006 Hungary had a great celebration of this revolution in Budapest. I was sorry to know that Michener was not able to attend this great festivity. His book was incredibly accurate and emotionally moving story. Michener was one of the greatest writer in the United States."
4,An All Time Best,This is one of the most entertaining and informative books that I have ever come upon. From the very beginning to the end the interest never wanes and one realises that James A. Michener has done some in depth research to make everything feel so real. This book educates as well as it entertains
1,thanks for the warnings!,"I would like to thank those who wrote about the Kindle edition and the poor editing. I read The Source years ago, just got back from a visit to Israel where I visited Megiddo. i was looking forward to reading the Kindle edition of The Source, but knowing about all of the typos etc, I will wait to order this. I read and loved the Clan of the Cave Bear books and was terribly disappointed in the Kindle versions, so won't order the Kindle edition of The Source at this time. Amazon: could you please let me know when you fix this? Thanks!"
5,A Beautiful Classic,"I read ""The Source"" when it first came out. My eldest grandson, 20 years old, loves to read and we were discussing the fact that we both like hardcover books (rather than kindles, etc.) and historical novels. He had never read ""The Source"" although he was a fan of James Michener. I got it for him and he said he really enjoyed it."
4,All Michener books are great,"When I have read the best sellers, I always go back to Michener. This is a wonderful history of religion."
5,The Best of the Best,Incredible concept for a novel. Another book that for potential readers the less that is known about it's structure and content the better. Best to become enraptured in novel only the mind of Michener could create.
5,As good a read as you'll find,"This book was one of my all time favorites. A complete history of Judaism. Great history, great story and I could not put it down."
2,Ponderous. Michener's worst.,"This book is ponderous beyond belief.For example: The description of new characters as the book goes along can take pages.I've read virtually all of Michener's books and I'm a big fan of historical fiction.This book, however, goes on and on and on more than I can stand.Strunk and White would've kept him after school for months."
5,Best book ever,I absolutely loved this book. I learned so much about humankind and the history of religion. The stories enterwined made the books so readable. Great writing.I appreciate Michener more and more as I get older.
5,Finally understanding what it means to be Jewish,"Six years of Hebrew school, a bar mitzvah, a trip to Israel, and a lifetime of being Jewish -- and yet it took a reading of James Michener's The Source for me to truly understand what it means to be a Jew. The book is awesome in its scope, using vivid storytelling to portray the survival of Judaism over the course of 11,000 years. Especially insightful is its description of the genesis of the sometimes curious laws that observant Jews follow, and how those laws have allowed the Jewish people to overcome every attempt to destroy or assimilate them.This is a must-read for anyone, Jewish or not, who has never completely grasped what Judaism is and means. It is also a marvelously entertaining book that seems perfectly suited for treatment as an epic mini-series. It is surprising that none has ever been made."
2,book,"I bought this book because I thought it was a history book, rather than a novel. Nothing wrong with a novel, just disappointed."
4,"If you like this book, you'll lIke Sarum by Rutherford too","Michener's style of creating a series of little vignettes through time allows the reader to watch the progression of time while still caring about what is happening. You aren't simply reading a dried out version of history. It becomes a living drama through the characters while still giving you the broad vision of the rich history. If you enjoy this type of epic storytelling, you will also enjoy ""Sarum"" by Edward Rutherford and its follow up of ""London""."
5,AMAZING BOOK,"I read this paperback book many years ago when it was first published. Of all my books, this is one I wanted to read again but needed the larger print of the hardcopy. This book is a real treasure. Great seller -- book is as advertised and fast shipper. Thanks!!"
5,The Source by James Michener ...,"ALL OF MY RECENT PURCHASES I RATE AS EXCELLENT. ALL EXCELLENT: PRODUCT, SERVICE & EASE OF ORDERING."
5,Magnificent piece of history,"This book is a fantastic piece of storytelling. Not only is the content of the highest quality, the construct of the different timelines in this story is second to none. This book, though more than thousand pages long, I was sad that it ended. This book is a must read for all who appreciate history and human evolution. It provides a different perspective on human beliefs and takes the reader on a journey of reflection and questioning. I loved it and can only recommend it."
4,"James Michener's book ""The Source""","An excellent, rich book. But I gave up after 889 pages, thinking every other chapter would end in a massacre, just as the rest of the book seemed to. But it was terrific storytelling."
5,The Source,"This book is one of James A. Michener's best. The compelling story of, at least in one man's view, the beginnings of the Hebraic culture(with a ton of research to back it up)"
1,Mainly a disappointment,"this book was a major disappointment. I found this book to be poorly written, repetitive and too long. What kept me mildly interested was the historical references about the historical antecedents of the Jews and Israel."
4,OK,"The book arrived faster than expected, but I was very disappointed with the condition of the book. The seller reported some wear but I was not expecting the condition to be that poor. Otherwise I was happy with the speed of shipping. I just figure that my idea of ""some wear"" and the sellers idea of ""wear"" are very different."
3,Unfulfilled,"I can't understand all the rave reviews and thought it was just ok. I really enjoyed the first four to five hundred pages or so but felt it went downhill from there. By the last two hundred pages I found myself skimming, which is disappointing after investing so much time in a book. At the end of each story/chapter (which correlate to different time periods in Makor's history) I felt unfulfilled. Basically, I expected more from each tale and felt they ended too abruptly.I also can't understand all the acclaim for Michener as a writer; his writing style is ok at best.Sure this book is poignant and thought-provoking at times, but unfortunately those parts were too few and far between. For a slow-reading book that is more than one thousand pages, its just not worth the time."
3,The Source,"This was my first James Michener, so I didn't really know what to expect. His subject has been thoroughly investigated and it interested me. But it was a very long book with very, very long chapters, making it hard to find a stopping place. I did not care for that. Another thing was that it almost read like a report or term paper rather than a novel."
4,James Michener's Historical Perspective,"The first book of Michener's I read was Hawaii and like Hawaii, Michener has a way of weaving modern day and history in to his stories. From Michener's perspective, he tries to lay the foundation for man's search for meaning and connection to a power he can neither see nor understand as the story takes you through what life would have been like at each level of the tell they are excavating in Israel."
2,Extremely difficult to follow - flashbacks.,This book was recommended to me to read prior to a trip to the Holy Lands. I gave up trying to get through it - very long and difficult to keep straight due to flashbacks to prior times.
4,A journey through the history of man,"An enchanting, and fantastic hourney through the past .... exploring the origins of religion and for that matter, the origin of the belief of man.It takes us through the past, a few thousand years back, when man (rather woman) just discovered cultivation ... the means of harnessing the nature ... all the way through the empires in Moses, Hebrews, Egyptions, Romans, and all through this journey, the small place which is the centre of the whole story, stands tall in pride ...And parallely unfolds the amusing love story between the explorers, one as staunch believer and supporter of the jews, and the other, from states who looks at it more as a profession, than passion."
2,Not great for school...,"I, a child of 14 was forced to read this book for an honors english class (read book over summer, write essay over school), and it was not a good choice of the teachers. Personally, i don't find Judiasm too enthralling, I could barely read 100 pages of this book, much less more than 1000. I (as a common opinion among my peers) find this book very dry, and unless you're heavily into Judiasm, I would not suggest this book, although you may find it interesting, if in your spare time, you tend to read the encyclopedia."
3,"""The Source"" (of boredom)","I am 13 and going into a 9th grade honors world history class next September, and am required to read The Source for class, and do a lengthy writing assignment to go along with it. My parents were astonished that I would have to read a book this long, but nevertheless I rolled up my sleves and dug in.It went slowly. Really slowly. I have decided this is the first- and last- book of James Michener I will ever read. I have heard it is a good book, and respect those opinions, but I don't need to hear all the details of the Jewish religion. I am not Jewish, and have no interest in world history, especially stuff that happened Before Christ.I would recommend this book to anyone who is really passionate about ancient world history and the begining of Judaism, and of course to those unfortuanate few that have to read a 1075 page book during the summer."
1,This book wa the same thing over and over,"The Source, by James Michener, I found to be quite repetative. The story line has no twists or turns, and there are no suprises in the plot. Over the course of the book, the Jewish people who inhabit Tel Makor are killed, and then they rebuild. In my opinion, if you read the first chapter, you have read the whole book."
4,Bosch filters are quality,"I researched oil filters for my Honda minivan and read some very detailed discussions and analysis from people who had gone into great depth, and the best one they found was the Bosch. I was able to find the one I needed here on Amazon. Works for me."
4,It's pretty good.,I have had great success using the catalpa worm and the blood. During the hottest months of summer I've actually had this stuff out perform live bait and cut bait when fishing for channels.
2,No luck with the catfish...,This dynamite didnt blow anything up. We used it on trotlines by or docks thinking it would catch the big ones. After a weekend of trying we came up empty. I did catch a few catfish in the same spot using worms so I knew they were there.
1,alleycat,This is a very poorly made movie the lighting is awful and the script is terrible. If they used proper lighting you could at least watch the movie but as it stands i suggest you save your 10.00 bucks.
1,"""PR Guy"" review","I thought your review was hilarious.Point 1) you mention the main actress as a portrait of a beauty (""steaming beauty,"" ""bod to die for,"" ""beautiful physical specimen,"" ""no silicone"", etc.).Next, in point 2) you mention that men are jerks who see women as sexual objects.Ah, the irony."
2,Buy a Grant Green CD instead!,"Being a big fan of Grant's unique guitar playing, I've always wanted to know a bit more about the man behind the music. As far as I know, this is the only book about him. The book doesn't go into a great amount of detail. The discography and selected reviews are worth reading. I'd say your best bet to understanding Grant Green would be to spend the money you would plunk down on this book on a good CD of his- Idle Moments, Green Street, The Complete Quartets with Sonny Clark. Then you can really get your money's worth..."
5,A unique perspective of one of the greatest jazz guitarists -,Thoroughly enjoyed it! Sad that such a great player could barely meek out a comfortable living. All aspiring jazz guitarists should give the good read a go!
2,"Too Much Politics, Not Enough Biography","I like Grant Green. I always thought he was one of the four or five top jazz guitarists of his day. He deserves a true biography, rather than the immaturish writing and same old liberal rationalisms for why Mr. Green failed and died young. His career failed and he died young becauee of drugs---no one's fault but his own."
5,Unparalleled Journey into the World of Gypsies,"Dispersed for reasons unknown from their original homeland believed by many to be Rajasthan (India), traveling unparalleled roads to the newly adopted homelands of Egypt, Turkey, the Balkans, and Central Europe, i.e., Romania and Hungary, the Romani have maintained their unique identity, heritage and cultural roots through their music. This CD manages to capture the diversity and unity of gypsy life through a wide variety of instruments, musical styles, and expressions: depicting the versatility and talents of this often misunderstood group of people. Amazing how the basic rhythm and beat of life of the Romani (gypsies) can be so well represented on one CD! Erika Borsos (erikab93)"
5,Travel With The Movie,"Because in some ways the movie Latcho Drom is the ultimate road film (roaming the world with the Rom people), a CD of the music to take with you wherever you go is the perfect complement to the film experience.The music is clearly all live performance, spontaneous, and linked closely to the action of the film. For example, there is a haunting piece apparently performed in Romania where the violinist creates a unique sound by pulling on an apparently broken string of his violin to produce a soft wail. Therefore, I would expect this CD to have its largest audience among those who are already fans of the film.There is no need to see the film, however, to appreciate the pure sensory experience of the music, the joy and the sadness expressed in languages most of us do not know. For those who find the Gypsy Kings a little too pat, this collection is the ultimate antidote."
3,World Music,If you loved the movie then you will love the CD. Earthy melodies that harken to a past life and connect you to the traditional musical expression from India and the 3rd world. Not everyone will resonate with this CD. If you like exotic music and the celebration of life through primitive music you will enjoy this.
2,Latcho Drom,"Although I haven't seen the movie/video of Latcho Drom, the music on this CD is quite evocative, and takes you on the Gypsy/Romani journey, from their origins in India, right through to Romani music from Romania, Hungary, France and Spain (which is more like the sort of music I was expecting on this CD). I think you'd get more from this CD if you'd actually seen the movie."
3,Could be better...,"We purchased this carseat because of its safety record, however, I cannot wait for my son to outgrow it!1) It is extremely heavy.2) The handle always gets stuck.3) The fabric is about as comfortable as a plastic shower curtain.However, there is something good about this carseat...it can be used with our bugaboo stroller."
2,Too complicated,I do not like the way it is set up to look up information for each chapter and subject. It flops around to look up added info by having to flip pages from one end to another chapter to get a better understanding of each subject being covered per chapter. This is why I say it is too complicated.
3,"The contents are complete, I'm back in school!","The contents of this book is everything needed to perfect your writing skills. From the use of a comma, quotation marks to the proper arrangement of the sentence."
5,Best Reference Book!,"I've used the ""Gregg"" (as we refer to it in the office) for the past 7 years, and it's the only reference manual for grammar and punctuation that I need. I can find everything in this book! I love it!"
5,Superb reference,"This manual is a must have. I purchased my first one several years ago. As an English major, I often get calls from co-workers, family members and friends asking grammar questions, etc. I recently bought a copy for my granddaughter who is in her freshman year of college. I know she will find it invaluable. Every household should have a copy."
5,Very happy with purchase,Delivered quickly. Just as described. Will come in handy in my studies to become a scopist.
4,Gregg Reference Manual,"I received the item, within the promised time. The book was in good condition, without highlighted areas, and CD. The pricing was very affordable."
2,Awful!,"According to the reviews of this page, my opinion is definitely in the minority. I honestly don't like a single thing about this book. It is a required text for a class I'm taking this semester. I think this book is very poorly organized and it is set up really weird. The whole thing with numbering the paragraphs is very annoying and makes it hard to find what you need. Also, this book has a ton of examples. But it doesn't have anything in the way of step by step directions. It tells you how the document should look, but it doesn't tell you how to get there. I have talked to a couple of other women also using this text and they are just as frustrated as I am. A much more useful resources that covers a lot of the same material (especially in regards to punctuation and grammer) is the AAMT Book of Style. I definitely plan on selling this thing back to the bookstore at the end of the semester."
5,Love this Product!,I have had this manual at work for several years and decided I needed one to have at home. The price was unbelievable and shipping was extremely fast. The book itself was just as described.
5,Teriffic Resource,"If you only have one reference source in your library, this should be it. Much easier to use than surfing the net for answers. Clear and thorough. Great for college students!"
5,Excellent resource,"I first encountered Gregg when it was a required text in an English composition class I took in college. Over the past several decades, I've bought every new edition of the GRM and have relied on it in my work in various educational institutions. Like me, you may want to have one copy for home and one copy for the office. I absolutely agree with other reviewers that it is not only easy to understand but also easy to use. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
4,Gregg Reference Manual 10th Edition,"I am a medical transcriptionist and my job requires to know punctuation, spelling, and good grammar. This book is presently serving its purpose. I may not know everything but whenever I have a question regarding punctuation and grammar, I always refer to the book. Because of this book, I am able to do my job confidently and it is so rewarding to know that I am doing it right. I still have a lot to read up on this book, but I am glad that there is such a book to help out people like me, although a high school graduate and still needing help in these areas. Thank you for making it possible."
5,expect more change from now on,"This collection of things originally published in many places reminds me of reading The Saturday Evening Post at my grandparents' home when I was young to see what kind of beliefs Americans were willing to consider. Feeling incredibly heretical and schismatic in 2009, I am delighted that chapter 4 of this book considers major intellectual changes in directions in world history as heresy. Particular insights on Communism as a heresy of Capitalism, making possible a company state controlling a society as science fiction writers have attempted to picture the kind of future into which we keep skidding down like a bobsled going clear through to China if our finances are likely to teach us anything is highly amusing."
4,Nice Read,"This is a pretty good book about a skater girl who loves art and meets a prep guy. Inspite of their differences and against practically the whole town's wishes, they fall in love and struggle to keep their relationship together. I think it was pretty good but seemed to be for the junior highschoolers."
4,Great HS read!,"I picked this book up at a bookstore, needing a light read. I found it highly amusing and light-hearted. It was definitely good to settle into for a day and get wrapped up in the story of Angie and Carter, something that any teen can relate too. I would definitely recommend this book to Young Adults (as I work in a library)."
1,...,"I can't even begin to express how much I disliked this book. First off, the characters are stereotypical and shallow. The author tries to paint a picture of division in social class, with the ""skaters"" and the ""preps"" (or whatever they're called in this book). Instead of accomplishing that, (like it was accomplished in ""the outsiders"") the book comes off sounding like it was written by a bunch of ""punk-rock"" wannabees. The plot is also far from original. I couldn't even finish it."
4,Bargain Bin Find,"I found this cassette in a bargain bin back in 1987 or 1988. I didn't know at the time it was a compilation, I just wanted to hear some pre-Halen, post-Montrose Sammy. . .Since then, I have heard much of his earlier albums in full, and I have to admit that Capitol Records did a pretty good job cherry-pickin' Sammy's most rockin' tracks for this compilation. Good stuff!"
4,He delivers ROCK and can write.,Classic early Sammy...I have done everything for you...that alone defines a career and he has built on it over and over.
1,Do Not purchase products from KOSS,"I purchased a Koss Home Theater and it lasted about a year. It is a lemon and the company appears to be out of business. There is an electrical problem with this home theater system. I do not understand how this product has not been recalled by the consumer product safety commission. I called customer support and I was told that Koss is going through changes and they could not help me (in other words, they are out of business). The only customer service and company number available for Koss Electronics no longer helps its customers. I don't know why there hasn't been a recall. Please stay away from Koss products."
5,Powerful stuff,"Im the kind of person that likes to think of myself as an electronica connoisseur... House and trance follow very basic formulas that make it all to easy to blend in and not stand out in any way... So I am always looking for those talented few who know how to break these formulas to create trance and house that is truly unique.Needless to say... I HAVE FOUND THAT HERE!John Lord Fonda has a beautiful sound that is all his... I would describe his sound as telling a sifi story about the future when the story was made 30 years ago. Its a retro sound using a present subject using futuristic equipment.If you are looking for something that is outside of the norm from your mom and dads house and trance, I recommend this CD."
5,Trace Adkins - greatest hits,Fabulous CD. He has a super voice. I played it non-stop for about a week. Terrific buy!!
1,Ouch!,These are the best songs this guy's got? This one's a real stinker but it still gets one star for keeping the number of songs to a minimum.I hear Trace is a really nice guy but that's no excuse for making bad music. Hopefully he can find some new songwriters and get this thing turned around.'There's A Girl In Texas' is decent and probobly the only song that won't have you racing for the nearest window ledge.
4,I recomend it for who wants to know more about Bilingualism!,"Bilingualism is a complex and very entrusting subject, I recommend this book for who wants to know more about it!"
4,"lovely for older kids, maybe not so good for the younger set","These are indeed lovely crayons. They are so easy to use and the colours are lovely. With a little one--just turned two--who loves them, they get spread rather thickly on the paper, which is going to be pricey after a while. My main complaint, which would not apply for older kids, is the shape of the cap. If the crayons are being used so that they're relatively flat across their tops, they have to be retracted before the caps are put on. Otherwise the crayon get stuck in the cap and pulled out of its holder next time they're opened. With that caveat, and, of course, they must remain capped when not in use or they dry out, they're a lot of fun!"
4,Great product!,These are wonderfully colorful and take very little pressure to achieve remarkably vivid color. My four year old loves them and the older kids have used them too. You can take a Qtip with water and blend some of the colors for a neat effect too! I would recommend these to anyone who has a child who loves to color and even one who doesn't like crayons.
2,"About Being A Reporter, Not About TMI.","This book was written by a man who, as he himself admits, knew virtually nothing about nuclear power. He provided almost no technical details of what happened or why. He honestly didn't even manage to convey the suspense surrounding the accident.I would say that this is not a good book about TMI. However, it is a good book about being a reporter covering a major breaking news story. It copied a number of the newspapr stories the author wrote at the time, so it is a good study of how reporters spin events and condense a day's experience into a few column inches."
2,Black marks on copies,"The cartridge looked the same as HP ones I have purchased in the past, but the quality of the printing is not acceptable. I have wiped the toner smudges off the roller, and it sometimes is better for a short while. But the smudges and black marks return. If you have an answer for my problem I would love to know what it might be. We can not send copies to our clients with black marks all over the copies! I will not be purchasing this cartridge again."
1,Bad experience with AAA Toner on leaking cartridge.,"I purchased a cartridge from AAA Toner. The black powder ink leaked shortly after using it. Black spots were on all of the printed pages and the powder ink was inside my printer. After paying a printer repair guy to come out and look at it and clean the inside, he showed me where the cartridge was bent and the powder leaking out. I attempted to obtain a replacement from AAA Toner, but they would not do so. If you are searching for recycle/refurbished cartridges, buy them from someone other than AAA Toner. They are not worth the hassle."
5,Loved it.,Very awesome book! I enjoyed it. It is set up the same as her other books: The Power of the praying woman and The Power of the praying wife. The prayers in this book are powerful. I am a firm believer that prayer changes things and really works in our lives. Sometimes we don't know what to say when we pray and her words help. I like all the books in the series. I think Stormie Omartin has a gift for writing these books.
2,An OK read,"First, I like Melanie Milburne, so I was disappointed with this effort. She tries to deal with the effects of emotional abuse, but the heroine just comes across as a whiner. This needed to be a longer book to explore the issue, its effects, and how the heroine overcomes the abuse - not just a blinding epiphany that she needs to grow up and put her past behind her. I couldn't see how the hero had, in a four-month relationship, seen any good side to her - I wanted him to move on and find someone else. Even at the end, MM did not convince me the two had overcome their past and differences and that their future would be a happy ever after."
5,The best photography I've seen in this type of book!,The men Jonathan Black captures are stunning. His photographic skills catch the sublime innocence of his subjects. It truly is a work of art. I'd recommend it to all my friends. Does he have a web site?
3,Sentimental at best,"I've participated in young artist programs and I found this book too sentimental and not real enough. I got tired of getting physical descriptions of the people (i.e. a shock of brown curly hair) and what they were wearing. It was great to hear about the young artist program from the view of the people running it, everyone audience and the artists want to know what that's like. But to get a truly complete look, perhaps tha author should have spent some time talking to artists themselves with young singers as part of the books focus."
3,So-so.,"This is a well-written book based an the moderately interesting (but completely implausible) concept of a world without gravity that nonetheless has a ""native"" species that is humanoid. Even given that it eventually admits that they are not truly native to the planet, I would expect them, over the millennia that they have inhabited the planet, to have diverged more from the human norm than they have. The book also features Reg Barklay prominently, which I consider a bug rather than a feature; if you LIKE the character of Barkley, you might consider this a four-star review, although even then I'm not so sure. And as a final drawback, it is a ""continued next time"" story, which I've always hated. Again, if you don't share my dislike of books that ""end"" in mid-story and require us to buy another book to see the end of the story, take my rating with a grain of salt."
2,Didn't care for it,"This story should have been ONE book. The fact that it was split into two only dragged it out long past the sell-by date. There are too many characters--too many races-- in this book to keep straight, and after a while I just quit trying to remember who's who; they weren't all that important, anyway. You're familiar with the saying ""his eyes are bigger than his stomach""? Well, this author's ambitions are bigger than his delivery. (In my opinion.) Bottom line: if this two-book story were chopped in half and fit into a single book, it would have been much better."
3,"Good, but padded.","Both of the books are interesting reads, but its clear that they're both padded to make it a two book 'set'. Not cool bilking the readers out of an extra six-fifty."
5,You can't afford to ignore these words of e-wisdom...,"Ellen Reid Smith clearly understands what it takes to generate customer loyalty. Not only does she provide the theory and the concepts for creating e-loyalty, but her practical and actionable advice makes this book a ""must-read"" for all business owners and managers. The case studies are all terrific illustrations of how to keep customers coming back, and how you can inadvertently drive them away. Anyone who ignores the advice proffered in this book will find it difficult to compete in e-business. A must-read!"
5,With a great score by Stan Ridgway,"The music for this great quirky film about city politics gone absurd in Los Angeles was written by songwriter / composer Stan Ridgway. The score alchemizes a number of ethnic instruments, ( Spanish harps, Tibetan bowls, gut string guitar,Indian oud and Russian bozuki) into a style hybrid that totally reflects this tragi/comedy without sounding like anything specific to any group or ""race"". Music for the L.A. melting pot. Five stars."
1,The Worst Book I've Read All Year,"I'm relieved to find so many that have read this book agree with me that this book was BAD! Though I wouldn't have said it was because of the date this book was written, even in the 80's I would not have liked this book. The ""hero"" was a chauvanistic brute. We try to teach our young people that a girl can say no at any time. This guy didn't believe it pertained to him and could do anything he wanted. He treated the ""heroine"" like she was a child and that women in general had no brains and shouldn't be treated as such. Don't waste your money on this book. It left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I kept reading it to see if it would get any better; it didn't."
2,Much Too Dated,"I enjoy Miss Krentz's work but found this book much to dated. The heroine was not conflicted but spineless and helpless in the face of the prescence of the alpha male. Although she considered herself assertive, she always seemed to be following orders even though she didn't feel that they were necessarily in her best interest.The initial love scene was too dated (i.e. the woman wants to say no but is so overcome by the attraction that she loses all sense of self -- actually common sense, I mean)and left a bad taste. I barely finished the book and next time probably won't read anymore of Miss Krentz' earlier work. I should have known, as I had a similar response to Ghost of A Chance."
3,very dated I fear!!,"JAK's 1985 release does not hold up well. Her writing was sharp and she brought forth vivid characters, but this chest thumping alpha male me-Tarzan-you-Jane against her wishy-washyfemale just will not please readers of today.However, if you are a JAK fan and collecting all her stuff, you will want to add this one. Not a bad read, but very dated.Worse they soak you with the higher price!! They should have released this like they did the low cost Stephanie James ones. You don't feel so bad when they give it a nice price, but this was really rotten to charge NEW BIG book prices for a very dated series romance from the mid 80's!!"
1,FORGET THIS ONE.,"This story was awful. The ""Man With A Past"" demanded a great deal on trust and gave nothing in return. It takes more than ""blind trust"" to establish a lasting relationship. Forget this one."
3,Give JAK a break...,"OK, so this may not be Jayne's finest piece of work, but it's a start. I read the reviews, but I was curious, so I bought a used copy and read the book. The reviews are valid but I looked upon this story as a jumping off point. I saw many of JAK's later themes developing within these pages (alpha male, women in the work force, etc) I basically looked upon this book as a study of Jayne's evolution as a writer. So don't run out and buy this book unless you are interested in how a popular author begins her creative journey."
3,"Didn't like the first ""Love Scene"".","The first ""Love Scene"" is just way too close to being a rape scene. True he overcame her resistance by arousing her feelings but it is still what I would call rape. I was disappointed in that scene only. Otherwise it's an okay book to read cause Ms. Krentz got them straighten out. It was written in 1985, so some of the technology is a bit out of date. I'm hoping her earlier books will not be more of the same like the first scene in this book. That type of violence is not needed in a ""Romance"" type of book."
5,Babe in Dreamland,"Lida Husik's deep, soft voice floats inexplicably over the guitar-rock music of this album as though she had discovered antigravity. ""Mother Richard"" is an anthem for nothing in particular, ""Persinthia Lawdro & John"" is a mysterious record of happy times, and ""Mickey Minnie"" is the most obtuse beauty you'll ever hear. Music for smarty-pants to sleep by."
3,expected too much,"my fault. i keep forgetting that 80 yr/old language and literature can be very difficult to follow. it's a difficult read. but if you get through, it is somewhat of an interesting book even tho i didn't really learn anything. but to coin a line from the TALKING HEADS...""same as it ever was"". ( in regard to society as a whole) phylosophically not much has changed over the decades except for maybe perspective. the problems are the same and probably always will be. bottom line is...wait til you can get this book cheap or free. just because it's considered a ""classic"" doesn't make it good. for instance..i hated ""dr.zhivago"""
1,Kessinger Publishing,"Buyer beware: Kessinger ""Publishing"" does not actually sell you a new printing of Niebuhr's book. What you end up with is actually just a photocopy of an old edition (in this case, the 1934 Scribner's printing). Unbelievably, it also includes page underlining and marginal notes, photocopied from a used and marked up version of the text. Apparently it was too difficult to find an unmarked text, or to white-out the markings when photocopying the text. If you want an unmarked version of this text, avoid the Kessinger version--you might as well buy a used copy of an actual printing rather than a photocopy of someone else's marked-up text. It is disingenuous, misleading, and possibly fraudulent for Kessinger to sell this as ""new."""
3,Practice,This is an OK book that provides minimal practice for you Spanish students. Probably more suited to upper elementary grades.
2,V2 support,"I like the idea of this product. It was easy to figure out and felt like it would give some support. However, the straps that go between your legs weren't lined up right front to back. The straps ended up being off center and there was no way to correct it. I had to wear spandex underneath the V2 support and they still cut into my legs when I was sitting. Finally, the material used made it sound like you were wearing a diaper when you walk. People would definetly be able to tell you had something on. When it come down to it, it was more uncomfortable to wear than and support I got out of it."
4,Wouldn't survive without it!,"For a pregnant woman with symphasis pubis dysfunction, this is a MUST HAVE!! This is the second pregnancy that I've experienced SPD and I would not be able to make it though without. It is a bit uncomfortable by design, but is a lifesaver!"
2,Okay,"This brace was uncomfortable for me maybe bec/ I am pregnant. When I sit down, it is so wide that it gouges me in the belly. I returned it for the plain V2 supporter w/out the hip brace and that was much better!!!"
5,Factory-recon. Mlwaukee kit,They said it wa like new and the only thing I found out is nothing in the kit was or looked like it was used except the flash light. Great deal and saved me about $450.00 Thank you very much
3,Good old Kirk...good or bad...he's always fun to watch,"Kirk Douglas is a real actor considering the crap we get these days that dontlike to get dirty and please not too physical...they might break a nail.So old movies are not as thrilling as today's special effect movies...but oldmovies had something special....real actors ...who actually had to work for a living.Anyway, in this film we have Kirk as a bad guy, good with his twisted tongue tokeep his workers interested in the big money comming from chopping down thebiggest trees which reside on land that have a Religious bunch living on it.So who gets the trees....Kirk...the religious community..or others who wants in.I guess you will have to watch this film to know the ending.I would like to mention that the choosen music for the first portion of the filmis very good...i was so surprised......ahhh old films.....get better with age..."
5,Illusions-Wonderful book,This has been a life-changing book for many people. The preface seems to reach out and grab you by the throat and demands that you read the rest of it. Most folks can't put it down once they pick it up.
5,One of my top 3 all time favorites,"This book is a classic. Keeps you laughing and engaged through the entire book, while at the same time giving you some serious food for thought. What would you do if the Messiah came down and said he was tired and turned his job over to you???"
5,A book to make us think about the way we think.,The short story in the beginning is worth the price alone. This book greatly contributed to my esteem and happiness. This is one of the few books that I *force* on people. It's such a short read you have no excuse to NOT read it.
4,A Definate Eye-Opener,"The story is short and simple and the characters are interesting. It taught me about people in general, different perspectives on life, and about friendship. Through the eyes of Richard, we meet a ""messiah,"" named Donald who is frustrated by preaching to the masses because no one will think for themselves. He begins to teach Richard how beliefs really do control our lives and that we are each responsible for ourselves. Donald's teachings definitely provided insight into my life and friendships and how I can make them better. The viewpoints presented are inspirational. The book was a definite eye-opener that I would be sure to recommend to anyone who is searching to find some answers on themselves."
5,THANKS FOR THIS BOOK RICHARD!!!!!!!,"This book was a revelation for me!!! I read it in 1 day. I have read it 16 times, and I have given it as gift some 10 times.....really good book. It is a nice story, but you will find there ( if you have eyes for see into) very useful things and techniques for the life.....EXCELLENT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,spiritual,"I have to recommend this book to everyone. The plotline behind the story isn't that great, and it is a simply written book, but it is very spiritual and full of the truths of life. Now that I have read it, in a week or so I will read it again, this time with a highlighter. This book will be placed on the same shelf as my bible, koran, and other religious and spiritual books. This book carries within it the simple truths to life. It can make a difference. It impacted me greatly, now I hope you read it so that you may be changed as well."
5,spiritually uplifting,This book gives you hope and brightens your day. I read this book every 2-3 months to renew my spirituality and strenghthen my resolve to exsist in this world.
2,Read with caution. This is just a work of fiction.,"I have reads parts of the book and know the story. This isn't a review of the book itself, so much as a very abbreviated cautionary tale. At age 19, my old roommate read this book while he was suffering from a newly-developed and undiagnosed bipolar disorder. Read during a prolonged manic stage, he took the book too literally. Suffice it to say that it did not end well. We are not all possible messiahs, and we cannot perform ""miracles"" to alter the reality around us. If you want to attempt to prove otherwise, do so in a safe place, and with respect for those who care about you."
2,A cute story as a vehicle for comforting New-Age ideas,"I must speak out. The emperor has no clothes!! I read the book and found it naive. There were some interesting ideas, but it was marred by lots of feel-good platitudes and factual errors. The search for truth is rarely easy. Most of us are not really interested in doing the work it takes to open up to life's beauty and sorrow. The beginning of the search for truth should be to question everything. God, soul, soulmate, magic, telepathy. Ask yourself why you find these ideas so compelling? Can you be honest with yourself? If you are really after truth, read the brilliant philosopher J. Krishnamurti's 'First and Last Freedom' or 'The Book of Life'. (They can be found on Amazon.com) Contrary to what Bach preaches, it is NOT choice, but rather un-choosing, un-prejudiced AWARENESS of what is that leads to true insight and love. Perhaps this book inspired the spiritual seeker in you. If so, are you open minded enough to continue what you started?"
3,Glorified trite,"Overly didactic and rhetorical wordplay. Gimmicky at best with no real meat. To compare, Alchemist was a similar book by P. Coelho which also tried to drive in simple truths (perceived) of life. But it was able to do so in a not-so-over-the-top manner. Read Tuesdays with Morrie...it does a better job teaching the same philosophy with much less ado."
2,Okay Book,"This book really confused me. I didn't get it at first. I had a hard time reading it. Richard Bach did a good job of writing Illusions. If you don't confused easily, I would recomed this book to you."
5,A Great Start to One's Spiritual Journey,"Illusions is more than just a beautiful story. It is a wonderful beginning to one's own spiritual journey. Universal Truths are elgantly woven into the practical, everyday life of the main character Richard. Richard is Everyman--he very well could be you or me. His experiences and enlightenments will inspire the reader to dig deeper into his or her own spiritual existence. Illusions should not just be read once, but time and time again."
5,A powerful message in a small package!,"I first read ""Illusions"" in my teens, and have read it at least once a year since then. I have also given copies of the paperback to many people with the statement ""If you like this, please tell someone else about it"". The parable in the beginning is extremely powerful and the rest of the book shows someone trying to make it a reality. Even if you don't totally agree with the premises, I bet that you'll spend some time wondering about the possibilities.I'm currently going through a rough time emotionally and am actually scared to read ""Illusions"" right now because I know it will force me to face some truths that I've lost sight of. However, it waits patiently on my bookshelf for when I'm ready to rediscover the joys of distroying my self-imposed limitations.A suggestion: if you like the sayings in the book, put them on index cards and post them around your house or work to offer inspiration on a daily basis."
5,Great Messages,I really enjoyed reading this book. I thought that the messages were profound and that the story was interesting to read. Worth getting!
5,One of my all-time Top Ten,"A high-school classmate turned me on to this book, which I read the summer after graduating from high school. The whole time I read it, I kept thinking, my goodness, I have thought this way too! Weirdest feeling I've ever had -- and no other book has caused that reaction in me. (Hence, I agree with Jason O'Brien's review further down.)This is, quite simply, a life-changing book. I have since read everything Bach has ever had published, including all his airplane stories such as ""Stranger to the Ground"", ""A Gift of Wings"", etc. (However, ""Illusions"" and ""One"" are, in my opinion, the best of Bach.)Years later, I came across Jane Robert's ""Seth Speaks"" and that whole series, and found ideas remarkably similar to Bach's. As it turned out, Bach attended some Seth sessions. (The Seth books are available here at Amazon.com)"
5,A Simple Review,"Others have written their thoughts before me, and their words speak volumes more than mine will.I will make this short and to the point:This book changed my life, period.Read it, and you come away changed."
4,Its all and illusion,Allusions touched me in a way no other book has. The new Massiah brings a light into one man's life. He also brought a life into mine. The Massiah brings about points that make you think about who you are and where you might be going. Allusions makes you think long and hard about why things are. Is all noticable to the human eye or are we all just ignorant and think its all magic. The Massiah has claimed to quit his job but the reality of it is that he can never quit no matter where he goes or what he does he wil posess powers and know things that the average person would not know. IF you are a religious person i think you will enjoy Illusions very mcuh. It makes the normal mind think with all the point that the Massiah brings up in his handbook. The book is great for all people of all ages and i think everyone should read it.
3,Illusions Can Be a Dillusion!,"Everyone can add credance to their own life if they try to get on the band wagon by reading of others who have been traveling trying to define themselves. ""Illusions"" is just such a journey. Dillusioned Baby Boomers will better understand this kind of writing, having been there on similar roads to the ones described by the author, as the era mentioned was one of self discovery, hippies, free love, redefining christianity and Christ. Reading this novel will shred self dillusions and make one wonder why they haven't thrown away previous beliefs that have handcuffed them to old ways and limitations so they can just walk on water at will or heal their ailing grandmother by holding her hand. Quite a ""trip"" in literary timelessness, you will either think that Richard Bachs hould have stopped writing at his last novel ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"" or changed his religeon. A very interesting read. You will never look at self discovery the same again."
4,It doesn't have to have special meaning,"This book was recommended to me by a very christian friend who thought I might get some enlightenment from it. I didn't reach nirvana by reading this book, but I did enjoy the story, and I liked the overall format. It was a good quick read and entertaining. I can see how the simplicity and conciseness of it can lend it to being a good assignment for grade school english classes."
5,Classic,I had some reservations about reading this book but am glad I was encouraged to do so. This is my 7th copy and since it is digital maybe I wil not have to replace it again. The messages inside are very self positive. I always feel much better after reading the book and have taken some quotes to live by.
5,A small gem,"It doesn't look like much a skinny little book. The copy I have has the picture of the blue feather on the cover which always catches my eye.Actually just thinking about it, it is time to take the book back down off the shelf and re-read it again.This a book to pick up when times are tough or when you need a new take on life. Or just a reminder that you are the one writing this story and you chose what happens next.This is a good story and at the same time a constant source of wonder and inspiration. It is a book you will quote at people until you irrate them and then you will lend them you copy and have to beg to get it back.A joy a wonder a must read. Not so much a book as a well loved friend who happens to have bindings!!!"
5,Beautiful,"I read this book after Jonathan Livingston Seagull and it is sort of a continuation of the ideas expressed in that book. This story is about a mechanic turned messiah, who escapes the crowds demanding miracles and answers by 'barnstorming', flying an old plane into farmer's fields and offering people plane rides for a few bucks. That is how he meets the author, who also barnstorms. Free from all the constraints of the modern world, the two pilots share the same field and form a fast friendship. The messiah begins to teach the author his knowledge, and helps him to understand the way the world works. Again, the theme of belief in self and achieving the impossible is present in this book. Although with fewer metaphors, Illusions presents more questions and ideas than Jonathan did. A very powerful ending."
3,Illusions Review,"I thought the book ""Illusions"" was an insighful piece that was both enlightening and interesting. While books with such depth, spiritually and religously are not what I am used to, I found that I was able to relate to this book and its morals. Through a simple story of two men, the author depicts ideas that with the help of others, anyone can believe, in themselves and others.This story of two men, one a Messiah that helps the other along the way, shows the practical way in which we find help in the oddest of places. The books ideals are inspiring and show that we can find light in the darkest of places. Sometimes we spend too much time looking at the negatives and the good things in life may pass us by.This book made me feel good because it helps the reader to look at their own life in a new light, with hope and encouragement. I would recommend this book to other readers looking for an upbeat, feel-good, inpirational book."
3,Ilusions,"This novel, is an incredible work of literary achievement. With its imagery and word usage it really brings out the authors true intentions on the reader. The feelings embedded behind the writing style sucks a reader into a pattern that is inescapable. Though the subject either lovable or detestable depending on who you are and your religious values. Even besides that rough aspect, the ideals are mainly universal, the philosophies of life that are true to any human. A well written novel is a good thing, that plus a purpose is better, that plus a lesson is the best. An authors greatest achievement is changing a persons view after reading their art, weather its an ideal or a feeling. This piece of literature ends with and optimism that consumed the reader on life, peace, and the authors future in writing. :)MA"
3,Magic,Well this may not have been one of my favorite books I have read but it is a very interesting book! You had to read a couple of pages to actually get into the book. If you are into magic and flying planes then it would be a very good selection to read. I got a little confused everyknow and then but i had to go back and read the page again then i got to the point. But considering it was a book for an educational assignment it was about the best a teacher has ever assigned. Girls would enjoey this book a little more than guys from my point of view.
1,Shouldn't messiahs do more than make screwdrivers float?,"You can't imagine my relief when I discovered that nobody in my bookgroup liked this book. If they had, I think I would have had to quit that group. This book was shallow and did not do justice to the title of messiah. A true messiah is about much more than making random items float, having vampires materialize out of thin air, and dying a predictable and annoying death. Being a messiah is about being countercultural and addressing the injustices in the world. This book drove me up a wall and it nearly went out the window many times. The only reason I finished it was because we made a promise to finish every book before our meetings. I would have given it a zero star rating, but it didn't go that low."
1,The commercialization of spirituality,"Upon finishing this trite book I felt I had been had by yet another corporate motivational speaker. You know, the one that makes you feel good about your job until the next day after the warm and fuzzy feelings wear off and reality sets in your back to sending out resumes."
1,Illusions,"This book is a good fictional story, but if you want truth I would suggest a more realistic book. As far as inspiration goes Bach tries to influence the lives of his readers by explaining that they can do anything. If you have beliefs in past lives and fantasy beings this is the book for you. Bach mixes a man who can do anything and the last days of his life teaching another man about the illusion of the universe. On a personal note I do not believe in what the book teaches. I would like anyone who reads it not to just accept everything it says as true, but think for yourself on what is and what is not correct."
1,An enormous waste of time,"We read this book for bookclub and, even though it's a quick read, it was nevertheless excrutiating. At the end of the group, I threw my copy in the fire in the small hope that I might save just one person from wasting their time reading this steaming pile. This is hands down the worst book I've ever read - you can get the same life lessons from your average Barney video in far less time."
1,What a load of crap,"Sorry to disagree with my fellow non-messiahs out there, but this book is not worth the little time it takes to read.Yes, it's in interesting look at the complications of the human soul and psyche. It's also wrong. If you're a pantheist, or at least a universalist, you might find confirmation of your beliefs here, but for the rest of us, it's New Age tripe that borders very precariously on the blatantly heretical."
5,WHAT A JOLT ON REALITY!!!!!!,"This book is a winner! Not recommended reading for the closed minded and those with no fire in their hearts. The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah...truth/ consequence, reality/fantasy,fiction/non-fiction== they are all relative to the perspective. I have read this book countless times and only enjoy the story and the delivery more. Mr. Bach has an insight and an ability to articulate that insight for us all to enjoy and refer (eg..the messiah's handbook). This eclectic novel is revealing to all that enjoy adventure and flirt with questioning the norm. Definetly my top '5' list!!"
5,Fun for all ages,"My mom told me when I was about 10 that she made a point to read Illusions at least once a year. I didn't read this book untill I was about 17, and from that point I knew why. Every woman in my family has read Illusions, I got my copy from my 2nd cousin. Everytime I read it, it brings a smile to my face and I am a much happier person. It truely affects ones way of thinking, I do recommend it to every person I meet. If the whole world thought this way, the evil in our world would be all but gone."
5,The book of my life.,"I give this book to every high school graduate I know.....when they come back, mostly a few years later, I know they have develolped a thought process that will serve them well in their adult lives."
5,Illusions : A philosophy on LIFE,"Hey all you web goers out there! Have I got a book for you. Illusions, by Richard Book. This is a moving story about a pilot who encounters a Messiah. The Messiah's name is Donald Shimoda. Donald tells Richard, the pilot, that he has the potential to be a great messiah. Richard is very unsure about what Donald is saying to him, so Donald gives him the Messiah's Handbook. This is the best part of the entire book. Inside the Messiah's handbook are different sayings and philosophies. And whenever Richard has a question on life he just opens the book, and it tells him what he needs to know. These words and phrases are so incredibly powerful, they move me inside. The story is not only great, but all the philosophies are great ways of looking at LIFE."
5,Thought provoking books.,"I pull my tattered paperback copy of this book and read it almost yearly. I find new meaning each time that I open it. The wisdom is compelling and inspired; the premise is novel and worthy of suggesting to anyone who is searching for understanding in a world where many things seem to happen at random. The writing is simple and plainspoken. It is certainly not an all encompassing book of truth, but it lends yet another piece in place... to the puzzle."
5,"Yes, whith this book I started my spiritual journey too!!","20 years ago I discovered this little treasure by ""accident"". I started attracting things or situation with the method exposed, then making holes in the clouds, ... Then I said, this knowledge must come from another source.. and .. Twenty years after, arrived to the mistery Schools, AMORC, SRFS, BOTA, and continue looking for the light. Thanks Richard."
4,Another Feather in the Hat of the Mind,This is highly recommended read for the mind that is exploring the fine distinction between reality and illusion.
5,Tremendous Book,"I've given away many, many copies of this book since I read it almost 25 years ago. Its wisdom is timeless and can change your life!Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah"
5,If you had only one book to take everywhere ... take this one.,"I read Illusions for the first time as a teen. I was amazed by the simplicity of the message. So simple yet so powerful. What I love about Bach is his lack of 'fluff' in this book. No fattening the pages for publishers satisfaction. What it is is simple, powerful, clean, utter transparency. I have traveled the world with this book. My daughters have loved this book. It says in such clean, clear, uncluttered humour what so many strive to say with too many words."
5,A Fantastic start to spiritual enlightenment,"I was told to read this book by a spiritual teacher/healer I met whilst doing a course and thought to myself, if this lady thinks its a great book, well Im going to read it. Wow I was so glad I did for it really hit home, it made me feel alot more compfortable about my spiritualism, I dont worry about what's happening in the future or the past, I just live for the moment how I want to live it.Love & Light to all xoxoxoxoxoxooxoxoxoxoooxoxoxoxo"
3,Jonathan Livingston Seagull Stuttered,"I can't help but get the vague feeling that Bach wrote this book because not enough people ""got"" the ideas behind Jonathan Livingston Seagull, to which Illusions has often been called the sequel. I believe ""repetition"" might be a better word for it. Repeat the same basic lessons and subtext of that book, but add into that stickier and overly complex explanations of the exact same ideas and club people to death with the meaning. If you're bright enough to understand the lessons in the aforementioned book, you're much off better with it. ""Illusions"" is more or less just pummeling to death with new-age philosophy, and not even philosophy without significant holes. I can't say that it's altogether poorly thought out, or wholly uninteresting, but the resulting sticky, sugary mess of text is just a bit much to stomach."
3,Illusions,"I think this book is great, because the first time I read it was a time of inner turmoil for me. I was having a hard time dealing with my teachers, and this book gave me some hints on how to settle my peace of mind. The funny thing was was that it was a gift from the teacher that I disliked the most. I was close to my breaking point because of this teacher, but after I read Illusions, it reminded me that we created this whole dream world we live in, so we can choose to participate or not. Unfortunately, the dream world has progressed to the point where it is almost impossible to not participate without giving up everything. The story in this book is simple but in between are hints that helped me and could be helpful to you, so please for your own sake, read this book."
5,Film Version?,I first read Illusions in 1980 and have wondered ever since why this has not been made into a film. It has tremendous potential. A cross between The Great Waldo Pepper and Inherit the Wind.
5,Thought I was alone,"It is a wonderful feeling that there are other creatures that know what I know and see what I see. Most people think I'm nuts. That's OK. You either see it or you don't. It is amazing to me that most people in this world are satisfied with the insanity of it all.Greetings to all my Kindred Spirits. Don't bide your time uneasily. If only one creature understands...your mission is complete.Thanks Richard, there are no words I could use to express my graditude for your visit to my meadow."
3,"An thought-provoking and touching book, if a bit sappy","This story is well written with likeable characters, an intriguing, unusual plot, and some very good ""life lessons."" I enjoyed it. It is, however, a little bit sappy, and somewhat predictable. Read it, enjoy it, and maybe even learn something from it, but take it with a grain of salt."
4,Jesus!,"This short book changed the way I look at life in a wierd way. An interesting idea. The story isn't memorable but the ideas behind the stroy and even the wierd things that are said make it a very good book to read.It often made me stop and think, read over things twice to understand, which is a good thing by the way."
5,Read it again and again,"Who is this reluctant messiah? What are 'illsusions?' YOU, are the reluctant messiah and illusions are reality (or lack of it), according to Richard Bach, in his novel ""Illusions."" According to ""Illusions"" we are the messiah who walks on water, who walks on 'illusions'. Throughout this book I continuously thought back to one of my favorite books by the Buddhist monk and peacemaker, Thich Nhat Hanh, entitled ""The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching."" Both of these books are not about religion, but rather, spirituality, the realms of reality and what part we play in them. Both Hanh and Bach teach that ""reality"" is what we make of it. Our spirit, what is innate in all of us, is the golden compass.""Illusions"" is simply a fabulous book, not because of any great literary merits but because it awakens the spirit. I am sure the pages of this book will become worn and weary as I read it again and again."
4,A Powerful Journey,"""Nothing good is a miracle, nothing lovely is a dream,"" declares Donald Shimoda, the author's ""Reluctant Messiah"" in his 1977 novel, Illusions. With his level-headed, nonchalant mannerisms, Shimoda delivers countless (often ambiguous) lessons to a skeptical Richard Bach.Posing as a fellow aviator, Shimoda accompanies Richard as he travels from state to state, offering passers-by ten minute rides in his biplane. Richard immediately realizes that this is no ordinary man, and his life-altering lessons soon begin. A journey of self-discovery commences over the pastures and cities of rural America as Shimoda guides Richard to understand that what he perceives to be reality is in fact an illusion.Prepare yourself for a new way of thinking, as Illusions will leave you reconsidering your outlook on existence; what is real, what is possible?"
3,A New Aproach On Life,"I think I'm sitting on the fence with this book. I can't really decide if I like it or not. I like the idea of bettering ourselves through personal triumph, but everyone needs comfort from someone, whether from a friend, God, whoever. I don't really believe that one can make themself perfect at all. No one is perfect. I do like the idea of becoming a messiah because it's comforting. It makes you look at yourself and others in a more positive manner. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a new approach to how they look at their life."
4,What an Illusion,"Illusions: according to Don Shimoda, Richard's newly found friend, this is what life is all about. This is a book that not only shows a different view about life, but also offers quite interesting quotations that will make readers reflect about their actions. When reading the passages, you will see that many of them may apply to your daily life and may help you face it in a different way. This is certainly a pass it on book, and this is what I am doing right now: trying to make all of you read a book that will bring joy into you day!"
1,Who is this book even FOR?,"I don't know what I was expecting from this book. I found it with a sign that said ""free"" outside the English department of my University, so ""hey, why not?""I haven't even finished it, but I know it won't do much for my soul. I kind of thought it would be more spiritual, but it is just some nonsensical passages that seem too obvious to be profound in any way.Richard rides around in a plane with Don, who also has a plane. They discuss random things. Richard looks up to Don and Don tries to teach him the ways of becoming a Messiah. At one point, Dracula is conjured up in an image and then just exits the scene. I guess this is to prove a point, but it just doesn't seem to flow with the rest of the book.Okay, so the point is everything is an illusion, or you know, we make our own destiny, blah blah. If you need a book to tell you that, you were never meant to control your destiny at all."
5,"If there's one book you read in your entire life, this is it","This is the best book i've ever read. it was inspiring. donald shimoda is a messiah for all to learn from. this book has changed my life. i own 3 copies of it. i carry one with me where ever i go. i bought all my closest friends copies of this book. i only paid about 5 dollars for those copies, but if they'd have been $500 i would still have bought every copy. it's worth your money. if you buy it and don't like it, i'll buy your copy from you. how's that sound?"
4,Amazing perspectives to life!,"Illusions is without a doubt one of the best books I've ever read. The unexpected concepts portrayed from the opening cover to the last page are captivating. Once I began, I could not put it down until I finished. Every once in awhile it's great to read or view some kind of media that offers to give one a new perspective to life, and Illusions certainly does that. This book is just brimming with incredible (and quotable) phrases and thoughts. I am even planning to use something from it for my senior quote in high school! I highly recommend it to anyone interested in exploring different ideas about life and existance."
5,WOW!,"This was the most touching, funny, wonderful book I have read in a long time. I couldn't put it down. I liked it so much, I read it to my sister, who loved it just as much. I would suggest this book to anyone who loves a good story and has ever thought about the deeper things in life."
3,This book was interesting,"This book was interesting in the fact that things took some twists and some turns. I would only give this book an 8 out of 10 because I personally was not all into it. The fact that the guy got to chose how he wanted to die in the end was kind of bazaar because that isn't really how life works. If we got to choose how we wanted to die, why are their cancer and all kinds of illnesses? No one wants to die a horrendous death, so it would be a great thing if we did get to choose how we died. The book in all was ok."
5,My Bible,"Illusions is a classic. I keep a hardback for myself and a paperback to lend out, because I have lost a few loaners. Illusions will make you think of the world in a whole new way. My life has never been the same since I read it. There are some truths a none fiction work just can't touch. It takes a book like Illusions to touch the untouchable."
5,this book started my spiritual journey,"When my Grandma handed me this book I was very young, as I grew reading the words I was revealed to myself. This book has a way of talking to you, it becomes your friend as you journey together through the limitless nature of ones self.buy this book and enjoy a breath of truth"
4,Sweetest Love Story,"I've heard several people complain about how ""campy"" this is. I believe their basis for the complaint is caused by the voice redub the filmmakers had to do.Other than that, I see no problems in this flick. The love scenes are heartfelt, & romantic without being overly revealing or showing nudity. The ladies are gorgeous as well."
5,"beautiful, sexy, funny","Wow this movie is awesome, one of those movies you cant help but watching over And over! The chemistry between the two main characters is undeniable.....plus they are both extremly attractive. This movie sent chills up my spine. must see!"
5,Touching,"I knew Lisa Ray could act, but this was more than what I expected. The story is well spun, witty and has a easy going pace. Loved it!"
3,I want more!,"After seeing I cant think Straight (4 Stars!) and the world unseen (3 Stars!) I have to say I love the actresses and their struggles. Love the director. As far as LGBT movies I cant think straight is in my top 10 for sure. Only down side is it definately leaves you with an extreme desire for more. More story line, more sex, more of anything! But hey we cant have it all can we."
2,want a history lesson?,"this movie was nothing like i had thought,if your want to know more about the cultures of other countries, this is the movie for you.as far as a movie about two girls becoming lesbians, it does not make sence in this movie"
2,Don't trust the movie by its label,We all thought it was going to be sexy and hot and we seen more action in a Miller Lite Beer commercial. Did not think it was that funny. Very disappointed after see Perfect Ending
4,I can't think straight.,"I was searching for a romantic movie and realize the pickings were a little slim, I read a little about this one and decided to give it a try and I enjoyed it. It make me think outside the box a little."
3,Pretty decent,"It's awkward at times, but it's still an entertaining movie. It's a more interesting love story than most, with a lot of cultural issues thrown in (the Middle East quagmire, family's shock at ""coming out,"" and religious views)."
3,a lot of potential,"i had high hopes for this movie based on other reviews, and it really had a chance to add something worthwhile to lgbt filmography, but it never quite lived up to its potential. if you're looking for a similar feel-good romantic comedy, ""imagine me and you"" is much much better."
5,Refreshing,I found this movie very refreshing. It is a change from all of the crap that is out there. I found it very real and though the actors aren't your typical Angelina Jolie (as widely known) they were great and beautiful (more like gorgeous). I recommend this movie as well as Shamim Sarif's The World Unseen; they're both great stories.
5,Fun and cute,This movie is sweet and very funny at times. Great cast. Wonderful look into the middle eastern culture and mentality.
2,Boring - not enough romance before they got together!,Boring and moved too slow - not enough romance before they got together and decided to have children. Kind of a waste of time.
2,Not enough information given.,The blurb about this movie should have let me know there was going to be about a homosexual relationship. After a while into the movie I begin to get suspicious but I waited for the ultimate proof. I do not want to see that kind of scene and I wish I had been warned so that I didn't spend my money on renting a movie that I didn't finish.
5,Replacing a loaned book that was not returned,It's been many years since I have read this book. I am a huge fan of Richard Brautigan and will be rereading all of his works that I now have. Normally I do not reread any book because there are so many books just waiting for me to discover them.
5,Couldn't Put It Down,I haven't read a book such as this in many years. You felt sad for Bill the way he was enlisted in the army. Harry Harrison kept Bill's adventure always interesting and exciting. Never a dull moment. What amazes me the most is Harry Harrison in-depth understanding of the military. This story is a must read.
3,Sci-Fi Pulp,"Bill the Galactic Hero is the epitome and parody of every sci-fi book. He's the ultimate hero and the total loser. You have to love the sci-fi genre to appreciate Bill. Sure it's corny, and some of the jokes are rather low brow, but it's not meant to wring your brain in comprehension. It's a book that you can sit and read without shifting your brain out of first gear.(No offense intended, Mr. Harrison.) Lots of fun."
5,Bill the hero,"Bill the galactic hero is a fantastyc book, a parody of our future and you will not stop laughting."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"If you are big and stupid, be careful when you say yes.This is exactly what Bill is, however, and he mentions to get himself signed up into the military.From there, the military and sf satire is piled on thick as he gets into all sorts of trouble, time after time after time. No trouble that makes you instantly heaps smarter by mutagen or something, unfortunately for him.Often amusing."
1,It sank as fast as the Titanic,"Order this for my son who was going on a Boy Scout adventure. This was supposed to be ""Water-Resistant to 50 Meters"".....did not make it 5 feet. Amazon took care of the problem."
2,control? no,"While this item is comfortable, it is in no way body shaping! First of all it's too short so if you are looking for some tummy control look somewhere else! You could barely tuck this into your pants and if you do it will just come out if you sit or move too much. The fabric is the same as a bathing suit but without the tightness or thickness, it is very thin. I'm 135lbs but after 3 children (3 c-sections) I was looking for some tummy control without having to wear a giant pair of panties that go half way up your body and then roll down while you are wearing them (not to mention having big panty lines!)If you are looking at this as a support bra, forget it, the fabric is too thin and flexible to lift or support anything.In my opinion if you have a great body, much like the models and want a comfortable tank to wear under clothes or around the house and don't mind your tummy hanging out, then this is for you. People will think you are wearing a bathing suit top though (with no bra liner)."
2,Not What I expected,This cami is just like any cami you would wear with any outfit. I would not categorize this as shape wear... Not to mention that it is pretty short in length.
2,not good,"I talked to the customer service if I can use this for my yahama guitar brand, they said yes it will work, one i put it on it sound terrible, not matched at all"
1,missing strings,The package I received only had 5 of the strings in it. Won't be ordering these again.
2,"Not worth it. Get ""Running With Man's Best Friend"" instead.","This book, written by a minister who runs, is mostly a paeon to dogs. Its running advise is dated and general, and it offers little specifics about running with dogs."
4,Carpenter or Craft Pen aka Contractor Pen,"This Fisher Space Pen is styled to look like a space craft, but made of lightweight material so that a magnetic strip easily serves to hold it to a steel surface. It is a combination ink pen, ruler, level, and also has a few angle markings. As most Fisher Space Pens are short and small this cute pen is long and surprisingly easy to wield despite its odd shape. It currently resides on the side of my desktop computer where it should remain easy to find when needed.While it is by no means desirable as your primary writing instrument, it is a multi-use tool with a good pen refill installed making it good to have where you craft and might also need an ink pen. I am glad that I added it to my collection of craft tools."
2,CHILLY,This one just doesn't do it for me. Not a fan of JB Smoove. Maybe I just don't get his comedy.
4,A Newton book to purchase...and keep,"If you plan on buying only a single hardcover photographic book by Helmut Newton I strongly recommend this one. (It probably will not be the last you buy anyway...)The book cover quality is not the best possible but the price is at par with that. Luckily the printed, amply sized pages (279 numbered) are very good. The publisher is TASCHEN, Cologne and the book is printed by EBS, Verona 2000, at least the one I haveThe book contains undisputably many of the icons of Mr. Newtons work the most striking, as always, in monochrome. The book has also several color plates.On page 29 there's a statement that is a guidline for my own, and certainly many others work; ""Nothing has been retouched, nothing electronically altered. I photographed what I saw."""
1,KafkaMania!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the very worst movies yet made by the King of Self-Indulgent Cinema, Woody Allen. Desperately trying to make some kind of Kafkaesque allegory set in an unnamed European city, populated by writers, prostitutes, and clowns, Allen sets a wild new standard for High Pretentious Silliness.Be glad it is out of print."
1,Woody's Big Fall,"Easily one of my top five favourite directors, Woody has never ceased to surprise & stimulate me, be it comically or emotionally. But here, with the exception of his trademark nervous, manic, neurotic that I always love to watch, he falls way too short. Lily Tomlin, Jodie Foster & Kathy Bates all deliver the most dreadful caricatures of prostitutes. Madonna is, well Madonna. John Malkovich is his usual pretentious self. John Cusack is wasted. The only bright spots are the always reliable Donald Pleasance & Julie Kavner, both who exit way too early. An interesting enough story but with way too many holes & nonsensical scenes of forced hilarity. Watch closely for an early William H.Macy as a policeman."
4,A Nice Film,"I'm not a big fan of Woody Allen's more recent films, but this one isn't bad. Allen goes back to re-creating his trademark witty, nervous, and self-identifying character, but the environment around him is atypical of any Allen film I've seen thus far. It's an interesting blend of classic and contemporary Allen.The film is not even close to being as funny as some of his older films, but the scene where he hides in his ex-fiance's house is reminiscent of those days. Still, the film is very watchable, and upon renting it, I found it impossible to resist watching it a second time."
1,NOT REAL BEESWAX,"I thought the description ""raw beeswax"" referred to the ingredients of the candle. It does not. Raw beeswax is the color of the candles. My daughter has severe allergies, so I can only use real beeswax candles in the house. Amazon was really great about returning the product. However, I think the description should clarify that ""raw beeswax"" refers only to the color and not that the candle is made from beeswax."
1,NOT REAL BEESWAX - beware,"Bought some of these candles thinking they were beeswax candles and they are NOT BEESWAX ! Raw beeswax is the color of these candles, seems like a cheap trick to fool us. BEWARE! They are well made petro-based candles, but not really beeswax."
5,"Very classy, nice for entertaining","I use these both in my glass and in brass candlestick holders. They burn for a long time and I like the lack of fragrance at the dinner table. I especially appreciate that they do not drip all over my tablecloth. The color is mellow and seems to go with every linen pattern I own. I received the first box as a gift, but I will definitely buy the next box from Amazon as the price looks better than anywhere else."
5,Another great book from this author.,Author David Vizard is known for other Chev engine building books and this one is just as good.This book caters for the chevy cylinder heads but the tips and techniques can be used on cylinder heads not just Chev.This book has a lot to offer any engine builder.It does get a bit too technical but most people will understand it.Highly recommended.
2,Only slightly helpful,"Although there are some phrases about travel, hotels, and restaurants, much time is wasted on things that are not helpful to the beginner, and especially not to the tourist. Siblings arguing over borrowing money from their grandparents? People gossiping about their friends and describing their living room furniture? Whose idea was this? In any case, there is no systematic approach to the language, nor any serious attempt to help a beginning student learn the basics of vocabulary and sentence building. There are much better choices available, such as ""Learn in Your Car Italian""."
1,Irritatingly disappointing,"""The Frog""'s main character sees the whole world as spinning around him, talks philosophic non-sense since he is only 2 year old and uses everybody around himself in a way that makes himself totally unsympathetic. This book made me wanna put it down after 20 pages. The more I went on and the more I hated it. At the end I could have burnt it. Being able to make a nicely articulated display of the English language doesn't necessarily mean to be a good writer. The story has no plot whatsoever and we only see this stupid boy growing older while the frog he carries in his stomach keeps on being his sexual alter-ego. By the way the story is presented, it is supposed to be a fairy tale, but in this it is totally unsuccessful and it ends up being neither this nor an adult look at the sexual awakening of a young French boy. Don't read it."
4,An old classic,"This is a challenging read, but great to read these classic authors. I've not read Joyce before, but plan to read more."
2,An unpretentious time-killer,"Partly filmed in the relatively unexploited environs of Sofia, Bulgaria, ""Balkan Runner"" is an unabashed B-movie whose makers have no more ambition than to churn out a passable time-killer for those undemanding viewers who have time to kill. It's undistinguished and utterly forgettable but it's competently photographed and edited and it sports an easy-on-the-eyes cast with both male and female eye-candy. Ex-boxer turned actor Stephane Ferrara has two bare-chested bondage scenes in which he's repeatedly punched in the stomach in an attempt to force information from him. The second of these scenes involves Daisy White who knows that the most vulnerable part of a man's anatomy lies somewhat south of his stomach, and it often responds to something other than punches. Most of that action, however, takes place off-screen."
4,Another great compilation!,Another great compilation from The Longines Symphonette Society and a great companion to Volume 1.Track Listing:Dancing in the Streets - Marth and the VandellasMy Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me) - David RuffinThe Way You Do the Things (You Do) - The TemptationsThe Composer - Diana Ross and the SupremesTwenty-Five Miles - Edwin StarrI Heard It Through the Grapevine - Gladys Knight and the PipsShotgun - Junior Walker and the All-StarsWhat Becomes of the Broken-Hearted - Jimmy RuffinDevil With the Blue Dress - Shorty LongThe Answer is Love - Billy Eckstine
1,The Wicked Witch of the Middle East!,"This book tries to present Ashrawi (a Christian Arab woman) as a voice of reason.Unfortunately, Ashrawi's support of Islamic terror has put her squarely against both Christian rights and women's rights. Her role as education minister for Arafat has helped destroy the rights of a generation of Arabs. And if what she's done to her friends isn't bad enough, you might want to see how uncharitable she is to her enemies. She's a voice of irrationality and destruction. It's a shame that it will take more than a Dorothy from the Middle West to undo the damage she's done.Christians are fleeing the Middle East in droves, and Ashrawi is part of the reason. This book should get no stars for failing to show Ashrawi's actual nature."
4,A great book for any person who is interested in sail boats.,This book answered a lot of the questions about how the old ships were rigged. For years I wondered how the mast was stepped. After reading his book I know understand the steps. I would recommend this book to any one with interest in the wooden sail boats.
2,Must have for the spiral feeder. Overpriced if you ask me,"The title says it all. It is what it is, works fine, but costly for a tiny plastic seed tray."
1,Did Not Like,"This was to catch the thistle seed from falling to the ground under my feeder and making a mess, as well as to prevent so much loss of seed. However, with any rain or moisture, the seed would clump all around the tray at the bottom of the feeder, making it hard to clean as well as creating a moldy environment for the birds. I took it off and threw it away."
5,seed tray,"Just exactly as described. I had my doubts, no need. It screwed onto the base of my feeder very easily. I like not having all the excess seed falling on the ground.Fast delivery too."
4,Does the job!,"Takes an extra second or two to get it screwed on straight, but once it's on, the tray does its job well."
2,Very small tray,I must not have read the description carefully. When I purchased this tray I thought it was much larger. This one is so small I can't see how it would be of any benefit. The feeder trays I have on my bird feeders are bigger than this.I will probably give this to someone who has a use for it.
3,"You get what you pay for, but they are not that bad after a few washes.","Created lots of lint in the dryer and on my nicer towels. But, after washing/fabric softener they are very soft. For the price it was worth it. I got them for less than $10. I would not pay more than that for the set. I got the peach ones. They look nice."
3,Not as good as it looks,"the towel set is really a good deal, but it does not as soft & comfortable as it looks like. I guess it is not make by cotton only. The $2.99 bath towel at younkers (thanksgiving sale) is much better!"
2,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap!",Save your money and buy towels of this quality at Wal-Mart. How someone found these towels to be of quality is beyond me
1,horrible,"There is not a star low enough for these towels. They are incredibly cheap with rows of pulled fabric, or missing rows of loops. I was extremely disappointed and promptly called for a refund. I have purchased many, many items over the years from Amazon and have been pleased with my purchases. These are a bust and should be sent back to where they came from. Yuck, yuck, yuck."
1,Horrible towels no matter how cheap,"These towels are are pathetic - they arrived with a damp, moldy smell, then I washed them and although the smell was mostly gone, they came out frayed and practically transparent. I'm not sure how a towel can be NOT absorbent, but they're not! Saving the money is not worth it -- unless you're looking for guest towels for guests you want to get rid of."
1,Don't even buy it at the lower $7.99 price,I bought 3 sets to avail of the free shipping. It has now come back to bite me - I will now have to pay $20 shipping both ways to return this $30 order. I might as well use it as a floor mat. It's definitely not for the body!
3,"Love the towels, didn't love the smell","I bought 3 sets of the same towels which are very attractive,and at a good price. However, they smelled very badly. The odor was acrid and very potent which necessitated washing the towels a couple of times before using (which I would normally do before using new towels anyway). I just hope the smell didn't originate from anything toxic."
1,dont buy it..you will be dissappointed,quality is too low...fabric is very cheap...missing rows...never used them and sent back... i got it for 15 dollars but now they are selling it even cheaper but i wont take them even for free....
2,Low quality,These towels are ... terrible. The least expensive junk towels at Walmart are certainly of higher quality. The towels were falling apart as soon as they were taken out of the box and after ONE delicate wash they are unraveling everywhere.
3,Overrated,"This is supposed to be the South Park of Eastern Europe, and it is, except that I never liked South Park in the first place."
4,A good introduction to the Maya....,"Mr. Gallenkamp's short book provides a good, informative introduction into the history of the Maya. He has included a synopsis of each era, focusing on the Classic; and he gives helpful details about the transitions from one age to the next. He also has written some fascinating chapters about the stories of the churchmen, explorers, and archeologists who first dared define the Maya: Landa, Stephens, Thompson, Ruz, et. al. In my nascent studies of the Maya, this short history has given me enough knowledge and information to feel comfortable while challenging my imagination and curiousity to continue on my journey."
4,Groove Squad...,An entertaining cartoon - I actually liked this one enough to buy it! Who could have figured? 4 stars!
2,I've read better...,"Required text for a journaling course...it's out of print so I bought it used for a good price. I won't be using it again as I didn't find the exercises all that helpful. Not a bad book if you're trying to get some ideas of what to write about, perhaps helpful for some creative writing pieces.Not for me."
1,"Zero Stars, or Negative if it were possible","I agree with Steven Sacks who also reviewed this item. Maybe I got the same one he returned, because it was missing two screws and was very shoddily put together as if the person who assembled it was drunk or on drugs. How on earth anyone would want such a piece of junk is beyond me. It is nothing like the Apple products I own, and putting my $1700 apple monitor on this piece of junk would be like placing it on top of a fly-covered turd. I am returning it today for a refund. This is the worse item I have ever ordered on Amazon and I cannot stress strongly enough that you should avoid it at all costs or you will be sorry."
2,Poor quality,"This item is extremely poor quality. It serves its purpose and looks good from a distance but when you get up close it doesn't live up to its price. I had to send the first one back since it was put together so poorly. The styling may look Applesque but the materials and construction couldn't be any less ""Cupertino""."
2,Could have been great.,"I got this stand for my monitor because it looks great in the photos.Unfortunately once I got it out of the box, it was immediately evident that the quality was not up to par. First off, the stand does not sit level and it wobbles. It also feels like it was slapped together with no care given to making any of the parts line up. The white top was crooked, and the metal legs don't mount flush. I feel like if they gave a little more effort and care into this product, it would be a great item. It's just disappointing how poorly constructed it all was. I really wanted to love this stand, but I ended up just finding it acceptable. For the price, it functions and raises my monitor. It looks fine as long as you don't check too closely. All in all, it does the job, which is why I'm giving this item a 2 star instead of just a one.Next time, I'd pass."
4,Complete and accurate discussion of all the mammals.,"These two volumes provide scientifically accurate information about all the world's mammals, even the most obscure. There are black and white photographs of almost every species, although some of the images are not good quality. Generally the information on each animal covers where it is found, what it eats, social habits, information on mating and rearing young, and a detailed description of size, shape, weight, color, and other physical attributes. The writing is dry and uses a lot of scientific terms. There are extensive bibliographies of the scientific papers used to verify the accuracy of the information; this book is considered one of the best of its kind by scientists who study and work with mammals."
2,Its like a sample CD,"It does have the best songs from Rita Lee and I am a fan, but you will be disapointed since these tracks are shorter versions of the full songs"
1,Flowery & ignores the text,"Love this series, but this one is a flop. Garland launches out from the text and lands in strange places only to repeat the pattern. Save your money and avoid this one."
4,Personal organization made easy and practical,"Davenport provides a comprehensive, easy-to-follow strategy for getting one's life in order. In an increasingly complex world, a simple yet effective method of organization is crucial to one's success and sanity. It doesn't matter what kind of job you have -- or whether you have a job at all -- for Davenport's methods can apply to anyone.One weakness of the book is the rather minimal amount of time spent on e-mail, PDAs and other digital data. At a time when many are cutting back on the use of paper, these media are becoming increasingly important, yet Davenport largely ignores them. She is especially dismissive of PDAs -- something that's become an organizational lifesaver to me and many others -- and those looking for strategies for more effective use of digital media won't find much here. Especially as this is such a recent book, such oversights are surprising; hopefully they will be addressed more thoroughly in future editions."
4,Tackling The Chaos,"This is Author Liz Davenport common-sense approach on organization by utilizing a 6 step method. It's an easy to read, easy to follow guide. I looked at several books on this subject in a bookstore before I chose this one for its straightforwardness and ease of reading.The information is presented in an easy to comprehend way.If you never have time to keep track of where things are in your house this book can help you to start tackling the chaos."
5,Concrete steps to create order,"I found nothing that I considered a remarkable breakthrough in this book. So why give it five stars? After all, there are lots of other similar titles out there.Liz Davenport describes a system that should be required reading for any followers of the 'Four Hour work week' method. While Tim Ferris tells you that you need to reduce the time required to handle paperwork and other tasks that come up, Davenport tells you how. Ferris also recommends outsourcing as much as possible, but most people won't do that. They will, however, be able to reduce the time they spend on chaos and the stress that it causes by following these six steps."
4,Order From Chaos,"Great book. Liz Davenport was a speaker at a recent women's conference in my industry. I used to be a devotee of an electronic planner system, but when I experienced issues with my device, I decided to back it up with a written planner. Liz's plan is great for getting one back on track with organizing their office in a manner that keeps everything important within reach and the less-than-important out of the way. Her session encouraged me to do the obvious: write it down in one place! Get rid of the little notes everywhere. Her system feels simpler than the FranklinCovey system. If you have an industry need for a good speaker, give her a shout."
5,Well worth the money,"I've worked out with Charlene since the 1980's and have most of her videos. I remember her talking about her book with this title. I could never find the book so when I found this old VHS I jumped at it. This is a great hour of tasty low fat recipe's, snack ideas and she cooks everything while talking in her kitchen. Charlene has a great sense of humor (she could easily do a cooking show) and her recipes are easy and look really good! Some of the info is a little outdated - like having to take the skin off the turkey before cooking to reduce the fat content (in one of her later workout videos she said she learned about the membrane around the bird that keeps the fat from soaking in to the meat so you don't have to de-skin it) but for the most part, the information is great and still relevant. Charlene is a perfect blend of 'cute' and 'knowledgable' - you can't help but love her. Now if she'd only get back on the air with more workouts and recipes....."
4,very pretty ring but not for everyone,"This ring was very reasonably priced. The stone was of good quality and color. The amount of silver was more than ample. I am only giving this ring 4 stars because of the design, which I felt lacked balance. All of the marcasite embellishement was to one side, giving it a lop-sided appearance. Another person might find the design lovely. It arrived in a very cute shiney box with an attached bow. It would make a nice surprise in a Christmas stocking for a young girl or teen."
4,An apocalyptic battle on the island of Sark.,"Mr Pye is a raging war between good and evil fought on the island of Sark. Peake's personal experience of living on the island brings the atmosphere to life, the suspicious islanders and the masterful comic icon that is Mr Pye himself. the story is funny and touching, it also gets quite exciting as well. The novel brings a faster movement to his writing. Where Gormenghast is a towering example of how rich the English language can be, Mr Pye creates a quick paced adventure on a small island bursting at the seams with many characters. Gormenghast had plenty of space to hold its characters, Sark doesn't and the addition of a humerous, chirpy and revolutionary missionry gives us even more enjoyment."
5,YANCY JIMENEZ (NANI),"THIS IS WISIN & YANDEL BEST CD OUT!!! BEST SONG'S ON THE CD ARE LLAME PA VERTE, NOCHE DE SEXO AND MIRALA BIEN!! BUT ALL THE SONGS ARE GOOD.. THIS IS ANOTHER OF THE BEST REGGAETONERO'S OUT THERE!! MUCH LOVE AND SUCCESS TO THOSE HISPANIC REGGAETONERO'S!!!!!"
4,GOOD DANCE/EXERCISE CD,"I BOUGHT THIS TO EXERCISE TO, AND TO WAKE ME UP IN THE MORNING. IT FITS THE BILL. YOU GET A LOT OF SONGS ON THIS CD AND THAT'S GOOD TOO."
2,Andy Serkis' Golem is more convincing,"Collins and Pinch think of themselves as cultural anthropologists, watching from the sidelines as scientists debate among themselves trying to understand the world, much as anthropologists might watch a tribe trying to find an elephants' graveyard. They point to the arguments and fudging and messiness that make up emerging scientific knowledge and say ""See! To understand where this knowledge comes from, you really need to understand all this social interaction."" But they never venture out with the natives to see the elephants' graveyard for themselves. Which is not surprising as it may takes years of study to know the right path to get there. But their whole methodology is based on the demonstrably false premise that the existence of the elephants' graveyard is contingent. It is not. It is either there or it isn't."
3,OUTFITTED PLAYERS,"Pzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...slang for ""hey girl, how can I get wit chu? ""(Out fitted players on the cover)Basquiat's pallette is overwelming. This book has many previously unpubllished works by the late artist. Most of the drawings are exceptional...The paintings on the other hand are mostly unresolved. It would have been nice if the images were in FOCUS! But the over all production is good. Leaves me wondering when the rest of his unpublished drawings will see light of day."
3,An iffy album from a Brazilian rock legend,"This is a so-so mid-period album by Brazilian rock star Rita Lee (formerly of the psychedelic band Os Mutantes...) This is jittery late-'70s AOR, with a dash of disco in the mix. By the way, of the many albums entitled ""Rita Lee,"" this one, from 1979, is the one that has the following tracks: ""Chega Mais,"" ""Papai, Me Empresta O Carro,"" ""Doce Vampiro,"" ""Corre-Corre,"" ""Mania de Voc,"" ""Elvira Pag,"" ""Maria Mole"" and ""Arrombou a Festa II."" Not the greatest stuff ever, but if you want to give Lee a fair shake, you might want to check it out."
1,Did not receive,I ordered 3- and only received one. I don't know which on was not received. Please correct. I was charged 10.98. 11.78 and 10.94.
3,"Comments okay, text is small.","I returned this bible, just because the text was too small for my aging eyes. I bought the Thomas Nelson large print version and have to say that I really like Thomas Nelson's commentary much better.The quality of the leather and the pages are fine in the Zondervan edition, but I really do have to say that the Thomas Nelson notes are superb and since I've had both now, I definitely prefer"
4,"same company,but less information.................","Compare to ""Zondervan NIV Study Bible"".""Zondervan NIV Study Bible"" is Better then ""Zondervan KJV Study Bible"". Because I have two of them,so I can say that.And some of the charts or pictures is in ""Zondervan NIV Study Bible"", but Not in ""Zondervan KJV Study Bible"".Two of them are almost same, just in different version.And the ""Zondervan KJV Study Bible"" has less information then ""Zondervan NIV Study Bible"""
4,And then there was 3 and Duke's stepchild,Tony captures the sound of late 70s/ early 80s prog on this one. Some fair to good moments on this solo album. And then there is some awesome moments. One solo excursion with Chester on the drums reminds the listener of the glory days of Genesis. The instrumental tracks on this one are amazing and suggest that Tony should do a whole album of instrumental tracks.
4,Cloth ears,"Not much to say about this albums brilliance except that the nut who thought that Kim Beacon was the sad element on this album probably needs a labotomy, their ears syringed or get a new brain. Kims vocal is as close as you can get to being soul without being black. My single criticism would be a general lack of punch throughout."
3,Frustrating first solo effort.,"For fans of classic Genesis (1969-1975) this first solo album by Tony Banks would seem a Godsend. Let's start with the highpoints....all of the instrumentals are great, especially ""From The Undertow"". ""From The Undertow"" is based on ""Undertow"" which appeared on the first post-Steve Hackett album by Genesis aptly titled ""And Then There Were Three"". What kills this album.....and I really mean kills......are the songs featuring vocals. The vocalist Kim Beacon is an incredibly week attempt at a merger between Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel. Beacon lacks the soulfull intensity of Peter Gabriel and the smoothness of Phil Collins. If you're looking for a good solo album by Tony Banks, look no further than your own backyard. ""A Trick Of The Tail"" the first post-Gabriel release by Genesis is the ticket. Banks either writes or co-writes all of the music on this album. It's an incredible glimpse of what our man is truly capable of."
2,Genisis Outtakes?,Flat and uninteresting. Music for house plants. Has the Genesis sound without any of the wit and musical hooks that made Genesis of that era so interesting to listen to. I can see why his solo musical career went nowhere.
1,Thumbless,"This disc can still be found, with a fair bit of effort, in the neglected bin of an obscure cd/record store. Don't bother making the effort though. Banks was always at his best as a collaborator, a member of the collective group. As a solo artist, he struggles too much to identify a clear musical identity. The fact that he hired such a lifeless, untalented vocalist, doesn't help matters. To find Banks at his most creative listen to any of Genesis' efforts prior to Steve Hackett leaving the band. Selling England by the Pound through Wind and Wuthering are in particular, oustanding recordings. A Curious Feeling is not among his better efforts. Give this one a pass...Simon"
1,pompous,"Another pompous prog rocker with nothing to say, but doesn't mind saying it! this one is the least of all with no real playing skill , no improvisational ability, and an ear for saccharine melody almost as bad as band mate phil collins, I would call this album second hand smoke, or absbestos, : avoid exposure to all !"
4,Works very well.,We had a unusual application in an RV and this mount worked out very well. You might also want to get the back plate if you don't have a solid and sturdy surface to mount it to
5,Perfect,"This white marble paper towel holder was the perfect product for my beloved granddaughter starting in her own house. I have had one for years...it will last, it is not wobbley and displays nicely on any countertop."
5,Nice!,Exceeded my expectations. Sturdy and classy. Worth my money! It was heavy enough to withstand tearing off a sheet of paper towel.
4,Happy,"Great product at a reasonable price. Marble pattern is not all that great but the roll of paper towels covers it up, and so it looks fine. Easy to tear off individual paper towels one handed."
4,The most underrated guitar genius on the planet,"There must be a thousand Hendrix and Jimmy Page cover stories in guitar magazines all over the planet but I don't think you'll have an easy time finding even 3 of STEVE HILLAGE, member of psychedelic-ambient pioneers GONG, and easily one of the top 5 greatest and most original guitarists of the '70s. That's right! Top Friggin' 5! Just listen to this record and if you're not blown away completely by the incredible array of guitar sounds and effects and techniques used, you will definitely qualify to join the world organisation for the tonally deaf!"
2,I just hate digital remasters ...,"Fish Rising is one of the coolest albums ever recorded, and I highly recommend it to anyone who will listen. My low rating is for the digital remaster, NOT the album itself. I stupidly lost my old, hissy, probably-mastered-from-an-LP version of this classic. So, I picked up this new version, not paying much attention to the ""digitally remastered"" part of the album.Look, when you've heard this album as many times as I have, the subtle use of echo slapbacks, phase shifters and distortion becomes part of the song. It doesn't even sound right without the tape hiss. This new version is cleaner, quieter, and has less ""obtrusive special effects"" to ""allow the instruments to be heard better"". Yecch. I hate it. I have the same problem with the digital remaster of Jethro Tull's ""A Passion Play"" too, for all the same reasons. Anybody want to trade my pristine digitally remastered CD for their old, hissy, probably-mastered-from-LP version?"
1,Not Worth purchasing,If you really want a good humidifier try Vicks Dual Humidifier that really put out vapor and it is ez to fill and the clean. I was disappointed by this unit and I do not use it at all. I will give it to my sister for her dorm room because I think it (may) be useful for something that size or possibly a closet space.
3,"easy to assemble, not water tight on the bottom and sides",Received this item. It was easy to assemble. I could see small holes on the bottom and on the side where the pieces fit together. We will be using this to store garden stuff inside a screened lanai so it is not a big issue as far as water tightness. If this were used outside it could be an issue.
4,Good deck box after modifications,"The shipping box was damaged upon arrival. After assembling the deck box I notices gaps in the side seams. I placed a bead of silicone caulking in each of the 4 side seams, wrapped the box with bungies and after 2 days the gaps were sealed. So far the interior has remained dry after many rain storms."
3,Poor design,"This should be a simple item to put together. It is not. Because the parts do not fit together tightly, every timeyou lean against it, it falls apart, and you start all over again. It would be fine if it were a solid box, insteadof a bunch of plastic pieces."
2,rubber madmaid,"While Rubbermaid is a longtime name in the business of plastic ware, I find this box to be a very weak link. Plastic is good but the way it is supposed to slip together somehow doesn't really work. When closed it is good to sit on top but open, it's as flimsy as the day is long, moving everywhere and is crying for either return to the hardwear store or some really good heavy super gluejob. The locking feature is a joke, as all you do is tip it over and bam, the whole top end comes off and all of my goods are there for the picking...just like a big square plastic piñata.Try again Rubbermaid!"
3,Not a bad start,"It's Rubbermaid, so you know it is tough. The assembly went smoothly and everything fit together as it should. However, once assembled, there are gaps at the seams between the 4 different parts that make up the sides and the bottom. Since we live in Southeast Texas, we get a lot of rain, sometimes significant. Assembled as directed, it will not keep out water or bugs. The gaps between the side panels provide a path for the moisture to exit, but if your cushons get wet, they can mildew.To resolve this, I purchased a tube of clear silicon sealer used for sealing seams on the house. I used to to fill all the seams inside the side and bottom of the box and used my finger to ensure they were smooth and filled the gap. The box is water & bug tight now.The only way they could make this product better is to ship with the sealer."
4,Great way to store outdoor toys,We placed the box under the deck and filled it with all of our outdoor toys. Makes cleaning up at the end of the play day a breeze. The box is definitely waterproof and critterproof. We can even lock it if we want to add a padlock.
4,Very Durable,"This is exactly what I was hoping for. I purchased a Rubbermaid small tool shed a few years ago, and it is still in perfect shape. I was hoping this box would be of the same material and workmanship, and it is! It took all of five minutes to assemble and put in place. I am very pleased with the product."
2,I expected much better quality for the price...,"This product does keep items inside dry, and is sturdy enough to sit on when the lid is closed, but that's about the extent of its attributes. I find the design to be very flawed--the four sides of the deck box are separate, modular pieces which more or less ""nest"" together. The first day I assembled the deck box on my 3rd floor condo balcony, a gust of wind blew the lid open, causing the nested sides to shift and the entire thing to collapse. This in turn caused the soft plastic ""hinges"" to bend out of shape, and now whenever I open the lid, the nested pieces pull apart. This deck box would be great if the ""box"" itself were constructed of one solid piece such as a cooler, but as it is now, it's a piece of crap that I can't see lasting more than a couple of seasons at most..."
2,Not very sturdy,"This storage container is not sturdy at all, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wouldn't buy another one of these again.. It doesn't stay together very well."
4,Good size but fit is hit or miss,"We have a few of these. In different sizes. They go together easily. No idea why the first step is knocking out plastic parts. They couldn't do this? Otherwise assembly takes about 60 seconds. We have several of this size box and some have tops that fit perfectly. Others have tops that are too deep and the lock hole doesn't line up. It is weather resistant but not water (or insect) proof. Even when perfectly assembled there are small cracks between the pieces that allow small bugs to enter. So not for dog food or anything like that. Stuff inside stays dry. Also, if you use a lock understand that the lock is just aesthetic. A ten year old could pull the sides or back off to gain access."
4,Great (so far),Easy to assemble. Strong enough to sit on. I am hopeful that the non-continuous seal between lid and base will exclude moisture from dew and mist when rains arrive.
4,Easy to assemble and sturdy.,"This Rubbermaid deck box is lightweight plastic. It comes with a hole on the lid to attach a padlock.Assembly was easy. I didn't like having to punch out the tabs with a hammer and flathead screwdriver, but it wasn't tremendously difficult. The pieces snapped in like they should. I had to have my husband help me with a few of the screws, because the plastic had indentations for the screws but no holes.I'd have liked this deck box to be a little bigger (my fault for not measuring). The back and seat cushions for my four chairs did not all fit. In fact, I could only get the back cushions in.It's a sturdy box. I'm not sure if it leaks. If it survives the next rain, I'll try remember to come back to update.______________________UPDATE 11/29/12: This box still looks new after more than a year. It's raining today and I checked. The box is dry inside, no leaks."
4,"arrived on time, easy assembly",Just the right size for my deck furniture pillows; I decided to caulk it on the inside to make it rain proof; looked like water might get in when we experience hard driving rains. Generally a good buy
1,Poor quality,"This storage unit is the worst that I have ever owned. The sides have 1/8"" gaps at the bottom that will allow rain and bugs to come through, the front panel is rippled due to its thin plastic, and the hinges feel as if they will break after a few weeks of usage. If you lightly shake the box it flexes severely, I will never buy another Rubbermaid product again which is sad because I remember when they use to be a descent quality product."
1,Less than perfect fit,"When the deck box was completely assembled the front holes for the lock didn't line up. Assembly was much mor difficult than expected since the holes in the base need to have their knockouts removed with a hammer and screwdriver. You'll also need a pair of pliers to work the knockouts loose to remove them. The tools required include safety glasses, a piece of 1x4 lumber, a hammer, a standard slotted screwdriver and a philips screwdriver. That's just crazy for something that is supposed to just snap together."
4,Solution to the fall-apart problem,"I had previously reviewed this product with one-start for falling apart all the time. After contacting the company, I was advised to turn the floor of the container over. I did. It solved the problem. The parts fit together much more securely. So give this a shot."
5,Rubbermaid deck storage box,"My intended use of this storage box was to hold chair cushions and bird seed out on my patio. The item arrived in a very timely manner and was incredibly easy to put together. It took a total of 15 minutes from opening the box to completion.After having read several others reviews I was a bit wary of the waterproof abilities of the box. Now, after several hard and windy rain storms I can say that everything in the box stayed perfectly dry. I did purchase a clip to hold the lid down so that wind and squirrels would not allow it to be raised.There is sufficient room in the box to hold the four 3"" seat cushions, two containers of bird seed, a little fire pot, and a few other small items. The box is quite sturdy and the pieces fit together snuggly. I would certainly recommend this item."
5,Great box and easy to assemble,"I was pleasantly surprised by this box. It was easy to put together, very spacious, and it keeps things dry."
5,You can't beat it for the price,You Can't beat it for the price and I came in lightning speed! I was super easy to put together!
2,Won't stay together,"I've had this deck box for just over a year now, and I can't recommend it to anyone. The box just won't stay together. Side panels pop apart, each time it is put back together, it happens again. Size is nice, but it's just not made well."
1,Design Flaws,"This product consists of 6 main pieces: lid, bottom, 2 ends and 2 sides. The ends and sides have absolutely no locking mechanism. When moving, attempting to pick up, or even open the lid at times, the unit falls completely apart. It was necessary to insert screws in all pieces except the top, in order to make the product functional. I would absolutely not recommend it."
3,STORAGE BOX,IT DOESN'T STAY TOGETHER. IT KEEPS COMING APART EVERY TIME I OPEN IT. ITS MADE OF GOOD PLASTIC AND IS STRONG. I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO FIND A GLUE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER
4,Not waterproof,"This is a great storage chest, but I would prefer more water-resistance.Assembly was very simple, all the pieces simply snap together (except the lid which uses some supplied hardware)Very large on the inside (I can fit 5 bags of charcoal with plenty of room on the side for cooking tools)Water could likely run in through the vertical seams along the corners however it does seem otherwise weather resistant.I keep the charcoal in a separate container inside to prevent water from getting on the bags."
1,Rubbermaid storage bin,"i bought this bin to store my recyclables, and it does the job but i believe the bin that i received had been used before and returned. The screws were already placed in the holes, but incorrectly. Somehow the cover is not aligned with the hole designed for a lock, so a lock will not fit. It appears that once this item was returned by the previous owner, it was sent to me without being inspected. This was an expensive plastic bin, and I expected a better product. I had to get help in order to assemble because of the mess it was in when shipped. Very poor quality control. I would have returned it, but that was an additional hassle and expense. I am brand new to the amazon.com world, but i will definitely think long and hard before another purchase."
2,"A big, delicate plastic box","PROS:Fairly bigLightweightSnap togetherWaterproof from overhanging lidI guess you could sit on itCONS:PriceNot big enough for JUST seat cushions from 4 outdoor chairs-- let alone all the cushionsSnap together -- Will fall apart if you try to ""cram it"" fullCurrently holding JUST the back support cushions from 4 patio chairs-- it's actually a small-ish box for this kind of job. Probably better to just hold small random items."
2,A disappointment for a heavy-duty binder,"Who hasn't opened a looseleaf binder by the rings and not by the lever? The mechanism should accommodate that, but because I tried to open this binder by the center ring, it is ruined, with a gap of more than an eighth of an inch which won't bend back despite all my efforts. It may still be useable if used to hold stiff cardboard reference materials, but thin sheet protectors need to be able to slide over all three rings.I am therefore disappointed with this binder."
2,Disappointed,"Initially I was very happy with this product. I bought this for my 11 year old son for school. It is very easy to open and shut the rings and the binder itself was nice and sturdy. However, only after 1 month of school, the bottom ring does not shut and the middle one now has a small gap. My son has to carefully flip each folder and notebook in the binder, which like most 11 year old boys, patience is a little difficult. Therefore, folders and papers are starting to get ripped. My son is careful with his property, he has not abused the binder. I will have to buy another binder and I am only one month into the school year. Very disappointed!"
5,The King Of All Binders!,This binder is extremely durable while stile being quite lightweight. Quite resistant to wear/tear and smudging.No complaints here!
5,Hardcore Binding Action,"Binder choice can make a surprisingly big difference. I think most of us have struggled with binders that don't hold enough, are difficult to open or close, bend pages, or fall apart. While these seem like simple issues to address, it is quite a joy to have a binder that does. This binder has one button to easily open the ring, though you need to push on the rings to close them as usual. The button works perfectly and feels sturdy. The ring itself is D-shaped to prevent paper bending. The cover is PVC free (good for photos) and there are also four pockets on the inside. I really have no issues with the binder, other than how bad it makes my other binders look. Two ""box tops for education"" are included."
2,Legs and arms kept falling out,"This binder was ok for one or two women, but I couldn't get it full without the arms and legs sticking out. If you want a whole binder full of women, you will be better off getting the ""Case-it Large Capacity 3-Inch Zipper Binder."" You can fill it with women and the zipper keeps everything neatly inside. Walking around with a messy binder is just unprofessional."
4,Pretty Heavy,"I ordered this last week, thing must have weighed 300 lbs, then I found out it had two women in it. Once I told them this was the 21st century not the 14th they left and now it can fit papers or other office supplies with ease."
1,Not Gap Free!,I use this binder for school to keep my papers organized and it is thrown in my backpack everyday. The binder is durable and sturdy but with one big problem. The rings develop gaps unlike what the description says. I do not open the rings by prying the rings open i use the opener tab. I thought i got a bad one so i bought another one only for the same problem to develop. I never had this problem with the durable line of binders the same company sells. I just think the overall quality is not worth the high price.
2,She asked me to return it. Didn't like the color,"Then again, she is a woman - like I even listen to them. One additional feature such as soundproofing would have been a nice touch. Other than that, it's basic and travels well to the cayman islands."
4,Excellent for long term storage,"This binder is one of those binder you want to get to store papers for a long time (i.e., tax receipts, bank papers). While I have not had it very long, I can tell it is one that would hold up well to repeated usuage. I used mine to hold bank statements from three separate acccounts (I had to supplu my own dividers) and was able to store two years worth of all three with ample room for growth. The pockets in the front and back are also handy. I use mine to store this month's statements before I reconcile my accounts. I would buy more of these binders."
3,"Not exactly sure how this qualifies as ""Heavy Duty""","It's about as basic as it gets. It's a 3-ring binder. It opens. It closes. It's plastic. It's $8. It's an unremarakable, plastic, basic, typical binder."
2,Not heavy duty,"Do not buy if you intend to use heavily - in class, etc. - cover easily separates from spine. Mine is now duct-taped together."
1,Colors offered not suitable for women,"Grey? Black? White? Navy Blue? WTF?This binder is rated ""one star"" for color selection. I'll reconsider it's score once it's offered in appropriately gendered-colors such as: bubble gum pink, hot pink and pale pink with options for glitter.Bonus points if these binders are produced in rainbow motif to be used for ""binders of gays."""
5,Easiest To Open Binder I Have Ever Had,"This is a well made binder that should last a long time. Binders are a pretty basic item, but as this binder demonstrates, some are much better than others. Some thought has obviously gone into the design. For one thing, the rings open easier than any binder I have owned and they close easily, perfectly aligned, with a satisfying ""snap"". Avery guarantees that there will never be a gap, which is a huge plus since many binders of this size that I have had in the past developed a gap that make it difficult to turn the pages. The rings are ""D"" shaped which Avery says will hold 50% more than the round rings, and looking at them I can see that this is right. On the inside of both the font and back cover are 2 pockets. This is a high quality binder at a good price; if you need a binder of this size, this would be a good choice."
2,Didn't care for it,"This story should have been ONE book. The fact that it was split into two only dragged it out long past the sell-by date. There are too many characters--too many races-- in this book to keep straight, and after a while I just quit trying to remember who's who; they weren't all that important, anyway. You're familiar with the saying ""his eyes are bigger than his stomach""? Well, this author's ambitions are bigger than his delivery. (In my opinion.) Bottom line: if this two-book story were chopped in half and fit into a single book, it would have been much better.(This same review appears on the page of Book One.)"
3,good but not great,Is it a pannel saw no! Is it convinent yes. Festool is much better but a lot more money. If you rip a 8' board wood grain will defect the guide and the saw. You will need to mount the guides as instructed in the manual. Be sure to use a string to keep it lined up as you mount it to your plywood guide. This will help keep the guide from defecting. You might call the manufacture and find out the best fitting saw. You will prety much need a dedicated saw.
1,Made a mess.....,"Get a real panel saw!!! This thing slipped at the edges, put large dents in my wood when it held, bowed in the center where the two pieces of angle were joined. Basically, you might as well use a piece of iron and a couple clamps. It is definitely not for precision work. I wrecked 2 sheets of plywood (1/4"" off in the center of an 8' pieces and up to 1/4"" slip on the end) before I decided to borrow a real cabinet saw. I would definitely not recommend it for anything."
1,Received item broken in transit TWO times,I ordered this item TWO seperate times and received BROKEN boxes each delivery. This was a present and I was very disappointed with the manner in which it was packaged for delivery.I canceled the item after the second one arrived broken.
5,MUST HAVE CD OF THE DECADE!,"ruse of fools are the best band in PA. Mr mark G has the best writing and singing skills out there today, if not beter them half of all the stuff on mtv. The band as a whole perform great. With bob and charlie on guitars, john on bass, me lee Z. dash on drums and the wonderfull markie G on lead vocals and guitar. the whole bands works and look awwsome and have killer songs. a must have cd, you will like it! but it, play it, share it, and see the live shows!"
1,Disappointing,"I never imagined that Lonely Planet Taiwan could be so bad, but it indeed is. For instance, maps in the book are useless, and the Taipei metro direction is unclear and useless. And I cannot understand why the author says "" For sth really special you can try Haagen Daz.""I didn;t belive the previous reviews, and now I learned how bad it is.If you need more information, lots of Taiwanese websites provide very useful information. You can just go to Taiwanese consular office website and find the links."
1,Love foodcourts?,"I have to begin by admitting that I love to hate the tone of some Lonely Planet guides--an edition for Japan from the early 1990s distinguished itself by one of author's disdain for touring Japan!That being said, Robert Storey's take on Taiwan (where I've been living for the past year or so) is remarkable for its general laziness. Many examples have been noted in other online reviews, but it's worth mentioning some of them again: the overwhelming focus on ""ex-pat"" hangouts, the author's love of foodcourts located next to train stations, and the compulsive need to mention that we can find McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway, and so on in Taiwan's major urban centers.What's left behind in all this is the astonishing beauty of parts of Taiwan, the compexity of its history and its social formations, and the genuine warmth of its people.To Lonely Planet: please find someone who actually cares about this place to research and write an edition that Taiwan and its visitors deserve!"
2,Lacks even the most essential practical information,"Taiwan being one of the few Asian countries I have not yet been to, I bought this book for advance planning.It has already failed even before leaving home!When trying to estimate travel costs by looking for long-distance bus fares, I could hardly believe they were not given! In the ""Getting There & Away"" section after each town/destination, it was merely mentioned that buses do run there (surprise, surprise!), but no information on how long they take and how much they cost.That is exactly the kind of practical information people usually buy Lonely Planet guides for, and I don't think I have ever seen another LP guide that didn't have them...The 2 stars were given as it does give information about major sights, but given how poorly-researched the practical information is, I would be surprised if the rest was accurate.This may just be the worst LP guide of all."
2,Worthless for anyone who wants to see the REAL Taiwan!,"As an American who spent many years in Taiwan, I found this book to offer little to no insight into Taiwan at all. A far better source for anyone who wants to learn about this wonderful island NATION (not renegade province of China) ""Culture Shock -Taiwan.""In Tapiei, Taiwan you can also buy a lot of great travel books at Caves Books that are published by local publishers in English (""Formassan Odyssey"" is GREAT!!!)The cultural information presented in this ""Lonely Planet"" guide is pretty out of date (my Taiwanese in-laws had a good laugh at some of the information presented), and the many of the destinations offered are VERY tourist centered. If you are looking for a starting point this book is OK, but if you want to learn about Taiwan, or really experience Taiwan today there are far better sources.For a Lonely Planet guide this book is a shame. A new version is needed badly. No matter what, DO GO TO TAIWAN, it is a great place!!!"
3,"read the book, but don't pack it for the trip.","this text offers some informative insights for a greater understanding of formosa, taiwan r.o.c.. i recommend reading this book to become acquinted with urban and rural customs. read the book but don't pack it for the trip - if you follow this book (or any other) you'll miss the wonders of detail, suprise, and enlightment.i suggest flying to the international airport in kaohsiung, spending a few days, take a slow train north along the eastern coast and visit taipei. taichung city (west coast, central) is much more comfortable, and less foreigners are found."
3,Wondering if you should read this companion to the Darksword trilogy?,"Darksword Adventures was originally written as a role-playing game supplement based on the Darksword trilogy. As a result, I very nearly bypassed it, since I am not interested in the gaming aspect of Darksword. After thumbing through the book, I decided to buy it and I do not regret it.Although there is a lot of gaming info in the book, it is easy to skip. Included with the gaming information is a lot of history and explanation of magic in the Darksword world. Anyone who enjoyed reading the trilogy should find this information helpful and interesting.This book is not essential, but if you are thinking about re-reading the trilogy someday, reading Darksword Adventures first may help to fill in some holes and improve the experience."
5,tips for having fun together- yes it's possible,"Anne Mayer offers the nuts and bolts of getting away together for an evening or weekend as well as ideas for keeping romance alive everyday, it was very informative for keeping love alive while being nuturing parents too, i definitely would recommend this book to all parents."
4,On or Off,"I put this mic to work the day I got it. Its way different from a 58. No Prox field what so ever its on or off, almost like a gate is on it. Its a good background vocal mic, but might be a little thin for lead. I am a country singer so thats from a ""country music"" stand point. If you dont sing hard then this mic would be good for you, but if you got pipes, You dont need it."
5,Love this product~,"This Shure Beta 87A microphone has a clear concise sound that is perfect for female singers. The clarity of the voice is picked up like I have never seen in a mic before. Very good choice if you have a wide range of vocal nuances, or tend to be a quieter singer, this mic will pick up all the great qualities of your voice! Great product!"
1,Not good,This book was unfortuantely a complete waste of time... I say unfortunately because I just had a book report to do on it and it was just painful to read. Ms. Anderson is off the mark in a few areas in this book.I do recommend it to all the feminists out there...
5,faustina.,"great movie but wish I could find a way on how to buy the english version without its subtitles. I did see it on EWTN in this format, but cannot for the life of me find where to buy it! Otherwise, the acting and contents of this film were inspiring and very real. Great performance from the actors, too. It's make you feel as if you could also have the potential to achieve sainthood if we just ""trust and accept"". Two very hard words to live by."
3,"The Film of Saint Faustina is good, but the language selection buttons don't work.","The film is excellent, the only thing I didn't like is that the movie didn't highlight the option of English or Spanish, so It was hard to select the language, but finally after trying to put the button without highlight it, I got it."
5,St. Faustina is the Greatest,"Excellent service and delivery. although I would perfer this to be in English. If I had known not in English, would not have purchased item. But What a Great Story."
4,Fascinating and fun,"This is later Nero Wolfe, written in the 50s, filled with references to the Eisenhower administration. And this is noteworthy because I've always found the later Wolfe adventures lacking in charm and energy. Not this one. Archie finds himself in the publishing world, helping Wolfe sort out scandals, plagarism and murder. The setting is unique, the plot is engaging, Wolfe is his familiar old idiosyncratic self, and Archie is as witty a narrator as you could ask for. I was pleasantly surprised and delighted by this work."
3,Nero Wolfe comes through in the end...,"Nero Wolfe is hired to investigate several claims of plagiarism against best-selling authors. Many murders ensue.For the first half of the book, I was frustrated by Wolfe's childish behavior. It seemed Archie Goodwin, not Wolfe, could be the real brains of the operation - he does all the legwork anyway! But toward the end Wolfe came through as the genius he is known to be, and all was right with the world. (This is only my 3rd Wolfe mystery and I have a feeling this might be a recurring theme in this series...) I did guess the murderer early on, but it didn't spoil the effect for me.The mystery was well done and I enjoyed the books/writing/author setting for the story."
4,a very good plot,the plot is amazing. Rex Stout has been one of the best writers I have ever read nowadays.
3,Not Bad,"This is the only Nero Wolfe mystery I've ever read. I happened to come across it in the library & thought I'd give it a try. It is well-written and the characters and plot are interesting. The logic involved in solving the mystery was somewhat abstruse, however, and although 3 people were killed, there was little direct action. This was a book worth reading, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
1,Bored Disappointed reader,"The author Melley must be seriously delusional if he thinks this book is readable! After reading a few pages of his intro, I had to skip ahead. I had to find justification of me shelling out more than $25 bucks for this hunk of ink on paper. Guess what? There was none! I tried in vain to find something, anything of interest but failed miserably. Don't waste your time or money!"
4,Pleased with Product,"I requested an air purification system from my apartment management a few years ago when my son was small and we were getting a lot of second-hand smoke from our neighbor's apartment. We received two of these Honeywell models for our 600 sq. ft. apartment and immediately noticed an improvement! (We had a town-house, and we placed one downstairs, one upstairs.) I think you can stretch the recommended square footage a little, as long as you let the purifier run 24/7 and keep the doors and windows closed. Overall, I recommend the product, but suspect that there may be new, improved versions on the market (and now that I've moved into a bigger place, I plan to purchase one with the capacity to clean a larger space)"
1,Daughter,"To whom it may concern,The item arrived within the time frame promised. I am however very disappointed as there is NO resemblance to the Lily of the Valley delightful smell. I have had another bottle (diferent make) but can no longer find the brand. Having bought Yardley products before which were all fine, I am quite disappointed and I would not recommend this one to anyone. I love the smell of Lily of the Valley flowers. I used to go into the woods where I lived to pick the in the wild. Wish I could give you a better recommendation. If anybody knows of a brand which is a true Lily of the Vally product please let me know.Eva Snuffer"
5,Cotton Dermatological Gloves,"My wife has had a recurring skin condition for years. It requires steroid creams to be used each time until it clears up. She says ""the cream is super oily and it takes a while for it to soak in. These gloves are comfortable and allow the air to circulate also until the medicine is fully absorbed. They wash easily and don't shrink! Very pleased with them."""
5,Great quality for as cheap as they are,"Had to buy these online, because I couldn't seem to find any in the town where I live. It'd be nice if you had the option of picking a size because the fingers are a little long, but since that is a problem I usually run into with gloves that's not a surprise. The gloves do cover my wrist, so the person who said they didn't probably just needed a large rather than the medium that's automatically sent. Despite the fact that they are a little big they do fit well enough that I'm able to wear them while typing this review. The gloves look really durable, especially with as inexpensive as they are."
1,Sloppy Fit,"Like the fabric, HATE the fit. The fit was sloppy and huge around the wrist. I wear them at night for an eczema issue and one actually came off during the night. Try the ones at Dollar Tree; these are the only ones that work for me."
4,Functional,Very nice product. Only qualm is that they are a little big around the wrist..almost as if they have been stretched out. Elastic at the ends of the gloves would be a more worthwhile production.
3,"They're okay, I guess.","I bought these to keep steroid cream on my hands (and off my clothes and sheets) while I was treating a bout of psoriasis. While they did keep the cream from getting on things, and did help protect my hands inside rubber gardening gloves, they quickly shrank in the wash, and while they fit on either hand, that lack of handed-ness kept them from ever being comfortable on either hand. I have average sized hands for a woman and they barely cover my palms. Didn't cost much though so my complaints are kind of weak."
3,"Very small, very thin, but work ok","These gloves at very tiny. They stretch to fit, mostly, but aren't very comfy, and the wrist isn't covered at all. They're very thin also and seem to absorb more of the lotion than anything else. However, they've washed three times now and come out the same and haven't torn up yet."
2,Disappointing,"The gloves are pretty thin and stretch out at the wrist. Once washed, they stretch out even more and the lotion on my hands leaks thru them."
4,Meguiar's M4616 Gold Teak Oil - 16 oz.,My teak products have been treated & look beautiful. It appears this oil is keeping the products from cracking and giving them a luxurious sheen.
5,Maguiars Gold Teak Oil,"Product was easy to apply, and after a month of outdoor weather, it is holding up well on my two benches."
2,Just OK.,Needs to be reapplied very often. Looks good for a few days and then fades again. I will try something different/more expensive next time.
5,Good Stuff,"Used on my outdoor furniture...can take your greyished, weathered teak back to its golden days."
5,Polish for my furniture......,"When I purchase the Meguiar's Gold Teak Oil, I do not know how good it is, just thought of polishing my furniture.Soon after I applied it for the first time, I was really surprised on how good a job I did....no, should be how good a job Meguiar's Gold Teak Oil did.I would recommend to anyone, this product is good for both outdoor and indoor, apply multiple times(allow time to dry each layer) if wood surface is really dull. For maintenance, one layer should be sufficient."
3,Did its job - for a couple of months,"Bought this stuff to treat a 60"" round teak patio table and 6 chair set. Used almost the whole bottle and it made the furniture look really good. We applied it with a rag, as per the instructions but that's a waste of time - it took about 2 hours. Next time I'm going to use a pump spray bottle to apply it and then use the rag or a paintbrush to work it in.I reckon that ideally, the patio furniture should be submerged in this stuff overnight but that would be prohibitively expensive to facilitate. As it is, a couple of months of light spring rain and sun and it's almost faded back to the bare wood again."
3,Rise and fall of a giant,"The album starts very well, and there are some very good songs. However, the overall album simply did not measure up to the bands reputation. Some of the songs were very reminiscent of Renato's Italian solo album ""Equilibrio Distante."" ""A Tempestade"" is strictly for long-time Legiao Urbana fans, and not for those looking to familiarize with the band."
3,The little ones will like it.,"On the day we got this my son (age 6 1/2) watched it three times, and he laughed at a lot of the gags, even the third time around. Adults may be able to chuckle once or twice but mostly they will wish they were watching the 1950's TV version of Dennis, which in my opinion was much funnier and had more charm.Although the DVD is region code 1, there were no problems playing it on a European DVD player which had been switched to codefree use."
3,Abrasive And Chaotic,"Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller) was a great comeback for Van Vliet,but unfortunately I can't be as enthusiastic about this follow-up to that great record. I rarely listen to Doc At The Radar Station,which received praise from all over back when it was released in 1980, although I admit it has it's moments, ""Ashtray Heart"" being my favorite. Too much off it chugs along in a similar abrasive manor that makes one's ears tired at the end. Eric Drew Feldman's mellotron seems strangely out of place and innapropriate in the spots where it appears.I think Ice Cream For Crow was an improvement over Doc,much more accessible certainly, despite what anyone says.If you want to appreciate Beefheart,don't make Doc your first purchase."
3,Long Live the Captain!,well I have had many records by the Captian this one was dissapointing hot head ashray heart great tracks but then he goes totaly manic not with all the tracks but some are out there I still feel that clear spot was his finest album ever great tracks all the way through.
5,classic beefheart,"his best album since lick me decals off baby, it's back to 'hard to listen to music' . great musicianship of course. Bruce fowler on trombone is one of my faves. there is great rhythm on this album. standouts are 'sue egypt' 'run paint' 'dirty blue gene'"
1,Over-inflated ego..,"Somebody bought this book at my company. I already had a bad feeling as I read the feeble attempt at a poem at the start. As a newcomer to BizTalk, I'm looking for something practical to get me started building new systems and really understanding what makes such systems tick. All I found was pages and pages of abstract waffle, which left me with the question; so what? This is supposed to be a ""complete technical guide"" - a technical guide to what? on how to bore programmers perhaps, certainly not on BizTalk. Also; that Mr. Kobielus finds it so necessary to do this pathetic kind of pseudo-marketing seen here is, in my opinion, very sad and certainly adds nothing to his credence."
1,"Use ""Google""","This book might be good for high-level manager, however, a technologist is better off using the web to get more information than presented in this book."
5,Good product & good purchase,"Excelent delivery time & excelent product. As a singer i worked with shure since I started, and i have to tell I like much more than Shure 58. thanks!"
2,"Good sound, fell apart after a few uses.","I was very excited about the sound quality of this microphone. Unfortunately, after fewer than a dozen uses, disconnecting the microphone cable resulted in yanking out the bottom connector. This turns out to be a bear of a repair (soldering small wires on both ends). Be sure to check that the set screw on the bottom connector is not turned in too far. I never noticed and ouch!"
1,"awful, god awful.","This is the worst thing to happen to webcomics since....wait, did you say Toothpaste for Dinner?My bad, I thought you said Natalie Dee.But yeah, Toothpaste is one of the best webcomics out there. This book is great."
2,Lasted almost 1 year,"The product saved me from burning great cuts of meet a number of times over the past year so it is better than nothing, but thne unit failed within a year - constantly beeping telling me that the meat was Overcooked and no longer registering tempaerature just showing Hi so it is now unuseable - wish the remote unit had more functionality similar to the base unit which hard wired to the probe."
1,Look elsewhere for accuracy,"As an independent, this book makes one lean to the left. Most troubling is that Limbaugh's assertions are rarely supported by accurate facts. Any book espousing a philosophy and attempting to refute another obviously should contain end notes to verify the assertions. His errors are too numerous to detail here and a better summary of the conservative philosophy can be found elsewhere."
1,"Stop lying about my people, Limbaugh","As an Apache shaman I still encounter many lies and fallacies about my tribe and others. The most disgusting by far is that perpertrated by Rush Hudson Limbaugh III. Who in their right minds would believe that there are more Indians alive today than when Columbus landed? I DO concede that the primary causes of my people's deaths were the diseases contracted from the European settlers. However, this does NOT justify Limbaugh lying about our current population statistics."
3,taeguwill@hotmail.com,"What is the context that Limbaugh means when he refers to feminists as ""feminazis"". I'm trying to be openminded, but I can't equate being liberal as the same thing as commiting racial geniocide. What is the point you are trying to get at. Are you just using ridculous language to get people angry at you?"
1,Pray For Me?,"I guess we are all supposed to pray for Limbaugh, the Mr. Know-It-All with a 1 year college education and no children or real life experiences."
1,This is not a Good Book,"Rush would make a great used car salesman, but don't look to him for be leader of ideas for this country. He's too cynical andpartisan to be ever be taken seriously. Sorry, Rush, you're ideas are not inclusive, they are divisive.Too bad Paul Wellstone is not still around. It would have been great to see a debate between the two of you."
5,A smashing use of wit and realism.,"Rush Limbaugh comes through once again with political entertainment unparalelled. With The Way Things Ought To Be, Rush points out the flaws of liberalism, the triumph of the Reagan years, and the flops of the Clinton Presidency. A must have if you agree with him or not"
4,good humor man,"If you like his show you will love his book. Hilarious, occaisionally rather touching. His thoughts on radio and defending his career from pressure groups by taking it to the streets was very interesting and something I didn't expect him to discuss. As another reader said, it was also an interesting snapshot of life in the eighties. I suppose if you disagree with his politics, you would find this book maddeningly irritating. It is not, after all, a book of philosophy or poly sci; it doesn't make complete argument, so much as smart alecky editorializing. It's rather like the right wing version of the dennis millers rants, with perhaps slightly more attempt at persuasion thrown in.Ultimately there's no sitting on the fence; you love this guy, or hate him. and you'll judge his book the same way."
4,One Big Suprise,"I am an unabashed liberal and can not stand this man, but I read his book anyway. I found it to be suprisingly intelligent and well written. I disagreed with most major points, but not because of the way they were stated."
5,Rush at his finest!,"Amazing read! Rush rectifies the mis-representation that the main stream media works so hard to spread about him. If you believe what the media and other say about him, I would highly suggest reading his books to learn what he really believes."
4,Rush is Right!,"I am a Republican...but not a far-to-the-right conservative idealogue. I'm a moderate Libertarian Republican. So I've never been a fan of the bluster and extremeism of the right-wing talkers. I rarely listen to Rush or any of the talkers. But this book is ""right on the money."" I implore those who think Rush is too far to the right, to read this book with an open mind. Great stuff! I'm a Rush fan forever after reading ""The Way Things Ought To Be."""
3,Unsurprising,"A man trying to tell a crowd that they are badly governed will never be unpopular. That given, Rush Limbaugh's popularity should surprise no one. On some things he makes sense. On some, notably on science issues, he's got his head up his... If you don't know he's conservative you've been living under a rock for years now, and if you've heard his radio show even once, nothing in this book should surprise you in the least."
3,Upset,"The book did appear to be new as stated, however the pages in the booked looked and felt as if they had been wet at one time.I bought this as a gift to go with the autographed picture I bought from another dealer and I was very upset that it looked like this."
1,This is your mind!,This is your mind on drugs!Remember: The right wing tells lies. The wing right wants to take your money so they can buy drugs. Ignore them!
1,Not very good at all,"Over here in Britain, we have some experience of people like Rush Limbaugh. During World War Two, we had broadcast to us from Nazi Germany the ravings of an unpleasant little man called William Joyce. Courtesy of Goebbels, this nonentity spouted hatred of Britain, our independence and democracy, all the while claiming that he was a better patriot than those of us who were fighting to defend our beloved country from Hitler's aggression and tyranny. For some reason, Limbaugh's rants remind me of Joyce - who was hanged as a traitor at the end of the war."
1,Answer me this,"If Limbaugh is so smart (and so popular), why is the first of only two books he's written in the last decade already out of print and only available in tapes-for-the-illiterate form?"
1,The world according to the king of morality !,"A miserable book ! Rush Limbaugh is a media creation, a puppet figure, and a loud mouth that has been well used by the political elites for years to advance their own agenda. However, they should've hired better writers to write Limbaugh's book. It makes you wonder where Rush would be without his cue cards, his writers, and his editors, and even with them this book is a flop.Limbaugh, the king of morality that preached for years about virtue, conservatism, and the way thing ought to be, somehow was able to find the inner strength and the time to manage as well as to balance his morality with his drug dealings and drug abuse!!!Rush Limbaugh is a great role model for the intellectually dishonest, and a great symbol for the mendacious media !!"
1,If Only He Could Write...,I will keep this review shortand simple: Rush Limbaugh writes like a grade school child. He often had run-on sentences and sentence fragments. It was utterly PATHETIC
3,One Person's Opinion,"I thought the book did an average job of conveying the opinions of the author. It was partisan, but I don't think Mr. Limbaugh has made any effort to conceal his partisanship. Some of his opinions, I agree with. Others, I do not agree with. But I will defend to the death his right to state them, my right to buy the book, to read it and to comment on it. Zero (0) ratings and a resounding ""boo""should go to reviewers who cannot set aside their personal reactions to Mr. Limbaugh and who show their ignorance by mean-spirited name calling, i.e, ""pompous windbag."" Some of our most popular public officials could be described as such, but, hopefully, their writings of their ideas and opinions are treated with some objectivity in the review process."
2,"Limbaugh, unamerican","The book highlights the hypocrisy of today's right wing talk show host: the author romanticizes war without having fought, pushes tax cuts that assist no one but himself and his elite friends, advocates cuts in education knowing his family will never need public education and launches unamerican personal attacks on political opponents in the name of ""patriotism."""
2,Blind Man Rush,"There is a parable of the blind men and the elephant. Blind men are trying to describe an elephant. One man grabs its trunk, another its ear, another its tail, another its leg and so on. Each thinks he's describing the whole elephant and that the others are just plain wrong. Blind man Rush has done a very good job of describing the elephant's left nut and I'm in general agreement with his description - but it ain't the whole damn elephant. To my mind Rush's political philosophy (If I can use such a weighty term to describe Rush's incoherent ramblings) is to a large degree reactionary, motivated primarily by nothing more than anti-liberalism. And by continually taking the most absurd examples of left-wing lunacy it's really no challenge to discredit it. Nor is it very useful to continually dwell on it."
2,"Good Guy, Bad Book","While I do not agree with many of Rush's opinions, it is impossible to deny that, in some cases, he presents them with great skill. However, in this book it was almost impossible to find the opinions worth hearing. While padding time between good points with rants about feminism might work on the radio, in a book it is woefully intolerable, to the point where you, like I, may need to find a quiet, dark room to lie until your headache subsides."
1,Not as good as one hoped,"Although not conservatively inclined I looked forward to reading this book as I thought that it would be like P J O Rourke, witty bitting and funny. In Australia we do not get Mr Limbaughs program but its reputation is considerable and the author is said to be something of a wit. It was thus a disspointment to labour through the book. The writers background is apparently that of a disk jockey. Most of the book is rather anecdotal and all over the place. The jokes are laboured and long winded.The attraction of the book is hard for an outsider to see. It probably says something more to people caught up issues. To a non American it just seems to be another "" I don't want to pay tax and anyone who wants me to show some social responsability is a commie"" type tract."
1,Druggie Limbaugh Strikes Again,"This book was ridiculous. I would highly suggest a more intellectual view of politics by a man with true talent instead -- Al Franken. get his books, they are better and full of truth, unlike Druggie Limbaugh!"
2,Long-time listener - first (and last) time reader,"I'll admit -- I don't like Rush one bit. I listen to his show to find out what the creepy side of America is being told to think. But I did check out this book, and it's slightly better than I expected. That is to say, it's considerably better than Michael Savage, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly or Ann Coulter's stuff. He doesn't rant or rave.But still, I found very little in this book that is true or accurate or even honest. IMO, if you don't buy into his prejudices already, you won't find much to agree with."
5,Excellent! Must read for teachers,"As a teacher, I have been frustrated the last few years with our extreme focus on raising test scores in public education. I've had this overwhelming feeling that ""something's not quite right ,"" but haven't been able to put my finger on what it is or why. Kohn has studied the issue and has articulated exactly what's going on and the folly of it all. If you've noticed something's amiss as well, you will find the first part of his book validating and enlightening,even if you don't want to wholeheartedly embrace authentic assessment in place of objective, standardized tests.What Happened to Recess and Why Are Our Kids Struggling in Kindergarten? by Ohanian is also very good."
4,An Educators Delight,"This book sheds light on the cases against standardized testing. As a future educator, I was please that my Professor chose this book. Riddled with great arguements against standard testing, it was a great jumping off point for papers and other class discussions. All future-educators should check this book out and see why standardized testing may be hindering our children's learning."
1,"So, what's the alternative Alfie?","I have only one problem with Alfie and his material -- he has absolutely zero credientials in this field! He's never been a teacher and he has no certifications or degrees in education! He's an armchair general pointing out all the flaws with accountability and assessment and providing no VIABLE alternataives. Assessment and accountability are here to stay. So the question is: do we want our children measured against standards or against each other on a bell-curve? Bell curves are zero-sum -- ones' success is another's failure. That's where we've been. Is that where we want to stay? Or would we prefer accepting the ""unstandardized,"" subjective judgements of educational professionals? --That's the dilemma and the reality. Alfie avoids both."
1,Looks like a 1st grader made this!,"I just received this item and was so disappointed. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother, there is no way I would ever give this as a gift. The design in the image is pretty, however the one I got looks like the design was made by a sharpie then filled in. Who ever ""hand painted"" this went out of the lines in every area. Its doesn't look rustic, just sloppy. There are blemishes in the ceramic in the center of the plate and the worst part of all is that there is a finger print on the outer edge of the design. I really hope that this company will resolve this issue in a timely manner."
5,Beautiful Platter,"This is a beautiful platter, pretty enough to use as a wall hanging. It is big and a joy to just look at. It will be great to use as a food serving platter. I'm sure glad I ordered it."
1,Too obvious,"My 12 year old brother, so we found, was unplugging this everytime he used the computer and plugged it back in afterwards leaving everything unchange and not recording anything. Entirely too obvious, and now that we have a usb keyboard it doesn't do anything at all.Dont waste your money on obsolete and inferior garbage like this."
2,Misleading cover,"I borrowed the DVD based on the reviews here. I think it's overrated. It had promise at the beginning but begins to fizzle out in the middle. The main character had flashbacks which is not explained why. Disabled children resistance fighters? C'mon. Let's get real. When did that happen? Evidently this is fiction. Even then I thought this would be a film similar to WWII horror comics, e.g. ""Spear of Destiny, etc."" because of the skeleton-faced Germans on the cover. If you really want to see a good WWII indie film you'd be better of with ""When Trumpets Fade"" and ""Saints and Soldiers."" ""Combat!"" television series in the 60's was way better. This was a waste of my time and money."
1,Straight into Darkness (DVD),This is not a review...I am just trying to tell you that this DVD does NOT have English subtitles as advertised by you!! I am stuck with this DVD as it would cost almost as much returning as buying another!!
1,one star is too much,"this film was bad on many levels. this is a low budget film. Most of this film is filled with bright shining flashbacks to the soldiers girlfriends. they do it so much its annoying. the acting was very poor, the script may have been written by a ten year old. the super soldiers in this film are children. the super soldiers are not effective soldiers and die easily. The Nazis in this film wear green overcoats and in the next scene wear brown coats. The weapons in this film are obvious fakes. the colt 1911 in most of this film looks like a bb gun. the luger has no moving toggle and clicks many times when empty. The tank in this film, supposed to be a Tiger is an obvious fake. Somehow the tank commander is in command of all the Nazis in this film. The editor of this film seems to be a novice. the opening scene a jeep explodes and it takes far too long."
2,Different,"In light of all the books I've read and movies I've seen on the many heroes and common foot soldiers (also heroes in my eyes) of WWII, seeing the movie start out with a couple of American deserters, (one of them 82 Airborne!) immediately put me into a bad state of mind. The movie definitely has a European directed feel to it with a lot of heady, trippy flashback stuff going on to try and show us what was zipping through the depressed mind of the Airborne guy and his American GI ""captor."" There's also the interaction with civilian children and two adults banded together against the Germans. It all comes down to a weak last stand against the Germans only really seeking a loot of fine art in the basement of the building the Americans and civilians are all holed up in.Some people may like the feel of the movie (those who know very little of what happened in the ETO) but I personally wouldn't watch the movie again.Dark and uninspiring and bit strange."
2,Waste of $,"This heater blew a fuse twice in my office, causing my coworkers' computers to shut down and lose unsaved information. The darn thing comes on for 2 seconds every 5 minutes so I'm constantly cold. I would recommend one where you can change the fan setting to go at all times on low without the thermostat stepping in and ruining a good warmth. Also, doesn't turn off unless you unplug it so I have to crawl under my desk everytime I leave the office. No fun. Want to return but it's too much of a hassle."
1,No Safety Devices....No on/off switch,"While this little heater creates heat it isnt what I wanted at all. First of all I realized that it has no safety features. If it tips over unto the rug, it just keeps going! A real fire hazard. Also also the front heat control knob says ""off"" you cant really turn it off without pulling the plug out of the wall, rather inconvenient. And as one of the reviewers mentioned its a real drain on a circuit, throwing the circuit breaker in the first day of use. Last year I bought a Pelonis for less and it was far better."
1,Don't waste your time with this one!,"Honeywell HZ-315 Ceramic HeaterGreetings to whom it may concern. I purchased two of these HZ-315 ceramic heaters on January 28, 2009. Both vibrated across a smooth hard floor surface, very unsafe behavior for an electrical heating appliance. It was too costly to ship back even though they said they'd waive the return fee at customer service. Heater #1 failed on March 20th, didn't even last 2 months. I would advise to steer clear of this model, it's not the quality product you'd expect from a company like Honeywell and doesn't appear to be built to last either. The company I bought it from was very professional and timely, I did not contact them for a replacement. I wouldn't have wanted it anyway."
1,Piece of junk,"I ordered two of these when they were $15.00 each. Wish I would have read the reviews first. Both spend more time off than on, even with the thermostat all the way up. As said, no on and off switch and not much heat. I returned both."
2,Songbook?,"I would call this less a songbook, and more a very self-indulgent auto-biography of Feinstein. May I return it?"
5,Offers several points of view,"This is not a book of one historian's view on past events, it is a collection of mostly firsthand accounts written by people who were experiencing the event at the time. The editors write a brief introduction to each chapter to fit it into the ""big picture"" and then allows the writer to tell his/her story. This approach was a much better way to hold my interest than it would have been to read one person droning on and on in the same writing style from front cover to back cover. The material stays fresh and interesting, and the firsthand accounts of events as they happened really hit home."
4,Try not to be critical,"This is a book that you have to truly read only for content. In that I mean that the language that permeates this book is disjointed, and the events that are chronicled seem to appear from nowhere and then disappear again. In short, it is written in a very 'stream of consciousness' way.With this being said, if you can get past the disjointed form, it is a brilliant work of literature that gives more than a glance at the world of the autistic. Throughout this book, you take a ride through the world of an autistic from her first memories until the present day. This book does not pull any punches, and through years of therapy, she is able to analyze herself and her many actions through the years to make this an easy and gripping read for both the psychologist and the uninitiated."
3,Nobody Nowhere: The Extraordinary Autobiograph,"Although informative, I found this book incredibly depressing and found other books much more hopeful of the possibility of a happy life for my child. I would not consider this book to be a good first read for a family just diagnosed."
4,Old Christmas,"I suppose the book is not for everyone, but if you have an interest/soft spot for old English Christmas traditions & tales, it's a very nice read. I found the reflection of such a joyous time of year in much simpler times a truly intoxicating distraction from every day life (isn't that what reading for pleasure is intended to do?)."
4,"Quiet, pleasant reading of an Old English Christmas","Very enjoyable reading for those who like to pull up a chair, have a cup of tea, and escape to a simpler, more elegant time. Those who enjoy Christmas stories, or Anglophiles who can never get enough of English history will enjoy this insight into an Old English Christmas from one who was there."
4,Quaint writing,"This was a quick, easy read; a nice collective piece.I can't remember if I had evern read Washington Irving. Enjoyable for something free and unusual."
2,Entertaining but flawed,Packed with some great stories. Be better if they were true. He explains little. Ben Franklin invented the harmonica. He doesn't explain it is not the mouth organ but an instriment that didn't catch on. The largest prime number is... He gets it wrong in the title but gets it right in the body of the story. The Tower of Brahma. A legend used to sell a toy (Tower of Hanoi) that Ripley beleived as a fact. Cute. Never corrected in the reprintings and never re-released in paperback because of the massive numbers of corrections needed.
5,Awesome,"Does exactly what it says it does. Quick shipping. If you have a Pioneeer stereo in your car and ANY mp3 player, this is the best way to have it hooked up. You'll have to have your instruction manual to your Pioneer stereo so you can turn your auxilliary input on, but once you do it sounds great."
1,not compatable with all IP-bus radios!,"be careful! i ordered this, only to find that none of the adaptors (pioneer or other) will work on the F-Series! i cant say how this would work, but theres no way to get it to work on my headunit :("
2,You get what you pay for,"Cables arrived on time, easy to get out of the packaging, and self-explanatory to hook up. The first couple of games I tried, things looked and sounded great, but with some games that were downloaded (original Super Mario Bros, for example), half my screen is black and green vertical stripes. I have tried someone else's set of cables and am not having this issue. I've also tried going back to standard red, yellow, white, and am not having this issue, either. The plugs are not very snug - they're pretty loose, and I had to actually hold them in place while I moved the rest of this cable behind the TV. For the games I play most often, I'm getting quality picture and sound - a good deal for what I paid for this. But, I am disappointed in some games being not playable at all, as well as the loose fitting connection. I would not repurchase this set of cables."
3,Not sure it make a difference vs. standard Nintendo RCA cable,"I bought this component video cable for my kids' Nintento Wii to hopefully get a better picture on our new LED 55"" TV. Once I installed the new cable (replacing the standard RCA cable that comes with the Wii), and switched the TV over to the component video source, I couldn't tell the difference in video quality. I must admit I was disappointed, but at least the cables were very cheap. They are a fair bit shorter than the very long cable that comes with the Wii. On the positive side, the cable shipped and was received very quickly."
4,happy with it,"I'm quite happy with the purchase. Color is better in progressive scan mode, and less blurry. It's almost like the framerate is better, even though that it's analog and it has nothing to do with framerate. Also with component cables you can load games in PAL video mode, if you're the kind of person who would ever need to do that. I tried it, it works."
2,you get what you pay for,"What can else can I say. This cable had a lot of lines in the screen and it started flashing after a couple of hours of use. The same Wii and LCD work just fine with another component cable I bought. Great seller, cheap cable."
1,"Big screen, save your $$","Honestly, the picture looks better using the default composite cables. Let your HDTV scaler do the work. All these cable do is makes everything sharper.. and that includes all the jaggies. I'm going back to the composite cables."
3,mediocre..,Improved the quality of the output but the picture would got out and turn my screen blue which was a real pain in the a%$. Just gonna buy the original instead.
1,Wii does not recognize this cables as component. HD mode is unavailable and the picture is in green and white.,"The Wii does not recognize this cable as component. If you bought these to get high-definition 480p video out of your Nintendo, these will make your games look like an old silent film instead. The Nintendo will not allow me to change the definition from 480i to 480p, it is silent and the picture is green and white. I've checked the cable for a switch to perhaps change it from standard to HD, but there is no such switch.I've connected the cables properly into the back of my HDTV and likewise into the back of the nintendo, but I cannot adjust the settings in the Wii menus to display in 480p. The cables are bunk and not worth your money. I am returning them right away and getting component cables that actually work."
3,Doesn't make enough difference,"I bought this cables mainly to get to the $25 minimum for free super saver shipping, and also because long ago I wanted my Wii to look better so I took the opportunity. They are good-quality cables so I have no objection about it being a bad product, but I haven't noticed any difference between the image displayed with this and the standard cables in a 42' LCD. If you want your Wii to look better, it probably won't; it's basically the same thing. There could be an improvement but it's unnoticeable to the human eye. I have seen, though, that in a 32' TV it looked way better and sharper as the blurry image that displays in bigger tvs. I'm not quite sure of this because it was long ago, though."
1,Out of Stock,I ordered this item and they cancelled my order because they did not have enough stock to fufill it. I wonder why they allowed me to order when they didn't have the inventory to fufill this. I'm not very happy with this company and will most likely not order from them again.
2,There's a reason it's only $5.60,"I bought this cable because I lost the Nintendo component cable for my Wii when I moved. Not wanting to spend up to $30 on the product, I found these on Amazon. They do not work as well as the 1st party cables. Every time I turn on the Wii, the entire bottom half of the screen in fuzzy and the screen goes black every 15 seconds with a message claiming the resolution of the Wii is not compatible with the television. On the same TV with the same console & settings, this message did not appear previously. The only reason I rate it a 2 and not a 1-star is because I was dumb enough to believe a quality cable for $5.60 existed. Definitely never going 3rd party again!"
2,It is OK.,I have sony LCD 40 inch TV. I read review about component cable and i bought this cable.It is ok. I did not see much diffrence between original composite cable came with WII and this component cable.I change 480P even not much change. Bought in $4 so no much worry about return because return shipping will take more money then product value.
2,Didn't work for me,"I got this product so that my wii would play on my LCD widescreen tv with better resolution. Unfortunately when I plugged it in, the TV would not recognize that a widescreen signal was being passed through the cable and would only display in 4:3 ratio. I tried changing the settings on the wii to no avail. I could change the settings on the TV to force it to display 16:9, but then I lost the resolution of the picture which was the point of the cables in the first place. When I used the orginal cable that comes with the Wii, the tv recognizes the widescreen settings just fine. Oh well, it was worth a shot."
2,noise on the cable,"cheap cable that induce noise to the signal. I expected good image from a digital cable, but this create more noise than the analog I have."
2,Not really worth it,I didn't really see too much difference with these hd cables. There was a little difference and I guess for the price its well worth it. Just dont get your hopes up when ordering these
1,Stopped working correctly after a month,"These wires worked fine for a month then went bad. I started to get annoying colored lines filling the TV screen. Switched back to the standard A/V cables and all was fine. Wouldn't you know these cables stop working two days after my window to return them. I guess you get what you pay for. Just know with something this cheap you're in a crap-shoot to get a good set, a bad set, or good ones that go bad."
4,"Exactly what the Dr. ordered -- no more, no less","After reading all the reviews from people that complained that the cables were either worse than the stock cables, too flimsy, added additional noise, I wasn't sure what I'd get, but for the price (under $5 with shipping) I was willing to take a gamble.I have to say I'm very pleasantly surprised... the cables look at least as well made as the stock Wii cable and are working perfectly without adding any audio/video artifacts. They're not super-shielded like some other expensive name brands, but are at least as solid as the stock Wii cable, and work perfectly. No fancy packaging, but exactly what I wanted / needed."
4,Great for the price,This item arrived on time and just as described. It works just like I hoped it would. Easy to plug into wii and HDTV
1,Just like any other HD cable that doesn't say Nintendo...,"Its a piece of Toadstool. Skip this thing if you want to skip a headache. Worked for a while, then you'll notice the screen flashing... Its the cable saying ""I'm junk!"""
1,Poor image quality,"Hooked this unit up and got severe blurring of images and loss of of image sync. I know the cable was inexpensive but performance was very disappointing, much worse that standard composite video."
5,Just what I needed,Cable works just fine. I plugged it in to the TV then plugged it in to the Wii and it worked!
3,"These cables actually are not premium, but they do work.","I don't know how they can call these cables premium when they are not double shielded. Additionally, the connectors do not fit as snuggly as the Belkin ones I bought. Of course I paid 5 times as much for the premium Belkin cables. The description claims that the product has an ""Ultra thick and flexible PVC jacket"" but again, the jacket is not half as thick as the Belkin's.On the plus side, the connectors do stay plugged in and the picture quality is great despite not being double shielded. This is a cheap upgrade from the cables the Wii comes with and if you have an HDTV you definitely need component cables--the different is much more noticeable."
1,defective,"this the 1st of 3 times I purchased something from bluemall that either was defective or wasnt as pictured. I contacted them and they never responded until a month later when I inquired about when I was going to get my replacement and they said they had sent one, but the post office must have lost it."
4,Yep,"First off the cables seem to work well and not a bad price either. Only problem is that the Wii isn't known for it's graphics. I couldn't really tell a difference between these and the cables that came with the Wii. Maybe right now the games don't keep up with the cables, maybe some games down the road will make better use of them."
1,Ok,"This product works well for games, but the Wii menu looks terrible with it. I guess it's b/c of all the white and grey or something."
2,"Dead video most of the time, really unstable","It works when it works but FREQUENTLY the connector to the Wii needs nudging or a slight twist to get the picture to stay on the screen. Otherwise you either get (1) complete video loss, (2) flickering video, (3) loss of colors or prominence of just one color. This knock-off was terrible. The only positive is that when the video is actually steady it does output 480p, which is the highest current resolution of the Wii."
3,worth a couple bucks,"These cables did not make a noticable difference in pic quality, but for a few buck, why not."
3,good deal,i like it. it works. it does what it promise. it took 2 more days on delivery but it was ok
5,Cheap and effective component cables for the Wii,"Ever since this arrived and was hooked up, the video output for the Wii improved greatly. The Netflix and Hulu Plus apps look better, all of my virtual console and Wii games look better. If your Wii is hooked up to a HDTV, this is a no-brainer, unless you want to wait for the Wii U."
1,Ugh,"This product says ""Nintendo Wii HD Component Cable"" but do not let that trick you into thinking this is the actual NINTENDO brand cable. Silly me for believing that it would be such a low price..I guess you get what you pay for, because this thing is junk. I actually switched to my normal A/V cable after using this for two days. The whole entire Wii froze up and the TV started making a buzzing sound, and the sound persisted until I unplugged the audio outlet for these cables, causing me to suspect the cable itself is the culprit, especially considering it had never done anything similar before! This is quite concerning, considering we have a forty inch flat screen TV, and of course the Wii, that I felt this cable might have the ability to damage.Terrible, do not buy."
5,Just what I needed after lightning strike.,"Lightning hit the building I was in and took out a few electronics. One of them I thought was the Wii. It came on and I heard audio, but I got no video out of the standard composite cable. After reading a few forums, I figured I'd give these a shot to maybe bring the Wii back into service. Sure enough it worked, and these are the cables I use now. If you need some, these will work."
1,You get what you pay for,Purchased this to get a better picture on my big screen. The sound was horrible there must be a short in the right side audio plug (produces static) The picure was not better then the red/white/yellow plug the wii came with and the wii menu was actually worse. It would cost more to return then it cost to begin with so I guess i will just eat it.
1,Washed out video,"using this cable with my 42"" HDTV, the video is totally washed out, anything close to white is saturated, no matter how I adjust the TV. I've used other component sources with this same TV without any such problem. I dunno if this is a wii problem, or a problem with this cable, but we reverted to the OEM composite cable and everything is fine. For the cheap price of this cable, its not worth the shipping to return it :-/caveat emptor"
1,Delivered Item Was Not As Pictured or Described,"My order arrived on time and undamaged -- however, it was returned because of differences in the item pictured. Picture shows gold-plated terminals, but the terminals aren't gold-plated. Picture shows 2 different ""Red"" plug shapes, but all plugs were exactly the same shape.Thanks, Amazon -- for the convenient, hassle-free Return Policy !!"
5,Way better quality!,"Bought this for my Wii obviously, and it makes the graphics so much better than just the RCA jack, I would recommend this to any Wii owner!!"
5,Composite cable for Wii: it works.,"Well, it's a cable. It connects the Wii to the television.The picture is a little better than it was with the original cable, enough that some video content that was too dark to watch is now watchable. There are more shades of dark than there were, so parts of the picture that are in shadow are still visible, where before it was all black.My expectations were modest, the cable meets those expectations perfectly.It is kind of funny that there is a ""Fun"" rating on this product. It isn't fun, and isn't meant to be. The product does what it it meant to do perfectly well, so I give it 5 stars overall, even though I gave it 1 for fun."
3,Excellent Price and they work,"It was a small risk but worth it. They work. The coloring of the cable is a bit off and once I figured out exactly how they should be setup, by trial and error, I saw what I wanted. They feel like quality cable and for the price, there is value."
5,Great Product,"Thanks to this product, I can now play the Wii on my TV. This is a great deal and was a fast delivery. Thanks much!"
3,Get a Wii to HDMI Converter Instead,"There was a slight improvement in picture quality but there was not a really big difference between using this and using the original wii av cables. Oh well it was less than 4 bucks, so had to try it. I won't even bother with returning it.I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone though, keep your money folks. Instead, get theWii to HDMI 720P / 1080P HD Output Upscaling Converter - Supports All Wii Display Modes, HDMI Upscale to 720p or 1080p Output. I cost me $26.76 when I got it but is sooo worth it."
3,good quality but waste of money,1st off i want to say that there is nothing wrong with this product. It does everything it is supposed to and works perfectly. HOWEVER using these with a Nintendo Wii is not going to improve your resolution as the Wii only supports 480p and 480i which means the Wii is destined to look pixely and fuzzy on any HD tv. This is a limitation of the Wii itself however and not these cables. The cables themselves are high quality and long enough to give you plenty of maneuverability running wires in such a way they aren't tight or stretched.
1,Junk! Picture quality worse than Standard Def Wii cable!!,"The title says it all. Save your money. The product arrived with no problems and appeared fine out of the wrapper. Once I got it hooked up to a 32"" Vizio, there was terrible static all over the screen! It was comparable to tuning in a TV station with an old fashioned antenna. I unhooked it in disgust and will stick with the clear picture from the standard definition cables that came with the Wii!"
1,Do not buy,Connection to the TV is too tight so when you plug it in or pull it out you would have to use a lot of force on each port and that could eventually wreck the component ports.Connection to the Wii is horrible. Constantly loses connection and color fades every few seconds.Do not waste your money.
5,5-stars are not enough.,"I have never been as satisfied, or as pleased,as I am and have been over the Nintendo cable I purchased a few weeks ago. I ordered it on a Friday, rec'd it in the mail on the following Tues. and have used virtually every day since. As I said in the title of this review,5-STARS ARE NOT ENOUGHT!!!!!"
1,Unhappy,"I am very upset with the seller for this product. I placed an order on March 5th for Nintendo Wii HD component Cableby Vista @ $2.19 plus $2.98 S&H; and I get an email today March 7th stating:Dear C ****** Mendozadue to the high demand of item you ordered, we cannot fulfill your item(s) at this moment; we are terribly sorry to inform you that we are going to cancel this order, and the payment money will be refunded in 3-5 business days.sincerely apologize for this inconvenienceIf you have any further questions please feel free to contact me viaemail or by phone @ (626)593-5001 M-F 9am-5pm PSTAmazon Bargaincell Customer ServiceThis is bull**** now the product is offered by the same company for more money! $4.90 I think this is ridiculous! I already told my kids I ordered this for them! Very frustrated poor customer service!"
4,They're cables...LOL...how much to expect...,"I haven't had the opportunity to use them just yet. I sent them to my house in the Dominican Republic. But, how bad can a set of wires be...LOL..."
3,OK for the price but I was not wowed,"Bought these because they were a good price. Shipping was reasonable though ironic that it was 3 times the price of the cables itself. I'd say that there is about a 10% improvement over the cables that came with the Wii, but noting to get too excited about. I might buy the Wii-Licenced Component Cables just to see if they make a real difference."
3,Excellent Overview of Nuclear Arsenals a Bit Dated Now,"When I first read this book in 1985, I was quite impressed by its breadth of knowledge and attention to detail. The author gives an in-depth look at the nuclear arsenals of the major powers - the U.S., U.S.S.R, United Kingdom, France, and China - and their composition - bombers, ICBMs, submarines, etc. There are sections on nuclear proliferation, likely scenarios that might spark a nuclear conflaguration (even then, Kashmir was seen as a likely trouble spot!), and the effects of new nuclear weapons, such as neutron bombs. Excellent graphics and maps. Readers of military history would enjoy this book, although it is the kind of work that can keep you up a night pondering the fate of the world. An update would be useful, with the changes caused by the SALT treaties between the U.S. and the former U.S.S.R and the entry of India and Pakistan into the nuclear club."
4,Japan Does It Again!,"Well, first let's get my bias out into the open. The two best tracks on this Japan CD are ""Gentlemen Take Polaroids"" and ""Taking Islands In Africa"", although neither compares to my favorite Japan track of all time, ""In Vogue"" from the ""Quiet Life"" CD.The ""Gentlemen Take Polaroids"" CD is more moody New Romanticism from one of the true pioneers of the genre. Mick Karn's fretless bass playing got/gets a lot of press, but Japan's true genius is in David Sylvain's voice and lyrics.Any fan of New Wave should own this album."
5,Japan At Their Best,"This is a group in full swing, not only exploring new directions but really showing their well developed skills as individuals but their ability as a group. Swing here typifies their power. Burning Bridges the next track goes in a totally different direction as the mood completely changes, their use of synths here to introduce the song you know something good will follow; one of the moodiest sax solos. My New Career follows what a great song. A very strong album. Very well done."
4,Methods of Romance,"With a sleek, sultry sound cleverly derived from the early Roxy Music, though here even more simmering, Japan reached a creative peak with Gentlemen Take Polaroids. Its affect is almost siren-like, beckoning the listener to descend into whirlpools of serpentine fretless bass, dreamy, evocative synthesizers, and thumping ethnic-influenced drums (both acoustic and electronic). Throw in a penchant for oriental scales, de rigeur vocal histrionics, general arty pretentiousness, and superior production values, and you've got one of the most potent mixtures ever concocted during the post-punk era, albeit with questionable taste in make-up and men's fashions. The highlights are the title track, ""Taking Islands in Africa,"" ""Methods of Dance,"" and the chic, angst-ridden New Romantic ballad ""Nightporter."""
1,THEY SHOOT WRITERS DON'T THEY?,"The film starts in 1978, In NYC the numbers racket is going out of business because the state is starting a lottery. Down on his luck, numbers runner Clyde Coltrane (Glenn Plummer) gets a call from LA. His friend Roscoe (Anthony Johnson) is in trouble. Clyde joins Roscoe who owns a restaurant and the mafia some money. Clyde plans to make the restaurant profitable and bail out Roscoe, however the only thing they have is chicken and flour.The humor is worse than juvenile. For instance a blind black man is given the name ""Eyeballs"" (Kristian Bernard). He believes he is an Italian. Another barrel of laughs is a customer in the restaurant who stutters. The hired help talk about women as if they are Cheech Marin. I didn't laugh while this comedy was playing. The jokes didn't work. Not even a good spoof of African-American film.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Woman in bra. Sex talk."
2,Good product comes up short,"An otherwise good product that has anapparent quality/engineering flaw.The timers for this product are useless.I have had two of these grills and the timers on each itemfailed on the VERY FIRST USE>the dials were not forced, just inferior quality.Of course, you are not suppliedwith a customer service number to call for repair.Thanks George!"
5,GGR88DK is THEE BEST GRILL OUT THERE!,"This is by FAR, THEE BEST grill on the market!The GGR88DK is difficult to find, however we found one company that actually HAS them in stock, (AAWsales). The also have the correct grill stand for it.Thjis grill is easy to use, easy to store, and it works GREAT! We use our 3-4 times per week.College students should also consider buying one, it's a no-brainer.Happy Grilling!"
3,"Tastes good, but can't say it ""worked""","I tried this product with the fertility cleanse kit. I can say that it tastes very good. The licorice root is probably the reason, so if you like teas flavored that way you will enjoy drinking this. As for the tea being beneficial, I can't say it was. First, if you research the ingredients the individual ingredients from a legitimate source (e.g. consumer labs or the NIH), you won't find anything to support the claims of what it is supposed to do for the liver. I can't say I feel any different drinking it. But just to drink if you enjoy tea, it is fine."
4,Short Sweet,"I met Adm Stockdale. And this short documentary is like him, very unassuming, no melodrama, just his thoughts on visiting his old prison in Hanoi. Very good. I would also look at Deter Dingler's documentary, Little Dieter Needs to Fly. Only Vietnam era aviator to escape from capture and live."
2,Not my cup of tea.,"I first had this company's tea in Seattle. It is a little shop at the famous open air market, Pike's Place. I highly reccommend their Red Bush and Spice tea. In fact, the Red Bush tea has 50 times the anti oxidants as green tea.The Huckleberry was a bit too fruity for me and the smell is overpowering in my storage cabinet."
4,This one is a hidden pearl!,"The mix of this project is great. Horns are great!! With a few live cuts mixed in for variety, it does not take away from the overall project. Great musicians...great voice."
5,Treated and Released- Joe Esposito,I found this to be a truly wonderful CD.Joe Esposito has a great voice and is a terrific talent. I've been catching his act in Las Vegas where he sings lead for the group Cat Daddy. I can honestly say I don't think I'll ever tire of this CD. Great Mo-Town sound along with a bit of disco. Worth the price for great entertainment.
5,I LOVE these cloths.,I truly love these cloths. I have been using them for quite a few years and they are a wonder. All traces of mascara and makeup are removed with water.Amazing. They are great for travel. I am only afraid of leaving them behind. It would be nice if they came in different colors for that purpose.
5,Cannot live with out this washcloth!,I have been using these washcloths for at least 10 years. I searched all over to find them when the store I originally purchased them from did not carry them any more. They are so gentle on your skin when it is winter and you feel sensitive and dried out from the cold and overheated buildings. And in the summer they dry quickly in humidity. Great for home and travel. They remove make-up and are totally gentle. I was hooked from day one and will keep buying them. I have not found anything as good - not even the disposable make-up remover wipes compare.
1,Nothing Special,"I purchased this washcloth because I was interested in using fewer chemicals to remove my makeup, and this so-called ""wonder cloth"" promised to do just that. First of all, the cloth is very unusual-looking, with long threads in clumps that look kind of furry. Secondly, when using the cloth it has a very strong chemical smell. I'm not sure if there is something the cloth is soaked in, but it does not smell pleasant and made me wary of using it. Finally, it did not remove my eye makeup at all. Not even eyeliner, let alone mascara. Any washcloth will get off blush and powder, which this one did adequately. However, I feel like I wasted my money. It's nothing special, and I won't be using it due to the bad smell."
5,Wonderful!,This product was suggested to me from a cosmetic company owner to use in the morning with just water so as not to dry out my skin...it works great!
4,works like magic,I've used this product for years. It keeps my other wash clothes and towels free from make up and it lasts for years. The cloth is also very useful for travelling. Just be careful not to leave it out for a maid to take by mistake! I highly recommend this cloth for daily use if you wear make up.
3,works well but not on everything,"The cloth is really soft and dries quickly. It remover well eyeshadow, foundations/blush and mascara (I only put a little bit of mascara, so I don't know for heavy user). However, I also use a non-waterproof eyeliner, and it does not remove it, even with soap. Plus, be careful not to rub your face a little bit too hard with it, it removes eyelashes really easily (so, not really convenient to remove eye make up)."
3,Wonder cloth,This cloth is amazing until you wash it a few times and all of a sudden you are washing your face with a big black mold cloth. They are great and do what they say but you have to buy a new one after about a month or so.
5,Wonder Cloth,"I have used this product for over two years. You can take off ALL of your makeup and just rinse the cloth with water and it's clean again. I use it everyday and throw it in the wash once a week. It dries very quickly and is great for travel. They last forever, but after awhile the back would get a little gray. Now, the new cloths are the same on both sides so they look good for months. It's an outstanding product."
1,not effective at all!,"I read about this product in the Kat James book ""The Truth About Beauty"". I have to say I was very disappointed. I am always excited to try products from companies who offer a more eco-friendly alternative, but this product just doesn't cut it. I don't wear heavy makeup, and live in a humid climate so I sweat most of it off by the end of the day anyway. However, the Wonder Cloth did not remove any of my mascara-normal everyday mascara, not waterproof or extended wear and wouldn't even touch lipstick on the days I wore it. I started to break out after about a week of use so to see how effective the cloth cleaned I swiped my face with a witch hazel soaked cotton ball after using it and was appalled to see considerable makeup residue still left on my face. The cloth is VERY slick and therefore doesn't seem to ""grab"" the mascara or makeup residue off the face. Instead it just seems to smear it around. A plain wash cloth without makeup remover did a better job at removing makeup."
5,Wahsburn is the Transpersonal Theorist of record,"Integrated the work of Jung, Neumann and Grof with extensive noteworthy material from diverse fields of investigation. Developed a concise model which accommodates and extends the prior work. Continued the development of a multidimensional view of psychosocial structures and motifs as elaborations of underlying fundamental properties of consciousness. His explication of the structure and development of consciousness is the clearest and most concise that I am aware of, and fits best with my own experimental data. The best roadmap available for those who choose to stray from the herd. Summaries of his Transpersonal perspective and research interests are available."
5,Awesome,"I know some people didn't like this movie because it was not as historically accurate as the older BBC four hour production. I liked it though and the music is amazing as well as sounding period correct. I love this CD, it was a good buy and it got to me really fast!"
5,A High School Student's review,"Whether you are a fan of the movie Pride and Prejudice (2005), or just a lover of classical music, you are sure to enjoy this soundtrack. The music is such that you can feel the emotion of each piece and envision where each number may go in the movie. It has a peaceful country-like tone that is sure to lull you into a calm atmosphere. The instruments range from a lone-piano telling of a beautiful morning, to an orchestra portraying urgence and danger. I personally love this soundtrack enormously, and have it play as my alarm in the mornings. The music is widely known and has been heard on classical radio stations and at the Academy Awards. Overall, I definetly reccommend both the Pride and Prejudice soundtrack and the movie."
3,Trailer Theme?,Does anyone know what piece of music is being used in the most recent American trailer for Pride and Prejudice where they mention Kara's Golden Globe nomination? It's a beautiful piece of music and I think I've heard it before somewhere else.
4,Pride and Prejudice Soundtrack,"Having bought this for my wife because she LOVES the music and watches the movie and British television shows time after time after time, I was expecting to cringe when I heard it, but it is actually a very nice collection of music. It is on the light classical side which is a nice change from time to time from Country, the Blues, Bluegrass or Rock and Roll.It's obviously a well produced piece and if you can Handel a lighter ""Classical"" music before getting Bach to Warren Zevon, Dave Perkins or the Stones, I think you will like this."
5,Absolutely Breath-taking,"The music alone is so fantastic, so full of emotions and completely lyric free. The different melodies and movements speak their own language as well as bring forth a whole range of different emotions. You can't help but picture beautiful landscape while listening to the soundtrack. It moves you and makes you feel as though you have butterflies in your stomach, I think that alone is worth it."
5,Delightful Pleasure for the Soul,"Wow...this CD is simply beautiful. Each piece reveals a bit of history of that time era, along with the events that happen in the movie. Fantastic movie and book, by the way...so naturally the music is just as delightful."
5,Great Cd,"I love this cd, it's very soothing and I can picture the movie through the whole soundtrack."
5,"Lovely, beautiful, relaxing, moving!",Short and sweet - I love the music from this movie - it is lovely background music and it is also perfect to listen to on it's own.
5,Absolutely beautiful!,This music is dreamy. It is so beautiful and well done! We play it at our office and it always makes me feel happy!
5,wonderful soundtrack,"I simply love this soundtrack.It is the most romantic music to the most romantic scene in a touching film.The emotion and sensibility is probable!Dawn, A postcard to Henry Purcell,Liz on top the world, Leaving Netherfield,Darcy's Letter,Your hands are cold and Mrs.Darcy are my favorite songs!Beautiful moving inspiring beautiful classical music performed by an excellent pianist.I love this music.It's really reflects the feelings in the movie, which by the way is my favorite movie ,performed by my favorite actor Matthew Macfadyen."
4,Classically Beautiful!!!,"When I first heard ""Pride and Prejudice,"" I was amazed by the variety of arrangements it has to offer. From lively folk dances, to soft, quiet piano arrangements. If you like piano music, this is the soundtrack for you! You'll definitely find a little bit of everything in this classically beautiful score!"
4,One of the better motion picture scores,"Diversity. That is what keeps me playing this recording. From the 18th century chamber and lush orchestration of Marianelli's orchestra, this is a beautiful recording.Skillfully engineered, I believe that it is one of the year's best is technical achievement.Enjoy"
4,Love the music - wish there were more,"I absolutely loved the music from the film, and I hardly ever buy soundtracks, but I had to have this one. The music seems too short, not that they cut any of the songs, but they are so good you wish there was more of it. It would have been nice to have all the music of the film on the track - you are just getting the original music made specifically for this film. The authentic music of the time (such as Mr. Belvedere's Maggot), most of what they dance to in the movie, are not included."
5,perfect music for a perfect flim,"I simply adored the film and the soundtrack fits the film perfectly. I am finding myself listening to it over and over. You can just visualize the best scenes...especially ""Your Hands are Cold"". You can feel and see Darcy emerging from the morning mist and walking towards Lizzie where he proceeds to pour his heart out to her. It is the most romantic music to the most romantic scene in a film in many years. The emotion is palpable! Buy this CD and see the movie again. Just simply the best!"
4,Music to my ears.....,"This soundtrack is a great listen for anyone who loved the movie. I thought it was great how they named the pieces after the scenes that their in. You can re-watch the movie in your mind with the music to go with it. Not being much of a classical buff, I do enjoy the elegance of it and I loved how it was light and soulful at once, feeling the deepness that the characters must have felt. I especially love track 15, Your Hands Are Cold. You can practically see Mr. Darcy walking towards Elizabeth in the dawn light. You want to hear him say how much he loves Elizabeth and how she ""bewitches him body and soul"". Defenitely a great purchase for anyone who is a true romantic."
5,She Loves It!!!!!!,I Bought This For my Wife. She listens to it Every Day First night she went to sleep withit playing
5,Love this!!,"I listen to it, and remeber the exact point in the movie I heard it. And the music is so beautiful."
3,Not in order,"Of course, the music itself is just wonderful! Love the movie and the music. The reason I only gave it 3 stars was the order of music selection does not match the order on the dvd.( I considered leaving only a 2 star review!) I deal with sleeping problems including insomnia. I often sleep with the movie on so my mind is occupied. I bought this cd so to just enjoy the music without having to have the bright light of the tv on all night. It took me awhile to adjust to having the order not match. I couldn't picture the movie scenes in my head with the cd. So it has been a disappointment."
5,Music from Pride and Prejudice.,"The music from Pride and Prejudice is simply ""Beautiful"". I also bought the piano music for a family member as a birthday present."
3,"Wonderful fim, music works","I love this version of the story. Its been filmed so many times but I think this must be the best. The lead characters are especially involving. The music is fine even though much of it was ""borrowed"" from classical music. There are some verytouching moments in this movie and the music adds to the atmosphere. Its just not the most original soundtracks I have heard. Despite that its worth hearing."
5,Great soundtrack,"Jean-Yves Thibaudet and Dario Marianelli never dissapoint, I happened to enjoy the soundtrack as much as I enjoyed the film. Among the tracks, the one I found more enticing was ""Your Hands are Cold"", pure piano delight."
5,Perfect Reading Music,"I have always struggled to find music that I can listen to when I read. This cd is perfect to read to. The music you hear in the trailers is not on this cd. Make sure you pick up a copy of the soundtrack, ""Love Actually"" to obtain ""PM's Love Theme"" and then grab Howie Day's cd with ""Collide"". Music from ""Sense & Sensibility"" is also in the trailers (A Particular Sum & Willoughby). Also, Franz Schubert's piece ""German Dance No. 1 in C major"" (Barry Lyndon soundtrack) can be found in the trailers."
4,FANTASTIC! I WILL BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!,"It was exactly as indicated, it said it was sealed and it was, said it was in good condition, it was in great condition! I will definitely buy from this seller again!!"
3,Dull,"It took me more than 2 weeks to finish this book. The story is excruciatingly slow-paced for the first three fourths of the novel, and only starts to capture the reader's interest in the last quarter or so. There, the author finally starts accelerating the pace, throwing in some interesting twists. The plot is tied up neatly and the explanation is satisfying, but by the time that happens you really don't care anymore."
2,Good sound but the USB connection does not work.,"I am satisfied with the sound of this small voice recorder. However, I cannot install the Voice Studio software onto my computer. I noticed the problem at Circuitcity.com, and thought that was associated with Windows 98. However, I am using Windows ME. I have not had any problems with any other software. Therefore, be aware that this recorder may not work on your computer as well. I am giving a two star rating because 1) the claimed selling point is not working. 2) Panasonic has terrible customer service with this product. No support information on this product on their website. No response to e-mail inquiries. Called them, I was put to wait for 40 minutes and then kicked out. Their customer service let me feel angry."
2,Recorder OK but can't share the sound files,"This is a versatile recorder but it is NOT recommended to anyone that wants to send their recordings to other people or even keep their recordings for the future. The recordings can only be read and edited using a Panasonic software (Voice Studio) which is incompatible with anything else. If you want to save your recordings in mp3, first you have to save to .wav using the proprietary software, then transform wav to mp3 using another software. On top of that, if (as it happened to me) you lose or damage the CD with the Voice Studio installer, there is NO way to get a copy from Panasonic or anyone else. It is absolutely mind-boggling why Panasonic would not offer this software for free, as you cannot use it unless one buys the recorder first.Bottom line: if you want to keep your recordings in a computer, make sure you buy a recorder that records directly in a known format (preferably mp3). Do not buy this product."
2,"Does the job, but cheap",I thought this would be bigger and better made. What appeared to be metal in the picture is just some cheap plastic with flimsy switches.
1,no software support or driver downloads on site.,"Product works OK for the price.Problem is that I lost the software and after a computer crash I am unable to download the info. PANASONIC HAS NO DRIVERS FOR THIS PRODUCT ANYWHERE ON THEIR SITE - PERIOD. Many other people have complained about this as well on various sites, I found all of them because I searched so much for the drivers."
2,"it's nice, but not great...especially for the price","The microphone is too sensitive...I use this recorder to get class lectures, but so much background noise (and conversations) are picked up I can hardly hear the lecture. The software for the program is great, as long as you only want to use their sound file format. You can convert to .wav, but the sound quality it dramatically reduced (and background noise amplified). It's also impossible to share your sound files with another person...or it might be, but I've been unable to find a way to save the recordings to cd. If you plan to use this for minimal use in a disciplined environment, than this might be the one for you. Otherwise you might want to shop around some more."
1,Beware - Panasonic is Unprepared to Provide Support,"I bought the RR-US360 one year ago for my son to use at college to record and download class lectures. When a hard drive crash required that I reload drivers, I found out the hard way that this product class is not one Panasonic takes seriously. Driver link on website leads to dead end. Three calls and multiple transfers to tech support lead to dead ends and total frustration. I had to multiple time explain the concept of a USB driver. My recommendation is to find a company serious about their product.(...)"
2,Panasonic not suitable for professional dictation.,"This recorder has high quality sound but the features do not make this suitable for professional dictation. In particular, it is not possible to rewind a dictation to make corrections, and once the stop button is depressed, there is no possibility of further editing. For these reasons the Olympus DS-330 is a better buy."
2,The Propriatory Audio Format is BS,"That's really all that needs to be said. I bought it assuming it recorded in MP3 format, like most recorders do these days. I bought it specifically for recording ambient samples to be used in my music. Because there is no way to convert it to mp3, and Panasonic refuses to write software that allows that conversion, the product is entirely useless to me.However, if you just use it for class notes or something and don't mind the crappy software that does come with the recorder, you'll be fine."
2,Great recorder - horrible computer interface - no customer support,"I really like my Panasonic Digital Voice Record, as far as recording and playback go. I've been using it for years. However, the proprietary file format means that you have to use the software that comes with the device, which is not compatible with Windows Vista. Since my old computer died and my new one has Vista, I no longer can transfer the files to my computer. Panasonic provides terrible support. According to their technical support on the website, the device is not compatible with Vista, and they have no plans to make it compatible. Also, they don't have the interface software available on the support page, so if you lose it, you're out of luck.Unfortunately, I'd be very hesitant to buy another electronic device like this from Panasonic again due to their lack of support."
1,DON'T BUY- PANASONIC WILL NOT UPDATE TO WORK W/ VISTA,"Hi, I've had this for a year. My computers crashed, and the ""Voice Studio"" software made by Panasonic, is not compatible with Windows Vista. I contacted Panasonic, as they did software updates for some of their recorders to work with the most popular operating system, Windows Vista. They sent me an email they are not going to make this recorder compatible with Windows Vista. Therefore this recorder gets one star, for not being supported, since it is only a year old. You can not download the recordings without using their software. Other recorders by other brands may let you connect by USB, and you do not have to use their software to download and access your recordings. I'll be dumping this on eBay, and getting a Sony or something else, my last Olympus had an echo when I recorded. I bought this for the long recording times, up to 18 hours. Do not buy."
4,"little recorder, lots of fun","Fairly easy to use, comes with soft ware that I found uncomprehensible. If it would type for you it may be useful. The kids totally love it, recording funny stuff. Comes in handy for writting on the road, and recording lectures."
5,A+,"I cannot say enough about this and all the other math DVD's this company offers. No matter how much I read and studied my textbook, I was still having trouble with calculus so I desperately bought the video to see if it would help. What I realized is that I needed to be able to see the process over and over until I felt I really understood it. With a video, it is easy to replay the segment as many times as you need. Often, taking a derivative is not even the real problem; rather it is simplifying the answer down to the final form that I needed more help with and this DVD really helped with that. Jason offers numerous samples from the various ways that you need to take a derivative so that you can easily see the process and apply it to your own homework. I also ordered the higher level DVD's to get through Calc II. Honestly, I did not get an A, but I don't think I would have passed without the additional help these DVD's provided."
1,Waste of good paper,"An instructor actually chose this text for a class. I know the choices were limited because this is a rather obscure subject, but there has to be something better than this! I have never seen a textbook biased until reading this one. This guy is clearly anti-union and is hung up on ""Godfather""-type transactions. This book is absolutely worthless."
4,Interesting Read,"I'm using this book in a class that I'm taking and I find most of the information current, up to date and interesting. I enjoy reading it because of some of the topics that are in it...I have lived some of the experiences that the author has written about and it lends credence to what is in it..."
4,...[some people] will hate this book,"how fascinating to read the different reviews of this book!it seems that the ""child advocates"" who are out to ""protect"" kids are all giving this one star. well, its sad and silly but that is what they are.this is a story about a man who loves a young boy and is able to show it in all possible ways. i am not saying that every man-boy relationship should be sexual, and im not saying that there are not plenty of adults who are out to sexually exploit a young boy. but this story is certainly NOT a portrait of that. why cant these people acknowledge that its as possible for a boy and a man to be attracted to each other as it is for two adults (and i think its safe to say the critics would only deem male-female permissible) to care?as to the book itself, it tends to be a bit stilted at times; i would have given it only three stars, but i am giving geraci an extra star for his bravery in putting this caring -- and necessary -- work on paper."
1,Unbelievable- foul book,"The fact that this book tries to make a predatory relationship respectable is despicable. In brief, it's a story of a perverted adult male who seduces an emotionally needy boy. Anyone who thinks this book is great is suspect. Don't forget- molesting is illegal. If I could have given this book a 0 star, I gladly would have done so. Anyone who can condone behavior that clearly destroys children's lives is off."
1,I just didn't get it,I just didn't understand this book. It just didn't make sense. It wasn't reality based and just isn't relevant. I am really disappointed with the overall story and writing style. I wouldn't recommend it to others. Sorry.
4,A tasty treat,"My 6-year-old daughter is allergic to every artificial food color. That makes it difficult to find tasty treats for her. These have a wonderful natural strawberry flavor. They are not super sweet, just right. The reason that I had to give them 4 stars was for the texture. They are a bit hard. Mind you, it did not keep us from eating all of them. Maybe actually it is a good thing because it made us take longer to eat them! I am actually coming back now to try the raspberry vines."
2,Nothing like twizzlers,"I was kinda disapointed when I ate these gluten-free vines. They taste kinda blan. They have a plastic taste, they could have more flavor and a little more sugar. The texture wasn't bad. They are okay, but I won't buy them again."
5,A Group Named Audience,"Audience was a terrific band from the end of the sixties genre (early seventies). House on the Hill and Lunch are some of the greatest albums from this period. Audience was somewhat like Jethro Tull, but very unique in their sound. Both albums contain great music and lyrics. Your Not Smiling, Indian Summer, Nancy, on Hill and Stand By the Door, Ain't the Man You Need, Trombone Gulch and Buy Me an Island, on Lunch. Also on Lunch the song, In Accord, is a great-intertwined tale of love and music.If you like classic rock music then this album is worth buying. I agree that It Brings a Tear should have remained. Also the vinyl song order was there for a reason (Gus Dudgeon, Producer).It is nice to read the other reviewers comments and to know that I was not alone in my enjoyment of Audience's music. I wish someone would / could build a web site on Audience like they have done for Wishbone Ash. Does anyone from the Elektra Records label know what happen to the band's members?"
5,Must be played LOUD,"The best of Audience. A timeless classic full of energy. The vocals are raw, and untamed. The melodies grab you by the throat. The title song has a haunting quality that has never been imitated. Jackdaw is worth the price of the CD."
5,bound to benefit from CD format clarity,"After reading the glowing reviews on Amazon I reconnected my usually idle turntable and had a listen to my original USA manufactured LP (Elektra EKS-74100). I was immediately reminded of how wonderful this album is, but also of why I hadn't listened to it in maybe 20 years - what looks like pristine vinyl is literally laden with pops and clicks. So I happily bought the CD, which sounds much clearer and more powerful, and allows me to melt into the recording.""The House On The Hill"" is one the great living testaments to the art and skill of the late great producer Gus Dudgeon."
5,Still going strong?,"I have been a fan of this band since I discovered them in the 70's. They were so ahead of their time with the inclusion of flute, sax, along with the strong bass and amazing vocals and their sound has stood the test of time, as well as this album.It is because of Trevor Williams that I became a huge fan of the bass guitar and Axl Rose's unique vocals weren't unique at all - Howard Worth is the originator!I have always pined after their albums and wished more would miraculously appear and I may just get my wish! They are back! In the autumn of 2004 they began playing gigs in the UK. Let's hope that North America isn't far off!Check out their site at www.audienceareback.com and keep checking for more music to come!"
5,Classic at it's best.,I have had this Album/CD since 1972. the Year I graduated from high school. It's still one of my favorites of all time
5,A MUST HAVE...,"If I was going to be isolated on an island and could have only 10 albums to listen to for the rest of my life, without question, this would be one of them. My personal memories of this music are too precious to share, but if you have never heard this album, you must find it and listen to it as soon as you possibly can. This is music to rival the greatest ever made. Serious."
5,"I fully agree, release this CD now.","I was sorry to see that the samples were from side one, when it was French garden and Wise man in your heart, that took me then."
1,Yuck!,"I'll be honest, after the other three reviews, I thought I would give it a try and thank goodness I only rented it. To be honest, I totally regret it and in fact, I think they should have either added this directly to Amazon Prime or paid me to watch it for wasting my time. I've never had anything bad to say about anything before, but the acting sucked, the backgrounds were fake (the skull backgrounds were pretty, even though you can easily tell the actors were superimposed on them), the sound effects sucked, the plot was horrid and the makeup was terrible. I don't think this movie even deserves be called a ""B"" movie. It also stole a lot of lines (""Don't bring a knife to a gunfight,"" ""I'll be back,"" etc.) and plot from a lot of other movies (like From Dusk to Dawn, the Howling, Vampires, Blade, etc.). Unless you are a glutton for punishment or you need a good laugh, don't even bother with this until it goes to Prime."
2,Would not recomment at this price,The cover art was the best thing about this movie. Had I bought this for around $5 I would not have been as disappointed as I was. I guess I was expecting more for the price I paid.
2,westwing the complete series,"Wow, what a joy it was to actually get my hands on this wonderful series.It is everything I thought it would be, except that after season four, English subtitles are no more. Being a hearing impaired person, I was very very disappointed to find this out. The booklet never said...interestly the Individual box sets have English sub titles...So, If you're hearing impaired or deaf, buy the box set individually....it is a good series thought..."
5,Great buy!,"West Wing is one of the best shows ever produced and is as relevant today as it was a decade ago! This package is amazing, you have all the seasons together, plus some extra goodies and it looks great. Anyone that likes politics will love this package."
5,Fantastic all episodebox with all the extras,Fantastic boxset with all the 7 seasons of the westwing. The character performances and the scripts are fascinating and all the prizes have been wellearned. I'm proud to say : I have it ALL !
5,Excellent,I bought this as a gift. The recipient really loved it. He said it included great bounus materials. The case that it comes in is very nice and the DVD are nicely organized. Great gift for anyone who is a big West Wing fan.
3,The complete West Wing series,"fast service, One of the CDs does not play at all and we are having trouble with a few of the other cds skipping through chapters."
3,worth the price,"One of the good TV series in the last 20 years, and worth the price to be able to work your way through the series, episode by episode...I only wish that they had continued the series with Jimmy Smits and his Presidency being the premise."
5,One of the Best Purchases I've Ever Made,I absolutely love this show and I will argue until I am blue in the face with anyone who thinks this wasn't one of the best shows ever written. So of course when I saw this box set I had to have it. The box set not only includes every minute of this epic show but looks great on display as well.
5,Fully satisfied,"The product arrived on time, was not a Chinese knock-off, looked great, and plays great. It is exactly what I was expecting and I highly recommend it."
5,Amazing,"I have loved this series since I first saw it on TV a few years back. I am now watching it on Foxtel in Australia with my daughter and just could not resist buying my own copy - it is so well done I don't believe it is not a documentary! If I ever visit the White House, I would expect to see all of the main caracters there:)"
3,quality issue,the series is great but the audio and video are not synched in this set collection and it is distracting
5,Check your set as soon as it arrives,Just received my order one day shipping for a Memorial Day weekend marathon. Opened the package and found season one disk four missing. Called Amazon they are shipping a new set June 1st. Not really Amazon's fault must have been an error at the factory.
5,Best TV Drama Ever,"I received this as a christmas present a few years ago (when it was priced much cheaper!). I love this show and having the beautiful box set is wonderful. That being said, they could have provided better protection for the discs than they did and the current amazon price of $200 is WAY too much when you can watch the reruns on bravo."
4,Doesn't Play on Laptop,"I bought this because I love the show. I was hoping to watch the episodes on my laptop, but note that these DVDs do NOT work on laptops (or at least not mine). I can only view the discs on my regular DVD player.I've never had a problem like this before, so I don't think it is an issue with my computer. I assume this limitation is deliberate and has something to do with the producers making sure the discs can't be copied, but I have found it to be inconvenient."
5,A great series!,"If you're a fan of the show, you'll love the compact presentation of this DVD collection!"
3,MK West Wing,All in all it was good! There were two disc that i had problems with and i intend to get back to the provider to see if that problem can be rectified.
5,Perfect for fanx,"This is a great set and nicely presented for those who are fans. There are nice little extras and the booklet, which is quite informative."
5,The World as we wish it could be!,"Life lessons, civics lessons, problem solving lessons and deeply human through and through. Oh where it so that the the country could aspire to be like this. Take your family, especially teens through this series."
4,Sorkin/Schlamme's Best,"I don't think this show needs any more piling on; it's spectacular. If you haven't seen it, see it.As for this boxed set, I haven't looked at seasons 5-7, but the other disks are all just repackaged versions of those found in the original single season sets, with all of the same special features, menus, etc. I've found the case itself to be a little ill-conceived: the tabs for each season get bent if you turn the box over, cardboard disk slots aren't the best way of holding DVDs, It's physically large and heavy, the booklet is large and a little difficult to fish out from the top of the box. The inclusion of the script from the pilot is a nice, if unsubstantial addition.Bottom line, it's a cheap way of getting all of the DVDs."
5,Best Purchase,"Bought this for my husband's bday. He loved all the series he had seen when on-air; I had never seen any, but loved it from the start when we started viewing this collection. One of the best casts for a series I've seen in a while. The box is a great way to store all the dvds w/easy & convenient filing, that commendably takes very little shelf space. Script, acting, storyline, & the package presentation are all quite well done...& I hate spending money on things that aren't truly a necessity or of very high personal value."
5,Way better than some describe,I noticed some of the reviewers slamming this set. They claim the cardboard inside will eventually destroy the discs. I see no evidence of this being possible. Also noted by some was the lack of subtitles. Subtitles are there for the first four seasons just like my original individual seasons. Should have gotten this a few years ago!
5,President Bartlett should be running today for the job of all jobs!,"I have not opened the collection because I watched the series and loved every minute of it! Too bad his name is not on the ballot as he would WIN in a landslide. This is a gift for a cranky Republican with whom I have been arguing about the 2012campaign! This will enlighten him--he never watched THE WEST WING but I'll just bet that he'll change his vote asap afterwatching what a good President does in office. I'm voting ""more of the same"" but still wish I could be voting for Bartlettand be living in another time which was less stressful. Blessings to us all.........!"
1,Defective product - missing episodes,"First let me say that I adore the West Wing series. I would rate it 5 starts.Aside from the fact that many of the discs would not play correctly on several of our disc players/laptops (we finally bought a new DVD player and that solved THAT problem), the first 3 discs of season 3 were entirely missing! We didn't discover that until after the 90 day return policy. We are on season 7 now, the last season of the series, and when we sat down last night to watch the second disc in that season, it was labeled correctly, but it contains episodes from season 6 that we already saw. I can only hope that the rest of the discs in season 7 are ok. Noticing other reviews about the English subtitles, I will add that the set we got did have English subtitles through season 4 or 5 but then that was no longer an option.I would not do business with Moms Video Store again due to the defective nature of the set of discs that I received."
1,Faulty DVD set,"I purchased this DVD set exactly a month, for my husband, who's a huge West Wing fan. Imagine my disappointment when the DVDs in the fourth season did not play at all and kept skipping. I'm appalled that Amazon would sell such an atrociously faulty product. I want a working replacement for this set and would be looking into requesting one right away."
1,Discs Don'tPlay after 1 Year - MAnufacturing Error. Amazon does not let you return after they stop working!!,"I love this series and bought 2, one for my Dad. After about a year my discs stopped reading!!! Some of his too!! We just about have a whole collection between us. They wear out too late for amazon's return policy. BEWARE!!"
3,Great show but product damage,"This is my favorite show, so I was very excited to order the complete series. But the description said the product was brand new in the original factory packaging. When I got the product, there was some damage to the outer case and to the individual sleeves. This would have been good to put in the review."
2,Awful first experience buying used,"I love the West Wing, and so does my girlfriend. I bought her a ""just because"" gift of the entire collection, and thought that if I could get a ""like new"" version, it would be fine to get it used, since we're both committed to saving money.Bad plan.We're on Season 4, and 2 of the discs so far (that's 10% by the way) are unreadable on several different machines. Seriously disappointing."
3,Well worth the $,"I actually never watched this show on TV but have rented it sporadically. One, the presentation/packaging on this series collection (I have bought others), is a 5 star plus.I'm partly through season 2 and am loving it even though I have seen some of the episodes through rentals before!I purchased this partly due to the past reviews and am so happy I did. Best $180 I have ever spent."
4,The West Wing - Not Very Pleased,"I was pleased with the seller's quick responses to my email inquiries. However, I am only giving 3 stars because the DVD set box was a bit damaged. Although it was wrapped as if it were a new box, the actual box was dented at the corners and torn at the creases as if it had been open and closed multiple times. Luckily, the DVDs inside seemed unused. I was mostly displeased with the wear and tear of the box especially since it was said to be ""new."""
5,"The best! No commercials, no interruptions!","I bought this as a Christmas gift for my father, who considers The West Wing to be the best tv series ever made, couldn't always catch it when it was on the air, and gets frustrated with all the commercials during the reruns. He LOVES these dvd's. He started at the very beginning and every couple of nights looks forward to sitting down and soaking in the next episode. Many hours of enjoyment, no commericals, no interruptions! He says it is the most thoughtful gift he has ever received. It's an especially great gift for someone who liked the series but who already has ""everything."""
2,It skips alot,"Great to have the entire box set without doubt, but I find that (at least in the first season), there are multiple situations where the discs skip. This happens on multiple consoles."
5,If this set ran for President -- it would sweep all 50 States!,"I was a big fan of this series when it was on the air, so it was an absolute no brainer to buy this set upon release. Not only is the content great, but the packaging is amazing as well! Looks great on the shelf, and the cost makes it easy to own all 7 seasons in one purchase rather than having to get each season separately."
4,a step away from prefection,"Cons are stated well by other reviewers, such as condensed script(so unprofessional), unsatisfying packing(glue is a nightmare) and etc. But anyway, it is a wonderful drama collection."
5,West Wing Complete Series,"I finally splurged on myself and bought the complete 7 seasons of West Wing. I thought I'd sit and watch them all at one time, but did not realize how many programs 7 seasons contained! I am in Season 3 and enjoying watching each program. The picture quality is great and I am loving the commentaries."
5,"Brilliant series, Beautiful package.","In the age of reality television, The West Wing was my saving grace for many years. It is surprisingly re-watchable whether you like to jump around to your favorite episodes or watch it again start to finish. After every disc I play I'm ready for another. ""What's next?"" as Jed Bartlet would say.On 45 discs , you just couldn't ask for a better box. The set is well organized, easy to access, and surprisingly small. Any specific episode takes only seconds to find and the extras are great. The pilot script really sums up the quality of the series. If you're a fan and haven't bought a lot of the other seasons already, then this is the way to go."
5,The West Wing,"My wife is a long time fan of THE WEST WING. She absolutely loves this set of DVDs. During the show's 7 year run, she occasionally missed an episode. Now she watches them all at her own pace. The boxed set includes comments by Aaron Sorkin and summaries of each episode."
1,BEWARE,Customers beware DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER I never received this order and have not been compensated
1,Very Confusing,"I received two complete sets (one replacing the other) because the first disk, first show, first series etc., started in the middle of the third season...both original sets sent to me. You could not watch show number 1, season number 1 because the disks were not in any order and to give them to my 84 year mother who loves the show and tell her that they aren't in order but go ahead and enjoy them, was not going to work...so I'm hoping I receive my money back because I have sent both complete sets back."
1,Awful Servce,Never received product more than a month later and no response from service department after email inquiry. Do not purchase anything from Royal Video. And Amazon claims no responsibility even though they list it on their site. What's the point?
5,Excellent Product,"This product was excellent. The price was within my means and the quality was extremely satificatory. I would highly recommend the purchase of this product for all those who loved the series, and especially those who miss it."
1,"Great show, POOR QUALITY OF RECORDING!","I enjoyed the orginal show, the action never lagged, writing always quick-witted. HOWEVER, the recording of these discs (just about every one of them) is of extremely poor quality. These could only have been rejects that should have been destroyed. The poor quality is such a distraction that it severely compromises what should have been many hours of veiwing pleasure. Had I known the discs were so poorly recorded, I would never have ordered them. Such a disappointment!"
5,The West Wing - The Complete Series DVDs,"This item has been reviewed multiple times under other listings for it. I believe that my item is listed separately because it likely has a different ASIN from the others listed. To list this I plugged in what was on the item and a listing for it appeared without a picture on Amazon. Therefore it is what it is, another edition of it that no one else has listed previously. It is superb and contains a lot of bonus material provided by the writers, directors, and producers. There are 45 disks!"
2,west wing,"The packaging and dvd quality are excellent, however, the subtitles are terrible-I had to turn them off and use my TV captions. The subtitles on the discs are abbreviated and often summarize incorrectly the words being spoken-and, after all, the series was wonderful because of the words being spoken. They've done a disservice to the hearing impaired."
3,The box came apart.,"The DVDs are perfect and everything about it is amazing, except by the time I was checking it out the back had become completely unglued. I can see where all the glue is but it isn't attached to the DVD holder anymore."
5,Quite impressive,"This collection is of course complete, and quite impressive. I enjoyed this show a great deal when it was on, and it was wonderful to go back and watch the whole thing, front to back, over again. My wife and I watched every episode; at times we'd watch as many as half a dozen at a sitting. Highly recommended."
4,Great Product,"It came perfectly packaged and in good condition. A little case scratching, but the product works great! I love this show and I couldn't be happier!"
4,All the best Westwing at Once,"The DVDs are not great quality for the first season (4:3) because that was how it was produced but the rest of the 8 seasons are wide screen and look much improved.For the price, if you are a West Wing fan and you want more than 2 seasons this is the way to go.I was impressed with the quality of the box and it closes with a embedded magnet of all things!The extras on the DVDs are the same (or similar) to the ones you get on the season box sets. The big difference is that the DVDs here are single sided (4 shows per disc) while the individual season box sets are double sided. I think that makes this set just look bigger but since the price it better than buying them individually it does not matter. The quality seems the same.+ Good price if you want more than one season+ Good packaging- First season quality is ok (but what do you expect from an old TV show that was filmed 4:3.- The contrast seems a bit washed out at times."
2,great customer service from amazon seller but sub par product,"the seller of this item has been very kind and responsive but the product itself has not lived up to my expectations. the first disc of the collection played without any problems; the second won't play at all, saying 'wrong disc type' after endless minutes waiting to load. and, of course, the third disc played perfectly. i suspect the problem lies with the retailer that this seller bought the collection from -- and i don't think he'll be using that retailer anymore -- but it still stinks to not have a pristine set of discs."
1,poor quality,"Very poor quality-several discs are unwatchable-although this is not a used product. Attempts to contact TopNotch 1 to make an exchange have proven fruitless. Two emails have been sent to them through Amazon, with no response of any kind."
3,"Good, but not new.","Very happy with the price of product and I guess the product itself. All disc are there and work. No scratches. This was to be a NEW item but, that was not the case. The seller re-shrink wrapped the box and saved all the original shipping materials for re-packaging. Seller is a lair. Item is not new. One of the pouches holding disc 2 of season 1 is torn. The Pilot script is missing. Other than the seller being a lair the product was great. I over paid for a used item, but oh well. Sold for $249 is store a year ago."
5,Don't know yet.,"I haven't seen but one episode of this series, when it was on TV. But, I thought I would watch it as training for when I get to be president some day."
1,Product defective and not replaced,Product defective. Dvds would not play in the DVD player or 3 different computers. 3 emails to seller ignored. Product never replaced. Very disappointing.
1,Why would anyone buy the complete series package?,"Ok, there are seven seasons; at the price of $17.99 times 7 comes to $125.93. Why pay over $143 for the complete series set?"
1,west wing,"It was not original factory sealed DVD from US. the package was shipped from China, the pictures on the discs were distoreded, and DVDs didn't work on the laptop, some of them worked on the regular player, can see the scratch marks on most of them. Refund was prompt but the return postage that was promised to be sent via a check was not received to this date. Disappointed since this was very first time ordering on-line."
1,Poor cutomer service,I ordered this box set Dec 13th. I was given a delivery window of Dec 19th to Jan. 7th. As of the 7th I still had not received the order.I emailed Sophies Movies twice and it took 2 days to get a response. They sent me a tracking number and when I checked with the post office they stated the order had been delivered on Dec 23rd. I was diligently checking the mail daily as I was expecting this order but it never arrived. Maybe had I not waited until Jan 7th I may have been able to track it better. Further contact with Sophies Movies has only resulted in emails referring me to the tracking number. Customer service both through Sophies Movies and Amazon have been lacking and disappointing. I will not be using either again.
2,Great series but terrible discs,"The actual series is one of the best to ever be on TV, but about half of the DVDs could not be read by the DVD player or skipped over large sections of the episode despite appearing to be in good condition."
4,"West Wing Delivers, with 1 big letdown","I think that this is a wonderful product. The disks came in perfect packaging and the cases are good. There was although a problem. The episode guide was very nice in finding specific episodes fast and easily.One big letdown was the fact that seasons 1-5 have English, Spanish, and French subtitles, but seasons 6-7 did not. I have trouble hearing some words in the show so until season 6 the subtitles were a lifesaver. I in fact stopped watching the DVD's to watch TV reruns which did have subtitles. I think if you liked the show or want to try a new show (and like politics!) this is the best show to watch.To be honest the pilot scrip was just a big waste of paper. I cannot possibly imagine what you could do with the script in typewriter font.I would buy this again but the subtitle problem was big as was the waste of pilot script. If you are a fan of the show this is one to buy."
4,Like it!,Love the packaging - very creative and a wonderful box set to be given as a gift. Great price!! :)
5,The West Wing,I bought this for a gift. The person who wanted it pointed it out to me. It came in a sturdy folder that looks like a briefcase. The recipient was thrilled to get it.
2,Does not work,I have tried 3 different CDs in 3 different DVD players and they do not work.Everything looked great but they just do not seem to work.Pretty much sucks but I get that's what happens when you buy something off here.
5,Love it!,Love this series. Love the packaging but the older episodes look a bit old and bad on the HD tv. I wish they had it on blu-ray.
1,I would not recommend,"From the moment I opened the box I've the same problems. Programs not responding, Windows shutting down and window changing sizes uncommanded. I have contacted Toshiba several times. I was told that I should have returned the computer to the retailer. However,inside the box ws a note telling me that if I had any problems that I was not to return it but contact Toshiba. I'm sure its a problem with Vista, but Toshiba sold me the computer with this OS. Toshiba now wants me to send my new computer in for servicing. It's like buying a new car with many problems and the dealer wants me to send it back to the factory for repairs. Like the car, I bought the new computer because I needed it. I cant go weeks without a car or computer.I would no recommend Toshiba or VISTA untill they workout all there problems.Walter"
3,Good performance... but...,"The laptop has been performing well for a month and half. However, internet explorer has never worked and has caused many crashes. This is frustrating since I called Toshiba and they told me that they will guide me through a re-installing of everything on the laptop. I don't have time to do this.This is one problem. The other problem is physical. The screen came with a non-working pixel. It stays blue all the time. Toshiba will take the computer away for repair... a complete hassle since I need the computer every day. If the laptop had not arrived with these problems, it would get 5 stars."
2,toshiba satellit a205-4777,"baught this computer 7 months ago and has already crapped out telling me windows has been stopped to prevent farther damage to your computer. then goies on to tell me to uninstall software, and run virus scan now you would think that would be easy however they way it stopped windows you can't even reformat the stupid computer. Was a really great computer but now makes a shiny paper weight. If you plan on using this computer longer than a year it is not the computer for you. very low frame rate so not very good for any games either. basically if you just want to do homework and business work this computer is good otherwise just pass this computer by that is my recomindation."
2,Not worth buying.,Mary-Kate & Ashely are cute but this movie is not one of their best.I don't like any of their songs.
1,the worst produced mod ever and the music is weak!,"what is up with the cow bell on every song?this cd lacks production and real musicanship with the exception of 3 songs top billy milano should have saved the best song from this,red white and screwed and released and ep after working hard on improving them.like billy himself mod's music needs to be taken with a pinch of salt but these songs need to be spiced ups too."
2,"wHAT HAPPENED, bILLY?","Wow, this is not the MOD i once knew and loved.What happened to the great sounds of USA for MOD?This is mid-paced rock at best. Just another lazy effort on Billy Milano's part to avoid getting a job. This should be the ""Billy Milano band"" not under the moniker MOD.The cover spoof on MSG is a total classic, though!!Buy SOD instead!!"
4,The Least We Can Do....,"is listen. VDGG is an interesting band and it's worth having their records in your collection, but I wouldn't expect one to listen to them non-stop. Their performance is pretty good but nothing extraordinary. Hammil's composing skills can draw the same kind of praise, it's pretty good but nothing outstanding, besides his musical themes are often similar, in the same key (Darkness and White Hammer for example, pretty good tracks by the way), and it's quite noticeable after a couple of listens (only the Rolling Stones managed to massage the first 3 notes of Satisfaction to produce a dozen hits without being put on notice for self-plagiarism). In short, it's far from being a masterpiece although if I had to choose I would rather listen to VDGG than such ""titans"" as Pink Floyd and Genesis.It's between 3.5 and 4 stars."
5,The initiation of VDGG to the road to a creation and experimentation,David Jackson and Hugh Banton should be of VDGG. Peter Hammil was not enough. Listen to Quiet Zone and compare it with works from The least... to The World Record. The sound making with Saxophone and Banton's organ..
3,childs owl,"Child of the OwlChild of the Owl is an average book, it's about a Chinese girl that isn't wanted anywhere, and she loves her uncle. His name is Barney. He is a gambler, and he just lost big to big Mike. So she goes to paw paws house and lives there for a while. Many interesting things happen to Casey. Barney eventually gets his money back, and Casey lives with him. I did not like this book very much because, it got a little boring while Casey was at paw paw's house, there where a few interesting parts though, like when she went to her aunts house, her aunt had a husband and lots of other people in her family and they kept getting mad at Casey they thought she was dressed poorly and even thought she was a hoodlum. That was probably the most exciting and must interesting part in the story it was also very funny this books vocabulary was a little easy, and the author didn't use very many exciting words."
3,it was okay,I read this book a long time ago in middle school and personally was able to relate to some of her Casey's feelings and experiences but I don't really remember what happened in the story. Don't take my word for it because I never paid that much attention to what I read back then. It was okay and she resembles some of my cousin and me when we were younger but I guess my parents would've thought she was silly. Thats all I remembered about it and the rest was okay but I guess its been too long ago since I read this book to write a review for it anyway.
1,Cannibals in the Orient,"I hated this book. It was assigned for my boys in 8th grade and Chapter 2 is all about cannibalism and spirits haunting the dead night and day, crying out to the living to be saved. Give me a break. I have fought the school to get this book off of the curriculum as I found it inappropriate. There is no happy ending in this story -- and it makes the Chinese people look outrageous, which couldn't be farther from the truth. Don't get this book for your youngens, it will keep them up at night wondering if there is peace in the afterlife."
3,The child of the owl By Larence Yep,"This book is about a young girl who experinced how it fells to live between two culture.the main character of the book is Casey, Paw-Paw and Barney. Casey's father is a gambler who gamles from town to town to change his luck.mean while he sentCasey to live with her Paw-Paw in china town.Casey had lots of difficulties in china town.paw-paw have a owl charm and she belive her family have a owl spirit and this charm was passed to her family by generation to generation. Casey belive on that too.one day this owl charm was stolen.on the other hand Barney got scrud op in the gambling he kept losing. if u want to know what happend next you must read this book. i hope you like it . its a great book."
3,"Works, but leaves coat a little dry and flat looking","I bought this medicated shampoo as a replacement for Malaseb, which is no longer available. It worked to stop my cat's itching, but it left his coat a little dry and flat, rather than fluffy, soft, and silky. The next time I use it I'll mix it 50/50 with another shampoo to improve the finish."
4,Stops the Itch,My dogs get itchy if not bathed every few weeks. This shampoo is gentle and stops the itch. It's effective at cleaning up rashes too. It has a slightly chemical scent. I use a tearless shampoo on their head.
2,Not up to my expectations,"My little one is suffering from ringworm and he gets greasy a few days after shampoo. I have had hoped that this product would alleviate his skin problem but there seemed to be no improvement at all . Even worse, his skin showed signs of irritation (rashes) and his hair lost the shine and fluffiness as it used to be. Quite disappointed."
5,Great shampoo...,"I have been using this shampoo on my English Bulldog and my Westie for about 3 years. I tried to save money and switch to a cheaper shampoo and their skin became flaky, itchy and dry. I went back to this product and their skin is much better. They get weekly baths and it does not dry them out.I would recommend the product to anyone, especially with High Maintenance English Bulldogs."
4,Stopped the Itch,I purchased this shamppoo because my Mastiff was having severe itching. It has somewhat controlled it. But it is to soon to tell. But I recommened it to everyone.
3,Dog skin conditioner,"The Shampoo works well, and my groomer recommends it. My Veterinarian also stocks it. It's pretty expensive for use on large dogs. It does loosen scale and improve the skin."
5,Really Helps,I have used this product on my two doxies for years. I can not live without this shampoo for the dogs.
4,decent,"Yah, this is a decent tome. It's something to leave on your coffee table to upset your Mom when she visits. Some good info, lots of laughs, and well, what's not to like?"
2,Leaves a lot to be desired,"A few kitchy and well worn jokes aside, this book falls flat with its abundance of stereotypes and stupid in-jokes. This is NOT a book for those who are just coming out or exploring - there is too much ""humor"" that would seem threatening and alienating to a newbie.Overall, not worth the money, not worth your time."
2,"So stupid, it's funny.","I received this book as a gag gift from my mom. It's not really much more than that. It's a dumb, ridiculous book, and it's difficult to understand who the book is really written for. Even though it's a joke, it only furthers negative stereotypes about women.There's even a section on ""Bad Jokes."" In this reveiwers opinion, the whole book is a bad joke."
3,quickly becomes tiresome,"maybe because it was written several year ago, or maybe due to my jaded proximity to San Francisco, but i thought this book was lame. i was debating about giving it two stars -- it's not very well written -- but it does touch on aspects of lesbian life as promised. i mean a feather-weight, barely there touch, and not the delicious kind that can give you goosebumps. if you're looking for something silly and shallow, or a gift for a just-out 15 year old in the Midwest, it will suit your tastes (ahem). otherwise, there are better reads around."
5,Hilarious without skimping on substance,"Tracey and Pokorny have done their homework. In addition to the familiar topics (butch vs. femme, crunchy vs. extra-crunchy, date etiquette), they thoroughly cover such topics as 20th-century historical figures, literature, and music. I found myself wanting to read ""just one more page"" of this laugh-out-loud, informative book"
3,A solid album,"Released in 2004, Geile Zeit is Münchener Freiheit's thirteenth studio album. A reason that I find this German band to be remarkable is because they sing in their native tongue; that is helpful to me because I am a student of the German language. Other aspects that make them remarkable are their well-crafted pop songs, Stefan Zauner's smooth, serene lead vocals, and the band's lush, engaging harmony vocals. Clocking in at almost 50 minutes, this piece of work consists of 13 compositions. My favorite tracks are ""Du und ich,"" ""Das ist einfach so,"" and ""Leuchtturm."" I like the slow burning ""Du und ich"" with its lavish vocal harmonies. ""Das ist einfach so"" displays a pretty refrain, while Zauner pulls off a nice, emotional singing performance on the finessed ""Leuchtturm."" When it comes to the CD booklet, it includes the song lyrics. Also, behind the CD tray is a color photo of the group. Geile Zeit is a good album, and I recommend it."
1,Did ANYONE proofread this book?,"First off, let me say the text of this book is not bad. Not great, but not bad. The photos and captions are awful and the real problem. I have never seen so many caption errors in one book. Time and again tanks and events are completely mis-captioned. The cover photo is wrong- it shows a T34 model 1940 tank. Given the devastation of the Red Army in the early years the chances this particular tank is present at a battle in summer 1943 are NIL! From there it just goes on and on. Must be at least a dozen glaring erros. I would never buy another book from this publsiher based on this product."
3,a better than average study of Kursk,"I found this to being a good and detailed study of the battle. Much I discovered was quite new to me. I thought is was nicely illustrated too.I do confess that I am not sure I agree with the author a victory at Kursk was achievable by the Germans still it could be argued it was the first time in the East that the German war aims were something reasonable. It was a battle that was Germans last chance of dominating the East, this, they failed and this is the importance of the result in Kursk."
1,I-Man,"Don't bother buying this if you are viewing from any Sony device. They're programmed in Region 1 and are thus incompatible. I remember liking this movie a lot as a child and wanted to return to those happy childhood memories. But alas, my memories will have to suffice."
4,dvd,"It is sad that I cannot see this on our tv, but at least it works on our computer.I really enjoyed seeing it again. It has been a long time.It arrived in a timely manner. Thank you."
1,I-Man,"Very disappointed with Amazon that you would put this foreign version of I-man on an American site. If you can't obtain the American version then you should not put anything at all, we can't even watch it. I'm sending mine back and I hope I get a refund on this foreign film. I will from now on check to make sure the region is 1."
1,i was so excited,i was so excited to see a movie from my childhood i man to be exact it was delivered quickly but when i got it out and put it in the blue ray player it said error wrong reagon so i took it into the other room to try a regular dvd player and the same thing it is so frustrating trying to find something and finding it for it not to work and be back at the begening trying to find that one movie that had so many other memories i hope to fix this issue and post a more possitive comment
2,Smells like burning plastic,The fan fills my home with a very strong odor of burning plastic each time I turn it on. I do like the design and strength of the unit but the odor of burnt plastic is headache-inducing and annoying.
1,hf810 Trouble Fan,This is a very poor quality fan. The on and off switch is very poorly located and is difficult to find for anyone who is not familiar with the fan. The switch also gets stuck. I strongly do not recommend this fan.It is definitely falsely described.
3,L -3 1/2 stars,"After steve hillage's magnificent debut, much less his incredible work with gong which practically defined the role of space rock guitar, the sophmore 'L' is a somewhat more staight ahead performance. This album still participates in the joyous cosmology but also introduces more basic songcraft('electrick gypsy' 'it's all too much') where his personality becomes more clearly defined. Though not as spectacular as 'fish rising', this album literally has astounding psychedelic guitar work all over it with the excellant support of utopia(particularly the bass). 'lunar music suite' meanders a tad, and some of the songs toward the end are weaker than the others, but the guitar work is beyond superb."
5,An Acoustic Guitar/Peter Mayer fan.,After following Jimmy Buffett for years I had a chance to see Peter perform live all by himself. I was absolutely blown away. When you hear his original music you'll wonder why Jimmy Buffett only lets him play C F and G chords. I invite anyone who is a fan of accomplished music to buy this album. It has a little bit of everything and a lot of talent. Peter is not only a great musician but also a very talented songwriter. If you don't believe me buy it and you'll see!
1,Utter waste of time,I find this book to be the worst kind of slander ever written. The author is a mook.--Sadakichi Hartmann
5,Return,"I loved this book, however some of the pages were unprinted. I would like to send it back to you for a complete one. I have dogeared the missing pages. Please advise."
3,"Not great, author is a woodwind player",Did not find this book helpful for me. Author is a woodwind (sax) player who has taught many brass players.
2,terrible,"What a waste of time. We have probably seen every dog movie available. This one is so formulaic, boring, and over-acted. We never laughed."
3,MOM SAYS I'M HALF BEAVER,"This is a great movie for an immature audience who can appreciate blows to the crotch and poo humor, mostly the 10 and under crowd. Chris Parnell gave us a substandard performance and is perhaps on his way to being the most over rated bad actor in Hollywood (move over Will Ferrell). The funniest part of the movie was at the very end when the dog was doing an interview and let us know what was wrong with the film. The women in the movie were all fine looking, something to keep dad's interest, should he have to sit through it. The jokes were stale and slapstick humor abound. The godfather impersonation was bad, and I don't know if a 9 year old could appreciate it. Adults tend to be stupid in this film (the males anyway) and kids are reasonable. Not the worse film for family night, but you could do way better."
5,This is NOT a pre-school book!,"This is a great story I remember fondly from my childhood. I see that the reading level has been listed as ""Baby/Pre-School"" - it is at a reading level of about primary through secondary school, it is NOT a baby book!"
2,TO CHEAPLY MADE,"Length:: 0:21 MinsI was excited when i found these here on Amazon. but when i got them i was pretty annoyed.. i know im gonna be replacing these again, because they fall right out of the DS. so i would not recommend this at all...the stylus are way to short and way to thin, it doesnt fit snugly in. so i hope this video and review helped. :)"
2,Buyer Beware,"These DS Styluses are not worth the money. I wanted something that would fit into the DS stylus slot like the original. It did not. It falls right out. That's why they include 3 of them, because you'll lose them very quickly."
1,Terrible,Yes they were new but they don't even stay in my ds. It keeps falling out. Next time I will be sure to buy namebrand and not generic.
2,Don't fall for the low price - they gouge you on shipping.,"Be aware that these ""99"" styluses come with a disproportionately high shipping fee for something that fits in a standard envelope. In addition, they are of noticeably poor quality - much less than that of the Nintendo's own stylus, and fit in the stylus tray somewhat tentatively. You could find better styluses at the same price elsewhere."
2,Doesn't even fit well.,"I have the original DS and these stylus' don't ""lock"" in they slip out if you tip it over. I had to put tape around the top so it stayed put. Don't recommend these."
2,Too small for the original Nintendo DS,I purchased these for my Daughters Nintendo DS. This is the original DS. These Stylus are too small and so fall out of the designated hole on the unit. Consequently all three are now also lost and I shall have to purchase some more replacements. I am very disappointed as I researched and the description advertises for the size I needed. I won't buy again unless I can see and make sure the size is correct.
2,"Timely Delivery, Doesn't Properly Fit Nintendo DS","I know it's a bit odd to write a review for such a basic and inexpensive item, but reading this may avoid some frustration and headache. The stylus' work fine. However, if you try to slide them into the stylus slot in your Nintendo DS, you will see that they are smaller than the Nintendo brand equivalent and will get stuck. So, either you pick it out with a knife each time you use it, or you stow your stylus elsewhere (and hence lose it easily)."
2,Incorrect stylus,"I ordered these hoping to replace the stylus for my original DS. I received 3 styli for the NDS Lite, not the the styli for the original DS as pictured. These do not fit the stylus slot for the original DS."
2,Wrong system...,They advertised these for the Nintendo DS. I got them for the Nintendo DS Lite. I don't have a Nintendo DS Lite. You can imagine how angry I am.
1,Not the Product I Expected,Then pens that I received were not the same as I had expected. The ones were for Nintendo DS LITE and not for the first Nintendo DS (the fatter one).
2,Stylus,These stylus do not fit the Nintendo DS stylus holder therefore my child has lost all three of them. The description should say state that these are not the proper stylus for the game system. I am not happy with my purchase.
1,afl10ac,This makes the second time I ordered the 3 pack Plastic Stylus that says they fit the Nintendo DS but they DO NOT fit properly. Either they are too short or they just fall out of the holder. I wanted new ones because I'm trying to sell the DS but if the stylus does not fit then I probably can't sell it. Not sure why someone can't make one that fits. I didn't return any of them because they were so cheap but I'm disappointed they don't fit. Will not order any more.
1,Didn't work with my DS,"We have the original DS (the one that came out before the DS lite or DS i). This stylus does not ""snap"" into the storage slot on the back of the DS, as claimed. It's way too small. Just loose in there, and falls right out. I don't know what kind of DS these are made for, but not ours."
1,Disappointed,"These ARE NOT DS styluses. They DO NOT fit in the stylus slot, and will more than likely be lost in a couple days. Price and shipping were great, but it doesn't make up for the fact that these are not what they are labeled/ advertised as. So basically, in a week when my son needs a stylus cause all of these teeny tiny NOT DS styluses are gone, I won't be ordering these again."
4,Great for DS,"I didn't pay attention to the specs and thought I was purchasing a pen that would work with the DS Lite. However, it wouldn't stay in the little pocket. This was totally my fault - I'm sure it works GREAT with the regular DS!"
1,"Awful, horrible, abismal, terrible, False advertisement","Okay, so, I ordered this more than a month ago. Then, when I received my order, I found it to be wrong. The styluses I received were for the DS lite. NOT THE ORIGINAL DS, which is what was advertised. Hell, even the image is of the original DS stylus. So, I contacted the seller Westronics, only to not receive any word back from them. Ever. Now, my return window has expired, and I'm stuck with these stylus for which I have no use. Okay, so this is a, rather odd gripe, but the fact that I cannot store it in my DS while not using them, is annoying. In fact, that's the only reason I bought these. If I wanted ones like this, I could have just gone to the store. And so, I end my rant. DON'T buy from them. DO NOT give them your money, and lastly (Unless you have a ds lite) DON'T purchase this item."
3,"Work great, but this is some very expensive plastic","There's not much to these styli,.... just black molded plastic. Although you can use just about anything to operate the NDS touch screen, if you want a stylus that you can tuck away into the slot on the base, you'll need a correctly sized stylus. They work fine, no complaints. It's amazing how much these cost for what you get. Maybe the packaging costs a lot to produce??? Anyhow, everyone sells them at this rip-off price, so it's the only choice you have for the 'original' NDS (which uses different styli than the NDS Lite)."
1,Not the stylus that is pictured,The stylist pictured are stylists for the Orginal DS but the ones you get are the ones for the DS lite
4,Not much to say...,There really isn't that much that you can say about these styli (stylus'?)They do their job. Goes with the original DS (not DS lite)
1,doesn't fit,despite saying it would fit it was too fat kind of defeats the purpose. guess it was good it had 3 so when we lose them we'll have more
2,Smaller than Expected,"I was disappointed to find that the styli were smaller than I had expected. I was looking for one that would be about as long as the ones that fit in the DS game system. These were about 1/2 the length of that. These were going to be used on a piece of gps layout equipment that we have at the construction company I work for, but given their tiny size (3"" in length) there is no way I can expect our workers to keep track of, and not lose, this stylus. It may have said the size in the description, but i did not catch onto it, and I can almost guarantee that it wouldn't stay in the stylus holder spot on a DS as well."
1,Not for NDS lite!,"I bought this for a DS lite...and they dont fit on the slot 'cause this are a lot smaller, won't fit long or wide. Seller MUST be clear on this. they dont work for DS lite, too tiny. Wasted a few bucks here."
2,Picture is misleading,These stylus are WAY smaller then they appear in the picture. I thought they would be like the normal Nintendo DS stylist but they are much smaller & flimsy.
2,False description,"Although inexpensive and usable, they are not for the DS system and do not fit into the stylus slot. The product description is misleading."
1,DS Stylus,"Someone doesn't seem to know the difference between DS and DS lite. I read the review that spoke to how short and small the stylus' were. For a penny I almost bought several packs. I tend to fall asleep and simply lose the darn thing. Now I use narrow guage fishing line to tie my last TRUE DS stylus to the hinge. The package actually said it was for DS lite. But on your site it only said DS. So one of your vendors has it wrong, since one of your reviewers got the real thing that fits into the pocket. Right now I can't check my old order, and have already lost them so can't return them. I will check and let you know. Sincerely, E. Zaharopoulos."
3,"Expensive, but they work (DS Phat)","If you're looking for a replacement for a DS Phat (as opposed to a Lite), these are that."
2,Really?,"I would give this a one star, except it is attractive. It fit the first time but after that it no longer fit. In fact it leaked. Need I say more? If you want a tight for wine look for a different maker."
4,Powerful positive and motivating,"Julies personal story of her life and the health challange she has faced was heartfelt and honest, positively inspiring and will help motivate you to take charge of your own health. An easy and uplifting book to read."
5,Awesome product,"This product is amazing! My mother, who is near deaf due to age, can hear like a kid again! The only downside is that it only lasts 4 hrs at a time."
4,Excellent head set.,"I first experienced a Sennheiser head set (RI 250) at a friend's house. Because of some hearing loss, my wife and I listen to sounds (TV, music) at different comfort levels. The 810 set produces a wonderful, dynamic sound. Now we can watch TV together without having to compromise. Don't know how we got along without it.William StaubachRotonda West, FL.August, 2007.Meanwhile, I bought 2 additional sets of the Sennheiser ... for the bedroom and the RV. Still believe it's a great product, and it works!"
4,Seinheiser,I bought this for my hard of hearing father who complained frequently that he couldn't make out what was being said on TV. He was delighted instantly with this listening system. It is so comfortable for him to wear that he forgets he has it on. He is enjoying movies and shows a lot more now that he knows what is going on.I think it is unusual looking and wish someone could design one that doesn't look so strange when wearing.But the unit did what it said it would. And I don't have to listen to the TV at top volume any longer!
5,They really work!,"I bought these for my Dad, but it was really to keep Mom sane. My Dad kept the t.v. at volume 10 all the time...very annoying! Now he uses these when she's around and keeps the t.v. volume low or even muted. The volume of the t.v. can be set at any level regardless of what level he listening to with the headphones. The headphones hang down from his ears and are very light...he says they aren't heavy or irritating at all. I recommend this product not only to folks who have a hearing impairment, but also to anyone who wants to be able to watch t.v. without disturbing the other people in the house."
2,Too much static,"The first couple days it seemed to work fairly well, even though it had a bit of static in the background. After that the static became louder than the audio on the TV, so I returned it.I would have given it a rating of 1 star, but thought perhaps I just received a defective one. However, I didn't bother to order another, because after seeing it I felt it wasn't worth the price. Hence the 2-star rating."
3,Not so easy to connect to the TV!,"I experienced the device at my mother's house and thought it was fabulous. Now I have one at my house , but simply connecting it the way the directions in the book describe won't produce any sound. Must have a wiring person help. My mother said that she, too, had to have professional help setting it up."
2,Half the Ear Power,"I bought this more expensive TV cordless earphone set to replace an old set which had died (different brand with larger style hearphones). Unfortunately, after setting it up we found that only one side of the earphones on the headset worked. We then tried the old headset from our broken TV listening set with the same result. Apparently, the problem is with the central unit, not the headphones themselves. We decided to bite the bullet and keep this set anyway, however Rick has chosen to use the old earphones with this TV listening set. What gets me is that I could have spent half the money with probably much better results."
5,"At last, my favorite ""Bob""",I have been hoping this Bob Newhart series would turn up on DVD. It's a no-brainer purchase for me. This is the funniest show that Newhart ever did. The network scuttled by by moving it around & pre-empting it with football. There was no need to change the concept to the greeting card company scene. The original cast of characters was perfect right down to the cat. My favorite episode is the Thanksgiving parade episode. It's right up there with Lucy & the Chocolate factory & Carol Burnett as Scarlett Ohara. I can die happy now.Tracey
3,"LOVE the show, but not these dvds.","This show is so adorable, and I've waited years for it to come to dvd. I'm just disappointed that you have to press buttons over and over to eventually make it play, and that the episodes don't flow in a play-all manner. These days, if you want to sit and watch for hours at a time, dvds normally allow you to do that. If I wanted to wrestle with my remote every 20 minutes I might as well take up pilates."
1,RETURNED,I returned this because it arrived with the metal can dented badly. Looked like it was used. The talc itself smelled good. I will order from another vendor.
1,Does not work for 64-bit Windows,"The Cisco Aironet wireless adapter does not work for 64-bit Windows. I found this information impossible to find with repeated web searches and so am warning potential buyers here after personal experience.Furthermore, the account creation process and driver update process that Cisco uses is a nightmare. If you are not a Cisco Partner or business affiliate there is no method for the end-user to download updated drivers from Cisco themselves. It can take up to 12 hours after account creation for it to be registered in their system and it is then flagged as a ""guest account"" with virtually no privileges(for instance, accessing driver downloads).I returned this product. Highly NOT recommended."
1,Not a good book if you want to learn Visual Studio 6.0,"This book is not what the title implies. It is poorly written for beginners, and I suspect people who already have some knowledge of Visual Studio would be confused. The author sort of rambles on about how great and powerful Visual Studio is and never really gets into step by step hands on instruction. It is mainly devoted to writing web pages and he never really gets into the different programs specifically. This is not a good book if you want to learn Visual Studio and should not be in the ""Dummies"" series."
2,Only Half of the Whole Studio,"This book is not for beginners...something the author actually says in the book. I expected to get a general introduction to the various programs found in the studio and how these programs relate to each other. Instead, I found undue concentration on InterDev and Front Page (which no longer is part of the Studio) in the context of the Internet. If this is what you want then buy the book, otherwise look for something else."
1,Visual Studio for Dummies,"The book is not for beginners. I tried to go thru the very first exercise and hit a ""snag"". The author has no E Mail address to ask questions. This book is not worth the price!"
1,poor quality,"I bought the raincoat for unexpected rainy weather. The size advertised was 2 sizes below expectation, and I had to return it. The replacement had a missing button, and a terrible design and fit. I had to cut it to make it fit. And it weighs a ton. It is probably suited for someone needing a firemans uniform or some place where they have daily huricanes."
5,The BEST Cisco Press book EVER,"I have read dozens of Cisco titles, and this book is by far the best! Whether you are studying for The security Written or Lab, or for the R&S lab This book is the best resource money can buy!"
3,love hate,"I both loved and hated ""Devil in a Kilt"". The story included many elements that I enjoy in a historical novel; set in the Highlands, an alpha laird, a strong heroine who is sweet but strong and brings joy to the wounded heart of the laird, good love scenes. But I did not enjoy chapter 16. I was so frustrated by the stupidity of Linnet that I wanted to throw the book across the room. There were also moments throughout the book when I thought Duncan not very lairdly; letting his warriors and his friends push him around. Despite these flaws, I would recommend this book. Chapters 1 through 15 and 17 to the end are a good ole Highland romance."
4,Enjoyable Read,I have read many of her books under her pen name Allie Mackay and enjoyed them. I was happy to find more of her books under the name Sue Ellen Welfonder. I haven't been disappointed yet. Her books are great reads and thoroughly enjoyable. I am on the second in this series and look forward to reading the rest!
5,Devil in a Kilt,I recommended to anyone who hasn't read Sue-Ellen Welfonder work. She is a great author and you won't be disappointed.
3,Devil in a Kilt,"This is the first book I've read by Sue-Ellen Welfonder and it problably won't be the last. I didn't really like the cover at first but then after I got into the story I really could see the model on the front being Duncan. He is a troubled man who has been bitterly betrayed by his first wife and is said to have killed her for the betrayal. He is unsure whether his son is actually his son so he weds Linnet, a woman who is reported to have the gift of sight to tell him what he needs to know.Linnet is torn from all that she has known to a far away castle by a man who weds her but only wants her for her gift. She is determined to make him love his son no matter his parentage. she also wishes for his love for herself and hopes to bring laughter and happiness back into his life.I liked this book and I would like to see a sequel about Duncan's best friend Maraduke, a man who's scars go deeper than the flesh."
2,Not for the thinking reader...,"Just for the mere fact that the author probably worked extremely hard to complete this book, proving to have more discipline and mettle than myself at this time, I give it 2 stars. (It would be 5 if that was all i was judging). Otherwise, I found the story itself to be a bit trite. It could have been a lot better without some of the eye-rolling metaphors and silly characters whose bodies seem to be able to perform some pretty super human feats in the bedroom. I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a great romance, but I would if you're looking for a good laugh."
3,A Question of Faith,"A good movie and worth the time spent watching it. The Body brings up some very seriouse philosophical points, mixed with science and relidgeon, and a belief still held fast by faith.A Body of a crucified man found in a tomb reserved for the rich, concealed and bearing all the crucifixion marks, even the crown of thorns and a spear in the side. Is it really the body of Christ??? and what happens to the world, our beliefs, and our way of life if it is found that it is.The Body has very little in the way of extras and bonus materials, having only two trailors and a filmography of banderras. Still a good movie, and at the very least worth a rental."
2,Not the Best Movie,"While The Body does raise some interesting theological questions, it wasn't a well put together movie. The acting felt forced, the characters were not believable and it seemed that the movie itself was so low budget that no one cared. And casting Antonio Banderas as a priest was laughable. There are other actors who could have done the job more believably and credibly than him for this role."
1,The Body,was never able to view this movie. I didn't realize when I ordered it that it was in Region 2 format. I will not work in my player. So have never had the chance to see this movie.
2,another Catholic bash,"Why does it seem that every movie that portrays themes involving the Catholic Chuch, contains either an excorcism of a demon or the Church in a sinister and subversive form? I looked forward greatly to seeing this movie, the actors and above all the concept of the discovery of the 'body of Christ', but left frustrated... The movie would have increased its level of credibility if the central actors portraying members of the Church were not either going insane, hiding the possible truth in an insideous way, or throwing off their collar in contempt for the Church. Let's have some balance here. I really looked forward to this film, but was let down."
2,They RUINED a great book/ending,"This movie was based on a book I read back in the early 90's or late 80's. And that book had one of the BEST book endings of all times! Unfortunately the director, for some unfathomable reason, COMPLETELY changed and RUINED the ending. If you can find the original book get it and read it (I unfortunately gave my copy to someone and never got it back and have been unsuccessful in finding it in ANY bookstore). Do yourself a favor - pass on this movie. In the book the characters are lead to believe an incorrect explanaition for what they found. Then in about a page and a half, the author provides a surprise ending that is a WHOLLOP of a great suprise ending! Again - take a pass on this movie."
5,The Body - Antonio Banderas - Review,"Good Movie, delivered promply, in good condition. Movie is new.five stars for provider"
1,Picky on Discs,"I really regret buying this. I bought a big stack of TDK DVDs to use, but this machine won't accept them. They recommend Panasonic DVDs in the manual... no other recommended or tested. I wish I would have read more of the other reviews on this product. It's not too bad for the money as long as you don't expect it to accept a lot of DVDs!"
1,Beware!! You cannot record HBO movies with this device!,"This, and all Toshiba brand DVD recorders contain provisions that prevent you from copying any materials that contain a copy protection prevention signal from the premium cable services."
1,"Stay away-wastes discs, convoluted interface","I could play craps and have better odds winng than I would of getting a working burn with this coaster maker.It seems to record OK when first turned on, but eject the disc properly through the menu and you can forget about appending more to it or finalizing it. Sometimes it fails and says ""DISC MAY NEED CLEANING OR IS DAMAGED PHYSICALLY"" if you hit stop and wish to record a few minutes later. Tried seven different brands of media with 3 countries of origin-Japan,Taiwan,India.DVD-RAM seems to be OK, but formatting can take up an hour.The interface is convoluted, confusing, and inconsistent.How something like this gets past quality control and testing is beyond me. Goodbye Toshiba!"
1,Disappointment,"I received the product quickly, but it was defective. I had a tech come to my house to make sure that it was defective and not just something I was doing wrong. The vendor said I could return it and a replacement would be shipped. That never happened. About a month after the original order, I gave up, canceled the order, and bought a similar product locally."
2,Ridiculously difficult,"They warn you - its like a computer.But am experiencing difficulty burning DVD-R discs. So, I have burned on DVD-RW, then copy to DVD-R. So much for simple.Not sure why it is so particular. The DVD-RAM capabilities are good - like editing, but how do you transfer to a DVD-R (for cheap use and copies)??Unhappy with the purchase - and Costco dropped the price $50 within 45 days. A double negative!!!"
2,keep it simple,"I have had this machine for about a month and have thought about returning it several times. If you have had trouble seting up a VCR,forget about this one. Much to complex for most.Who needs all these features? Seventy or so buttons on the remote. Only fair documentation. Get an electronics degree before you buy one. I will say the quality is good but I preffer my simple VCR."
3,A Decent Wood Frame,"This is a decent frame, fairly priced for what you get. It has a scratch prone plexiglass cover for the print rather than a glass one (theMALDEN DESIGNS 673-42 4""x12"" BLACK PANORAMIC PICTURE FRAMEhas about the same quality of construction with a glass cover. Both are wood frames. The Malden version is made for sitting on a desk or table in either orientation, but doesn't wall hang well out of the box. This frame comes with hardware to hang from the wall, but not to sit on a desk."
1,Required Reading,"As an executive trainee for a large retail company, I was required to read this book. Benton gives pointers on how to be a clone, a sell out, a working stiff with no sense of individuality or concern for others.It was poorly written and thoroughly disgusting.Bleh."
1,The book blows...,Required reading for me as well and it was drivel. Pick anything but don't pick this book.
2,"Reasonably Valuable Information, But Failed to Maintain My Interest","The concepts in this book are certainly valuable to people in the corporate culture. Whether you are (or want to be) the type of person that the book describes, it is always useful in understanding the motivations and/or actions of others around you (i.e.-your colleagues a.k.a. your competition). However, this book was not written in a manner that commanded my attention, and was unsuccessful at keeping my interest."
1,Socket holes too small to allow me to plug my TV cord into,Had to return it unfortunately. I have no idea why they made the socket holes so small. My flat screen TV was purchased at Best Buy in NYC. No excuse for why it didn't fit like it should have. Waste of my time and money.
3,Amazon Spoiled the Dust Cover!,"This is a beautiful book - the poem was a favorite of my grandmother who used to recite it to us. The book has beautiful illustrations. The dog, especially, is very like the Doulton china salt shaker my grandmother kept on the breakfast room table. It would have been perfect, except that Amazon slapped a big ugly price sticker right on the front dust cover that is very hard to remove. I'm working on it, but some will remain! And guess what, I cannot find a place where I can send this complaint directly to amazon! So it has to be here where they probably wont look."
1,Gingham Dog and Calico Cat,I ordered this book for my aunt from Awesome Books. I never received it. It was a huge disappointment. Awesome books said they mailed it. I did get reimbursed a month after the order went in. I guess they don't track their orders. I would be hesitant to order from Awesome again.
5,"Lucid, stringent criticism","I wish someone like Sorrentino were writing today in publications like ""The New York Times Book Review."" Many of the essays in this book are short reviews, of a page or two. A few are slightly longer essays on key figures like Williams and Spicer. What is amazing is how often Sorrentino is right. His style is vigorous, his judgments firm. The line about John Gardner alone is worth the price of admission: ""We are struck ... that Mr. Gardner is one of those 'writers who cannot write,"" a Robert Bly of fiction."
4,This is a great book with new and unique perspectives.,"This is a great book which gives a new perspective to the Texas War for Independence, and the Mexican War. He explains himself very well and blames himself some, but mostly his subordiantes. He is very respectful to the American and Texas forces. This book is a must read for 1840's enthusiasts!"
5,Love My Best Friends,If you have a breed of dog that is going to have dental problems than take any precaution you can to help your best friend keep his or her teeth. This product is great and I recommend it for your dogs dental care. The best price I can find was on Amazon and this is not the first time shopping Amazon.
3,Off Smell this time,"I usually buy from the local pet store, but then I moved. Then I went to Wysong to order and their shipping cost was obscene, so I chose an Amazon vendor (NewPuppyPads). The bottle I got had an off smell. I've bought this several times. I know what it is supposed to smell like. I'm still giving it to my dog, but it doesn't seem to be working very well. Nor am I positive that it is good for him ... so that makes me uncomfortable. He seems fine though.For what it is worth, in general I think this is a fantastic product. It usually works miracles and within days/week my dog's teeth are white again. Also, I complained to the Wysong people about their shipping costs and they replied within hours with an email offering free shipping. But it was too late. I had already ordered from Amazon and it had already shipped. They really need to do something about the cost of their shipping. I was all set to order from their website and then canceled it at the last minute."
5,what a sweet book!,"What a pleasant surprise! This book was actually very different than i expected. Not as functional as a guide toward decorating as what i thought it would be. But this is a book to be had! It is more of a small coffeetable type book, but how adorable this will be in my baby's nursery someday!Beautiful pictures and neat sayings. And once you start reading it, you will find useful information, and humorous parts, too! 5 Stars!"
1,mini book,This is a pocket book!! Don't buy it save your money for a real book. It is absolutely worthless.
4,Lots of fun!,"We discovered these vidoes at the local library and my son LOVES them. We gave them to him for his 5th birthday. My other children (and sometimes husband) enjoy watching them, too. They are fast paced, exciting, and interesting. I'd like to know if they are going to be making more movies..."
4,Entertaining,"This has provided hours of entertainment for my family, all members. There is some violence, no one dies. Shows teamwork and cooperation. Excellent series."
1,"Not happy with shipping, item has not yet been received","I would LOVE to review the product only I have not received my shippment of the Hot Wheels Acceleracers Boxed Set yet, and my delivery date was suppose to be around the 8th of January.Please assist with this problem, and I do appreciate the reveiw request, very professional of Amazon to followup.N. Guyett, January 18, 2008"
5,way to go,I bought this for my 6 year olds b- day and i must admit he flipped over it. I can't wait till the next parts come out.. If you have a child who likes hot wheels you can't go wrong with this.
4,dvd rom features requires a decoder,The seriers is great. My son loves them and has finally seen the whole set. But when it came time for the extras...it wasn't compatable with my brand new computer. It needs some sort of decoder to access the rest of the special features so it's a little dissapointing. Other than that the set is great.
1,"I second the ""do not waste your money"" reviews","The other reviews have discussed each major shortcoming of the game is detail, so I will not repeat them. Rent the game for a fun hour or so of arcade style playing, but do not waste your money buying the game."
3,Somewhat disapointment,"This should have been a great game instead its just ok,this graphics are good at times,the controls are nothing new,the dialouge during gameplay is annoying(Japanese zero pilot every 30 seconds yelling ""YOU HAVE NO HONOR"")that becomes really really anoying.Like one reviewer below said this games diffuculty is unbalanced it starts out to easy becomes frustratingly hard,you know its one of those you dont die but run out of time games,every stage has a time limit and the time seems to always slip away much like me and this game I think I will put Burnout revenge back in tonight.Rent the thing i thought it would be a sure hit and im out $65.00 more importantly though I could have bought a diffrent game urrrr!"
2,Too Many things missing - disappointing,The graphics were just ok.The missions were ok but not explained well and not enough of them.You should have been able to select which plane you flew.You should have been able to tell your altitude and air speed.There were no binoculars.The game would not let you climb real high.The flight patterns of the enemy were unrealistic.The torpedo dropping and bombing were unrealistic.I liked the wingman feature and the fact that they listened to your instructions. It was the only strategy part of the game.I got the feeling that the creators of the game just wanted to throw something out there for the 360 without much planning or thought.
3,Its no crimson skies.,"I love crimson skies, and i had this game in mind when i picked up blazing angels. This game is nowhere even close to the game crimson skies was. The dogfight matches are very slow paced, and aiming is harder than you think. Something that makes the dog fights boring is that you are caught turning constantly. In cromson skies you could do a spin around are stuff like that. In this you cannot. i know the game is trying to be a bit more realistic, but since this feature is not in the game, the dog fights go very very slowly and end up in alot of turning and shooting randomly. The game is very boring, but the graphics are great. Is worth the extra money for the 360 version if you have a choice and enjoy the game"
2,Lame! Lame! Lame!,"This game could have been cool, but they dropped the ball. Were they trying to make a flight sim or a cartoon? When I first saw it I thought: Cool, 42 flyable planes and not just the obligitory ME 109 and mustang. But then I saw that you had to ""earn"" the ability to unlock all the planes. I hate that!!! I see the reasoning for that in a racing game, but I should be able to pick aircraft/mission type in a flight sim. The absolute worst part of the game are the obnoxious, supposedly funny, radio chatter. I know for a fact that allied and axis pilots DID NOT insult eachother via the radio, they did not speak their adversaries native language, and they did not all sound like Col. Klink. A real combat pilot would have been too busy using his radio for communicating with his wingmen, tower,etc and NOT hurling annoying, childish ""insults"" over the radio. Don't buy this game."
2,Pretty Bad,"Unless youre a huge fan of WW2 planes dont get this, i dont know what happened but if they spent some more time on this it couldve been decent.But they didnt from the begining it looks like they rushed this into production, i meen you can see the game drawing the lines while youre flying around, its pretty distracting, and the gameplay and story line is just as bad, n fact its so bad i dont even want to write any more about it."
3,"Starts off easy, gets unplayable","The game looks great, the gameplay progresses from easy at first to pretty much unplayable with barely realistic goals and time limits.The movie cutscenes aren't skippable which really stinks when you've done the same mission a dozen times or so, and the same lame commentary comes on again.The Multiplayer is good, though, and the planes really do look awesome.Honestly the game single player campaign mode frustrated me so much to get it done, that I'm not even sure I'll play another Ubisoft game.If that's what you go for, this game is a 10. It's more like a 6 for me."
1,a big dissapointment,"some of the ubisoft flight sims are wonderful , like il 2 or il2 sturmovic .. this was a bit of a dissapointment , for one , i have a fairly new dell dimension 3000. , to play this game i had to spend another 80 upgrading my video card wich was fine .. then my saitek joy stick would not work as it was not supported , so i spent another 50 on the reccommend logitec.. the older flight sims are great simply as you plug in a joystick and can fly .. not so with this game .. you have to try to set each direction as well as down load pathes for the game and joy stick and after all that , does not work .. the graphics are ok and i am sure the game might even be fun . but not worth all the headache , extra expense and still a joy stick that does not let you fly .. ubisoft used to care about what they put out .. but nowadays expensive games , with bugs , patches and games that just do not workk ."
3,maddening deficits make it hard to enjoy,"i was really looking forward to using the sixaxis in a game that should be well suited to it. the scenery is pretty good for the most part. enemy planes are way to easy to shoot down, perhaps that is only in campaign mode? any plane i select flys well in motion sensitive-arcade and very poorly when set to motion sensitive-simulator mode. the arcade campaigns are nearly impossible to win and therefore become endless. the game infuriated me several times when a hard won ""checkpoint"" (that would have finally freed me from campaign hell) was lost when i next opened the game... product seems rushed to market but there has been no patch etc, so i guess now that B.A.II is coming out this version is as good as it gets."
2,Fun but has its problems,"I've had this game for about a month now. The graphics and game play are pretty decent, but quick manuevers will cause incredibly bad screen tear. The control methods are unusual and require a longer than average learning curve. It will take a couple of missions to get used to flying the planes effectively. The game overall is fun to play and the variety of aircraft is great, but the poor control layout (which is unchangable) and horrific screen tear during extreme dogfighting drops this game to a 2 star rating. Should cost $30 at best."
2,Very Disappointing,"Positives: Ubisoft is known for their outstanding graphics. --And this is why I bought it.Negatives: Oh, let me count the ways. Controls are terrible. Camera angle(s) and instruments are a disaster. Annoying radio chatter that actually confuses by leading one to believe the objective of a mission is actually something else. JUST READ EVERYBODY ELSE's review.In short, I am extremely disappointed with it. Played it for 2 hours just to get up from the chair and wanting to punch into the wall with frustration. NOT ENJOYABLE. I, from now on, will be very CAREFUL in picking UBISOFT titles.GREAT GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT. SPEND YOUR MONEY ON A LATTE and you'll BE MORE SATISFIED."
3,It's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick...but not by much.,"This game is a lot like getting a really disappointing Christmas gift. On the outside it looks great; but when you open it up you're faced with a pink bunny costume.The positives: The game looks great and there's local and online multiplayerThe negatives: Annoyingly repetitive radio chatter from allies and enemies alike, crummy camera control, and the missions range from tedious to ""rip out your hair"" frustrating.Go find a copy of Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge; it's a heck of a lot more fun."
5,I liked it!,I liked this game. It was one that got a lot of play in my home. I think they are now on Blazing Angels 3 now.
3,Poor Seller,"Though the packaging shown on Amazon showed original packaging, the game disk showed up in a standard jewel case without the book and instructions."
5,NAOMI RAGEN DIDN'T LET ME DOWN,"I love Naomi Ragen's books, and The Ghost of Hannah Mendes was no exception. My only complaint is that I can't put her books down and then I have to wait to long until her next book is published. I am a Christian and I enjoy reading books that educate as well as entertain and I have enjoyed so much learning a little about Jewish culture and the different Jewish sects that Naomi Ragen has written about in her books. I throughly enjoyed The Ghost of Hannah Mendes."
3,Would have been better as JUST historical Fiction,"I would have liked more detail on HM 's life and the house of nasi. That's the story and it is a fascinating one. Since we do know enough about her I would have appreciated more information and what if scenarios about her life. The modern characters were typical, flat...I did, however, like the way they were jolted into spirituality by the ghosts of their ancestor!"
4,Intriguing,"Two sisters who are of Jewish faith loved their grandmother enough to do as she asked, to seek out the lost memoirs of their relative Hannah Mendez, lost due to the Spanish Inquisition and expulsion of the Jews from Spain. Even though it was a huge incovenience to both of them, they did so because of their devotion to her. But it was the coincidences and fate that brought them toward their goal. It was an intriguing story because of the way they went about it because the sisters were so different in personality and desires. However, their grandmother felt if they found the memoirs and Hannah's story was complete, it may bring true meaning to their lives."
2,Hot & Cold,"I couldn't put down the book during the historical sections. However, the transition the modern day themes did not ring true at all. Imagine, two young, enchantingly beautiful sisters falling in love with & two impossibly handsome, wealthy men. In all cases it's love at first sight, without exchanging more than a handful of sentences. Sorry, I prefer a bit more reality, even in my recreational literature. An OK read, but it's definitely on it's way to the second hand book store."
3,Historical Romance,"I really enjoyed the sentimentality felt throughout this book...The characters all seem to explore themselves and their humanity while their historical background brings them to to enchanting places all over europe... It was an education, a romance novel, a travel log and most of all entertaining and enjoyable..Read it, you won't be disappointed!"
3,historical romance,"One thing that I didn't know about this book, from the reviews, before I started, is that it is essentially (IMHO) a romance novel. And I don't really like romance novels. However I did enjoy this book because I learned alot about Sepharidim and the expulsion of Jews from Spain and then Portugal in the 15 century. And that part I really enjoyed.So if you like historical romance, this is probably for you. If you want to learn something about the Inquisition and don't mind reading a romance, this could also be interesting."
4,A thoughtful romance based on historical facts,"This book was a wonderful blend of romance and history. A story of one familie's history dating back to the 1400's and how their ancestor's sacrfices continue to play a part in the character's modern day lives. Although the book was sometimes difficult to follow due to jumping from 1400's characters to the present day characters , it still drew me in and made me anxious to find out more about the familie's deep history. The history lesson (which is based on true historical facts and a true family)intrigued me and peaked my interest in to the lives of the Jewish people who were forced to hide their faith for so long. Though, the love story was a little far fetched, I still found the book to be a very interesting and satisfying read."
2,More on Hannah Mendez,"Wow! I absolutely agree with the reviewer from Bala-Cynwyd, PA.This was a predictable romance novel, a page turner. Just as the previous reviewer mentioned, it does inspire one to read more on Hannah Mendes who must have truly been a fascinating character."
1,Ugh. A Harlequin Romace Dressed As An Histoical Novel,"The cover is beautiful! The title beguiling! I thought it would be a nice follow up to Anita Diamant's The Red Tent. Nothing could be furher from the truth. With the exception of the initial quote from the original manuscript by Hannah Mendes, the book is a florid, over written, content-free piece of fluff. Although it is a story of an ancient and wealthy family, I would actually prefer descriptions of things, other than expensive, shiny, lush, expensive, heirlom, expensive, gold and silver, rich, wealthy, and expensive. Bacon pretending to be kosher. Ugh."
5,A Rewarding Read!,"This book is confusing at first, but PLEASE give it a chance. It is a rich tale, set both in 15th century Spain and today. By the end, you will feel connected with the characters.Naomi Ragen is one of the best writers working today. While her writing is on Jewish themes, closer to her heart than mine, her storytelling is so well done that I cannot get enough of her books.Check out her other novels! You will not be disappointed. This is my first review for Amazon. But I feel so strongly about Ms. Ragen's books that I need to share them."
4,"Restore your belief in Love, Angels, Faith, & Divinity","Even though this book focuses on the Jewish religion, it really has appeal to all faiths who hold their teachings to their heart. As a member of the Catholic faith, I even felt acute religious awareness while reading it, because of the connection between faith, and family. I thoroughly enjoyed this story, and could not put it down after the first hundred pages. I would give it five stars except I felt that the author assumed the reader had too much knowlege of the Jewish faith and I wanted further explanation of some rituals."
3,the ghost of hannah mendes,"I expected a well written Jewish history novel like the books by Lion Feuchtwanger, instead I got a badly written love novel, were everything is very predictable from the beginning to the end. The heroin and historical figure of Hannah Mendeds stays fragmentory and if you have the slightest idea about sephardic jews, their history and their customs this book is not going add anything. The best this book did for me is getting me interested in Hannah Mendes and I'm going to read her biography by Cecil Roth next. One of the figures in the book, the dying grandmother reflects upon her life and how much time of her life she spend unwisely with many different things one of them being ""reading a false, poorly written but amusing book"". This is how I felt and I'm not even sure that the book was amusing giving its lack in creativity and literary style."
1,Review-Ghost of Hannah Mendes,"I have loved every other book by Naomi Ragen. But this book was justplain boring. What a total disappointment.Don't waste your timepurchasing this book. Purchase ""The Covenant"" or ""Sotah"" instead.They are absolutely riveting stories.You will not be disappointedwith these novels."
4,Use this book to get you up and running,"It doesn't matter whether you are a newcomer to Access or are upgrading - this book will get you up and running from page 1.It is easy to follow with lots of hints and tips. If you work through the book will you end up with an impressive database for a Video Shoe. You will have customers, videos, rentals etc so you can experience how a relational database works (one with linked tables).I am a trainer and wish I had written this series of books. I have found that anything with Joyce Cox in the Author list is good value.Buy this book first - when you have worked through it then consider buying an expensive ""all singing and dancing"" reference manual."
5,Another masterpiece from Northern England,"Oasis, The Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, The Smiths, Joy Division/New Order, The Buzzcocks, Gang of Four, The Charlatans UK, The La's. Any day now people will start writing doctoral dissertations about why the world's greatest rock bands have come from Manchester, Leeds, and Liverpool. Add to that list Magazine, perhaps the most criminally overlooked of all Manchester bands. ""The Correct Use of Soap"" is one sly, powerful left hook full of lyrical wordplay, frightfully intelligent arrangements, and stylish sentiment. If Nabokov had formed a rock band instead of writing novels, it might have sounded like this."
3,I don't quite see the genius...,"This album is pretty okay. Beyond that, I don't know what all the fuss is. I think Wire is a much better band. I think Pavement is better, Spoon is better and a lot of bands they get compared to are much better. I understand that Magazine was probably first to inspire the others, but they all manage to do it better, mainly because they don't get so melodramatic. The lyrics on CUOS are wishy-washy, bland and contrived. The instruments are so watered down and tinkly that it makes me feel like I'm listening to a soundtrack for a fairytale. People attempt to call this punk rock? I don't get it. What exactly is it that makes this so seminal? It's so basic that it's boring. And if that's the exact reason why it's supposed to be so stellar (it's stark minimalism) I think there is many bands and albums out there that do it better. I honestly think reviewers have to be a little bit more careful with their stars."
2,Not as advertised,Does not include the online code for online version. The content of the actual book is awesome. Not the online and print version though.
4,Read it for the ending,"This was a great book. The story was good, but the ending was very suspenseful. I recomend this book just for the ending.The story is that Tuppence and Tommy come across a painting of a house. Tuppence thinks she recognizes the house. It all results into a run-in with a child murderer. (the great ending)"
1,I did not enjoy this book because it was hard to understand.,I did not like this book because it was hard to understand and the plot was not very clear. The way they talked in the book was also hard to understand. You should also read other Agatha Christie books about Tommy and Tuppence before you read this one. It would help you understand it better. If you like complicated books then this is the one for you.
1,I did not enjoy this book because it was confusing.,"I did not enjoy this book because it was confusing and if you missed a single part of the book, then you were basically lost for the rest of the book. There were also too many characters with wierd life stories that weren't important until the very end. It was very complicated and hard to read."
4,The Japanese Chin: Dog from the Land of the Rising Sun,Excellent book on the history and breeding of Japaneses Chins. Good on all aspects of Chins. A must for Chin owners and breeders.
3,a bit fractured,The book takes bits and pieces of history and tries to put it together. Didn't think it was a great book about Chin's.
4,Chinese Character,The book is well organized and easy to read. The only neg I can think of is that it only talks about simplified characters and not traditional as well.
5,This second CD by Bennie Selvin is truly marvelous!!!!!,"....and you all thought Selvin's Volume I really was good...too...well.....this tops them all!!!!! Some of the biggest names recorded with Selvin: GOODMAN, MILLER, both JACK & CHARLIE TEAGARDEN, and even cowboy crooner SMITH BALLEW. Ballew has a singing voice like mine, and I have many, many of his records; including one recorded around 1932-1933 ""Tia Juna,"" and ""The Isle of Capri."" Selvin really had good potential and talent to show-off to the world what good quality musicians were really made of. (Bill Randle, if you're reading this -- don't forget, Selvin, in his whole career recorded under 150 different band-leading names, and way-over 9,000-10,000 recorded titles and I really don't care what jazz discographer Brian Rust thinks of my opinion.)"
2,"Ben Selvin,Vol.2","Ben Selvin had his first orchestra around 1917.He recorded over 3000 records for various companies.The bands featured on this CD Included many musicians who went on to fame;Benny Goodman,Tommy Dorsey,Artie Shaw,to name a few. The CD is a good review of the music heard in the '20's & '30's.but failed miserably in an attempt to""clean"" up whatever records they were dubbed from."
4,Great Buy,Easy to install and fliplock system seems durable enough to hold up. Much better than the button down types. Fit is good. Look is good. Removable back brace is easy. Only the corners of the fliplock system are of concern. They did not seem to fit into the channel like the sides. But they do fold down and it does not appear to be a problem.I strongly recommend.
3,Beware the Overt Generalities,"It's helpful that this story is from a child's point of view, but it does not excuse the generalizations. Use it as a reference - as social authentication - of multi-ethnic relationships, but it is a dated work that carries the overt stereotypes of the time. Dress, behaviors, and erroneous beliefs mark the story."
3,I thought it would focus more on the biracial child,"Don't mistake me, this is a great book if you want to learn about cultural differences. However, I feel that it is a bit outdated. I lived in Japan for 18 years -it was a bit insulting how the book suggested that Japanese people didn't know how to eat with forks and knives. Adding to that, I was under the impression that this book would focus more on the biracial child. It was a dissapointment because it didn't."
5,"Wise and muted, simple and understanding","The author of this Reading Rainbow Selection is wise; she knows how eating styles and habits can separate people and be inhibiting. The narrator recalls how her parents met: a white American sailor and a Japanese woman from the port city of Yokohama. The girl tells the reader that some days, in her house, they eat with chopsticks, and on some days with knives and forks. In the clear, muted watercolors, the reader finds her eating with chopsticks with a rice cooker on the first page, and eating with a knife and fork with a toaster on the last. Somewhat like O. Henry's story, The gift of the Magi, the sailor is too embarrassed to eat with Aiko, since he cant use chopsticks. And Aiko is frightened to eat with John, for she has never used a fork. But the port call is ending in a few weeks, so both rush to learn the other's ways, and an eating date is finally arranged. Love conquers all."
5,This is AWESOME!!!,"This is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is filled with action, has a great story line, and developes charactors really well. I would highly recomend it to anyone who is into hi-tech mysteries and internet stuff.Jeremy"
2,"Low quality, short life","Plastic is low quality, water tank cap broke after relatively short use, had to replace with something more sturdy. Also, water tank is enough for only one night in ""low"" setting and less than that in ""high"". The medicine cup is messy and not useful. Better to spend a bit more and get a decent humidifier if you plan to use this more than a few months."
4,If you like Italy then you will like her writing,"I read Ms. lee's story, Three, in The New Yorker and was blown away. This collection of short stories is 'interesting', but in small doses. By story that is. My suggestion would be to read one and then let the book sit. It conjures up images of worlds I saw in Italy."
4,"a chick lit book with more ""lit "" and less ""chick""","i read a review of this book over a year ago and i'm sorry i didn't read it sooner. this woman is a fantastic writer! her writing is so clear, concise, poetic. her characters, so finely drawn. i know these women...i am these women.andrea, where have you been?i have been to italy and i could see, smell and taste the places and experiences ms. lee was describing. i am also in an interracial relationship, and too, had to endure the looks, the whispering and ""set a few island women straight"" on trips to the carribbean. i understand that feeling of being everywhere and no where.i have read countless books in the last few years devoted to the female genre, or the ""chick lit ""market and have been gravely dissappointed to the point where i wanted the author themselves to give me my money back.ms. lee, my 22.95( canadian) is all yours!"
1,Self-indulgent,"The author needs to get over herself. In a world full of poverty and suffering, I found the author's insights boring and self-indulgent. I am amazed this book got published and sells. There must a lot of rich, middle class women with a lot time on their hands to buy and read this book."
4,A techno-house classic.,"If you enjoy the sounds of ""old-school"" techno/trance (think Superstition), you need to listen to this album. Pretty intense beats pound reletnlessly through this album, while layers of sythns build and build. The album is sequenced together, so the tunes kind of flow into one another.The best tracks on this album are Dreamchaser, Test Pilot, and People WIll Believe. Test pilot, in particular, is an unbelievable fusion of trance, techno, and house. I hate to say this, but there is one tune which should be avoided at all costs. Energy of Love pretty much reeks of cheese from its lame title, a la Pual Van Dyk / BT. This vocal tune is as bad as it gets. I've deducted a star from this near-perfect rating as a penalty!"
4,Warning: Spoiler!,"If you plan on reading this very entertaining book, please don't read the review from June 6, 2000. The ""Midwest Book Reviewer"" has included too much detail and will spoil your enjoyment of The Lion's Game."
3,Hey what happened?,"This was my first Nelson Demille read. It started out very strong & gripping. The whole sequence of events from the mysterious landing...scary stuff. I was even into the whole chase but I felt let down by the ending. It seemed like you were at the climax & he just gives you the short & sweet conclusion. I guess that's the setup for a sequel but I could've used some more meat & potatoes. Otherwise, a great read."
2,The Lion Sleeps Tonight,"This book reads like a non sweeps network movie of the week. We have our Alpha Male hero and post feminist heroine. Some misplaced sympathies with a terrorist whom we are invited to ""understand"" and a loosely wrought implication of government interagency conspiracy. The most interesting character in the book was the exKGB agent, Boris, with his astute observations on the American Character. The ending was Stephen King-like in its lack of satisfying resolution. If there is a sequel, I will consider checking it out of the library (maybe) just to see if The Lion gets it in the end. This one goes on the ""C"" shelf."
3,Demille at his worse!,"This book had a great start, a flight of dead people lands at JFK! Libyan terrorist at large! But from there on it goes downhill. Frankly I got sick of the main character, John Corey. His insults, ill temper and overbearing ego got extremely tiresome. If the terrorist had not been insane I would have pulled for him! The best writing in the book were the incidents with the terrorist. The book is too long and the ending was mushy. Wait for the paperback!"
1,"Don't Recommend Reading, Buying, Gifting or Borrowing","This is a hack book even by this genre's standards. The dialogue is laughably hardboiled, the characterizations are thin, and the finish is too clearly written for a sequel and has no sense of resolution. Some of the plotting is ok, but there is little to recommend this book when there are other fine books out there that deserve your attention."
3,DeMille fans should think twice about The Lion's Game,"A long-time fan of DeMille, I was disenchanted with his 2000 work ""The Lion's Game."" While Asad Khalil is an engaging villian, and John Corey's sarcasm and wit keeps the story light, this story pales in comparison to his other works. The story moves slowly and without much creativity. While it certainly is timely in its coverage of Mideast terrorism, it fails to weave the same intricate plot as DeMille did in, for example, ""The Gold Coast."" Without question, John Corey is no John Sutter! For DeMille fans, this, as all his books are, will be an interesting read. But I think you'll find yourself disappointed with the novel, ultimately thirsting for something more."
3,Letdown at the end,"As suggested by others this was a good page turner. Enjoyed it til I got to the end. At the end I almost felt like I did when I watched a made for TV movie that I didn't know had been a pilot for a never made series. They didn't logically end it and I felt I had really wasted 2 hours. I don't feel llike I wasted time reading this book, enjoyed it quite a lot til the end. Come on , Nelson, you really let us down. .Khalil could have been caught and you could have still brought the characters back in the next novel. There are several ways to get him back on the loose. As it is I fell I just finished part one and have no opportunity to finish part two. Also, btw, if you're going to detail driving down route 95, it does not take anywhere near an hour and 20 minutes to get from the Philadelphia airport to the Delaware border - more like 10-20 minutes and there is not one, let alone several rest areas in that stretch (at least going south) Sorry to be picky"
2,Rooked,"The opening gambit of this game is as exciting as any thriller in the recent past. An airliner in distress is about to land and the tension is so well drawn that you will not be able to stop until the first 125 pages are read. But then we are teased with action sequences alternated with transcripts of meetings with people we don't need to know. The author takes time to slap those movie critics who didn't like the film made from his earlier work and generally looses focus. At the end both major players walk away from the game and declare a draw. This is a work that needs an editor, who could have maintained the thrill of the opening."
2,Very Disappointing,"I'm a big Demille fan, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It starts off great and then spends 600 pages petering out to nothing. It is obviously a prequel to another book. It is also full of fluf. The book could be reduced by a couple of hundred pages, and an ending could be inserted. I won't even loan it to friends who are Demille fans."
2,"I was very, very disappointed...","I have read every book Nelson has written and have been a devoted fan. I couldn't wait to get my hands on his latest, ""The Lion's Den"". What a letdown! The plot plodded along. I hoped I would be rewarded toward the end but no dice. The action is mediocre at best and setting up for a sequel after a gazillion pages was a betrayal of his loyal readers. I won't be so eager for the next installment. If I do read it I'll wait and borrow someone's paperback copy."
4,Quit smoking with the Lion's Game,Needed something to totally occupy me the last week while I quit smoking. This book was the ticket. Couldn't put it down until I was finished. Great suspense and humor. DeMille is one of my favorite authors. I was let down with the ending though. I thought it kind of fizzeled.
5,A reader from California,What a wonderful read. I love the John Corey character - you feel like you want to get to know him personally. Very witty dialogue. Great development of characters and story line. Can't wait for the next DeMille book.
5,John Corey is BACK!,I have been waiting for this ever since i finished Plum Island. It has been well worth the wait. It is great to see John Corey back in action making wise cracks and dodging bullets. Any fan of Nelson DeMille should read this book. I particulary liked his references to his other books and even going far as mentioning the GENERALS DAUGHTER movie which i loved. I must read!
5,demille typically brilliant,"You gotta love John Corey.This book should permanently stay on your shelf as sort of an encyclopedia of comeback wisecracks.Just as good as Plum Island. One of the greatest scenes of all time is when Corey is on the phone with Asad during their ""negotiations."" Long live Demille.He's the man when you're on a vacation and all you want to do is relax in the sun."
3,It lost my interest by page 100,This was really interesting in the beginning but then he just started going on and on for at least 100 pgs about his relationship. I skipped many pages and then the ending was just ok - nothing spectacular. The Gold Coast was a much better book.
2,Too long and too weak,"You can almost hear the publisher screaming at Demille to finish this book... which he does, quickly, giving a weak and disappointing cop-out of an ending. Then the editor left in at least 100 pages of rambling character description that served to bore rather than excite. This book equates to the last meaningless chapters of Plum Island that were far fetched and wordy. Only the occasionally clever dialog earns two stars.Read Gold Coast, but leave this one on the shelf."
2,Far below Demille quality standards,"Being Demille among my favorite authors I am really disappointed with this novel. Flat, too long, with a lousy start and a lousy end, no suspense and a trivial content, he made a bad job out of a very good idea, leaving you at the last page with the sense that you read a lot and could not get anything in exchange. Bad for the humorous John Corey who plays the role of a clown instead of a cop all the time distorting the sense and realism of the tale and good for the credible bad guy, Asad Khalil who was involved in situations which could have been exploited with more action packed suspense for the benefit of the reader but weren't. Demille is a very good writer, if you are looking for a Demille good one, go for The Gold Coast or Word of Honor and skip this one"
3,"Good reading, but...","This was a huge book -- weighing in at 674 pages (looks like DeMille got paid per page). Unfortunately, the content did not quite do justice to the weight. It is readable, no doubt. John Corey, DeMille's character from his other book (Plum Island), makes a reappearance and is quick witted, saracstic, and politically uncorrect as usual. But this time, the book does not have the quick pace to the story as DeMille's previous books like The Ivory Coast, Spenserville, and General's Daughter had. DeMille takes forever to develop the story and sketch out the character of the antagonist, only to let the reader down at the end. The ending only makes sense if DeMille wants to resurrect the antagonist in another book sometimes in the near future."
3,"Expected to be ""wowed"" -Demille delivers a lack-luster story","Like many Nelson Demille fans, I waited eagerly for his newest release. Simply stated, it's a good read but not up to his prior works.As others have noted, the story line is inconsistent: first a page-turning introduction, and then a tedious mid section. Just as the book picks up with interest again towards the end, Demille seems to lose focus and concludes with a weak and disappointing ending.Yes, Demille is a master at writing interesting characters, and he does find humor even in the midst of international terrorism -- but, Nelson, why the lack-luster finish? Some hope for a sequel, I was just hoping for a repeat of the enjoyable experience I had with some of your prior works.Here's hoping the next Demille tome stays consistently exciting from cover to cover."
1,what happened to Demille here?,"I have absolutely loved every book he ever wrote so I automatically bought Lion's Game and was I ever disappointed. Even so I am looking forward to the next book,I'm keeping the faith ol' boy.. Eileen"
4,It's a book (sorry- had to put in a title),"This was the first DeMille book I've read. The first half of the book was not only well written, but it made me think. I travel internationally a lot, and as DeMille pointed out, the ease of which a terrorist could attack it frightening. The last half of the book could have been cut down substantially (all those incescent trips to Federal Plaza and various FBI offices, for instance.) I really enjoyed the character of John Corey. His wit and sarcasm are the kind of thing I like to see in lead characters."
4,"Fun, Enjoyable Thriller...","This is my third book by Nelson DeMille. HATED General's Daughter, LOVED Plum Island. Loved this book too. John Corey, the hero is really funny. The plot was interesting, I liked the way the chapters alternated between the hero and the villian's point of view.I guessed at the ending and was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. Course it screams ""Sequel"" at you but after this book I'd buy it right away. Pretty funny too the way the author slams a couple of reviewers who badly reviewed his ""General's Daughter"" movie.If you like thrillers, definitely check this one out! I can't wait to find out what John Corey does next."
5,Great!,"I could not put this book down! I had resisted reading Nelson Demille for years until last summer when, on vacation by the pool, I FINALLY picked up the Gen's Daugh...after that I read every book I could find....Lion's Game was one of the best...GREAT characters and character development, and interesting story...and the best sarcastic humor! I love that he refers to at least three other books and a movie...Very entertaining! Can't wait for the next one...Write faster Mr. Demille!"
2,Very Disappointing,"I always look forward to a Demille novel, this book however was a big disappointment. The story starts out as a terrific thriller but quickly loses its momentum, becoming tedious as the story plays out. My biggest complaints were the totally unsatisfying characterizations of the detectives on the case. John Corey was fun as the wise-cracking protagonist of Plum Island. Here, the wisecracks ring hollow. No one could maintain a wisecracking demeanor faced with the multiple deaths presented in this novel. The ending was rushed and unsatisfying. A sequel to this bomb we really don't need. Readers have come to expect more from Mr. Demille."
4,A New Demille Fan,"""The Lion's Game"" was the first of Demille's books for me. Now that I've enjoyed this realistic and entertaining novel, I plan on reading the rest of his works."
1,What is up with the price?,I have not yet read this book but am curious what is going on with Amazon? I bought my Kindle in May and it is amazing the speed with which they are raising book prices. $12.99 for a 10 year old book? That is crazy. I could get one for $2 at the second hand store but will pay a little more to have it on the Kindle because I prefer to read that way. This price difference is out of hand though.
1,GREEDY,I will never pay that much money to read a 10 yr. old book on my Kindle. GREEDY. The only reason I gave it one star is because I had too
2,Anyway,"I can't tell you how many paragraphs DeMille starts with the word, ""Anyway..."" This signifies that he has gone off on a tangent during which John Corey issues his ""witticisms"" that are at most annoying and at worst, painful.Let's face it, Mr. DeMille, you are not funny and you should give up trying to force your attempts at humor on the reader.The other huge problem with this book is that it's about 250 pages short of War and Peace, a much more interesting novel, by a superior author.The beginning of the book promised so much more but now we are bogged down in the minute detail of federal law enforcement bureaucracy.It's a wonder the feds catch anyone. And yet they do, giving me pause to question the accuracy of DeMille's opinions of our law enforcement community.I've enjoyed several of Mr. Demille's books. This wasn't one of them."
2,Not much of a story,"I read this book on the advice of reviews advertising a great story, only to be very disappointed. The book is twice as long as it should be for the story it tells. Page after page of small talk between characters fill in between real plot elements. DeMille has created a believable story, but I had a hard time finishing the book because it was a tedious read. I won't say don't read it, but there's much better out there."
4,Good read!,Let's put it this way. I anxiously read this book in two days. I immediately ordered the next in the series. It is entertaining and an engaging read.
3,Wordy,"At times it goes on & on about nothing. I did then start reading his Gold Coast novel. Again very wordy. Much said about nothing,"
3,Entertaining But Certainly Not TheGold Coast or Charm School,"The Gold Coast made me laugh out loud, The Charm School gripped my interest, Plum Island and The General's Daughter were fun reads but after an engrossing start this book ended as a disappointment. As in The Charm School, DeMille forces the reader to reflect on the perceptions of American culture from the outside. I found the characters amusing but at times the text was too long. The ending seemed to focus more on the set up for a sequel than the book at hand. Nevertheless, if you enjoy DeMille's sense of humor as much as I do, go for it. Keep in mind that this book does not live up to the ones that preceded it."
3,"Good story, annoying writing style","The only thing more annoying than the main character, John Corey, trying to be funny ALL the time, was the fact it was written in first-person through him. It seemed as though the author was trying to live his dream of being a comedian through this character. The following paragraphs were then always started with ""Anyway,"" - even more annoying, but I'll blame that on a poor editor. It's a good story if the little things don't get to you. It's especially chilling and educational because of 9/11."
4,"Good, but not as good as earlier works","This was one of the largest and most interesting books that I have read in ages. It was fast paced enough to keep you from putting the book down and the writing as expected, was clever and witty. The only problem I found with the book- that I've been realizing more and more lately- is that Mr. Demille can right a great novel, but just can not end it properly. I was once again disappointed with the ending, and agree with another reader that it seemed to have been emphasizing a sequel more than anything else. Nevertheless, it will turn out to be a great novel for summer reading."
2,apology,Mr.Nelson Demille owes me an apolgy for having me read 677 pages of a book that has no closure. e-mail PIMel@aol.com Mr.I. Melamed
3,Comments on The Lion's Game,"I was disappointed with The Lion's Game because although witty in places, it isn't up to Plum Island -- one of my favorite books."
4,"worth reading, but not his best!","As a stranded traveler on the east coast during the blizzard of 00', I was glad that I had this book to keep me company. I am a huge DeMille fan and love his wit and suspense. This book was a page turner and fun to read, but predictable and I felt not fully developed. I found the middle section of the book overly detailed about information that did not pertain to the plot and would have rather read more dialogue between the main characters. I was also a bit disappointed by the ending. I say all of this as a critical DeMille reader, as I did not think that it was as good as the Gold Coast or the Charm School. All of this being said, it is certainly an entertaining book and enjoyable to read."
4,Lion's game,"This book was very good, but it was not quite flawless. As a couple other people have commented, the middle pages do tend to drag a little bit; also, I didn't find the ending especially satisfying, but Demille's books always have strange endings, so I can't be too surprised. Overall, however, this was classic DeMille--I thought that it was funnier than Plum Island, and (at least in stretches) almost as funny as Gold Coast. For the record, I would rank DeMille's books: 1. Gold Coast (the best modern novel I have ever read) 2. Charm School 3. Lion's Game 4. Word of Honor 5. General's daughter 6. Cathedral 7. Spencerville (what happened?). #2 - #6 were all very good, just no Gold Coast, and #7 was the only blacksheep."
2,It read more like a text book!,"I love most Nelson Demille books but this one felt like he needed a lot of filler between the action. Sure it gives a lot of insight to the mind of a terrorist but there are a lot of words between the action.I was disappointed. I felt like I was reading a Tom Clancy novel and felt there were way to many facts that did little to help the plot and for most of the book I would skip pages hoping I could return to the plot.I kept thinking, ""OK, get on with it"".Plum Island is WAY WAY better."
2,Just missed,"This could have been an excellent book. Dialogue was wonderful. The first 150 pages started out fast-paced making it hard to put down. The bad guy was awesome!! The pace slowed. Then it virtually stopped. And to top it off, there wasn't a conclusion. Too bad!When reading a book that relies completely on the plot, the pace has to be at a break neck speed. There is no room to stop the story to develop a weak romance and characters who are fleeting to begin with. And setting up for a sequel does nothing more than irritate me and makes me feel as if my time was wasted in reading the book.I won't be buying the sequel...or any other DeMille books."
2,Definitely not his best work.....slow read.,I usually read right through DeMille's books in one sitting but this one took me 2 weeks because the pace would pick up then it would SLOW>>>>>>>down and be soooo boring and then pick up a little again and slow down yet again. I had to force myself to finish the book and in the end was left with an overall disappointed feeling about Demille's latest effort. Hopefully the next one will be as good as he usually writes. If you are a first time Demille reader and found this book boring...go back and read some of his earlier works like The Charm School and Plum Island and my favorite Spencerville.
2,Great Start - Feeble Conclusion,Demille has been consistently one of my favorite authors - hitting memorable highs with Gold Coast and Plum Island. With Lions Game he has gone from boom to bust. The thrilling and imaginative beginning gradually unravels to an imcomprehensible conclusion. What is all this John and Kate nonsense - ending up at the altar after Kate more or less extracts (molar like) a proposal from our courageous hero? What is with the Lion disappearing in the end - are we being primed for a sequel? What is with the sale of character names to charity? After reading this book I feel less like a happy satisfied reader than grist for some marketing mill with an unknown agenda. Demille - find your pace again or you will start losing loyal readers!!
2,"What? I'm sorry, were you intending to write a novel, here?","I have read everything by DeMille and with the exception of this book, they were all novels. This one seems to be a rough draft of an idea, thrown together with a character from a previous story to gain reader interest.Well written, certainly. Interesting, no."
3,The Lion's Game,"Good follow-up the the previous book (Plumb Island) However Demille for whatever reason decided that the previous book lacked in descriptive sex scenes (which it did not) so he added more, which is a disappointment to me. I liked the story, it was easy to read but the plot was not advanced by the lurid sex."
3,Good Enough,"The Lion's Game is good enough to be the sequel to The Lion, but is somewhat predictable. It is nowhere near the quality nor the storytelling as The Lion."
2,"926 Pages, Really?","There's a decent 300-page beach read in there somewhere. Trouble is, you'll have to wade through 926 pages to find it. Spoiler alert, the US Government is a screwed-up bureaucracy. There, I just saved you 400 pages, most of which are dedicated to our hero (John Corey - of Plum Island fame) whining about that fact. Double spoiler alert, after slogging through chapter after chapter of the bad guy's every waking thought and movement, the whole thing was nothing more than a set up to a sequel."
5,Get hooked on DeMille,I love Nelson DeMille's books. John Corey is a great character. Read this before Plumb Island and got hooked on his books.
3,It's worth a read,"This book, The Lion's Game, falls under the same category as most of Stephen King's work - not serious literature but enjoyable stuff, a so-called ""page-turner"". The thing was huge, almost 1,000 pages, but it was quick read. It was a suspenseful tale about a Libyan terrorist coming to the United States for pay back to the Libyan air raid in 1986. It was published before September 11th, 2001; I'm not certain how well novels about terrorists would sell today, since it has become clear it's more than just a fun read. The ending, I'll say, is disappointing."
4,John Corey does it again!,"I fell in love with the character of John Corey. On the recommendation of a friend, I was told to read ""Palm Island"" first. I'm glad I did as it gave me a lot of background on John and a huge part of his motivation for his life in the ""Lion's Game"". I was totally involved from beginning to end."
3,Not Nelson's best work,"Not up to Demille's usual lofty standards. This book is about 100 pages too long and doesn't satisfy you at the end. Nelson gets a little carried away with the details in this one, and also lets the main character (John Corey) get a little too slapstick. Still worth reading, but if you've never read Demille before, start with one of his better novels like The Gold Coast, The Charm School, or The General's Daughter (the book's way better than the movie)."
2,Not as good as his others,"I am still reading this book and must say aside from the humour I was quite disappointed especially I thoroughly enjoyed The Charm School, this is a bit of a let down. I liked Plum Island and General's Daughter. Shall give him another try."
2,Garbage transformed into words,"He bears a striking resemblance to my eleven year-old cousin, except DeMille carries a 'good' plot--'good' deserved in comparison to those of my cousin. For a main character who was addicted to revenge, it seemed like he was just addicted to killing; and Corey, addicted not to stop crime but sex. I can make a concession: the ladder's plausible. I respect him for his audacity: a parody on terrorism. And he did make me laugh, but I need more from 900-pages printed on onion skin. After finishing, I looked on the front to see ""best-selling author."" I rushed immediately to my computer: I've never felt so optimistic in my life."
4,Fun and well written but he has done better.,"Well, with The Lion's Game DeMille has created the Assassin for the ages. Pretty nasty fellow. The main character is John Corey, a former New York City cop working with the Feds trying to apprehend this super terrorist. The book is well written and at moments shines with great dialogue and very funny observations about the politics of inter agency relationships. Corey's love interest, and partner, is fine but I fail to understand the hurry with the relationship. The secondary characters are sharply written and original but the novel lacks the multi-layered complexities of his earlier work. Don't get me wrong, this is a worthwhile read but do not expect another Gold Coast."
4,John Correy is why I read these books,"Action, Correy's humor, and characters that are very real in this modern age. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in intrique with a twist."
5,JOHN COREY ** BOOK TWO,"Nelson DeMille gives us the second book in the John Corey series, THE LION'S GAME. Fours and and half stars, a little long winded sometimes, but that said a good exciting book two to the series. In PLUM ISLAND we met the detective John Corey, NYPD homicide, who is funny, barbed tongued and oh, an excellent investigator. He was forced to retire(did you read book one?) and now is out of retirement recruited in to the ATTF, the Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force, a group that crosses agencies with CIA, FBI. NYPD, ATF and what ever it takes. This novel starts with such a bang as a plane lands in NYC with everyone on board dead and there the chase begins to find ""The Lion."" This is a good story and very good second book in a series, a good police procedural and good series to read. On to book three, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, book and series. Somehow I see Bruce Willis playing John Corey."
4,I would have given it five stars if it had a real ending.,"I confess that I am a bit in love with John Corey. He is so funny, so smart and so sexy. I laughed out loud several times, which can be embarrasing because I do most of my reading on a commuter train. This book is at times terrifying and gorey and other times absolutely hilarious. (John Corey's ability to come up with about ten different insulting names for one of Kate's former boyfriends was priceless.) Nelson DeMille is wonderful. I just wish the ending had not been so up in the air. It is clear there will be a sequel, which is great, but I still feel some loose ends could have been tied up."
1,very disappointed,"The first half of the book is excellent. It really makes you think about the ease in which a terrorist attack could take place in the US. It also has some really interesting insights into Middle Eastern terrorism. However, halfway through the book it was as if some other author stepped in and decided to finish the book. There was no longer any suspense; however, the author continued to go on and on as though there was a great surprise at the end of the book... The main character, John Corey, is a clever, humorous man who turns into a complete idiot... I could have thought of a million good endings to this book, but unfortunately the author couldn't."
1,Johnny we hardly knew ye.,"What the hell happened? The witty and charismatic hero of Plum Island has turned into a misogynist bore. As a long time Demille fan [I count Plum Island, General's Daughter, and The Charm School as must reads in this genre] I am afraid he has missed the mark here. This is a long, boring ride to nowhere. The villain was particularly tiresome in this book [though I'll have to try the soda bottle silencer trick] and the sequel portending end was disappointing. I hope this was just a speedbump for Demille and the follow up will be stronger. I would hate to see him go the way of Clancy, Ludlum or Grisham."
3,"Very entertaining, John Corey is great, but...","the ending (or should I say non-ending) was very disappointing. (Stop reading here if you don't want part of the plot given away) I understand that the author wants to do a sequel, but there was all this buildup to a 'showdown' between the terrorist, Kalil, and John Corey, but instead the reader is left hanging as the terrorist gets away scot-free. Also, I felt the relationship between Corey and Kate Mayfield was very rushed. He sleeps with her once, then they're planning on getting married? Seemed out of character for Corey. The ending of his relationship with Beth Penrose was handled very poorly as well. Despite the flaws though, it was an enjoyable read. Of course, Corey's humor was the saving grace here, and made the book worth reading, but this did not live up to it's predecessor, Plum Island."
1,BORING,"Read The Gold Coast or Charm School but whatever you do, don't read this book. This book is boring and long, not a good combination. Demille is a great writer but his work is getting worse. He needs to read The Gold Coast again and figure out how he did it."
2,Terrible ending,"This book was enjoyable (although too lengthy by half) right up until the ending. Or should I say lack of an ending? The fact that all major storylines are left unresolved makes this read a colossal waste of time. I personally spoke to the author on 2-12-00 and was informed that there would be no sequel. Therefore, 2 stars is a generous review."
1,The book's popularity is a sad commentary about its readers,"With this book, Demille seems to be following in the steps of Jack Higgins and Robert Parker in losing the skill to write a well plotted book with interesting characters. There seems to be a pattern followed by these authors. They produce best sellers at the top of their writing careers and then lose their story telling skills but continue to produce books merely for the sake of having a publisher trade on their past books. They remind me of the sad cases of professional atheletes who have lost their past skills, but persist in continuing to play as poor imitations of themselves in their better days. If Demille cannot to do better at this point than produce this sort of story with gratuitous and unneccesary violence amid too many pages of background with unreal and uninteresting characters then he should gracefully retire. The real sad commentary is that many readers think this sort of book is ""great"" or contains a ""compelling plot."""
3,The Lions Game,"This was my first experience with this author. I wouldn't seek out any of his other works as this novel was slow, plodding, and unsatisfying."
1,Not up to DeMille standards,"DeMille has written many fine suspensful novels, including Charm School, Cathedral and others. The Lions Game is one similar chapter after another that if all lumped together would produce a giant Cookie. It is far from being his best book."
2,Where's the ending?,I enjoyed The Lion's Game until the final chapter (or lack of afinal chapter!). Demille must be thinking sequel. I expected more fromhim.
2,"In my opinion, a waste of time, money & good paper.","This is perhaps the fourth Nelson Demille book I've read, & it's by far my least favorite. I thought it moved very slowly, that it was predictable, and that the ending was very unsatisfying. Demille develops a romance between two of the main characters that can only be described as infantile. John Corey makes a very likeable ""bad boy"" hero, but that's the only saving grace of this book."
2,Another predictable thriller,"Nelson Demille disappoints his readers in many ways. We expect a great plot, interesting characters, and great humour. We get a decent plot, although this one has a weaker ending than Plum Island or The Gold Coast, both of which have somewhat less than ripping endings. We get John Corey, whom we already know, and he is predictable, as always. We get Asad Khalil, a character whose relationship with Corey is pretty hard to believe. The book keeps a reader going, but at the end leaves a sour taste."
5,Breathtaking,"It's often easy to forget that the word ""breath-taking"" literally means to take one's breath away. That's what happened to me with THE LION'S GAME: author Nelson DeMille made his story so exciting that I would find myself holding my breath.DeMille long has been one of my favorite authors. When he wrote PLUM ISLAND, the predecessor of THE LION'S GAME, I had thought that he never would exceed that accomplishment. And along comes THE LION'S GAME--and DeMille exceeded PLUM ISLAND. Incredible!DeMille always has been an author of great imagination and gifted story-telling skills. What sets him ahead of the pack is his impeccable research and attention to details. The details he is careful to provide not only make his plots plausible; the details also make his mysteries fascinating.THE LION'S GAME may remain the best suspense thriller I ever read...unless DeMille writes its sequel and again outdoes himself."
3,An OK Book,"This book was not up to this author's usual standards in my personal opinion. Nelson usually writes ""edge-of-your-seat"" suspense but this book didn't do that for me. I find it rather predictable. I like John Corey, and find him believable, but the heroine was less so, and their relationship seemed somewhat stilted. I also didn't feel like we the reader got inside the head of the Lion like most good thrillers put us. A bit of a disappointment."
1,WAY too long and repetitive,"Started out well, but this was the first DeMille book I really did NOT enjoy. It was much too long, and went on and on, repeating over and over the same scenarios you just went through in the chapter before. And the terrorist they were chasing and chasing throughout this long drawn out waste of time, GOT AWAY in the end and you never even know what happened to him. It was such a let down from other books I had read by DeMille. And the so called romance interest was like fingernails on a chalkboard. Once I was finished, this one got tossed in the recycle bin. I wouldn't bore any of my bookworm friends with this long dull tale."
3,The roar ended with a meow,"This was my second DeMille book, the first being Plum Island. Lion started out with a roar, and ended with a wha? Demille also feels it is necessary to fill our heads with an endless array of unimportant mundane facts. The ending left me saying I read 685 pages for this? Very disappointing to what could have been a very exciting book."
3,Great Game for Fast Paced Reading!,"The Lions Game is a fast paced and fun book to read! Demille has a sense of humor that shines through from start to finish without detracting from the action. Khalil makes a nemisis that one loves to hate. His cunning and plans serve as a wake up call for any real counter terror agencies. The story is fairly straight forward and is a great book for fun. Don't think this novel will make it to many 'reread' piles, but it is still worth the time it takes to finish the first time around. Some of the jokes in this book are classic. I want to tell one, but that would be spoiling too much. You'll have to read it for yourself."
1,A DeMille Letdown,"DeMille's weakest book, slow moving at times and the ending is horrible(I won't reveal the ending because there isn't one). I couldn't shake the feeling that DeMille was writing for the movies rather than just letting his prodigious talent flow. First-time DeMille readers would be wise to start with The Gold Coast or Word of Honor, two absolute gems that demonstrate what DeMille is capable of writing."
3,"Unfortuanately, The Lion's Game was not worth the wait","First things first, I am a HUGE Nelson DeMille fan. He is the only author whose catalog I have read entirely (granted he only has 11? novels), and I have found almost all of his books to be intriguing and hard to put down. The Lion's Game, however, fell far short of what I was expecting. The plot started of fiercely but after the opening chapters took on a predictable, unimaginatively contrived sequence of events. I have come to expect shocking plot twists from DeMille, and the ""twists"" in this plot (or lack there of) were very disappointing. The humor of John Corey is by itself reason enough to read this book, but if you are looking for a plot that matches the suspense of DeMille's Charm School, Gold Coast, and General's Daughter, then you will be as sorely disappointed as I."
5,Great book!,I couldn't put this book down. Although it's a long story..every page was great! can hardly wait for the next one!
3,"The Lion Turns into a ""Editor Wants a Sequel""","The book was very absorbing. I did read it in two days so I was quite entertained. However, this ending left me out in the cold, waiting for the real ending. It's fairly obvious that Mr. DeMille's editors talked him into writing a ""cliff-hanger"" ending, waiting for the real ending in the sequel to come. I was very disappointed because I loved ""Plum Island"" and ""The General's Daughter,"" both of which ended very satisfactorily; in that they had endings which were obviously endings. The characters were generally multi-dimensional and spoke believable dialogue. I'm sorry, but the ending just wasn't one this time."
1,very poor ending,"I spent a lot of time reading this book and enjoying it up until the end. How can there not be a sequal? Did the author just get tired and take the easy way out? A decent ending could have taken an additional 60 pages, He could have increased the price of the book with the additional pages. I enjoyed all his other books. Don't buy this book/ rent it from the library!"
1,Not sure what's up with Nelson DeMille,"If this were the first Nelson DeMille book I'd read, I'd read no more...I loved his character John Corey in other books, but this time he was just creepy. His wisecracking got old fast and for the most part, it was juvenile. Wisecracking is supposed to be a part of the character, but in this book, it was over the top. He's supposed to be a very smart cop/whatever, but in this book he was just childish and annoying."
2,"Silly at times, and a terrible ending!","The Lions Game was mostly not a bad read. Many things were beyond belief/silly, and there were an enormous number of ""stupid"" people in it, but, I still read on.....and for that, I am sorry! The ending was simply terrible. Ok, maybe he wants to write a sequel, but give us a break: We're reading it NOW, and would like it to have SOME ending!I can't possibly recommend this book to anyone. It will just frustrate you!"
3,The ending that wasn't,"Intriguing for about the first 300 or so pages, but then predictable and downhill from there. It seemed as if the author became bored with the story and just decided to end it...right then and there. No big climax, no wrapping up the story.John Corey's relationship with Kate Mayfield completely opposes his character's personality. Mr. tough cop, prejudiced bad guy killer turned into cheesy romantic. It just didn't work.This is my first Demille, and I did like his style enough to pick up some of his other books. I just think he missed the homerun with this one."
2,The Lion had no bite,"First of all, this is the most verbose book I have ever read. It could have definitely been written in 500 pages or less.The character of Kate Mayfield was woefully underdeveloped and one dimensional. She is either quoting FBI scripture or trying to get laid.While the characters of Asad Khalil and John Corey were well developed and entertaining, there was a lack of interplay between the two characters. While Khalil was carrying out his mission, Corey was pondering relationship problems. It was like reading two books and the interaction between the two characters was coincidental.Lastly, the ending was a big question mark and resolved nothing except for the status of Mayfield and Corey's relationship. Maybe the author should start writing romance novels like Danielle Steele :-\"
3,Lion's Game will keep you reading...,"Nelson DeMille grew on me - I am now a devote of John Cory and his sour, sarcastic attitude. I've read Plum Island 1st (of course I didn't read them in order) & enjoyed that one as well. Not that anyone needs to be told that the government may have a few conspiracies going - but it's interesting to be given some insight into how the different governmental organizations interact & how a terrorist crisis maybe handled. Can Nelson write one on the Katrina mess now? I'd like some additional insight into just how that one was bungled!The reason for 3 stars vs. 4 is that I was able to guess the ending early on - still fun to read."
2,Should be shorter,"Lion's Game is a well-constructed novel that could have been trimmed by a couple of hundred pages and been a better read. It takes until well over half the book before someone finally gets on the terrorist's track and the chase begins. Until then, you are bogged down in too many meetings and a lot of talk, no action. The author should have more respect for the reader. If he wants to write this many pages, he should make the story less stale for so much of the book. The only one generating action is Khalil when he is toying with his victims. The other characters sit around too long with their fingers up their you-know-whats."
3,A little better than run-of-demille,"You'd be hard pressed to find a better or more intriguingopening 75 pages than the ones DeMille has crafted in ""The Lion'sGame."" A jet lands from Paris and everybody is dead. Okay. I'm hooked. How'd it happen? Who's responsible? And how are they going to catch him? The overly cornball Corey humor and his overwritten conflicts with the FBI tend to hamper the Corey chapters. And his romance with a female FBI agent strains plausibility. But, the narrative pull is strong. And the Corey-esque humor that worked put a smile on my face. I'll sign on -- reluctantly -- for the sequel. END"
2,The Lion's Game,"The least satisfying Demille book I've read. You don't do nearly 700 pages and set up a sequel with an unresolved ending. As for the sequel, who cares? Demille is now writing for his own entertainment, not ours. On to someone else, like Donald Westlake."
3,"Great Story, Horrible Ending.","I bought this book when it first came out in paperback and finally picked it up this year. This massive book (just under 1000 pages) led me to believe I was going to be reading this for a while. Not the case. The book flew by in less than 3 days. The main character John Corey and provides some punchlines and humor while his femme fatale partner provides the sexual tension. The ""bad guy"" Asad Khalil is a masterful planner which made myself believe that the guy was crazy and had an obsessive compulsive disorder. The many chapters switch between Corey's first person view on the incidents and Khalil's expeditions in the third person. The book is a 5 star effort from DeMille until the last 20 pages. It is all downhill from there. I would recommend this book to anyone but with a warning, actually a demand, that they skip the last 20 pages, for their opinions of this book will be soured."
4,Love American Style,"Almost intense as real life, which is saying a lot considering the intenseness of current events. Rapid and plot-driven with John Corey's usual annoying-but-you-can't-help-but-like-him-because-he's-usually-right sense of humor as highlights. I could do w/o the 2000 version of the Mayfield/Corey = Hepburn/Tracey plotline, but then, hey, I'm a woman. I guess men enjoy that slurpy stuff. Looking forward to what's next for Corey and can only hope that Mayfield dies because John's so much more entertaining when he's miserable."
5,The Lion,Love DeMille - everything he writes is intriguing and holds my interest. What I love best is he makes me laugh!
3,"A Good Read, But Not the Best DeMille I've Read","This is the third or fourth DeMille book I've read - although it's been a while since I finished one. Based on The Charm School and Plum Island, I expected The Lion's Game to be as extraordinary. It was definitely good, but not extraordinary.Throughout the book, I was intrigued by the mind of the assassin, but John and Kate seemed too predictable. And, as other reviews have said, the ending was a bit contrived.On the other hand, DeMille has tempted me to read The Lion - - - so it's on my list to read soon!"
4,Research Required,"I enjoyed this book very much. Good action, good story and good pace. BUT, as usual, when it comes to air traffic control, it needed more research. When an aircraft loses its radio its called a NORDO aircraft. Meaning it has no rdo(the abbreviation for radio in atc). The whole accident procedure when the aircraft landed was also erred. Research is what this novel lacks and that is why people in the field of aviation and air traffic should read this with a grain of salt."
2,"An abberation, I hope","A major dissappointment. Loved C athedral, Charm School, Gold Coast, Plum Island and General's Daughter. Hope this is an abberation. The book is much too long. Bored with the protagonists after a while. Plot is too predictable. Hope he returns to the tight plotting that characterized his previous works. Looking forward to the next one; but wished I passed this one by."
3,long,I was 1/2 way thru it when my luggage containing my kindle was lost on Southwest. did find it a little long
3,Entertaining but long,"The book took a long time to unfold. It took 8 chapters to get to the startling event that was splashed all over the book's jacket. And the main character,John Corey, is an infuriating misogynist. So why the 3 star rating? There was something about the book that just pulled me along. I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. And John started to grow on me. It was a pleasant diversion."
5,The Lion's Game,"Nelson DeMille clearly displays in this book the concept that we fear what we don't understand, especially religion and culture's quest for God. All around the world, the Khalils and the Coreys, et al., have been loving and worshipping God, while hating and murdering each other. For those who weren't satisfied with the ending, maybe the fact that both Asad Khalil and John Corey were still alive on the last page was a small spark of hope for the future... from an author who's life experiences prompt him to desire a world where the Lion and the Lamb sleep peacefully together. END"
3,Where is the ending???,"I like the characters, the banter, the plot and the structure of the novel, but I would never have guessed that it did not have an ending. There were numerous ""plugs"" for his previous books, ""Plum Island"" and the ""Charm School"", which is forgivable because the reader (me) was having a good time. However, if this 600+ page book was only a set up for a future book, I will be sure not to read it. Why would Nelson be dishonest with his readers??"
1,800 pages were at least 400 to many,Extremely boring - you know what is going to happen from almost the very beginning: no unexpected twists and turns. Endless descriptions of minor details. A big disappointment
5,Need to read Demilles books with Corey in order,"Demille did it again. A great page turner. Unfortunately I read the books out of order. Should read Plum Island first, then Lions Game, Night Fall, and his latest Wild Fire. If you like a character who is sarcastic and against the beurocracy then the series is for you."
3,Great characters - weak ending,"I loved this book - all but the last 10% of it. I think the John Correy character is great, and the chemistry with Kate Mayfield works pretty well at both the professional and personal level. My previous critique on Demille books is that the male and female romance seems forced. It is not so in this story.The antagonist character is brilliant and truly engaging. I really think well of how this character was developed, portrayed, and evolved. The banter between the antagonist and protagonist could have been bolstered though, but perhaps that was just a side-effect of how much I enjoyed both characters.I'm not sure how I feel about the switching of writing styles from the 1st and 3rd person. I guess by the end, I was ok with it, but it was something that put me off guard (as it usually does) for the first chapter or so.All in all, good book that could have been excellent if the ending was improved (no spoilers here)."
5,DeMille's done it again!,"A modern day thriller, full of suspense. John Corey successfully defeats modern-day terrorists in classic Nelson DeMille style. His best yet!"
4,consistant Nelson Demille,"I'm no stranger to Neslon Demille, but he is always one step ahead of where I think he is going. John Corey was a great character from plum island and continued right into the lions game with the same sense of humor and attitudes. I look forward to John corey's next move."
4,The continuing saga of John Corey....,"I am new to Nelson Demille books, and chose to read Plum Island as my first. I was hooked to the realistic humour of his characters, immediately! When I learned that the main character John Corey was also the main character in this book I had to buy it. This book held up to the expectations that Plum Island delivered, right until the penultimate chapter, which was rushed and it felt that the author ran out of steam. Perhaps the story will be continued in another novel? However, even though the ending was not as exciting as the rest of the book, it was still a book that was very hard to put down. I am now buying Gold Coast and May Day and can't wait to read them!"
3,DeMille drifted too much for me...,"While I love the plot and devoured the book, some of the repetition took away from the compelling pace. This was one case where the action after the mountain was all up hill!"
3,Better Ending Would Have Earned 4 Stars,"I beleive Plum Island was DeMille's best work to date and John Corey the best character he had created. However, with The Lion's Game, I think we spend too much time inside of Corey's head. We spend 600 pages waiting for John and Kate to catch on to what Asad is doing. And then when they figure it out, nothing. We are left with nothing. I could not believe I invested so much time into reading this book only to have an ending that left me feeling empty. How was it possible for his editors to let him get away with this ending?"
4,Highly inventive and mostly satisfying.,"This is the sixth Nelson Demille novel I have read, and I think it is his best told story in a while. I highly recommend about 99% of this book, but I must admit that the ending 1% left me quite a bit dissatisfied. The opening sequence is one of the most original I have come across in an action-thriller, and that alone is worth reading this book for. After such a lengthy bit of reading, however, I would have appreciated a culmination which didn't leave so many unanswered questions."
3,"90% 4 Stars, 10% 2 Stars","For all but the last 50-75 pages of this 673 page book, The Lion's Game presented a very interesting plot, multi-dimensional characters including a memorable terrorist with whom you could have sympathy despite his despicable acts, humor and lots of excitement. I was feeling that this is the rare sequel that is better than the original. BUT... then came the ending! Or rather the lack of one that provided any sense of closure or satisfaction. It seems that Mr. DemIlle just ran out of steam and decided that rather than provide a ""real"" ending, he'll write yet another sequel. While The Lion's Game is a book that is enjoyable, it could have been so much better."
1,"On the bad Scale, 25 Stars","I give this book 25 stars on the bad Scale only because the reader is drawn into a pretty good story for 600+ pages only to be rewarded with a cliffhanger ending!I did not ignore my husband, turn off the phone, and miss a beautiful Saturday in the Los Angeles sun (70s and sunny this past Saturday) to not have the gratification of finding out what happens to Asad!!!!I would only HOPE that a sequel is on it's way. Until then, IT BADD!!!!!!!"
3,Much too long!,"We are BIG Demille fans. Been readinG since GOLD COAST AND CHARM SCHOOL - loved PLUM ISLAND. But this latest best seller is a whopping 677 pages that seemed like a milion. Slow, snails travel at light speed compared to this book. Only thing longer and duller, also making money off of his name for past products in Clancy"
2,"Not too bad, but formula","The writing style is Ok, but the plot is pretty predictable and the ending was easily amongst the worst I've read in years: VERY unsatisfying! I was pretty disappointed overall."
1,$9.99 or else,Why would anyone pay more than $9.99 for a kindle book when the paperback sells for less. Give me a break! I am a voracious reader but will go to the library rather than be ripped off and I hope everyone else does the same.
2,not worth it,"Fun beginning, fun end, but the middle and majority was a complete bore. The main problem is there is NO mystery to the story at all. You know what's going to happen, then it happens...chapter for chapter. I don't know about his other novels, but this one seriously lacks in the ""how to tell a good story"" department."
2,Disappointing performance - not worth the effort,"I bought this book to have something special for my vacation. I was sadly disappointed to find out that it didn't live up my expectations. The beginning is very gripping (especially if you happen to be on an aeroplane experiencing turbulence as I was at the time) but all to soon it just gets plain dull and tedious as the never ending hunt for the terrorist begins. Also, the ending is sad and uneventful. Save your money or buy a Harry Bosch novel instead."
4,GREAT UNABRIDGED ENTERTAINMENT!,"I listened to the Unabridged version and was so entertained I didn't want to leave the car! The seriousness of a thriller combined with the humor, while in the first person, of John Corey. Unfortunately Plum Island was only available abridged and I never got to know Corey as well. If I were an author I would never allow abridgement of my work! Lines like ""the CIA brought Croisants, the FBI home made Brownies and the NYPD brought Donuts"" had me rolling in my seat. Scott Brick had a wit in his voice that was perfect as the Corey first person and a seriousness that portrayed Kahlil. It captivated me although the ending could have played further - perhaps there is a sequel in the works! MayDay (my favorite audiobook) and The Lion's Game are the only DeMille works that are unabridged. I would love to hear Charm School and Word Of Honor!"
3,Enough wise-cracking cops,"I was put off by the typo on page 36 ""teaming cauldron"" but was well into the plot by that time and continued on. DeMille is a brilliant writer but has apparently decided cash in on popular culture and write about a wise-cracking cop, a genre that has already been overdone by Robert Parker and others. The story line definitely fell apart at the end. His earlier books were much better - Charm School, The Gold Coast."
4,Demilles got game!,"Get ready for another ride on the Demille rollercoaster! This book takes an upclose, in your face look at terrorism here in the United States. It brings home the real possibilities that exist and makes you wonder, not if, but when. Another important aspect of this novel was to bring home the fact that terrorists are intelligent, unlike some people seem to want to believe. This was a fast paced story, and while the ending may have dissapointed some, I believe any other ending would have detracted from the plausibility of this tale. Great book, great read! If you already love Demille don't miss this one. If you have never read Demille, now is the time to begin!"
5,DeMille is an American treasure,"Forget Grisham, Patterson, Baldacci. These guys may sell, but they sure can't write. DeMille does both! If you've never read Nelson DeMille, now is the time. The Lion's Game is DeMille at the top of his own game. And after you've read this one, go back and read every single book he's ever written. He'll delight and entertain you time after time, with intelligence, humor and suspense."
5,Highly humorous,"A hilarious book based around high action drama. A terrorist is killing people in America. No one is able to find him. The ex-NYPD on the case (now working with the FBI) is determined to apprehend him. The author lightens the blow of seriousness with John's sense of humor. You'll be seriously spellbound one minute and laughing the next. At first, I didn't think I would like The Lion's Game, but quickly changed my mind after the first few pages. An excellent read!"
4,"We read for Entertainment, Here's some",If your reason for reading is other than entertanment then this book is not for you. It is not deep in political signifigance or is it a thick plot. It is well written plot development with a few interesting characters thrown in.Our hero ex-cop is a cynical middle age wise cracking guy who has seen it all. He gets a job with an anti terrorist group and investigates the murder by gassing of a whole airplane full of innocents. He gets a cute female partner and cracks the case. What more could you want?How many 900+ page books keep your undivided attention the whole way. That is a ton of entertainment for a reasonable price. Yes the ending is a bit weak but what the heck you've been happy for 900 pages whats a little disappointment for 10 or 15?Recommended for a good read between heavy novels.
4,I've read better De Mille books,"I found ""John Corey's"" constant sarcastic comments ridiculous. The book (which was 926 pages long) could have been a much more compact read without them. His annoying character spoilt what otherwise would have been a good thriller, despite the disappointing ending. Not up to the standard of his previous novels."
5,Marvelous!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book for many reasons. It included a balanced mix of action, suspense, wit, and even romance. DeMille is an incredibly talented writer, and I think his depiction of John Corey is fantastic. A long book that is so easy to read, thanks to the intriguing plot and quick dialogue. A detailed account of Khalil really gave me a new perception on what jihad really is. I bought this book when it first came out and never had the chance to read it...I'm very sorry about that, given the recent terrorist attacks. I haven't read a DeMille novel that I didn't like, and I can't wait to sink my teeth into another! Overall, very enjoyable and worthwhile!"
2,"Not terrible, but not good","Demille is a good writer and a lousy story teller. This is the first book of his I read. I was looking forward to reading more. But not now. He is in serious need of an editor. Reminds me of Weber.The first 200 pages are a decent read with a solid B. Then the author goes completely off track. In a major way. He loses the story line, seems to forget how to convey a story and has the reader reading about meetings and conferences and just garbage.This stuff doesn't help character development, it doesn't help the story and is exceedingly boring.I give an F.From page 200 to 700 is full of this. Then finaly around page 700 he decides to finish the book and the next 200 is a decent B read.A good editor would have cut out 200-700 and had a real decent B book. Instead, the writer gives an impression of someone who needs to do a lot more work on his craft because he isn't up to grade level.He writes like a journalist and not a story teller."
4,The Lion's Game,"Love love love Nelson DeMille, and love the character John Corey! Scary though, that its a work of fiction, but all too true."
5,Great characters and pacing!!!,"This was my first DeMille book and I'm an instant John Corey fan. This is a first person story told by John, a member of the Terrorist taskforce, and third person when Asad Khalil is on the scene. This is a cat and mouse genre story. If you like wise cracking narrators then you will enjoy John Corey who has authority issues, which he uses to full use to crack on the FBI, CIA, and who ever else that might act too important. He is also about the safety of the average person which makes his behavior tollerable and enjoyable. He and his love interest add just enough flavor to the storylines and lighten the story when needed.I'm definately reading the four previous Corey books!!!"
3,Not DeMille's Best...,"Not a bad book, but the ending leaves a lot to be desired. It was anticlimactic and very disappointing. It also seemed to be a set up for a sequal that never came. (Nightfall, the next John Corey novel, was a completely unrelated plot-line.) Read Plum Island if this is your 1st Nelson Demille book. If it's not, skip The Lion's Game and go read a Lee Child novel."
3,"A bit wordy, but overall pretty good","Read this book 12 years ago (2000)enjoyed it then and decided to read it again. I enjoyed it this time, just not as much as the first time."
4,"Good stuff, i like it,Good stuff, i like it,Good stuff, i like....sddedf d d d d d d d ds","Good stuff, i like it,Good stuff, i like it,Good stuff, i like....sddedf d d d d d d d ds"
3,Little Ashes,"Decent film, with a really nice music track. If one has read Dali's autobiography, and a couple other pieces on him, Pattinson's portrayal seems pretty spot on..........quirkey, but then, this is Dali! Solid British actors fill out the cast."
2,"Little Ashes, Little budget.","I thought the only good things the movie had was a young, untrained Robert Pattinsonthe the location of Spain. It was a small budget film and it shows. It didn't show enough of the works of Lorca or Dali. I thought I would have liked to see from what well Salvadore Dali sprang from.All in all, not a waste of time, but it could have been better."
5,"Very Different, but excellent!","This was such a strange movie at times, but it was very interesting to watch, trying to figure out what was happening. Great acting though by both men, I really enjoyed this one."
5,One of the best movies I have ever seen.,"I love Salvador Dali, and having done some research about him and Frederico Garcia Lorca, I found the story stayed so true to fact. That makes a movie for me. The dedication of all the actors, the enthusiasm, living in the moment in Spain during the revolution, was depicted so well. Pattinson, although not much acting under his belt, played his heart out in this one. I laughed so much, and cried my eyes out too. I would recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind, and a little knowledge about its context. Watching the interview with some of the actors, the director, and the playwrite really helped me. Not for Twi's looking for ewey gooey Rpatz. Not gonna happen."
4,Char,"This was a movie that I had to watch twice to get thegist of what was really going on in the time period.I wasn't all that familiar with the revolution that wasgoing on in Spain, and the personal freedoms that weresoon to end, to the ""free thinkers"" artists, writers ofthat time. Javier Beltran, Rob Pattinson, and MatthewMcNulty, are excellent as Federico Lorca, Salvador Dali,and Luis Bunuel.The three become friends at the famousMadrid School of Fine Arts. There they challenge theirrespective art worlds with new ideas, pushing theenvelope with their work, mixed with forbidden attractionsthat will determine what the future will be for them,and how they will be remembered. Don't pass this by, itis well scripted and very well acted."
3,Uneven but compelling at times,"Luis Bunuel ends up getting short shrift here, and the focus is really on the relationship between Lorca and Dali. I thought Pattinson's accent slipped a bit now and then but he was all right for the most part. The other actors were stronger, however.Dali denied any attraction to Lorca IRL although they were friends and Lorca preferred men. In the film it's played as if they were having a more intense affair than they actually were. The film also covers some of Spain's political problems in the 1920s and onward, some of which account for what happened to Lorca later.There is some lovely instrumental music in the soundtrack as well."
3,Major Disappointment,"Being a Dali freak, I looked forward to seeing this film. Although some scenes were well-acted and/or visually beautiful, the story really never got itself together. In the end, the viewer never gains any insight into Dali, Garcia Lorca, or the time period in which the film was set. Robert Pattinson does not do very well in depicting Dali; he alternates between acting as if he were in a trance and letting his eyes bug out in an attempt to capture Dali's personality. It's a tough part, admittedly, but he does nothing to show us the man behind the reputation."
3,"""Green, how I want you green...""",Javier Beltran's Lorca makes the entire movie... I couldn't tell what Pattinson was about - and perhaps that is what Dali was about. I think Pattinson was channeling Depp: at the start he was clearly doing Edward Scissorhands - and near the end it was a blend of Willie Wonka and Cap'n Jack Sparrow. But Lorca was beautiful and moving throughout.
2,Skip it,"Very in depth piece that was really sketchy as far as weaving the whole story together. The actors are fine, but overall its a miss."
2,Little Trash,"What's good about this movie are the vistas that were beautifully shot. Looking past the bad direction, writing and delivery of lines, I thought the actors were passable except for the guy who played Dali. I was only peripherally aware of Robert Pattinson's existence because of his ""Twilight"" movie fame, but I totally forgot he was in ""Little Ashes"" when I began watching it. I kept saying to myself this guy playing Dali was fresh from a high school theatre elective and was badly miscast. The other reviewer did the right thing by hitting ""Eject"" after 20 minutes of this DVD."
2,Still scratching head...,"This movie (and ""How to Be"") makes me think Robert Pattinson is trying to be the next Johnny Depp. I could see Johnny Depp in the role of Dali because he has a talent for eccentric roles. Pattinson just doesn't cut it. While the rest of the cast seem comfortable in their rolls, Pattinson constantly appears on edge and seems almost frightened to deliver his lines. I'll be the first person to raise my hand and say that while Pattinson is very handsome, his acting skills are better suited for bubblegum teen movies or light-hearted romantic comedies.It is an interesting story but the poor acting of the lead role takes away from that."
2,"Needs ""Closed Caption""","If you buy this DVD when it comes out, be sure it has closed captions, I loved the movie and couldn't understand most of the words spoken. With the actors broken English, soaring background music, and poor sound quality it was terribly frustrating to follow the movie. Look for the ""CC"" on the back of the DVD box if it isn't there... forget it, unless you want to follow a gorgeous movie as a silent film."
3,Beautifully filmed.,"I knew nothing of this story, and was still entertained. I had to watch it a second time because the Spanish actors accents were all so heavy that I missed dialog. I love art but I've never understood any of Dali's paintings. If any part of this story is true then it explains some of his work, he was a a manic depressive ego maniac."
4,Captivating and lush,"Film I heard about, but was not able to see in the theater here since it never showed here, only in select theaters. What a shame. I ordered it hoping it would be good, it is. A good movie, a pleasure to watch. All the actors excellent, no mis steps. Robert Pattinson playing a quirky,young,outsider - Dali(not the deliberate studied eccentric of later eras). Beautiful, lush camera work and compelling story. Meet Garcia Lorca, Dali, Bunuel, Gala, et al."
2,Not Watchable,"I'm a huge fan of Robert Pattinson, but this film simply isn't watchable or interesting in any way. I stopped watching it after the first 20 minutes, even though I generally like stories based on artist's lives. The portrayal of Salvador Dali was just too weird and unbelieveable."
1,NO NO NO!!!,"Let me say this if you are a Robert Pattinson fan DO NOT watch this movie!!! It will change your view of him terribly. His acting is good in the movie but to see him kiss another man was just TO MUCH for me. However if you want another movie with him in it I recommend ""Remember Me"" it is a GREAT movie. I have just recently ordered the ""The last airman"" and hope it doesnt let me down. Like i said his acting is good its just not a movie one of his fans from twilight should watch cause he is gay in this movie not that Im against that but when a person has a crush on an actor its hard to look at him the same way after you see him making out with a man no offense."
4,Air please,This window fan is great. My boyfriend is a smoker and this helps keep the smoke from smelling up the place!
4,good book,"yes, this book does have a few mistakes and it is short, but it is packed with info. while all of america is including all muslims as terrorists, it is nice for someone to stick up for them and show america what this ""war"" really is doing and will do."
1,"Smart Title, Bad Book","This book was suggested to me as I embarked on a research paper on Islam and its cultural implications on the west for a political science class I'm taking. It first started out well, however, It lost me after a few pages. I felt that it lacked the academic analysis of a researcher and ended up being highly speculative. and verging on the propaganda side. could not use it in a paper.would recommend you borrow it first before you purchase it."
3,"Not so fast, Pinko!","The author is a Berkeley professor who tries to argue that Bin Laden and George Bush are the same because they are both misogynistic fundamentalists. Not so fast, Pinko! Bin Laden's crew was shooting little girls in the back of the head for the crime of learning to read. George Bush's wife is a professional librarian."
2,War on Terrorism,I agree. Prof. G. should have assigned a different book.this book does not deal with any issue of international law. it sounds more like a collection of quotes and theories promoted by the Guardian and the Nation than anything else. very one sided.and the book ends without giving any kind of alternative or advice. an example of what not to do in a book.
1,would not recommend,"the only thing good about this book is probably the picture on the cover. everything else is not only speculation but really farfetched speculation. the guy has a website angryarab.blogspot.com, where all he does is attack the US and Israel. has nothing good to say about anybody or about any effort the US has put into Afghanistan or Iraqwould not recommend the book.. people can get better source of information from the internet or from the Times.. he is a classic example of the disenchanted arabs who have lost their identity and have replaced it with random systems of thought"
5,It really does offer practical solutions to practically all,"Despite being an experienced early childhood teacher with over 16 years experience, I still refer back to this book on a regular basis. It could be useful before teaching as a preventative, or as a resource when problems arise. I find it most useful around conference time when I'm preparing for those more challenging conferences. Look at the table of contents, and you will see it offers suggestions from classroom environment, getting along with co-workers and parents, typical behaviors that are challenging, and unusual behaviors. Each section offers preventative advice and then what to do when problems do occur. THe advice is not always thorough, but it does address a wide variety of real classroom problems."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!,"One of the best early childhood books I have ever read, not mainly due to innovative solutions that really work. Instead, Saifer's sheer attention to the little things (like ""the runner"", ""the restless child"") and the taboo things (like ""the children from divorced families"", ""the sexually focused child"", and ""the masturbation-prone child"") makes this book a must read fo the anyone teaching young kids. Please get it. It will inform you much."
1,Useless!,"These essays are outdated, answer irrelevant questions and are entirely too long. They are good only to read and say - ""I can do better than that."" Besides, reading other people's essays is not as useful as a good book full of advice on which topics to cover and how to write. Save your money."
3,3 Stars for 3 Good Songs,"This band is all right but I can't stand any of there songs except for the remakes. Enter Sandman, White Wedding, and Caldonia are all cool and you should buy this cd. But beyond the coolness of the remakes is nothing but a 2 star band with a really wierd male vocalist."
1,Awful Swing,"If you buy this, shame on you. This is crud of the highest order. Morty This band is one I have seen live and always liked it, but not recently. All the good players have left, and Morty seems to keep this band going for no reason. Lame-o-la! I miss Vise Grip and Connie Champaign!"
1,VOMIT!,I've scraped things off of the bottom of my shoe that are more compelling this this record. The band is just out right terrible.
3,Mortified!,"Connie Champagne has a wonderful voice, Vise Grip is one crazy guy and the band is wonderful. Songs are in Louis Prima & Keely Smith Style. ""Enter Sandman"" is nothing special, ""White Wedding (Rebel Yell) Medley"" is cool, ""Caldonia"" is Caldonia, but songs like ""Baby What's Up"", ""15 Months in Jail"", ""Blue Martini"", ""Shoppin' Mall Mama"",""Knockin' at Your Door"",... are really great. Very entertaining!"
1,hang it up!,this cd was terrible. worst mix ever and the trumpet player needs to move on. saw the band twice and the singers were great live. saw them again and its a different band. saw them once again and another new band. enjoyed seeing who is in the band more than the music. new singers weak and no energy
1,This is REALLY bad!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It is too bad the people that are trying to play their instruments didn't learn how. They are out of tune, the singers have no melodic sense, and the arrangements are juvinile at best. When is the swing revival going to have a group with some depth and polish? These pretenders are just trying for a buck and UNFORTUNATELY getting it."
1,ZERO Stars was not an option!,"This is the worst album I've ever heard - led by the weakest trumpet player I've ever heard. If you ever bought one of those records that actually makes you physically ill to listen to it, this is one of them."
4,Awesome Bag!!,"This is a great backpacking bag. I purchased the long version, which is actually pretty big. I am 6'2"" and probably should have got the regular length, because having the empty space at my feet causes some cool spots (to remedy this I shove extra clothes in the bottom of my bag) but if you like to bury yourself deep in your bag, the long one might be for you. It's lightweight and compact when compressed. I prefer synthetic fill to down, because synthetics still insulate even when wetAs with most bags, the 30 degree rating means you will survive a 30 degree night. It also depends if you are a warm or cold sleeper. I tested this bag on a 38 degree night and was just slightly cooler than I'd like, but I slept well. I use this with a mummy liner on cooler nights, and it is fantastic.I give 4 stars because there is better out there but you will have to fork out the bucks for them!"
2,Eureka Silver City 30 degree,"Not even close to comfortable at 30 degrees, or 40 degrees! Difficult to zip up all the way once inside. Zipper will not stay zipped. Might make a good summer bag, but this one isn't for cold weather."
2,30F? Really?,"I just got back camping from Mammoth Caves Kentucky; it was 47F the first night and I shivered all night long. I usually sleep at home with a 64F A/c unit blowing on me with a thin blanket (my wife sleeps with a winter blanket year round over her on her side of the bed, poor girl :P). Anyway, was inside a tent protected from elements and was still cold.On the second night, the temp dropped to 43F; I ended up borrowing a winter blanket from my wife who was snuggled up with our two year old, I was toasty warm, but only after using the blanket.Notes:1) 47F was still cold, sleeping on air mattress with blanket underneath.2) Required additional blanket over top to maintain warmth, downside since I was hoping to use this for spring/summer hiking.3) Zipper gets caught on fabric when being zipped up or down, requires you to ""rip"" the fabric from the zipper. Did not damage the fabric, but still...I loved the light weight of the unit, just not the performance or the zipper functionality."
3,Decent Bag,"I have slept in this on the Connecticut seaside in early summer and it was freezing and the temps certainly did not reach 30 degrees or even 40 degrees at night and it was freezing, but for summer backpacking it is perfect because it is sooo lightweight and can be soo compact. But good for the price if you don't plan on camping in below 40 degree temps."
3,Packs Small but not warm,"Good price, light weight, but was out in 30 degree weather last night and I was cold, this is closer to a 40+ bag. Good for summer use."
2,like sleeping in a tube sock?,"The only reason I give this bag 2 stars is for it's very light weight and how well it packs down. If that was all I was concerned with I'd give an enthusiastic 5 stars. However, this bag is so narrow that it's like sleeping in a tube sock. I'm not a big guy (5'7"" & 165), but the width from the shoulders thru the hips is very narrow. So much so, that I had to sleep with my arms outside ... which kinda defeats the 30 degree rating of the bag. Needless to say, I was cold and uncomfortable all night long. I did like the foot box ... plenty of room there for my size 9 feet. I've returned my bag and very glad I decided not to tough it out."
3,cold when humid,"I was inconfortably cold last night in my long underwears, temperature was merely 50 F . It was humid and foggy, so maybe this is a factor, but I am still disapointed."
1,Not impressed,"I bought this bag for my 11 year old daughter. It may be great for expeditions, but for regular car camping, no. It was paper thin so there was no loft to be cozy in. I sent it back and ended up buying a great bag at our local Big 5."
1,Zipper busted right out of the package,"This was purchased for me a few months ago. I took it out of the pouch today and unzip it. When I try to zip it back up the end won't go back together. It is ""loose"". I can connect and zip up but then the end comes undone and unzips. The return date has already gone by so now I have a sleeping bag made for the cold that I can't zip up. In reality what I have is a waste of money. If Eureka's zippers are that crappy then I can never trust them enough to take them camping."
1,I wish I didn't c u,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Even ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Open Water 2"" were better. Nothing happens, it's boring, the acting is terrible, the voice-dubbing is bad - the plot makes no sense - the whole thing is terrible. I couldn't wait for this movie to be over. Don't waste your money. Not even worth the ten bucks I spend on it."
3,ICU Review,"I thought that Margot Robbie's performance was great and I wanted the DVD purely because she was in it, whereas the the other actors/actresses performances were quite forced and unnatural.The plot-line was quite confusing, the word 'Why?' was brought up a fair bit while watching the movie.Not a bad movie for the budget, I'm glad I bought it, but it could've been much, much better."
3,Not a luxury item at all!,"Average comforter. Loud when you toss around in it. Nothing special here, I don't think it's worth plucking down close to $100 for this set at all. Save your money and buy the best possible. The difference in down comforters are extremely clear as you go up in price/quality."
2,"No-frills, avg joe down comforter","from the reviews on this site, i bought this when it was on sale for $79. I was expecting a near-luxury bedding comforter, but it is not. It is a little noisy, but tolerable. The thread count is just sufficient. i have another one that's 300+ thread count and is much smoother. Also, I'm returning my because it is leaking feathers already. Could be an anomoly, but I've decided to choke up some cash and get a premium comforter to keep for years. This one is a sufficient shortterm solution."
4,Well worth the money..l,I got this comforter when it was only $59.99 and it was well worth the price. Light yet very warm. Came in a nice cover for storage.I have seen similiar comforters since I work in retail and None have the quality for this price.VERY SATISFIED
5,Great and Gloomy,If you love Eeyore you'll love the Eeyorisms in this Book. The pictures go along with every page of Eeyore Wisdom. I am sure anyone who buys this Book will treasure it--I Really recommend getting Eeyore's(Gloomy)Little Instruction Book.
4,I LOVE my Minolta DiMAGE Z1!!!,"I have had my Z1 for a year and a half, and it is great! The 10x optical zoom is outstanding, and makes for the best pictures! I could never go back to another camera without the 10x or greater zoom now. I have taken thousands of pictures and had no problems with this camera. I purchased mine for $400 and it was well worth it. I love that you can use AA batteries, in case my rechargeable batteries die unexpectedly. And, when reviewing cameras I found that this cameras lag time was short compared to other digicams. My only negative with this camera is that the lens cover is not sturdy, and broke within the first month of having it.I love this camera so much that I am now going to buy my husband one to use for his job! Shhh, it's a surprise!"
5,Great Bang for the Buck!,"More lens than the vast majority of digi cameras out there. Shoots fast, shoots well in dim light conditions. MANY features!"
4,I love this music,"Thank your stars for the folks at ""The Old Masters"" who are recovering lost treasures of American music, shining off the tarnish with digital re-mastering, and selling it with thorough notes. This is high quality popular music from 1931 - 33, and will make you think of the Hal Roach studio comedies. It is toe-tapping stuff. It makes you happy like the music of Bob Wills and Fats Waller does."
4,An interesting true story,"The most enjoyable autobiographies are those written in a decent style by non-celebrities, and which illuminate realms of human experience strange to the reader. This is a very nice example. You will want to read it."
5,"Thought-provoking, meaningful reading","My heart and mind are still wrapped up in this book. Usually, upon finishing one book, I immediately jump into another one, but I can't quite seem to do that with this book. This book is so full of life, it's hard to put down. Alexandra writes about her childhood in Africa so well...It's right out there, she doesn't mince words and she tells it exactly like it is. We see everything through Alexandra's eyes. We experience poverty in Africa, racism in Africa, life in Africa. That is exactly what this book is...an experience and one that is not to be missed!"
4,Interesting Story From An Unusual Childhood,"As one might expect, a tale of a child growing up amid a vicious bush war in Africa would be interesting and this book is definately that. Ms. Fuller lists the traumas of life in Rhodesia during the war including her parents warning her not to startle them or they might shoot her, a policeman warning her and other children not to pick up gaily decorated packages because they could be booby-trapped, and other harrowing tidbits. However, in spite of everything, she and her family survived which is a testament to their strength of spirit. I heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in that period."
2,Leaves much to be desired,"I have to say, I was certainly looking forward to reading this book, having heard much about it from family and friends (I'm from Zimbabwe). Perhaps it is the fact that I am not a white Zimbabwean, but from the first pages, I had a bitter taste in my mouth. I admired the writing, but that was about it. The overwhelming impression that we had of whites growing up in Zim became manifest in this book, and I was transported back to those days. The most disturbing thing for me was the lack of remorse...no, redemption, by the author. She would relay stories about her racist parents, her upbringing and such, and did not transmit any sense that all this was not right, not humane. Strange how the same words can be read by different people and evoke such divergent responses."
3,Still Can't Tell What Africa's Like,"I was really excited to read this book. I encouraged my book club to read it, but it was sorely disappointed by the end. I was disappointed due to the lack of description in this memoir. I really hoped that there would be a broader picture of what Africa and growing up in Africa was really like. I felt that there where a lot of holes in the memoir. I never understood why Fuller's parents came to Africa in the first place. What were her feelings about colonization?Mostly, I felt like this was a documentation of her drunken family. It was a series of events without much feeling or description attached to it. I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone. If anyone asked about it I would say, ""Meh, it's passable."" I will continue to look for better memoirs."
