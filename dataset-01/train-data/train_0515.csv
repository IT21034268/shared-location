1,mini-series! not a theatrical release,This is the Sci-Fi miniseries (apparently incomplete) not the movie Supernova from 2000 with James Spader. Buyer beware!
2,Double Feature Value?,"When movies are doubled-up, such as this pair, it kinda makes you wonder what the motives are. Supernova/ Poseidon Adventure are two films that deserve each other, but are truly a waste of time to watch and a waste of money poorly spent.Here are two movies that failed to sell well, so the studio decided to pair them up in hopes the two together would bring in $$$$ for their bottom line.The original Poseidon Adventure was an excellent film. This version is trash from beginning to end. Supernova is not even a tic better. Save your time & money, and forget this pair."
2,Hallmark does it again....drag out drama,"The standard Hallmark background music plays for hours on end. The world seems to be coming to an end due to a super nova. This mini-series will never come to an end.Do we tell?Who do we tell?Is there an evil plot to the end?Will Dr. Austin Sheppard (Peter Fonda) find time enough for love?Will an evil being abduct Brooke and Haley?Do we really care?We get to watch some great acting by Tia Carrere, born on 1967 as Althea Janairo, 11 years after she gained acknowledgement in the blockbuster film ""True Lies"" (1994). And let's not forget Peter Fonda who played Frank in ""The Passion of Ayn Rand"" (1999)."
2,not worth the purchase,"This was a really bad made for tv movie. Poor plot, corny acting and dialog, and you'd think the special effects would at least make up for everything else. Nope. They weren't very good for what you'd expect from the title, it was just a few fireballs shooting through the air. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
3,A Continually Scary Story,"Tim Lahaye's and Jerry Jenkins' ""Left Behind"" series is a continually scary story. It has a similar theme as that of a book by Jerry Furland titled, ""Transfer: The end of the beginning"". Although ""Left Behind"" and ""Transfer"" are both entertaining fiction, the Furland book is more credible technically. Its story includes things that are already beginning to happen in the world today, like ""smart cards"", and governments being able to know everything about a person's habits, health information, etc. - things that we thought were supposed to be confidential."
5,"In this book Judd, Vicki, Lionel, and Ryan come to christ.","In this book Judd, Lionel, Ryan, and Vicki all come to christ while Uncle Andre' dies Bruces Barnes help Lionel out with all the trouble of losing a loved one."
3,It's a pretty good book.,"Second Chance was a really good book.It was very interesting, and I would recommend this book because it's really exciting. I think that kids would enjoy this book more than adults, because it's mainly written for kids."
3,Great but not for musical reasons,"The Sound of the City is informative and provides a detailed account of the economical, artistic, and sociological forces that shaped pop music at the beginning of the 20th century. The detailed listening list at the end of the book is helpful and serves as an excellent propaedeutic to its study."
5,My son loves these,I got these for my son because his dad used to wear them. He really likes them and the price was really good.
3,Ears and Nose,The nose bridge and ear pieces are deformed. It hurts my ears and nose.I had to adjust them.The sunglasses work perfectly to ban rays !
5,wear for life,"I've had Ray Bans for over 45 years now. I've worn three or four sets out in a strenuous life. Now I need to replace them. I like shopping at Amazon...but I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANY glasses without enough information, like; WHAT ARE THE SIZE OF THE LENS IN MM? This is a very important question.Spending this kind of money for sunglasses, even as good as these are is serious and I need this question answered before I lay out the cash. (Trying to figure out a code isn't good enough. Just print out the mm size!)What do ya say, Amazon? You've got a great, great product here.... lay it on the line like a good capitalist."
4,Too Small for Men,"This was to replace a pair of Ray Ban Outdoorsman Aviators that I have had for 15 years. I thought that they looked the same, and didn't realize that some are smaller than others. In this case, the actual size is not stated anywhere in the description. The glasses are too small for men, and the ear pieces will hurt your ears. If you are a child or a woman with a small head, these are very high quality good sunglasses.The next time I spend $100+ for a set of sunglasses, it will be over the counter at a sporting goods store, even if it costs a little more. At least I'll know exactly what I am buying."
5,Bada Bing Fabulous,"As a frequent traveler, this has been a great entertainment source. Great to review the seasons and pick up additional information, good story line, and excellent characters!"
1,Confused,"I think that Shabana Azmi is a truly great talent, but this movie was confusing. The acting appeared to be mailed in and the movie direction and language never really focused. I would not reccommend this movie as when Shabana does an English speaking movie she performs as if she is frantic; unlike the subtleties she implements when she is doing a movie in her language. In English she rushes, in her language she moves fluidly. In english speaking15 Park Avenuemovies I suggest that she let the movie come to her."
1,Unsatisfied Customer,"I own the entire MASH series and I was appalled when FOX released the final season with no extra's hoping those that shelled out over $300 would shell out another $130. This is a trend that all companies are making. Rather than reward loyal customers, they have come up with this game of releasing a watered down version only to release a better version next year and even better the year after that.If you don't mind not having extra's and just want the show's, then this set is for you."
5,One of My Favorite Shows,"I didn't discover M*A*S*H until the 80's, but I was instantly hooked. I love the fact that they took what started as pure comedy and realized it could be so much more. They had room to make social commentary about war and race among other things and they could still do comedy in between. It didn't have to be heavy handed or preachy. The final two hour episode is one of the best; and also one of the most emotional."
5,Mash,Came in excellent shape. Was here very qucikly. I am totally happy with the product and service
5,MASH is Great,If you love MASH you HAVE to have this box set. It is the last season and the final movie. Great to have if you collect the series.
1,m.a.s.h. season 11,I WANT TO KNOW WHY ON EARTH YOU ARE ONLY SELLING THE SPECIAL FEATURES WITH THE COMPLETE BOX SET AND NOT BY ITSELF.WHY AIN'T IT INCLUDED WITH THE 11TH SEASON.YOU GET THE PEOPLE TO SPEND A WHOLE LOT MORE BUYING THEM SEPERATELY THAN AS THE COMPLETE SET AND DON'T OFFER THE EXTRAS ON THE LAST SEASON.I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED OR AT LEAST OFFER IT TO ALL THE LOYAL FANS WHO HAD ALREADY BOUGHT THE COMPLETE SET.
3,DVD quality not so good.,"Of course the shows were great, just as I remembered them. The problem was with the recording on the DVD itself. There was one show which was pretty much unwatchable because it would freeze and blur. I have had this experience with other shows in other seasons, but this was the worst. I have seriously considered asking Amazon if there is some way to get my money back. And yes, I trouble shot it on other DVD players. So I'd say the quality was somewhat disappointing."
2,Disappointed,"I've been collecting the individual episodes, all the time hoping the (shorter) 11th season set would have some extras. None. And to top it off Fox has released a mega collection that has the entire series, attractively packaged, with 2 bonus discs - at a fraction of the price. Fox should really offer the 11th season with bonus discs for the loyal customers who have been buying the discs all along."
2,Not what I expected!,"The cover is aluminium,not a glass one.When the oil is very hot, the color of part of the inner wok will change to brown. This has never happened to my previous calphalon wok.I don't recommend this wok."
2,Damaged goods,"I got my order on time and with everything I asked for, but one of the bags was punctured and some of the contents coated a lot of the rest of the bags. Messy and disappointing since when I pay for something I expect to get all of it in good condition. Unfortunately, I live overseas and ordered this product when I was back in the U.S. I did not have the time to pursue this matter further."
3,Make whatever you want.,"Add water its Gatoraide, add hate its hateraide, add vodka its faderaide, add love and its loveraide."
4,I really enjoyed this book but. . .,"I am really a huge V.C. Andrews fan & I've read atleast 13 of her books(which I loved).I must say I enjoyed this book but the rest of the books in this series were 100%better.The Laundry series is my fav.(besides ""My Sweet Audrina"")because it is very suspenseful."
3,Not the best book in the series.,"I loved the first 3 books and then this one I skipped over alot because it got boring, but I read it anyways to get through it and then I read the 5th book(prequel)which confused me a lot at first until I realized it was meant to be the first book. So far its excellent. But. Hidden Jewel I rated a 3 because its really weak. I actually Live in Houma, Louisiana and found out about these book from a pen pal and was curious what they say about here. I identify with most of the places, but the only thing I;d have to say I dont like is it makes it sound like we live in top of a swamp or something and sure we have swamp and bayou, but its not like we have to boat our way around. we do drive. But this is a great set of books!...."
4,Pretty Good,"Pearl is a lot smarter than some of the other VC Andrew's characters, but I found some things to be odd. I couldn't figure out why she called her parents ""mommy and daddy"" when she is 17 years old. She was very strong when she tried to find her mother, but I felt like when she found Jack, she fell for him a little quickly. He could have easily just turned out to be some jerk. This story line is a little different than the other novels, there are not as many twists and turns. Basically the biggest part of the novel was finding her mother Ruby. I give it 4 stars because I didn't find it as interesting or unique as the other novels, but it is good."
4,My favorite of the series so far...,"I thought the first 3 book in the series were just o.k. & I was glad to see that this 4th book finally pulled me into it. This book is about Pearl, Ruby's daughter. This book was adventurous & took you back & fourth to the Bayou. I couldn't understand how Pearl recall as much as she did from her childhood when she lived in the Bayou because wasn't she like 9 months or something like that when she lived there? This is my least favorite series of V.C. Andrews's series but I did enjoy this book."
4,great book,paperback came in good shape - looked to be only read once before - very happy with delivery - Shipping and handling was way to much for this book!
3,A Gem of a Book,"I can't say that this is the best book in the Landry series. I liked the other daughters' (Annie, Christie) stories, but this book isn't bad and deserves a decent 3 out of 5 stars. I'm sorry to say that a death triggers the series of events here, that's what happened to Annie and Christie and so felt rather repetitive, but this book is overall a decent read. Remember Buster Trahaw? You thought he was gone forever, didn't you? Oh ho ho. And surprisingly, Gladys also comes back - so this story is still an exciting read."
1,Lousy Production - Poor Quality,I've seen Oliver before and he is much better in person. The cuts on this tape show that whoever edited the tape did not know anything about the subject matter. Would you want a lawnmover mechanic to work on your BMW? Save your moneyEnough said
5,Great Christmas CD; Beautiful choir!,"I'm a big fan of choral music, but not so much of solo work. I love the choir's songs, but the solo voice is a bit much for me. Definitely worth buying for the choir's work though. ""Of the Father's Love Begotten,"" ""Once in Royal David's City,"" ""O Du Frohliche,"" ""Still, Still Still,"" and ""In the Bleak Midwinter"" are my favorites (I'm a big fan of the classics), but ""Gesu Bambino/The Bells of Christmas,"" ""Hark! The Herald Angels Sing,"" ""Un Flambeau, Jeanette Isabelle,"" ""The Rocking Song"" and ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" are also beautiful. All of the songs are performed with the purity of a boys choir and the precision of a very experienced choir. Definitely one of my favorite Christmas cds!"
3,"Nice plot, wicked recipes","I liked the way the plot ended so neatly, and the recipes in between chapters were both simple and wicked. Many could be linked with the chapter following them.I did feel it was a little melodramatic in parts, and that most of the characters weren't fleshed out enough..like some of the movies today. This one would probably make a great movie, though."
5,A Heart-Warming Story,"A refreshing story of how a beautiful child becomes part of a family with two Dads. More needs to be written about how so many of children find loving homes by being adopted by gay men.Written from the child's point of view, the book is void of bias and preconceived ideas of the type of love and true bonding of family that two men can provide to a child.Easy to read, with great colorful illustrations, the book is appropriate for children and adults, gay or straight... anyone who enjoys feeling warmth in their hearts and teaching love and acceptance of those around them."
3,A Godsend for our family,"I purchased this book at least a year before our son came to live with us, and I had forgotten about it when it turned up during our preparations for his move-in. My partner and I read it him his first night with us, and it became his instant favorite. He has since requested it every single night before bed, and even though he is only four, he can recite it cover to cover. This book has made him feel so special, and it truly was a godsend in helping him through a difficult transition."
4,"Wunnerful, Wunnerful Wunnerful!","I have loved this album since I was a little girl and we would listen to it every Christmas! I was so excited to find it on CD! I can hear the swooshing sound of the old record album it was burned off of, but I still love it! It brought back so many memories for my brother and mother when I played it at our Family Christmas party."
2,This is not a pattern book !!!,"When I ordered this book, I did not realize of the size. It is a tiny book with some drawings, more adecuate to ilustrate Christmas tales books My mistake, my fault... I just want to warn other people not to make the same mistake."
4,Good for the practice questions,"I have this book and found it pretty helpful with studying for Math A. The book has a ton of practice questions which were very similar in style to the regents questions. My teacher had this book and many times the same questions would come up on tests that I had already done while studying. The explainations of things were pretty wordy and kind of confusing, so I wouldn't buy this book if you want things better explained to you. But I would say it's definitely worth buying this book for all the practice questions. I passed the Math A regents in January 2003 with a 90, thanks to a lot of the practice in this book."
4,Lumley Enthusuasts...Get This!,"Now how the hell I found this gem at my local bookstore I'll never know. I mean my local bookstores suck! It's stuck deep in a business area, where nobody reads horror and they don't even have a horror section! ARGH!Nonetheless, like always I browse by author like I do every week and find this. The Compleat Crow. And what timing too! Right after I got Mythos Omnibus Volume One!A little about the book now. It is a small book of short stories basically dealing with Lumley's character Titus Crow. The first story is very neat. It shows a peek into when Titus was born, just what extraordinary occurance happened! It also has stories that show as the years went on, how his vast knowledge in the occult grew.A definite must for the Crow enthusiast. No Lumley library is compleat without this little ditty. I wish you all the best luck in finding a copy."
5,Colby took me to the battle!,"Colby's book reached a place deep in my heart. He told of the human conflicts our men and women faced in the heat of the desert. I was able to see thru his words, the story my son, who is a soldier, could not share with me. The side the media may never understand.The book far surpassed the blog! I am waiting patiently for Colby's next book. CB rocks!"
4,This guy's got his voice,"Fantastic writing style, you can hear him speaking the words right off the page. You start thinking in his language - probably not a good thing! He's got a smart mouth for sure. I love hearing the male specimen's unbridled point of view on life - that alone is amusing enough to sell me the book, which is based on his journal and blog. But it's not self indulgent - there is a clear subject. This guy is a skate punk my age, from the Bay Area, going to Mosul Iraq with the US Army. Generation X speaks about the war - I only want more clarity of his perceived split between what the news outlets are presenting to Americans vs. his first hand experience. Page turner. I'd love to read about what he's up to now."
5,"Great Book, also read this one...","Colby did a pretty good job with the non fiction part. Well I recommend you all go buy a book writen by another soldier, but this one is fiction based off Detainee Operations in Afghanistan, its calledDetained Differences."
3,OK but nothing spectacular,"I enjoy reading these kinds of memoirs from a grunt's perspective. Colby's style is easy to follow and full of emotive vitriol, however, as far as true combat goes or adventure, excitement and thrills, there was very little of that. It's good reading from a unit history perspective but not a book that's worthy of any awards.The book's beginnings--why and how he joined the Army--was the most interesting. He would write from the past to the future to the present, though, which confused me at times. He truly was one of the many confused yet patriotic Americans who joined after 911 but then didn't have much to write about. Did he join the army so that he could write a book? Was the book just a continuation of his website that the army forced to have shut down? The book became more and more a rehash of his blog entries or journal entries.At best this book makes a good skim-through. Catch it at the library and read the first chapter. The rest is repetitive."
4,If you like Bukowski....,"If you like Bukowski, you will enjoy this book. As an Iraq vet I was skeptical when I picked this book up in a B & N. But I couldn't put it down. A natural storyteller with a story to tell, Colby Buzzell wrote a good book. You can tell his writing is pretty heavily influenced by reading a lot of Bukowski, -definitely a guy you'd like to share a bottle with and share lies from Iraq."
5,Could Not Put It Down!,Read right through without sleep and never bored. Felt as though I was physically there within every chapter and could not WAIT to get to the next chapter.Experienced the outcome a writer wants their readers to live when we open a book.Thanks Again Colby!Mike's MomHouston TX
3,Trash Non Fiction,"This is like bad candy. Interesting and eye-opening, but pretty thin and leaves me with a head ache. Trashy writing but hard to put down."
5,"Colby Buzzell's Book A Great ""Read""","I am about half way through this book. This man can write! Descriptions such as ""a great story teller""; ""intelligent""; ""literate""; ""observant""; ""a wry sense of humor"" come to mind. Even as he jumps from subject to subject, story to story, the flow of the book is outstanding. I can't help thinking that he has a big future as a writer."
3,A light weight in the war memoir categories,"I was hoping for this book to be up there with other books I have read about the Iraq war like, ""Generation Kill"" and ""Thunder Run"", but this book isn't it.Reading ""My War"" is like having access to some guy's diary, where you have to read through a lot of unimportant and irrelevant details of his everyday life, so you can get to the one or two descriptions of enemy contact he experienced during his year in Iraq.This book could have been edited down to a 100 pages, and then it would make for an interesting read.Is a very light read kind of like a magazine article rather than a real war memoir, and the author can be sometimes interesting and funny.I can't recommend it as a good war memoir."
3,Somewhat overrated,"There's no denying the fact that this is a very interesting book. It provides a soldier's view of what's happening in Iraq, instead of dry news bites and statistics that probably serve to further alienate us from reality. However I think that the praise given to this book has been a bit excessive at times. It is well and sharply written documentary, but it tends to be somewhat matter-of-fact and laconic. I would have wished for more of his thoughts on the war and more analysis, but mostly Buzzell just describes the events as they unfold. However, he's definitely good at describing them."
3,Comparative review,"If Colby would have left out the use of the ""F"" word, I would suspect this book could have been reduced about 10 pages in length. F this, F that, 2-3 times a page it seems. I was going to keep track, but that's a waste of my time, and I don't want to go back and reread this thing.I have read volumes of books on both Iraq and Afghanistan fighting and this one is really pathetic. I would guess if I was an alcoholic, druggie, floundering around, and not college bound, then getting this into print was a successful task for the author, and I applaud him for that.I get the feeling that he thinks it's cool to reference all the booze, the swearing, etc. I assuredly was not impressed.I've struggled to stay into this book and am at the halfway point, but I am forcing myself to finish it - hoping there is some worthwhile writing I am about to come into.I am not impressed with this one, and there are others out there that beat the socks off this one; Robert's Ridge, and many others."
3,Gen X'r trying too hard,I found this a bit shoddy. Just not a lot in here to chew on...seemed like Iraq was an extreme playground or something for the author. Thank you for your service but the memoir is disjointed and does not meet standard set by most military memoirs.
3,"Great board, cheapo chess pieces","As the other reviewers have mentioned, the board is gorgeous and well made, but the pieces are of a low quality and are not weighted. So I recommend you buy a nice mini rosewood staunton weighted set as I did for this board-- rosewoood and boxwood chess pieces compliment the board beautifully! Check out the board with my rosewood pieces on the *view customer images* section."
3,Nice board; pieces not so nice,"The board is well made and has a nice appearance. The two halves close with a magnetic latch. The interior is felt lined and has elastic straps to hold the pieces in place so they don't rattle around. The strap is a nice thought, but honestly, who is going to bother carefully tucking in each of the 32 chess men after each game?My beef with this is not the board, but the pieces. They are made of wood, but perhaps balsa wood. They are very light, and at least my set still has lot of wood burrs that weren't sanded off and were simply shellac'd over. Worst of all, though, is that the pieces are not weighted. That is a major sin, contributing to the cheap ""hand feel."" Any slight knock of the board, which is common when playing with kids (which is why I got this), and half a dozen pieces topple over.I'm keeping the board, but I'll be shopping for a new set of pieces."
4,rough locking mechanism,"The lock works, but the mechanism is rough. The dials are hard to turn and it requires a bit of force to move the latch release. I think it is just a symptom of low quality manufacturing. I use it for communting, and yes I have lubed it up, but it has not helped much. Nice to not have to carry a key.Update. I have used it regularly for months now. The mechanism is much easier to use. It has really eased up. The dials turn easily and the latch is smooth. It must not be well finished at the developing world machine shop. I moved it up to 4 stars. Would buy it again."
1,Found a lock in my garage and figured out the combo easy ...,"So I moved into my house and there was this lock left behind. I have the Kryptonite evolution lock (with a key) so never bothered to try and use this one. So earlier today I figured why not try and open it just to see if I could. Turns out it wasn't very hard. Once you push the little plastic knob the dials will wiggle, well it turns out they only wiggle if it's the wrong number. So after about half an hour of playing with it I figured out the combo and it popped open. So if your using this in a high traffic area where people will walk by often I wouldn't see this as a problem, but if it's going to be locked away somewhere where people could sit and spend some time with it (even a couple minutes a day) then I'd go with a keyed lock instead."
4,Years of Service,"I purchased this lock in 2008. I've used it on my bike, outside, in Alameda, CA (plenty of rain). I've had to oil it occationally to keep the tumblers moving. The one sign of wear is the rubber gaskets at the top of each end of the ""U""; they've weathered and cracked, but it doesn't seem to have affected the lock.I think that as long as I oil the mechanism every now and then this lock will last another 5 years.It's soooo great to never have to worry about a key."
1,Do not buy this lock,"This lock broke and became effectively useless after two weeks of moderate use, averaging about two locks/unlocks a day.I had the same problem a few other reviewers had: the plastic knob to open the lock broke off, which renders the whole thing a rather ugly paper weight. I'm now living 300 miles from where I bought it (I just moved), so I can't return it there. And I'd send it in under warranty, but I urgently need to buy a new lock. Thanks, Kryptonite."
3,Not bad for the money,"I paid less than $[...] for this lock on sale and for that kind of money a Kryptonite lock is a great deal. That said, this lock has a couple of shortcomings in my estimation that have to do with the combination wheels. First off, they are generally difficult to turn. They just do not have sufficient knurling to facilitate good thumb/finger traction. Second, the combination wheels are chromed and the indented numbers are filled with black paint. This makes the numbers almost impossible to read under the glare of a street light due to the reflectivity of the chromed surface. Other than those two complaints, I am very happy with this lock, it's solid, compact and yet large enough (barely) to allow me to secure the frame and front wheel to every rack I have encountered without removal of the wheel. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LPHO2Q/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
3,kryptonite kryptolok combo standard bicycle U-lock,Nice lock but the number tabs are small and somewhat hard to manuver. the cover also has to be aligned when opening.Too time consuming.
1,Bad Design,"Like many other reviewers, I had this lock for only a short period before the release button broke off. By looking in the hole where the button post was it is clear that the attachment point fractured about 2-3mm inside the hole. This makes this lock a bad investment. Fortunately Amazon's return policy is stellar and I returned it and purchased a keyed lock. Kryptonite needs to go back to the drawing board on this one."
2,Usable but not recommended,"I found that the numbers are hard to change, they are not very smooth. Also it really is not long enough, I would recommend one that is longer, this one hardly fits around the frame and post at the same time."
1,Should have listened to the other bad reviews...,"I had read several bad reviews about the dials not turning/being difficult to turn, etc., but thought I would give Kryptonite a chance since I had used the brand in the past with good results. I should have listened. The dials are not only difficult to turn, they get stuck easily rendering the piece of crap unusable. I am returning it and buying the bulldog which my girlfriend has and uses with no problems."
1,Not reliable,"This lock was a disaster. I only had it 3 months before it ""seized"" up and couldn't be opened. Luckily, I noticed that it had become stiff and resisted opening so I tested it off the bike. Once locked it could not be opened. You could feel the mechanism release part way but not enough to undo. If this had happened on the bike, I'd had had to saw it off somehow. The company replaced promptly with a keyed lock and I'm content but would warn against buying this combination lock despite theoretical advantage of not having to track the key. I did have to pay shipping to return the defective lock!"
1,Stay Away from this one,"Worked for a week, then my daughter called me from the store, could not unlock her bike. An hour later, after driving to meet her and banging on the lock for 20 minutes, it finally opened. Next step would've been to cut it off. It's reckless to sell a lock this bad, if she'd been on her own the bike would've been left overnight ""locked up"" by this junky lock. Totally different than the one I've used successfully for years so Kryptonite must've outsourced the manufacture. Bad idea. I returned it and switched to a key version, different manfacturer."
1,Unable to set combo,I got the lock. I am unable to set combo after having many people try. It seams cheaply made and the numbers hard to turn. Also the U part of the lock does not feel very thick. DO NOT BUY
1,Cannot change factory default combo,Not useful as the factory default combo cannot change. I attempted to set the combo to a new one but the change did not take affect. After repeated attempts it seems that the lock is broken. Not recommended.
1,Do not buy,"I am very unsatisfied with this lock. After about three months of use, the lock ""broke"", or became ineffective. It began to open when the combination was set to any number making it useless. I sent it in to get a new one per the lifetime warranty, and just received the replacement in the mail. This one does not work well, either. The digit in the thousandths place (the first of four number dials) is very difficult to turn. More importantly, I cannot even get the lock open after setting it the factory setting of 0005. So, both locks of this model have not worked.I had originally started buying Kryptonite in college, and thought they were a high quality brand. My opinion of their products has changed, and will no longer purchase their products in the future."
1,Doesn't lock properly,"The first time I put this lock on my bicycle and went for a ride, I didn't have the combination set and trusted the button to hold it together while I rode. Big mistake, as the U came off and bent the rear derailleur on my new bicycle. OK, that was mostly user error, so I won't blame them. After that I made sure that I scrambled the combination every time I put the lock back on my bicycle. Turns out that's not good enough. I had it locked and stored on my bicycle, and the U fell off again a few months later. I never found it again, and I know you cannot trust a lock that unlocks solely with vibrations. Thieves would have no problem getting it open! If you get this, buy the anti-theft protection, because you will probably need it."
2,Second same failure after two years of use,"I owned one of these locks for a couple of years when I believe the release button became disengaged from whatever it engages internally. I thought I had placed the lock on it side when transporting the bike, causing it to rub on the combination dial and breaking the release. Fortunately, it was not locked to anything and I was able to grind off the lock. Decided to buy another one as it was assumed to be my fault.Second lock again suffered a broken release mechanism. I suspect the same problem. The release has no resistance as like the first failure. Again, fortunately, it was only locked on the bike. Was able to grind off the hasp.I will not buy this lock again as a failure to open when locked to a stationary object would be very inconvenient, not to mention embarrassing to explain why I was cutting the lock."
4,"Great protection, won't lose the key","Second U-lock I had to buy for my daughters bicycle after THUGS stole her beautiful Cannondale hybrid from her college dorm bike rack (that bike was locked with a big ole' cable lock, not recommended against our thieves who are undaunted by police and judicial consequences).Then my daughter locke her keyed U-lock around the frame and lost the key. It is tough to cut these locks off. Apparently a special saw blade is required.I highly recommend the combination Kryptonite lock with a cable to complement."
2,Shoddy parts: broken within a week of owning,"I've had my Kryptonite Kryptolok for under a week and two parts have already broken. The plastic piece that holds the lock on the bike while you are riding fell off my bike into the middle of the street when I went over a bump because the metal pin that holds the two pieces together fell out. Similarly, the button that slides to unlock once the combination is in also fell off because it was not in any way secured. I am very unhappy with this product, as it is virtually unusable because of shoddy parts."
4,Good watch,"I've had this watch for I think 6 years. The band was beautiful, but I wore it so much that the band got too sweaty smelling and so I moved the watch onto a different band. The watch itself has always kept perfect time and has taken quite a bit of abuse (the glass is heavily scratched from use) but still keeps working fine. EXCEPT that the digital seconds in the face of the watch stopped working after a few years. Still, I love it. I am thinking of even buying the same watch again as I am looking for a new one right now, just because that band and watch are so worn out looking."
2,Good looking watch,"This is a very good looking watch, its a shame that it does not keep time at all, it is always hours off, even within the first 3 or 4 hours after you set it, terrible."
5,Towing a 2007 Fleetwood Nigara,"HiI tow a Pop Up coach very heavy.My tow vehicle is a 3.2 Suzuki Grand Vitara v6, and the ball Mount solved all problem with tong Weight.I am in Chile South AmericaRegards from Freddy"
1,dated and forgettable,back in 85 this disc sounded okay.love bizzare is the only song worth seeking out.the album sounds like second rate morris day.shelia is bad on drums but prince can't save this mess.
5,Love it & thanks for the fast service.,Love it & thanks for the fast service. Pleasure doing business with you and I will be sure to return.
5,Fantastic album,I bought this because I'm a Prince fan.This is a must for any serious collector.And if you also like Sheila's non Prince-related output you have a double reason to get it.
3,Minnesota Sheila E. Fan,"Having ordered this CD only for the song ""Bedtime Story"" that I couldn't get out of my head since my step-brother had the ALBUM in 1986, I was more than happy to relive ""A Love Bizarre""--with Prince on vocals, and all the other tracks. The music was fun then (back in the day) and the memories when I play it now are good. As another reviewer stated, I also think this is for collectors or an eighties music fan. If you buy a Sheila E. CD, buy her latest (8 years ago), but still the greatest, ""Sex Cymbal""."
1,An Album Bizarre ( Too Bizarre),"On Sheila's second album Romance 1600 she tried to desperately re-capture or duplicate the success of her debut Glamorous Life album. Didn't work. The only highlights were A Love Bizarre (also from the film KrushGroove) and Sister Fate (a cheap Glamorous Life imitation)! Everything else sounded too experimental and a lot like the outtakes from Prince's mysterious vaults, if not the b-sides from his earlier hits. I do not recommend this album due to it's strange and bizarre tracks(unless you're a hard-core Prince and protogee fanatic). Simply put-- it's a bizarre album!"
3,All 3 Stars For One Track,"Contrary to what others have said in this space, this project does NOT withstand the test of time! The only thing that holds up is, of course, ""A Love Bizarre"". I'm a huge Prince fan, but I feel like I'm getting jacked for ten dollars, because you can't buy ""Bizarre"" as a separate mp3 track. Hey, Amazon, I'd gladly pay three bucks!"
1,Love Bizarre&Shelia E's Drumming are all you need,"this Album was corny back in the day&Prince had Shelia E sounding like a 2nd rate Morris Day. but ""Love Bizarre"" was banging then&still sounds good. Prince should have kept this one for himself personally. Shelia E was banging on the skins. but vocally she is very limited. alot of this album was all over the place&didn't leave a lasting impression. that Flower Power era of Prince is one of the reasons why He fell off so much."
1,probably then but not now,never listened 2 this album when it came out. only like love bizaree. added 2 my prince play it live list...3121...
4,Sheila! Sheila! Sheila E.!,"! Play Those Drums Ms. E.! She delivers a nasty, sexy, hype and glamorous follow up to her debut album ""The Glamorous Life"". ""Romance 1600"" is one her greatest recordings to date. Sheila shares her talented percussion best on tracks such as Sister Fate and Romance 1600. A Love Bizarre is as funky today as it was in 1985. It makes you wanna pull out the old 80's gear and break dance. Bedtime Story is a song that should only be listen to in the company of a romantic friend. Her voice and slow melodic groove prove to be sensual, classy, and unique. If you are a fan of the beatiful E. please make this cd a part of your collection."
5,5 stars,5 star product amazing fit comfy i would highly recommend this to everyone that is interested in slippers....def worth the money
3,Order a size or two larger,I like these slippers but they run a size low in my opinion. I wear 10 but need 12's in these slippers as a US (NOT UK) 11 are small.I am having a hard time replacing these slippers as well through Shoes.com but amazon is running a a to z process for me. I will see then if the 12 size fit better for my 10 size foot.The bottoms are made of a leather and can be prone to absorption. Other than that they seem to stay on foot and make a great sheepskin slippers.
5,Uggs made a believer out of my man!,"My guy always boasted that he never wore slippers...didn't see a reason to in a world of plentiful socks. I convinced him, you'll not only wear these, you will love wearing them. He opened the package Christmas morning and has had them on ever since...except when he's on his way to the office! They're gorgeous and super comfortable."
5,Walking on heaven,These slippers fit great! Comfortable and warm! Very stylish and worth every penny. The leather style is the way to go.
4,Ugggggh,Nice looking. Good quality. Keeps my feet warm. the only thing I will criticize is the sole. It's thin and as a result the only padding you'll have is the shearling which isn't a lot of padding.
4,very pleased,"I bought these for my husband, he really likes them but he has a wide foot and they are a bit narrow for him. Hopefully they will stretch as he wears them."
5,Ugg Scuffs,"Through the years I've tried other brands of ""hang around the casa"" footwear, but always revert back to UGG as the brand makes the dogs happy. No slip tread, sheepskin lining that keeps your feet not only warm but dry and the fact that I can flick these suckers off in a heartbeat. Break in took a few minutes as the soles are rigid, but after that they feel like you're walking on air."
4,"Nice, nice indeed","A pick-and-mix from some of the leading breakbeat labels - Skint, Wall of Sound, Deconstruction. There are some classic tracks here... the Midfield General track is probably his best (and shows exactly why he's the Skint label boss). The Hardknox track, although a little dated, still rocks, as does the Monkey Mafia classic. Crystal Method sounds a little out of place here... and frankly I think everyone's a wee bit sick of that track anyway, but overall this is a handy compilation. You'll probably have a fair bit of the stuff on another CD already though..."
1,Too much hype with this book,"The problem is that men and women assume that a good looking person is by definition a good person to be with. That is the problem with this book. Why should a professional, successful man have to run after a good looking aerobics instructor and have to prove his worth? Who is out of whom's class here? Think a little more before you run out and by this book or any other book like it?"
5,CHANGED MY LIFE !!!,I have had this book for 3 months and I got more play than ever before. The honeys are all over me. I know now how to get into their mind. I even used the book on some corperate type women and the stuff works. My friends can not believe my skills.Man thanks for writing this book.
4,Outrageous! Revealing! Truths!,"Throughout the reading, I felt drawn to the author. I hope he has a book signing in the near future. I will be there! The author knows what women want! I didn't think there were any intuitive men left out there! From a female perspective, it was eye-opening and revealing. A.S."
1,A Complete Waste of Time,"This is the worst stuff I have ever read!Maybe the advice contained here was applicable at some time in the past, like pre-World War II thirties, but c'mon! The advice about being friends for up to two years before getting romantic? And when a relationship starts to get physical, it's time to get married??? Is this realistic? Does this author live in the present?Being the friend that the author advocates and doing the doormat favors that he suggests (e.g. sewing with her) is what women find unappealing. The male ""friends"" are the ones women cry to when other more pro-active, challenging guys give women a hard time or leave them confused.This book should be more appropriately titled ""How to be the doormat, friend type that women find unappealing."" Becoming the passive friend which the author advocates is contrary to why male readers probably bought this book in the first place."
1,"Become ""Just Friends"" with every woman you meet","Don't get me wrong - the author has a sense of ethics that I wish was echoed amongst people in all walks of life, whether seeking a companion or selling a car. Bravo.While proseletyzing on honesty, integrity, and compassion, the author expresses such an extreme fear of his own sexuality that he actually instructs NOT to express interest in being anything other than a ""friend."" Sorry, but I can speak from experience that this is a guaranteed and proven method for success at only making friends. And once you're a ""friend"", going beyond friendship and into romantic territory is, to a woman, like having sex with her brother.Might work for European royalty, but guess what? We're in 21st-century USA.Lots of ""!"" on the back of this book. Expresses my feeling rather well - ""I can't believe I paid real money for this book!""Run away. Go get ""How to Succeed With Women"" instead.T"
1,This is the BIGGEST piece of [junk] I've ever read!,"This book is worthless. With lines like ""baby sit her kids so that she can go out with the girls or what ever,"" says it all! What a joke! It's just laughable. If you buy this book, send me ten dollars, and I'll give you better advice."
5,Excellent for beginners,The perfect book for beginners: easy with clear screen shot illustrations of whatever task one wants to do.A person can easily learn the basics and go onto the more involved tasks with the assurance that you have an excellent guide to help you.If you are new to computers this is the ideal book to begin with.
3,Easy Microsoft Windows XP,"Covers only Home Edition, not whatI was looking for today. Wanted moreon XP Pro."
3,"The most readable, yet the least accurate of the books about this story.","After years with no books on this subject, all of a sudden three came along. This book is the most readable and personal of them all, with a bouncy tabloid style that grips far more than the more scholarly competition. Yet it is let down with a number of inaccuracies and misinterpretations that make it the least accurate of the books on the ""Mercury 13.""Better books to read to understand the true story are the excellentThe Mercury 13: The True Story of Thirteen Women and the Dream of Space Flight, the fascinatingRight Stuff, Wrong Sex: America's First Women in Space Program (Gender Relations in the American Experience)- and, most recommended, surprisingly,Into That Silent Sea: Trailblazers of the Space Era, 1961-1965 (Outward Odyssey: A People's History of S). The last book listed here manages to give a correct social, cultural and historical context to this story that all three of the other books lack."
5,Promised the Moon: The Untold Story of the First Women in the Space Race,Great read! Arrived in excellent condition and quickly
3,"Although a weak story line, characters were strongly developed","The book does not provide a good story, as expected. Her ""Shopaholic"" book was much better. The book was entertaining, but story lacked depth and complexity."
1,Just didn't like this one,"I've really liked several of Sophie's books, but this one just seems way too implausible. I find it unbelievable that a driven lawyer would chuck it all and be a maid even for a little while."
1,Where's the Fun?,"I was looking for some fluff, something with a sense of humor. This wasn't it. The book blurb makes it sound like fun. The cutesy-cover makes it look like fun. The tone of the writing make it sound like fun. I found no fun.I listened to 75 minutes of the 6.5 hour CD version of the book; during that time I didn't find one character that I was remotely interested in, nor did I ever crack a smile (even an inward one). Seriously, if you're supposed to be clever, funny, or even mildly witty, don't you think you ought to put some of that stuff in the first 20% of the book?I'm sure someone out there thinks this writer's stuff is hilarious. Wow, I SO did not. ::yawn::"
4,Looking for roots,"This book is very dense. It contains an enormous amount of history condensed (packed) - into 288 pages. It is difficult and tedious to read. Some paragraphs run on for a page and a half.It is well researched and lists 10 pages of references. It is not well indexed ( 6 pages ).It's greatest weakness is that it is very dry and poorly organized. It is organized in to ""periods"" but the periods are very long and within the periods there is no organization at all.Its strength is that it is cheap and if you can get through it, you will learn a lot. If you can't get through it, you will have a great reading list for your own research."
4,Family Guy continues with their shenanigans.,I love family guy a lot. I only gave it 4 stars because the new episodes (after they recovered from being canceled) just doesn't have the same kind of charm like it used to have. It's still a must-have DVD box set for any Family Guy fanatic.I can't wait for season five***
5,A Great Gift For the Fan,"I bought this set for my 38 year old son, who is a great fan of Family Guy. He loved it and has watched it multiple times."
2,Jumped the Shark this time around,"Used to be a good 10-20 belly laughs and episode, now only 2-3. I hope they get back on track, but I'll be renting the next set before I consider buying, unlike every set up to now."
5,Family Guy Volume 4 (the rest of Season 4),"Why is Amazon saying Season five when Season five of Family Guy just begin on Fox this month?Anyways it should be the rest of Season four minus The Stewie Griffin Untold Movie season finale.Yes, I will get this DVD since I'm a family Guy fan but Amazon should really fix the title...and call it Family Guy Volume 4 (Season Four). Why does Fox have to do Family Guy and American Dad in Volumes and The Simpsons and King of the Hill in season sets. I don't know"
4,Great season,I love this show and this season! I waits not happy at the condition at which I receiced the product. If it weren't for that I would rate 5 stars.
5,"As always, entertainment galore.","If you love Family Guy like we love Family Guy, then this is a must-add for your collection."
3,Family Guy Must be Hated by the FCC.,"Family Guy, Vol. 4 is extremely funny, but it has a problem. The show is in my opinion the new ""South Park"" with the families involved in it more. In one episode, Stewie tries to kill Brian by shooting him in the knees, bashing his head with glass, drownding him in a toilet, buring him, and then hitting him with a bat. Yah, I couldn't help laughing at this, but I still think it is a little over the top. Peter is also more dumb then normal and in a comedic way, voilent.-Ben Russell"
4,"Great Series, but there's something missing","Family Guy is a great show,but there is something missing this season.There is nothing that can remotely be called a solemn moment,unlike in previous seasons.And I'm talking about remotely.Probably the saddest moment in Family Guy is when Pearl Burton gets hit by the bus in Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows.I almost cried at the end,until the doctor came in and said,""Hey,who wants to see a dead body?"" Even though there is nothing like that this season,there is still plenty to laugh at.Stewie's fight with his evil half-brother Bertrom will leave you in stitches,as is Peter's attempt at founding a church dedicated to a certain bum from Happy Days (You know who I'm talking about.)If you like Family Guy,then pick up this season,you won't regret it."
2,great show horrible deal!!!!!!!!,beleive me i love family guy i think its hilarious but what annoys me is that they are selling seasons by the half! look at it this way a show like the simpsons can cost any where between $20 msrp to $50 msrp depending on the season so lets say the average simpsons season costs $35 when i buy the simpsons which is in my mind equally as good as family guy i get 25 episodes for $35 but when i buy family guy im getting 13 episodes for $40 it just doesnt make sence to me they are just trying to rip us off it honestley is not fair at all id rather by the simpsons
3,Less clever than previous seasons and more biting,"While there are still great episodes, this season has more personal slams, more biting, and less of the clever twists and alterations of current events and other outside shows. A little overdone on degrading various other groups - not with the clever humor of previous seasons but more sophmoric shock humor.Still has some quick laughs and twisted inserts that make Family Guy the fabulous show that it is."
4,Newer episodes not as great.,"First of all I would like to say that I LOVE Family Guy. I have watched it from the very beginning, and suffered during its hiatus. I have every episode that has ever been released on DVD and have their books / CDs. BUT, I am shamed to say that I no longer like Family Guy as much as I used to. These newer episodes are not nearly as funny as the first two (and even three) seasons. Now it seems as if Seth MacFarlane is struggling to be funny as his comedic stylings are growing dryer with each episode that he releases. I am dissapointed with this season, but am pleased with the entire series as a whole. If you're a big FG fan, go ahead and buy this. If you just heard about it and want to watch the show, buy the first two seasons. They cannot be beaten."
5,Family Guy Volume 4: Season 5,"This season is awesome. it is hilarious and outrageous. the best episodes in season five are1. PTV2. Brian Goes Back To Collage4. The Fat Guy Strangler5. The Father, The Son, And The Holy Fonz6. Brian Sings And Swings7. Patriot Games8. I Take Thee Quagmire9. Sibling Rivalry10. Deep Throats11. Peterotica12. You May Now Kiss The...Uh...13. Petergeist14. The Griffin Family Historyif you have not seen this episode then i recommend you do"
4,Great Show into a decent DVD,"I'm sure there's not much I can say that hasn't been said already, but for the most part this is one of the best DVDs I've purchased. I can't imagine someone not being familiar with the show by now. If you know the show, there's a good chance you love it and you'll be buying the DVDs anyway.My main complaint is that they split season 4 into two DVD sets when they could have just as easily made them a single set. My understanding of this has to do with the way the network originally split the season for broadcasting purposes but it's most likely another way to milk profits. The only other thing I'd like to see is an option to play all the episodes that skips the introduction credit sequences which gets old after the first couple times of hearing the theme song.Maybe they'll get the right with future DVDs?"
5,used book in good condition,"I received this used book in fairly good condition. The pages are a bit yellowed and some are dog eared, but none are falling out and the cover is still attached.I like this author and the theme of the white indian series. I have not checked on the veracity of the details given about native american indian culture nor the if some of the characters are actual historical figures or purely fiction, but it seems honest and is quite interseting; a good mix of drama, action, romance, and history. If you like historical fiction, give it a try."
4,Sammy Hagar - 'Loud & Clear' (BGO) 4 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1980,I assume this was a live album in support of his first six solo lp's. Similar to his 1982 'Red Hot' budget priced live offering (see my review), but a bit better I thought. Tunes that I found myself playing repeatedly were ""Red"", ""Rock 'N Roll Weekend"",""I've Done Everything For You"" and the two Montrose cuts here ""Bad Motor Scooter"" and ""Space Station #5"". A good vintage arena rock title. Line-up: Sammy Hagar-guitar&vocals, Bill Church-bass, Gary Phil-guitar&vocals, Alan Fitzgerald-keyboards and Denn Carmassi-drums. Recommended."
3,A good book with an difficult subject,"This is a heart-rending book to read. Although you may not get to know the characters Paul & Laura very well, you feel like you can know their struggle. Although it is interesting that throughout the book, there is usually one experience that is horrible for the couple, and then success, or something good happens. There was just something pollyanna-ish about the entire novel. That's not to say that it wasn't a good read, just be prepared.I think that there were things that good have been handled better. For instance, Vicki's story is boiled down into one small paragraph with little build up. Dialogue could have been better--not as stilted.All in all, I think this is a good book that deserves to be read by people trying to understand couples battling with infertility."
2,"Good information, poor fiction","The author tackles an important subject, but I was disappointed in his story. The characters seemed to be constantly angry with each other and with almost everyone else. This couple never expressed any affection for each other, and I never felt any sympathy for them. The medical profession was painted as almost completely uncaring. We all have problems with doctors, but they are not universally bad. If the reader is interested in a book that details some of the very real problems of childlessness, this book probably presents accurate information. However, as far as fiction goes, it is not an entertaining read."

4,Early Success,This cd is a early recording of the trio and it shows why The Three Sounds recorded so many LP's for Blue note records.This CD swings from beginning to end. It's worth the high price tag in my opinion.
5,Beautiful flower girl dress!,"I bought this dress for our flowergirl and the picture truly does not do it justice. The quality of the dress exceeded my expectations. The flower petals on the bottom are loose under the tulle layer, so they sort of ""float"". Our flowergirl loved skipping and spinning around to make the petals swish. The material on top is iridescent and catches the light beautifully. The pearl buttons and sash tie on the back are also wonderful touches. To top it all off, the dress is ""Made in USA""."
1,Broken,Item Arrived broken. Plastic end cap was loose and fell off. product appeared to be cheaply made. Power pack is a light blue color. Wires probably to short for some cases.
5,Great,Product came right away. I bought two in the past and liked them so much I just bought two more for a different project. They work great for lighting up UV reactive accessories in the case. For sure recommend these to people looking for some cheap UV lights.
4,Works for small cases,"If you have a large case, look elsewhere or at least buy two sets. I have a full tower and two bulbs just wasn't enough. I didn't want huge lights in my case so I settled for a second set. Having four of these in a full tower works okay but if you go this route, make sure you place them wisely. The wires are VERY short!"
1,Complete Garbage.,"If it works perfectly then you are lucky. It will light up your case with a blue UV light that will make anything Neon Colored light up like a Christmas Tree. But the brand this is made by is so horrible I can't stand it. Mine only worked after super gluing the connectors to the cables after the cables fell out of the port. And that little blue box should never have been created. It converts the power so terribly and the connections are so horrid It makes me wonder if Sweatshop Labor was at work here.UPDATE: Wonderful, After only 2 hours of use. The only good working light I had died. Really After all that frustration, It dies. Now I have all this random crap in my computer i have to take out. Worst product ever."
1,Great Idea -- Poor Design,"My niece suffered a stroke and lost the use of her right arm...I thought this would be great for her so I ordered it and brought it over to her house. We took it out of the package and put it together. There is a removable insert with spikes that when flipped upside down leaves the cutting board smooth, flipped upright and it holds food so that it can easily be cut. The insert is the problem...it takes 2 strong hands to pop it out and then back in again. So you can see how this is a problem..This is an expensive cutting board and could of been made much better. Very disappointed. BEWARE if you are buying from HPMS, Inc not only will you pay return shipping fees, you will pay for the original shipping and at least a 20% restocking fee. I would suggest finding another seller that has buyer friendly returns if you would like to try your luck with this product!"
2,ombre rose,"the product arrived as promised. However, it seems to be old, as the toilette seems to be sharp and not as should be"
3,disappointed,"This is the first time that I ordered Ombre Rose, and it was not true to the scent of Ombre Rose! I was very disappointed as Ombre Rose is my favorite Scent of all time. And it's not I've forgotten what it smells like, I have the perfume and shower gel, this smells very different and I can not return it! Generally everything else I've ordered thru Amazon has been just as ordered."
5,A double dose of some great stuff...,"I reviewed the Not Shy CD awhile back, but the pairing of Walter Egan's first 2 albums on one CD can only be described with one word. ""Perfect!"" If listening to these two great albums doesn't put a smile on your face, then I don't know what will. Walter brings out the best in Lindsey Buckingham & Stevie Nicks and vice versa. For the three of them to have produced albums this excellent is just too good...I'll leave it at that and just say ""enjoy"" because in my humble opinion, it's just about impossible NOT to enjoy this stuff! Many thumbs up to whoever finally had the idea to put these two albums out together!!!"
4,An accurate portrayal,"An objective and accurate portrayal of radical Islam in America. Once one reads this book, it becomes obvious that many in the media and academic circles are living in a whitewashed world of denial. Radical Islam is a very real threat. And it's here and now.To learn about what goes on at an Islamic convention in a Texas Hilton Hotel and to learn where the monies go from ""mainstream"" Islamic charities, read this book."
4,Eye opener,"This book, although I knew about some examples of Militants in America, was a real wake up call. The examples Emerson uses are mind boggling. Very interesting read and well written. This book will reiterate things most know but will also give some for-instances that many may not know."
1,"Poor writing, poorer strategy","Sadly, this book does little but add to the growing library of scaremongering, deceptive political ""analysis."" Its attempt at demonizing a political party that includes many the people that it accuses said party of reviling (Women, Gays, Racial Minorities; Just look at The Clare Luce Booth Institute, GOProud, the Black Conservative Coalition) proves that the liberal end of the political spectrum in America has either A) Not done its research or B) Doesn't think that women, homosexuals, and minorities are capable of having independent thoughts."
1,FactChecker,"Read John Sugg's June 12, 2003 column in Creative Loafing if you want an example of Steven Emerson's credibility (Hint: It ain't good)."
1,Steve Emerson is one of them,"""The Terrorists are among us"" he is right and Steve Emerson is one of them because he is spreading propaganda to create a terror from American Muslims. Don't you think if they were sleeper cells in the US they would have been woken up by now especially when Israel and the US government are doing much of the killing around the world (hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians). Sept 11 was ""not"" the work of 19 Muslim hijackers, do your research and you should find the truth, and the overwhelming evidence is on the internet. Don't depend on the US News media and bigots or so called experts like Steve Emerson for your information or you'll be in the dark and you would misinformed."
1,Save your money.,"I bought this CD on a whim because I couldn't find any reviews, good or bad, on the 'net. I should have saved my money. This CD does nothing to build on the cookie-cutter acid-jazz/funk recipe. It might work as source material for DJs to manipulate in a dance-floor situation, but listening to the CD as a whole is a chore and a half."
1,The worst condition period.,"The Anemone arrives without many of its tenacles. It was so old that its coloring was brown, nothing like its picture. I sent it back and was never refunded. The worst order ever."
1,waste of money,"broken on arrival, sticky resin material that was nothing like what I expected, doesn't move at all with water(a hard lump of junk) don't waste your money"
1,What rash67 said !,"After reading rash67's review I popped in my Best of/Sons of Mercury 1986-1975,AAD, by Bill Inglot to compare songs and now I'm thinking of tossing this new cd in the trash. Mona on this one is loud bass and fader guitar that's kind of disappointing to listen to. The background guitar is way back there almost gone. I'm going to try the import version like he suggests. This one was pain-full to listen to. SO I JUST RECEIVED THE REPERTOIRE ONE for $5.00 more and am now keeping the Capitol records recording and tossing this one in the trash. This one is even louder and jarring to listen to and makes the Capitol Records one sound good by comparison."
3,Moderately happy,"Competent, though inordinately cited classic psychedelic rock swings through fun covers, standard jams, and long head trips in a live show that was likely powerful to have witnessed but has retained little of its vitality throughout the decades."
2,"Not Bad, Just Pointless","It's not that this record is bad--though the title track is definitely that--but it is pointless. A bunch of live jams tacked onto some studio horseplay. I bought this disc after seeing it mentioned in a book about the 1,000 records/albums you need to hear before you die. Well, I've heard it."
2,EHH!!,"this cd has some absolutely low-spots.long drawnout almost silent spots,minutes in some areas.though there are a few places where the guitar is good,this cd is boring."
4,super but not excellent,"This album was great, but it didn't have some of the more famous songs like Fresh Air. I thought that the music, espicially the guitars were more excelent than they usually are. I would reccomend this album to people who know they already know they like Quicksilver, but if you're trying them out for the first time this may not be the one for you. This one is great for people that already like the band, because it introduces songs that aren't as popular, so there is more of a variety from their other albums. But overall, this is a great album. And my entire family likes to listen to it. My dad listens to Tony Bennett, my mom the Stones, and me Home Grown, but we all agree that this is a great album, espicially for long car rides."
3,Fresh Air?,"Well I will go against the current here. I listened and owned the original LP and this CD is missing the all important ""...take another hit of fresh air"" which I miss and should have been included in this CD! Who wants to buy a ""Best of"" CD, those are just not the same. Too bad as this was one of the best LPs in my former collection."
2,Mostly Underwhelmed,"Having read several reviews after purchasing and listening to this thing I have to say I am mystified by the devotion and false hoopla this cd has generated. Parts of it are worthy of a second listening but much of it is some of the most boring tripe put to record - not avant-garde or ahead-of-it's-time or even very good psychedelia. Just tired old hippie-stoner droning drivel. Certainly it's devotees are lost in the foggy halcyon days of yore, fondly remembering their first time listening to it - sitting around their dorm rooms high on hashish, which may have made this much more listenable. Perhaps I should try that!A very disappointing experience."
3,"Great Album, Crappy Sound","QMS has certainly gotten the short end of the stick from Capitol. This classic band's first two albums deserve to be remastered from the orginal tapes and presented in their full glory. Happy Trails is a five star album, but the sound of this CD is two star. This is a disgrace. They deserve better."
4,REMASTERED OR JUST RE-EQUALIZED?,"I own both the U.S. and the the ""restored & remastered"" Repertoire version of this classic live recording. It may boil down to a matter of personal taste, but I found the Repertoire CD to be bass-heavy, and the recording as a whole not to be any clearer than the U.S. CD. I doubt that the original master tapes were used by ""EROC at the Ranch."" I also doubt that 24 bit digital remastering was used, as was in Capitol's 2002 ""CLASSIC MASTERS"" QMS compilation. I will, however, commend Repertoire for its excellent booklet. It's a shame that neither Capitol nor Rhino has seen fit to put out a definitive remaster this timeless CD."
4,Quicksilver Messenger Service,"A great glimpse back to the acid rock days of the early seventies. One side devoted to Bo Diddly's ""Who do you Love?"". Some great guitar work."
4,happy trails,"Happy trails refers to the fact that some or all of the band and crowd were stoned or on acid. The long pause on side a is amazing because they were so blown out after the intro they had to regroup. That they could ""finish"" the jam at all is amazing. Listen to QMS first lp and dig on gold and silver."
5,Great Blues-Psychedelia,"This is one of my absolute favorite psychedelic albums, its in the same spirit as Ummagumma by Pink Floyd in that both albums are both half LIVE and half studio and of course they are both psychedelic! The guitar in this album is top notch, absolutely excellent, its definitley in the same league as Hendrix and Claptton. I love the long spacey songs and quickry, slightly creepy solos and the lyrics are pretty funny, the last song ""Happy Trails"" is a prime example. Anyways this is a great album and definitley one of the best acid rock albums EVER! If you enjoy psychedelic music and slightly country tinged blues rock than this is a great buy!"
5,5 For Perfomace... 3 For Sound...,"Too be fair... If you compare this poor Capitol release with the ""Repertoire"" re-master ""MOST PEOPLE"" will right away notice more depth and clarity in the sound.I actually believe Capitol mastered this version from an LP, as there are a few times you can noticeably hear some snap, crackle, pops that aren'tIf you really want to truly enjoy this...PICK UP THE... Repertoire #ASIN: B00004TKAQ version of this kiddies...It sounds the best!!!Buy & Enjoy... mDbtw... Kudos to rash67 for his insight on this version... He was right on!"
5,Thanks Las Vegas Dude,Thanks much on the heads up on the Cd version of QMS live Happy Trails review. Have this on old cassette that has seen or played better days and it still probably sounds better than the CDS you purchased. Noticed there are quite a few out there that are that way
2,Severely Overrated!!!,"It seems that a lot of the folks reviewing this CD still spend a lot of time with with their bongs. Yes, it's a pretty good record. But a little of the Bo Diddley beat goes a long way, and 30 plus minutes of it overstays its welcome. And for my money, Gary Duncan cuts John Cipollina to shreds; John's OVERUSE of the whammy bar takes a lot away from his playing. The cd's ""Quicksilver"" and ""Comin' Thru"" are much better than this one. I recommend this for completists only......"
1,Sleepy Trails,"Damn nice cover art. After that it goes down hill.I guess you had to be there ? Long periods of absolutely nothing as in no sound! I actualy fell asleep the first time I listened to it ! Maybe if I got stoned before I listened to it , it would have been just like being in the audience in the old days ."
4,Good product,Received my order of Bondhus GorillaGrip Triple Pack.While I have not heard of Bondhus I am impressed by their products. Each fold-up set is very well-made of quality material. Each set is heavy. They feel very solid in the hand.I have not yet used any of the set but I have no doubt that they will perform well.The triple set means that 90% of my hex/star needs are met.
5,gorilla grip combo pack by bondhus,All 3 drivers have held up to some light use so far. The black coating is pretty good at resisting rust. USA made.
5,Big Voice From A Big Star!,"This is Hilary Duff's CD single for her song, ""Little Voice,"" which is the fourth song on her sophomore CD, Metamorphosis. Thesong is amazing and am glad that they made a single of this! Tosay, I am a huge fan of Hilary Duff, especially her music. I don't know how I could live if Hilary never hit this planet! Shehas the sexiest look in Hollywood, and is ultra-kind. She is involved in Kids With A Cause, and a strong animal rights advocate, along with Lizzie McGuire stars Ashlie Bruillalt (Kate) and Clayton Snyders (Ethan). This is a simply brilliant hit from Ms. Duff, and she definitley does NOT have a little voice! This album also has a dance remix of her hit, ""Party Up,""which is the tenth track on ""Metamorphosis."" Not having this album, however, I do not know how the remix sounds, but I lovethe original, that's for sure! Be sure to look for Hilary Duff'snew release, ""Most Wanted,"" featuring the hit ""Wake Up,"" thisAugust!"
4,"Not ""Little Voice,"" Big Voice!","This song ""Little Voice"" is straight off Hilary's Metamorphosis CD which rocks by the way. Little Voice is actually the best on the album, which makes this one rockin' too. Party Up is a wonderful song also. (except for last verse)But you're better off with Metamorphosis anyway."
4,An modern historical overview of the martial arts .,"This book is really a modern historical overview of the martial arts .I say ""modern"" because it is a ""martial arts today"" book . I love the fact that the chapters are divided up according to styles or teachers. Its a book that give serious martial artists a broad overview of Robert Smith's journey in the martial arts. GoodChoice."
4,Overall I'd rate this a very good read,Robert Smith does inject his own personalbias in a few areas which is something Ican accept because he does such a greatjob overall.Overall I'd rate this a very good read andfills in a lot of gaps for martial artshistorians and puts many things and peopleinto perspective.
1,Mean Spirited,"Smiths writing and insight are tops as his past works have shown however. In this book it seems as if Mr. Smith was giving a blank check to write anything he felt about anyone whom he has had a disagreement with over the course of the past 50 years.The book starts off well enough with insights into how he got started in his training and some very colorfull stories of early Judo both in the United States and Japan. But, from mid way on Smith takes the opportunity to degrade many who deserve better. It also seems as if Mr. Smith has a fixation with Chinese Tai Chi players and anyone not in this camp is secondary at best. Yes, some of his observations are true but many others seem as if he is simply trying to settle old scores without any means of defense from those to whom his comments are directed.Over all it would have been a great read if it focused more on the history he experienced. Sadly enough though it dosen't. I give it a one star because of this."
1,Avoid,"Anyone who says that Muhammad Ali was an overweight light-heavyweight with the punch of a pillow and couldn't stand with the earlier heavyweights (who incidentally were smaller than Ali,""an overweight light-heavy"")should not have there opinions on fighting arts taken seriously."
2,"It's tiny and thin, but pretty!","You cannot tell from the pic, but this is really small and thin. It is not really functional as a notebook. It's pretty small and thin. Be warned."
4,good,It's pretty small and its great to fit in a purse but if you need it for school I don't recommend buying this
2,Cute but TINY,"This notebook, while very pretty, is not really functional. It is only about 4 x 5 inches. The pages inside are blank."
2,Tiny,"I was disappointed in this note book, it was tiny and the cover was not printed clearly.I would save the $1.50 and go to the dollar store where you could get 3 for the same price."
2,notebook not for writing but for drawing or doodling,"the word notebook is misleading because notebook means writing pad pages.the cover is beautiful, that's the 2nd reason i bought it.i am not a art or doodle guy, so the so called notebook was useless to me.the binding was great and blank pages was great quality.great quality notebook for price, compared to problems with cheap notebooks."
4,Great Stocking Stuffer,These are great little books for stocking stuffers. Definitely decorative and catch the eye. As far as functional I don't know as I gave the ones I bought away as stocking stuffers.
5,great book,"I really found this book to be a great beginner book. I've knit for years, but my daughter hadn't, so when she had a problem with a pattern in the book, I bought it to help her. She was reading ahead instead of following the pattern and knitting as she went. The project are well thought out and well written. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn to knit."
4,Clever Ideas,The book had some very clever Ideas. A bit too many using math tiles. I dont really enjoy them but there were enough other idea to balance it out.
2,Teacher book,"Maybe, I have been teaching too long but I did not find many new Ideas for introducing key concepts. I was searching for some concrete examples, not the traditional ones suggested in the book."
2,Meh,"Not a bad book, per se, but it was used in a graduate class. This book would be much better suited for high school kids."
4,It's Getting Better...Even after 11 Editions.,Well-written and unique among child development books.Bee & Roberts do it again by updating this text with information (i.e. the Theories of the Mind section) that you won't find in many other competitors.Rosiland Childworth's CHILD DEVELOPMENT and Jeffrey Trawick-Smith's EARLY CHILD DEVELOPMENT are excellent texts if you can't get this one...but this one does a more thorough job of injecting many little details and nuances that stem straight from the primary literary sources of many of the theories.Great!
2,Disappoited,"It was extremely used with bent cover ends and pages stuck together, there was a slash across the front cover and what looked like water stain on the pages when the book was closed. Very disappointed with this purchase"
5,It takes the best of Vegas and brings it to the next level.,"Keep Hope Alive takes all of the best, most exciting elements from Crystal Method's Vegas, and cranks up the volume. All of the fast, trippy action heard on the full album is here, but only with higher intensity. Any fan of Vegas is going to find themselves right at home with this single."
3,Worth it to me for track 5,"The rest of the disc is lame but ohhh, the dubelicious groove spanish fly mix track FIVE -- a slow, dark and sexy groove caressed with spanish vocals a la femme ... buy it for that!! ((unless of course you ONLY want electronica you can dance to))"
4,Track 5 is Killer,"If you buy this CD for track 5 only (""Dubeliscious Groove""), it is worth the green. But tracks 2, 3, and 4 are also great remixes of previous TCM cuts. There are some fantastic, intelligently done grooves on those tracks. If you call yourself a TCM fan, or any kind of lover of boom 'n doom techno, then you gotta have this CD."
3,Kickin' song and mixes,"This is the great song that was in the title sequence of the Replacement Killers (Chow Yung Fatt). It is a bit expensive for a single that is not even an import, but you get your time worth with this single, each remix is 5-7 minutes long! For the price of this single, you can just go purchase the Vegas CD which has Keep Hope Alive on it."
4,Huck Finn's alive and well!,"Most of us harbor a secret lttle dream, running away - to a circus, a south sea island or our own special retreat. Well Dennis did, run away that is. This book describes his departure from ""normal"" life in Tennessee to pursue his dream of ""living on an island without a bridge"". During that process, he began writting newsletters to his friends - those newsletters eventually became this book. Dennis, with perpetually itchy feet, decribes the various jobs he has held in the various parts of the country he has lived in. Aways revolving around boats and scuba diving, the narratives are focused on how the ""other half"" lives. Sometimes a little qirky but always entertaining!"
2,Not his best.,Larry Sparks normally produces bluegrass that has some feel to it. This CD never seemed to connect with me and he sounds really tired on the recordings.
3,Subtract a star if you have read anything else on creativity,"At best, half this book directly involves collaboration. The half that doesn't is handled in a much more interesting way by Mike Michalko and others in the field. Also, to say that there are 72 essays is very misleading- many of these 'essays' are three paragraphs long and one is only three sentances. There are some good things in here, and Ricchiuto is probably a very good consultant, but I have to agree with the reviewer who said most of it is not really very new."
2,Average,"I have yet to read a good book about collarboration, with the exeception of ""When Sparks Fly"" published by the Harvard Business Review. This book, like many others, rehashes the same old stuff."
4,V2 Supporter,"My doctor recommended this product because of my vulvar varicosities and although it seemed weird at first, it has helped ease the pain of the veins. I do find it hard to wear all the time, but if I did, I think it would relieve my pain. I tend to put it on after the pain is already there and that doesn't help as much."
4,PHEWIE!!!!!!!!,"This product has been wonderful. It has eliminated almost all of the throbbing and ""hanging out"" feeling usually associated with this uncomfortable condition.By the end of the day I used be beside myself with discomfort but now I can comfortably stand up and walk for long periods of time without too much discomfort at the end of the day.It seems to also support my pubic bone, making me feel more secure while moving around.The only CON would be the terrible panty-line you get as a result of the two straps at the back. A small price to pay but it does look like I have 4 butt cheeks in some pants!!"
2,Not helpful,"I was hopeful that this product would help alleviate the pain and itching that I was experiencing. Unfortunately, the uncomfortable nature of the belt far outweighed any benefits this product may have had. I wore it for one day and then decided that I would rather deal with the pain than keep readjusting every time I moved. And past reviews are correct - you can really only wear this product with jeans, as it does give a ""four cheeks"" look, as well as creating a muffin top I never had."
1,Uncomfortable. Feels like a jock strap for women,I purchased this along with the Prenatal Cradle. I returned this product b/c it was very uncomfortable to wear. I also didn't feel much relief. The Prenatal Cradle has provided the pelvic relief I needed and is very comfortable to wear.
2,not sure about this one,"I'm not so sure how well this V2 supporter works because it was so uncomfortable that I sent it back immediately. I am a stay at home mom on my third pregnancy so I am up and down throughout the day. I have a bulging vericose vein in my right groin and my Dr. recommended this product to try to help provide support. I'm not sure if it wouldn't help if you had to be on your feet all day but it is quite uncomfortable to have on if you are sitting and since it goes over your underwear but under pants, you can't get it off easily enough. I needed something that was supportive while standing but that could be removed easily when sitting. I use a supportive waist belt when I'm on my feet that works great for me."
3,supporter,"A supporter like this was recommended by an ob-gyn Doctor. Neither she (nor am I) are pregnant, but it was recommended it be worn during exercise to help hold the bladder up. The doctor said she never exercises without it. It seems to work real well by giving a little extra support. I guess my only complaint is the price. I'd like to have two of these but just the one is beyond my budget."
3,It's better than nothing,"At 34 weeks I needed something to help relieve the pelvic pressure and pain I was experiencing every time I got up or while I'm walking around. After reading so many reviews, I finally decide to commit to buying it eventhoguh I was a little skeptical. At first I felt like I was wearing a man's jockey strap or a sumo wrestler item, but I did feel some support. It's a little tricky because you have to adjust the straps correctly and make sure it doesn't stick out or your going to feel it rub against your skin. It's okay. It does alleviate some of the pain, but not entirely. My only complaint is that you can see the bumpy straps through your pants or dress. People will know you are wearing these because it doesn't lay flat on your body. I had to wear a long sweater over my pants so it wouldn't be noticeable."
2,There are better products on the market.,I ordered this product and then a friend suggested another product to me. I received the other product in 2 business days and it provided maximum support for me. This product provides minimal support for mom's with pelvic and venous pain related to pregnancy. Other reviews say that this product changed their life. I do not find this to be true about this product.
4,Saves me from a lot of pain,"Okay so I had varicose veins down there since my 4th month of pregnancy, and I could barely stand for a minute. My doctor recommended something that would lift everything up, and I searched the internet and found this V supporter. When you first start wearing it, it helps tremendously w/ the pain, but since it doesn't give much, it's not very comfortable while you sit or wear it for long periods of time. But it's better than the alternative of not wearing one at all. Now that I'm in my 8th month, I basically never take it off. I'm either used to how restrictive it is, or maybe it's started to give a little bit in the waistline (I was previously 125 lbs, now 153 lbs) so it's not that uncomfy anymore. The only thing is that I wished it came in black or nude, it tends to pick up pieces of dark fuzz from my clothes, and looks dirty even though I wash it. And you can't wear anything too tight over it, bc the straps in the back show as indentations in your garments."
3,"Works well, size is off...","Overall product works well for its purpose, but the fit is not right. I followed the weight and size chart and when I recieved the product it was too small. I had to cut the elastic and sew in some extra to make it fit right. I would recommend ordering a size larger that what it says. After I adjusted it to fit right I found that the product worked very well and relieved my discomfort."
4,"Here's more size info, had to jury rig mine, but it DOES work","Here's additional sizing info from the package: Hip Measurements:Petite - <28"", Small - 28 to 36"", Medium - 37 to 44"", Large 45-54"".If you don't need extreme hip compression, get a size bigger. I had to cut the hipband open in the back as it caused hip pain for me. I inserted about 8"" of velcro to close the band in back. It holds hardly any tension across the back anymore, but it still provides compression in the desired area."
3,Great sound but lousy fit,"If you like tight bass, you'll love these headphones. They sound great with electronic music, rock, and rap/hip-hop because of their bass punch.The downside is that they're really tight fitting on both the ears and top of the head.The trick is to stretch them over something for a couple of days to loosen the pressure on the ears. The top is pretty short and can press down on the top of the head. To relieve that pressure, face the headphones together and squeeze the top near the ""AKG"" stamp on the head strap to make a bit of a ""conehead"" shape. Alternatively, you can just wear them with the head strap behind the head.It takes some effort, but they can become comfortable."
3,"Twisty, Curly Cord will Break leaving you with sound in one ear","My second AKG 81 DJ just stopped working for the same reason as the first, the cord have a tendency to twist and curl up after the Y section and after a while it breaks leaving you with sound in only one ear. I tried everything to prevent this but with no luck.Sound wise it was OK, it's perfect when the sound is being driven by a powerful amp but with my MP3 player the base was on the low side, the mid and highs were OK. I don't like to share my music with people around me and this headphone prevents sound pollution regardless of volume levels.I like these headphones but I am tired of fighting with the cord to prevent it from twisting and I am tired of replacing it."
5,awsome sound,"Have had them for 2 years now:PROS-Very good isolation from outside noise while being not actively noise cancelled.-Really crisp on the mid-high to high range.-You can turn up the basses, they won't distort.-Confortable to wear.-Great for DJing as well as for iPod or MP3 player.CONS-Had the same problem with the cord as reviewed before, it internally broke. This might not happen if handled with care, I did not I must admit. Just in my case I fixed it myself replacing the cord, now they sound like new ;-)OVERALLGreat phones totally worth their price."
4,Great,"I purchased these headphones because they were the best sound quality for the money and were also efficient enough to run with an MP3 player. I have not been disappointed, they sound very good, though not perfect. They have only 2 drawbacks. The bass is a little weak for me and then they come, they didn't fit me right. When it starts getting into loser decibel levels it starts to distort a little bit. Fairly minor flaws, especially since the fit can be fixed in about a day if you leave them to stretch out."
2,Great while it lasted,"The first six weeks that I owned the headphone were wonderful. I have never experienced such full, outstanding sound quality at this price point, particularly the strong bass. I liked the snug fit too. Sadly the left channel suddenly stopped working a few nights ago.I have taken good care of this device (it hasn't suffered any trauma) so I am quite disappointed by this turn of events. After careful consideration I have decided to look to another make for a replacement."
3,"Sound great, but...","I love the sound these have, and the price point. But, after owning them for a couple of years, the ear pads are starting to fall apart. the outer, faux leather layer is peeling off. i also owned a pair of AKG K 401's, and the same thing happened to them, too. I don't think I'll be risking a third AKG purchase."
4,Great headphones for the price,These headphones are well worth the money. I found that after extensive periods of use (over 1hr at a time) my ears would hurt from the pressure of the headphone cups. I was impressed by the bass quality of the headphones but the treble quality was not as good as my sennheiser HD448. I would purchase these headphones again.
1,Design Defect on headphone plug,Worked perfectly for about 4 months until the right headphone stopped producing sound.The design of the plug makes the wires naturally prone to shorting after a time of pulling the headphones out of the jack. If I knew the first thing about electronics or soldering I would try to fix it myself. All I can say is that there is a VERY good chance your pair will meet the same fate withing the first 6 months of owning these. The design is just plain flawed.
3,Fragile Cord...,"I bought these about five months ago, and while I agree that the headphones were tight around the head when I first bought them, they loosened up a while ago. I found no problems with the sound - the quality was as expected. However, I've been using them for day to day to and from work portable use - and the cord is simply not built to withstand that kind of use. Recently the right speaker just gave out, and with some fiddling while connected to some music, it is evident that the cord connection to the plug is loose and faulty. As stated earlier, not replaceable. Perhaps these are good for home use, but I don't recommend them if you're using them as you travel around town."
3,Great for music but NOT for movie listening.,"I bought these for listening to my home theater. Bad choice!I listened to music and must say these can't be beat for that. The bass is tight!If you are thinking about buying these for listening to TV then go to something else.If you want to listen to music then these are a ""Must have"".My teen daughter tried these with her music system and was blown away so I gave them to her.Also if you have a fat head like me then avoid these.These are not ""Over the ear"" cans but more like ""flush with the ear""."
3,They ok for listening,These head phones are comfortable and good for just listening to music and movies. But they are not noise canceling nor would i recommend them to the serious DJ or sound engineer.
1,Crap,"First off, I was amazed by these headphones- nice fit, good style, decent sound.BUT, for all it's worth, these headphones are crap. After roughly a week of use, the sound to the right speaker simply disappeared. No amount of jiggling the cord would yield any results, and last time I checked the solder on the speaker itself was intact.If you decide to waste $65 on this, be prepared for bitter disappointment."
3,sounds good but uncomfortable,"I won't talk about the sound much. I got it because it's efficient enough to be used with a portable digital player. The sound is fine (not the best but fine, very good bass at slight expense of clarity).The problem is that the headband isn't cushioned. It gets painful after a few minutes of wear. I have to move the headband (I have a small head yet I have it extended almost all the way so it won't put too much weight on my head). I have to look for another pair now just for this reason.The cable is very long. Obviously it's not intended to be a potable-digital-player headphone."
4,Good Headphones for the Price,"I really love these headphones. I get SO many compliments on them (good conversation starter) and they have great sound quality for the price. The only thing is that they are a bit uncomfortable in long-term situations and they make my ears a bit hot/sweaty, but that's really the only drawback. I left them open around my boots overnight to stretch them out, too, since my head is kind of big for these.In general, though, these are definitely a good buy. I haven't had any problems yet."
1,Technical Specs Wrong,"If the frequency range is important to you, DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES.If you're looking to use them for something like Centerpointe's Holosync cds, these will not work for you.The advertised frequency range, when I bought these headphones, was 5-30,000 Hz. When the package arrived, the frequency range on the package reads 16-24,000 Hz.Fortunately, I caught that before I opened the package, so Amazon was very good about the return, and even paid for the return postage, since it's their website that's wrong."
3,Good sound; comfort depends on the head.,"I enjoyed the sound quality, it was clear with distinct bass, ambient sound was remarkably attenuated. Unfortunately I had to return these headphones because they simply could not fit me well. My head is a bit on the large tall side, and even with the headband fully extended the headphones sat too highly on the ears. Since these headphones are pretty tight, needless to say it was not possible for me to wear them comfortably for extended periods of time.All in all, it is a decent product with very good sound, but you will probably like it a great deal better if you have a smaller head and are okay with tight headphones."
5,Fantastic headphones. A drummer's dream.,"These headphones are absolutely perfect for me. I listen to lots of low-end metal (post-metal, doom metal, etc) and also black metal. I also listen to lots of post-rock. I couldn't ask for a better set of headphones at such an affordable price. They're quite heavy on the bass, so if you don't like much bass, stay clear of these.My favourite part, tough, is the noise-cancelling pads. Those are perfect for me, as I can hear my music totally clearly when I'm playing drums along with my iPod, trying to learn songs. The sound is crystal-clear and very, very nice.They also come with an adapter that you screw on to the 1/8 inch input to make it 1/4 inch (to plug into a keyboard, mixer, etc.)I highly recommend these to anyone looking for some great headphones at an affordable price."
2,Headaches,"Great sound, but the problem is that if you are using this for more than 20 minutes. it hurts your ears."
3,Buy Buy!,"I felt the album was very positive, my main inspiration was easy, ""YEAH!"", to all artists that supported In Defense of Animals, my main reason for buying the CD, with my support to the organization and the album itself, it was worthwhile. Thanks for the compassion."
5,A Saving Grace!,"From the first prayer to the last, Grip the Rope is a saving grace for not just single mothers or parents, but everyone. In a world where there seems to not be enough hours in the day; and meetings, deadlines and ringing telephones become our priority, Carla Curtis definitely lays the groundwork for a disciplined prayer life that puts the focus back on God. With simple, spirit-inspired prayers that run the gamut from anxiety and faith to goals and time-management, she reassures us that with prayer and a willing heart, we can and will survive, if we don't let go of God. This is a highly recommended book that should grace the shelves of every home library."
5,Grip The Rope: Prayers for Single Mothers,"I was absolutely elated by the word usage in this book. So often as Christian sinlge mothers, we are so worn down that we can only communicate in the simplest forms of words. Our cry for help is no different. As a church leader of a single parents ministry I found many suffering because of this. Life reduces us to the lowest common denominator and we feel that is not enough to come to God with to seek his help. But this book of heart wrenching pleas(prayers) to God, lets us know differently. It gives us new meaning to the phrase ""Hold onto God's Unchanging Hand"". Simply put it is, Grip the Rope!!!"
2,PACKAGING Mummy Trilogy [Blu-ray] ASIN B0053FANS6,Good movies. PACKAGING is just 1 standard 12mm blu-ray case with 3 disc inside. THIS IS NOT the edition with 3 blu-ray cases and a nice slipcover...
4,My Wife Made Me Buy This Trilogy,Okay! I bought it and liked it. Lots of action to these movies. Great audio and video. I think next time I get a series of movies like these I will not watch them one-after-the-other. After watching too much at one time I feel that I was exhausted with the Mummy theme after I started watching the third movie. I suggest giving each movie a breather before watching the next movie with a fresh start.
5,the Mummy Trilogy,it had all the mummy movies in it and with buying the scorpion king 1 movie too i finished them all out
1,"sheer disappointment! received - won't not play on our Sony BR -new, factory sealed, not used.","wish I could - my copy, bought as new, factory sealed - not used edition won't play on my Sony BluRay!! No confidence in issuance to re-order and gothrough more hassle."
1,never received item,Can't really rate this item. The seller I purchased this from never sent me my order and only refunded me partial payment and wouldn't refund the rest much less he/she never responded to my emails. Very disappointing.
4,"Good trilogy I think, kids not too interested though",I got this for my kids who I thought would love it being such fans of the Universal Studios ride based on it. Not so much. I liked them though.
1,No Audio on PS3,"If you plan on viewing this on a PS3, buyer beware. It does not have audio. Read the other reviews and decide if this is worth it. We tried all the DVDs in the trilogy and there is no audio during the film, only when you fast forward it. The bonus features do have audio, as well as the menu, but that was not really why we bought it. We tried updating our player to see if that helped, sadly it did not. Hopefully I can return this; we bought it at best buy."
2,Incompatible with Sony Playstation 3 (PS3),"This Blu-Ray is incompatible with Sony PS3 Blu-Ray Player. On some units, it will not produce audio. On others, it won't load at all. Disc loaded fine on two non Sony Blu Ray players, but even with the newest firmware, the PS3 would not play this disc properly if at all."
1,Faux Blu-Ray,Another set of Blu-Ray Discs with DVD audio. Why bother. The Movies are good but DVD is cheaper than Blu-Ray. You buy Blu-Ray because the audio is the best AV format full HD and audio formats at the top of the list ie Dolby True HD or DTS Master. Otherwise save your money buy DVDs not these false Blu-Rays.
5,Movies you can watch over and over and still enjoy,"I love these movies and have watched them over and over. These movies have everything, action, romance, comedy and great looking stars. What more could you ask for."
5,great collection,"If you love movies, i suggest getting ""The Mummy Trilogy"" on Blu-Ray....Great movies.The transfer to Blu-Ray is fantastic, great collection to my movies....HI-DEF is the way to go...Works great on my PS3."
4,First 2 movies rocked and 3rd was bad....,The first 2 movies were awesome and will be classics. The 3rd movie was bad and kind of stupid. Its the only reason I didnt give it 5 stars.
1,Not what was ordered,"I originally ordered the unrated version, but got the PG instead. I Already had unrated on DVD, but wanted Blu-Ray"
5,Kids love it!,"It's the only booster seat that I feel comfortable bringing to someone else's house. It won't scratch the furniture. I use it for my 20 month old and my 5 year old. They both love their seat and want to take it with them when we go on visits. They don't want to sit in those plastic, awkward booster seats. My favorite part about this seat is that it cleans like a breeze - no more trying to get into those impossible crevices, holes and folds. Plus they have beautiful color options, kids can't catch their fingers into a ""snapping/folding thing"" and you don't have to wrestle with a ""snapping/folding thing"". My daughter even used hers to watch TV when she was visiting her grandparents."
2,Beware if used on leather chairs,"I love how this booster fits in my chairs and my daughter thinks it is very comfortable, but BEWARE...There is white text on the bottom of the booster and it has rubbed off on my leather chairs. I managed to remove it from my chairs the first time, but the second time I couldn't get it all off so now you see white text on my chairs. I tried covering the text on the booster with clear packing tape, which worked pretty well until my toddler discovered it and kept ripping it off. Now it sits in our garage. What a waste."
4,Love this seat!!,"Someone gave me a blue one for my son who needed a booster seat at the table after he was too big for the high chair and he LOVES it. So, when our little girl graduated from the high chair, I ordered her this pink one. It is so easy to clean and they actually stick to the chair because of the material it is made out of and does not slide around like other booster seats therefore there are not straps you have to try to figure out. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because there are no safety straps to keep them from getting out of the seat like in the high chair, but, after time, they have learned that they cannot get up from the table before asking. It is easily portable to a restaurant or to someone's home, too. I think this is a fabulous item for yourself or as a gift!"
4,A great book,"This book is a great way for people to see how Hmong people see their life coming to America, and life before they came here. While reading the book I learned a lot, even though I am Hmong. The writers go into really deep details how living was and also how hard it was to adjust to America. Faderman also talks about how it was to be an immigrant, too. She compares most of the stuff Hmong people went through to her life as a child.This book really gives you an understanding of being Hmong. You'll learn how they lived before they came over to the United States. Then it'll talk about how hard it was to change their lives to live in the U.S. Who thought that someone would explain how Hmong people came here and how they lived? After reading this book, you'll be able to open your mind to other cultures. They did a great job of opening Hmong people to the whole world."
1,Don't buy this book - get Culture Shock! Thailand 2005 instead,"I was interested in this book until I read Robert Cooper's review. Now I will not buy it, and there are good reasons for you not to, either. Be sure to read his review for more information.1. Robert Cooper is the author of Culture Shock! Thailand, and uses his name on the review. I trust what he says is true - who would know better? - and he's putting his good name on the line.2. There is a newly revised version of CS! T for 2005. Culture Smart! is older, does not have the revisions.3. The definitive, updated, newly redesigned Culture Shock! Thailand for 2005 is about the same price as this out-of-date copy, and you can get an earlier edition (with similar text to this one?) for substantially less if money is tight."
2,"Good info, bad writing","This book contains good information and some very interesting hypotheses about how human emotions evolved. Unfortunately it is terribly written. It is very unclear at times, using scientific jargon when common language would be much better. Ideas are poorly organized and main points are often simply repeated rather than bolstered with explanations and examples."
1,Couldn't get past the first chapter,"I have been told this story is good, but with all the foul language in the beginning I gave it up. Maybe these people used this language but it certainly didn't add anything to the plot. All it did for me was make me stop reading."
3,Too pricey,The information presented in the book is useful but can be found in many other technical writing books and style guides at less than half the price.
3,"Not for homebaking, No explanations lllore@hotmail.com","I was really disappointed with this book. Even though it offers a incredibly wide variety of desserts, it explains all of them too briefly (why ""step-by-step""?). You must know everything. Besides that, its glossary has general information. And it is not for homebakers since all the recipes are presented in very, very large quantities, perhaps for a restaurant. It is very tiresome to be dividing the recipe, not only one time, but two or three times! There are 16 color photos, it is true, but you must guess what desserts are pictured in it.(?)"
5,Our Faith is Evolving Each Day,"Higher Ground is geared toward women and faith struggles, but I think the underlining message is great for all. I watched it with a group and then again by myself. It is a reflective spiritual movie and makes you realize our faith is evolving each day. We all have see challenges and divine intervention like those experienced in the movie."
1,Misleading; Huge Disappointment,"This movie struck me within the first 10 minutes as one that was going to set my mind into a tailspin. I thought I was going to be watching a woman searching for her faith and belief and, instead, it was more about her inner search of whether she was a lesbian or just wanted someone other than her husband.I would not recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for any spiritual enlightenment."
1,absolutely HATED it,"No point to this movie at all, strange ""religious"" depiction and in the end you feel this woman was more lost than ever so what was the point. This ""church"" stifled her more than helped her and she floundered in the strangeness of what came off as those professing the faith. It was a waste of film, higher ground wasn't depicted, I would NEVER recommend it, I thought it was an embarrassment to believers. Better off viewing something like Courageous, that was real, honest, and had a point, and a very good message."
1,"""Sly"" jab at Christianity","Not a balanced view of Christianity, contrary to several reviewers' claims.The take is a typical ""Hollywood"" jab.I'm sick of this attitude towards Christians.Very sad how these ""progressive"" types have found a new religion in self, yet think they are so advanced. It's just an ancient weakness, or to use an ""offensive"" word: sin.For a decent movie about Christians try ""Courageous"", ""Flywheel"", or ""Blind Side""."
4,It was really cute,At First When I started watching it I thought that it was going to be stupid but then after I got into it I really enjoyed it.... I am going to add this to my collection with the rest of them..... But Please No More
5,Great!,I love this movie so much! Though I wish it was cheaper to buy or you could rent it for longer.
5,LOVED IT!!!!,"i absolutely love this movie and so does my daughter...she cant get enough of it she watches it almost every single day,as well does my niece"
4,Good movie,"Another installment of the Bring It On Series. I love cheerleading and was excited to see this. I think over time, the plot is a little repetitive. But there is only so much you can do. Up to date dances and actors make each movie new and interesting."
3,Cute for the young crowd,"The ONLY reason that I rented this video was because Jimmy James' song Fashionista was supposed to be on the soundtrack. Thankfully, the song is mixed in at the very end at the pivotal competition. The thing that really bothered me though is that his song, along with a LOT of songs from the film, never made it to the soon to be released CD soundtrack. This is a crying shame since the film did have some really good tracks in it. Overall it's a cute movie but not something I would sit through for a second time. For those also interested in the song Fashionista, it is available on his album ""Jamestown"" as well as a maxi single with some major stomping beats."
3,nothing to get excited about,"I have two girls 4 & 12yrs old, they have watch all the bring it on movies, and this would be the only one that didn't get them excited. the movie was ok, but nothing to get them up and dancing about. they would rather watch the old bring it on movies over & over again."
4,Good Turtle Basking Solution,"This turtle ramp is pretty good.I use a 90Liter tupperware container for my slider and it has rounded sides, so many of the other suction ramps wouldn't have worked.The Good:+ Great suction! This thing really sticks to the side of smooth surfaces.+ Easy to climb. Good traction (ideal for climbing turtles)+ Not too expensive.+ Simple and easy to clean.+ It worksThe Bad:- Not too rigid. Probably ideal for smaller turtles.I bought the large dock, (+/- 9"") and my slider is a good 7"". When she's basking on this thing, it used to sag a little. But I was able to fix this by proping under the side of it. If you have a smaller turtle and need a simple basking area- this product is perfect for you."
3,great ramp arrived broken though,Love the ramp my red eared slider likes to sleep underwater with just his nose out so this was a perfect bed for him and he loves it and sleeps on it but it was not packaged well and arrived broken was able to return but I wound up buying from a pet store instead
4,Really holds up well,"My turtle refuses to climb onto this. Never expected that, so I put a cork slat on top of it because he's used to that. So now he uses it, and it stays in place because the suctions hold well. It serves my turtle's purpose and I don't have to build something up for him to climb on that I then have to clean around. So I'm giving it 4 stars, but if your turtle will climb on it, it really deserves 5 stars."
3,It was too small for my turtle,"This ramp was sleek looking and looked like it would really help my Red Ear Slider, the problem was, it was way too small. The platform was barely big enough for my girl, and theres no way it would hold her weight. I ended up returning it."
3,"Get ""more"" out of crystal method","Great cd yet dull at parts. After The Crystal Method's ""more"" the cd doesn't get any better. Buy it just for the experience of ""more""."
4,"A ""how-to"" writing book that really helps!","I love this book! Very unpretentious, and solidly grounded in a real writer's own experience. I have borrowed it a number of times from our local library, but finally realised that I need my own copy! Yes, all the techniques of fiction are adequately covered, but what makes this book particularly helpful is that it is written in very human terms. It makes you feel you can really do this, and in calm, reasonable steps--without all the ""storm und drang"" of so many writing manuals!"
5,Bernadette of Lourdes,This is the story from which the motion picture is based. Franz Werfel's writing brings Bernadette's story to life. I owned the book for quite a while before reading it...I assumed that it was written by a Catholic who would paint a glowing and sentimental picture of this poor French girl. But Werfel is Jewish and wrote the book in gratitude to God for his escape from the Nazi's. He carefully researched the events of her life and wrote a lucid and insightful account without sentimentality. Although I saw the movie the book is full of details which make this biography shine.
3,Strong Chemical Smell,"I found the BebePod to have a very strong chemical smell. I couldn't stand the smell and couldn't image having a new baby around it, so I returned it. It reminded me of a foam workout mat I once owned that had this strong chemical smell for all the years I owned it (and hardly ever used because of of it).I purchased the Bumbo seat and found it to have almost no smell. They sell a tray attachment for it now too."
2,POD,This product did not work for us. My son was 5 months old when we bought it. It was hard for him to play with toys that were on the ground because the POD sits up high. It was also hard to put him in the POD...He was too big. This product would work better for a younger baby.
1,PRODUCT HAZARD - PARENTS BEWARE,"I'd give this chair 0 stars if that was an option. The chair seemed great at first in helping my son sit upright and practice his sitting skills. He started using the chair around 4 months old. I was very careful in using this chair. I only put him in it when it was on the floor and I was always nearby to supervise. One day my son was reaching for a toy next to the chair and he fell completely out of the chair flat onto his face. Luckily he wasn't hurt and there was no furniture nearby for him to bump into, but this could've been a very serious and scary hazard. The chair seems like a great idea, but I really want all parents to know that it is not safe. I have written the company to complain and am awaiting a full refund. DON'T USE THIS CHAIR FOR YOUR BABY."
4,Among the best in the series,"A fine example of gothic fiction -very entertaining. The author does a nice job developing the tragic character of Strahd, to the point where we sympathize with the vampire. I have also read ""Vampire of the Mists"" and ""Baroness of Blood"", but so far this one is still my favorite."
3,It's a good read but don't get carried away!,"I really liked P.N. Elrod's style and well developed imagination and intelligence. Strahd is not some stupid archetypal vampire (re: his portrayal in Knight of the Black Rose). Despite the slow start, the novel picked up as emotions raged in Strahd. Elrod's linguistics are very developed: fluid, rich and demanding. I haven't read many Ravenloft novels (four), but this and it's sequel are probably the best you'll find. But I can't agree with the five stars flying all around about this book. There are some very good authors out there and you should give them a shot over a novel that was designed over a campaign world the author had no hand in shaping outside of this novel. Elrod has done her best, writing as good as anyone else I'm sure, but she was doomed at the start (although I'm not sure she could have written anything better), because she wasn't given a freedom that may have brought this novel to a deserved 5-star rating."
5,makeing teens depressed is easiy... how about a happy ending,"i bought the hard back version of this book. The only problem i found was that when it ended, i felt very depressed. I hope that there are alot more books on this ""loser vampire"". i mean, damn...cant he win? Just once? i still think this book deserves 5 stars. I only hope that there are alot more books to come. Maybe in the next book the girl he sold his soul for will come back to him. I feel ""Death"" cheated him, and broke the contract. Either I, Strahd gets his soul back or he gets the girl.. and have a few more vampire hunters try to kill him... all together this book was great in details and character building, but it should end when he finally gains the girl and collects all that tax. Can't vampires be greedy too?(kidding)."
3,Convenient,"I'll be honest, I bought the hardcover version of this book for a buck in a bargain bin. This was before the 3rd Edition of Ravenloft came out and rekindled my interest in the setting. I had low expectations and I must say I was pleased with the outcome. Being as Strahd is inspired by Dracula, it is fitting that it is a long journal narrative. If anything it is more romantic and more gothic than Stoker's Dracula and Elrod does a fine job at making Strahd a sympathetic and complex character; you can really tell she cares for the character. Pretty good for gaming-inspired fiction"
2,'Depressing' sums it up nicely.,"I must admit, despite my bias against vampire books, that I really liked the story, the inside look on a 'monster' from his point of view. I could really sympathize with the well-defined character of Strahd. Why the low rating? Simple: the ending. Losing Tatyana by simply being human in thought and action was the epitome of Tragedy. I liked the fact that it didn't end there, but I didn't like where it did end at all. This has to be, counting the ending, the single most depressing book I have ever read in my life. I feel the ending was a humanistic outlook on something misunderstood, and thus called a monster without feeling, and humanity's way of cursing forever that which it does not understand. In a world where the ending makes or breaks a book, this one shattered it horribly. I almost didn't finish reading it when I saw what was going to happen. It's the only book I've ever thrown away."
1,Elrod needs to get over herself,"This book defies description, it so bad. The dialogue is trite, the characters shallow, and the writing amateur. Sorry, Elrod, maybe you should go back to your day job. I'm ashamed I have bought all of Elrod's book on the advice of another author at Uncommon Con in Dallas/Fort Worth last year. I'm beginning to think she was in cahoots with Elrod to sell books for each other."
2,Slow moving with a very thin plot,"I bought this video mainly because the beautiful Maria Ford stars and hey, I'm a sucker for a pretty face. The plot is familiar enough, a stranger (Burnette) wanders into a small town bar and lands a job as the musician. He quickly moves in on the bar owners abused wife (Ford), who in turn sexually manipulates the well meaning musician into murdering her husband. Eventually, she double crosses our hero and.... I thought the movie was a disappointment. The acting was very sub par with the characters being mostly unbelievable. There are a couple of sex scenes featuring Maria Ford, but if that is what you are interested in, she has better scenes in some of her other films. Another main hook to the film is the music by Burnette (Fleetwood Mac) which consists of blandly put together country fare and a far stretch from his Fleetwood background."
3,Bosch 15733,"The fittment was good, have to figure out the wiring on it which can be aggravating but my truck threw the code the next day that the O2 sensor is bad.. SO either I got a bad sensor or that wasn't my problem in the first place. so I can't bad mouth a product or talk good if I'm not sure how it worked."
1,This 4-wire sensor not work on Audi A4,"Got part quickly. Began installing. Old sensor out of manifold. New sensor screwed in. Prepared wire ends for splice. Cut wire from old sensor. Whoa! 5-wires. New sensor has 4-wires.How to install. Not possible.Completely different outputs...Narrowband = 0-1 volt, Wideband = 0-5 Volts..No worky....:-(2003 Audi A4 1.8T"
1,Bad product,I just install in my car. Ran through the cycles and the engine light came back on. Again bad o2 sensor. Now i have to take out of car and ship back to proably get a another bad one from this store.
5,"If you buy the right part & know what your doing, this will get 5 stars","Ordered two of these bad boys from Auto Parts Pro because they had them uber cheap. Make sure your car can use these. I have an Audi A6 2.7T, these work for pre-cat & post-cat applications on my car. These didn't come with all that fancy wire connecting parts pictured in the photos (which I was actually happy about because all that was going to go in the trash anyways) it came with dead on instructions and four red wire connectors (the crush type) Which actually was my original plan in the first place. The only thing I didn't like was they came with only 6 inches of wire attached, which isn't a big deal. BTW Bosch parts are high quality, many stock applications in high end vehicles use Bosch electronics & filters. They might have too fast response time for some cars which will throw a CEL, if you aren't a mechanic, ask one first before purchasing."
1,"Before you buy, get approvement from your mechanic.","My car is Volvo S80 T6 and according to my mechanic I needed a Oxygen Sensor. After checking the model number, engine type and year I decided to buy the product, not one pce. but two, because according to information I needed two for my car. To make a long story short, did not fit and I sit up with a spare-part I have no use for. Don't buy this product unless double check it with your mechanic."
4,o2 sensor,This was a second order as the 1st. one was my mistake. Unfortunately this one was not the sensor I needed either. Returning was not a problem. The process was pretty quickly.
4,Bayou Allsorts.,This album highlights Tab at his best and includes a great selection of sounds from his previous albums. Some new songs and some old and traditional make it a spicy mix to suit the blues ear. No matter which type of blues genre you are into this can't fail to please.
4,Pure hybrid fun..,"Mix soulful blues guitar.. great singing and cajun swing and what do you get? Tab Benoit.. In my opinion, some of the hippest, coolest stuff around. Just pure fun... If you don't tap your toe or want to get up and dance to some of the uptempo tunes..Wel,, you are probably lacking a pulse.. Try it.."
4,Exciting and fun...who knows what will happen?,"Baby-Sitters At Shadow Lake is a very exciting super special of the BSC. It is when they spend vacation at Mr. Brewer's cabin. They find the vacation impossible to resist. Exciting, fun, laughter, and enjoyment will fill your mind when you read this book."
4,Does the job...,"Item was shipped fast and was as described. I have a 16 pound Shih Tzu, and the small one was almost too small. It does that job, but if I were to order again, I would get the medium - large."
5,The Finest Tull Album,"ian pulls it all together. His hard rock side, his folk side, his jazz side, his funky side (!), his serious poetic side, his humorous side, and especially his classical side. This album is arranged like a classical piece; themes pop up and disappear. I honestly don't understand this album was created. It is one of my favorite albums ever. It's infinitely listenable; I used to listen to it a few times a DAY. I can't really describe it; you must experience it. If you like prog, or even if you don't, this album is a MUST A MUST. Tull never got any better; they stayed amazing, but never got past this peak."
3,Good music,Not as good as aqualung but still a good CD. I like to have good music when I am cruising around the lake. Thanks
3,How to Return,To Turnip - Take the vac back to Bed Bath and Beyond and they will replace it. Their sales receipt is good forever.
1,"Lousy, avoid at all costs","I purchased this to replace an older shark that had performed reaonsably well, but had a torn cord. I was drawn by the increased power. Little did I know that the wheels are so poorly designed that when the vac is off, there is already rolling resistance. Turning the vac on, it took effort to move it along (it didn't glide easily) on bare floors. It was useless on carpet where it sucked powerfully enough that it could not move at all. Back to the store it goes."
1,Awful Vacuum Cleaner,"We got this vacuum cleaner along with the Shark handheld as a wedding present.It's awful!The vacuum has 4 filters in it that clog almost instantly when in use, rendering the cleaner useless. The suction, even when the filters are clean, is not very good, and it has a particularly shrill motor noise (not that any vacuum makes a pleasant sound). Also, the wheels seem to be made like those on a toy car, and they don't turn very well. It's really hard to push or pull the thing.This vacuum makes vacuuming even worse of a chore than it should be. Avoid at all costs!"
2,Don't expect too much....,"I bought this vacuum as a cheap ""in between"" vacuum while I saved up to get a better one. It did a pretty good job cleaning my small apartment for about a month. It has a nice LED which tells you when you need to clean the cup and filter. This is also, unfortunently, when the vacuums suction has dwindled to nill. This happens often. After a few minutes of medium to heavy cleaning, the whole thing needs to be cleaned, otherwise your just pushing the thing back and forth for show. After about a month, this condition became permanent. The light stayed on, and the vacuum was basically useless. I hesitate to give this product one star, because it would probably be good for small jobs and light cleaning. Just don't buy it and expect it to be your primary vacuum."
4,Great 2nd vaccum,"I bought this vac to use in the upstairs, since my Hoover is so heavy to carry, I think it is a great little vac. It picks up everything. This vac. is light enough so that it doesn't need to be self propelled. The only thing I found that I didn't like was the fact that if you tip the vac. down one of the filters gets clogged and the red light comes on and you have to wipe it clean. Other than that it is great and i'm happy that I bought it."
1,worthless!,didn't like this vacuum cleaner. it didn't pick much up. then it was a bit of a hassle to get new filters. it broke fairly quickly (w/i months). just stopped working (wouldn't turn on anymore) despite all troubleshooting efforts.
5,Great for hard surfaces,I bought the vac a few months ago and am now shopping for a new vac for the office. While sifting through I thought I would read the reviews on this one. I was a little shocked. I think it works great! I am not sure why you would have bought a vaccum like this for carpets anyway???? It really isn't made for anything more than sisal or jute or some area rugs. It is great however for the hardwood around my house. The handle adjusts for my height and my husband's (not like that happens often) and even my daughter (who is 3 1/2 and thinks it is fun to vaccum). My Bully (yup the target dog) and little girl love to drag dirt everywere. This vac sucks it all up and when I use the attachments it takes the white doggy hair off my dark brown suade sofa. Anyway I felt like I had to put in a better review for those shoppers looking for a great little stick vac!!!
2,the filter sucks,the hepa filter is too tight to let the air through and the vacuum overheats and needs emptying constantly. the filters are expensive $12-24 dollars each and with shipping.... you could keep buying new vacuums
2,quit working,I purchased this vacuum for my new home. After less than 15 min running the machine shuts off. You have to let it cool down and it will start again. The cord is too short and it is hard to push on higher pile carpet.
1,OK Vacuum,I dont think you should buy vacuums that are sold on informercials. All the money is put to the informercial instead of the quality of the vacuum. I dont really think the hepa filter really works that great on my vacuum. There is lots of exhaust and hot air that burns you. It is too small to be a good vacuum. I think the EUREKA vacuum is an awesome vacuum. It maybe featured on this website.
1,It Sucks - NOT!,"Just received the Shark model #ep602 after being on back-order for two months. Easy to assemble, easy to follow instructions. And then I turned it on. With most upright vacs I associate how loud it is with how powerful it is. This vacuum wasn't very loud. I have hardwood and tile floors with a couple of area rugs, it was OK on the floors but when I got to the rugs it was like trying to push a car in park with four flat tires. Not Good. I have a dog and the vac this was supposed to replace I only have to go over the rugs once, but with this vac I went over a couple of times and it still didn't get all the hair up. I am for sure sending it back as soon as I can access their web site or get ahold of somebody on the phone."
1,not worth the $,"bout 2-3 weeks after buying this vac the bottom peice became stuck and you can no longer remove it. The vac already needs a new filter that I cannot find anywhere,it did wonderful on my couches as far as pet hair (i have 3 cats) but now witheout a new filter it started losing suction. this is not at all worth the price I paid for it."
1,Shuts off; rotating brush broke; no good as a handheld,"I have had owned one of these for about a month and absolutely hate it. First, it overheats and shuts itself off after very little use. Second, to use it as a handheld is really awkward. The over-the-shoulder strap is unworkable. Even without the strap, the nozzle is constantly getting twisted with the cord. Third, the brush nozzle on mine has broken. I have two hairy cats so the brush nozzle is a necessity. It looks snazzy, but it's crap."
1,A vacuum that gave me third-degree burns,"I received this vacuum from my mom who saw the company's infomercial and thought of me and my dog. The Shark does an all right job cleaning up my dog's hairs about the house, but the exhaust from this vacuum also left my knees and shins with third-degree burns. This vacuum is not safe to use, especially if you have infants or children in your home."
2,Not recommended.,"I have had this vacuum for a few years. Although it seems to have good suction when you hold your hand up to it, I have found it to be inconsistent.The dust container is easy to empty, but the HEPA filter seemed to clog quickly and didn't clean easily in spite of following the instructions. The Hepa's are expensive to replace too! Like another reviewer, we operated with two vac's, one for our rugs, and this one as a supplemental vac for hose functions. Still, I wasn't satisfied with it and eventually gave it away.I would not recommend this vacuum!!"
1,Unreliable vacuum,"This vacuum began to short out on me after just two weeks of usage. Now, I can't run it for more than 5 minutes at a time without it over-heating and shutting off on me. It takes AT LEAST a half hour before it will turn back on again. Not very conducive to a productive cleaning session!An interesting note: The vacuum I had prior to this one was another Shark brand, but a different model. THAT vacuum lasted all of perhaps not quite one whole year before it began to lose suction.... and shortly thereafter, it completely died.Do yourself a favor and avoid this vacuum at all costs! Find the money for a really good Hoover Wind Tunnel or an Oreck! These cheap vacuums - or maybe it's just this Shark brand(???) - are not worth the money."
2,Good product but HORRIBLE customer service,"Works great on hard surfaces and carpets. Customer Service is horrible, though. We enrolled in the ""Shark Free Filter For Life"" Program but haven't received a filter in over a year (the program stipulates one every 6 months). When I called the toll-free number, the agent was unfriendly and unknowledgeable. She never apologized once about the missing filters. When I asked what had happened, all she was willing to give me was that I didn't receive the filters because of ""some technical problem."" I would NOT get another Shark vacuum for this reason."
1,The worst vacuum I have ever used,I just use it on hardwood and tile and it still doesn't pick up cat hair - basically it's a very noisy fake vacuum cleaner. The suction on it after 2 months of light use is about the same as a very soft breeze.
1,Sorriest vac I've ever had!,"It sucked fairly well for about a week. Now it won't even suck up the smallest visible piece of tissue paper despite my having cleaned everything on the vacuum several times. I have contacted the company three times and they have never answered my email nor my postal mail. It is worthless as a vacuum since, as I said above, it won't pick up an extremely small piece of tissue paper, cat hairs, or anything else that I can see."
3,Euro Pro EP602 Stick Vacuum,"Pluses: lightweight, great for hard floors, very strong suction, telescoping wand.Minuses: Extremely loud, non-adjustable suction makes it very difficult to go over any type carpet, ridiculously short electric cord. Manual says hepa filter is washable, but my vacuum wouldn't work after I washed mine."
2,Stay away from this!,"When I first got this vacuum I thought I had a little gem. It was very powerful and picked up just about anything it was near. Boy....what a surprise I got when it just stopped working! Okay, after about a half hour, I turned it on and it was working again. I learned that you can't use it for too long because it overheats. So I resigned myself to doing little bits of vacuuming at a time. But then, after I had it less than a year, the telescoping handle just broke. I could no longer get it to snap back into place. I sent an e-mail to Shark, and they sent me a new handle, but, although it did snap into place (somewhat), it just twirled around and around. Neither my husband nor I could get it to stay straight. I just gave up on it at that point. I've never had so much trouble with a vacuum. I advise you to stay away from this, and all Shark products. Judging from everything I've read here on Amazon and elswhere, the quality of their products is very poor."
1,It Fell apart!!,"I bought this vacuum cleaner at Bed Bath and Beyond, In Ohio.I paid 60.00 for it. In the first 3 weeks, the release button for the suction head fell out, I can not remove the floor attachment anymore.After 8 weeks of use, on 2 rooms of hardwood floors the handle broke. I can no longer turn the vacuum around corners, the handle just spins in its socket, around and around.After only 12 weeks of use, the hinge that holds the bottom lid of the dust cup just broke off when I pushed the button to empty the cup.Now, if I take out the dust cup, the lid falls off and dumps the dirt all over the floor again.I have contacted the company 4 times in 6 months and they have not answered my mail or my email. They have not contacted me at all to make good on their product or warranty.Buy this vacuum at your own risk. My experience has been awful so far.Jane Kohler-Ohio"
3,Good vacuum but needs improvements,"Since I purchased the vacuum, we have been impressed with the vacuumcharacteristics, but along with the other comments of quiting when hot, it has quit twice until cooled off. We tried to disconnect the floor attachment but found that it had been so hot it either warped the spring or melted the release button so it could not operate properly and not release. Being made out of plastic has its advantages: light weight, probably cheaper to make but the motor needs more ventalation or the case needs to be made of a light weight metal. We are other wise impressed the way it vacuums dog hair from carpet or hard wood floors. If improvements were made, then I would recomend buy this system. But as it is, for the price its up to some thought and I would recomend not to run unit too long and allow to cool."
5,I enjoyed all the poems I read,"I fell in love with all the poems I read. It truely reminds me of poems mothers would read to their child for bed. The illustrations were very beautiful and dramatic. The pictures were so bright and colorful. Children from ages 0 to 5 would love to look at the pictures and illustrations in this book. Even though a child that young can't read, it would be very amazing to their eyes. At my age, I would love to either read the poems to a group of children or even have the children read them in silent reading. This book would also allow the child to be imaginative and creative. These poems are fun to listen to and not poems that are meant to be preached."
4,Nice Collection,"This is a wonderfully illustrated collection of children's poems. My daughter loves to look at the pictures, but there are not as many poems as other collections, like the one from Random House. It would make a great gift."
1,atrocious illustrations!,"I bought this book for my 9-year old who loves poetry. I'm basing my review merely on the illustrations. I was convinced by the many positive reviews, speaking so favorly regarding the illustrations that this book would be enjoyable to read and to look at. Upon receiving the book I couldn't believe how unappealing the so-called artwork is. I would be surprised to find any children captivated by poor modern, streaky-looking water color paintings within this book. To me they are darnright ugly. I personally have a preference for the illustrations of those like Michael Hague and Jan Brett who have illustrated numerous beautiful children's books."
2,Was Expecting Something Much Better,"Frankly, these floor mats are absolutely underwhelming.Was expecting a heavy-duty, rubberized mat capable of standing up to cold weather and rough use in my 2012 Econoline. Instead, the mats are plastic and very thin. Not sure they will make it through the upcoming autumn rains and winter snow.On the plus side, well-molded and fit perfectly.But oh so underwhelming. Not saying they are not worth buying. But I am saying they don't seem to me to be worth the price. Will be looking elsewhere for something better."
1,would be more interesting..,if the author had any writing talent. i found it to be a waste of my time as the authors main points are common sense. the majority of the book is mind numbing filler in my opinion and completely unoriginal with the exception of authors ability to expose his mental deficiencies.check out Frank Wu's 'Yellow' if you want an insightful look into what race means in America.
2,Pad Brush,"I am not wild about this item. Maybe my technique is at fault, but... I think this is too rough on foam pads and in my experience it can damage your pad and shorten it's life if you are not careful with it. I prefer turning my polisher on and pushing a towel against the pad every so often to clean it over this brush method."
5,Veggie ROCKS!,"I came from a pretty hardrock background as far as music goes, so it was refreshing to find stuff with clean fun lyrics that also sounds good. These Veggie tunes rock me to the core!"
1,not what i expected,"When I bought this item it was advertised as ""Veggie Tales: Veggie Rocks"". This is false advertisment to me, these are not the Veggie Tales characters! I did not know it was different artists singing the veggie tales songs. How crazy is that? I cant figure out why an artist would want to try and make these silly songs serious? Its just wierd. Maybe they are trying to be funny?And now i have this completely useless cd..."
4,Veggies Rock!,"Our family loves these grown-up versions of many familiar Veggie Tales tunes! Originally, I bought this cd for my husband. We quickly discovered that our 2 yr old daughter and her 2 yr old cousin love these hard rock hits too. Almost every time we get into the car, my daughter asks to hear this cd.Our favorite songs include ""The Water Buffalo Song"", ""Belly of the Whale"" and ""I Love My Lips"". My husband really likes the edgy, hard-hitting song ""Stand"". Overall, the songs offer a good range of different rock styles with the entertaining lyrics of Veggie Tales we have come to love."
5,Our entire house are Veggie Fans!?!,"Got kids from 5 to 17? Parents in the house with a crazy sense of humor? Then you'll love this VEGGIE ROCKS album! The four people in our house have different favorite songs (the PIRATE SONG has always been a strong contender!), and this CD is one we always take along in the car on any lengthy drive.Fun!"
5,BILL ELLIOTT; THE PEACEABLE MAN,VERY WELL WRITTEN WITH MANY LITTLE KNOWN FACTS. I WAS LOOKING FOR A HISTORY OF BILL ELLIOTT'S WORK PLUS INFORMATION ON HIS PERSON LIFE. BILL ELLIOTT WAS VERY WELL LIKE BY HIS PEERS AND OTHER PEOPLE HE WORKED WITH. ALL THIS IS THE KIND OF INFORMATION YOU LOOK FOR IN THIS TYPE OF BOOK.
2,TO MANY LISTS,The info about his sidekicks was more informative than Bill's biofgraphy. The picures were the best part of this book.
5,Bill Elliott: The Peaceable Man,"My husband was crazy over the old cowboys and Western stars: Roy Barcroft, Bill Elliott, James Arness, John Wayne, etc. I used to buy him the books that were published that dealt with any of the old-timers, and he loved them all. The book is very informative about this classy man - if you like bios about any of these men, then I would suggest this is one to add to your library. The only drawback is that it does not come in hard-back; but it is a great book anyway."
3,I was there!,"Dude, you still don't know who Jim Belushi is. James Gandolfini is in ""The Sopranos."" Jim Belushi is the brother of the late John Belushi (""Animal House"" and ""Blues Brothers""). He co-stars in the ABC-TV show called ""The World According To Jim.""Anyway, most of the reviews are correct. This IS a fun film to watch and be part of. The bulk of it was filmed in Australia. I was in Maroubra (which is a suburb of Sydney) when they were filming the scenes of the race's start. I got a chance to talk with J. Moki Cho (who plays Gilbert Tutu) and Jim Belushi actually said ""how's it going?"" to me while he was in the makeup chair. I have a photo of Halle Berry standing underneath an sun umbrella and nearly bumped into Kevin Tighe (remember the TV show ""Emergency""?) as we came around a corner of the convenience."
2,Not terrible,"This movie was ""okay"" but if I hadn't been from Hawaii, I doubt if it would have held my interest. If you are from Hawaii, don't expect all the characters to be authentic - seems like they had mainland actors trying to act like locals. The acting and the script were sub-par. Fortunately, I watched on TV so I could turn away whenever the racing part was not on. Who wants to watch typical adolescent conversations if they can avoid it? This is one of those stupid PG movies that will not hold an adult's interest but they throw in some bad words and a middle finger so you wouldn't want your kids to watch it."
5,The best,"When I was just becoming a mathematician, my teacher gave me this book, saying ""You're not ready for this yet, but you should have it --- it's the best piece of mathematical exposition there is."" Maybe that claim's exaggerated, but I've yet to find one I prefer. Along with Milnor's Lectures on the h-Cobordism Theorem, and his Characteristic Classes, this book is a lesson not only in topology (and wonderful topology, too!), but in clear writing as well."
4,Very interesting...,"Obviously, one has to be familiar with upstate New York to fully appreciate this work. For those who are, it is very interesting. Haydon gives a seemingly well researched account of the upstate region between the war of 1812 up to the 1840's. The book is composed of selections from journals and books that British visitors wrote while visiting, as well as commentary from the author. It covers most of upstate with the exception of the Adirondacks, which the author claims was not fully explored (by British tourists) until later in the century. The author also claims to have preferentially included selections from lesser-known authors over those famous folks that can mostly be found elsewhere. I recommend this book, especially for people who are from the region and interested in reading some historical accounts from the early 19th century."
1,skin for phone is a poor design,"This product is a disaster and I highly recommend you do not purchase. It does not ""hug"" your phone as other designs do. The back of skin is cut low allowing sides to hang off and catch on everything. It is ""baggy"" on phone. I threw it away as it did not even come close to fitting my phone which it was stated to fit. I have never been so disappointed with a product. What a joke!!!LG VX-8600 AX-8600 Premium Translucent Pink Silicone Skin Protective Case Cover DO NOT BUY"
4,"Top notch Trance, by the master himself!","DJ Taylor is one of the best Trance DJs in America, IMHO. This mix is rather old (1995), but it is still some great music. And although this is a great release, I can't give it 5 stars, because I heard Taylor's mix on United DJs of America #10...that release has completely spoiled me and made all other Trance releases a joke. But this is a great CD for anyone into this style of music."
2,"Maybe authentic to the region, but not fresh","I was disappointed in this book, because I'm not a fan of using things that come out of cans. I will, however, roast my own chiles and try the recipes that way. I was surprised by all the accolades when we are trying to go fresh, fresh, fresh!"
2,Not a good companion to Red Chile Bible,"I guess this book went out of print just before I bought it... Damn. I could have saved myself some money there. This cookbook is poor. Most of the recipes call for cans of stuff or mixes of spices that are sold pre-packaged in stores. When I buy a cookbook it's because I want to cook, not open cans and throw stuff in a pot or casserole dish. For a cookbook that breaks down the flavors and styles...move on."
5,Silver Rosary Bracelet,"The bracelet was exactly as described. I gave it as a gift to my friend and she loved it. She wears it all the time. It is a perfect length and very shiny. Totally worth the price, which is a good deal."
4,Excellent quality,the cordless impact driver kit is of high quality and good value for the money. The free drill was a nice added attraction.
5,Makita 12-Volt Cordless NiMH Impact Driver Kit with Drill,"If you use a cordless drill to drive screws, you'll love this impact driver. I don't know why I did not get one sooner. It made building things a lot easier. Great deal for the price."
2,"Compelling Moments, but Disappointing Overall","I can see how some readers might be put off by all of the science and detail in this book, though I was personally not bothered by it. There were several things that did trouble me however:1.) The abrupt switch in the third section from first person to third person. I felt separated from the characters, especially Claire, and more or less ceased to care about her. Her behavior on the expedition didn't feel like the person that was established in the first two-thirds of the book, either.2.) The many parallels between Magda and Claire felt a little contrived. Her quest to trace her family's history was compelling in and of itself, and didn't need to have those ""clairvoyant"" elements.3.) The Ripper subplot was pointless and uninteresting. For a truly fascinating real theory about the Ripper murders, read Alan Moore's From Hell.4.) Absolutely no resolution on what happened to Nick and Christian.5.) The Jack-Claire affair was just creepy."
1,"Not cohesive, persuasive or interesting","The romantic adventure that's promised by reading the summary of this book is not delivered within its pages. Instead, I've found a book that is too contrived and uncohesive. New ideas and characters are introduced clumsily. The author struggles to tie together a tangle of these different thoughts and characters and the reader is lost in the middle. Waiting for the story to weave together takes way too long and I began to question the investment of time I was putting into the book waiting for it to intrigue me as it had promised."
2,unreadable,"I found this book to be ponderous and, in the end, unreadable. I gave up on it with only 100 pages left to read - I cared that little about what was going to happen to the characters. The book is now in the donation bin of my local public library."
4,Love the Ideas!!,The ideas in this book are great! They are some we have all thought of but have never really used because we weren't sure exactly how! This shows you how step by step!
4,Shocking,"On p. 46 of this fine book published by the venerable Vintage Press, one reads about Amsterdam and 'it's economic life' (sic). It's cringeworthy enough on a blog. Heads should be rolling at Vintage, I say."
4,"Easy to read, nice for travel","I read this book before and during a recent trip to Amsterdam. It was really nice to have some of the history and specific anecdotes from the book in my mind as we traveled around the city. It would be great if the book were updated if only to cover the period since the mid 90s forward, iirc the book was published in 95 and doesn't cover much of the current culture or history of the city. It's full of history and reasons for how and why Amsterdam came to be what it is, written in a easy to consume, journalistic style."
3,THE BEST INSTRUMENTAL NUMBERS ARE MISSING FROM THIS ALBUM,"Going over the tune titles, right off the bat I was surprised that a couple of my instrumental favorites were missing .The beautifully soulful, atmospheric TALES of KILIMANJARO should definitely be on there as well as what I consider to be the most ambitious number from the fusion period, the epic FLAME/SKY. Fans who would purchase an all instrumental Santana album are astute listeners looking for the more obscure gems--who needs another best of album with all the obvious tunes? I give this cd three stars not for what it contains but for what it's missing."
4,From the inside!!,"This is a very good compilation of only instrumentals by the master. My only regret is that ""Every Step of the Way"" from ""Caravanserai"" is missing. That is one of the most powerful Santana songs ever. Also, my favorite in this compilation is ""Aquamarina""."
5,"Santana, Best Instrumentals","If you are a big Santana fan, this is one that you must add to your collection."
3,Santana The Best Instrumentals,"This CD has a number of Santana's classic hits like Samba Pa Ti, Flor de Luna, and Soul Sacrifice that I really enjoyed, however, in my opinion those are the only really good songs and this is a mediocre album."
5,Santana,Great CD--If YOUR LOOKING FOR A GREAT INSTERMENTAL SANTANA CD THIS IT! !! I would highly recommend this CD to anyone
4,What a progression!!,"Skillets previous albums ""Alien Youth"" and ""Collide"" was very catchy and wellperformed records with lots of emotion ,heaviness and melody but with this they have really set a huge landmark in the world of alternative rock. ""Comatose"" is packed to the limit with huuuge choruses and emotional lyrics mixed with huge string arrangements and crunchy postgrunge guitars! The biggest surprise of the year?! Skillet is definetely nominated!! =)Wonder if their next record could be better.....hardly bigger anyway!! ;)Thumbs up guys!! (and girls)Highlights: Rebirting, The Last Night, Say Goodbye"
2,Music is pretty good..... the singer ruins it!,"I loved seeing RED in concert in cleveland and looked up their cd on amazon. I saw Skillet and that they were rated 4.5 stars. I listened to skillet's music from both cd's and was turned off when the singer opened his mouth. The music was good, but the singer should not be in this type of band."
4,Good,"This is suprisingly good. Most bands today have the problem of sounding the same. However, this album is actually really good. It's not really original, but I like it anyway. The girls voice in this makes it really interesting."
5,"Skillet ""Comatose"" Review",Great music! I've Loved their music for along time! Skillet is a amazing Christian metal band. Not all of their songs concern God but they are still a very clean band. I highly suggest this CD to anyone looking for some awesome Christian Rock music!
3,Good Punk-Rock but not really Christian Songs/music,"I got this CD because of the sound and because i thought it was primarly Christian since i heard them on AOL Christian Radio. But after listening to it, i figured it is not...the name of the Lord is not mentioned once or even a hint of him. Its basically a secular group with maybe christian members. ;-)"
3,No complaints,Product came in excellent condition. No recommendation or complaint about the artist - they were average.
5,BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This album was on sale at my local christian book store and was available to listen to samples via the barcode. I've never heard of Skillet before and I listen to a couple of contemporary Christian FM channels too. Guess I lived under a rock but now I see the light! My son has played cello since the 4th grade so the orchestral accompaniment on some of the tracks ROCKED! This music appeals to both young and not-as-young alike!
5,Best Skillet Ever,I am amazed that Skillet can keep producing great albums and seem to be at their best with this release. Keep it up!
3,Wear did the alien youth go?,"I have been a pan head for a long time, and while I think they still put on a really excellent show I think this album was not on par with the others. It seems with each new album they change their style and grow as a band, but this album I did not see growth in their music writing, many of the songs sound similar to one another and they aren't as lyrically amazing as past albums. If you like Evanescence you will like this, but if you like electronica and industrial music stick with Invincible or Alien Youth. If you like really good hard rock buy Collide. All Skillet fans should still get this to support a great band, but don't expect it to blow you away."
5,Skillet's best yet...?,"Comatose, the latest album from Skillet, is described by the band as a different sound than previous works from this foursome--and Comatose doesn't disappoint.Having purchased several Skillet works before (back to ""Hey You, I Like Your Soul"") this is perhaps my favorite Skillet album yet. Track to track brings you in with much more harmony and musical diversity than was present in ""Alien Youth"" or ""Collide.""While every track on comatose is catchy and has great tonal qualities, it's not an album that will immediately get you in the mood for a ""mosh pit"" like Collide.Skillet's latest, though, is a gem."
4,Really like it,"I would give it 5, but I only really wanted songs that rocked pretty hard. There are couple of softer tracts that I generally skip. Overall a great album!"
3,Just can't beat Collide this time..,"It's not that this is a bad album, just kind of lackluster compared to what it could have been. Better Than Drugs is a great song but the rest of the cd isn't all that."
4,Skillet Comatose,"I have been a Skillet fan for a long time. While the music on this album is good, I guess I was expecting tunes in the vain of the songs on Collide such as Savior and Open Wounds. On this release they have toned down the sound a notch or two."
4,Skillet does it again,"Skillet has always been one of my favorite bands, each album they've released had a bit of a different twist on it. The lyrics on comatose was defenitely some of the best lyrics they have ever written. They've taken a more soft approach towards the music though and I miss the awesome guitar sounds they introduced in Collide, but still the album remains a must for christian rock lovers."
5,Best Christian Rock Available!,"If I had to recommend a Skillet cd to someone to get them hooked it would be this one! The range of music is superb, a MUST HAVE just buy it. You won't regret it, 10 stars"
5,This cd is amazing,"Skillet is my favorite band of all time. They have a good modern, alternative rock feel to them while at the same time have inspiring lyrics that leave you breathless. I also like that they are a christian rock band without being overly preachy about God. This is my favorite cd from them, my favorite songs are Rebirth, Comatose, Whispers in the Dark, Last night, Yours to Hold, Those Nights, and Better Than Drugs.I can't wait for their new album to come out!!!"
3,Why do almost all the songs sound the same?,"I wanted to like this CD. But let's face it, after the first 2 songs it all just starts to sound cloned. Is this what a good album is supposed to sound like? I remember when every Skillet track had a unique sound, but alas, those days are gone.If you like music that all sounds the same as the last track, this is a great CD for you. Otherwise purchase the first, second, and last track by themselves. They are really the only tracks that matter."
2,still waiting for some reason,it is now the 17th of august and we have not yet received this cd for some reason. this is highly unusual from our past amazon orders......martha reimer
5,Exhilarating Vibrations,"This is absolutely one of my favorite albums. Skillet has been evolving their music style and lyrics over the past few years, and Comatose is a reflection of that! It combines the sweet melodies of an orchestra with the exhilarating vibrations of hard rock. This album is only compared by seeing them perform live! They have evolved from an amiable mild sound to a heart pumping epic. I can't wait to hear the next step in their Evolution!"
3,"Good, but...","Not nearly as good as I had anticipated. I have been a Skillet fan for years, I own all of their albums, I have been to several live shows, and I love the guys and girls in this band for their integrity and honest lyrics. That is one of the two major problemss I have with this album. Lyrically, there is some good stuff here, BUT at certain points, the lyrics get really vague. It leaves me wondering who we are talking about, a girlfriend or God. Secondly, I have some problems with a couple of the songs just being far too...like Nickelback. For me, this similarity of sounds is not cool. I cannot stand Nickelback, but ""Older"" and ""Goodbye"" sound eerily similar (Nickelback's producer did handle these songs, so I guess that is why). Nevetheless, I did enjoy Rebirthing, Comatose, Better than Drugs, and Whispers, as well as a couple of others. However, my gripes with the lyrical and musical content were enough to lower my ranking. I will be hoping for a better effort next time."
5,Out of the Skillet and into the Frying Pan!,"This CD is fantastic. I heard Rebirthing on the Gospel Channel and owned the CD within a week. Naturally, I listened to Rebirthing until I couldn't take it anymore (which was quite a while). Once I did, I realized, every track on this CD is worthy of the same airtime as Rebirthing. I don't say that lightly. I'm very stingy with my cash on CD's having grown up when they cost over $20 and all you got were 3 great songs. Now I usually buy the download song for .88 cents rather than splurge on the entire CD. Rebirthing made me buy the entire CD and I'm glad I did. This music rocks."
5,Clearly their best.,"Most bands seem to peak with their first, second, maybe third album. Well, it took Skillet a decade (and I don't know how many albums later) to produce a truly great album. Here, finally, is the mature, creative, talented Skillet that's been waiting to bloom, separating them from the mass of mediocre Christian grunge-metal bands out there. Yes, this album is a little more polished and has greater pop-sensibility than their previous work, but it's entirely for the good. From beginning to end, this album does not disappoint. They truly should get mainstream play with this album. It's hard to pick favorite tracks, but I would point you to ""The Older I Get"" and ""Those Nights,"" plus, of course, the fantastic first single, ""Rebirthing."""
5,Excellent! Shows the band's wide array of talent,"This Skillet cd is one of their best, as is Collide; either are very good. This cd has several selections that are excellent, from the hard pounding ""Rebirthing"" tract and ""The Last Night"", and ""Whispers in the Dark"" but it also contains a couple of more mellow songs. The ""Looking for Angels"" is a hard-hitting truth song of how life is so difficult for some of those among us; to me this is, along with ""Rebirthing"", exceptional. I bought this again as the first one somehow got lost and I had to have another one!"
5,Awesome CD,I really enjoy listening to this CD. It if full of great songs. Even my kids like it. Great for home or the car!
1,music CD,I would give no stars if that is possible. I did not receive the CD. I emailed the vendor 2 times and didn't receive a response.
5,There's no stopping Skillet.,"To get straight to the point, Comatose is probably Skillet's best album ever. Without hearing anything on this record before buying it, I was completely convinced that there was no way Comatose could come close to comparing to ""Collide"" ~ which I thought was even better than the outstanding record ""Alien Youth."" Comatose is packed from start to finish with songs you probably won't ever skip. The tracks just rock my face off. I would rate this album 6 stars if I could. Its that good."
5,A gentle passage to the other side of eternal life,Author relates how she comforted terminally ill people with compassion and love. Prayers for each situation are excellent.
4,Very nice book,The book was a good read and helpful. I would appreciate it being a little more Jesus Christ focused though
5,Encouraging,This book was so helpful and encouraging to me as I cared for my husband. The stories are so real and the prayers I used daily. Wow! I recommend this for all who are caring for a loved one who is dying.
4,Must read for our Pastoral Calling team.,"Outstanding. I was blessed to have been trained by Joyce Hutchinson as a Hospice volunteer. Her stories bring to life her straight forward approach to her ministry. Open, loving, touching, affirming and grace giving.Joyce Rupp's reflection questions, prayers and thoughts for the day give the framework for training our Pastoral Care team. A must resouce for all congregations who belive in shared leadership and pastoral care."
5,More than Comfort,The prayers and Meditations were so helpful that I purchased extra for those I knew were experiencing this journey. The price enabled me to afford this gift.
2,It sure isn't the Prince of Thieves!,"I was really excited to get this book, until i got this book. It doesn't even seem like it was written by the same author. Save your money."
4,No issues with 2001 Ford F150 4.6L V8,"Been running them for about 5-6 months now. A mechanic told me that these plugs normally burn too hot, but he didn't see any issues when he pulled a single plug out of my engine. Price is about average for other platinum plugs. No real price advantage and because they're 'known' to run too hot is why I dropped one star... But I really have no issues with them -- could be a 5-star product. Run similar Bosh plugs on my bike.. no issues there, either."
2,unimpressed,They work but not near as well as a cheap ngk. old spark plugs would start with one try when the truck is cold. new spark plugs take two tries when the truck is cold.
2,Does not work with my application,I purchased these plugs as they were at a great price and the description says that it works for my car (2001 Mustang GT). When I went to get them installed the mechanic told me that the plugs will not work for my car as they will burn too cold and not pass smog here in California. I checked with another mechanic and he concurred. I wish I would have known about this issue before I purchased them. Be wary if you have the same situation as these plugs may be of no use to you.
3,Spell Check Please!,"The books was very interesting, but I wish the author would learn how to spell. I found this & her other novel ""Voodoo Love"" very difficult to read from all the grammatical errors. This author must have rushed on this novel because every other sentence was missing a period, words were being hyphenated, and don't let me get started on how comma happy she was. Better luck next time!"
1,THIS BOOK SHOULD BE BURNED,"This book was the worst peice of GARBAGE I have ever read. Just because the author received a word processor for XMAS does not make her a writer. She should have left this mess in her creative writing class. She should have consulted a few people before unleashing this garbage on an unsuspecting public. Everybody wants to be an artist but some of us need to be more realistic in our career pursuits. This author should stick to doing hair in her kitchen and leave the writing to the professionals. 1 star is being to generous, hell 0 is being to generous for this. Save this book until winter so that you may have something to toss on the fire."
4,The Search is On !,"Jazzmen was on a search to find a man after she promised herself she wouldn't! But after the betrayal of Quan with her so called best friend ! She thought having a man would make a difference in her life . She was hard on herself.Allowing herself to get in the same situations . She promised she would never repeat after Quan ! I guess some things are unpreventable for women , like falling in love ?I thought Derrick would be the one especially when he promised he would not hurt her ! Maybe Derrick was afraid to love again or just maybe he was not ready for the C ( commitment ) word !I couldn't help but think if Derrick had been upfront with his feelings and told Jazzmen he wasn't ready ..... maybe she wouldn't have given him her heart !So now ,The Man Hunt continues , should she give up , and wait on love ? It could come when you least expect it !"
3,A Muddled Brickman,"I have to admit I am a Brickman fan.I like simple piano music with the occasional sax or chello.What I don't like are muddled vocals and bad production. Brickman should have stayed with the clean crip production of Windam Hill. Sara Evans..yeah ..like she can really sing.Her vocals should be left at the bottom of the well where it sounds like this song was recorded. Brickman piano..Great but dull on this CD.It sounds like he had to come up with something and knocked out the first take on every song. Very dissapointing. Stick with ""My Romance "" and save your money on this one."
2,Missing Songs,I love Jim Brickman's music. But this album does not play all of the music. Several of the songs will not play. Very disappointing.
2,More Mediocrity from Brickman,"I've been aware of Jim Brickman's work for quite a while, as I worked with him a number of years ago. At the time, my co-workers and I were not big fans of Jim's music but we supported it because we had to. One guy I worked with described his work as ""soulless"" while a female colleague said ""Listening to Jim's music is like listening to the color white.""Sadly, my co-workers' comments still hold up. With his latest album, ""Escape,"" it's apparent that Brickman's style hasn't changed that much over the years. It's still pleasant, New Agey background music -- so inoffensive that it becomes offensive! If this genre is your cup of tea, that's fine -- but do yourself a favor and buy something by Yanni or even John Tesh."
1,Very Boring.,"I am an avid reader of all types of fiction. This book is one of the worst that I have ever read. The story is basically about a woman who is dealing with the recent death of someone she loved. However, it is written without any emotion. I never felt the sadness, beauty, or passion, that should of been translated through a story such as this one. I felt like I was watching grass grow. It was difficult to finish."
5,Works on my 4runner,"I bought this to do the ""Deckplate mod"" to my Toyota 4Runner's air box and it worked perfectly. Seals tight and lasts long, cant ask for much more of a deck plate"
3,Camino al Infierno,"I order this movie because I couldn't find it in any other place. However when I received this product, the product was incomplete. In other words content was missing. It was not a complete movie. Why? I do not know. But I am just not happy that what I order is not complete. Thank you very much."
3,Pleasant little story,This book trips along nicely in some parts. Loses it a little toward the end. A quiet Sunday afternoon book.
5,A Detailed Study of The Sociopath,"Forget words like 'hard-boiled' and 'noir'. This is one of the finest studies of the sociopathic mind ever written. By using the interior monologue that Thompson is uniquely gifted to use, the reader is carried along on a wave of abject violence unlike any other in literature. It is truly a carnival ride through the fun house, except it isn't fun. The darkness is truly a revelation of character. Maybe the Killer is inside all of us. With Thompson's brilliant writing, it feels possible. This is the type of horror that Stephen King would be proud of."
5,Inside who,"Thompson uses the fun loving Lou Ford to explore the most evil root in every man's core. ""It is better to burn than to rot"" and Lou Ford makes his own decisions unlike his victims, who, tend to not be filled with all that much substance. A hooker, a spoiled young rich slob, a bum and a common nobody all fall victim to the judgement of Lou Ford. It's much like Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" except the reader actually gets to journey into the mind of the killer, unlike ""Darkness"" where the reader has to read Marlow's accounts of Kurtz, second hand. ""The Horror, The Horror."""
1,Not worth the time,"What a disappointment. This book is being filmed in my community and I was anxious to read it. Boring! Predictable until the last chapter and then just a let down. If you enjoy reading about a perverted, sick man who kills people just to kill them - well have at it! The author does not make much of a subplot and the story line is muddled throughout. I don't even think I will waste my time at the movie - even if it was filmed in one of my favorite restaurants. Nothing redeemable here."
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"This book is simply terrible. The plot unravels, makes no sense after 70 pages, still 150 pages of padding to go...the ending is ridiculous.I guess he wrote this as some kind of protest against Capitalism or God knows what.Zero stars is more like it. Awful!!!"
1,Pointless,This book was too shallow and without a meaningful plot. I would not recommend it. So much more could have been developed.
3,This is supposed to be good writing?,"I really wanted to like Jim Thompsons stuff. I like noir, and am interested in Thompsons life (from the culturally dead Midwest, his collaborations with Stanley Kubrick, his communist sympathies, his alcoholic breakdown). I found a copy of Recoil after I saw several impressive reviews of his stuff. Recoil was an easy read, but average. Nothing great stylistically or in substance. I then read more about the author, and found that Killer Inside Me was his best, most ground breaking work. But this book was bland. While trying to swrite from the first person view of a criminally sick mind, we get none of the depth into sickness and depravity that writers like Dosteovsky, Poe, or more recently Larry Browne can give. The dialogue is totally unbelievable and often absurd, especially the inner dialogue of the killer. The ending seems amazingly hurried and botched. This book may feed some men's macho fantasies, but as work of art its fairly mediocre."
3,"Gripping, but slightly incoherent","The story and the atmosphere keep this piece above water, but the style is flat and feeble. After all, the ending is rewarding in its unexpectedness."
5,"Extremely entertaining, yet disturbing read","The first person narrative of this novel challenges the reader ethically, forcing them to see and rationalize each murder as it takes place through the mind of Lou Ford. It forces the reader to question whether or not there is a killer inside each and every one of us. Truly disturbing, yet well written. Read this book! Cheers!"
3,Movie was better,I bought this book because the movie seemed to be missing details. the movie left me wanting more details to explain some of the plot. Sadly the book didnt offer anything extra.
4,Old But Great,"An 'amazon.com' reader who had seen my review of my favourite book 'American Psycho' (by Bret Easton Ellis) recommended me Jim Thompson's 'The Killer Inside Me'.Well, I would not compare Thompson's novel to Ellis' writing style, in no way. Still, 'The Killer Inside Me', in all its simplicity, is a thrilling an exciting crime story that it is very hard to put aside, once you have started reading it!It tells the straight-forward story of a deputy-sheriff who kills the people who get in the way of his private life. Nevertheless, and since you see the happenings from inside the deputy's head, he is not exactly unsympathetic. In fact, he is so caring and intelligent, that it grows to serious mental illness.And even though 'The Killer Inside Me' takes place in the 1950s, it might as well be contemporary. Nothing in the story makes it outdated.A brilliant bedtime crime story! Easily and quickly read!"
1,Boring book,It is very very boring book. I wouldn't recommend this book. Its a waste of money. I am not sure.
2,Very Creepy,"I had to read this book for a class. I know what you're thinking, ""For class? What class was this, Murder 101?"" Well, not quite. We read dark novels from the first person perspective. And that is exactly what this book is. The reader gets into the head of a killer and watches, almost feels the protaganist slowly go insane. While there are grittier books out there, this was still very creepy to read. It does have a good amout of plot movement though, very few boring, slow passages, but you alomost wish there were more so there is less blood and crazy."
3,Everyone Needs to Relax,"The book was all right. Everyone here seems to be exaggerating. I found the plot pretty stupid, but that is what was part of the thrill. This boring, average next door neighbor decides to start killing people off for no apparent reason. But he does have HIS reasons- I work in the Mental Health field so I could see this guy in some of my patients. Seeming ""NORMAL"" but having that disorder that no one can really understand or see. The book had its ups and down. Nothing major. The book seems almost rushed. I couldn't relate any to of the characters. Even Lou, the main character. But the book was published in 1952. So maybe for it's time it was a great book. Like I said it was good, but 3 stars- no more no less."
4,A Texas noir,"What's chilling about this guy is he's a sociopath and he knows he's a sociopath. Still, he can logically explain the reasons for each of his murders...until he can't anymore. The use of the first person is insidious, as the reader spends 244 pages inside Lou Ford's head. A few minor plot inconsistencies, but an amazing, sad, almost cinematic ending."
3,The killer Inside Me,"An easy read not my usual genreCertainly a change of pace for me. Still prefer something not so gory,"
3,Good book,"This is a quick-paced, relatively short novel that purportedly amounts to ""probably the most chilling and believable first-person story of a criminally warped mind I have ever encountered"" (quote by Stanley Kubrick on front cover). While I think this is a great overstatement, I did find the book very engaging and entertaining. I don't think it conveyed a terribly nuanced or deep evocation of sociopathic thinking, and I found parts of the book to be a bit confusing and obscure in their use of indirect language. But it is a solid, classic choice that maintains its suspense and that successfully evokes a different time, place, and culture."
2,Typical Edgy But Flawed Plot,"The typically edgy, sparse writing of Jim Thompson almost kept me reading this drama about a mean, killer sheriff, much like a Cormac McCarthy character. However, the plot line eventually turned me off because it really made no sense. The protaganist beats a whore to death and kills her boyfriend and somehow they convince the DA and Sheriff, as well as the boyfriend's rich Daddy, Conway, that the whore killed the boyfriend. Huh? My suspension of disbelief just left the building. I have enjoyed most other Thompson books, and I realize this is considered a cult classic, but it left me cold as the main character's heart."
4,"Simple, devious, and dark","Long before teenage slasher flicks gave us the killer's-eye-view, Jim Thompson wrote ""The Killer Inside Me,"" the first-person story of Lou Ford, the seemingly humble deputy of a small town in Texas. But Lou's got a couple deep, dark secrets and a past that'll curl your hair. There's no looking off-camera in ""The Killer Inside Me,"" but rather a creepy intimacy that has you wondering whether to sympathize with the guy or not. Sure he's nuts, but he makes it all sound so *reasonable*, so matter-of-fact. Along the way, Thompson cranks up the dramatic irony as more of the locals begin to suspect and close in on Lou, building the story to a pitch that can only lead to a truly horrific act, like all good serial killer narratives inevidably do. The title of this deceptively simple work of 1950's maniac pulp is perhaps misleading-- After 240 pages there's no denying that it's us who are inside the killer."
3,"Too long, too many mediocre songs","There are some fine songs on this double live CD, but almost all of them (with the exception of the grand ""Perfect Strangers"") are from Deep Purple's seventies repertoire.The newer stuff mainly serves one purpose: to remind the listener how inferior Deep Purple's eighties and nineties releases were compared to ""Machine Head"" and ""Fireball"".Ian Gillan and the band perform superbly on ""When A Blind Man Cries"", the album's best cut, and there are a handful of other fine moments as well (most notably ""Highway Star""), but there is also a lot of mediocrity.If ""Live At The Olympia"" had been trimmed down to a single CD, it could have been a great album. As it is, it is a good album for serious fans, but more casual ones may not make it through disc I, and are much better served by sticking with ""Made In Japan""."
1,"Ok, Gene, you blew it.","Gene Simmons at least did not try todisguise the bare fact that this album suck...s. It all begin with the cover art. Ok, Gene, we all already know how you love women and money (who does not?), so you did not to put them in the cover...The songs follow the pattern of the album title. You must be an as...le to buy this album and feed Gene's greed. The songs themselves are really a hit and miss affair, with more misses of course."
1,"Gene,YOUR DAYS ARE LONG GONE","KISS are a very overated band that simply try to fool the minds of stupid people.It's all the same with KISS,they release a album then 2-3 weeks later it gets reduced then after a week theres some dumb bonus track added to it as well (except for the hit albums).Gene your lucky KISS fans are brainwashed and loyal to you because the rest of us wouldn't bother with your (...) merchanise even if it was for free."
2,"This album won't take my dollars away, no!","Ok, this self-proclaimed money-lover, greedy man won't see the colors of my hard earned dollars, because I've downloaded this album from suprnova.org.I usually try to separate the work of an artist from his personal life and character, but in the case of Gene this has become impossible to me, I'm sorry.This album is not utterly bad, it's just almos useless, the kind of album that you will listen one time, and then nevermore."
5,The Forgotten Filly,"This book is an entertaining one for younger readers. It goes through the period after Joelle's beloved mare Dance Away dies and Joelle turns to almost hating horses, especially Dancer's foal. She and her family, in the mean time, have to keep up their riding stable and help her paralyzed brother, Jeff, go through physical therapy.All in all, it was a good book, however really only satisfying for the younger set. Joelle was fully developed character, however her friends were completely flat, which is typical young girl and horse book. The book tugs at your emotions--if you don't like the way Joelle's treating the filly, that means that the author's done a great job at making those scenes pull at your heartstrings. Good job, definately worth a read."
4,I hope there is a sequel.,I really liked how realistic this book is. The ending disapointed me somewhat. I want to see Midnight go on and do horse shows. So a sequel would be just right.....
2,"why was there no shows, races or events?","this book had a good plot but no real story. the ending was disapointing, and I feel that most of the book was about Joelle and how she couldn't appriciate the fact that she had a pure thourghbred filly sitting in in a stall. But what really annoyed me was the fact that there was nothing at all about shows that she entered, nope, the book was about her feeling sorry for herself."
5,Para Empezar Interacciones,"This text is among the very best I have used. I have taken 4 years of Spanish in California; 15 years ago. The authors have done an extensive job of using color and relief layout which makes studying the text much easier on the eyes. The Spanish used in this text is very up to date. I mostly enjoyed the down to earth conversations used for examples. This particular text builds your working vocabulary quickly, easily and enjoyably.I would recommend this to other Spanish teachers to use even at the grade school and high school levels.I really like and enjoy the book. Good-bye to boring texts!Muchas gracias for all the research and practicality."
1,"Lacking, Lacking, Lacking","I just completed my first semester of Spanish using this book. Had it not been for my professor, I would have unsuccessfully finished. This book is full of cryptic grammar rules. The examples given are mediocre at best. I do have to say that it gives a lot of vocabulary...a good thing. This is my second language to study, so I do have experience with foreign language texts. If Mr. McAlpine would revise this book, it might me OK. Chapter 4 really needs to be split into two or three chapters.I would suggest getting a ""helping"" source if you must use this book."
5,Super!,"Let me just start by saying that I love the entire collection. Celine had really nice songs during that decade, and I think she deserves more recognition for them. Perhaps those songs should be put with all the hits she had in the 90s (English and French) together to form a box set. If it does happen, let's hope the collection includes ""Ce N'était Qu'un Rve"" and ""Incognito"". I ordered it used, however, and I'm afraid I made a big mistake in choosing to do so because one of the CDs is all scratch up causing me to have to skip three songs on it, so I am going to reorder the collection under another title: ""French Collection"". Since I love all the songs anyway, I will still give the compilation all the stars. For the amazon.com customer who purchased it and said that the album was bland, I guess he wasted his money. Maybe I should have bought it from him."
1,Limp,"It amazes me that people have rated this CD so highly. It is bland, bland, bland. Celine may have a ""smooth"" voice, but the songs are so vacuous, they cloy."
4,The key to the life I want,"This is an amazing book that describes exactly what the Christian life is all about. If every Christian could only learn what is on these pages, we would be a very different Church here on earth. The only downside to this book is that it spends a lot of time debating against what seems to be people who were teaching against the need for the Spirit at all. These people are no longer around, but the arguments against them are still useful, just not as needed as they were then. Overall a wonderful book."
1,Soundless Kelly,"This thing sounds like it was recorded using one mic covered by a blanket. Maybe because they just used the 5.1 sound and didn't adjust it for normal playback? Too bad, sounds like it would kick ass - if you could hear it."
3,Reckless Kelly was here,"Got a lot of music for the money, but the recording itself was not real sharp. Haven't looked at the dvd yet, hope that's not the same."
3,Pretty Good,"What I really love about the OM Yoga in a Box was that they have flash cards with actual people doing the yoga positions. However, the flash cards are really the only thing I ended up using. Although, if you're looking to buy a yoga strap, DVD/CD, candle and incense, then this is a really good deal for you."
5,Love it!,"I've had this for years now and I still use it and love it. There are a couple of moments of 'chanting' and such, but mostly it's just great instruction on positioning and relaxing and how to get the most out of the workout. And, it's nice if you want to do it in a low lit room for relaxation- no TV lighting up the place! I've done it to candlelight before!"
5,OMy Gosh! This is fun,I purchased OM Yoga in a box. This is a good beginning for those who can't make it to a class. The cards offer a visual reference and the stick figure drawings give the basics of each position. What a clever idea. I just love the incense that came with it too. My two little ones (3 and 5) have even joined in to do the yoga with me. Great starter kit!
3,Last Half Live Recordings,"This Is A pretty good disk But the last Half of the tracks were recorded live. I would've rather had the studio Recordings. I'm Writing this to inform you all, as I wish I Had been before purchase.This is still a good CD, Just not what I had expected.Go and Get Shock Troops instead."
5,IT WAS GREAT!,"Ok, so I had known about LEgendz for a long time, because I had come across it on a japanese website, and thought it was never coming here to america. IT did, and it rocks. It is good too, because the show in japan has little kids, this has older kids on it. I love the talispods and different legendz. I wish viz or whoever would come out with the talispods for us to play with, since they came out in japan. They can get the soul figures in vending machines like we have."
4,A good pump,I have had this pump running for about a year and find myself quite satisfied. The pump pumps air through an almost 48inch bubble wall hose and the other hook up currently just off gases as we don't need it at this time. Over all the pump is fairly quiet as long as it is balance properly. If the pump becomes unbalanced or leans against something it becomes quite loud as it vibrates quite a bit.
1,Nothing Silent About This One Folks,"Spent an extra 20 bucks on this airpump expecting by its name that it would be silent. WRONG, this little device buzzes even louder than my original 8 dollar air pump. Whats that all about?"
1,Not Silent.,"I bought this pump to avoid the annoying buzz sound most of these air pumps seem to make, unfortunately by ""silent"" they actually mean loud. I'd save your money and walk to the nearest pet store."
5,Concise,"I recently discovered how little I know about my own faith. This book is the second in a series of Penguin books on the history of the church. The author does an excellent job of providing an overview of the social setting of the middle ages and how the papacy, the East-West schism and the religious orders developed during this time period. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand more about how we got to where we are."
2,i loved the cover...,"i was really intrigued by the title and cover art. while trying to read it and make sense of it i became very confused and dismayed. it seemed it was written to be confusing to hide the fact of not being much of a cohesive story but a conglomeration of words strung together in the pretense of being above our understanding. unfortunately it falls short of what it could have been. the second half of the book, or the second book attached to the first was more enjoyable and made more sense. it just seems it could have been so much more. i had recently read ""satan burger"" and thought that it was so funny and well written that i would try another of the bizarro fiction. i would recommend skipping this and trying another."
2,intorductory med surg nursing,This book is too brief and does not explain rationales in detail. Subjects are scattered throughout the book which makes it difficult for studying.
2,Fairly bland,There is nothing outstanding about this book. The information is very complete but the layout/format is bland. There are few photographs and most images are in black and white/lineart. I'll use it because it is prescribed for the course but it wouldn't be a choice.
4,typical oil filter,"I couldnt see any difference between this and a k&n. But honestly who can? It do what it do and thats all that it do. and thats all I need it to do. Filter oil, that is."
3,this is NOT 11.8 inches,"I did not purchase this from amazon, but my intention is to save someone a headache. the wire length is very important for oxygen sensors. wire length affects voltage to the car's computer. naturally you want accuracy, that is why you're getting a new oxygen sensor. the wire length of this 15705 is around 5 inches or so. advanceautoparts.com lists this as having 11.81 inches. I bought it because I needed that length of wire, but this bosch is not 11.8 inches. there are other caravans that have the short-wired version. be careful and verify with bosch before you buy any oxygen sensor from any reseller."
5,Wiggles... Karaoke style!,"If you've ever wanted to sing The Wiggles at karaoke, well now's your chance! I picked this up one day not really knowing what it was, but I didn't own it. I gave it a listen and was plesantly surprised when I heard karaoke versions after each song. I'm a Wiggles fan and a karaoke fan which made this perfect! While I haven't had the chance to sing this one on a real karaoke machine, its a lot of fun to sing along to anyway. It's a lot of fun for those who know these songs inside and out. It's a really fun cd and the kids I've listened to it with have loved having the chance to sing the song themselves."
5,Astrlmax,This was a gift. It got there fast and without incident. The price was pretty good and they have a large selection. Good transaction!!
4,Turnaround is a page turner,"Read it! I was captured by the introduction alone. Branton brings you behind the pillars of city hall and exposes an otherwise great Mayor as an ambitious headline grabber (not that there is anything wrong with that). This book left me (a NJ to NYC commuter) that the 2 year sinking feeling of the relationship between the mayor and Commissioner was ""this town ain't big enough for both enough."" It is a shame. Branton delivers a biting biography that does not pull the proverbial punch."
4,"Not a ""good read"" but solid and interesting","If you're interested in the topic of police management, and effective police work in the community, this is a terrific book. Bratton is a very straightforward type, which makes him a terrific police administrator, and (with the help of an excellent co-author) not bad at explaining situations. Especially the complicated and tense problems of politics at high levels where a bad quote or misplaced humor can end one's career. Most fascinating to me were the chapters on how he turned around crime in the New York Subways when he was head of their special police force. Paying attention to small crimes, like fare evasion, made a huge difference. He also figured out how to back his men and help them work effectively. His accomplishment in reducing crime in New York City, helping police be effective and more honest, is extremely important. We hope to publish a Polish translation next year."
4,A very good autobiography from the former NYPD Commissioner!,"Although I am one who usually prefers academic policing books, I found this book really fascinating. Anyway, this book has some academic touches. He often mentions George Kelling, founder of the Broken Windows theory, and sometimes even touches on Broken Windows theory itself. Bratton has published academic articles (see his article ""Crime is Down : Blame the Police."").This book is an autobiography which was about his journey to becoming Commissioner of the NYPD. It is really fascinating. It would be interesting if he released a part 2 which would discuss his time with the LAPD. The book also shows his struggles, and that he had a hard time reaching his goal, yet he still reached it. A real inspiration. Recommended for anyone interested in policing."
5,terrific!,This book has helped me so much with honors high school chemistry and explains everything so clearly and the convenience of having 40 practice questions per chapter really helps me truly understand the concepts of each chapter. I recommend this book to anyone taking chemistry!!
2,not great,"This Dvd is not good for a beginner - especially if you are a woman. The ""instructors"" may be good dancers but they are not good instructors.They do not spend enough time on the basics and barely show the woman's part at all.I am very disappointed."
3,Background Music DJ CD Note: Also out of date CD-ROM,"These remixes can be used for special purpose, like to use asbackground music for annoucements in a radio station, like the advertisements for night clubs. This a good for the moble DJ who needs something different. Please Note for XP users: This CD-ROM on the disc requires Windows 95, great for older machines. Still a good background CD."
5,outstanding,It was recomended to me and oh were they on target. You can relate to this if you are wanting to get closer and see the real world of Heaven. I can totally relate to this as I am a prayer warrior. On fire for Him.Read this and grow.
5,a MUST READ for any christian,"This book is a manual a how-to get into God`s Presence often and experience MORE . The book is not just a teaching but a prophetic teaching that draws from the authors life attitude , experiences, bible revelation and more . The book is a challenging catalyst to throw off the mediocre or traditionally accepted and literally , literally meet the Lord because Jesus has opened the door to God`s glorious , heavenly dimension NOW ."
5,It made my spirit rise within me!,"This book IS what God is doing in our generation. With every word I read, my heart pounded with anticipation of the next words. I truly believe anyone who wants to know Him in His fullness will find Him in this book! Thank you for this and for your books River Glory and Revival Glory!"
5,Revelatory !!! Life Changing. From a Senior Pastor,"WOW !!!! So many things I have experienced in the Spirit but was a fraid to tell anyone because of fear of being thought of as ""Out there."" After reading this book I discovered that God is dealing with many people in the same realms. As a Senior Pastor I fully reccomend this great book"
1,Is it silent?,I purchased this product because I wanted a silent air pump and was disappointed with it for that reason.
1,Barbarian With A Big Vocabulary,"I define a barbarian as one who believes war is the answer and war is the solution. Individuals like V.H.D. are nothing more than intelectual, university insulated, souless cheer-leaders for war. This book is simply a Ra! Ra! for war. Victor loves war, this war, past war, any war America has ever or will ever be in (except humanitarian uses of the military, those he staunchly opposes). If you like the Iraq war, support the Iraq war, then you will love V.H.D., in short, you are a barbarian."
1,Between Rush & mush: Non-lessons from a classical education,"If Hanson wants to claim a scholarly foundation for his political drivel, he would do well to discover something about the histories of Afghanistan and Iraq and the effects of British and U.S. (and Soviet/Russian) interference in these countries. Unfortunately, neither his knowledge of the region nor his expectations for stupendous ""coalition"" success in the warmongering that has taken place since 9-11 provide the reader with much reason to waste money on this example of Rush-mush when you can get the same thing on talk radio or ""fair and balanced"" FOX News on a nightly basis for free -- and with similar effects on a naive mind. A UCSC education was wasted, and California tax-payers should demand their money back!!"
4,Exhausting,"I enjoy reading virtually anything written by Victor Davis Hanson.In this collection of essays, Hanson rails against the left and their constant harping on the USA. He is so good at ripping people apart with words that you may start rooting for the other guy because you feel bad for them.Personally, I'll continue to read his essays (they are REALLY good) but will avoid such a concentrated dose in the future.A great book, but probably should be spread out over time to avoid exahaustion."
3,Love's Wild Desire not so Wild,"This is one of Blake's earlier works, originally published in 1977. While it promised at first to be ""steamy"", with the opening duel, and subsequent rape scene early on, this book does not quite measure up to some of her later works. Except for that one rape scene, sex was not explicit. Although I loved the character of Rafael, he is not developed as thoroughly as could have been possible. Some actions of the story likne were only talked about, and not shown first hand, which would have been more effective. Especially lacking were scenes showing Rafe's grief when he thought Catherine had drowned. Overall, however, I am always impressed by Blake's knowledge of the history of the area and the different cultures that exist along the Mississippi, in Natchez and New Orleans. One can see just how much Jennifer Blake has improved as a writer over the years, by comparing this book and others, such as LUKE and ROAN, and PRISONER OF DESIRE."
1,The Male Protagonist Is A Rapist And A Kidnapper,"What kind of sick fantasy is this, to make a psychopathic rapist and a kidnapper sympathetic, not to say desirable to the female heroine?"
1,Dictionary was missing pages,"I was so disappointed with this purchase. The book was advertised as having 1800 pages, but when I received it, I realized that it only had about half that amount, 800. The missing pages were not the result of someone tearing out the pages, but rather a publisher defect. There were letters of the alphabet that were completely nonexistent. I didn't bother returning it because it wasn't worth the shipping cost. I order many items from amazon, but this was the most misleading and disappointing item yet."
4,Quantum leap for the Fall,"It's a real joy to listen to Live at the Witch Trials, Dragnet, Grotesque, Slates, and Hex Enduction Hour, in that order. You see the Fall's evolution and non-evolution quite clearly - a process that continues to this day. Hex combines the muscle of Witch Trials with the lo-fi recording techniques of Dragnet and Grotesque, to great effect. Some of these songs get airborne in a big, lumbering way, thanks to the two drummers. Others have that creepy ooze of many ""softer"" Fall songs. For new converts, I can't think of a better introduction to the Fall. It's an early enough album that they weren't an institution yet, it does show a leap forward in terms of development, it covers all the bases that they have visited time and again over the years, and per the liner notes, it f*cking rocks! No band has ever done so much with so little. Play loud."
1,"A note from the author, Patricia Johnston","There are no new editions of this title for sale. My copy right was returned to me 6/12/06 by Publish America. It may appear contrary to that fact, due to the slow process of data update.Thank you,Patricia JohnstonAKA Patricia Winters Johnston"
4,This book is excellent,"I reserve 5 stars for really life changing books, but this one makes me want to bend my own rules. It's really a great book for anyone doing serious mod_perl work. Stas and Eric know mod_perl and pass along a ton of great information.This book is sitting by my desk side as I port an existing web based application from traditional Perl to mod_perl. I know I'll be diving back into it frequently. Whether you're getting ready to use mod_perl, or already using it, I'd heartily recommend this book for everyone on your team."
5,As the title suggests,"This is very practical. It starts with a lot of information on how apache works and how mod_perl and other modules intract. Then, after learning that information, it shows how you can use the knowledge to signficiantly improve the performance of your mod_perl apps.In addition, it gives valuable advice on how to troubleshoot fustrating issues with mod_perl & apache.This book should be required reading for anybody doing mod_perl work."
2,A Vintage Religious Rip Off,"I watched this film after I watched ""Earthquake"". For some reason, I was curious about the actor Marjoe Gortner. While the film was interesting, I wasn't impressed with the moral aspect of it. Here was a man who used the faith and trust that innocent (perhaps foolish) people put in him to simply make money. I felt bad for the hundreds of people who were filmed handing over their hard earned cash to him.While I understand that his parents trained him to be a pint-sized preacher - his only interest, as an adult, was to be the center of attention. This could have been a much better film if he came clean with his audience while he was standing in front of them and let them know how he felt about what he was doing.I am not a religious person, but I do believe in being honest with people. He abused their trust by not being honest and then by making more money on the film."
2,Boring,"Eh. Marjoe's not particularly captivating (which one would assume the opposite of), nor is the editing/storytelling great."
2,Wanted to love it but just too chunky,"I gave it 3 tries, trying the settings, varying amounts of ice. It just chunked the ice out too big for our tastes. To me, and perhaps I am spoiled, a slushie should have smaller ice bits."
5,Ice Shaver,I bought this item for my granddaughter and grandson last summer. We have had many hours of fun making the snow cones so they could share with their friends. It is easy to use and cleans well. Would reccommend this for anyone.
3,Low power,"If you aren't in a hurry to get crushed Ice, then this is your product. It doesn't seem to have the power needed to crush ice quickly. However, the kids like it and the price was right, so..."
2,Just doesn't work that great - and I really tried!,"Bought this based on all the good reviews. Even tried the tips some of the reviewers left. Unfortunately, this ice shaver just doesn't work that great, at least not for me. Sometimes it just won't shave the ice. I tried switching back and forth between slushie and snow cone settings like one reviewer suggested, but it still doesn't shave it. It's like the ice isn't being pushed down on the blade enough for it to shave it. If I stick with it, continually removing the lid to reposition the ice cubes, eventually I get enough ice for ONE small snow cone. That's just too much work for one little cup of shaved ice!"
2,Doesn't work well at all,"Perhaps if you are making a large batch of slushys for a large group - this might work OK. I bought it to make frozen diet shakes for myself - using 4 - 6 ice cubes. It can't ""catch"" the cubes !! I tried 3 different shapes of ice cubes - and no difference. You have to constantly fiddle with it to get the blade to catch the cubes - starting / stopping / restarting / waiting / repositioning the cubes - etc. Then it catches for 5 seconds - then stops - and you do it all over again. The slush produced when it does catch is great. But the constant fiddling to get it to work is frustrating and unacceptable !! To replace it - I bought the Tribest Single Serving Blender/Grinder PB-250 from Amazon!! For a single serving application - it works perfectly !! A very good single serving mixer - and it crushes the ice as well - all in one quick and easy application. And then you just flip it over and drink it out of the mixing container !!"
1,very disappointed.,"1st item didn't work,had to be sent back to company. 2nd item arrived was really excited as it was meant to be a christmas present but very disappointed, this machine is rubbish. have brought a 3rd from a differnet company works brilliantly and is in the style of 1950's which looks great.Would definitely not recommend product."
4,Not quick but does the job,"I read the reviews months ago, and hesitated to buy the Icy Treats Ice Shaver because of too many bad reviews. Well, I finally decided to take a chance because I haven't found a comparable slushee maker in this price range. It shaves ice - noisy, takes time, sometimes jams. But the end result is a nice pitcher of shaved ice using whatever ice you throw in the hopper. The Icy Treats ice shaver does not require special ice cubes from provided cups as some other ice shavers do. You can select between a finer grind (slushee) and coarser grind (snow cone). I have used my Icy Treats only twice so no idea how rugged it is. Am I happy that I bought it? Yes, it makes nice icy treats that you can flavor however you wish. Could I live without it? Certainly, although I am looking forward to making a variety of sugar-free icy drinks - with and without alcohol for ""flavoring"". If I buy a Slushee at the local convenience store, I am limited to whatever syrups they use."
5,Pleased,"The ice shaver is very satisfactory. It will shave enough ice cubes for one or two servings in 5-10 minutes. For parties, you might want to do ahead of time & freeze. The appliance is sturdy."
4,The ice works great for refreshing drinks of summer.,It works alot better than an osterizer. The shaved ice makes refreshing drinks of summer. It makes a good amount of shaved ice in about 2 or 3 minutes. To keep the noise low I put a towel over it and it works good. It is easy clean up too.
3,Delicious Results,"Makes great frosty drinks and treats but it is a little tricky to balance. Almost think it is missing a part because you need to hold constantly from start to finish. Yes, it is noisy but shaving ice isn't quietly done. The end results are wonderful. I'd give it a 5 if I didn't have to hold the bottom on all the time."
5,Best home slushi machine ever,"I'm a huge slush-puppie fan and decided to order this little guy based on the reviews and price. Since receiving it a few days ago, I've been extremely satisfied. It's very simple to use and clean, and produces excellent shaved ice. I'm also quite surprised how fast it makes it. For the quality and price, you will not find better machine!Also, to make a slushi just like the blue raspberry slush-puppie, mix it with Berry Bonkers Hawaiian Punch (one of the harder flavors to find, but I get mine at Shaws). The very similar taste together with the great shaved ice makes it virtually indistinguishable. As a result, I couldn't be happier."
5,Works as advertised -- great!,"This can turn a full ice cube tray into 2 cups of shaved ice in under 3 minutes. That's how quickly you can have margaritas or daiquiris for 2. :-)I got this just in time for the 4th of July weekend. I put some fruit in the freezer Friday night: cubed cantaloupe, strawberries, mango slices. By noon Saturday, they were all frozen solid. This made fruit slushies very easily. The mango did't shred, but was shaved into thin slices. Not what I expected but still great when mixed with some shaved ice and alcohol, LOL."
3,It doesn't shave right away..,"i have to stop the machine several times to rearrange the ice cubes to make them shave. it's a little disappointed, however, i do get the final slushie after some adjustments with the ice cubes.amie chi - ny"
3,Does not stand up to heavy usage.,"Worked well for a few days, though it was slow and loud and and the ice dispenser didn't have any sort of a spout. Then it started shaving less and allowing bigger chunks of ice through.Problem is, it does not stand up to heavy usage. I gave it 3 stars because it isn't expensive and for occasional usage it would be OK. Anything more I would suggest spend more and get a better item.A tip: use this machine to create the ice and a smoothie blender to mix everything together. This way you get nice smoothies free of big ice chunks!"
4,slushie snow cone maker,"We got this for my daughter's 7th birthday after the dog destroyed her toy slushie maker last year. We haven't had it that long but it has already become a big hit with my daughter and her friends. It is easy enough for them to use yet a sturdy appliance. For the price and what we wanted it for, this has been a good product so far."
4,Shaves Ice Fast! Use Ice Cubes straight from the freezer,"The Hamilton Beach Ice Shaver is faster and quiter than other models I have used. It holds one standard ice cube tray of cubes in the hopper, turn it on and in about 30 to 40 seconds you have shaved ice.Being able to use cubes directly from the freezer is a big plus since we make ice at least twice a day.Frankly I can't tell much difference between the slushy and snow cone setting the snow cone setting seems to produce slightly larger flakes of ice than the slushy setting. My other half prefers the slushy setting he says it takes slighly longer for the slushy bits to melt in the mouth.Over all very satisfied with the ice shaver."
5,Great little ice shaver,I recently bought this ice shaver. I have been very pleased overall with this product since I use it almost every day. The slushy ice isn't as fine as I had hoped but the ice does hold soda flavor at the bottom of a freezy mug for some time. The Icy Treats Maker is compact and that is great when counter space is limited. I use covered ice cube trays because my ice maker is lame and the cubes have a funny taste. I have not had a problem with ice cubes jamming the mechanism. I like it so much I am going to get one for my mother in law. She loves icy drinks too.
2,Slow,"Bought the item after reading the reviews. Thought it was going to work great. The machine does not work well when you use the the ice from the freezer without crushing it first. Even after crushing, the machine is slow to produce slushie/ ice shaver. It is a noisy. Would not recommended. Skip this machine and look for something else. I saw a margarita machine that a friend has, it make a quick slushie. Going to give that one a try."
2,Could be better.,I purchased this model because it used regular ice cubes and not a mold of ice. It took at least 15 minutes to grind the ice for 1 icee. I kept having to stop the machince to rearrange the ice just to get it to shave. Very annoying when you have 2 little ones anxiously waiting for thier snow cone. I am most likely going to return this and try to find a better model.
3,"Makes Finely crushed ice, not exactly a snow cone!",Length:: 0:22 MinsIts easy to use and clean up. doesnt make much noise. and works fine using regular ice cubes. but its not super fine shaved ice like you can get with a commercial machine. watch the video.
1,"Constantly jams, not stong enough","This was my third try with an inexpensive ice shaver. Guess I gotta spend some bucks to find an ice shaver that actually works, although when I was a kid, I remember my Snoopy hand-crank ice shaver worked pretty good.So my fridge makes crescent shaped cubes, like most fridge ice-makers. No go with those in this thing, so I used the 'crushed' setting on my fridge dispenser, and tried that instead. No go with that either. Maybe I read the label wrong, maybe this is a cheese shaver, cause it can't handle ice at all.This thing jams within 1-2 seconds and uses a cheap stationary blade that can't hack it."
1,piece of junk,I was excited to finally have a great ice shaver. Unfortunately this was not it. I tried several ways to get it to work and they all failed. This is probably the worst piece of junk I ever purchased. It was extremely noisy and bounced around. If I held part of it at an angle the whole time it would eventually shave a bit of ice. This is a definite DON'T BUY.
2,"Works great, but...",I love making slushies out of all my favorite drinks so this ice shaver is awesome to have during the summers. The only problem is that it breaks every year. Ive already replace it for two years. I think i'm going to try a different brand this year and hope it lasts.
4,Good product,"Use it a lot. Does a good job. First one broke a blade after about six months but lasted thru a lot of use. For the money, I think it's fine. I bought a second one."
4,Shaved ice maker,"This is a really cool product if you want to make slushies or sno cones. It's just a bit more noisy than I expected but for me, I'm having a loud party so it won't really matter but if you are having a nice and quiet event then I would look for something else. Other than that, I love it!"
2,Not the best ice shaver,"Bought this to use for margaritas and slushies, but the ice didn't really shave well, and I ended up making them in a blender instead. I was just glad I didn't end up offering it for a recent event at my hubby's work where we would have made shaved ice for a dozen or so kids. I think this will take up space in my pantry closet until I finally garage sale it."
3,Slushy Maker,This ice shaver did not make the ice as small as I had anticipated. I thought the ice would be much finer in size and texture and more like the slushies you get at the convenience stores. It also was fairly noisy while chopping the ice.It is easy for a child to operate and will be good for icy treat snow cones in the summer.
1,Aggravating Product,"This unit did not crush ice very well for me. It was quite a task. Usually the ice had to get softer for it to work. I have only used the half moon shaped cubes. After they softened a while it seemed to work OK, but I have dreaded getting this thing out and wrestling with it every time my little ones want some shaved ice. I have used other models that worked much better and have not ditched this unit in favor of a better performer. I think there are much better designs that this one that work much better."
3,Pretty good for the price,Sometimes you have to open it up and adjust the position of the ice cubes. Other than that it does a pretty good job for the price. It is very simple to operate. I use ice cubes from an automatic ice maker (semi circle shape).
4,Good Ice Shaver,"Bought this for a BBQ party. Wasn't sure this would keep up with the amount of people who attended, but it did. A full mixing bowl made enough shaved ice for 3 small bowls. It is safe and easy enough that my little 10 year old cousin ended up being our slushie/snow cone maker. It was such a hit, 2 relatives just asked if they can borrow it for their upcoming parties."
2,Not so great.,I was looking forward to this little gizmo for making snow cone type treats with my niece. It's inconsistent at best and takes a long time to shave a small amount of ice. I'm not exactly sure what causes it to work and then not (using the same type of ice cubes each time) but I found that you frequently have to stop and adjust the ice to get it going again. I think I'm going to pass it on to my niece as she seemed entertained by it but I will go back to using my cusinart's grating disc when I need shaved ice.
5,the best out there..but brakes too eazy,this is one of the gratest ice crushers i have been abel to find the price is right and for 2 months worked beter then i hoped... but as the nautre of the beast. the shaft broke. now craters are willing to send me a new one as there is no replacement part. for just $6 for s&h. its worth it..not ment for squeare ice must be small moon shaped ice. but all in all im buying another
3,Vey poor design on plastic rotating pin!!!!!,"I now have purchased three of the machines. They are junk. One lasted a year and broke (of course out of warranty) I purchased 2 new ones. one last one day. sent plug end in and received another new one under warranty. The 2nd new one has now broke (the center rotating pin ). I like the machines, but cannot afford to own them any more. It would be a simple fix for their engineers, but the would rather have dissatisfied customers.I will not own another until they redesign the center rotating pin on this snow cone machine. Their should be law suit put against them and recall on all their snow cone machines. When you call them they act like it is a surprise to them but it not they know their putting out junk! Hope this helps !"
3,Disappointing if you want fine ice,This ice machine works great if you are making slushies or just want chipped ice. I wanted to replace my other ice machine (Rival) which makes very fine snow like ice.On the upside. This ice machine works fast and works without the user holding down a button... so you can do something else while ice is making. It tends to get stuck a lot and you have to readjust the piece of ice so it will keep shaving it. Good value for the price. Good for snow cones. It is kind of loud.
3,"Hamilton beach 68050 Icy Treats ice Shaver, White","Does a great job shaving ice, almost perfect. But made of cheap plastic, so if you use it daily, like I did, it will probably break within a year. It did for me. :)"
4,Nice product,"This item works well. The only reason I am giving it a 4 rating is because it is very loud. Other than that, it works well."
3,Loud and Slow,The ice is great but it is very loud and takes a while to create enough ice for a drink or snow cone!
2,Not Worth The Money,"I couldn't get it to shave ice so I called the customer support. They patiently helped me get it to shave. When I tried it myself I had take it apart and put it back together more than once to get it to work. This is what the customer service woman had me do. If I have to do it almost every time I use it, it is not worth the money paid for it.My grandson finally got it to work well...then when trying to turn the container at the bottom to remove it, the stem holding the mixing bar broke off making the container useless. I guess we can still use one of our own bowls to catch the ice from now on. Still not worth what I paid for it."
4,Coarse grind but fast and convenient,"Does not make shaved ice. More like chipped ice in two versions. Coarse and coarser. It is consitently finer than an ice crusher though. I still like it and use it. The things I like about it is the large hopper on top that I fill with regular ice cubes, the large container that collects a large amount of chipped ice, no mess, fast and easy to use."
1,Total junk,"I received my unit on March 12, 2012. Worked for about 35 seconds and then it just died. Worthless junk."
3,chilly,"got this for my hubby and he loves using it, especially in the summer months when it's hot and you don't really want to have a drink."
2,not worth the time and effort,"didn't like too noisy,took forever to shave one tray of ice.I guess if you started really early to shave ice for a kids snow cone it might be allriught for a summer treat."
3,Hardly a snow cone,"I thought this would make ""snow cone type"" ice. Our blender does a much better job making fine ice. Not worth it. Use a blender."
5,Great Machine!,So easy ~ a child can operate it! We used it a lot this summer when the weather was so hot!
1,Great design with a weak link,"I recently purchased this ice shaver and really enjoyed it for a few days. It works well, is super easy to disassemble and clean, and I was starting to think about creative concoctions when .. clunk! ... the central post on the turning ice holder broke off and the thing was instantly rendered useless. That center post is screwed in but the little plastic neck in which the screw sits can't possibly take the rugged jiggling of ice and scraper for long, it seems. Too bad; fatal design flaw."
1,Did not shave - Returning,"I bought this machine for my wife. She was grateful until she tried to shave some ice. Using cubes from our icemaker, the results were terrible. Only a few tablespoons of slush after several minutes of running. Tried various numbers of cubes with the same results. So we tried the crushed ice from our icemaker... same poor results.She bought some ice trays figuring that might be the solution. She froze some cubes and hoped for different results. Wrong again!!I bought this machine because of the positive results I read here. But our machine is now boxed up to be returned for a refund."
1,What a piece of junk!,This is a complete waste of money. I have one and it does nothing but frustrate me. I tried it twice and both times it shaved about a tablespoon or two of ice before jamming. It is useless. I can't believe Hamilton Beach would actually sell something which operates so poorly. I use ice from cubes made in my freezer- not purchased or made by an ice machine which someone else suggested could be the problem. It's packed in my garage to go into the trash next cleanup day. I wouldn't even try to get rid of it for one dollar at a garage sale!
3,Work but Noisy,The machine work but kind of noisy and a lot of vibration. Easy to clean and safety lid is a good idea.
3,Ice chips not shaved ice,"The ice maker is fun for the kids and has worked well for over two years, but it makes tiny crunchy ice chips, not true shaved ice. I'm upgrading to a Hawaiian Ice shaver for finer shaving. The Hamilton Beach is pretty sturdy, my older kids can use it on their own, and love it. However, it's really noisy (not sure if a quiet ice shaver even exists), and again, does not shave ice finely. The ""snow"" in sno-cones does not come from a shaver like this one."
4,It does what it's supposed to.,"Shaved Ice -- checkSlushies -- checkPerfect for household use. It takes regular ice cubes so there's no waiting for water to freeze. It holds about 2 cups of ice at a time. It's noisy, but I haven't met an ice shaver or crusher that isn't. Easy Clean and Dry. I've had it about a month and used it daily. So far I'm a happy camper"
1,Don't Waste Your $$$$,I bought this item and I have already returned it so thought I might help you not waste your $$$$. When I ordered it the delivery was perfect and exactly as expected. As soon as I unpackaged the ice shaver I saw the cutting blades are PLASTIC and not able to deal with any ice cube or piece of ice cube I tried. When my husband tried to operate it the ice shaved so slow it allowed the shavings to melt before there was enough ice shavings for even one drink. On top of everything it is SO NOISY we could not hear each other while we were next to the machine while it struggled to operate. The return was without any problem and I will continue to shop at Amazon any time I can but this product is nothing like the promises made by the manufacturer.
1,broke in two weeks,"motor broke in two weeks i email twice no response ,Hamilton Beach 68050 Icy Treats Ice Shaver, White"
3,"It's ok, but don't expect too much!",i was excited to get this machine but found out that it does not like to crush hard ice. it works better with the softer ice.
2,It busted after 30 days,"THe main shaft that holds it all together busted after less than 30 days use. My wife used it, and it broke. I'm not real happy and need to buy another. I'm not sure I'll buy one of these again, but I need one. I was real disappointed in the fashion that a single screw threads into a plastic shaft and when it breaks, the whole unit is useless. Poor design. Otherwise it works very nicely and grinds ice up good. But design and fabrication, I'd give it a zero."
5,firefighterwife,"We bought this for our 10-year-old for Christmas, but everyone in our family uses it. It is very easy, fast, and the ice is perfect for our snow cones. We pull it out weekly for a tasty treat. Great buy!"
5,Pleased with product,"My 8 year old daughter wanted this for Christmas. Based on reviews, I bought this brand. Very pleased with it. We've only used the snow cone setting but it is light and fluffy like snow. Very easy to clean. Great value for the price."
4,Yum!,"Really easy to use. Some other reviewers mentioned that the ice cubes from a standard freezer don't work because of their curve but ours are working fine 90% of the time. When one gets hung up, a little shake usually gets them unstuck."
5,Great,"I just got this as a Christmas present and I love it. It's freezing cold outside and I still make snow cones and slushies. It works great and fills a glass with "" snow"" in about a minute. This machine will work great for the carnival I plan to host this summer. I highly recommend this item. Thanks again Mrs. Depart"
2,Great Expectations!!!!,"I purchased this item in the hopes that I wouldn't have to use an iron. I found that it couldn't replace one. It took a considerable time to steam a shirt.The product was easy to ensemble and I was using it in 15 minutes. It certainly takes away the wrinkle but there are parts of the shirt that can be difficult to steam;for example, the collar.I guess it would be great for things like curtains, etc.I give the low rating based on the fact I wanted it to replace an iron."
2,Dangerous,"Dangerous, clumsy, doesnt adequately remove wrinkles even on thin items of clothing. Hard to use without steaming yourself. I recommend getting yourself a nice iron."
5,Baroque Harpsichord,"Diana Petech plays a copy of a 1730 Blanchet harpsichord in a performance of sonatas from ""Sonates pour le clavessin sur le gout italien"", Op.1, and ""Sonate per il cembalo solo"", Op.4, by Giovanni Benedetto Platti (1690-1763).The works on this recording:1. Sonata No. 2 in C major, Op. 12. Sonata No. 4 in G minor, Op. 13. Sonata No. 2 in C minor, Op. 44. Sonata No. 5 in C minor, Op. 45. Sonata No. 6 in C major, Op. 46. Sonata No. 4 in A minor, Op. 4"
1,Stupid,"My son received this book and ""Shhh!"" for his first birthday and I immediately got rid of them. This book is poorly written, uncreative, and the storyline is just simply stupid. This book will in no way nourish a child's mind."
1,A Thousand Frightening Fantasies: Understanding and Healing,"I suppose that because the book states that it is written for laymen I should have not been so disappointed by it. However I did expect more. I think that the book is sketchy, and too many ideas are only hinted at without some depth of explanation. The idea that the author discovered links to the past regarding the topic is interesting, but the material throughout the book is poorly integrated. However if the book provides relief to scrup/ocd sufferers, I praise it for that!"
4,A Classic.,"Make sure you get the version with his letter to his son at the very beginning. I picked up this book many years ago thinking I may never read such a boring looking tome. However, when I read this letter I was touched to my core and I knew that anyone who could write such a deeply moving and beautiful letter must be worth reading. And boy, was I right. What astounds me is that later publishers have omitted this letter, thus demonstrating how ignorant, daft and insensitive they are. Get the letter version. You will see what I mean."
4,Good old-fashioned Willie!,"If you want to own some classic Willie Nelson, this is a good CD for you. Some of his best is on this CD, and the sound is pure and true. I especially enjoyed the photos which capture Willie through the years. I have been a loyal fan for 30 years, and he has never disappointed me. There's nothing new on this album, but classics speak for themselves."
2,It's okay...,"I'm looking for a list of vocabulary words that middle school kids should be knowledgable in for success in high school, and for setting the groundwork for vocabulary they will need for the ACT/SAT in the future. In addition, they need to be vocabulary proficient for the California CST. This didn't quite give me what i wanted. I found that 504 Words You Should Know (okay, i don't have the book here to look at the title) was a much more useful source."
5,Good child's life vest,Bought this for my granddaughter to wear on the boat. Fits a small child well. Seems to be well made.
4,good book,"Book has a lot of good ideas, patterns and clear instructions. You do, however, need to buy a lot of templates to make the quilts in the book."
5,So Many Possibilities!,I ordered this book for a class and am very excited with all of the possibilities for fabric and patterns. Your imagination will go wild with the color selections and designs. I haven't sewn curves for quite some time and these templates made it very easy to accomplish. Directions are explicit and I have used fabrics in my stash that I never thought would go into a quilt. I will definitely make more than one of these. Go for it. Such fun and yours will be an original.
5,Strips and Curves,This book is really good. It shows and explains things very well. I was in a group of people doing a class with this book and templates. It went well. Everyone's was different. And no one was having any problems understanding how it all worked. :)
3,a little disappointed,"i was waiting for this series for a while now and when it finally arrived and i watched it, i was a little disappointed. First of all, and don't like the actress who plays as sakura, her voice doesn't go well with the character and syaoran and sakura don't show much emotions,to top it off the show drags, they've gotten 3 or 4 feathers in 26 episodes?! The only reason i'm going to finish watching the anime is because i've already started watching it."
5,Excellent Music !,"This Compact Disc is Awesome. I highly recommend everyone that enjoys listening to deep house music, to purchase it. - Thank You!"
1,Waste of time and money,"I purchased this book expecting to get a complete listing of values for autographs of celebrities and athletes. What I got was nothing more than a reproduction of the listings that Beckett includes in its monthly publications. With the exception of about 200 prices for celebrity autographs (which is a far cry from the thousands you would find in other publications), this book has nothing that you can't get in a monthly issue of Beckett. It may have a few nice pictures, but that does not make up for its lack of content. And the prices are obscene! Is a Dean Cain sig worth more than Willie Mays? Or for that matter is Dean Cain worth more than Jack Nicholson? Where do they get their information? They spend way too much time listing prices for autograph inserts manufactured by card companies, and not enough time listing prices for REAL autographs obtained by collecters. Can I get my twenty-five bucks back?"
5,Better than I remembered,"What can I say? I remember Dr. Hook from back in the day. Heard this CD at a friend's house one night and thought, ""Wow, this is better than I remember!"" Had to buy it for myself. Thanks, Dr. Hook. Great collection."
5,"Dr. Hook still sounding ""The sweetest of all""","This collection is everything i wanted, i grew up hearing songs my mum & dad would play, they still have Dr.Hook on vinyl(Pleasure& Pain)and many more Dr. Hook albums .I bought it as a gift for them, now i have it more than them LOL so i have to get my own copy, disk 1 has all the tracks i love disk 2 is a new world of songs for me ,for sure a must buy, if you want to back track your musical library with the greatest hits, make sure to put Collection by Dr.Hook high up on your list."
4,Steps Ahead is the reason to buy this,Steps Ahead is the Gem; Ritenour is the lemon. Don't buy this for Ritenour buy this for Steps Ahead. Brecker shines on this. If you like EWI then this is a must buy.
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED !!,"These roses were supposed to be part of a very romantic Valentines Day for my wife of 35 years and I. When the box arrived I eagerly opened it, only to find that the roses had literally been thrown into an empty box, with no packing material or water source. They looked terrible!! As I attempted to arrange them into a bouquet (3 times), I found that there were at least 3 stems that were so wilted and deformed that I did not include them. The packing instructions indicated that the roses were ""hybernating""... Yah right, and Ruffles have ""flavor curls!!!"""
4,English-Tagalog Visayan Dictionary,"It was useful for my brother when he went to the Philippines. Even he already had a interpreter, his friends also could have another source."
3,Not the 'book of books' yet but it will get you started,The name 'Bible' means 'book of books' this isn't the 'book of books' on Jbuilder. One should go elsewhere to learn Java. This book should focus more heavily on building applications using JBuilder step by step. Unfortunatly there isn't any out there yet...hmmm maybe I should write it!!
4,A good introduction to Java and JBuilder,"I found this book to very useful to quickly learn Java.I was in a bind, and needed to learn quickly and away from the computer. The throrough steps and provided screenshots made learning Java without the computer possible. I read the first 60% of the book in three days, got back to the computer, and was producing basic applets in no time.I don't think, however, that it's appropriate to call this book a bible as a ""Bible"" book to me covers many general subjects, whereas this is more of a ""Learn Java in XX days"" type of book."
2,OOPS not JBuilder,"I grabbed this book because I needed all the dope on JBuilder fast. This is not the book. It appears ( and I must admit that once I realized this book was not going to fulfill my requirements, I stopped reading it) that this is a nice introduction to OOP in java, but says little about JBuilder!?!?!? If this book had a different title, it would probably get more than two stars."
2,I'll try to be nice,"JBuilder2 Bible is not so hot. When I first received the book, I read the intro on how to create a project. Ten minutes later I put it down. This book is elementary and has an extremely limited scope of JBuilder2. You will find the Borland JBuilder2 help file quantitatively more informative and just as friendly."
2,Not a good JBuilder book for business applications.,"Aside from the missing quotation marks, which indicates a distinct lack of professional publishing, overall this book is poorly organized. The author explains exceptions before he even touches loops or conditional statements. An explaination of the 'if' statement comes on page 255! If I was a true beginner, I don't think I would be able to use this book at all. The author spends approximately 200 pages and 4 chapters on two example programs. These are very large programs with no real-life applications. I think these pages could have been used to present smaller, more digestable examples rather than these two titantic programs."
3,Probably worth the money...,"I was anticipating that this book would be either an excellent reference or an excellent tutorial, chock full of examples. However, my expectations were not met. The examples are somewhat difficult to follow - I found myself skipping around through chapters. Also, this is not a ""definitive guide"", my mind is still quite hungry for information.To say good, I do think the book is a decent ""jump start"" for someone new to Java programming (me). Part I and Part II really helped get me going."
2,Misleading title for basically a Java and OO book,"I was expecting a Bible to provide a good reference about the subject it intends to cover. However, the book has only superficial information about JBuilder and instead focuses on other topics.If you are looking for a 'good' and 'advanced' reference to JBuilder, this is not the right book."
3,"Oh, for want of a quotation mark!",The fact that the text of the book is missing all the single and double quotes can be dishearting for the beginner trying to make the programs work! The book was written with the total beginner in mind but the topics like loops and conditional expressions need to be addressed by another book that allocates more time and exercises to key areas. I find the book very helpful in learning the JBuilder environment for the intermediate programmer (that is a person with one programming langauge under their belt and some knowledge of Java). Overall I have found it beneficial and plan on finishing up the book. I don't recommend it for anyone who wants to actually learn Java (there are better books) and it doesn't touch database programming (see JBuilder Essentials). The lack of quotes is irritating but manageable.
1,hmmm...not quite what you expect...,"after reading many of stasheff's other books like wizard in rhyme series and the warlock series...i've been rather attached to the light-heartedness of his books.the star stone story, however, is strangely not of this style. instead it is of the serious fantasy mould and what have you? a book that ought to be given a miss. borrow this book from the library instead.the tale is of lomallin, who seeks to avenge the elder race, for his wife's death. no new elements in this tale, and neither engaging nor humourous. i really can't quite get the point the author is trying to put across with this book. purchase at your own risk! :o)"
1,I don't think I've read a book this bad in a long time.,"Well, I got to liking Stasheff after his fairly light-hearted easy-reading (but very fun) Warlock series (Rod Gallowglass and friends). I thought I'd try a different flavour of the author, and boy, do I wish I hadn't - this book is lifeless, without character, and woodenly written. It's better used as a sandwich filling, if you don't mind cardboard. Just say no."
5,"Etheral Rythms, Touching Lyrics","At first listen, I didn't know how to digest this album's music. I wasn't exactly sure what genre it was trying to fit into...but I started to realize that it's ok if it doesn't fit. It feeds off of raw emotion. And she manages to capture the things that are in our minds and hearts in the deepest of hours. After a few listens, I realized that this is a beautiful piece of work. Each song speaks to, ever so softly, like a sweet lullabye. I love the understatedness of it...and that is rarely said about an album! So, buy it. Don't try to mold it or overly critize it...listen to it with open ears and an open mind. Sip a glass of wine and...relax."
2,Not Naked Anymore,"I thought Aya was a Rescue Action, then this (although not Jay Denes) is going back to Acid / Trancy stuff, e.g, ""Moonsglow"", bleh!I want my Naked ""feel"" back, please come back.I will wait till the most naked song in this album comes in EP ""Give it back.""Too pop, too dry, not naked."
2,"Hmmmm, that's all I can say...","This was my first time listening to Gaelle and all I can say is ""Hmmmmm""....This CD was depressing to me, all the beats were down beat. This CD would be a great buy for someone who is always in a somber mood and never has an optimistic outlook on life."
5,music lover,All I can say is WOW! This is a must have for music lovers. She is truly a gifted artist. The whole flow of this album was incredible. I cant wait for her next cd!
1,What a waste,"I have read most of Kathy Reich's series about Tempe Brennan, so when I had a chance bought seasons 1/2 to watch. It is horrible. The tv series is not even close to the book series. Main character should have had a different name. I don't know if I want to read the books anymore.It doesn't help that Brennan is portrayed as a young woman with no social characteristics. She is totally ignorant about everything, and is allegedly too brilliant to care. So she hires an intern who is very similar.So why did they get rid of him in season 3?The series should be called Leuton Lab in deference to the old Peyton Place my grandmother used to watch. Bed hopping, sexual innuendos or blatant comments. TV has really deteriorated. Folks think trash like this is fit to watch? Dream on. This is a product of the X or Y or whatever generation follows the Baby Boomers. Pathetic."
2,TOO EXPENSIVE!,You can purchase the 1st and 2nd season together at walmart for a little over $20. My wife pointed that out after i overpaid here!
4,"Good Show, Good Acting.","While not as great as many of the shows out there, this show is interesting and has a great cast. Temperance Brennan is an unusual character for a leading lady in a drama, which is partly the shows appeal. Not as good as CSI, but definitely a quality crime drama."
2,halp,"Most likely a wonderful show (I haven't gotten around to watching it) that I got as a gift for my dad for Christmas. Unfortunately, when we opened it, it was missing the first disc. Haven't yet followed up on it, but hopefully we'll be able to enjoy it as much as we would have - with the first five or ten episodes."
5,BONES IS AWESOME,"Very happy with this DVD set. Having double sided DVD's is convenient, even thought there is only one episode on a few of them."
2,"Great Show, totally ruined!!",This is an excellent TV series with great characters and presented with flair and polish.So why would I rate it as being worth only two stars? Bad editing! At the end of each episode one is left with huge holes in the story.This series on DVD is the victim of a merciless editing department.Fire the editor. Teach him a lesson!!
4,A good surprise.,"This is a solid ""let's find out who is the killer"" show, above most of the crime-solving shows around nowaday.To see Boreanaz acting so well after playing Angel year after year is also gratifying.The episodes are good. Although (of course) the name of the show is ""BONES"" (Emily Deschanel's character), I think the supporting cast of Zak, Angelam, Jack and Dr. Brennan should have more screen time and plots written around them.The season ended with a good hook for Season 2."
5,BONES: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON,"THIS IS A GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND, BONES IS ONE OF HIS FAVORITES AND I AM SURE HE WILL ENJOY BEING ABLE TO WATCH ALL THE EPISODES IN ORDER."
2,"Great Show, Poor Packaging","This is actually my second copy of Season One, as my first copy got scratched beyond repair.I was very disappointed to see that it is still packaged very cheaply, with episodes on both sides of the disc. With no ""safe"" place to put my fingers, or set it down for a moment, it is impossible to avoid scratching.I would happily pay a few dollars more for a re-packaged version, in the style of seasons two to five, if it were to become available. If it ISN'T re-packaged, when this set inevitably gets scratched, that's it. I'm not buying it again with episodes on both sides."
3,Would have been the perfect set...,"... if they'd all been single-sided disks like subsequent season sets. I have a 400 disk DVD changer that I swap out my series disks on a couple of times a year. When I went to add ""Bones"" season 1, I was dismayed to find that the disks are ""flippers"" with content on both sides of the disk. The seasons Two and Three that I also own are all single-sided disks with silk-screened art.Flipper disks are useless to me, unless I can talk my child into flipping them for me. I also prefer silk-screened disks, as they are easier to read the info on than the tiny inner-ring labels on two-sided disks.The show itself is stellar, but as a disk set, it needs better presentation."
3,Rotten Packaging,"Just finished going through the series. The ""Bones"" series rates 5 stars, great entertainment. The idiots that packaged the series are greedy (choosing the cheapest way to market the series), they get 1 star (thus we have the average of 3 stars). Double sided CDs=very difficult to quickly find the disk with the episode you want to watch and (heaven forbid) the disks get taken out of the case and left out...what a waste of time to put them back in order. It is my hope that the second season is packaged better, otherwise I am very doubtful whether I would buy into any further seasons unless the price reflected the packaging."
4,Why DOUBLE THE PRICE on this Great Show?,"I love this show and was adding it to my Christmas list only to find that the price had MORE THAN DOUBLED in the past few weeks ~ from $19.99 to $42.49!!! (This wasn't a price available from outside vendors, it was from Amazon itself ""with free Super Saver Shipping"".) I thought Amazon was supposed to provide Good Deals!?! The show gets 5-stars, but Amazon's pricing deserves 0- or 1-star(s)."
5,Keep rollin' BONES!!!,"The book series got me interested in watching the TV show. Even though it is different, I am so glad I decided to watch!I rented the first season, and now I'm officially addicted! I definitely want to own this series. I absolutely love and can't get enough of it! It just sucked me in - the science, the murders, the mysteries, the chemistry between Boreanaz and Deschanel. It's all so good!!! I'm in the middle of season two now, and it just keeps getting better with every episode!! I hope this show stays on the air for many more seasons!"
5,"Great show, but ...","I love the show. The characters drive the show more than the rather realistic effects. My only complaint about this DVD collection is the way the discs themselves are put together. The episodes are on the front and back of the discs, and the writing on the discs are so small it is hard for me to tell side a from b. The packaging does not tell you where the break between the sides are.I am happy to say that this was corrected on the second season, which was also excellent.Bones - The Complete Second Season"
2,"Bad writing, bad acting","The plots are sort of interesting as is the forensic investigative techniques, but I cannot get past the horrendous writing and terrible acting. This show has the potential to be good, but honestly, the acting is atrocious. The characters are not well developed (very simplistic) there is too much talking about completely irrelevant stuff. Don't buy."
1,Won't play on a SONY DVD player?,"I have never seen BONES but have heard really good things about it. I purchased Season 1 and finally settled in last night to begin watching the series. I put in the first disc (did notice the ""two-sided"" feature; not a fan) and waited and waited...and waited for it to load. I at last got a message: ""can't play on this DVD player."" Since my player is a SONY and has played everything I've ever put to it (CDs, homemade DVDs, commercial DVDs, other two-sided DVDs, etc) I was stunned. I realize this is a review forum, but I would really like to hear from someone who can explain what's happening. BTW, this set was purchased new from a reputable source. Anything I can do or am I stuck? I'm beyond my return time for the product."
1,bones season 1,i was very disappointed when i recived my dvd in the mail 1 out of 4 disc's were missing the rest were wrote on with sharpie
1,A completely unlikable character,"I had heard good thing about the show and I got season one as a gift. Talk about a let down. Brennan is a completely unlikable character. She's clueless to social etiquette and popular culture, and worst of all, completely dismissive of others' belief systems. That lack of respect really turned me off to the show. How Brennan wrote a best selling murder mystery is beyond me. She doesn't understand how human emotions work so how could have the characters in her book been readable? Hodges is a left-wing conspiracy nut job who spouts the same old tired nonsense. They could have had fun with this character, but wrote a cliche. How this show stayed on the air so long is beyond me. I'm glad I didn't pay for it."
1,never received,This item was lost in transit so I never received it. The customer service reps quickly refunded the purchase price to my credit card.
2,Cliche yawner,"I've watched this show several times, but I can't see it's appeal. Maybe just the fact that David Boreanaz is in yet another show attracts people (especially women I imagine). I find the characters irritating and cliche. I don't think Emily Deschanel is that great of an actress. If you want a good crime show that has intriguing characters and great interaction/ stories watch NCIS."
5,OUTSTANDING PURCHASE,WE LOVE BONES AND WATCH IT WHEN WE GET BORED WITH WHAT IS ON TELEVISION. WE WILL BE ADDING TO OUR BONES LIBRARY AND HOPE THAT THE MERCHANT THAT WE PURCHASED FROM HAS OTHER SEASONS AVAILABLE WHEN WE ARE READY TO PURCHASE.
2,Bones-Season One - THE MISSING EPISODES (8),"I am glad for the opportunity to discuss Bones - Season One. Reason being, there are eight episodes missing from this season. Starting with Disc One, the last two episodes on all the discs in this season are missing! Boy in a Bush, The Man in the Wall, The Woman in the Car, The Superhero in the Alley, The Skull in the Desert, The Man with the Bone, The Soldier in the Grave & The Woman in Limbo. All these are missing!!I feel cheated in a big way. This is the case with all Season One! So, if you buy Season One you getting 8 episodes less than you paid for. I like to refer to it as ""RIPPED OFF"" So Bones -The Complete First Season -ISN'T"
2,bones season 1,The first copy that i received was defective. Two of the four disk's were damaged. Amazon exchanged it for a new copy. I received the new copy in about 2 days. Good service. Bones is my new favorite show. I hope Fox don't mess it up.
1,Bones - Season One,I love this show! The actors are wonderful and the writing is fabulous. I hope this show goes for a long time. I'm entertained and feel smarter when an episode ends! How great is that?!
5,Great show!,"Love this show! It is smart, funny, suspenseful and so much more! Thanks for sending me a great quality DVD set!"
4,fast service.,The product arrived quickly and was in superb condition as well. It was a gift for my aunt and has not been played yet but everything was in pristine condition and I am very happy with my purchase.
5,Best show on TV,I love this TV series. I think Bones has much cleaner humor than what is out there these days. It also has a good story line for all the characters and you find out more and more about each person from episode to episode. It can definitely become addictive. I think if you like investigative shows that are more light hearted and funny then Bones is an awesome pick.
4,Interesting First Season,I bought this DVD set sight unseen when it was on special at Amazon.com. I had done the same with House and that purchase was an all out winner. I am not a fan of commercials so I don't watch any network show. Watching Bones was a bit of a disappointment but not too bad of one. It is not as good a show as House is but does have interesting well made episodes. I will watch the second season and see how the show goes on from there. I enjoy the mystery and the cases but am put off by the business-like atmosphere of the show and what I see as its impersonal-ness. I guess I'm not used to network shows to see what the others look like but the show still feels very businesslike to me. Still I am more than willing to stick around for season 2.
2,Very Bad !!,"As a life-long Elvis fan all I can say is don't waste your money.In this concert he really could care less about this performance,talking and laughing in the middle of most of the songs.I listened to this cd just one time,and its at the very bottom of the pile never to be listened to again.Not a very good way to preserve his music or memory !!!"
1,Same software available for free,"While I endorse the Sony LocationFree system, I was previously annoyed that additional LocationFree players required the purchase of this CD-ROM for about 30 bucks. However, as of November 29, 2007, the software contained on this CD-ROM is available as a free download from Sony's website. No code is required -- it is truly just free. My 1-star rating of the CD-ROM sold here is based entirely on ""value"", comparing it to the exact same version that is available as a free download."
3,A nothing-special story told in flat prose,"I read a Stephen King intro to a Matthew Scudder novel in which King said that Scudder and Stoner were his two favorite PI's. King should be ashamed of himself.The Lime Pit is a not particularly well told hard-boiled detective story. There are no surprises. There are no likable characters. The telling is very formulaic. The writing is at best mediocre. Robert Parker, Loren Estleman, Lawrence Block, Donald Westlake write interesting, lively, original characters. Jonathan Valin's Harry Stoner is dull, plodding and predictable.I may try another Harry Stoner novel some day, but only when I have run out of other things to read."
4,One of the best jazz recordings from anywhere in the world!,"The only female jazz pianist/composer/arranger who understands blending smoothness with rawness and delivers that with both vibrancy and subtlety. Listeners are completely hooked with the first count-off. You will not want to wriggle yourself free from the playful yet elegant offerings on this CD, led by Zadeh's awesome wide-range voice and grasp of dissonance.Keep making music, Ms. Zadeh! We hope to see you in North America on tour soon."
4,Good Product... Just not for Heavier people to use.,"We use scooters in our production plant, so we use scooters alot. They work really well as long as you are not over 250 lbs. The plastic rims just cant handle the weight."
3,Razor Wheels,"Good product and a good price. Not as thick as the ones that come with the scooter. There is more rim and less wheel. If you skid, it won't last too long."
3,Not quite the same as OEM,"My son who is 10 and about 70 pounds is probably getting too big for his razor. Because he uses the brake a lot and practices jumps, he wore out his previous wheels. This caused his scooter to rattle since the wheels were no longer round. These new wheels have a wider rubber part, which makes the ride softer, but also wear down faster. It wasn't 30 minutes of [hard] use until they were not round either. There is a different model of wheel with a wider piece of hard plastic inside the rubber. We ended up getting those and they wear better under our conditions."
2,Scooter wheels,I was not super impressed with these at all. After a week they started to get flat spots from braking and my son replaced them after about two weeks. If you are buying them for a young person under 9 it should be fine but my son is 13 and all into the stunts and they didn't hold up... although they looked cool. You get what you pay for.
5,Work Great,"My son was happy to be zipping along again on his razor scooter after his rear wheel feel apart after years of use. I tried several local bike shops, Walmart, Kmart etc... and nobody stocks these things. Found and ordered in 60 seconds on Amazon and got a great price as well. He liked the new green color and the smooth speed the new bearings provide."
2,Pictures don't match product,"The hubs are much larger than shown in the Pic; They LOOK great... however, The wheels are Skinned over the hub and the urethane is thin - they came apart easily. So much for a quality wheel_The bearings are ABEC 5 rated_Kryptonics have a more standard wheel that is built as shown."
2,Not as I expected,"Unlike the picture suggests, these wheels are actually the NEWER version of replacement wheels which have SMALLER rubber width making it very easy to wear off. Just look at the customer uploaded photos of the product and you will see for yourself that the seller false advertised this item. I am very upset that they sold me these wheels."
4,Replacement wheels improved my son's scooter,My son has been using his scooter a lot more since he replaced his razor scooter wheels. He had worn his other wheels down so much that he needed new ones. Now he is doing tricks and stunts on a homemade ramp in the garage.
1,Rubber is Too Soft,After only 30 minutes of riding the braking was causing the wheels to be unstable. Also the wheel was too big to fit into the front spot.
3,scooter wheels,the wheels look good and are probably strong for kids that dont ride scooters like me. i snapped mine in HALF on a huge jump doing a barspin. i would recommend them but not for a trick rider.
2,Not Pleased!,"My son picked these wheels because of the picture. I just received the wheels and what the picture shows is not what I was sent. The wheels I got the center area is not the same. The center of the wheels I received is larger and not as many spokes (not sure if that is the right word for the center area, but hopefully you get my drift) The actual rubber part of the wheel is smaller. I'll keep the wheels I received but be aware that what is pictured is not what you will get."
4,Can Withstand Skatepark Abuse,"First off let me just say the bearings are ABEC-5The stock wheels on my scooter got destroyed after two visits to the skate park.These have lasted 4 visits so far and look like they could handle about 10 more, the wear is very minimal.I took off a star because they are only ABEC-5's and they could have come in more colors."
1,really bad,these are really soft and ride nice until you use the brake because they get flat spots in them. this happened to me the 2nd day i had them. dont waste your money!
4,"They worked great, but different","They're round. They're wheels. The 'wheel' part is larger than pictured, so the 'tire' isn't as deep. It probably won't matter if they become flat spotted from looking up the rear brake like the original ones did.They did go on just fine and the overall diameter and thickness are correct."
3,"Saint Saga #1.66, #03, #04, #08","Five complete Saint novels, unabridged? Not if the list of contents on the cover is accurate.The Saint Closes the Case(original titleThe Last Hero) andThe Avenging Saint(Knight Templar) are certainly complete novels, and what's more, two of the best. But ""The Man Who Was Clever"" and ""The Lawless Lady"" are merely two of the three stories inEnter the Saint, the other being ""The Policeman with Wings"".The Saint vs. Scotland Yard(original titleThe Holy Terror) is not a novel at all, but three more ""novellas"" of the same kind.So this looks to me not like 5 complete Saint books, but 3.66.I do like the picture on the cover, though.If pushed to it, I would say that the best single-volume anthology of Saint stories isThe First Saint Omnibus.P.S. For a list of — and discussion of — all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To... Guide."
5,Circus of the Darned,"This was the final book in this series by Katie Maxwell. To read the continuation of this story... switch to Katie MacAlister, ""In the Company of Vampires"". The novel is a quick easy read, entertaining... one you can't put down. You'll love it, if you like vampires! Book was in excellent condition and shipping was fast. Thanks!"
2,Joe Cocker on Tour 1981,"This cd is bad.This live cd includes only elleven tracks recorded live in New York 1981.If you looking for a concert of Joe Cocker in this periode, buy the dubble album ""Standing Here"" (2001), instead.Joe Cocker did a comeback in 1981 and released the album ""Sheffield Steel"" the following year."
3,Good Story,"I had forgotten how ""wordy"" and detailed these old books were. I am remembering that we had few distractions and we read longer periods at a time.Keyes is known for her character development and her love for the southern people and their lifestyle. I am a product of the south so I identified with situations, attitudes and ""characters"".It was really too long for today's standards; don't suppose any ""moderns"" would like to read it."
2,Didn't like it!,"Too long and too boring. Character development was absent. In fact, you read about a person, get to know them and they do something so out of character that it's like reading a new book. There were many horrific people in this story but when the ""good"" people become bad, you wonder why you are reading such an unhappy novel."
1,nice system too bad it doesn't work,"after only about 2 weeks the monitor went. i called the company and waited to hear from them. on feb 19th i got an email asking the model number for the monitor , so right away i sent them the model. then i waited for a responce. after 2 weeks i call them and they told me that it was a discontinued item and they could do nothing for me. i am now waiting for an investigaton thru amazon"
3,"pretty, but thick","i really like these... but the post is pretty thick, and u need to use some force to get the earring backs on. other than that, i love them!"
5,"""Is Being Remembered a Kind of Antidote to Death?""","I don't usually run up and get a book autographed by the author. But person at the luncheon was mesmerizing. I sat there and thought about her mother Ingrid Bergman, her trials and tribulations, her remarkable beauty, her astonishing talent, and her warmth and genuineness. It was a wonderful and heartwarming 2 hours. I think everyone felt they had met a friend. The book? It covers the waterfront, written in crisp, clear, engaging style. Honest, memorable, including her unforgettable encounters with Anna Magnani, Katharine Hepburn, Martin Scorsese (ex-husband), Gary Oldman. Film, modeling, Television, businesswoman, human being. ""Is being remembered a kind of antidote to death? Is fame a sor of eternity? A remedy to the sadness of the end? Does having a famous mother, whoisstill seen every day on TV smiling, crying, walking, talkin, maker her death different, less definitive than other deaths?"" This book will last!"
2,Good ideas but poorly written,"The author knows how to tell a story. I thought the plot and the characters were very interesting, but I did have trouble reading the book because of the overwhelming amount of grammatical errors. Misspelled words, incorrect verb usage, missing spaces and missing commas were some of the MANY annoying errors in this book. The author even had the nerve to ""write"" in a letter next to a typed word. That was absolutely ridiculous!I actually read the author's first book, The Manhunt, and that book had numerous errors as well. I was assuming the author would learn from her mistakes and perhaps hire an editor for her second novel, but it seems as though the errors are even more numerous in this novel than they were with the first!Major suggestion for the author - HIRE AN EDITOR!"
5,Interesting..,"First, let me say this.. This book was so good. I started it at around 5 in the afternoon and it was done at 1:30 in the morning. While reading this I think we all in one time had some Voodoo love.. This book kept me on my toes because you never knew what was going to happen next. I tried to put it down but I couldn't. Darika was stark crazy.. but I felt really bad for her. I think every women has been in her situation one time in her life. I am a darkskinned sister and was teased but I never let it get to me. I feel and know that I am very attractive and have no problem with my self esteem. Unfortunatly, there are women who have this complex. But as far as this book, I'm glad I picked it up. It gave me insight, understanding and a good laugh."
4,Voodoo tends to be the root of most problems...,"This book was GREAT! In reading it, it actually made me think about how selfish and evil women can be and that should be a warning to all the selfish men out there fooling around on their women! I loved everything about this book! Can wait to read more from Sonia."
3,Good read but toooooooooo many grammar errors,If you are looking for a novel full of drama this one is for you. The drama will keep you turning the pages but the grammar errors will make you want to trash the novel. If you can deal with the grammar errors you are in for a good read with many twists and turns.What was wrong with Darika? Her self esteem was very low. I see why she was taking Prozac. Keith was way out of line. He should have been ashamed of his actions. He shouldn't have married Darika if he didn't love her. Because he felt sorry for her was a poor excuse.Beverly made me sick. She married her husband for her own selfish reasons. How could she call herself someone's friend with the devil actions she was doing.I could go on and on about this novel. I will close by saying I wish the author the best but please get an editor when and if you choose to write another novel. Your ratings will increase and your readers will thank you. Be Blessed!
3,Good story bad editing,"This book has a great story line and is very realistic to read. Sonia is a great writer, so far as I have seen, capturing the realism of and African-American woman's life. Unfortunately I am sad to se that one of my sisters has such a terrible editing staff, if one at all. SistahGirl Book Publishers should have known better than to have published a book with countless numbers of grammatical errors. If nothing else a good friend is always a good proof reader. All-in-all it was a good read"
1,What's voodoo got to do with it?,"Darika was a fool from the beginning,before she even thought about going to see the voodoo woman. As for all the other women they were just as foolish, falling all over Keith. The author could have used some of her own advise from the book and taken some English courses. The grammar was horrible. I was insulted that this book was put on sale and was considered okay to buy.Just sell us anything.I had to read this book because it was chosen as a book club selection.I borrowed it from someone,I'm glad I didn't shell out any money for it.In reading some of the other reviews other people agree with me. I hope is this author writes another book, her grammar and puncuation have improved.Also, has anyone let her know about her writing?"
3,TWO WORDS - NEW EDITOR!!,"I enjoyed the book, but I would have enjoyed it a thousand times more if the editor would have done a better job!! Please get a new editor.... The errors really take away from the story and you have the skills to be on top."
4,Great Book!,"This book was an especially good one in the series. JD Robb is a wonderful writer and I enjoy the characters in her ""In Death"" series."
2,(not) quite enough,"...or maybe too much. Started with the 1st ""...in Death"" book...a while ago. We know Eve's a B.A. cop, it's her job, more than her job, her hair's a ""mess""... Now that we know...restating the point is b-o-r-i-n-g. Eve's pals are great to know and hear about, the story...OK, her relationship w/R...solid. So..unless there's some kind of word/pages requirement...move on."
5,best yet!,"Nora Roberts almost forgot about being a ROMANCE author and actually wrote a great mystery. Now I have read all the JD Robb books and I like them all. But I was so glad the sex, sex, sex and did I say sex-oh yeah-it got toned way down. Finally. A good mystery need not have so many sex scenes as her previous books. It was well written, a great bad guy and a really great twist. Things are getting a bit redundant it's time to mix things up a bit. I personally think this series would make a great TV show. I am totally involved with all the major characters and would love to see them all in 3d, especially Mcnab! And of course Roarke. I may have to buy the next book in hardcover!"
3,Nice Read - a little mellow,"I've read all the ""in Death"" books and I've enjoyed all to varying degrees. The one thing I noticed about this book that's different from the others, is the characters all seem to be mellower, gentler, less edgy.I'm not sure if this is deliberate on Ms Roberts' part, or if the writing is off. There were passionate moments between Eve & Roarke, but they read more like a manual or observation. Eve seemed to spend the whole book questioning her relationships, and she seemed softer. Again, I don't know if this is deliberate, or Ms Roberts has gotten the characters confused alittle (she does write LOTS of books).Overall, I enjoyed the book, though it's not one of her better efforts. Although, a average effort from Ms Roberts, is still very readable and enjoyable.I'm still addicted to this series, and am waiting for the next instalement. Happy reading. :o)"
3,Disappointed again!,"I am disappointed with this ""in Death"" book. I was looking forward to the continuing story of Eve, Roarke, and their friends. The book added no movement in the storyline. I don't know what is happening, but the past few books haven't been as good. I wish that Ms. Roberts could move the storyline. I really liked ""Portrait in Death"" because many key revelations were made. I hope she looks to Conspiracy, Vengenance, and Naked in Death for inspiration. I'll continue to read the ""in Death"" books, but I want to find out more about Eve and Roarke's past."
2,just okay,"I keep buying these books hoping that Nora will give us more, I am about to give up. Give us something more Nora we can handle it!!! We know all the characters now give us some meat."
3,So So with a twist,"Having only read a few of this series, I was interested to delve further. The book was somewhat predictable until the end - don't want to give a spoiler."
3,Editor please!,"Though I have since discovered that there are a considerable number of books preceding it in the series, this is the first book about future cop Eve Dallas and her dedication to the job that I have read. I am a great fan of mysteries and not a strict grammarian. The characters in this book are interesting and the plot gripping, so it was disappointing to have poor writing constantly intruding on the story line. I can accept that in 2060 the difference between ""lay"" ""lie"" and ""laid"" might be completely lost, but not that the word ""like"" would appear in every sentence on one page, or that words and grammar could be constantly misused. This book is already good but would be so much better if it had been thoroughly reviewed by a really competent editor. Then we would have been spared sentences like ""The seductive smell (of coffee) crept into her brain like a lover climbing a flower-strewn trellis."" As Eve Dallas would say - ""Jeez!""She deserves better."
4,More in a great series,"I love the ""in death "" series. Stumbled upon them by accident and now i am addicted! I have read all of them on my kindle but this was not available to Australian kindle customers. So I sent for the hard copy. No disappointment...another excellent read. I am amazed how involved with the characters I have become..and am so glad I did not miss this one where Peabody is badly injured...with the consequent poignant writing by J.D. Robb in relation to the other familiar characters in the series as they react to her crisis. Escape at its best...but these books also have a depth in human psychology which I find incredibly appealing."
2,Disappointed Again,"Once again, I spared no expense by running out on the first day to purchase the new J.D.Robb thriller. With much excitment and anticipation, I sat down in my favorite chair ready to read this new story. Within three pages, I was looking to see if I had maybe bought the wrong book. I could have sworn that I had read these pages before. The interaction between Roarke and Eve was lacking in all areas and Eve seems to have gotten a shot of ""Glenda the Good Witch."" Where is the tough-talking, hard a** detective we know and love? One can only hope that this is an insidious plot by Ms. Roberts that we are unaware of and soon our favorite characters will once again return. This was strike number two, and if the next book is no better I will no longer be reading this series. Concentration is key to a good story and this story was definately lacking:("
3,Mediocre,"While this book was certainly much better than the title before, it lacks most of what has made this series so remarkable. Gone was much of the interaction between Roarke and Eve and if this had been my first exposure to this series, I would have never guessed the depth of the emotions between the characters. I will continue reading the series as I am hooked on the love story between Roarke and Eve but I sincerely hope that Ms. Roberts gets back to what sets these books apart from any of her others."
2,Not her best,"While all the previous ""Death"" books were excellent with good plot development, witty dialog, and excellent characterization, Ms. Roberts appears to have gotten tired of the series. This book was simply phoned in. The plot line of a serial killer has been done much better. The addition of a psychic did not benefit the story. There was no further development among the relationships of the characters. I can only hope that the next book indicates that Ms. Roberts has rejuveniated her ideas for the series."
3,Left a Lot to be Desired,"Another murder case for Eve Dallas and the cast of characters Roberts has created for her ""in death"" books. Although the plot was set up pretty good - following a serial rapist/mutilator, I didn't really `feel' this book. The characters didn't draw me in, and the case took way too long to solve. Added to that, the police psychic that is employed (Celia) didn't have a major role in the book although her character was given a lot of depth and could have been more central to the plot. The end does have a twist, but the twist came too late in my opinion and seemed like an attempt to `tack something extra' onto the plot. Is the character of Eve always so harsh? I didn't like her very much, certainly didn't feel her childhood pain as it related to the storyline, and wondered at how she could be paired with someone like Roarke. The book was ok, but I wouldn't recommend it nor read any more in the series."
3,Disappointed In Death,"I have read every single 'In Death' book, and I have to say this is my least favorite of them all. There was hardly any focus on the main characters that we have come to know and love, and a killer that came out of nowwhere. I always look forward to the next episode in Eve & Roarke's life, and I hope the next one is better."
3,"Well, Really three and a half stars....","This is book number 20 in the series, and I have read them all to date. The book is an 'ok' addition to the series; something about it just lacked the zing that the other books seemed to have.I am one of those readers that finds Eve's past abuse somewhat tiring. Roberts finds a way to tie it into every single case Eve works on. And I know a few cops, and I know that occasionally they will use civilian 'experts', but somehow Eve gets her husband in on EVERY single one of her cases. Plausibility aside, the storyline was good, my big beef with the book is it just wrapped it up too darn quick. One chapter they are struggling for answers, the next chapter they suddenly got the guy? Roberts could easily have added another 50 or even 100 pages and worked through the story a bit better, and not lost any of reader's interest.I will continue to read the ""In Death"" books and I look forward to hopefully seeing Eve grow a bit more, or continue to grow I should say."
5,visions in death,"I will read any book she write,I think she is the best.I love Eve and Roarke .There are great together."
4,just as good,"the book i purchased was just as good as the the following books i have read in which the main character is the lead, this being an older book i am glad the the following books got better and better."
4,Good Sun Burn Book,"Great book to read on the beach... I found it impossible to put down, and ended up burnt.I am a bit of a fan of Kinky, I think his books make a change, they are easy to read, the humor is very dry and the escapades of Kinky himself are just hilarious. It was easy to drift away with this book, the language was simple, it took very little effort to reach the end and the pace of the book kept me interested. I wouldn't go as far to call Kinky a literary genius, but he knows how to churn out a fun story and a few laughs. After a hard days work in the swamp, what could be better?"
4,Very informative and introductory,"It was a very good quality book, very informative. It is NOT a full informative planing trip gide, but rather a good place to start planing your own trips."
3,"Pretty Pictures, Lacking In Meet","Flyfishing books seem to come in 3 forms, unfortunately.1) How To - From Basic to Obscure tips2) Stories/Biography's - Self Explanatory3) Pretty PicturesWhile there are exceptions (""Leaper"", ""Atlantic Salmon Chronicles"" come to mind), this isn't one. It's in the Pretty Pictures category. And Pretty the Pictures Are! It shows you the same places the magazine always talk about, but in glorious color. Good for the coffee table I suppose."
4,Nice Book,I received this book for Christmas and have enjoyed thumbing through the pages. It could really use some more pictures to accompany the destinations they recommend. It is important to note that these fifty destinations are the opinions of other fly fishermen. The small size makes it a great book to have on the coffee table without taking up too much room.
3,Beatiful places,"nice book, but i would like to see more pictures of the different species!! also some maps to locate some places would be great...I live in argentina and the 3 places chosen are great, although you must be a millionaire to fish rio grande!! Fortunately we still have a lot of places here to fish for free.I would rather see a book where they tell where to fish and spent little money (as an example the book tells you that i f you want to fish rio traful, the only way to do it is going to arroyo verde lodge and thats no true!! you can do it for free if you want..there are accesses by foot or you can reach it by the lake, an there are other private places much more cheaper, but why they dont describe that??). Do not tell me where i can go spending $ 5000 a week because its obvious i could go everywhere with that money!!!!"
2,Places i only wish i could go,"There are a lot of places i realy wish i could go fly fishing. Unfortunatly, there are only a few select places that are affordable. and those that are doable just don't have much description convincing me to go. if there was only some background info or narrative this book would go be a much more useful guide."
5,Wish We Had This Sooner,"I ordered the DVD after Christmas and spent the remaining 1 week of vacation watching this every night. With a free trial of Amazon Prime, I got it in 4days. My soon to be 6yr old son who is in Kindergarten loves this! He adores the ""3 Little Pigs"" story and seeing it on video is such a delight for him. He is an emerging reader and this product has helped reinforce his skills. I never taught him how to read before he went to K. But, I now I'm wishing that I've gotten this product for him sooner. It's such an effective tool to teach children who are ""visual"", just like my son, to be interested in reading. Now planning to purchase the ""Read Along Stories"". Hope they would come up with a new series, with more stories to read in just one DVD."
3,not sure,"My kids LOVE all the Leapfrog DVDs about reading, letters, numbers, but they were not interested in this so far. So we have had this for a few weeks but we have not watched it at this point. :("
2,5 year old,"Unfortunately, my five year old was bored with this dvd. It doesn't seem to have anything within the alphabet phonics to engage younger children. The dvd displays a persons mouth and a visual alphabet letter, while repeating the phonic sounds of every single letter."
4,Killer deal!,"This is such an awesome, fun, and cheap little dvd! I got the newer version of this dvd from the same company, and I like the newer version better (which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars)....but you can't beat the price on this one! I recommend getting both."
5,This is one of those unsung Christmas movies,"This is a very good movie with a great cast. Ginger Rogers portrays a woman on furlow from prison who meets Joseph Cotton, a soldier suffering from combat fatigue (We now call it post traumatic stress disorder). The setting is WWII era Arizona at Christmas. You get a bonus because you see Shirley Temple as a yound adult actress.This movie, like The Bishop's Wife, is a good Christmas movie that most people overlook."
3,OK movie,"This was a OK movie but not one that I would watch more than once. I felt it was a little dry, and not as moving as I thought it would be."
1,Never got it!,"I would love to give this a good review, but I have been waiting almost a year for it! Seems Amazon doesn't know that it was never available for shipping!"
3,Another Foo Foo book,"I took this on a business trip to Atlanta. It kept me preoccupied on a bumpy flight. Story was familiar. I have been associated with abused wives in my profession and sort of bought into the book. Once you get past that, the interaction between Merry, Heath and adorable Sammy was amusing. Goliath is a wonder dog and I want to buy him!!!I think this is enuf of these kinds of books for a while. I am supposed to stay away from too much sugar."
3,Oh please!,"I suppose I just couldn't get past the ""sweetkens"" endearment and the constant mistrust of Heath even though he did nothing but help Meredith. Her account of how Dan treated her... spiders and guns during intimacy was too much for me to believe. I did like Sammy and Goliath. I do love dogs. Just my opinion."
5,It Touched My Heart,Catherine Anderson has done it again. This time in a contemporary love story. The interplay between Meredith and Glenn develops slowly but the love between Sammy and Goliath is the strength of this family to be. I've read this book at least 3 times and love it more each time. A definite must for any Anderson fan!!!
4,"It does a decent job, and it is easy on batteries",I use it to cut my hair and beard too. Since I keep my hair ultra short this does an amazing job - very easy to use. I has a dial on it to set the desired hair length while cutting and you just have to run on your hair...that easy! I use Sony 900mAh rechargeable batteries and it just keeps going without frequent recharge. I would recommend this to anyone for its purpose.Beard trimmers might not be very happy with its near close shave.
2,Not For The Clumsy,Only good for those that can figure out exactly how much hair will come off with the settings of the two trimmers. WHEN you make a mistake do not try to correct it. Time will correct everything and a steadier hand.
4,4 Movie Marathon: James Stewart Western Collection,"Four Jimmy Stewart western genre films, a fine collection of family fare; have the popcorn and soda pop ready for a grand festival of entertainment. Each movie can easily stand on its own, so here it can be said 'four adventures ofr the price of one'...good old fashioned western flicks - with Jimmy Stewart to boot.."
5,A must see for all James Steward western fans,I love old westerns and was very satisfied with this 4 movie marathon pack featuring James Stewart. The quality was very good and I'm very happy with this purchase.
2,Couldn't access 2nd movie on each disk,"My husband really likes Jimmy Stewart so got this as a gift, but have not been able to access the second move on each of the two disks."
4,Stewart fan,Great set for the price; I love them. I especially like Rare Breed which gives a look into the old west that few would understand if they had not lived in a pioneering period.
5,"Works Great, Low Maintenance","I've been running one of these filters on my 120 gallon freshwater tank for about the last four and a half years. It's performed flawlessly and it keeps the water very nice. Maintenance is easy and it can be performed in a few minutes without having to get inside of the tank or filter. I just use a bucket and pull out the pad and sponge from the filter and the two foam cylinders from the overflow boxes, wash them out in cool water and re-install.I'm using a 900 gallon an hour rated Rio pump with this setup. Getting it set up and going is quite easy and getting the siphon tubes running and the water level set where you want it to be in the tank is about the toughest part.My filter doesn't seem to be excessively noisy but it's also mounted inside of a closed cabinet under the tank so that probably helps quite a bit."
3,a fine compilation of Satriani songs.,"At $6.99 it's a fine intro to Satriani's music. Sadly there are only 10 songs at 42:30min long. I am sure Joe has made a lot more music to add to a compilation CD. Those who like this type of music, and guitar playing, will go on to buy more Satriani, and might as well go with G3, and Steve Vai for basically more of the same."
4,good picnic table cloth,"good quality, durable and easy to clean. there is a strong plastic smell when you open it up, but it goes away."
5,great for supplementing,"I mainly bf, but do supplement occassionally and these are perfect. It doesn't make sense to open a large bottle of formula if you're only giving 2-4 oz/day because there's no way you'd be able to use it all before they say to throw it away. I use the enfamil nipples that Amazon sells or I pour into a bottle."
5,Gives break to breastfeeding moms,My baby loves this product. We are giving him this since he was 2 days old at hospital. Now he is 3 months old and still loves this product. I give him when we are traveling or I m too tired to feed him. Very convenient to use.
4,It is Very good product.,"Hi,I bought first time the baby product from amazon, and it is delivered good and the experience with amazon is good."
2,10 bottles were broken,"I will never order this product again from Amazon. I mean, our daughter loves this formula, and it's very useful when you aren't home and need to feed your baby. Unfortunately during the shipment they broke at least 10 bottles, and I found a mess inside the box. I suppose they should use a special packaging for it."
5,Great product,"These bottles really are great. I breast feed but hate to pump, so these bottles are great for my husband to feed the baby while I run out to the grocery store, or take a nap! 2oz is enough to tide the baby over without messing up my supply. My baby is 5 months now and he's just starting to outgrow these bottles... he needs 3-4oz a feeding."
4,BEWARE NO NIPPLES,"Similac is terrific (I was a Similac baby myself), and I bought this pack as an emergency supply to have handy after learning about the option through my hodpital (which used these pre-filled bottles in the nursery). But -- lo and behold -- it doesn't come with nipples! And Similac doesn't even appear to market them. So if you buy this, you should also get ENFAMIL npples, which I found on Amazon (a ten-pack, I believe). So this is why I give it four instead of five stars. Anyway, the more economic option for using Similac is of course the powdered version."
3,Didn't work for my baby...,"For some reason, the formula in the 2 ounce, as well as the 8 ounce bottles of Similac Advance Ready to Feed, is not the same as the 32 ounce. Both the 2 ounce and the 8 ounce made my baby projectile vomit almost every time. Only the formula in the 32 ounce bottles, which is visibly lighter in color and smells much better than the formula in the other bottles, works for her. Perhaps the processing is different or the 32-ounce bottle in which it is stored keeps the formula fresher during shipping and prior to sale, but all I know is that after several purchases of the 2 and 8 ounce bottles from different sources with same bad results, I know now that I can only use the 32 ounce bottles of formula. Otherwise, Similac Advance Ready to Feed has been wonderful. My baby loves it and she has been healthy and staying at the top of her growth curve. Also, we tried the Early Shield but it gives her painful gas cramps. Regular Similac Advance has worked best for her."
4,Great for the diaper bag,"These little guys are, of course, a little pricey, but well worth it when out and about with an infant. I wish they had a 4oz size instead of having to jump to the 8oz."
4,Good product. Some problem with packaging,My LO and I like Similac. It's a good product and very convenient. The only problem I have with it is that some of packaging I ordered recently came with 7 bottles per box. Not sure why this could happen.
5,Great product,Awesome product for newborns - great for on the go or when you don't have time to make bottles from powdered formula. The shape of the pre-mix bottle is also good - fits nicely in your hand. My 6-week old baby boy will only feed nicely on Similac nipples that come with the pre-made bottles - so much so that I have bought larger bottles for powdered formula that fit those nipples!
5,A must have for newborns,This is the same formula that the hospital provided after our daughter was born. We did not nurse so we continued to use these for two weeks until they became too small for our daughter as she is up to 3 + ounces per feeding after two weeks. The only negative is that each box of 8 only comes with one nipple. She does have some re flux and gas however I can not say it is because of the formula make up.
4,Good!,"Item came on time. Good price!This is the box of 48 bottles, no nipples included. When i placed this order, I thought there are at least several of nipples came along to use with, but surprisingly it's not. Thus, I have to buy the nipples separately."
5,"Convenient, but pricey","CONVENIENT! Great for on-the-go. My newborn love this and so do I. However, these are pricey compared to the powdered formula. At $40, you get 96oz worth. With the powder formula (from Sams Club), at $27, you get 244oz. We're currently using both types for our newborn. She seems to favor the Ready-to-Go better than the powder."
4,Great for traveling,Great set to have during travel or outdoor. No need to worry about freezing or heating up the milk. Wish the nipple comes with fast or standard flow for older baby.
4,Owned since July 2004,"I have checked the accuracy of this unit with others and as far as weight goes it is very accurate, however the body fat percentage is questionable. I don't think the inaccuracy has as much to do with the unit being defective as the method of measurement being used. Even if you measure your body fat at the same time of day, when you are most hydrated, and 3 hours after eating or exercising (this is difficult enough to manage) but the electrode sensors only measure body fat from your lower body. More accurate measurements take your whole body into consideration. There are similar devices that you put your fingers on, and those have the same problems because they only measure upper body fat. According to a personal trainer, this product's measurement of body fat is about 5% off. So, don't take the measurements too literally."
2,Kinda frustrating!,"Ok, so at first, this scale seems great. Easy to program and use, and you can see your weight and body fat percentages. BUT - turn the scale off, and then step on it again. I guarantee you will see different numbers-sometimes off by 1 or even 2 pounds! And how can a person's body weight suddenly jump by 4 percent?! Move the scale to another side of the bathroom. (Yes, we all do this!) Totally different reading than the previous two. I'm giving it two stars because it's always within 2 pounds or so, but boy, is it frustrating!"
4,The first scale I've ever been happy with!!,"I've had several scales over the years and was disappointed with all of them. Nearly a year ago, I started eating healthy and exercising regularly and, as a result, have lost about 30 pounds. I had been using the scale at the gym to weigh myself but it never seemed to be very reliable, despite the fact that it was a ""doctor-type"" scale (the gym never has it calibrated).I started researching scales and heard about this one, so I gave it a try. I LOVE it! It is SO easy to set up the first time and also easy to use. Two people can set up their stats and use separate buttons to weigh in and track their progress in weight and body fat. You use your toe to quickly and easily turn on the appropriate button (you can also hit a ""weight only"" button just to weigh yourself without the bodyfat part).The display is very easy to see and I love the digital readout!"
3,Scale regularity,"who knows if a bathroom scale is consistent and reads properly. this one seems to; we have returned others that gave very different reads on consecutive days. so far, there seem to be actual numbers and reproduceable numbers.the readings of body fat and fluid levels in the body are not changing. I don't know how necessary they are."
1,Bad experience with this purchase,"I bought one BF682 and two BF792 for holiday gifts while they have promotion on Tanita. Unfortunately, I received all three scales were opened box.The BF682 is work properly but the bottom on top is not that smooth when pressed, so I requested for exchange. The exchanged one is opened box either and it has the same problem as the first one.Two BF792 have problems with the fat %. I've tried 15 times on the first one, only 3 times showed the fat %, they are 8%, 18% & 23%. I've tired 10 times on the second one, none of them showed the fat %. Of course, I requested for exchange. The exchanged scales are also opened box. They work fine although the bottom is not smooth.Since I have no time to buy another gifts, therefore, I keep all three opened box scales. I was extremely angry and disappointed with this purchase. Amazon, do you have quality control on all stuffs that you sale? From this bad experience, I am scare to buy electronic from Amazon again."
5,So worth the money!,"I have to say, I love this scale. I wish I had bought it 7 weeks ago when I began my diet so I would know how much body fat I've lost.This scale is very easy to operate and read. I like the accuracy to .2 pounds (instead of .5 or 1.0 you see in other digital scales), but most of all, I love the fact that I can step on it 10 times in a row and get the same reading. That alone makes it worth buying."
4,Powerful performances,"The productions of the American Film Theatre have long been unavailable for viewing, either commerically or via broadcast. This filmed production of Jean Genet's 'The Maids' is arguably one of the best of the series. Glenda Jackson and Susannah York play sisters Solange and Claire, two maids, who take turns dressing up as their mistress (played by Vivien Merchant) and abusing each other in a parody of the master/slave relationship. Since the source material is a stage play, the plot is dialog driven, and in lesser hands this would have been excruciatingly dull. But Ms. Jackson and Ms. York (and Ms. Merchant) give full-throttle performances, and Christopher Miles' skillful direction never lets the tension lag for a moment as the secrets of the sisters are revealed one by one. If you require an editing cut every four or five seconds, this is not the movie for you. If you want to see three great actresses taking it to the limit, buy this film."
3,anti-frog,so my girl's afraid of water gettin in her eyes while she showers right so i give it to her and she gets soooooo wetman i wiped that down and i thought hardcoated stuff would be durablebut the next day i was in frogtown doin some TLC analysis and it didnt anti-frog at all
2,Crappy Lenses,"These goggles are comfortable for goggles, but not very useful for many things outside of shop class. My school sold these for chemistry class, which made no sense since the soft plastic lense is easily dissolved by solvents. They also scratch easily, and are clearly labeled as not for paintball or airsoft use. All this lends me to wonder what these are even made for aside from a little wood shop work?The lenses are replaceable, but at 5$ each /w s/h, whats the point of getting more of these crappy lenses?"
2,stealth safety googles,decided to follow through with the purchase after reading the reviews. after 15 mins of airsoft i found the googles to be impossible to play with. the fog was horrible.
5,Great product!,This product is sturdy and the magnatized tray works great!! My husband loves it and we will order more for the shop! I also ordered some for my crafts.
5,Comes in handy!!,Good looking and works well. Strong magnet to hold all sorts of fasteners and even holds the bowl to something magnetic without scratching it. Highly recommend!
5,Excellent Parts Tray,"Super strong magnet !!! Only problem, it will suck tiny screws right out of your hand and it magnetizes every ferrous item placed in it, HAHA I love it."
5,Quality at a Great Price,Very well constructed / finished - with a strong magnet base.It was a great deal for the money I paid - $4.00 with Free Shipping - you can't go wrong with that.
4,Great Drivin Tunes,"We play this on our return drives home after a long hike, keeps us rockin! Turn it up loud! Shakes the mirrors on the truck."
1,Stereotypical history??????,"This book is so full of the authors bias that it is difficult to pick out any useful information. I was left throughout thinking that there were crucial facts missing and that the author picked and chose only those nuggets that would fit the thesis. Could have been an outstanding study, instead it just highlights the stereotypical view of the ""evil"" German."
1,Absolute trash.,"This is another piece of lowbrow anti-German propaganda dressed as historiography.The book is a mess of primary, yet selective and biased historical research, simplistic psycho-babble, ridiculous sociological-anthropological speculation, pathetic organization behavioural theorising and last but not least, absolutely third rate military history. The author is hell bent on proving that there is a German Sonderweg from the founding of the Second Reich to Hitler, that the vaunted German Army is nothing but foolish automatons predisposed to atrocities and mindless offensives.All in all, cheap trash billed as history."
3,Not too terrible.,"I thought these would be irritating, but I ended up forgetting they were attached to my ears. As long as there's no pulling of the cords they stay in place with no problems whatsoever. The sound quality is nice enough to let you focus on what you're listening to (I had audiobooks and music) while still being aware of sounds beyond the earphones. Some people might find that irritating, I'm sure, but it's very useful when you need to be yanked out of a musical reverie while travelling or driving. People with hearing aids and glasses might have trouble wearing these if they have small ears or big earpieces. Nobody else in my house could even figure out how to put them on."
4,Panasonic clip on earphones,"I have found this inexpensive type of earphones to be superior to earbuds. One part goes over each ear (like eye glasses)- & the heads are hinged to swing into place. The comfort level is surprising. Unlike ear buds,they tend to stay in place.Performance is also superior to earbuds. The jack is pretty standard, fitting most audio devices, such as Walkman; iPod; my stereo. etc."
3,Great sound & control for $,"Good sound & control due to volume control on system; however without fail the foam headphone protection comes off within 2 to 3 weeks of purchase. If you are careful not to lose them though; they can be re-attached with the very tiny amount of nail glue in the side ridge when you restretch the foam over the headphone. If it didn't keep coming off, it would rate a 5 for sure for the price!"
3,wonderful,I liked it but wasn't happy with the alcohol content but it smells geat and isn't too oily so I can use it during the day
4,Fast Delivery,"I did not use the product yet, actually it is not for mebut i will update later if anything. But the delivery was fast!very fast delivery and right product!"
5,Moving Pictures,Moving Pictures Days of Innocence is one of those rare albums that has hits on every track. I have been hoping to stumble across this CD for at least ten years and on my first attempt to shop through the Internet; there it was. This will make a great gift for older friends (40+) who will relive the glory times of this incredible band.
3,Worked better the first time....,I used this product about a year ago and was absolutely stunned at how it wiped out odor we had due to poorly behaved cats. One year later we have a similar problem and I locate more of the product and I don't get near the same results. I applied it in the exact same manner and did not get near the same riddig of odor that I wanted. I haven't given up hope and want to try another application but it seems less effective.
1,A Great Disappointment,"When I first read about this book I was very excited, but reality fell far short of my expectations. The text is in an awkward script font and the attempt to convey Machiavelli's concepts to an audience of ""children"" is stilted and insluting. The illustrations are garish, ugly reproductions from classic children's books (such as Alice in Wonderland) and rarely corrolate to the maxim they are meant to depict. Don't waste your time or money on this book."
3,Not very purple,"I used a sharpie as others described to turn it purple, but I was disappointed that in darkness when the light was activated it looked almost white.When I used a purple sharpie on it, it became a more vibrant purple and came a lot closer to the color I was looking for."
1,Horrible,"Trying to use this book to actually communicate with Koreans is a painful process. All of the translated text is in Romanized format. The Romanizations are not standard either. At best, Korean pronunciation is difficult to express in English characters but the method used in this book guarantees that Koreans won't have any idea what you're trying to say. Futhermore, because the writers don't print anything in Hangul, you couldn't even show Koreans the book to get them to understand. Buy Barron's ""Korean at a Glance"" instead."
2,A very basic book that might not be enough to get by with...,"It provides a list of several words that you would need if you were in a primarily Korean-speaking area, and provides a couple examples of sentences that you would use them in, both in Korean and in English, but it leaves several important phrases out that might end up becoming very useful. It probably would be sufficient for any quick trip where you wouldn't need much, though."
4,fulfills its purpose,"This book never claimed to be a comprehensive guide to the Korean language. I'll be going to Korea to work soon, and I needed a guide with a fun approach, so that the task of learning conversational Korean wouldn't be so daunting. The book claims to offer ""a basic introduction to Spoken Korea or just a few words to get by on a trip."" It helped me to overcome the phobia of learning a new language, so I believed it fulfilled its purpose."
5,Bella's first braclet,We got this for our daughter and love it. She loves the way it jingles and it is so cute!!
2,Not my favorite cappuccino,"When I couldn't get my favorite instant cappuccino, I tried this Swiss Miss variety pack. The flavors are not smooth and creamy. The individual packages are annoying since I like to use a variety of mug sizes."
5,WEDGITS,"I bought this for our great grandchildren and they love them! They are so proud of the ""Christmas Trees"" they build with them. It keeps them entertained for quite awhile...and I love them, too!"
5,Great fun,"Wedgits are a very fun toy that the whole family can enjoy together. Plus, they added the words octahedron and rhombus to my two-year-old's vocabulary! The sides did get a little worn after a year or so, so they only get 4 stars for durability, but otherwise a great toy."
4,Fun toy,It is a fun toy. My children have it and I bought it for their cousins. They love it as well!
4,Wedgits 30 Piece Deluxe,Bought this for my daughter when she was 4. She is now 6 and still plays with them occasionaly. Lots of ways to build with them. She brings them out whenever kids visit because most kids enjoy them. Even older kids and baby sitters get involved.
5,execellent open-ending toys to inspire imagination,"i bought this Deluxe Set for my 6-year-old son. he enjoys it a lot, played with it hours every day. my 3-year also are able to build sth interesting from it. execellent open-ending toys to inspire imagination, suitable for wide age range... strongly recommanded and plan to buy more wedgits set"
5,Will be a staple through many ages and stages,"I am very pleased with our new Wedgits set. After Christmas, when all the toys were laying out around the Christmas tree, this is the toy, my 3 year old son (our little builder), kept coming back to. He's created so many different kinds of towers. What I love is not only how engaged he is, and how sturdy the set it, but the depth at which it can go. My husband and I sat down to try to figure out some of the possibilites pictured in the included brochure, and really enjoyed the challenge it posed for us. I foresee this set continuing to be a staple in our house through many different ages and stages!"
2,Wedgits Deluxe Set - 30 pieces,"I was very disappointed to discover that the White Octahedrons (10 pieces) were very small. I own another set (Wedgits Starter Set) where this piece is much larger. The information on the Wedgits Web Site did not mention that there was more than one size. If I had known before I ordered this set, I would have purchased another Starter Set where I would have had 15 useable pieces compared to having only 20 useable pieces in the Deluxe set that I purchased. The 10 pieces are small enough to fit in a snack size plastic bag with room to spare to give you an idea how small they are."
3,Not up to Bondhus' usual standard,"I was looking for ball end hex bits for my ratcheting magnetic screwdriver and these were the only ones I could find. Unfortunately, they are a bit long for the magnet, and surprisingly, for Bondhus, the smaller bits broke much too easily."
2,Be careful with the smaller diameter bits,"These work great unless you're using the smaller sized bits. I have a Bosch Impacter that I use to drive these and I've broken two of the medium/small sized bits. I don't recall the sizes but they were for 1/4-20 and 10-24 flat head cap screws. It was a royal pain trying to remove the screws after the ball end broke off -- it required grinding a slot in the head of the screw in order to use a screwdriver to try and break it free. Not fun at all!I still use the larger sized bits, but I go back to hand wrenches when I need to work with the smaller sizes. I just don't trust them!"
5,Great Blaxploitation film,"Compared to todays horror films, this was funny but a good look at how far the film industry has come!"
2,i really don't know about this movie,"this movie is very strange i guess when your a child everything looks good but if your into this kind of movie your like it but i'm grown now and i'm a real horror movie freak and this movie didn't really do anything for me believe me if you can rent it i'd do that first before you buy it ! if you can find it in any video store i only gave it two stars because it was a little funny but other wise please think twice before you buy this movie- 5/25/2008 revisted i don't care how many people hate on my review of this movie it will not make no difference to me i still think it's bad i mean it's so bad it's funny to me, so far 6 people didn't find my review helpful at all oh will i'm not saying that nobody will not like this movie because it takes all kinds it may be good to some people but not me i'm sorry if my review is up setting some people but like i said it's just not for me so hate all you want i really don't care sorry"
1,EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTING!!!,Cinefear has done a horrible job with the release of this DVD. The picture and sound quailty are terrible. I paid $20.00 for this DVD and it is not even worth $5.00.
3,Rated R,"While very accurate, if one wishes to get phrasing with the common touch with one foot out of the gutter don't buy this book. If you intend to hang out in the rough this is for you. I know, what a prude. Just looking for the common touch, not the Andrew Dice Clay sexual assault."
4,Solid book,"Contains lots of slang and is very thprough. I tend to agree with other reviewers however, this should be treated essentially as a vocab book, since no converstions are really present. If you want to see how slang is used in conversation, perhaps StreetWise French by Ian Pickup and Rod Hares and/ or the Dictionary of Colloquial and Slang Expressions by Struth are better choices. That said this book is fun to read and does provide exercises for you test your knowledge. If you study this book and apply it correctly you wil become la gosse legume avec ton amis francais!"
3,good slang vocabulary book,"This book does contain lots and lots of slang words well arranged in categories. Somewhat lacking are examples of how these words are used. This should be treated as a vocabulary book rather than a book to learn to speak and understand slang. It is hard to learn to speak the real french from a book containing list of words. For that, one will have to pick up an audio tape and books containing dialogs."
5,80s retro alternative band gets a great remix,"The Editors have definitely studied their alternative 1980s bands, with great hooks and melodies. And brilliantly, this isn't the first time they've handed remixing responsibility over to Cicada, who knows how to make the best new wave dance sound out of anything they touch.Totally awesome."
5,Good Instruction,"This dvd gives good instruction on how to dance an erotic routine and is easy for beginners to learn. Step-by-Step instruction is given then the combo is reviewed. Walking, floorwork, and chairwork are all covered and the final routine is very sexy looking! You will need a miniskirt, button-up shirt and a armless chair for the routine, but the dance can be modified if these items are not available. A bonus performance by Lady Morrighan will knock your socks off and give the beginning dancer some good tips!"
5,Only the Best...,"This video was great! All the others I have watched made it so complex, yet this one made it fun and easy to follow. Lady Morrighan teaches both the dance routines and the body language that really makes it sizzle. This is the best DVD yet!"
1,Did not recive it,I did not recive this product. I was hoping to learn befor my husband got home but I guess not
4,not exactly what i expected,"this dvd accomplished what i intended. I built up my confidence and learned how to perform a striptease for my husband. Although i expected more from this. moves seemed a little simple. i didn't do exactly the same routine, adjusting to my needs. it was a good start, i am thinking of getting another one."
3,BEGINNERS,ITS DEF FOR BEGINNERS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.I LIKE THE LEG FLOOR WORK.VERY GOOD.I GOT A FEW THINGS FROM IT.ITS SENSUAL AND SLOW.IM MORE FACE PACED BUT THIS ONE IVE GOT TO DO CAUSE I NEED TO SLOW IT DOWN.PERFECT IF U GO OUT ON STAGE.SIMPLE.DEF W TURN THEM ON
3,Use new cards,Tried to use this item on Phase 10 cards that are a couple years old and it was having trouble. But seemed to work at least half the time.
4,Great Scale,This is a great scale for a great price. It's amazingly accurate. I've weighed myself on previous scales that I've owned and would get different readings every time (depending on how/where I stood on it). This scale is not a all tempramental. Any scale by this manufacturer is a must have.
2,no memory,Please notice that this scale does not remember your weight from one time to another ! You will need a peen and paper to track your developement.
4,This is more a question than a review,"I just receive this scale today. So far I would say it is rather easy to setup and the weight is at least consistent and I hope it is accurate. However, it is only allowed to store up to two people's personal data which is kind of annoying when there are three people in my household. And there is no short-cut way to use the scale without entering personal data.Now my biggest question is how the body fat is calculated. Even though the reading is consistent each time, when I switch my personal data from male to female, just to play around with the scale, my body fat suddenly jump from 14.5% to 26% even though my weight reading, height and age remain the same. Either the calculation is way off or the formula it used is gender-dependent, hopefully it is the latter. Anyone has an idea?"
2,EXPENSIVE SCALE,"I bought this scale because of the reviews. There is no way this scale measures fat. According to Tanita my BM is 28, but even though I have lost 16 lbs the scale shows me at a healthy weight, but my fat at 41.5, which is where it was when I started. I feel all I have is a pricey scale, not a fat monitor, which is what I needed."
3,Inconsistent; OK if you only want general idea of bodyfat/wt,"The scale is inconsistent. The only thing it is consistent about is its inconsistency. Often, I would weigh myself and get a reading of, say, 23% body fat. Then I would weigh myself an hour later and get 20% body fat. I understand that a person's weight fluctuates throughout the day, but I sincerely doubt a person's body fat fluctuates throughout the day (not to mention hour by hour). Also, I have tried weighing myself at the exact same time each day so as to give the scale a fighting chance w/ regard to the normal day-to-day body fluctuations...and there is STILL inconsistency...not by a pound or two or a percentage or two...but sometimes even by 5 lbs.If you just want a general idea of what your weight and body fat is, go w/ this scale. If you're a person like me who is trying to lose a small amount of weight (therefore making accurate readings very important) then do your research and go for a better model."
3,"pretty nice, but only for the die-hard Monroe fan","I found this book to be a valuable source of unpublished material, both letters and photos, but judging from the recollections of her half-sister, their relationship was not close enough to give any new insights. However the pictures and letters gave me great joy."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!,"I love, love, LOVE this book. A must have for any Marilyn fan! A view from the only family member of Marilyn's (besides her mother). A truly unique look into her life! Also, its obvious how much Marilyn adored her sister and niece! Once again, showing how much she longed to be loved. Gives alot of background on Marilyn's parents (well at least the man listed on her birth certficate). It also includes pictures I had never seen before, espically of Norma Jean in her pre-Marilyn days. A delightful read until the very end!!"
4,Good book to read. Sisters together forever.,"It is a good book to read. The two sisters met together and then they stayed together with their mother until Marilyn's death. It is just story about two of them together with Marilyn's niece and their mother. Maryilyn gave her old clothings to her half sister and her niece. They write each other letters, etc. It is a good book to read. If you are a Marilyn Monroe fan, then you should read this book. Read it with your favorite coffee or tea."
4,A moment of sheer nostalgic pleasure,"I purchased this book as a birthday gift for an old friend with whom I grew up in the fifties. And it did not disappoint. While many who watched this king of the bad men throughout his black-hatted career might not remember his name, they certainly would recall his face. I highly recommend it as an adventure back in time and a great opportunity to see the real Roy Barcroft apart from the actor."
5,Roy Barcroft King of the Badmen,"A good look at our favourite badman in the movies, but he had many sides to his character"
5,Love these!,My boyfriend loves these! We buy more when he's getting low. They are individually packaged so they travel well. And they work excellent on glasses and phone screens.
4,The Lens cleaning towelettes,"was a gift for someone, therefore I don't know how well they work. I was very pleased to find them online."
3,Book could be a lot better.,The Hot Wheels listings did not include variations nor did it include limited edition cars. The Match Box listings did not list the names of the series of cars. The Johnny Lightning section is very limited. Pictures were very limited in all sections.
3,Hot Cars,Very Easy to use. Very Clearly written. The only thing I didn't care for in this book is that to some degree it only covers the most popular cars. It doesn't give information on the amount produced. It also doesn't give any information on the amount of variations of newer cars. Clearly this is not written for the advanced collector
2,disappointed that i spent the money/time on it.,"I was very disturbed that there was very few pictures to show the vehicles. How is a collector new or old supposed to know what the vehicles, colors, and vairiations are..? to top it all off many vehicles i found weren't even listed, but then again you are never given the opportunity."
5,Classic,"Daughter needed this book for school so I bought it here on Amazon, it arrived in time and who doesn't love a classic. Good book."
3,It shows us communication!,This book is very laid out so to speak. The story is followed word for word. If you miss one part you miss the story. The topic was very nice and well thought but in my honest opinion it needs to be updated. You can tell the story was written years ago! The plot is all together boring in my opinion!
2,Aaaarrrrrrrrggggghhhhhhhhh !!!!!,"An inspiring story, but a difficult book to trudge through. I never have enjoyed reading the scripts for modern plays - it's so much better to watch them being performed. I'm not sure that either of the Hollywood films has really captured the essence of the story, but watching them is certainly more enjoyable than reading this book. The only way we could get my daughter through it (for a 6th grade assignment) was by reading it out aloud and giving the characters ridiculous accents (for example, Captain Keller became a pirate). Only get this book from the library, and even then, only if you have an assignment to do !"
1,Corny BOOK!!,"This book was awkwardly written since the beginning. I think there are two many stage directions with not as many words. The stage directions were boring and the words had no life in them so that was boring also. I don't think that Helen could have acted that badly with all her disabilities. I also don't think that Annie's eyesight was that good because back then they hardly knew what a surgery was. How Helen able to talk at six months. How was Helen even going to remember hat her first words were? How was Helen able to know that something was wrong? I don't think it was a masterpiece, I don't think it was beautiful written, I think it was a really corny book."
1,Not a CyberPunk Book,"This book is not a CyberPunk book. I thought it was and bought it, but it turned out to be about some deaf, dumb, and blind chick. This book does not mention computers, exotic drugs, or bleak urban decay. It may be a good book if you like deaf, dumb, and blind people - but I'm not into that."
5,"A touching story of people losing hope, except a teacher...","I read The Miracle Worker on my own as a class assignment, and I am very glad I chose it. It was a very touching story of how Annie Sullivan helped Helen Keller out of the silence by teaching her how to do sign language. It was almost like a journey, watching all the events that Annie had to conquer while teaching Helen. Annie was a brave, young woman who was also half-blind. In short...I found this a wonderful, and most rewarding story to read."
4,A good play by a non-cyberpunk,"I read the play in sixth grade for school, and liked it. Vivid, clear, what else can I say? I also like William Gibson's cyberpunk works. However, the William Gibson who wrote The Miracle Worker is not the same William Gibson who wrote Neuromancer. They're two different men. In fact, the script writer was born in 1914 and the cyberpunk writer was born in 1948."
5,Wonderfully written!!!!,I read this book in my 8th grade english class and could hardly put it down. I thought it was wonderful. It gets an A+ from me and is a must read for everyone who likes heart touching stories.
3,It was a good book,"I enjoyed this book because the book has really good charecters in it it and they are really active.And the book is also very funny because the charecters like helen do very funny things, like helen eats off of other peoples plate and she is always mad happy or sad or she is always hitting people. It is also funny when Helen tries to show people when she is happy or sad because she is handycap it makes it look funny. The book and the movie is almost word for word.There are a lot of charecters in the book so sometimes it is hard to keep track of who is talking and who is doing what. But it is a good book and i think some people will like it better than other people would."
1,Utterly inadequate,"The book fails to provide adequate information required to perform its own problems! If this book were to actually *explain* the material in a straightforward fashion, the problems would be feasible to accomplish without referring to other sources."
1,Fifth Edition had answers in the back of the book,"I went through my introductory class using the older edition, which had answers in the back of the book to most of the questions!!Why are there no answers in the back of this book? It's the instructors job to make learning circuits challenging, not the author...and I wish my school had stayed with the older version.Someone needs to provide a copy to some of the answers to the end-of-the chapter problems, FOR FREE!!"
2,Solved Problems?,"This book has minimal solved problems. Of the few problems that are solved, the author fails to provide any thought or steps used to solved the problem. He simply believes it will suffice to simply give you the answer without any reasoning or background. I would not recommend this book to learn circuit analysis"
3,Not thorough enough,"This book just does a terrible job explaining some of the material by not fully explaining everything. For example, there's a section where you need to take a transfer function and you need to find the magnitude and phase of the transfer function. The book just tells you what the final answer is without showing any calculations or even explaining the method of doing it. It's still stuff like that which makes this book horrible to self teach yourself from."
1,A book that must have imaginary rating,"How could one become a good electrical engineer after reading this mess?I have to rely on books from the 90s to understand the material better.Definitely should be burned, no doubt about it."
1,electrical engineering undergrad,"I agree with one of the other reviews. This is by far the worst electric circuits text that I have had the misfortune of being forced to use. The examples are rudamentary, as are the general explanations, and inadequately prepare one for the homework problems. I have taken electric circuit theory at the community college level and the texts used for those courses were far better. However, since I attended community college some time ago, I fear that the texts I used at the time are currently too outdated for recommendation."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I used this book for my introductory circuits class three years ago and, upon reflection, it was one of the worst books I was forced to buy in 4 years of engineering. The examples are too trivial to help with the problems, which are too hard because the explanations are horrible. My teacher wasn't much better at explaining the material, making this the worst class I have ever taken. But after taking more advanced circuits classes, I find them to be less appalling."
1,terribly written,"reasons I wouldn't go with this book:1. poor pedagogy, i.e., easy examples, but unsolvable problems2. not necessarily very up-to-date, lacking in innovation, extremely old-fashioned3. there are surely better written books on Circuits out theree.g.: Alexander&Sadiku; (which is an easy but great read), or Dorf (which is pretty decent)"
2,A book that does not work,"If you are new to circuits, and don't have an amazing instructor, this book will make you work for hours just to finish a few problems in the exercises. The examples in the book are ridiculous, cause they are so easy. But wait till you get to the exercises, you will know. It is true, if you can learn to do the harder problems, easier ones will be no factor. But you NEED to learn first, and this book is in no way a self- teaching book. The ability of the writers to communicate with the readers is almost non existent here."
3,Older editions were better...,"This one seems to suffer from tremendous clutter and excessive detail. It is best to concentrate on the basics, and solve lots of problems, via examples and workable homework problems, avoiding the intellectual trap of trying to make PhD's out of freshmen. My favorite is still Elementary Circuit Analysis by Bobrow, a 1981 edition! It is full of examples and can be used for self study. Stay away from this book unless you have no choice!"
1,Example problems are inadequate for homework.,"As an EE student, this book is good as a basic overview, yet lacks real examples which provide an understanding needed to do the homework problems. Due to the fact that the solutions are not included, the homework problems are too diffcult for the beginning student to answer."
5,Cannot I give 5 more stars?,"It's an example of the perfect book. It's a novel on circuit analysis, and yes it's pretty much academic and calculus based, which makes it an excellent choice for EE schools. There are some minors in the content, lacking some minor details which I think are embedded in the exercises. One more thing that makes it a perfect it is not polluted by PSpice screen shots and its binding is not crippled by an attached CD. I love the cover too. Very professional peice of art. Great job authors!"
5,decent book,"decent book. it wasn't outstanding. it didn't suck, like my teacher did. ha, gotta love paying so much to be taught by a half assed instructor."
3,Good for the price,Good for the price. I learned alot. Don't need the new edition. Not much detail though. You need an instructor. No self learning with this book in my opinion.
2,Problems Are Too Complicated,"During my first semester of Circuits, I loved this book, but I came to find out during my second semester that it was not the book but my professor that was teaching me well. Primarily, my problem with the book is that it offers too few examples dealing with the actual homework problems in the back. If you read and work out the (on average) four examples in the chapter and then begin the problems, you will find the content very different and more difficult. Occasionally, after three reads through the chapter and some outside sources, I was able to work some of the problems, but overall, they are not structured on the chapter topics and many of the problems are poorly worded. The solutions in the back are also in an inconsistent order, appearing to offer solutions only to the easiest of the problems. I enjoy the reading, but the problems need to be redone, or the reading needs to incorporate some of the ideas in the problems."
1,Please don't buy !,"Many college in Korea use this book as original text book. So,i bought this book after questioning to bookclerk woman, ihad studied really hard this book throughly.BUT, THERE WAS NOEXPLANATION OF KERNEL OF ELECTRICITY,THERE WAS NO COMPREHENSIONABOUT ELECTRICITY AND RESISTOR AND CAPACITOR AND FLOW OFELECTRON. So i had teared this book, and bought ""introductionto ELECTRIC CIRCUIT"" written by Dorf/Svoboda. this is reallyexcellent and great! i had falled in love with electricity."
1,Very inadequate,"This book only brings sorrow and aggravation into a student's life. The book is not thorough in its explanations and the problems at the end of each chapter are too hard compared to the example problems. There aren't any degrees of difficulty, many of them are anything but easy! This book is not recommended to use in any EE class!"
3,Graduate Student Review,"My motivation for purchasing this text was for an undergraduate level course on Linear Circuit Analysis in Electrical Engineering. The text was somewhat useful with clear illustrations and formulas but lacked the clarity desired to grasp a full understanding of the material from simply reading the book. As such, the text was primarily used as a reference source when lecture material failed to provided enough depth or coverage of a particular subject area. In summary, I would recommend purchasing this book if required but I would look for another text if you are simply trying to get a better understanding of the subject"
1,authors an idiot,"this is by far the worst circuits book, i have already found several mistakes in his examples were he is wrong. the book is completly unorganized. you would do alot better going to youtube."
4,"Very good, but get solutions","I'm a Computer Engineering major at Florida International University in South Florida, and I really only have good things to say about this text. Despite having had less-than-great professors for Circuits I & II, I feel this book has been indispensable in my understanding linear circuits.I understand many readers are discontent with the fact that this book doesn't contain ANY end-of-chapter solutions. I completely agree with that sentiment, and that is why I only gave the book four stars. However, the solutions manual is obtainable, and it is very comprehensive. The book and solutions manual combined provide a formidable tool for learning basic circuitry.On the other hand, if you're unable to get the solutions, this text, just like any other, would certainly make it difficult to get confident at solving linear circuits."
1,Forget it!,"This book is not even worth 1 star. I won't bother you with the details since some of the other reviews posted are right on, especially that long one I saw by SDP_8. I will add that I wouldn't sweat about not having the solutions available. There are plenty of online sites where you can look that information up for any text book, just ask any of your fellow students. Because of this book, I transfered to a local Technical College for EE for more hands on. I have lost all respect for Engineering Courses at major Universities. All book, little or no labs, and your judged on how well you do on tests from worthless and confusing books like this."
2,A complete waste of money,"This book is a complete waste of money , now I know why I failed the subject at college ... better buy a couple of beers and pizzas is a better investment in your future."
4,Electric circuit 8th,The book came in on time in the good condition. Amazon is one of the best websites ever I've chosen to look for what I need.
4,An effective textbook for circuits classes,"I used the second edition of this textbook in my sophomore EE circuits classes. The textbook is well written, and provides thorough explanations of theory. The number of examples presented is limited, however, and much of the development problems for any give subject appear as homework problems. As a reference, this book is only for those who have taken circuits courses from a good instructor."
4,Very Good,Book came with a small defect on the front edge and a scratch on the back. Otherwise looks brand new.
2,Lacking,"This textbook is missing so many of the key ingredients that make a good textbook -- I am still amazed at the large amount of instructors that continue to use this inefficient and lacking text as their main instruction manual.Using this in a circuits course probably will not help you and will make the subject more confusing most likely. If you have a poor instructor as well, consider yourself lost for the class. Get another text. The examples in here are so simple but then the homework problems make these conceptual leaps that prove quite challenging for students -- even engineering students.This book needs quite a bit of improvement before I would use it as my main circuits text."
1,Not Worth It,"This book is [costly]for what it's worth. I am a CS student and after taking the Digital Circuits class, wanted to learn some electric circuits out of interest. I wasn't taking a class in my university (Univ. of Idaho) but this was the required book for the introduction to circuits class. So i bought this, and tried to learn on my own.It was a nightmare. The basic concepts aren't explained well at all. The introductory chapters are just for the sake of it. The author uses a lot of calculus in places where it's not even required. If this is the required book for the first EE class, then I can assume many would have a wrong impression of EE and drop out.I read Schaums or however thats spelt, and that made life so much easier and simpler..Analyzing the circuits even in Nilsson's book was easy.Final Word: Don't read this book..Atleast if you want an introduction / window into Electric Circuits."
1,Not worth the paper it is printed on!,"I had to purchase this book for my intoductory ECE class, and I ended up dropping the class unable to understand the concepts. The examples provided were extemeley easy and basic, while the problems at the end of each chapter were horrific and ecclectic bunches of components. There was no explanation of how to work them, and few answers to check your work by. I have re-enrolled in the class under a different professor using a different book, and currently earning an A."
1,Waste of time.,"This book makes me mad with rage. None of the major proofs which are essential to understanding electronics are presented. You want to know why phasors work? Well too bad, this book wont tell you, only how to apply phasor analysis, what good is that if you don't understand what your doing? This seems to be the theme of this book. If you wish to truly learn electronics look elsewhere."
2,One of the worst textbooks I've used.,"I did not find the explanations or examples in this book to be very helpful. As with most text books, the problems at the end of the chapter sometimes go way beyond the scope of the literature."
2,Horrible Weeder Textbook,"The homework problems were absolute hell to solve, with tons of complicated algebra. Even worse, the text gave superficial examples that gave no hints on how to approach more difficult problems. My grade suffered in this class, partially because it did not focus on the fundamental circuit analysis. Don't expect this book to help you on exams!"
1,Very Bad Book,"I'm currently an engineering student and have seen my fair share of technical textbooks. This is one of the worst textbooks I've come across. There are no good examples in the books (the only examples are missing complete solutions) and the chapters are worked through with very simple theoretical circuits with nothing complex to base your understanding off of. The authors also completely neglect units when making calculations, which is a huge problem when dealing with this kind of material. they simply make a calculation and throw in a unit onto the answer at the end.the major problem with this book is the lack of SOLVED EXAMPLE PROBLEMS. a textbook is no good without step by step explained applications.overall, this book is a bad excuse for a textbook. if you can, stay as far away from it as possible."
4,"completelly understable, but not big explanations","it is very understable, you can read it and understand it even if you aren't a native speaker. The problem is that sometimes problems(ironic!) are very hard and you are not showed before how to solve them."
4,piano lessons can be murder,This is a great book one of R.L Stines best.It is about a boy that finds a old piano in his new house.He takes lessons but he thinks theres something very creepy about his piano teacher.When he finds out how creepy he's teacher really is he finds out a shocking secret.I recommed this book to kids ages 8-10.The pages won't stop turning!!!
5,Piano Lessons Can be Murder:,What happens when you find an old piano in the attic in your new house? You take piano lessons of course!!! That's what happens to Jerry...Doesn't sound scary does it? Well after going up to the attic he keeps hearing moaning and groaning that keep him up. And many warnings not to play the piano by a restless ghost. His mother enrolls him in piano lessons from a newspaper add. The place is in the middle of nowhere. And he likes the lessons until he finds out some freaky secrets!!!Read the book to find out more!!!God Bless ~Amy
2,The best Goosebump. Ever.,This Goosebump book which gives you both chills and laughs is my favourite Goosebump. The way Stine describes each character is quite impressive. Goosebumps's fans will get a kick out of this one !
5,Better Stay Away From The Piano!,"This book is one of the best ""Goosebumps"" books, this one actual scared ME! The ghost in this book, freaked me out! When Jerry found an old piano in the attic of the old house he moved into, he wants to start taking lessons, but that's when he starts hearing a slow, sad song in the middle of the night! When his first lesson came around, the ghost did too, Jerry gets a warning from the ghost: ""stay away from my piano""! What happens to Jerry and the ghost? I guess you'll have to find out for yourself and jump out of your skin while reading it! Enjoy!"
2,Too touchy-feely,"This is not a book for die-hard theorists. It is a nice little book on horse psychology (as the author sees it) and a plea to be kind to the horse (can't argue with that). However, it does not get at the foundation of dressage in any meaningful way, so something more concrete (Mairinger, Podhajsky, Steinbrecht) would be more worthwhile."
1,Porn Without the Full-Frontal,"Remember the kind of porn they made back in the early days of video? Actors who couldn't say ""hello"" and make it sound convincing; sets that looked like they were built in the corner of somebody's garage; sound quality that wasn't; clumsy camera angles that left actors stranded in midrange trying to look natural; dumb dialog; cheap music; lighting that simulated the effect of overhead florescent tubes in a Chinese laundry? Well if you're nostalgic for all that, this is the movie for you. But unlike the old porn, there's no nudity, no hard core ... anything but hard core boredom. Truly the most amateurish piece of movie-making I've ever seen ... I gave up after about 20 minutes. And, no, don't tell me it might have gotten better. One doesn't have to eat an entire boiled egg to know that it's rotten. I would have given this pathetic excuse for a movie no stars at all but there doesn't seem to be a way to do that. BE WARNED!"
1,DO NOT WASTE A DIME!,"This was the most poorly made movie i think i have ever seen.... Well we got through about 13 min of the movie and then gave up. I think they had one camera for the entire filming so you only see one angle , as if the tapped the camera to a spot and left it in one view. Also the acting made me feel like I was watching a highschool theatre show. this movie gets a negative one star!"
1,Did not care for this product,"I purchased this product after viewing quite a few favorable reviews, while at the same time disregarding some of the unfavorable. Not taking heed of the unfavorable reviews was my error.My problem with this product is it's consistency and how long the lubrication lasts once applied. This lube is basically the consistency of Baby Oil, I find extremely difficult to apply without making a mess.Not just that, but because it's so thin, it literally drips EVERYWHERE and seems to lose it's viscosity extremely quickly because it doesn't stay in place. It's sort of hard to explain...Basically, I'd classify this product as Baby Oil which is latex safe (safe for condom usage). I definitely wish I had went with the ID Pleasure lube instead. (which I have used before and know is good)Think long and hard before you buy this item, if you already like the ID Pleasure version don't even bother trying this out, it's a waste of money."
5,best ever~,this is the best lube I have ever used. I would highly recommend it to anyone and will never change...
2,"I-D Mill, Silky Smooth",I did not care for this one because it is to thin to do any good and did't last very long.
5,His first and his best,"This was his first album and definitely his best. All the songs bring back many happy memories of 1985, the year which I spent living and working in Italy. I'm so glad I found it on amazon as my original cassette tape was destroyed a few years ago."
5,Universal truths about mothers and sons and strawberries.,"There is no doubt that the Mama suffers from a combination of disorders (depression being key) and told as it is from the boy's perspective he no doubt shoulders a great deal more than his young years perhaps should. But for a brute narrative in tolerance as well as retribution,this charmingly illustrated story can't be beat. I must disclose that I find this the most ideal book for a mother who is also a teacher in her son's school, especially one who respects his capacity for independence whie coping with her own private caveful of demons. (It is especially poignant if you have a red-haired family and live in a rainy climate.)"
1,Not all I had hoped for,"I did not like the book because of the confusing theme. My wife and I debated a long time before we finally decided that this book was not suitable for our 4 year old. Not only is a child tied to a tree and physically assulted by bullies, it does not make it clear what the consequences of that type of behavior actually are. The ending of ""dessert for everyone"" complicates an already confusing theme. I am unsure of the moral and would have a hard time explaining it to my daughter. The artwork is colorful, but it is also somewhat frightening. The cover is just a taste of what lies inside of this book. Not recommended for young readers, at least not in our house."
5,Norton Systemworks,"I have relied on Norton for many years and some slowdown in download sped may have been affected, it still beats having your system compromised. Havn't had any real huge issues"
1,Norton Systemworks Failed Me,"I paid for a one year subscription that was not set to expire until Jan 15, 2008. I did not receive 52 weeks (1 year), I only received 50 weeks then my subscription was deactivated because I would not renew two weeks early. I made more than 4 attempts to correct this issue.I was ripped off and I will not EVER buy another Norton product ever.I now use ""McAfee Total Protection"" which is a superior product anyway."
1,will lock up your computer= JUNK,"installed fine but everything ran super slow [ new high end laptop with 1 gig of memory ] in one month it locks up, cant boot, costomer service gave advice that didnt work, paid computer tech $81.00 to remove it. JUNK"
1,Computer Programming in Visual Basic 6.0,"This text is fairly easy to read and does a good job at organization and using applicable examples but has far too many errors, mistakes, typos and inconsistencies. In some chapters, I have found errors on almost every page. Some mistakes were so critical that they made it difficult to understand the relevant concept. Someone should have done a better job of reviewing this printing before it went to press. Maybe after the 2nd or 3rd printing is will be a good short coarse textbook, but frustration will probably result for many students if corrections are not made. Also, some syntax was used without any explanation (i.e. colons were used on page 135 in lines of code and not explained what they do until the next chapter). Hopefully the second half will be better as I am only half way through the book so far."
3,"beautiful earrings, but...","These earrings looked beautiful and I'd love to give them 5 stars, except that since the post is made of sterling silver, which is very bendable, just be careful when handling them. I accidentally smooshed one of the earrings and the metal band holding the stones easily became slightly loose. But for this price, you can buy several of them. I wish these came in 10k or 14k white gold :("
3,Made my ears itch,"I thought they looked very nice, but they made my ears itch. My ears do well with gold and sterling silver usually."
2,allergic reaction,"I usually don't have a problem wearing sterling silver but cannot wear cheap earrings that are just of any metal. They have to be sterling , gold, or made for sensitive ears. These say sterling but still caused an allergic eraction within just a couple of hours of wearing. The retailer, however, did not have a problem e mailing me a free shipping label for return."
4,nice stud earring,I have been wearing this earring for 1 months. It 's very nice about the quality and the price is not expensive. I think that's a good earring to buy!
5,sterling silver zirconia,Beautiful earrings; large enough for an adult to wear; too large to make-believe are something else than zirconias. Great for everyday.
1,Body fat measurments very suspect....,"I bought this scale hoping to get accurate body fat measurements. One day, I measured myself according to the directions. Then I picked up a 20 lb laundry basket while still on the scale and (not surprisingly) my ""body fat"" percentage went up 5 points. I am inclined to think that if it was really able to read my body fat, than even if my weight goes up (i.e. as with added muscle weight) than it should be able to accurately read that and not simply add to my ""body fat"" percentage. In my opinion, save your money and get regular digital scale. This scale's reading is bogus!!"
3,Original Greatest Hits,"I not really reviewing this CD, I'm looking for the 1979 Eddie Rabbitt Greatest Hits (Electra?). I've got the cassette (2nd copy), and have looked everywhere for the CD. I don't think it exists, but I'm not giving up the search. The cassette is ALWAYS in my road trip box and I don't know what I'll do if/when it wears out. If anybody can help me out, I'll be deeply indebted!!"
5,EDDIE RABBITT BOX SET,"I agree with alot of the people reviews here. I bought this cd and was disappointed. There is alot of hits missing. Why is it that Lionel Richie, Kenny Rodgers, John Denver, and countless others, can come out with box sets but Eddie cannot.The record companies need to wake up and release a 4-5 compact disc set that includes all of his best hits and songs."
2,What was EMI thinking?,"Why did Capitol owned the rights to such Eddie's classics as ""Step By Step"", ""You Can't Run From Love"" and ""Someone Could Lose A Heart Tonight."" He must be rolling in his grave about that. One of these days, Warner Bros. will get their act together and buy back his 1981-1984 recordings."
5,A simple little book on prayer,"Martin Luther's barber once asked him to instruct him regarding prayer. This little 62-page book is Luther's reply. He lovingly, warmly writes his thoughts on regularly praying the Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments, and the Apostle's Creed. And Luther does not simply call for a thoughtless, legalistic recitation. Rather, he advocates pouring ourselves and everything we have into these prayers, fully involving our minds and hearts. Read this book, be blessed in your prayers, and learn what it means to pray to ""Our Father."""
4,Package Quantity,"You only get 6 packs of 20 not 6 packs of 40. So it is not quite the bargain expected. I contacted the seller but they just shrugged it off. They have not even corrected the description just said that they always just sold it in packs of 20. Amazing that no one picked up on this before. The tea is good. I love chamomile as it can be used for many things such as upset stomach, pink eye (just soak a cotton pad in it and put it on your eye). It also makes blond hair really shiny and pretty. It is also very good iced, very refreshing."
3,Stale and not at all fresh,"The tea that I got here was stale. I would not recommend buying this tea here, especially since it ends up costing alot more (if you have to use twice as much tea). Plus you can't return it."
4,Delightful indeed!,"I thought i'd try something new to help me mellow out & relax at the end of the day & have found this a helpful, tasty way to do it. This is not my mother's tea for sure!!"
5,"Great Tea, Great Taste","My husband and I love this tea - it soothes the stomach and it relaxes you. It tastes good, too. We drink it every night. We have been subscribing to have it sent from Amazon for a long time now and are very pleased with the arrangement."
3,"Some notable cuts, but not Steeleye's best work","The posted review actually summarizes this CD quite well. Worth owning if only to hear ""Drink Down the Moon"" and ""Edwin"". The songs featuring the ""St. Eleye"" primary school choir (sheesh) grate on my nerves a bit... As a basis for comparison, I would give their ""Tonight's the Night"" release 5 stars."
3,Now We Are Very Much Improved!,"To many die-hard Steeleye fans, Now We Are Six marked a turn for the worse in their music. With their decision to start using ""modern"" instruments such as electric guitars and synthesizers, and to use murky sound and dark subject matter in their choice of songs, Steeleye Span created an album that was not nearly as pleasing as their previous attempts. Happily, this import version makes some much-needed improvements. The sound quality is noticably better, which helps to make the songs easier to appreciate. But the real gem is the extended, six-minute plus version of Thomas the Rhymer - while the original American version is a throwaway bouncy pop tune, the import version contains extra lyrics which Maddy Prior delivers with delightful charm and delicacy. This track alone makes it worth the revisit. Throw your domestic copy of Six away and purchase this one!"
1,Save your money,"Save your money, like other review tha batery dosen't work, all i have is 10 minutes of charge."
4,Finally a book that talks about Storytellers!,"This book is the only book I could find which talked about the kind of business I want to start. Not only was it affordable but it cuts to the chase when it gives you info. For example:It gives you start up costs, potential earnings, typical fees, advertising, qualifications, equipment needed, home business potential, staff requirements, handicapped potential, hidden costs on top of how to get started. This book is a great find!"
2,Disapointing,This is a cute short story. Not much to do about football as the cover suggests. Just a short story about how two brothers spent a summer.
4,Awesome Book!,I read this book about two brothers side by side. They do a lot of sports like Football and baseball. The next day they went with a friend and then Ronde biked up the mud and he broke his leg. Rondes leg healed and then he was able to play sports. They played Football at a middle school stadium. The Football game was going to begin at night. At the end of the game they won.I liked this book a lot. I liked this book because it was a nice story about two brothers side by side working together.
3,Kids love it but quality is lacking,The kids love this towable and my 4 year old was able to ride with the big kids and feel safe (and his Dad and I felt safe having him in it). It's very stable but gives the kids a fun ride.The issue is that the fabric around the stabilizing fin was torn after the first day of riding. This didn't effect the ride but I'm worried about how much longer it can hold up. I tried calling the manufacturer but got put on hold forever and have not had a chance to get back to it. I would hope they would stand by their products and offer something to repair or replace this one. I'll let you know when I hear.
4,"Setup, part deux","Mike Carey, Lucifer: Children and Monsters (Vertigo, 2001)Carey's second book delving into the story of Lucifer gives us a much better idea of where the story's going. How does this odd little girl who sees ghosts fit into everything, and what's going on with Michael? No answers yet, but Carey does give us enough of each thread to let us know we're supposed to be following them somewhere. It's still setup, but it's fine setup, as is to be expected from Carey. Series is getting stronger. ****"
4,"If you like his books, his comics rock!","Carey doesn't disappoint in his Lucifer series. A little bit more melancholy than his books, but still kicks a**."
1,"Inline Boxed Tube 12-1/2"" x 2-1/4"" , Schrader (standard) Valve","The product looked to be new and in good condition, however once installing while transporting in the back of my pickup 35 minutes) it exploded. I had 35psi so I don't know what happen but I will not be reordering the same product."
5,A Marino must have!,"An excellent album from the first to the last track. Aside from the great rockers for which Marino is so well known, check out ""Look at Me"" and ""Lady"" for insight into Marino's abilities on fronts way beyond the rock realm. The jazz runs are superb on these tracks. This is a must have, not only for Marino fans, but also for serious guitar players and listeners."
5,Best of the Best,"Started by ""Requiem for a sinner"", a strange melodic peace of rock, Frank leads us through a kaleidoscope of modern rock, timeless, steamy...and without any dull moment. Rockers, Hymns, Jazz-touched ballads...you will not miss anything If you ever like to collect 70's rock records, this CD is a ""must"" for every guitar junkie.Frank Marino's best record ever made!"
4,Thank You Frank,"Back in 1988 I was turned on to Frank Marino from my sister's boyfriend.Though their romance may not have lasted,mine with Frank has.This was the first Frank album I'd ever heard.Back in those days I was a straight up thrash/metal head,but something about this guy just caught my attention.Needless to say I've been roaming the planet looking for anything I could find from Frank.""It's begun to rain""..timeless and classical,since that day I've pretty much owned everything Frank has put out.He is truly a ""Guitar God"" in my books.One day this man will be put into the ""Rock & Roll Hall of Fame""..as the song states.Next to Steve Vai,he is truly a GOD!"
2,a dissenting opinion,"The concept behind this book is interesting but it's art work holds no appeal for my niece. For example, O's representative of an olive is not a beautiful green mediterranean olive but a gray olive that looks more like a rock with a red center. T is a dry looking piece of toast. I like the unconventional choices just not the artwork."
2,Lazy authoring.,"I have no problem with the visuals. They are terrific.This was a gift for my child, and I wanted to use it to teach my toddler the alphabet. I was disappointed in the word choices to represent the letters. I understand that you don't have much room for creativity with the letter ""X"". The letter ""P"" is an entirely different story. The author chose ""partridge"". Really? When is the last time you or anybody's heard, spoken, or written the word ""partridge"" except maybe during the holidays? There are thousands of other words that a baby is likely to hear on a daily basis that begin with the letter P. What bugs me the most is the letter ""Q"". The author chose ""quotation mark"". How's a child who doesn't know the alphabet supposed to know punctuation?? The picture is of a [ ' ], which can be more appropriately described as an apostrophe rather than a quotation mark."
5,Easily goes far beyond the usual a-b-c primer,"It's hard to peg this presentation: Laura Vaccaro Seeger's The Hidden Alphabet's fold-out pages mean it's unlikely to remain durable enough for library lending, yet its unique approach to an artistic look at the alphabet deems it of interest to an older audience than the usual alphabet book would appeal to. Nonetheless, fans of artistic alphabet presentations will find The Hidden Alphabet easily goes far beyond the usual a-b-c primer, inviting fresh perspectives on alphabet art."
3,"Great MP3 player, but broke in less than a year.","The MP3 player itself is great, the features, the software, the device, however I bought it in October 2007 and it broke in summer 2008. It just stopped working while I was listening to it, and never came back on. It was under warranty so I got a replacement, but still with the expensive price, you would expect it to last longer than 7 or 8 months."
4,pinkybomba,it's a good unit...no real bells or whistles to speak of. should have ordered the 80 gb since in one sync I've already filled the 30 gb ;)
1,Disappointed,"We purchased this Zune as a Gift, and when the person went to use it, it did not work. They contacted Zune and were told that there was a problem with the battery and that the item was out of warranty. We had purchased it through AMAZON less then 3 weeks prior. When we contacted AMAZON, we were told that we could not exchange it, as the seller did not have another exact one. We are VERY DISAPPOINTED with this purchase, and we hope that AMAZON will refund our money, not give us credit!!!!!"
5,Great Service!,"The Zune 30 GB was exactly as describe from the product review. The customer service was excellent! The issues I had with the software were dealt with in an impeccable manner. I do not typically give reviews, but I was so impressed with the service I just had to do it."
2,"defective products, poor return policy","Zune worked great XMas (first) day, but would not turn on again after first recharge. Amazon was great about taking the product back (sent back before the new year). Only thing they didn't tell me was I won't get a replacement till Feb 28 (earliest). Hopefully next one will work???"
1,Very high infant mortality,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas. She loved it -- until it died two weeks later. The screen went blank. It couldn't be shut off, nor could any menu choices be made. The hard drive could be heard whirring inside, until the battery ran down. Recharging didn't help. A difficult-to-understand customer service rep had me go through a series of tests and finally determined that it was, indeed, dead. We returned it in a pre-paid shipping box and received a different one a month later. That one also lasted about two weeks before it started showing the same blank screen symptom. If this keeps up we'll go through about eight of these before the warranty is up."
5,My daughter LOVES her new Zune!,"I purchased this for my 14 year old daughter, and she is very happy. This is her first music player that also plays videos, so she is really excited to be able to watch videos. It is also very simple to load videos from You Tube and music into her library. I am seriously thinking about getting one for myself now."
2,Not user friendly,"I was very excited to own this product. But when the setup turned into a laborsome 7 hour ordeal, I began to wonder why I had spent all that money for something that should be a piece of cake. Oh yes, and don't forget about the big hooplah that you have to go through to download, transfer, and eventually find out it doesn't use all the different formats that music is available to us. Great concept Microsoft, but the typical consumer doesn't have time to jump through hoops and tame lions just to listen to music or watch videos. I returned it."
3,It had to be MICROSOFT! Incompability with other languages,"The zune itself is great, but since it's microsoft I was afraid something would not work. Quickly it got me right... If you conect the ZUNE to a PC with windows XP in any language but English it won't work, so watch out latins or Canadian people, if you don't have Windows XP in English you will have a problem. I can't believe the ""Microsoft Zune"" has imcompatibility issues with ""Microsoft Windows"", and Microsoft hasn't published any solution, any patch, anything.."
1,Horrible,"If there wasn't canned laugher after every punch line, no one would be laughing at the horrible jokes in this mess."
4,"Great Show, Mediocre DVD","If I was reviewing only the show itself, I'd give it a solid 5 stars. The characters are fun and likeable, and the dialog is quick and smart. It's one of the best shows on television, and the first season is the best of the series. However, the DVD seems to be put together in a very amateur way. To start, while the show was originally aired in 16:9 aspect ratio, the DVD crops off the sides to create a 4:3 aspect ratio known as ""fullscreen"" (or ""foolscreen"") before everyone had 16:9 widescreen TVs. In addition, much of the music from the original show has been replaced with different songs on the DVDs. The original broadcast music fit perfectly with the show, but when watching the DVD, it feels like something is missing.Despite the drawbacks of the DVD, I'd still recommend Season 1 of How I Met Your Mother because the show itself more than makes up for the DVD's shortcomings."
3,How I Met Your Mother Season One,"Overall it is in pretty good shape, but some of the episodes skip which is very disappointing since this was not mentioned in the product description."
5,Funny!,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my sister. She had Will & Grace, all seasons and wanted something new. The humor is funny, witty, and just fun to watch. The DVD came quicker than expected. Overall, I'm happy!"
5,Great dialouge and plot,"This show is truly hillarious and deep. This show hits every emotion. This show makes you smile/laugh, get angry, worried, embarrased and sadden. The characters are alive and have their unique personality. Barney and Ted are interesting characters. I can't wait to purchase season two. I show everyone my season-one and right away they become fans."
2,I don't get it,"I bought this show because I love Alyson Hannigan, and because it has such great viewer reviews, presently 5.5 stars on average. I am just confused. This show just did not impress me in any way. I love sitcoms, I have like four shelf-meters of DVDs with just those. But this one not even Alyson could salvage. The actors did what they could, but the stories were run-of-the-mill, the writing uninspired, and it simply was not very funny.Also the basic setup, where a guy is talking to his future kids about ""how he met their mom"", but it quickly becomes clear that we'll probably never find out who their mom is... not a good idea.I hate to be a wet blanket, but maybe other out there feel like I do, and just didn't say anything because they're as confused as me."
5,FINALLY!!!!!,I couldn't wait for this to come out. It is by far the best comedy ever.I don't know anyone that has seen this and didn't find it hysterical.
5,Best new sitcom!,It proved itself in season 1! Buy it and you won't regret it! Each character plays off of each other so well. The show is seamless in that there's great continuity!
3,Worse season of this show,"But the show gets much, much better so keep watching.Season 1 is okay. Season 2 is good. Everything after that is gold. So persevere.(To be clear, this season is still enjoyable and central to the plot, so you should watch it.)"
3,WHY is this full screen?,"I LOVE this show. I was overjoyed to see season 1 out so fast. But I am appalled that it is being sold IN FULL SCREEN MODE ONLY. This show is shot and broadcast in HD. Sure, selling in DVD (and not HD-DVD nor Blu-Ray) makes economic sense for now. But selling it solely in full screen mode is just unfathomable. What were they thinking? PLEASE OFFER THE WIDESCREEN SOON! YOUR FANS ARE WAITING!"
2,"Series, 5 stars. DVD, -6 stars.","I love this show. It's one of the best written and best acted sitcoms in years. I've been anticipating this box set since CBS mailed the pilot on DVD to select magazine subscribers.Imagine my disgust after finally purchasing the box, and discovering that Fox decided to only release it in pan and scan format, literally costing us a third of the action. There is no excuse nowadays for releasing a DVD of a show shot in 16:9 HDTV in 4:3 format. If you want to get a copy of this series, either track down the widescreen versions, or wait for Fox to come to their senses and release this set done correctly."
2,just not my type of humour,"I know that a lot of people enjoy (and it is good for them!) this tv show. In my case, truth to be told, I am not into this kind of humour/jokes.The actors/actresses are ok, I guess.The jokes are funny if you are into this type of humour. Not my case, unfortunately.And after several seasons, there is a ""sense of deja vu"" that it is not very good.But like I said, if people enjoy this show... excellent! It certainly is a tv show that is good and nice for the fans.Just not my type. That is all."
1,Poor dvds,"The 1 star is for the dvd release, NOT the show!Why, oh why, Fox has released this only in FULL-screen?!Seriously, the widescreen & HD version looked so good, why would anyone want a cr*ppy full-screen version?That's just plain stupid..."
5,Great Product...,"Received my product very quickly. Though the case for the dvd was broken, I suspect that happened during shipping, the dvd's were new and worked great. Thank You."
3,Gift for family,"I have written this review 3 times in the last 2 years... can this please be the last time? ""It was a gift."""
4,What views!,"For anyone planning to soon or in the future visit Egypt, this book is a good eye-opener to the where and when of the archaeological sites in the region! For those interest in Ancient Egyptian history, this would appear indispensable, along with Sabbah's Secrets of the Exodus and EGYPT: Land and Lives of the Pharaohs Revealed."
1,Not worth the shelf space.,"This book was published in Great Britain by Thames and Hudson in 1991 as ""Egypt from the Air"". I have just checked out a copy of that book from a public library and my comments relate to that edition.Only about one-third of the book is devoted to pharaonic Egypt.The photographs are very grainy. Many were taken in the early morning and/or late afternoon and therefore have a pinkish hue.The text is journalistic.Flick through a library copy before you even consider buying this book.Save your money for a copy of Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness TravelGuide to Egypt."
5,Awesome,"we have been following them for years now and they have not failed to put out awesome music. it is inspirational, spiritual, and up lifting. To see these guys live is a true blessing."
1,Typical,"In the song ""Typical"" the singer says, ""Can I break the spell of the tpyical?"" I wish he would have before they made the album. Their music has a unique blend of sounds I want to enjoy, but the same gimmicky fake high dynamic range visual style used on the album art is applied aurally to the music and consequently gives it a gimmicky, blunt and WAY too overdriven sound with hardly any... dynamic range. The lyrics are lackluster, and forgettable and remind all too much of Sting's verbal meanderings. Break the spell, please.Gimmicks don't make for good music."
1,Retrospective of Jane's Addiction and 90s prog rock.,"Unfortunately I had to give these talented musicians one star for their effort here. Their music is trite and unoriginal but the main problem is that none of the songs really take off with inspiration. There aren't any catchy melodies that make you want to dance, jump, or sing along. Everything seems tried and tired. Their second release was a little bit better than this."
2,-,I didn't really like this album. I think it's lyrically unimaginative and the songs end up sounding mostly the same.
4,Glad it was recomended to me...,"I asked my guitar teacher one night what he was listening to lately and he said he saw a group named Mutemath live and thought they were fantastic and that was all he was listening to lately. So I went out and bought their 2 cd's and wow! They're amazing as musicians. Great songs and sound quality. Please put your cd's of Coldplay, Killers, Nickleback and others alike down now and get Mutemath. They're better I think but that's my personal opinion. I gave it 4 stars cause it really isnt a 5 star cd like most other ones out there that people give 5 stars. If a beatles cd or ""The Wall"" or Nirvana are 5 stars in the critical world- then you cant give other random cd's 5 stars if they're really not at that level... critically speaking though- we all love our own stuff. And I can honestly say this and their EP (which I may like a hair better) are fantastic cd's."
3,Easy Listening,"I saw this band by accident in August 2006 at the V Festival in Chelmsford, England. I'd never heard of them but had arrived at the tent early to ensure I got in to see Lily Allen who was performing next. Mute Math rocked and were a wonderful suprise. They started off sounding like the Police but as the set wore on they got heavier and heavier mixing in some terrific samples with superb guitars and drums (the drummer was so enthusiastic he taped his headphones to his head to stop them flying off during some of his antics). The crowd loved them.I bought the CD off the back of one live performance and was a little disappointed. The studio sound is good but there is none of the energy and rawness I experienced in the flesh. Too many songs sounded like the Police and although that is not a crime in itself I know they have got a better bigger sound and their own personality. I gave this 3 stars cos its OK to listen too but I crave a slice of the live set."
3,"Mute, mute, mutemath!","Ok to be frank, the first song I heard from Mutemath was ""Spotlight"" from the Twilight movie soundtrack, that song was cool, it was upbeat, catchy and memorable I had heard that it was made up of two of their existing songs and remastered for the movie. So I decided to go and check out these guys, I brought their latest CD, and well, its alright. I read an earlier review complaining about the repition of the lyrics in the songs. For me that is good, these songs have enough repition, which makes the songs get stuck in your head, you'll be bopping it down the street, humming or cranking out lyrics like ""I know you stay true when my world is lost"". from Chaos - which on this CD is my favourite.There is a lot of digital enhancement in their music, so if you aren't into it, don't buy the Cd. But if you are into, Indie, Alternative and or Techno, THEN GIVE IT A GO!"
4,Different sound earns rave,"I loved this CD. MuteMath is an indie group with fresh music and meaningful lyrics. These are not your typical boy-loves-girl, boy-loses-girl themes, although there are a couple interesting 'love' songs here. The style and soundtrack is different enough to keep my kids and I interested, and the digital sampling is intriguing. I can see why this group was hard to categorize, but the music is worth hearing."
3,tied in blood,Not very chilling movie short on good story line and good script for 99 cents people can try and give their review
1,aweful,"this movie was aweful, at least the daughter was good looking, i lost intrest after about 5 min, total waste of money"
4,TROUBLED SPIRIT WE ASK THAT YOU COMMUNE WITH US,"In an isolated farm house, George (Kenneth G. Hodgson) believes his family has been killed by a ghost. He hires Robert Brandon (Paul McEwan) a man who believes he is a medium, but works for a company that uses ""smoke and mirrors."" The movie is sharp and crisp until Robert manages to conjure up the ghosts of Robert's family. At this point you ask, ""What happened to the ghost makeup?"" Each ghost tells a different story of the events of the murders/killings.Denise Cooke plays the wife Gillian. The son, who is not quite all there is played by Chris Leach. The lovely Laura O'Donoughue (please don't get a nose job) is the sister who cares for her brother a little too much.The ghost movie is deeper than most ghost stories, but it is far from a horror film. The special effects were minor when they were used. I enjoyed the film, but the ending was too anti-climatic. 3 1/2 starsF-bomb, sex, incest theme, nudity (Amie Morris)"
3,What the heck is killing them ???,"This was a good little who-done-it,We would always blame people dwelling in a haunted house or ghosts in the least.The cast was was very real as a family unit,Facing a tragedy head on.Some of the family has died and the father wants answers and goes to a NIGEL LYTHGOE looking spirit medium.The shocking revelations and Ghost effects are worth watching ."
4,Father's Nightmare Comes True,"What could be more horrific than coming home to find your family murdered? But that's just the beginning of the psycho thriller about a man who seeks a solution after his life is forever altered in the most hideous way. As he unravels the mystery, he finds out the answers may be just as frightening as the murder itself."
3,Not a bad movie,It was different the way this movie was presented. Not like the typical ghost story.It was different but in a good way.
4,Lots of twists,"This is a true old school psychological thriller, the kind of movie that doesn't rely on cheap gore to get it's point across. If you are a fan of classics like the Omen, the Exorcist, the Shining, etc. you will enjoy this."
2,"Abridged, with no warning on the front",I mistakenly purchased this without noticing it was abridged. It seems dishonest to only mark this on the back but not the front of the text.
5,lighter translation,"there is a countervailing advantage this edition offers against the princeton volumes even though its abridged... this is a lighter and smoother English translation. English is not my native language, but I believe many American readers would find the Hong translations as tough-going as I did (even if meticulous). Kierkegaard is already very wordy so this translation is a pain reducer."
3,"Great on Weight, poor on Body fat","I have found that the weight is extremely accurate. But the Body fat is waaaay off. From day to day, it can fluctuate from 10% to 15%. This is a huge swing. I always weigh myself at the same time and the same way. I spend a lot of time at the gym, and I know I didn't jump from 10% BF to 15% BF in a day. I always get off and try it again. In a 3 day period it weighed me at 10%, then 15%, them 8%, then 12%. I don't trust it"
3,If you have small feet BEWARE of this scale!,"I have relatively small feet (size 5.5 shoes). For an accurate measure on this scale, either weight or body fat, you need to have full contact of your feet on both the front and back sensors. I've found that impossible due to the size of the scale compared to the size of my feet. So if you have small feet you might want to look for another model/brand.I've also found that the body fat % is fairly inaccurate and tends to fluctuate even during the day. After some research, I discovered that most people find their weight to be closest to ""true"" weight if they weigh first thing in the morning and their body fat % to be closest to the ""true"" % when they weigh last thing at night. It seems that the body fat % varies according to how hydrated your body is...and evening weighs (greater hydration than in the morning) seem to be more accurate."
2,Worked good for a little while.....,"but then it would only display my weight in stones. I contacted the company and they had me send it back to them. I will be receiving a new or refurbished model, not the same scale though. I think they are replacing it with the BF682."
3,Picky Picky,"I liked this scale for the first six months. Don't trust the body fat percentage--it runs about 25%--or 10 whole points--off what my trainer and her calipers determine it to be. Plus, depending on how recently I used the restroom, etc, the ""fat percentage"" changes. I WISH fat burning worked like that!After about six months, the body fat percentage and water percent just plain stopped working. It now tells me what I weigh, but claims error from then on out. I wouldn't buy this scale again, I'd buy a cheaper digital one and rely on my trainer for the fat percentages."
2,Not for beginners or intermediate swimmers,"I swim a mile every morning and was looking for the proverbial breakthrough. This book was not it. The historical development of the various strokes (first part of book) did not get me any closer to a breakthrough, nor did the last part which is dedicated to historical statistics.Illustrations are not helpful; the few pictures (all black and white) are in no way instructive. Training routines are all in jargon that is not explained.If you want a breakthrough I highly recommend the Go Swim DVDs. This book is of little use."
4,My Dog Loves it!,"All the pieces fit my 2006 polaris ranger very well, I did have to cut two small slits in the cover for the seat clips in the back of the seat, but other than that the fabric is like a nylon cordura mix, it helps hold you in the seat but doesn't have that ""sticky"" feeling like neoprene has. Best of all my golden retriever's claws don't damage the cover!"
5,Cool,"These are very good looking, easy to put on, and save your seats from wear and tear. Everyone comments on how good they look."
5,The beautiful and eccentric voice,"As I am, you'll never be disappointed by her beautiful voice. Unlike any other great singer, her voice seems to be soft, smooth, and may be a little vibrated. The collection of song is great and not a popular combination too. Her record is hard to find in the US."
4,Nice Shoes,"I purchased these boots because I have another pair of Aerosoles, that I've been wearing for almost 3 years that are SO comfortable. The heel is a bit high for me, which makes my food slide down to the frong (maybe they run a little big)? I do get a bunch of compliments on these shoes though. Overall, I am not dissapointed."
2,Probably best left obscure,"I bought this album when it first came out. At that time I was a teenybopper in the South SF Bay Area (now known as Silicon Valley). I thought it was really cool. I held on to it for years. I the late 80's I borrowed a friends turntable and duped it onto cassette tape. I was really excited to listen to it on drive up from LA to SF. After 20 min of listening to it and 20 years of listening to many other kinds of music, I was really disappointed. I realized that these guys were simply not as good as I thought. Tower of Power's horn section was ans is soooo much better than these guys ever thougt about. Terry Hagerty's guitar is incomprehensible (and that is not good).I thought it ironic that Bill Champlin actually started playing for Chicago.I guess if you have fond memories of putting this on and getting stoned out of your mind then it might be worth buying, otherwise don't bother."
4,"If you are part of the Moz militia, read it!","Anyone interested in the beloved Morrissey will enjoy this book. I am a Moz and Smiths fan, and found that the topically divided quotes help to define his personality, point out how disparaging he is of himself, and that he is a true chameleon. It is fascinating. The only criticism I have is that the quotes are quite dated now, and as Moz is always ungoing rebirth, they may not represent him and his career now."
4,Great short book on MOZ,Great for any Morrissey fan. Contains great pictures and it's not that much reading. It touches mostly on the early days of his solo carreer. It's definitely an easy read.
4,How Much Stories Should be In This Compilation?,"Quite interesting generally, but there are some stories I simply don't understand.I found several of the stories to be well written and beautiful, particularly those with a clear Christian/moral basis. I particularly enjoyed the title story and ""What Men Live By"". These two stories showed a real grasp of human nature and presented memorable insights.On the other hand, the military stories are hard to read and the language is basically 19th century gargon to me. I'd love to see a modern version of ""The Two Hussars"" for example, where a more current setting and scenario may help to clarify what the story is about. I stopped reading ""the Woodfelling"" about half-way through because it just wasn't going anywhere in my opinion.I'll buy it again to be honest, because there are a few gems in it...and who knows, maybe I'll re-read the other stories in a few years and be better able to grasp their meaning."
5,I love this trash can!,I love this trash can . it is compact but can hold a lot of garbage. It's metal so it doesn't hold an odor like plastic and is so easy to clean up should you have to. I was a little puzzled on how to put it together but if you have a power screwdriver you can force the screws into place. It is also very solid once you get the screws in. I highly reccomend it. I am infact here today ordering my second can for my aluminum recycles.
3,Hmmmm..,"The description states, no drilling and all hardware included.. Well, I had to drill 4 of 6 holes, I had to buy $8.00 worth of grade 8 bolts, nuts and washers, it came unboxed and beat up, so I repainted it.. Needless to say, I wasn't amused.. If I wanted one that needed to be drilled to fit, I could have gotten one cheaper elsewhere.. Other than that, it looks like a nice hitch..PS... It was shipped very quickly.."
2,Good Concept; Poor Execution,"A disappointing purchase, this cannot be the last word on the subject. The book is a pretty dry read. Bill James has printed similar types of essays in various books in a much more lively and entertaining style. Also, some of the methods used and assumptions made are very questionable. (I am an MBA with over 20 years experience in compiling and using statistical data.) Felber's book can only be recommended to the really hardcore fan who is willing to wade through a lot of really boring prose."
2,Very disappointing,"I was really hoping for a fresh, new take on an old topic. But instead, it seems that ""The Book on the Book"" merely regurgitated the work already done by Palmer and Thorn over 20 years ago.The author does not appear to have a background in statistics or logical thinking, and unfortunately it shows. On subjects such as the sacrifice bunt, for example, he draws conclusions without analyzing game situations or the quality of the hitter at the plate. Folks at web sites like Baseball Prospectus, Hardball Times and Baseball Analysts have covered this topic in much more extensive detail, thus delivering more meaningful conclusions."
2,"If this is a landmark, then I'm very lost","This book presents a lot of information in an uninteresting way and doesn't break any new ground.One of the first chapters by Felber states that the best hitters hit early in the count as once hitters have worked themselves into 2-strike counts, their batting averages drop sharply.Of course they do. That's because with 2 strikes, you can strike out on the next pitch. With 0 or 1 strike, a batter can do a lot of things with the next pitch, but one of them isn't striking out. And striking out is the end result of a lot of at bats.The chapter on bullpen usage makes some sense, but the examples given are presented poorly."
1,kill me now,"This is so corny, so poorly acted, and so absurd that the producers should pay customers to see this movie instead of the other way around. If you bought this in the $1 bargain bin, you paid too much."
5,This music makes you smile,"I first heard Mint Royale on a various artists cd featuring ""Shake Me"". That one song stood out from all the others, and I instantly fell in love with it. I decided to find out more about the group, and listen to more of their songs. I downloaded about 3 on Napster, and ordered the album. It took over a month to get here, but it was well worth the wait. Lauren Laverne's vocals are awesome. Chris Baker and Neil Claxon really seem to know what they're doing. I can't wait for their next album! ""From Rushholme With Love"" is also a memorable track."
1,Not worth the money,"This is made of such low-quality foam that it flattens to almost nothing when you sit on it, so it gives virtually no cushioning."
1,Duro-Med Convoluted Cushion - Save Your Money,Calling this a cushion is an oxymoron. It does not provide any cushioning whatsoever. I'm only 140 lbs and this thing goes flat when sat on. Recently had surgery and was trying to get some cushion for my tosh.
2,TWO OF THE MOST BIZARRE MURDERS....NOT SIX,"I think people here are getting excited about nothing. Happy Birthday To Me states on the box cover ""Six Of The Most Bizarre Murders"" and I only saw 2 bizarre murders,the scarf caught in the motorcycle and the weights crushing someone. There is nothing other than what I mentioned thats unique or bizarre,just getting stabbed by objects isn't unique. Also the movie is slow paced with an ending that doesn't make up for it. I just didn't buy the ending,its to fake. It makes me think the director threw that idea in at the last minute. BOTTOM LINE: WORTH A RENTAL BUT NOT WORTH PAYING A LOT OF MONEY FOR..."
3,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE BUT IT IS NOT WORTH$60.00.WHEN IT DROPS TO ABOUT $20.00 THEN BUY IT!
5,GREAT 80'S FUN!,"As if you couldn't tell from the DVD cover: this movie is AWESOME! So much fun to watch. There's some pretty creative kills here (a skewer of meat?! C'mon!!), and a rather complicated story with a great twist at the end, especially for 1981. As long as you can stomach 80's outfits, hairdos, and catchphrases, there's no reason someone wouldn't like this movie. So, to sum it up: watch it already & enjoy!"
3,Better than I expected,"The story centers around some private school students at Crawford Academy. They start disapearing one by one by an unknown killer whos on the loose while the main character 'Ginny' is trying to figure out whats going on and where her friends went. In the middle of all this shes having blackouts and flashbacks from her mothers death and some brain operation she had in the past and trying to piece together the mystery of where everyone went and trying to figure out who the killer is.This movie did have some different inventive murders though the ending was a little disapointing, though there was something about this movie. It was a little different than the regular stuff. I liked this movie but I think it had too many plot twists and was kind of hard to follow at the end. There was so much going on and different details and suprises though the whole atmosphere and who dun it thing kept me interested. I would recommend it to horror film lovers. You might like it."
4,Creative Slasher that satisfies.,"""Happy Birthday To Me"" isn't going to win an Oscar or any other Hollywood awards but It is a good retro slasher flick.Creative for the genre ,a genre that I love.I hear people complain that there's not enough blood or gore in it ,blah blah blah..but I am a die hard slasher fan and it satisfied me.The kills are creative and the plot has some good twists and a satisfying ending ,you have your jock ,nerd, popular girl, new girl, and all the usual suspects .Glen Ford lends his talent and name to make this movie more credible , and you also have Mellisa Sue Anderson of Little House On The Prairie fame as the heroine .and a young Tracey E Bregman of The Young & The Restless who gives an impressive performance.Instead of the woods you have a collage campus as the setting.If your into 80's slashers this movie satisfies, it's a must for the collector."
2,I have to agree with everyone else...,"I am honestly suprised as well. I do not know what happened to the original score. The score for Happy Birthday to Me inspired many movies of that time including Motel Hell and The Children. I was fully expecting the macabre score to begin upon the start of the movie and instead there is a disco track. I mean, I know how someone could believe that disco music could be just as terrifying, but it just was not the same. I am thankful that I do have this movie on VHS. The only part of the original score that made it into the movie was the theme sung at the end during the credits. Very disappointed."
2,What Happened?????,"I would have given this movie 5 stars, but i was completly surprised when the score of the movie was taken out...I have been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD since the DVD player came out!!...( The Score ) is one of the key ""roles"". That was one of the most important elements of the movie. The movie itself is great, One of the best and smartest horror films ever made!!!! The score was replaced by some really bad cheesy music that completly takes away from the films creepy mood and eerieness, and If you have a chance, skip the DVD version and try to get a VHS copy off ebay VHS version is definetly worth the money ... STAY CLEAR OF THE DVD"
2,Average slasher flick.,"This FRIDAY THE 13TH knock off claims six bizarre murders when there are only four. Melissa Sue Anderson plays Ginny; a high school socialite who may (or may not) be responsible for the grisly offings of her uppity peers for an accident that claimed her mother's life. I admire the chutzpah of its depravity, but I've seen better. By the way, did anyone notice that SCREAM mirrors this plot?"
3,"like a bad car wreck i can't turn away from this cheese ""slasher"" movie","the movie is bad,i mean real bad. murders happen in ways that would never happen in real life and i counted at least 3 if not 4 ""twists"" in the last 10 min. alone. the acting is bad,but like i said i watch this one many times and kind of like it. well there you have it i guess i have to say i like it some."
1,poster 1 film 0,"god, the poster for this movie intrigued me when i was young. along with the exorcist and dawn of the dead i longed but was afraid to see these films wondering what on earth could be in these films that was so shocking. fast forward many years and i have the answer (for this film) - nothing. its crap. pointless red herrings, dull boring characters, twists with no logic or reason except that the makers want a twist. if you're just coming to the party now don't bother, its old, stale and lives firmly in the past. purchase for personal nostalgia reasons only."
3,ITS NOT UNCUT SO WHO CARES!,"This is a good slasher but its not a great slasher. The columbia release a few yrs back has the original artwork inside as an insert which you can easily slip over the lame dvd cover so, really all your getting here is the original soundtrack, ""who cares"", Its an ok slasher its not saturday night fever (soundtracks not crucial) the older dvd release soundtrack is fine with me, if they were to release this film uncut then thats a diff story i would have givin it 4 stars but the kill scenes are a tease in this film, and it seems were not getting an uncut version as it stands."
1,Rave reviews for this one?,"Come on, whoever gives this more than one star, and let's face it, that's one star too many already, enjoys senseless slasher horror with bad effects and a nonsense plot. There is no justification for this movie to exist. You'll have more fun throwing your $12.99 out of the window."
4,Happy Birthday!!!,"I watched this movie for the first time and I thought it was pretty good. It's actually different than I thought it would be. I loved all the twisted kill scenes. Virginia ""Ginny"" Wainwright is getting ready for her 18th birthday party, but all her friends keep dying. Another part I loved was all the dead bodies sitting at the table, around the birthday cake. It was creepy. I highly recommend HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!!!"
1,"Sad. Just sad, sad, sad, sad, sad.","If I were King of the World, or at least at Sony Pictures Home Entertainment - let me just say that heads would roll with regards to this product offering. I loved this movie as a kid. Sick as it may seem, along with Grease and Little Darlings, I watched this movie over and over. But after seeing the new incarnation of this film - the only thought I was left with was ""Why bother?"" This is a completely different film because of the soundtrack changes that have been made and this new film isn't frightening nor is it interesting. Furthermore, if there is one thing that bothers me even more than changes to the actual film it is changes to the artwork and packaging. The promotional artwork for a film is where I find an emotional attachment to a movie. The artwork they replaced this new package with is unexceptional in every way, just like the new version of the film. Especially this movie, it had great artwork! Uggg."
2,"""Birthday"" No Present to Fans","I know music scores sometimes are a holdout to DVD releases. What once was a chilling, suspenseful horror film has turned into a run-of-the-mill suspense yarn. Imagine watching ""Jaws"" without John Williams score. It would not be the same feel. Here, Columbia must have felt that the film was so old no one would remember. Horror fans are loyal, and we hate the fact that they feel just getting the title out would appease us. We want the original film. We have waited patiently, and well we are still waiting. The video transfer I must say is excellent, too bad the audio sucks."
4,Dead Teenager Movie with a Alfred Hicthcock Twist.,"When this movie was released it had to compete with several teenage horror movies sparked by the Friday the 13th craze. I think it holds its own and them some. Given that most of the people who were seeing this movie all ready had the attraction of seeing little Melissa Sue Anderson, 'Mary' from Little House on the Prairie fame heading the cast. The murders are clever and this was part of the sell. 'No one will be seated during the last 10 minutes of this film' the adds screamed. These gimmicks were enough to get me and most of my 15-17 year old friends to run to the theater. The movie was one of the top grossing teen horror flicks for years! The ending is a surprise and leaves you with good discussion questions. I remember that none from the group I saw the movie with guessed the killers identity. Even the title song which plays during the end credits is creepy. The only drawback to adding this film to your collection is the current selling price."
1,WHO REMADE THE SOUNDTRACK??????,"As a teen, I remember seeing this movie and loving it...I finally purchased it on DVD and when I began watching it, I was horrified...Not because of the blood, etc but because of the ""something out of '70's cop shows"" score! It is probably the worse score I've heard and it's also awfully loud, too! This new score took away the suspense from the movie...Can the DVD please be redone and it's old soundtrack brought back? Then I can return mine to the manufacturer and get the real ""Happy Birthday to Me"". Bring the original score back and I will change this review to 5 stars! Thanks!"
3,Happy Birthday to Me with original score,"I recently bought this movie a week before for it's being released for five bucks, not bad if you ask me. I don't know why but this store seems to always release a dvd before it's actual release date. Anyway, I owned the print with the different score but I never really got thru the whole movie. It boasted six of the most bizarre deaths but I didnt think they were that bizarre. I thought this movie dragged on a bit to long and was very boring at times. It was a decent film, worth a look, but nothing i'd go out of the way for. The dvd is barebones with just a trailer and that's it. If your a big fan of the movie then I suggest you go to the store I bought it at."
3,love the film hate the new cover art,"whats with dvd company creating new artwork for classic films from the 80's just to sell it? die hard fans remember the old vhs versions of these gems with original cover i mean is it that hard to release a film with original artwork and sell it as it was . at least it comes with a insert of the original cover art which i find better then this crappy girl on the cover who wasn't even in the damn movie LOL...i wonder if this one will have a remake in the future being that is the new trend in hollywood , with prom night , terror train , motel hell and others on the rise in the next coming years ."
4,Happy Birthday to Me - An Exciting 80's Slasher Movie,"I was quite pleased with Happy Birthday to Me. Let me just say it is NOT a blockbuster movie. But for 1981, it wasn't half bad. The special effects were kind of cheesey, however, the acting for it's time was pretty good. I'm sure that nowaday's with the same plot, and maybe a different title(cuz the title is kinda corney) this movie would do excellently.I was not impressed with the death count however. Almost half the over-sexed, booze induced kids lived. However, the plot, kind of over shadows that. The viewer is definatly wondering, ""What the hell is going on?"" And also ""Where is this movie going?"".I will say one thing without spoiling the movie, I now know where Wes Craven found the idea for Scream 3!Overall, Good movie, Excellent plot, Good Acting, However low death Count. 4 Stars!"
4,Very good horror film entry,"Others put this film down comparing it to other less than imaginative horror films, but that is not the case at all. This is a film head and shoulders above the rest of the early 80's slasher films.Actually one of the best.The murderer in this movie is particularly vicious and cruel (that's what makes it way cool)obviously taking delight with each murder. (Notice the smile on the murderers face after one murder in particular?)Both funny and engrossing. Yes I agree with other reviews, the murders, at least some of them are imaginative , as well as clever.I liked the psychological bent of the film. A worthwhile way to spend an evening of video viewing. Give it a try."
2,man why ????,I just Brought This New Dvd Copy And I really Think They Destroyed It I Mean Why Did They Had To Redo The Music Score I Mean I Agree With The Others I Been Trying To Get This Movie On Dvd For A While Now And It's Not Worth It I'm Better Off Just Watching My Vhs Tape At Lease It's The Original I Only Give It Two Stars Because The Picture Shows A Lot Better Than My Vhs But At Lease It's a Lot Scary Than That Garbage That They Have On Dvd
1,Gotta rate it as a horror film.,"1st off I loved it. It was hysterical. One of my favorite black comedy's ever! It's not scary at all. This was another entry in the early 1980s slasher cycle of films that began with Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th (1980), and like many of the copycat slasher films features a holiday date-themed titles. Happy Birthday holds some promise over the others in that it had a quite respectable director at the helm - none other than J. Lee Thompson, who had made films such as Cape Fear (1962), McKenna?s Gold (1968), Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) and Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973). Cape Fear, in particular, is a masterful film noir psychological thriller. The prowess that Thompson displayed there is something that should set any slasher film light-years ahead of the competition. But fails miserably and finishes with one of the funniest horror films ever. Not scary at all. 5 stars as a comedy."
2,Did We See The Same Movie??,"Granted, ""Happy Birthday To Me"" may rise just a little above the rather braindead norm of most early 1980s dead teenager flicks. The plot did at least keep me interested. Yet I am baffled by the folks who rave over how ""truly frightening"" it is. This movie couldn't scare my kitten away from its milk! If anything, the murder scenes are so goofy and extreme, they are kind of amusing.""Happy Birthday To Me"" is a bad time waster for people who feel a little nostalgia for early 80s cheese. It's nothing more. Perhaps the dude who called this a classic can let me know what he's been smoking."
1,Soundtrack from HELL,This was one of my favorite movies from the early 80's and I was so excited to FINALLY get this on DVD...I get it and the wonderfully haunting and creepy soundtrack has been replaced by this godawful DISCO soundtrack.....This should have been disclosed on the cover....at least my VHS is still intact.
1,Stay away from this dreck!,"...Alright, the movie is basically a ""whodunnit,"" as noted by most of the previous reviewers. However, it's pretty obvious that it's NOT the ""heroine,"" as we know that there's some sort of a plot twist and all along we've been shown that she's doing the killings. Could it be that someone else has been doing them, someone who looks an awful lot like her? Oh boy...As for the main billing on the cover of the video box (""Six of the most bizarre murders you'll ever see"") I'd have to say that unless you've never seen a horror flick before, you'll probably find people who get poked in the mouth, die by throat slash, and stabbed in the gut to be pretty run-of-the-mill stuff.Finally, since the movie is called a ""horror"" film, I feel that I ought to warn you that there is really nothing very frightening about it. I went to bed immediately after watching the tape, and didn't have any trouble sleeping until ten the next morning."
2,"""Happy Birthday"" didn't make me happy!","Like other fans of this great horror film, I looked forward to its release for many years and was thrilled when I read that it was finally coming out. Imagine my shock and disappointment to hear the terrible, cheesy new score that had replaced the wonderful original. What were they thinking?! If there was a rights issue, I personally would have rather waited on the film to be released the way I remember it as opposed to this version. While the movie itself is still a favorite of mine and the DVD picture quality looks good, the new score music makes it almost unwatchable. This is a 5 star movie as I remember it. But in this newly released version? I pushed myself to give it the 2 stars that I did. Give us the version we remember!"
2,Corporate Killed the Video Star,"John Carpenter and producer Irwin Yablans have argued how vital music is to a horror film (a la ""Halloween""), and one element of early slasher films that creates their terror is the music. It's unfathomable to me, then, that Columbia released this DVD with an alternate score. You know all those people who criticize slasher films for being Gorgonzola? Now they have a valid point. Watch this DVD, and you'll find yourself rolling your eyes as the ridiculous disco music plays along to a killer slitting someone's throat. I don't understand how Columbia can withhold this movie from public release for years and then pump the money into a new score whilst ignoring a disc commentary let alone even the original trailer. Corporations should not make artistic decisions about their products; their realm is to push units and make money. Leave the actual filmmaking and sound duties to the professional artists."
3,Credit where credit is due,"As far as horror goes this little gem is a must for true fans of the genre.Why more praise or a re-release on DVD has not happened yet is beyond me.While Friday the 13th came up with real inventive ways to get butchered, HBTM took it a little bit further and introduced plot back into the story.Melissa Sue Anderson one of the greatest disappearing acts of the 80's and 90's should come out and demand that she get the respect she deserves for having the guts to shake off that Little House Mary routine and showing her fans another side of the prairie.As for the rest of the cast they hold there own and while the story takes awhile to come around the ending is true plot twist.A must see for those who prefer a little more than just a knife to the same old chest."
1,Not the same movie,Do not buy this DVD. If you must see this film rent it. Sony has decided to release an inferior product due to the fact they could not obtain licensing or they were to cheap to pay the copyright holder of the music score. This movie was very eerie and dark with orginal score now it is just plain cheesy.
2,HAPPY BIRTHDAY HORROR MAN.,"Today is my Amazon friends birthday,and like alot of my friendshere(you know who you are) I thought I would give a nod as Iwill with the rest of you on your b-days(that's right...nogetting by the C.B.,of course you can delete your birth date)So anyway to my friend HORRORMAN hope you and your familyare enjoying this special day....Now on to the review!A sullen looking Anderson stars in this fairly lavish-looking slasherabout a gloved killer(No! Argento did not direct this)doing in thesnotty kids at Crawford Academy.Could the maniac be brain-damagedMelissa or is someone else stabbing,crushing,and shishkabobbingthe cast? Overlong but well acted(a treat in horror films)good effects and a ghoulish ending sporting no less than fourtwist???"
3,Pour on the CHEESE ! ! !,"Never really a ""horror"" film, ""Happy Birthday To Me"" succeeds on a different level entirely: A stupendous 80's cheese-fest.My favorite part of the film is not the film, but the original theatrical poster, which actually reads: ""John will never eat shish kebab again!"" That's hilarious. The performances are collectively boring with the exception of Melissa Sue Anderson.It's not her fault the script takes itself seriously. Tracy Bregman (the future Lauren Fenmore on ""The Young & The Restless"") is awful, but provides enough unintentional laughs at the end, to make up of the films overall shortcomings. Anderson's brain surgery sequences are more dramatic than horrifying. What's that all about?"
1,Just my 2 cents...,"I've loved this film forever. It's a yearly viewing at Halloween for me. My VHS was looking more and more worn out, so a DVD announcement was met with much excitement. However, for everything that's already been mentioned here, I didn't buy the DVD. I've seen shots of the image quality and it looks excellent enough to make my mouth water. But all the bad comments about it still stop me from buying it. Now, it's much cheaper in some places but even so I find it hard to waste money on something that has essentually been ruined by a wrong-thinking studio.Closing: read the comments here and realise that we will all buy this film (heck, even for the price this one was listed at) if you will just restore it to its original print, complete with all scenes and musical score. This version isn't even worth 6 bucks.Thanks in advance."
2,The real villain here is J. Lee Thompson.,"Happy Birthday to Me (J. Lee Thompson, 1981)J. Lee Thompson may have directed films in Hollywood for almost four decades, but somehow they never got any better.... Melissa Sue Anderson, seemingly desperate to shake the good-girl image that came with the success of Little House on the Prairie, plays the coed whose friends are getting killed one by one as her birthday approaches. She always seems to be in the area, but just can't seem to remember actually killing anyone. (Oh, come on, you can figure it out.) Unfortunately, the only thing this movie actually killed was Anderson's burgeoning career as a serious non-typecast actress. Special effects, direction, etc., are about what you'd expect from a bargain-basement Halloween clone. There are some good lines, though, and one character has a pet rat. So the movie is saved from complete destruction, but not bymuch. * 1/2"
1,Not the original theatrical release. Sad.,"I watched this movie when it was released when I was a young teenager. I clearly remember how gory some of the scenes were. On Halloween I decided to watch the DVD. To my suprise, scenes from the DVD edition had been edited. I thought to myself, why in the world would anyone edit a horror movie from the 1980s? The original theatrical release would easily be considered a light rated R these days. Why edit it?! So, now the movie dull and the scenes that made it worth the cult following have been removed. Please release a DVD of this movie with the original uncut release. Geeze, some executives are so silly."
3,Good Book,"I very much like books by this author, I was somewhat disappointed in this story because it took quite a bit of liberty with bible accounts and I found that this distracted from the overall story which was good."
2,dull,"it's a good story. and i like the fact that we are told the story from Judas' point of view. you get to see the politics surrounding christ and you see that judas isn't evil, just a man, a patriot. but the writing style is boring, slow, and dull."
3,A decent read,This is obviously not Theroux's masterpiece but as usual his characters are well developed and the background interesting and varied. Theroux kept me in suspense until the very end about where this story was going. I liked it!
1,"Expected ""awesome"" -- got ""awful""","The characters were unbelievable, one-dimentional, andshallow. I couldn't have cared less about them. Theroux also managedto create a setting that was equal to the characters--bland and unreal--thereby ensuring that this novel would be a complete disappointment. A pity, too, since the backdrop to this novel (Hong Kong) has such literary promise."
1,Almost Victorian in its ignorance . . .,"Typical Theroux: a splash of acid on some old, rottingtripe. Perhaps the author might consider taking up live targetsinstead of ancient stereotypes when he goes to write the outline of his next novel . . ."
1,"I'd rathter re-read ""THE VETS"" by Stephen Leather!","If compared to what Stephen Leather, a journalist turned novelist stayed in Hong Kong for over 18 years, has delivered in his ""THE VETS"", this book is a complete joke and an insult to the readers with least common sense. Please try 'THE VETS' for a more realistic Hong Kong prior to July 1997. I think that your bad feelings about this book might be justified"
3,A pre-97 Hong Kong thriller,"Set in the year or two just before the British handover, this book really brings back that strange period of a few years when noone knew quite what was going to happen. Would the Chinese move in with their tanks 1 month early just to make a point? Would capitalism in Hong Kong end? Would the progress made under the British be rolled back and the province absorbed into the mother country without trace? Well of course none of that happened (at least not yet).As usual Theroux's characters are vivid and his style matter-of-fact yet very informative. I would have liked a bit of a happier ending but I guess that just reflects the chances of a happy ending for HK at that time. Also the mainland Chinese are portrayed as somewhat pantomime villains. This work doesn't quite stand out like his travel books but still definitely worth reading."
4,Visual Characters,"The fans of Paul Theroux will enjoy this book. Bunt and his mother share the final days of the ""take-away"" of Hong Kong. Their personal lives reflecting the very ominous arrival of the Chinese.. Mr. Theroux does not put the Chinese in a very good light and I hope he does not plan to travel their soon"
1,Racist and with zero basis in fact,"Paul Theroux should really have visited Hong Kong before hefigured on cashing in on the ""handover"". Of course his stockforeigners are shadowy and dangerous. Of course his Chinese women are sweet, submissive and beautiful. Of course! Paul Theroux once again trots out his boring stupid prejudices.Interesting fact missed missed by Theroux during his research through Hong Kong tourist guides- Kowloon Tong is not an industrial area but an exclusive residential zone. There are plenty more of these, fact fans. Mr. Theroux, get yourself together."
5,John Norum rocks!!!!!!!,"I've waited for 14 years to get this CD into my hands, due to the blessing of the web and Amazon, I've finally got it. The first time I listened to it was from a bad recording in a cassette. Then, it was impossible to find it in my country, and finally, got the record. While I'm writing this, I'm listening to it. It is simply excellent. I really recommend it if you're looking for late 80's really well made rock music, in this ages where virtuosism is almost forgotten, John Norum really rocks!!!!!!"
3,Europe's guitarist,"Maybe this is not the greatest album of all time but personally it holds a lot of memories and is a good buy for any musician that likes nice solos, memorable songs ala Yngwie."
3,John Norum doesn't need Europe,"When John Norum left Europe, he was rather disappointed in their direction towards a softer sound in pursuit of another major hit. So, you might expect his first solo effort ""Total control"" to be a hard and heavy album. Maybe, just maybe Norum was slightly harder than his old mates in Europe with their ""Out of this world"" (featuring Norum's replacement Kee Marcello).The best way to describe ""Total control"" is that it's a rather fast and melodic album, and those who like Europe should also find this one interesting. Best songs are ""Let me love you"", ""Love is meant to last forever"", and ""Back on the streets"" (sung by Göran Edman), but the other tracks holds up rather well. Norum has a much rougher voice than Europe's Joey Tempest, and he can clearly stand on his own as a singer, although he got Glenn Hughes to sing most of the songs on the follow up ""Face the truth"".This is a solid melodic hard rock album well worth 3 solid stars!"
3,A strong debut for John Norum.,"John Norum once confessed that his guitar style aims toward the type of explosive,fiery playing that John Sykes delivered on the legendary 1987'Whitesnake' album.This record is full proof of that;also it is no coincidence that he covered a Thin Lizzy classic,'The Wild One',Thin Lizzy and Gary Moore being other easily traceable influences in his musical approach.Yet,while his guitar attack is ferocious,the songs leave something to be desired,givig the impression of material that needed to be further digested and improved.Still,it is a keeper!"
1,Dissapointed,"Quality was good, however, racks did not have rollers. Very dissapointed. I was buying these to slide out. I am returning the racks."
3,Okay,"I grew up during mid-late 80s/ loved every minute of it including Cover Girls/ Expose along with Pebbbles, Salt N'Pepa, and Sweet Sensation's Hooked on you. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the person who said that all 80s music is bad is wrong, very wrong. It is also very close-minded. Kim Wilde's remake of Diana Ross/ The Supreme's keep me hanging on was awesome."
4,"Quite Good, but Incomplete","As many reviews have stated, this compilation of Sheena's hit singles has most but misses who obivious Top 10 hits, ""The Lover In Me"" and ""For Eyes Only."" Even though I would have liked very much to have those songs on this disc, I do like her Top 30 hit single, ""Do It For Love"" and ""When He Shines."" Her rendition of ""Wind Beneathe My Wings"" is so refined vocally and stripped down yet moving in the production of the song. It makes one wonder why this was not the major hit song it deserves to be. Overall, it is a good place to start if you are unfimilar with most of Sheena's songs or if you are a casual fan. If not, I'd suggest getting her individual albums before this compilation."
3,Good but too few,Good but too few songs. She had another greatest hits cd that was much better. I just can't find it new or used.
3,Decent Compilation,"Even though I had a mad crush on Sheena Easton back 20 years ago, this album isn't quite what I was hoping for. Although a few of the tracks were her popular ones, a good number of the tracks could have been omitted, and it would have left the same taste for me. ""Almost Over You"" is one of my favorites, and a few of the other tracks were nice, but the whole compilation was missing something... perhaps more tracks. But, the older compilations usually don't have as many total tracks as the newer ones anyway. If you're looking to buy this used, it might be worth it, but you probably don't want to spend more than a few dollars on this one."
4,As expected,Download went well. Quality of MP3 is fine. Billing was flawless. Love the song or I wouldn't have downloaded it.
3,far too sweet,"this tea doesnt have the beneficial ingredients many of their others do and its just too strong, flavor wise."
5,My favorite tea,"I don't work for Celestial Seasonings. Just thought I'd get that out of the way. Not that anyone else who has left feedback does work for them! I am not implying any such thing! But I do not. I just love this tea. I have found that one tea bag makes one 8 oz. cup of tea. The first thing I notice when I sip CS Vanilla Hazelnut is a nutty flavor I have never experienced with any other. I am not a big tea drinker to begin with, coffee being my drink of choice, but I have at least one cup of Vanilla Hazelnut every evening after dinner and I could not care less if I have dessert to go with it, that's how satisfying I find it to be."
5,Got my family hooked!,"We love this tea... but I will say I hate it when made according to the directions on the box.I bring 4 cups of filtered water to a boil. Drop 1 tea bag in. Turn the heat off. Let steap for about 10 minutes. Bring back to almost a boil, add milk, sugar/stevia, and heat until hot.This method may not be everyone's 'cup of tea', but every guest and family member who has tried it falls in love. I do the same thing with the English Toffee, and Almond Sunset."
5,My favorite tea by this company!,"This tea is not available locally, so I was happy to find it online. I love this made in to iced tea. It has a nice sweet taste without sugar and the hazelnut gives it awesome flavor."
5,Amazing...,"This tea is delicious. I discovered it in my mom's tea cabinet and have been drinking it ever since. I don't use sugar or anything else for it-just the tea bag and the water. I haven't tried it with sugar and I don't intend to because it tastes absolutely wonderful by itself. I don't understand why some of the reviews are negative, but I say before you buy a 6 pack of something you've never tried, go to an actual store and buy ONE. This is a very soothing and relaxing tea, and the tste lingers in your mouth after every sip. Yes, I highly recommend it, but MAKE SURE TO TRY IT WITHOUT CREAMER, MILK, SUGAR, ETC. Those other products probably adulterate the taste."
1,Yuck,"I bought a six pack, thinking that I love normally love any beverage with vanilla and/or hazelnut. This tea doesn't taste anything like hazelnut, and not much like vanilla. It's just gross. I made it twice, and dumped both cups out."
1,A laughingly bad Aquaman book!,"This is almost bad enough that it should be read just to enjoy laughing AT it. The art is Saturday morning cartoon bad and at times worse. Peter David, who is a really good writer, delivers jokingly bad dialogue with plots that Stan Lee would scoff at. Please read something else."
2,Not very interesting,"If you read the Aqua-Man stories of the 1950's and 60's, he was a very dyanmantic character. A young king of the sea who defended his realm from any and all evil. Today Aqua-Man acts very much like Namor; The Sub-Mariner, he hates air breathers, attacks those who pollute the sea, and he can't seem to get his personal life in order. That pretty much desribes these new stories in this volume. Aqua-Man has not been treated well by comic book writers for much of this decade, with him loseing his right arm and becoming more and more of a character that walks the line between right and wrong."
5,inspired reading,I inherited an original 1923 version of this book from my Grandmother. As a young boy the quotes collected by Hubbard inspired my interest in history and literature. It is truly a treasure.. buy it if you enjoy discovering gems of wisdom.
5,Good quotes!,"I appreciated the quick service from chewybooks through Amazon. They even gift-wrapped. This was a book I had liked that my parents had, so I was pleased to find it available since it is old. It is a collection of interesting quotes."
5,An Intimate Experience With Neil Young Live,"The Cd opens to the sound of applause. The first song, ""On The Way Home"" sets the tone for the following 16 songs. Being a huge Neil Young fan, this is the CD you don't want to miss. When he introduces his ""new"" songs like ""Old Man,"" I get chills. Amazing vocals combined with an adoring live audience, makes this an intimate listening experience that is beyond awesome. If I couldn't be there, this is the next best thing. He finishes the set with a humble rendition of, ""I am a Child."" His voice is sweet & sincere and takes me back to another time, the senenties. Also, having my own child now, I found the lyrics particularly profound. If you love Young, you'll love this CD."
5,Neil Young-Live at Massey Hall 1971,This CD is a fine copulation of Neil Young's writing ability & performing talent.Most of his songs are very well known amongst his fans in the music world. A must have CD for your collection.
5,Genius...,"...This is as great as popular music can get. Even if you do not like this artist...believe me, he'll be around long after we ain't. I loved him when I was 13 and 40 odd years later, still do."
5,Comprehensive Help for Those Who Care for Aging Parents,"Virginia Morris nails it with this comprehensive volume. She addresses every issue I've faced as a caregiver and more. Her sensitivity and caring shine through every page, and she's packed the book with useful information.If you're caring for aging parents, start here. ""How to Care for Aging Parents"" stands head and shoulders above other general caregiving books.Phyllis Staff, Ph.D.author, ""How to Find Great Senior Housing""and""128 Ways to Prevent Alzheimer's and Other Dementias"""
5,"If you have an aging parent, you must read this book.","I got this book when my father-in-law was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and it was a tremendous help. It provides very clear, practical ways to deal with problems that arise when your parents become unable to care for themselves. It's compassionate and heard-headed at the same time, so it not only helps you cope with the emotions involved in a difficult situation, it helps you actually resolve the situation in a way that is beneficial for everyone concerned. This is an indispensble guide for anyone who is grappling with how to care for an aging parent. I have given it as a gift to many people and they all say the same thing -- ""I don't know what I would have done without it."""
5,A must-buy for anyone worried about an aged parent!!,"This book has helped me enormously in dealing with my parents. It's easy to look up information, and it provides a lot of support, letting you know that you're not the only one who is going through this. I can't say enough good things about it. I've given it to a dozen friends already!"
3,Watch out! Songs are edited...,"I gave this 5 stars for the content and 1 star for BGO's edition. The two albums are definitely worth buying,... but separately. This version by BGO has the songs edited in order to fit onto one CD. I bought the first album by itself (Repertoire label from Germany) and then this British 2fer version in order to get the 2nd of May at a decent price. Comparing the first album on both CDs, the BGO version fades out the songs early! Not being sure that they did the same with the second album, I immediately returned the BGO version and bought the unedited (albeit expensive) German import of 2nd of May. Yer pays yer money, yer takes yer chances..."
1,"Great band, poor cd","I love this band but there's one thing you have to know before buying this album, they edit the songs down to fit on the cd. Completely cut out the guitar solo on Fire Queen? Great idea...and they did this to several songs. Someone needs to have their @#$ kicked for releasing this as is."
3,Early 70's Cream Like Power Trio,"A somewhat interesting heavy music obscurity when psychedelia still tinged the metal/blues rock/jam band hopefuls. Although released in '70 I first heard it in the early 80's (college days) on an eight track in a friend's battered and barely running 1966 Ford Econoline van. I think that spring ""Smoking The Day Away"" (basically what we did) was like the theme song for my group of friends. That cut along with ""Fire Queen"" and ""Squeet"" are memorable. I have the first album on vinyl and don't own Second Of May, so I can't comment on that portion,but I'm sure the ""two on one"" is a good value. The first album is very psych and more than a little uneven like the Amboy Dukes in the same period."
5,Keeps your computer running fast and error free!,"I've been buying each edition since 2003 and I can't sing their praises highly enough. They keep my computer working so fast. Sure, you can defrag with Windows, but with System Works you can also optimize. And the WinDoctor and Disk Doctor have gotten me out of so many problems, I can't even count. This software package is a God-send! You should seriously consider installing both it and Norton Internet Security 2006 for optimum preformance and protection!"
2,Who wants just snippets of these hymns?,"If a hymn is your ""favorite"" why would you want to hear only a small part of it?!Sheesh! If you actually like these hymns (and they are good ones) look elsewhere for an unabridged version!"
4,Not perfect but nice.,"The orchestration is lush and sounds real (no string machine, not keyboards, not computers). The choir sounds full but the lower voices could be a bit louder - a problem with a lot of choirs.The songs are all sacred classics and despite the fact they have been shortened, they're still uplifting and awesome.Compared to a lot of hymn CDs, I've listented to or sampled, this one is great. I'd recommend it to anyone."
4,31 Classic Hymns,I am a lover of great Classic Hymns of the faith and find the information given to be enought for me to be interested in obtaining copies of same.
1,Beware of this CD,"I wish I had read the other reviews (I'm not even sure if they were there, though) before I bought this CD, and now I can't return it because its been opened. As others have said, there are about 2 versus from each hymn, before going on to the next hymn. This is indeed a ""medley"" CD, not a full CD."
1,Plastic Parts,"I agree with the other review. This can is handy and looks pretty good, but the plastic pieces on the bottom are ... trash. Both of mine broke and I'm stuck with this stainless trash. Avoid this trashcan!"
1,"Nice looking, but bad quality",This can makes me very disappointed. One of the plastic pieces on the movable cover was broken after two months of use. The plastic pieces at the bottom did not last longer: they were not functioning well within the first year. Avoid this trashcan!
1,"Cool concept, poor execution!","I had this garbage can, and like the 1st reviewer, the plastic clips that held the foot bar down broke CONSTANTLY! I contacted Hailo USA, and the gentleman there sent me a bunch of replacement clips. I finally ran out of clips, gave up, and got a different can altogether.For the money, which seemed high for a garbage can, it isn't worth it."
5,"good product,had mine a LONG time","I bought one of these 21 years ago(it was painted yellow and white and called sea explorer back then)and it still works today.I dont use it very often but it definatly is a good product,does as advertised and will dive deeper than the antena length.I have used it in ponds but a swimming pool is safer,mine has been in the family so long I would be upset to lose it in the bottom of a pond."
1,Submarine way over priced and still not worth it,I got either the this item or a very similar one at Walmart for 20 bucks. At either price the design is too fragile and not worth it. Dived okay - but was next to impossible to balance bouyancy and control - plus the deeper you went the bouyancy would change and just was more a pain after the first few minutes than it was worth....
1,The Sea Wolf Is Cheasy,The Sea Wolf is very cheasy because it has a very high price.Plus I don't think it is fast diving.Don't buy this submarine.It is a piece of junk.
2,Not Really About Corals,"Having used Tullock's ""Reef Aquarium"" book extensively, I expected this book to focus on corals specifically. Instead it spends an inordinate amount of time on water conditions, lighting, and other ""generic"" marine aquarium topics. In fact, only the last 1/4 of the book actually focuses on corals. While the book is helpful and certainly Tullock's knowledge is extensive, the book falls short of its title and ranks poorly compared to other books dedicated to the care of Corals."
5,Great B Sides.,"Who would've ever thought System would cover a Berlin song? It's done rather well (of course) as is their version of Sabbaths ""Snowblind"". And the collaboration with Wu-Tang is great, do a search for the lyrics. The final song ""Marmalade"" is classic System. There's also a video for ""Lonely Day"". If you're a fan, it's worth the money."
3,Some solace,Fun EP touching on the groups particular brand of menacing melodies before generally succumbing to the cultured thrash.
1,Lonely day is the low point,"I'm going to have to say that ""Lonely Day"" is the absolute worst system of a down song ever. The covers are good and fun but I don't see anything redeemable about the song itself. Pure mainstream garbage."
5,Sprague Bros. Rule,This CD is a must have for all Sprague Brothers fans. It goes from old stuff to new(er) stuff. I just hope these two get back together again.
2,disappointed,Through no fault of amazon this DVD came up short in Christmas sights and the sounds could have been better. Maybe I was exspecting to much ? I didn't play it at all during the holidays.If I paid alot less then I did I would have still been disappointed. Sorry ! My Fault and no one else.
2,Kind of weird,"This DVD is a little strange at times. It's cute enough considering I bought it USED for around $2. But if you're going to have to pay much more than that...don't. Some parts are cute, some are just wierd looking."
5,A CLASSIC !,A rich repertoire of beautiful Christmas music with various and numerous scenes of holiday symbols and events. I play this one all year long - very peaceful. A true classic.
1,Doctor Who: The Macra Terror,"Few of these Doctor Who novelisations can be called litery masterpieces , in fact some of them are just downright bad , but for me THE MACRA TERROR is almost certainly the worst of the whole range. What`s wrong with it ? Allegedly the televised story the novel is adapted from is "" a classic "" , but reading this bland novelisation left me underwhelmed . It lacks anything resembling atmosphere or charachterisation. In fact it`s just like reading a script with a few brief visual descriptions thrown in. I know the Target series of Doctor Who novelisations are aimed at children but that`s no excuse for not thrilling the reader. Tedious in the extreme"
5,this is a must have masterpiece,"i was 10 years old when my father bought this on 8-track. i enjoyed it then and i still do. if my house caught on fire, this is one of the cd i will try to save."
2,Disappointed,"I'm wondering why if I order two CD's from two different vendors, One in California and the other in Florida. With me living in FLORIDA the one from California came first. I just need an explanation when ordering at the same time why is it taking soooooooooo long to get my item from one part of Florida to the other part.Inquiring minds wanna knowOrdered August 10,California arrival to Florida August 20thFlorida arrival don't know still waiting for shipment confirmation"
3,"Love Dave Barry, but this isn't his best work","Maybe it's because much of this book was written about events from the 80s and 90s, or maybe I'm just getting older, but I didn't laugh out loud as much at this book as I usually do at Dave Barry's books. There were some notable essays that did get me snickering, and the whole book was enjoyable, but I didn't get that stitch in my side that I have from reading some of his other work. I found his novels (Big Trouble, Tricky Business) very funny, and some of his other column collections, too. Don't make this the only Dave Barry book you read."
2,"Huge Pepper fan, not a fan of No Shame","Before the relaease of this CD it was described as ""Kona Town on steroids"" after listening, this cd is Kona Town on estrogen!I'm a huge pepper fan, own everything that they've released(including DVD's), and have seen them live numerous times. This CD just doesn't do it for me. It is very soft and lyrically weak, girls will probably love it and it will sell but it is not their best. No Cntrol is probably the best song on here; Green Hell and Zicky's song are also very good. Good enough opens with some very promising riffs but lyrically turns into the common ""soft"" theme of the rest of the cd. The rest are pretty much weak filler and are worth no more than a listen to figure that out. I'm not sure if it was Atlantic records that caused this or what but I hope they can rebound very soon with some new material."
2,"Please, just cover Sublime","I apologize for the lack of thoroughness in the review of this record, but I am begging, please, Pepper, just cover Sublime. I like you guys, I like some of the songs on this record and you are fun in concert, but I can't help myself continually feel like that the band should just cover Sublime. Pepper writes some good songs and I can't complain about any of it (drop it at a party on any given summer day and people will all be smiling and grooving with it), but Sublime wrote better songs and the sound of this band is not different enough for me to actually label them anything other than a wanna-be Sublime band.Sorry. Show some growth or just cover Sublime. 2 and a half stars overall since this album is unoffensive and fun, but it is far from standout."
4,Immovable Objects,"Getting past the images of the previous ""review"", This book is part of the ""Family Secrets"" series from Silhouette. Here is part of the burb from the back cover.'Subject: Telekinetic Elizabeth.......Relishing her newfound freedom from a donineering brother, Elizabeth wants to only control her destiny, her power, her heart. Like a bird set loose she test her wings....and so she finds here billionaire ...has trouble from some one from her past.Tag line is ""No One is Alone"". Not the strongest story in the series but it does move the series along."
3,"Bad fit, but for price decent enough","I got one of these for the 2007-08 Honda Fit. The box says that is what I got, but the fit on the dash is pretty bad. It is clearly slightly too wide and can't ever be smoothed out all the way because of this. The reason I got it was to keep the car a bit cooler and reduce reflections, and it does that fine, but it is far from perfect. I give it a grudging 3 stars, as there is really no excuse for it to fit so poorly given that it supposedly matches my exact car model and year.P.S. I inherited one of these from the same company with a purchase of a 2001 Honda Insight (the real Insight, not the new huge one) and it fit excellently and was of a better quality. That one was from the original owner, and it is now about 10 years old and is still in great condition."
4,Olu's book review,Katie Morag and the Big Boy Cousins is a good book. It shows that you do not have to be bad to be cool. She was being bad to impress her big cousins. I also like the illustrations.
4,Decent intake.,"I've had this installed for about 6 months now, and it has a noticeable change in engine sound and power above 3000 rpm. The filter vibrates against the heat shield below 2000 rpms when I'm lugging up hills or up my steep driveway which is why I am only giving it 4 stars. I've tried re-positioning the hose clamps slightly and adjusting the filter around but I still gets a vibration that is very noticeable. It is still a great system though. I would buy it again."
3,They are okay,"Just opened the box and found the well sized and weighted plastic pins. However, the red stickers around the neck were coming off and the set does NOT come with a ball. I should not have assumed that it would come with a ball but I did and am disappointed that it does not. Still, my kids will have fun knocking down the pins with a random ball from the house.Don't think we will use the poster-board set up triangle. It will probably get ripped anyway."
4,"Fun, Cool, Comfy!!","Very comfy pair of shoes! Super lightweight, cool-looking ... and true to size. Good buy!"
2,fyfed22,"""Revival"" is excellent. The title song is also very good but, that's about it. There just wasn't enough variation in the rest of the album other than track 4 but I didn't really care for that one."
1,completely pointless for our 10 month old,"Maybe our daughter is too young to use this product as intended. As soon as we gave it to her, she understood how to reach in to retrieve a snack, but she quickly learned to completely remove the top. Ultimately, fun won out over hunger and she either held down one of the flaps and then shook the container; thereby releasing all contents onto the floor and her lap; OR she just removed the top and dumped the contents onto the floor and her lap. We gave it to our neighbors and their 15-month old is able to use the snack catcher just fine. It's possible that our daughter will grow into being able to use this, but I'm not entirely convinced. Why is it so easy to pull the top off? A screw top instead of a pull on/off lid would be more appropriate, I think."
2,Getting Cuts from the Cover,"I purchased the snack catcher after having weighed the pros and cons from the product reviews. Upon using it, I initially thought it well-made and durable, despite the inevitable falling out of a few Cheerios whenever my 21mo toddler would use it. And she loved eating out of this cup. After a few weeks, however, I noticed several red scratch marks on her hand - the same hand that she uses to take the snack out of the cup! I inspected her for a couple of days and decided to chuck the cover. I still use the cup part because we like the handle. Although there's a lot of spillage without the cover, it's better than the cuts she's gotten. I wish Munchkin would redesign the cover to make it safer."
2,"Expensive, misleading","Call me ditzy for not realizing that there was only one in the package, but the picture shows 2. I should have read the fine print, but I felt this was a little misleading.And, $8 for 1???? If I had realized there was only one, I never would have bought it. And, I definitely wouldn't have bought it for a 2-year old that is smart and immediately knew how to get the lid off and dump his snacks everywhere!"
4,snack catchers,The product has met my expectations of lessening snack spills. It is designed very well and is priced reasonably.
3,Love the design BUT needs a lid,These are great & my son loves them but they really needed to design a lid to use with them....they dump out in my purse so I have to put the snacks in a baggie and then transfer them to the cup when my son is ready for them. This cup does keep him busy for a while (especially when were in a store & I need him to keep quite for a bit).
3,Handy cup,Very handy cup... Although I wish it had an actual cover as well so that you can use it to store snacks longer & my 1 year old makes a mess with it because she can't pull out only 1 snack at a time. I assume that will get better the older she gets.
2,Photo is misleading,"While this may be a really good product (don't know, haven't tried it yet), I placed my order expecting to receive 2 snack cups since the picture shows 2. I was surprised when I received my order to learn that there was only one. Had I known this, I would have ordered from a different company that offered a second snack cup for 60 cents more than I paid for this one. I am very disappointed in Amazon that they supplied a photo which is misleading to the consumer."
1,Another poor quality product from munckin,"This is the third munchkin product I've purchased in the last six months and they've all ended up in the trash or recycled or repurposed. This cup is a great idea, but was poorly executed. The plastic lid comes right off with barely a tug. It practically fell off twice while I was just holding it after getting the packaging off. I didn't even bother trying to use it as my son would have the lid off in seconds. I didn't buy this on amazon and don't have the receipt so we'll use the cup later when my son is older or for other things... Too bad. I would NOT recommend this brand or this product to anyone."
4,Thanks,Bought for game night and wife and friends enjoys it... aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!!
4,Adult Game Night Must!,"This is great for an adult game night. We were worried it might be too risque for some, but it's mild enough for anyone we may have over!"
5,Try this game with the clock ticking!,"When the drinks are flowing and eveyone is having an adult good time we play this game, then we introduced the Countdown Clock Timer and wow! now things got even more fun, especially when you are under the time gun!VJWorld Visuals Countdown Clock Timer"
4,Great for Girls Weekend!,"This game was lots of fun for the girls weekend. It is a truth or dare style game with lots of room for drinking! Many of the spaces are take a drink, all drink, take a shot, or draw an I've never card. Lots of fun and you will find out more than you wanted to know about the other players!"
