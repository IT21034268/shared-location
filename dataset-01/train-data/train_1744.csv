2,Dark and boring,"I don't get it. I really don't. I like to think of myself as being open-minded to music in all forms -- indie punk, hardcore, underground hip-hop. But minute after minute of atmospheric noise -- this is all wrong. Just wrong.""Human Animal"" is an evil, evil record, and I need to get it out of my house before something terrible happens.Somebody out there will like it. Anybody wanna buy my copy?"
3,Decent little book,"It's a pretty good little guide to an amazing church, but it's absolutely full of typos. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the church, but can't give it a higher review because it just doesn't look like anyone read over it before it went to print."
4,"Whimsical, endearing tale of small-town life, c.1900s.","Situated in Tory, a small town in Central Illinois, Smith's whimsical tales resemble the recently popular Jan Karon. Seen through the eyes of Helene, the young daughter of the village doctor, Tory is a gentle and naiive, though not completely innocent turn of the century small town. Smith was about 65 when she wrote this, her first novel, and died shortly after it was published. If you enjoy the delightful and endearing novels of Jan Karon's Mitford series, you will love Madeline Babcock Smith's ""The Lemon Jelly Cake."""
5,Sweet & thoughtful..,"The book is such a fresh faced look on life - it makes one feel they are eleven years old and living the simple (and sometimes, not so simple) life of summer in a small town. Reading this book just calms one down, and makes one appreciate the simple things in life. It's a real gem of a story, with lots of humor associated with an eleven year olds interpretation of some very adult situations. I heartily recommend this book to anyone, and its a Christmas gift to a lot of people I know."
5,Delightful romp.,"Turn of last century, small town in Illinois tale told through the eyes of one of two of the most well known eleven year old girls in town. ( One is the Doctor's daughter, the other is the ministers daughter.) They know the dirt in town, yet are humorously innocent as well.It is like stepping back in time, via a Disney production, and only being delighted and entertained.Light fare for traveling back to a gentler time."
4,Sweet and ever-so-slightly tongue-in-cheek,"This seemingly innocent reminiscense of the last millennium (1900) is really a droll and cleverly-crafted look at the foibles and follies of small-town America. Madeline Babcock Smith had a lot to say between the lines, although her charming tale can probably stand being taken at face value."
1,Political by Omission,"How can you have a Lullaby CD from 'Around The World' and omitGermany as the country of origin for the All Time Classic Lullaby""Guten Abend, gute Nacht"" !??"
5,An enchanting mixture of culture and sounds for the soul.,"This compilation of lullabies from around the world allows one to see the common threads of love, fear, and hope every parent has. Although we may be different in language and musical style we all realize the same elation and apprehension when children are brought into our lives.This selection of lullabies is colorful, rich, warm, and captivating. Highly recommended!"
4,Very good,"Made Out of Babies is a female fronted rock/metal group from Brooklyn who might draw comparisons to the Melvins, Helmet, Unsane and the Jesus Lizard. They have a very early 90's vibe going for them that works really well. Julie, their frontwoman, in addition to being very sexy and attractive, is a powerhouse vocalist with a literally INSANE vocal style. She can scream, she can sing and she does just about everything in between. On Swarm she squeals like the actress who played the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz before launching into an impressive roar followed by some wailing stoner rock vocals. The guitar riffing is impressive too. I highly recommend this band."
5,Just a little note,"I think you should definetly get this album. The metal and hard rock music they play is LOUD, even if your sound is turned to one. You can hear Julie's voice EXPLODING around the studio. I know Julie, and so I got their album free. I said one day, ""eh, might as well pop this in"" and I was completely blown away. I feel lucky to know her as a person and not as a star (I knew her before MoOB came along) BUY THIS NOW!"
3,A moral boxing movie.,"This is a movie for boxing fans who want thier monies worth. It stars Tim Conway as a bumbling boxer who really hasn't made a name for himself, and Don Knotts as his manager. The jokes are flat here, and it seems more serious than a comedy. However, it does make up for itself with showing a moral boxer. In the movie Conway is set up with other bum boxers like himself, and he beats them all, and then he gets the golden opprtunity to take on the boxing champion in his weight catagory. Here Knotts gets mixed up with some shady characters in which Knotts and Conway can stand to make alot of money if Conway throws the fight. However, when Conway learns of this something snaps within him, and he goes out there with all he has, and ends up winning the bout. It's Disney fare no doubt, and it wasn't even put out by Disney, but just about average."
1,SkyKing,"Tim Conway and Don Knotts are the funniest of all comedians. This early movie is not funny. I couldn't stay with it long enough to see if it improved after about 15 minutes of viewing. Perhaps a collector would want it, I didn't find it worth viewing."
4,Seems to work,"I paint my nails a lot, and hate risking smudging them during the long drying time. I bought this spray and it seems to help shorten that process some. It does not dry instantly or super quickly, but it does have a pleasant smell and any time off is fine with me. I will probably buy again when my bottle runs out."
2,Did not work for me,"i think i just got a bad bottle because i have heard great things about this and seen the great reviews. but it did not work for me. left nails oily, polish gummy, and bubbles formed on top. Will purchase again to find out the truth!"
1,Does not work!,It does not dry the polish! I've odered 3 and these are total waste of money. i am so dispointed with OPI.
2,Fashion flapper dress,Great quality costume but ordered size bigger and it still wasnt the right size was extremely skin tight.
5,Love it!,"Very cute dress, it will be perfect for the party I'm going to. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it looked. Amazing how it hides those imperfections you don't want anyone seeing."
4,"Very cute, but a little too long","I teach young children and this is a very simple, cute book about winter clothing with the structure of ""The House that Jack Built,"" i.e., cumulative, adding an item of clothing on each page with a picture, rebus-style. As one reviewer noted, this can get tedious to read aloud to a group. However, I generally like it and the illustrations are nice, simple and sweet."
4,Unknown R & J,"Shakespeare can be pretty hard to understand, but this version was easy to watch, and I even understood it! I have read the play and seen the other movie versions and I like this one because it covers all the important stuff. The actors playing Romeo and Juliet seem too old for their parts, yet play them very well."
5,Incredible! But the music's a tad loud...,"I thought the way they used symbolism in this movie was incredible! The most obvious was the water, which some people hated, but I thought it was very emotionally pulling. Leonardo DiCaprio is, dare I say it, one of the best, if not THE best actor of my generation. He stays true to his reputation in the modernization of this classic. We have to remember that when Shakespeare used this language, the phrases were not cliches, as they are now. Leonardo and Claire Danes display the freshness and vitality that the words originally had. I do have to say, however, that the music is so loud at some points, you can hardly hear the words. All around it's an excellent piece. END"
5,Orff Rocks!,"Joel Orff is one of the most under-rated cats in comix these days. This book is a collection of as-told-to tales of everyday people's connection with the ethereal power which is music, or sometimes just the plain old rockandrollness of life. THE BEST BOOK ABOUT ROCK AND ROLL NOT WRITTEN BY NICK TOSCHES!"
4,Interesting.,"The second installment of the bubblegum crisis series cranks up the heat. First up Genom the evil corporation uses the A.D police to try to capture the Knight Sabers, when Priss, Lina and Nene get trapped Sylia is forced to suit up to rescue her allies. Also a mysterious young boy named Mackey shows up, Sylia claims its her brother but she's obviously lying. Meanwhile Leon tries to flirt with Priss and just comes off as smarmy. Also Priss resents Mackys friendship with Nigel. I like the fact that the characters aren't a bunch of goody two shoes, in particular Sylia she has good intentions but she has an explosive temper and can be very moody, but it's obvious she's a good person. Personally i'm okay with watching the episodes in their english versions,except for FIREBALL which focuses a lot on Priss and her horrible nonsensical singing, so put in the ear plugs!! The DvD has 4 great action packed episodes which is very reasonable. EP"
1,WRONG DVD!!!,"The idiot gave me the wrong DVD! I got the cover, but not the DVD! How could he not know the right DVD?!"
5,The characters grow on you the more you watch!,"In my review on Volume 1: Genesis, I noted that I was disappointed with the way the re-make portrayed the characters as compared with the original. However, I must say that Volume 2: Crusade, is MUCH BETTER because the characters are beginning to have similar traits as their original counterparts. I'm also very pleased that they brought Mackie back (Sylia's brother), although he hasn't shown his perverted side yet. The storyline is good and the soundtrack still rocks! All in all, I'm very happy with Crusade and I'm now looking forward to the remaining episodes. If you saw Genesis and are ready to give up on the girls, don't because the more you watch, the more they start to grow on you! BUBBLEGUM CRISIS IS BACK!"
3,"Oops! Wrong ""Flamenco Chill"" ...","This is nice flamenco muzak.I meant to buy Chambao's first album, by the same title. A much different thing.You will like this if like the sound of flamenco guitar played in a very mellow way.All-in-all, not too very bad an accident, since this could make some good mood music to sleep by, or maybe if I'm feeling tense and want something in the background to help me relax."
5,Helped me get my credit,"I studied this and the CLEP Official Study Guide (extra tests) like crazy and got an A on my marketing CLEP. I highly recommend this brand for CLEP exams. I also would get the official study guide, it just has tests in it, not subject matter like this one - but this one has only two tests, and I wanted more to study with."
5,Minimal Effort For Passing The CLEP,"I read through this once and went through 15 of the practice questions... after I got them all right I stopped trying and took the test. I did well and passed easily, this book had more than enough info to get me a decent score on the test.Two things to note:1. 2/3 of this book is made up of practice tests... the study materials themselves are well under 100 pages.2. I'm actually kind of good in marketing and work part-time in PPC Advertising... so if you are completely new to marketing please prep a little more than I did so you can ensure a passing grade on the CLEP."
2,"Good, But Not Good Enough","This book is fine in order to prepare you for what type of questions will be on the exam, but I strongly recommend using another source such as a marketing college textbook. Although I passed the exam, there were a lot of questions on the exam that was not in this book."
1,Very disappointed,I thought I was buying another book that received rather decent reviews here at amazon.com. I made the mistake of not buying it here put relied on my memory at the local bookstore. The book states the examples are on the CD but I could not find them anywhere. I guess I could open all the zip files and hope for the best. I found so many error in chapter 2. I am going to give up on this book soon. Since I program for a living and have a Java XML book with examples I can play with the stylesheet examples in the book until it works as discussed in the text. This is a very frustrating way to learn. I even went to w3c to get the recommendation for help. I buy books to avoid this headache. I do not recommend this book. There are other books on the same topic with better reviews that I intend to purchase instead of this paper weight.
4,Necessary,"The Fruit of Your Pain by Laverne Hanes-Stevens, PH.D is a necessary tool for anyone who wants to mature in their Christian walk. First, it helps one to accept the fact that there ""will"" be -not ""might"" be - seasons of struggle and pain in our lives. But, as the book explains, we can do more than simply accept that fact, we can actually be fruitful and grow as a result of our struggles. The 31 Meditations for Growing Kingdom Fruit exercises at the end of the book are especially helpful because it helps you to actually ""develop"" the fruit in your life."
2,mildly entertaining for young children,"This movie is mildly entertaining for young children, but adults will notice the low budget quality. The acting is mediocre, the lines are weak and often anachronistic in the scenes set in 1948. Although it is of relatively low quality, it is a movie you can watch with your kids. The worst part was when Julietta's father sends her to a ""mad scientist's"" house/lab alone. I don't think any father in his right mind would send their daughter to a place like that alone, even in 1948."
3,Nice but...,"There is no hole for the speaker so it's muffled. The tolerance around the USB port and headphone jack is to close and the plugs will not seat far enough to work; same problem when the phone is reversed for the stand. The stand consists of a wire loop underneath the belt loop catch to prop it open and is pretty stable on a hard, flat surface; maximum prop angle is approximately 30 degrees. I'm going to keep it and modify with a drill & file because the stand is needed to keep the speaker in the air and also helps the antenna."
2,Not a keeper,This movie had potential to become a good scifi flick. Instead as the movie plot went on it became worse & worse. Bad enough for me to shut it off. The movie is in the pile of dvds to be traded in. Not a keeper for my collection.
4,a great guide for photographers,"This is a great guidebook for photographers because it presents at least one photo of each potential destination. So you can get a pretty good idea whether it is worth venturing out from your hotel. The guide is compact and perfect for a one-week trip to Israel. I used it when on business there and had a few extra days to prepare a photo exhibit for photo.net. If I were staying a month I'd probably want something thicker. Students on a budget will want to supplement this with a ""How to get around cheaply"" guide like the Lonely Planet or Lets Go."
5,Jerusalem and the Holy Land,"We had an occasion to visit Jerusalem and Bethlehem last October on a whirlwind day tour. I took many pictures and did not know where I had taken them or why. This very excellent book cleared up a lot of these questions as well as many other things which we saw and did not remember until looking at the book. It is a very comprehensive, complete travel guide with beautiful pictures and lots of good information. By the way the price was unbelievably low for such a valuable book."
4,Pucci,"Have always wantd to own a Pucci garment: this is my first and I am a big fan of this one-piece swimsuit made affordable through Amazon. However, as with all European designer products, beware European cuts!! I usually wear European size 36 and deliberately ordered it 2 sizes larger. The suit fits, but nevertheless reveals much more flesh across the backside than I am accustomed to . . . don't buy this suit if you are shy! Between the fabulous pattern and skimpy cut, it's made to turn heads at the beach/pool."
2,Better than the first but still REALLY bad!,"I'm gonna make this short. There is no reason to buy this. It is a Jaws rip off! They coppied almost half of this movie from Jaws. They even use the line ""Out of the water,get out of the water now""! How cheap is that! The graphics are horrible and the shark modals look like cheap blow up toys! The acting is okay but compared to Jaws's acting it sounds like Roseanne Barr singing ""My Heart Will Go On""! Yep. Well you get the point.Buy Jaws or Deep Blue Sea insted."
1,Worst Jaws spin-off ever!,"- Faked shark effects, bad acting, ""Jaws"" recycled music... I'm the kind of person who can watch b-movies and enjoy them. But, this... I dont know where to start. Anyone who write good reviews and gives the movie five stars, desirves to have their VCR and DVD players trashed! At least the movie has some cool murder scenes. Other than this, it aint worth your cash."
2,good effects bad script......,I had to say Shark Attack 1 was a better film and there was only 3 things i liked about this film-1. Good special effects2. I didnt have to see the first one.3. People acually have graphic deaths {Not deaths that are like cgi graphics}I'd get watch this movie if i had to kill some time. Thats all i could say.
4,Shark Attack 2,Whoever said this was terrible was wrong! If you like these kinds of movies then you'll like this one. Thornston Kaye{from abc's All My Childern} is great. And the Shark well this time its sharks!
2,Shark Attack 2: Attack of the stock footage and CGI Sharks!,"Shark Attack 2 is the name of this film. It's about a guy named Dr. Nick Harris that tries to stop a school of mutant great white sharks, along with Samantha Peterson, a diver, and Roy Bishop, an Austrailian TV show host. This movie is probaly the worst shark movie I have ever seen! The whole movie has only CGI sharks and stock footage! Yeesh!!! Anyway, I guess the shark attacks are OK. But it is still a lame movie!!!"
2,skip this one and don't hesitate to do so,"this film is an absolute disgrace. Come on now what is it with you people trying to rip off jaws like this. For god sakes quit it and make a good shark movie for once. The sharks look totally unconvincing and unscary. They appear to be nothing more than fiberglass. The shark footages are nice but set for the locations,climate and weather. This is not very good. What saves this movie from sinking is the performance by that guy who plays the Aussie. He was good but believe me watching this movie isn't worth watching his good acting my dear friends"
4,Not As Good As The First One.,"Shark attack 2 is not as good,but the sharks look more real. I will name out some of the flaws: 1. the sharks growl. 2.some of the acting was bad. 3. The sharks tails don't move at all that i can see. Well,if you like shark movies then this is the movie for You!"
1,Plastic sharks. Horrible flick,"This was so stupid. Intelligent sharks that swim in schools terrorize alocal tourist beach community. Complete with direct rip-0ffs from""Jaws,"" and combined footage of real sharks with plastic and inflatabletoy sharks. Also the shark thinks it's a lion as it growls before andduring attacks. People underwater with scuba gear can talk, and screameasily too..Hmmmm..LOL..If you like bad films, you might wanna see howstupid and cheap this is. There is plenty nof unintentional humor here. But I cannot give it any better than 1 star. Because that's what it is. A one star mega low budget film. Bad actors. Bad script. Bad director. Bad special effects. But if you hate bad movies, stay away...Truly for lovers of below ""B"" grade films only."
5,I've never seen Jaws...,"and never plan to. I hate shark movies, period, and find their appeal a very juvenile one. To me this was about heroism and romance. Who cares about some cheesy animatronic sharks filmed in a swimming pool and some fake blood - not me. I was completely satisfied because Nick Harris was a real hero, and that's what I wanted to see. I wish they'd make a Shark Attack 3, featuring him."
1,spleen splitting fun,"jese man, talk about b movie magic. ive never cared so much about a man's(whoever the director is) broken dream to make a movie. it is so poorly done, they even let footage of a dolphin substitute for a shark. god bless america!"
5,3rd try is a charm ...,"I've tried two other replacement batteries for my Panasonic phone, and this is the first that seems to have capacity similar to the original battery. The phone now lasts as long as it did originally. With both other replacements I purchased, it lasted less than half as long on a charge. Stay away from NiCd replacements. Stay away from the lower capacity replacements. You will be wasting your money. As a side benefit, this was actually cheaper than both others that I tried. We've had this for about 6 weeks, so I can't attest to how long it will hold up. But so far, it's working great."
2,"below average, but not terrible","I agree with most the reviewers. This book was clearly written for other professors and advanced statisticians and definetely not students. If you get assigned this book for an introductory statistics class, buy or check out other books from the library.On the other hand, this book is not totally worthless. If you are well versed in statistics and have had several advanced classes, this book serves as an actually decent review manual.Overall, in retrospect it was worth the buy. However, I am amazed by the number of professors who actually think this book is adequate for an introductory statistics class. (The typical professor retort ""the authors are respected in the field and have published prolifically"" doesn't really mean a lot in the real world, where people are more interested in learning and not really impressed by the number of publications a professor has)."
4,"Explanative / helpful, yet not much used","This is a decent book, with many helpful explanations and examples, but I actually never need it except for the table of z-scores in the back, because my instructor provides all the necessary notes in class."
1,One of the worst textbooks ever,"This is one of the worst textbooks I've ever bought. It is written in a way that makes the concepts seem harder than they actually are, and does not really describe the equations and their use. It just gives you a bunch of problems that do not always correlate with or are not explained in the chapter."
5,Solid!,"One of the many issues that comes with learning the Rorschach is interpretation and formulating these hypotheses into language that your patient/non psychology professionals will understand. The Exner books are great for gaining a basic understanding of how to code and score. However, its Weiner that really does a nice job bringing the data together in a meaningful way. Additionally, I enjoy Weiner's writing style- its easy to read and provides many examples to fill out the theoretical points. Lastly, I am a fan of the psychodynamic approach he takes, but, at times, I think he reaches a bit far with his interpretations. All in all its a very helpful reference. I would also recommend Weiner and Greene's The Handbook of Personality Assessment- it presents a range of instruments from self report to projective."
3,Chairs,"The chairs are great, however, I would not deal with this company again. Two chairs came right away and were complete. The other two chairs did not have the legs with them. After numerous complaints and a couple of months, the other legs were finally delivered. None of the chairs had hole in the bottom so they needed to be drilled before the legs could be attached to the seat."
4,Awesome!,"These chairs are gorgeous!! They are comfortable and look awesome in my CocaCola Kitchen.The directions on how to put them together do suck in a way, but it is to figure it out once you put one of them together wrong to begin with. lol."
3,"Comfy & cute, but assembly is a bad joke","Everything that the first reviewer of this product said is true (no pre-drilled seats, assembly is unique every time). I ordered a pair of these chairs and they're working out wonderfullly...but it took multiple, frustrating hours to get there. My seats lacked any directions for assembly, so, there was some redo work involved. Also, if you're not comfortable drilling (read: you will need a drill) your own holes for the seat pads...stay away.The assembled chairs are comfortable for what they are. They look very cute and they should hold up for a few years.The simple inclusion of assembly instructions would bump my review up by a star. As it stands, I can't rate semi-tricky, DIY furniture (without instructions) any higher than three stars."
4,"Good but a few issues, and horrid directions","First and foremost the directions are written in broken English. Secondly like an idiot I had mixed up the legs on the chairs and put two left and two right on the chairs... I also used the screws for the bigger and vice versa and had to re-do pieces. So take it slow, and make sure the small screws go in the metal while the longer ones go in the back to hold the headrest. As for the drilling of the seat, that was most likely the easiest part. I put my weight into it while someone held the cushion and bam.They look nice, they match excellent, and they seem to be decent quality. A little longer than expected with the assembly but good otherwise."
1,Never Showerdoordirect again,I have purchased many items through Amazon in the past and my experience has been very good. Until now. The product is a good one. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. What I will NEVER do again is buy from Showerdoordirect. The drawing of the product accompanying the ad looked nothing like what I received. We immediately reordered a larger size for much more $$$ and asked for a Return Authorization. We paid to ship this item back to Showerdoordirect. We received 80% of the purchase price back and upon inquiring was told there was a 20% restocking fee (approximately $50). This was a first. Enough said. Don't go with this company. Customer service is nonexistent
4,neglected Islamic masterpiece,The Awakening of the Soul is another in a long line of esoteric titles from the Kessinger Publishing Company. It is a fine example of Islamic literature. Ibn Tufail was a Moorish writer from the 12th Century. He was born in Andalucia and died in Morrocco. This is his most substantial work. This is a sadly neglected masterpiece. It deals with the spiritual evolution of a man isolated from civilization. Hayy is nurtured by a roe and has to learn to fend for himself as he grows older. He evolves deep spiritual ideas in spite his lack of speech or language. Fate intervenes and Asal happens by his island. Asal is on a spiritual quest of his own. He teaches Hayy language and speech and takes him back to society to attempt to elevate the masses. Anyone interested in Arabic or Islamic literature or in general spirituality should give this book a read. It is well worth the effort.
4,Great Book for B-way Style Tenors- Touching & Fun Songs!,"Although the ranges are specifically for tenors, these songs can be enjoyed by all! Some standouts are Alone at a Drive in Movie (Grease), A Bit of Earth (The Secret Garden), I Believe in You (How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying), I Only Want to Say (Jesus Christ Superstar), Miracle of Miracles (Fiddler on the Roof), She Loves Me (She Loves Me), Sit Down You're Rocking The Boat (Guys and Dolls), This is the Moment (Jekyll and Hyde), Why God Why? (Miss Saigon), and Winter's on the Wing (The Secret Garden). All in all, these are a bunch of fantastic selections that will show off a singer's vocal range as well as technique."
3,Enjoyable light reading - similar to Victoria Holt without the gothic,"Silver Falcon was the first Evelyn Anthony I read years ago, and I enjoyed picking it up again recently. If you enjoy Victoria Holt's gothic romances, you probably would enjoy this non-gothic romance set in the world of horse racing. This is definitely light reading, ideal for the beach, a winter evening at home, travel or jury duty! It's the story of a young woman married to a much older man who owns racehorses, including Silver Falcon of the title, and has some mysterious secrets in his past. When something happens to him, she becomes caught up in an intrigue with far-reaching implications. Evelyn Anthony's characterizations and sense of description are what make me think of Victoria Holt, so if you draw pleasure from those aspects you are sure to enjoy this light novel."
3,"Queen Anne Computer Desk 39"" w Mahogany","Customer Service was excellent. However, the desk we received was not mahogany as we know it. We have a great deal of mahogany furniture in our home, and this desk is definitely just a dark red. We purchased the ""mahogany"" computer desk to blend with the furniture already in our home office; and was disappointed when it wasn't a good blend.It was also rather complicated to assemble. The keyboard drawer had a crack in it, but I was pleased when Customer Service replaced that drawer very quickly."
3,Red hot,I thought this was going to be like the other VJ's but it just wasnt as good as the first two.
5,A must have for the collector or dealer!,"Gene and Cathy Florence have done an outstanding job on this book. The pictures are outstanding and an excellent source for identifying various glass pieces. The descriptions are clear and very informative. My only issue is with the prices quoted. As Internet auctions, such as eBay are now the premier source for purchasing or selling depression glass, prices are drastically lower for most items listed in this book. This is also true for other similar books by other authors as well. As on-line auction sites are now the dominant source for depression glass and other collectables, the average prices seen over time on on-line auctions must be taken into account for future values."
4,Image Processing Fast and Easy,A well done tutorial on how to approach complex image processing problems with ease. The book comes with useful documentation and example code that brings difficult theories within reach of amateur programmers or the curious.Rounds out any programming library
4,Very enjoyable,"The numerous commercials contained in these DVDs provide hours of unexpected enjoyment. You'll soon forget that you're watching commercial after commercial as you delve deeper and deeper into a history of popular culture as expressed by the very raison d'tre of American television: commercials, after all, finance the shows that stations air to draw audiences that watch the commercials in the first place. The commercials are very well organized on each disc, and the collection of PSAs are both fascinating to watch as well as enjoyable. The quality of the commercials varies from decent to quite poor, but this can only be expected, considering the fact that commercials are generally considered disposable by the industry and are rarely preserved in the same way as television series are."
3,Might stir some memories,"These are fun to watch for about 10 or 15 mins. Problem is, is that the video is usually quite grainy or off color, making it harder to enjoy what you are watching."
1,Disappointment,Purchased this for my husband as he gets a kick out of things like this. We were both very disappointed that the quality was VERY BAD. It was unwatchable. Sorry I purchased it.
3,Worth the price I paid for it,"Before I sprung for this set I read reviews by others here. As others have stated, not every commercial was stellar and high quality. THere were, however, enough great oldies to trigger some great nostalgic moments for this boomer. Again, some ""not-so-good"" / crappy ones, some even before my time, but plenty worth the price. It is a great addition to the eccentric part of your collection."
3,GREAT COMMERCIALS - POOR QUALITY,"I AGREE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER CONSUMERS WHO BOUGHT THIS SET OF COMMERCIALS. THE COPIES WERE SO POOR. AND THERE IS LOUD FEEDBACK IN MY DISC'S. BUT, BOY THE MEMORIES THEY BROUGHT BACK. I JUST LOVE CIGARETTE COMMERCIALS. THOUGH I AM NOT A SMOKER, I ALMOST BECAME ONE, THANKS TO ALL OF THOSE OLD WONDERFUL CIGARETTE COMMERCIALS. ESPECIALLY THE ONES FOR ""BEL-AIR"" AND ""MARLBORO"" CIGARETTE. I JUST LOVE ""THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN"" THEME, USED FOR THE ""MARLBORO"" CIGARETTE COMMERCIALS. BOY, WAS THE ""MARLBORO MAN"" HANDSOME OR WHAT?! BUY THIS. THE PRICE ISN'T BAD. AND YOU'LL ENJOY EVERY SINGLE MINUTE."
1,Very disappointed,"Every time the commercial should be in color, it is horrible, red, fuchsia or orange. I grew up with these commercials. That's not how they appeared. I don't know if I got a crummy copy or not, but it feels like a waste of money since I couldn't actually see a good many of the commercials. Several of the commercials ""rolled"" while they played. It was poor a poor production."
3,"1,001 Classic Commercials Collection",This DVD would have been much better had they chosen one or two commercials for each product they used or did a few commercials for each decade. They had over 140 cigarette commercials somewhere around 50 commercials just for Marlboro cigarettes and most of those were from the late 50's early 60's and I know they were advertising into the 70's. I would have liked to have seen some of the 7up commercials from the 70's or 80's. Although it was nice seeing some of these commercials again.
2,Not so great,Some of the commercials are played more than once. So their are not really 1001 of them. Much of a rip off!!!
3,commercials,I was kind of bored the night I watched but it was disappointing to me. I thought it would bring back memories but I quit watching after about 15 minutes.
4,OVER 16 HOURS OF BABY-BOOMER COMMERCIALS,"Exactly what I was expecting, over 16 hours of old television commercials from the '50s, '60s & '70s . I would have given this product 5 stars but the picture quality on many of the commercials isn't that good-- I guess that's to be expected. Nothing here has even remotely been digitalized or enhanced in any way. These commercials have been sitting on dusty shelves in a basement somewhere since the last time we saw them, some over 50 years old. For the price it's definately worth it. I bought another series of old commercials last month and paid $25 for only 3 hours. Those exact same commercials are on these DVDs PLUS 13 MORE HOURS!!! One bit of advice if you buy this product...buy two sets. If you lend this out to a baby boomer you'll never see it again."
4,"A trip down memeory lane, and just a trip","The commercials on this disc are of varying quality, but that's to be expected - no one ever thought there'd be a demand for old commercials when they were made, so I imagine they weren't archived very well. Still, there are hundreds of commercials on this disc that'll transport you back to your childhood and make you point at the screen while shouting, ""Hey! I remember that!!!"" A lot of fun, but best taken in small doses."
5,"A must have for serious ""retromercial"" aficionados.","I am quite a fan of retromercials and of pop-culture. I have a huge collection of DVD's of old commercials, both bootlegged from Ebay, as well as legitimate ones like this one. Honestly, this collection, ""1,001 Classic Commercials"" is one of the best collections I have ever seen. 16 hrs of commercials!! PSAs! Industrial promotional training films! Stuff the average person never gets to see. Really, you can learn so much about our shared experience through some of these little gems. It is a very well organized collection, as other reviewers have mentioned, and there is the cool feature that groups brands commercials next to each other. I saw many, many interesting ads. My favorites are for brands/stores that have gone by the wayside of the retail landscape, like the ""Heckle and Jeckle"" inspired ad for Robert Hall Family Clothes. Overall, an excellent value and highly, highly recommended!"
4,Almost too much for the money,"Okay, I made a big mistake with this set. I sat down and watched all 16 hours (!) in a day and a half. Not smart. Maybe an hour a day would have been better. But I couldn't stop myself.Obviously the quality varies. Some (especially the early color ones) are nearly unwatchable. But the gems outweigh the chaff. Or something.When you get multiple ads for the same product, they do get redundant. The cigarette category was especially bad in this regard.The good stuff though...WOW!!! The Flintstones selling cigarettes. The Three Stooges selling cigarettes. A (very) young Peter Boyle. More celebrities than I've ever seen on one dvd.Good ads, bad ads, funny ads. Ads I'd forgotten and ads I've never seen before. I was amazed with this collection.I've only seen 2 other collections of commercials on DVD and this set blew those out of the water. And at a better price.Highly recommended for tv history buffs or fans or just people wanting a reminder of a less frantic time."
3,only fair,"Some of the video is distorted and blurry, probably due to the age and taping technique of the commercials. Early color ones did not show up clearly. But it was a treat to see the old ads and hear the old advertising music. Just wish it were as crisp and clear as the ads on TV today."
2,You get what you pay for,"The price is a bargain, and anyone of the right age will find fond memories in this package.It is, however, a mind-numbing experience if you watch more than a few of these in one sitting (but then, so were the '60s).No attempt has been made at ""film restoration"" so many of the color commercials are washed out or indecipherable. Just what does it say about the attitude of makers of this collection toward us, the buyers, that they included these?"
3,"Amusing, but a bit repetitive.","What's here is good....but, maybe too much of a good thing. Example, the same 'Newport' commercial, with the same jingle, over and over about twenty times. The only thing different were the unknown actors in the same format commercial. Two or three would have been sufficient. Also, some 'classics' you'd expect to be there aren't. Example, about 30 or so Coca Cola commercials, except for the ""I'd like to teach the world to sing"" one. I particularly enjoyed the toy commercials, brought back a lot of great childhood memories I'd forgotten I had! :-)"
3,Better than I Thought,"As one who considers the novel one of the great books of the Twentieth Century, I was leery of and initially disappointed by the film. On second and third viewing it seems better and better--closer to the spirit (if never the style) of the novel than at first viewing. READ THE BOOK but don't be afraid of the film... much of Graham Swift's original conception survives, and nothing with Jeremy Irons in it should be overlooked."
5,A Darkly Beautiful Movie,"I believe this underrated movie is one of the best of this decade. Irons could not be any better--not that I've ever seen him in a bad performance. The movie follows its own unconventional path. It journeys back in time into the lives of the protagonists and Irons' character's family. The cinemaphotography is quite good and the physical settings in the ""moors"" are very beautiful. Lena Headey plays her character quite well--in addition to being gorgeous. All of the actors in the movie are very good.The movie covers the whole gamut of the dark side of life: murder, incest, lust, jealousy, abortion, etc. It's not a smiley, feel good piece of Hollywood fluff. You will not like this movie if that's what you're looking for. But if you're looking for a movie that has something to say about the human condition in an honest and moving way--this is a good bet."
5,EXCELENT,"WATERLAND IS A MOVIE I CAN WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN, EVERY TIME I SEE IT I WALK AWAY WITH THE SAME FEELINGS. IT COMPLETELY HOLDS MY ATTN WITH EVERY SLIGHT DETAIL.WHERE DID THE VIEWER FROM NY,NY GET THAT IT WAS HIS BROTHERS BABY? THIS ENRAGES ME. MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE PAID MORE ATTN TO WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON. DON'T REVIEW SOMETHING YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.GREAT CAST!!!THEY ALL GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION THEY REALLY KNEW THEIR CHARACTERS."
1,Depressing and disappointing,"What's the point of studying history?, a high school student here asks. A wise man once said if we forget the mistakes of the past we are doomed to repeat them. And perhaps that is the point of this picturesque tale. The scenery is beautiful, but the advancing of the plot is contrived (throwing characters into the past as observers), and the whole exercise concludes -- unresolved -- as a smarmy, sordid little soap opera. Certainly, the sins of these characters' pasts come back to haunt them. But what do learn from that? In what directions do these characters grow? Little here worth sitting through except a fine performance by Irons and too little screen time from Ethan Hawke."
3,Lovely,Llewellyn's Magical Almanac 1999 edition is filled with great info. on spell craft and just plain crafty things. I love all the poems and invocations. The Moon chart is very helpful also!
4,An excellent starting place!,"This almanac is very useful for covens and solo witches. The moon charts make setting up moon rituals easy. Plus there are easy to follow spells and incantations. This book, while only applicable for a year, is an excellent starting place for natural witches to hone their craft."
5,backpack review,Item was shipped to me promptly. It was packaged nicely. Great Mets item. Not seen in stores.
4,Book Review,"Dear Mr. Benton,Your book Dear Dumb Diary (never do anything ever) was a hit. I don't know how anyone couldn't read this book. I thought this book was interesting and funny. Ha ha ha this book makes me laugh every time I read what you've written. I've read every Dumb Diary book I've never had a bad review about your books.Your book has so many details and description; I'm surprised it didn't blow up. It's always funny when your character Jamie keeps trying to be popular as this girl at school but never succeeds. I really enjoyed how you used creativity and wrote this book as a diary. That's another reason I like your book.Lastly I want to thank you for writing a great book. I couldn't stop reading your book. It helped me reach my class goal. I even became a more advanced reader. I wish every kid could read a book as good as this.Sincerely,Symphany Davis"
5,great books!,My 10 year old daughter loves these books. She says they are very funny. We want the whole set!
5,I love it!!!!!!!!!!Super adorable!!!!!!!!,"I got my bear last week and it was packed pretty nice. The size is a little small than I expected but it looks super cute!!!! It touches very soft, I really love it!!"
2,Stupid Olsen twins...,"When I was younger, I really, really adored the Olsen twins. I would watch all their movies including this one.The ""You're Invited To..."" series was originally fun for me, but now that I look back it was bland and stupid. The two billionaires dressing up in costumes and singing silly songs about the past decades in this Costume Party one is the same as all their movies. The only good movies with the twins are ""It Takes Two"" and ""The Little Rascals."" The latter has them in one, well-done scene."
1,Expect less from this POS,"As an alum of a top 20 B-School, I thought this would be a perfect fit. However the book is just a colledtion of examples which offer no practical advice. One would be much better off consulting the book ""Discovering Your Career in Business"" by Butler and Waldroop of HBS."
2,disappointing,"Given the pedigree of the author, I was disappointed with this book. For a more useful alternative for MBA jobs, reading the Vault career guides is recommended by my MBA career center."
2,A waste of money...,"I bought this book prior to starting an MBA program because even though I was about to begin a major investment of time and money, I still wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to do with an MBA. After reading this book I was no more sure than before I started."
5,The story & songs are classic.,"My 12 year old son received this video when he was born. My daughter & the children that I babysit often ask to watch ""Puff"" when they have so many other choices. We recently had to cut the tape out of our VCR. I suppose it was too old and probably viewed too much. I was sorry to see that this version is no longer available. Thanks for the memories, Burgess Meredith, and also to the Children's Video Library."
5,excellent condition,Bought this dvd for my nephew. We received it in excellent condition! Very pleased.
2,a little outdated,"This only kept my 4 year old grandson's attention for a little while. I think it is for kids 2 to 3,"
2,Not what Haynes is supposed to be,"In my ""tinkering"" days I used to buy Chilton's for light maintenance documentation and Haynes for deep mayor jobs. I have to say that the Haynes books that I used to have were the ones sold in the UK, and they were awesome. True to form and tradition, when I got my new ""toy"" truck (hey, midlife crisis takes many forms!) I wanted to be able to ""tinker"" with it (in for a penny, in for a pound!) as in my younger years so I bought the Chilton's and this. To my surprise they are both the same. I don't mean they are alike, I mean they are the same book, verbatim!. Not what Haynes used to be, the quality of the phisical book and the quality of the information inside is not what I was expecting. If you want something that will help you with the maintenance of the car, buy either one, but by all means don't buy both. Probably you should buy Chilton because they are still consistent with the kind of book they have always been."
3,Not quite as good as I had hoped,"I used ""Earthjuice"" as background music while I write and surf the web. The various tracks are not as memorable as the A. D. series by various artists, or nearly as catchy as Francois K.'s upbeat dance tracks. I hate to say it, but ""Earthjuice"" is mediocre at best but still worth having to play once in a while. Ras Command alone makes it worth having."
4,good. interesting. deep.,"This cd even has a reverbed sample of the word ""marijuana"" by itself. This is music to smoke pot to."
4,"Solid exposition of Romans, but from Arminian view","In the Romans class I taught this semester, I assigned both this text and Sproul's. It turned out to be a good balance. Seemuth writes well and keeps a Holy Ghost perspective on Paul's timeless words. He forgets, though, that it's possible to be Reformed and Charismatic, and so doesn't explained the Wesleyan/Arminian view as well as he might."
5,Carlos Tells America How We Really Are!,"In ""Take a Joke America"" Carlos Mencia reminds us to never stop laughing, even at the worst of racial problems in America. Carlos' passion to expose the hypocrisis within America will really make you think about who we really are in America today. I've never laughed so hard listening to an audio cd before. But at the same time I was listening to what Carlos was trying to tell us, That we are not in this America to fight all other races out there to remain socially acceptable. With this in mind Carlos tells it how it really is and reminds us again that we must laugh and take it for what it really is..........comedy."
2,Not his best work,"I ordered this CD as a gift for a huge fan of Carlos Mencia, we were both disapointed. My boyfriend and I have seen Carlos on film as well as in person, we both felt that that Carlos is very talented but his best work was not put into this CD. He is an equal opportunist, he puts everyone down and after awhile it starts to get old."
2,No it's not deja vu...,"It's not that comedy about racial stereotypes is offensive to me. It's that I've heard it a million times before, when it was actually funny and enlightening and had real shock value. If you listen carefully enough to Mencia's material, you may notice that it sounds awfully familiar. That's because he blatantly steals and copies, sometimes word for word, other comedians jokes. Simply put, he's unoriginal and unfunny and a thief. We already have Dave Chappelle and Paul Rodriguez and Richard Pryor, and it won't get any better than that folks."
1,CARLOS MENCIA DEE DEE DEE!!!L OLOZLZOZLZOLz!!#,"i've had farts sound funnier than this hack. and yes i sit around and smell them, but its more mind stimulating than listening to a fake mexican talk about how controversial he's about to be and TELL IT LIKE IT IZ when he just says black people eat chicken. really carlos? do they really?"
4,Very decent lens for the money.,"Heavy as lead. Slight ""stickiness"" in the zoom when changing directions at full extension, but nothing major, feels like it will work out. Nice finish, kind of retro, speckled, grainy finish, good gripping and looking. Good, very quiet focusing. Excellent sharpness, using it on a D30 digital, so can't really tell about aberrations at widest and longest, since I lose the edges with my CMOS anyway. FOR THE MONEY, I don't think you have a better choice. Of course, if you can afford it, get the Canon ""L."" Don't think you'll be disappointed for the price."
4,Bang for the buck,"I field-tested this recently and found it to be a good lens for the ~$1000 that I shelled out. Heavy it is indeed due to the 10X zoom...but quality is good for the money. The only flaw I find with this is NO Image Stabilizer. At 500mm even with a heavy tripod, small gusts of wind (20-30 miles) produce vibrations. Faster ISO and multiple snaps however make it a little easier to capture sharp images."
5,"Banana Leaf Storage Bin, Dark Brown","I used this as a Christmas ""gift"" basket for my step-son. I like that he will be able to re-use it for storage purposes & that it folds flat when not in use."
3,Measurements not quite accurate,"This bin is fine...looks nice, etc. However, the actual measurements are more like 12 1/2 x 12 1/2...with the interior space only 12 x 12...so I was not able to use it for what I intended when I purchased it. Had the measurements been accurate, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place."
2,Not as pictured.,This bin is not a natural brown as shown in the picture on-line or even on the actual packaging. It is a very dark and opaquebrown. Also the finish was already flaking off inside the package revealing the natural color of the material beneath. I would not recommend this in a home with young children as the flaking varnish-like finish could be toxic.
5,Shoe Solution,"My wife and I keep our house Japanese style--meaning no shoes in the house. But American houses are really designed for that with specific entryways and shoe-closets. So we needed something that looked nice and could hold shoes.As an affordable solution, we picked these ""Household Essentials Woven-Banana-Leaf Collapsible Storage Bins"" to fit inside thePrepac Manhattan Espresso Cubbie Bench. They bins fit perfectly into the Cubbie Bench, and match in color almost as if they were designed for each other.The baskets are nice and solid, and easy to put together. They don't require any special tools or anything. The brown is quite a dark brown, which is exactly what we were looking for.I am sure you could use these to store pretty much anything. We use them for shoes, and they work great for that!"
1,Impossibly Smelly,"These baskets, which we got as a useable vehicle in place of Easter baskets. But, on Easter, they were opened and reeked of laquer or something and have to be sent back. Very disappointing."
2,Fiber material brittle with flaking finish,"This storage basket is smaller than stated in the Amazon description. I was not able to use it for what I intended when I purchased it. Had the measurements been accurate, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place. Also, I am not impressed with materials. There is some crumbling both the material and dark shellac finish - flakes off easily."
3,beware,"this and others of the series are in the Omnibus Star Wars collection for much less. I order several of this series only to find i already had them in the Omnibus book for less money , alot less money!"
4,Fun (which will be a turn-off to some),"Proving that not everyone looks for the same things in their reading choices, I actually enjoyed the third story best of the three collected here. Comic books in general are just fun reading for me--the palate cleansers between other readings--and these really fit the bill.I really enjoy these large editions of Dark Horse's Empire series. They're reasonably priced and make for a good read. My favorite part may be that I don't have to wait a month (or more) to get the next part of a story. Entire stories are included in each edition."
5,"Simple, common sense approach to real life issues","Edwin Louis Cole not only explains how and why we often get ourselves into relationships that don't work, but what to do about it to restore and maintain your relationships to a healthy balance."
5,It changed my view of my mate & my life.,"Edwin Louis Cole has a down to earth, humorous, hit home style of writing that I was not surprised to find out that what he wrote was true and many of the points have worked for me in creating the lasting relationship I have always wanted. God Bless him for ""Communicating about Sex and Money"", it has changed my life!"
5,Real Help in the Real World,"Ed Cole has written a great book for men. 90% of the problems in marriage come from these 3 areas, Communication, sex, and money. This book helped me work through some of the legacy left to me by an unsaved father. My wife is gratefull that I read and applied this book."
5,good book,I appreciated reading it and sharing it as well with othersAny more books by this same author?Please let me know?
3,Okay - Served my purpose.,You get what you pay for here. Shelves came slightly bent but mostly straightened when unit was assembled. Wheels were horrible and cheap. Luckily I didn't really need them. If mobility is a necessity for you keep looking for another product.
4,Very fun,"This anime was a blast to watch. Quality of animation was awesome. Cool post-apacoliptic feel, fun story, awesome action sequences, and i love the style. The comedy made me laugh too. Definitely worth it for anime fans! Ill be gettin part two asap! Def very fun."
1,Very disappointed.,"I purchased this DVD to show Rabat to my family, as I will be going to study there for several months. The production quality of this DVD was very poor. The video quality is nearly unacceptable and the music is awful ""elevator"" style - just bland, generic music. The DVD is only 25 minutes long and hardly covers the city at all.It poorly describes a few of the historic sites, and does not discuss daily life, the modern city, or Moroccan people at all. All of these things are necessary to illustrate what Morocco is really like for someone visiting. I would strongly recommend you do not buy this video as it would be overpriced at half the cost."
2,Ehhhh,"The concept of this book is good, and many classic rappers/groups are depicted, but the art is lacking. The line-drawings are very simple, with little detail. A good coloring book has lots of detail to make it fun to color; if someone were to actually color in this book, it would get pretty boring. The book's only saving grace is the Bone Thugs page... that one's pretty good."
3,Idea was funnier than the actual book,This book was alright! I bought it as a gag gift.Idea was funnier than the actual bookJust some pic to color of all the rap artists.Not sure what I was expecting but ah well
1,CF.Adams: Homicide Investigator,"This Color Book is a disgrace to every African American. As a Homicide Investigator who has worked many murders of young Black teenager males this coloring book doesn't help to stop the problem on ""Black on Black Murders"" involving juvenile males. I am outrage by the images of weaponry and killing and prison and thing of that nature. I don't see this coloring book to be a fitting image for our young people. Maybe the Author of this coloring book should come and spend a day with me during an autopsy of a 15 year Black male who was killed by gang violence."
3,Look Again,"It's funny that some people are complaining about this item. First off, the 'bullet' in the chamber on the front page is a crayon. What is that saying? And what parent in their right mind would even think about purchasing this for a child. Look at the publication date. It's old."
4,Research on the Adirondacks,"I was looking for a book to consider taking a trip to the Adirondacks. There are not many with just that topic. In the past I have used Frommer's travel books happily. I knew this would have good information. It was more than I wanted, covering the whole state which would require a lot of info on NYC, but it was worth my while to purchase."
3,"Good, but incomplete","Frommer's New York State, 4th edition, is a fairly useful book. I found that it had good information on the locations it covered.However, there is no information at all on some cities. For instance, we were going to Oswego on a recent trip, and it is not mentioned in any way.We did find some helpful information on most of our destinations on our recent trip to upstate New York."
1,No Hotels,Not what I expected. Thought there would be listings of hotels and there wasn't anything. Just outdoors stuff.
1,Frommer's NYS Travel Books are the BEST!!!!!,"We recently purchased the Frommer's NYS 3rd edition Travel Guide and it is wonderful. Packed with great info on best places to visit. We were especially excited about the info we got about the FingerLakes Canandaigua area and the review's about the Bed & Breakfast's in the area.The Chalet of Canandaigua, apparently a NEW B&B; in the area seems an awesome place to stay based on the descriptive 3 star review! The book is great to use,the What's New Section which leads you to the detail area section was a great way to guide your decision on where to stay, what to do when you get there!!!I would highly reccommend getting this book to help plan a vacation or simply a quick getaway whether your from another country, another state or a NYS resident!"
5,"It's a ""Great Bang for the Buck!""","It's refreshing to read business advice from someone who runs a successful business for a living. Goltz's book is based on reality, not theory. My wife and I have owned our business (25 employees) for 21 years and combined we have read dozens and dozens of business books. It is rare when we both enjoy the same book. I found myself myself laughing out loud, nodding my head in agreement and taking notes. It's an enjoyable read and the advice is well worth the price of the book."
5,This book covers a lot of issues I have never seen anywhere,"I have probably read ten business books since I have started my business. I am always looking for ways to solve my problems and grow my business and found most of the other books on the market to be of limited value. Goltz's book on the other hand talks about the real problems I have from and firing to how to borrow money from the bank. I found myself taking notes through out the book and actually put many of his ""lessons"" to use the next day at work. This book is a must read for anyone who is running a business!"
4,Business Lessons Learned the Hard Way,"The Street Smart Entrepreneur is a well-written book that draws upon Goltz's experiences in the workforce. In his book, he details the useful lessons he learned, some of which may seem like common sense, but others could be quite surprising, such as how entrepreneurs are not necessarily the best person to hire new employees. Because of its reliance on Goltz's own experiences, The Street Smart Entrepreneur possesses solid credibility. It's as good as Guerilla PR: Wired, which also supplies valuable lessons on business leadership and entrepreneurial tips."
4,One of 133 can be enough,"A lot of us business people have management ideas...but few of us ever come to grips with how to implement them in any meaningful way.Jay Goltz was smart: He offers the simple idea...shows how he learned (usually the hard way) how that concept applied to his business...then suggests action stepls.The short but sweet resenttion of each keeps the reader interested.If only one idea w worthwhile, this book would have been a good investment.For me, it was a GREAT investment, for I continue to review it (so easy to do) and add to the list of changes I want to make in my own buisness.Nice going, Jay."
1,Very Disappointed,Received kettle looked cute and just what I wanted size wise I trust the Revere Ware name. But after 1 use it doesn't stay open/locked anymore & does not whistle anymore either. It's under warrantee for a year so I am going to contact the company.
1,Bad Design - Not Functional,Don't buy this tea kettle. It doesn't whistle past a whisper and the handle is too hot to touch when removing unit from stove and pouring hot water into the teacup.
1,Doesn't whistle,Steam leaks out around the whistle spout cover instead of going through the hole in the top of the spout cover. Poor fit.
1,disappointing,"I purchased this tea kettle as a gift and we are very unhappy with it. After just a few uses, it began to show signs of rust and corrosion around the bottom edge, so there must be a leak somewhere. The spout drips when pouring. I do like the off-set design of the opening for filling and cleaning, but it was hard for an older person to remove the lid (although I suppose that might get easier with more use.) If you have owned and used RevereWare products for many years (as I and the gift recipient have) you may find that this kettle does not nearly measure up to the quality of their older pots, pans, and kettles. It is not very well-made."
1,Do NOT buy this kettle,"Very poor design, hot steam comes out the trigger slot. This burns your finger when you try to open the spout, which must be opened to pour. If it wasn't so much trouble, I would return it to Amazon."
4,Nice little whistling kettle,"This whistling tea kettle heats enough water to make two 12-oz cups of tea, hot cocoa, etc. The whistle starts as a cute little chirping sound as the water begins to create steam, then progresses to a rather loud, sharp whistling that you just can't ignore. The easy-fill opening is very nice, too. Don't overfill, though, because you'll end up with a hot, wet mess on your stove top."
5,Still good quality,I replaced an old Revere 4-cup with this one and I am not disappointed. the look is more streamlined and the whistle and water heating are the same.
2,"Great size, not great quality","Loved the ""tea for one or two"" size, and it was easy to fill, but the entire whistle assembly fell off with minimal use in short order. Too bad, it was cute while it lasted."
1,Horrid,"Too small to be of much use, this tea kettle is also too hot to handle. Using a pot holder on a tea kettle is clumsy and should not be necessary. Keep searching, there has to be something better out there."
5,It's About Time!,"I will leave it to others to write a synopsis of the characters and story of this series based on the books by James Thomas Flexner. I have seven children ranging from two years of age up to fifteen. Every member of my family, all nine of us, are GLUED to it every time we watch it. It is excellent for family viewing.This title and it's sequel, George Washington: Forging of a Nation, belong in every home and every library in the country! When will we see them on DVD?!!!"
4,We need this on dvd!,What could be better to watch over the 4th of July than this miniseries? I echo others sentiments and want to ask whoever is in control of the rights to please put this on dvd. I can't believe it is not yet available.
5,An Excellent Intimate History of Washington,"This miniseries came out when I was in 2nd grade. Our teacher had a poster up for it and encouraged us to watch every installment, which I did, and loved it. It really needs to be on DVD. It sucks that someone is trying to scalp us $180 for used VHS tape of this, and I won't pay that, but hope CBS sees fit to put it on DVD soon."
3,OK BUT FULL OF ERRORS,"This book is a quick look at the major maritime mishaps of the last century. It includes the Titanic, Lusitania, Morro Castle and Andrea Doria, among others. It makes for a fast and enjoyable read.The book was written by a journalist and published by the Associated Press, however, so it contains the mistakes one has come to expect from the media. Names are given incorrectly and photos wrongly attributed. One gets the impression the author doesn't much care about such things. The shipwreck enthusiast will likely enjoy the book anyway, though."
5,"""Looks Like I Picked The Wrong Week To Expect Hit Singles""","Poor RCA. There they were, riding high on having chart success with a rock act besides Elvis, and these ungrateful little buggers delivered a followup album of all this decidedly weird music.Fortunate, though, for music lovers, as this is the JA album that first showed the real instrumental firepower that was behind the 3 singers. Although the songs were not geared for AM radio play, they are consistently fine, and display an aggressively exploratory nature both musically and lyrically. This is an album meant to be played LOUD, and although the topics are very much of the time, it really hasn't dated as many of its contemporary ""hippie"" musical adventures have.A true forebearer of heavy metal, and something that's remained on my playlist since its release. It should be on your playlist, too."
2,Overblown rubbish,"The great problem with Jefferson Airplane was they couldn't write a great song to save themselves. ""Somebody to Love"" and ""White Rabbit"", which Grace Slick brought from her old band, elevated ""Surrealistic Pillow"" to an above average listen. However the bulk of Baxter's is overblown, self indulgent and plain boring. Unless you are an avid Airplane fan or have a specific interest in the music of this period, don't bother."
5,Superb music,This is one of the psychedlic period albums that completely transcends that label and the time in which it was produced. Why?Wonderfully complex:compositioninterplay between musiciansindividual musicianshipsinging
4,Airplane Experiments,"Compared to their previous album ""Surrealistic Pillow"" this is an album not so easy to get into. Only few songs have the qualities of standing alone; the songs are tied together in themes and the album is meant to be listened to as a whole.A few tracks, though, have the commercial qualities of the S.P. songs. Paul Kantner's ""Martha"", which is also included in the single version, is my personal favorite and its a song that would be an obvious choice to represent the album on a best of J.A. compilation.A lot of experiments and strange sounds are going on throughout the album, which can make it hard to listen to as background music. But if you are prepared to listen more concentrated, you won't be bored. The band sounds inspired and the playing is great; ( as always ).Among the bonus-tracks the single-version of ""Martha"" and Marty Balin's ""Things are Better in the East"" are great additions"
3,Be Aware,"Please be aware that this Karen Dalton is not the late Karen Dalton who released two fine albums in the very early 70's. Without passing judgement on this album, which remains unheard by the writer, both of the late, older Karen Dalton's albums have been reissued on cd."
5,"""Must"" reading for all aspiring film makers.","Filmmakers offer their advice on how to avoid setbacks and produce an independent film on a budget in this handbook, which combines such interviews with tips on how to locate talent and make a film. Practical insights make for an important coverage packed with film and business tips."
2,Maybe I expected more,"I had a hard time with this book as soon as I read the first chapter. How can these ""filmmaking experts"" be considered as such if the majority of them had only made one film each? And most of them hadn't even done a feature! If these are experts, go to any school that offers a filmmaking major and pick seven students. They seem about as qualified as the people who were discussed in the book."
3,well......o.k.,"Ordered this book, cause I like Ramsay. It's nice, but 90% of the recipes I would never make. Gave it to my daughter (regifted) and said the same."
3,Pixie,"I like this book but I'd like a few more recipes that don't have so much fish in it. My husbands not a fish eater and well it's hared for me to use this book, but I love Gordon Ramsay cooking and all of hhis shows . I'm hooked!!!!"
1,J. Newman,I really did not like this book! I live in a small city so a lot of the ingredients in the recipes were not available to me. I mailed the book back the very next day of receiving it. If you like simple food or simple recipes this book would not be for you.
1,Never again...,"This is the second Ramsey book I've bought. The first one was a real disappointment, and I'd hoped that was just a fluke. This one has little to offer any normal cook or chef, seemingly aimed at people who have an unlimited access to seldom seem ingredients and a larger budget for food than most of us. A real disappointment. I thoroughly enjoy his several TV shows, but won't be buying any of his cookbooks again..."
2,Nothing to eat,"While I am a big fan of Mr. Ramsay, I was very disappointed with this book. After reading through it, there was simply no food that I wanted to eat in it and I found the cooking instructions and meal planning obtuse."
2,Gourmet Fast Food?,"Wow, this book is great. Only if you want gourmet food. I was hoping this stuff (ingredients) would be easily available, not so. I was looking forward to items I see on hells kitchen and other shows on bbc. Sure, its Gordons best all the time."
3,Limited Appeal,"Over one-third of the recipes in this book are for fresh seafood: Good news if you live near the coast - Bad news for the rest of us. Four more recipes call for creme fraiche (not readily available to most of us) and another for Iberian Ham (also not readily available). He offers no help if you want to make substitutions. For the price of this book I would have hoped for a more recipes I could use. Although Ramsay gives the simplest of instructions, all of the recipes are extremely easy to prepare. I should add that this book is loaded with color photos which I find to be a definite plus."
4,30 Minutes or less doesn't belong only to Rachel Ray,"I know some reviewers have found this book a disappointment, but I love it. Everything I have made out of here is delicious and pretty easy to make. There have been some comments about fresh ingredients. All good chefs really make an effort to buy fresh ingredients because they make food taste better. But substituting works just fine if you can't find it. Creme fraiche can be made. It can also be found in high end stores in the dairy case. If the receipe can handle some sweetness, sometimes whipped creme can be used. I live in Arizona and believe me the stores here are pitiful, but I have found everything I need for every dish in the book. Gordon Ramsay delivers the goods and lots of his food is much better in 30 minutes than anything Rachel Ray has come up with (although I like her food, too)."
2,Disappointing,"If you are allergic, or don't like seafood, don't buy this book. It's very heavily weighted to seafood. There are also a number of ingredients that are either very hard to come by in North America, or some that I couldn't even figure out what they were! Of the other recipes, some of them are much too obvious and easy, such as fajitas..."
4,Good food fast,"I don't know what people who are familiar with Ramsay could have been expecting? I wouldn't call this gourmet cooking, but it is sophisticated... but accessible. The recipes are easy and delicious, My teen son (a Ramsay fan) and I have made several of the dishes and have enjoyed them. They are great for entertaining, as they are quick, yummy, gorgeous to look at and special enough for company. He prepares a few of the dishes on podcasts at itunes. Check them out if you aren't that familiar with Ramsay's idea of fast food."
4,"Good book, great ideas.","I don't find the ingredients in most of the recipes hard to find. But I am in Northern California and most things are abundant here. Fish selections vary because of water temps but a comparable fish can be found in the same family.Some of the recipes are really good. This is a book for a more experienced cook. As with most cooking, precise measurements really don't exist. This is no exception.But though I'm not fond of his trash mouth, I love his passion for good, tasty food. If you're into cooking, this is a good book to have."
3,Un Dia Con el Diablo,Good classic movie; thought it'd be in color but overall a good film. The movie wasn't for me but I believe the recepient enjoyed it.
4,Zen and Westerners,"Wonderful introductory book to Zen Living in the Western world, how we can be mindful (therefore more effective) parents, spouses, parents, friends, individuals. I didn't realize how much we value multi-tasking until I read this book and laughed at the image of the person doing day-trading on the computer while on the cell phone talking to the babysitter while thinking about what to wear at tonight's party. What a hoot! We are in a waking coma of busy-ness, and Zen helps us declutter our minds. My only wish was that more emphasis was put on meditating."
2,Indemnity: Rage Of A Jealous Vampire,I WAS WAITING FOR MORE OF THE HISTORY AND THE EFFECTS OF SLUGGISH WELL PELICULAS I DO NOT LIKE ME VERY MUCH
2,Weakest Conan yarn of them all,It is doubtful that more than a fewscraps of howards notes contributed to the tale wich seems a misfit afterthought to his legacy- but still a must read for me.
1,Original Stooges fans: stay away from this one!,"Thank God it only cost five bucks...this video is a turkey. If you're looking for original Stooges (Larry, Moe & Curly), you'll be disappointed with this one. Two hours, only one Curly episode in there. Three Shemps (second-rate), and the rest is 3 Stooges cartoons (need I say more?), and other filler. Can anybody recommend a video packed with original Stooges? Please drop me an e-mail...thanks. And even if it's only five bucks, don't waste it on this"
1,STAY AWAY,This video is no big deal. One episode with Curly and a bunch of other stuff that is just not funny.
3,Watchable But Uneven TV Movie,"Roxanne: The Prize Pulitzer is a 1989 TV movie that has enough story and decent acting to warrant some attention. Based on Roxanne Pulitzer's 1987 autobiography, this story understandbly doesn't give much sympathy to her eventually divorced husband, Peter Pulitzer, ably played by an alternately charming and then despicable Perry King whom viewers will remember from Mandingo and the TV series Riptide. Roxanne Pulitzer is played by Chynna Phillips, daughter of Michelle and John Phillips of the Mamas and Papas musical group, who delivers a more than adequate novice performance. Also appearing is a very young looking Courtney Cox as Roxanne's sometime friend Jacquie Kimberly. The show provides glimpses of the cocaine-fueled liaisons and the seductive jet-set lifestyles of the Palm Beach elite, but much of the movie dwells on the ugly divorce and custody battle of the once golden pair. Worth a look, but don't expect Shakespeare."
3,Tiny!,These are gorgeous but tiny! I made the mistake of not reading the fine print and noting the size. I don't mind small earings but these take the cake!
5,"A MUST HAVE for anyone who has EDS! For patients, BY patients!","I don't even remember where I got this from, but it came to me right after I was diagnosed, and it was ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BOOKS I EVER READ...EVEN NOW, AFTER 12+ YEARS HAVE GONE BY! My only goal is to try to get together w/the author, and write basically the same thing, more indepth, but still easy to understand. I feel this is something EVERY doctor who diagnoses EDS in patients should give to those patients as they are diagnosed!!!"
4,Ehlers Danlos Syndrome,This book has helpful information about EDS and is recommended reading for patients with EDS.
2,minus 3 stars because no bloopers!!,I'm a huuuuuuuuuuuuuge scrubs fan! and i loved the sixth season. The only problem i had is that there are no bloopers even though it's listed on the outside cover! That makes me really upset.
1,Good episode! Horrible purchase!,"I love this episode, it's the main reason I purchased it. But I purchased it to put on my phone. Total BS you can't download it onto it or even your computer for that matter. Waste of money! I should've bought it on iTunes."
2,"Scrubs fans, save your dollars $$$","I have been a huge fan of Scrubs from the beginning, I own all of the seasons including season 6. I'm very pleased with my first 5 seasons, however season 6 is not like scrubs... My advice, don't buy it. They ran out of ideas, they repeat themselves, it is not funny anymore. Before I could not stop laughing at the adorable sarcasm, however this one is really dry. Oh, and what is the musical all about? The whole episode wasted on singing. Useless. As much as I love scrubs, I still regret buying this one."
4,Scrubs Season Six,"In its sixth season, Scrubs is still one of the funniest and most original shows on television. The single camera format lends itself to any number of creative concepts, stunts and gags that would simply be impossible in a traditional live studio audience sit-com. The cast and crew continue to take on unique challenges this season, including the critically acclaimed ""My Musical"" episode, with many inspired numbers such as the ""Guy Love"" duet and ""It All Comes Down to Poo.""With that said, season six is not the strongest performance to date. Some episodes seemed a little mailed-in and predictable, and one begins to wonder by the end of the season if certain key characters have developed at all from the whiny and neurotic (albeit entertainingly whiny and neurotic) characters they were in season one.Still, the Scrubs library remains one of my most replayed DVD collections, and Season Six is no exception. Even a bad rerun of Scrubs beats most first run comedy these days."
2,Nothing wrong with the show....but....,Love the show and nothing wrong with the show itself. But there was scratched on disc one already and cant watch at all.... So dissapointed.....
2,disappointment for/from a die hard Scrubs fan,"The decline began with Season Five and only worsened with Season Six. What used to be about comic situations has gotten too wrapped up in storylines that center around interpersonal melodrama. Scrubs is not ER, nor should it attempt to emulate that formula. The gags are stereotyped around flat characterizations. The ironic thing is that the writers are attempting to add character depth, but that has never been the focal point of the series. JD's internal monologues are still a clever narration device, but don't expect many laughs from this season. In my opinion, the first four seasons rule supreme. These last two seasons, however, lack the clever creativity of the previous seasons. They have become gimmicky."
3,Writers on strike?,"It is Scrubs, and if you like me have followed the characters for 5 seasons already, you will still feel that warm recognition as you pop the disc in for viewing.This time over something has changed at Sacred Heart. Where the cast had a wonderful spark in their interaction, dialogue fluent and natural, it now feels scripted and stale.Some of the episodes feel like quick-fixes and bridges, where real material was lacking. I did enjoy it but for the first time I felt disappointed, like something was lacking.Nevertheless, I am still a fan eagerly awaiting season 7, hopefully the magic will be back."
4,Almost worth it for one song,"I love you period is great, the rest is okay. His work with the Georgia Satellites is better overall but this is along those lines."
2,"Wow, I was NOT impressed!!","I bought this for my son, thinking it would be FULL of lullaby's, stuff I could sing or rock him to, I was wrong!! There is like what, one song?!?! My cats watch this more than my son, just because of all the moving objects on the screen. I do LOVE the Baby Einstein DVD's but this one is a miss!! I don't recommend it! I am sure there are other, better lullaby dvd's out there! I mean, its cute but not what I expected it to be at all!!"
1,worst einstein yet,"I have many einstein videos to compare this one to. So let me say...don't waste your money! First of all, this video goes to a black screen for more than 7 seconds at times, between clips. My baby starts looking around and fussing every time there's a black screen. Second, it repeats the same clips over and over. How many times can my child look at the same ocean shot and still be entertained?! Not to mention, the age goes from entertaining little ones, to the kind of entertainment only a toddler would enjoy. And last, I'm sick and tired of having to fast forward through all of the stupid introductions before the video starts. They have to put the caterpillar clip on TWICE before the video starts. (But that's just a beef I have with ALL of their einsteins.) HATED this one! My baby gets excited with Mozart and Bethoven."
2,dull,Not nearly as good as the rest. Son bored after a minute. Wish I had never purchased this. Cd would have been better
1,Boring,This is the worst Baby Einstein movie we got. My 12 month old lost the interest after 5 min.Even music is boring :(
2,Disappointing Commercial,"The content of this video is a bit slow, which is probably more by intent than anything - I'm good with boring for bedtime preparation. My issue with this video is more the commercial at the beginning and the end of the video for the new Einstein Pals product line. They placed the commercial inside the ""Play Once"" and ""Repeat Play"" parameters, so once he's worn down from the 'boring' video, the stupid upbeat commercial comes on with louder tone and awakening pictures to ruin the ""mood"". Disney has plenty of other opportunites to market their materials without inserting a contradictive ad to what should be a mellow video."
2,This was a miss - at least for my child,"We have several of the Baby Einstein DVD's and all of them keep my 5 mos old son entranced for the length of the DVD. I only use them on the fussy days when I just need a break. Figured this one might be good to calm him and keep him briefly occupied. Brief it is. He is bored within 5 minutes. Played it the whole way through several times and each time he starts to cry and turn away w/i a short time. Pop in another one and he is fine. When I watched it...it is soothing, but does not have the other animations, movement that the others have and I think he is bored. thankfully it was a gift!"
5,loved it!!,Great lullaby music and visional pictures. My daughter can sit there watching it and fall to sleep.
5,"very cute, realistic looking baby chimp","We ordered this baby chimp for a school project and were absolutely delighted when he arrived! It looks just like a real chimp baby, with realistic ""fur"", yet soft and cuddly.Super cute, good quality!"
5,The most important documentary in America,"I was blown away by this documentary.It displays how easy it would be for people to hack into our electronic voting machines and change the vote count, and tracks many cases where this appears to have happened.This is the most important documentary in America!"
2,No plot -- hastily thrown together skits,"The 123 Count With Me video starring Ernie is much better done, with lots of muppet acting and takes the numbers to only 15, but with a personal touch. That video totals upto 45 minutes of enjoyment for parents and toddler. This video on the other hand features all of 2 minutes of Elmo, Telly, Gabi and another child. There is not coherent plot -- i.e. while they start off with a video game premise, they just throw together all of the skits on numbers, and never have the muppets appear to actually lead in each script. After a while of random skits on half the numbers, Elmo or Telly makes a brief aimless appearance. And even stranger, there is an unexplained scary cookie chasing them. This approach quickly turns off both the parents and the toddlers who wait for glimpses of their favorite characters. Pass on it. AND the DVD version is made without any extras, such as subtitles, or sing-alongs etc."
3,Just so-so,"This video is not one of the better Sesame Street videos I've seen. My 2 year old son was excited to get it because he's an Elmo fan, but all through the video he keeps asking ""Where did Elmo go?"" That's because Elmo is hardly in the video. Instead, he shows up only occassionally after very disjointed counting segments. Very disappointing for my son. Also, the so-called plot of being inside a game is weak. Rather than Elmo and Telly actually finding the numbers, which is supposed to be the premise of the story, the video just goes from short cartoons about one number to the next. I do think it's educational and my son will watch it - or at least part of it -occassionally but it's definitely not one of his (or my) favorites."
4,Does What It's Supposed To,"I guess if you are looking for an entire DVD of Sesame Street classics from your childhood, you will be disappointed. But who are you buying the DVD for, anyway? This is definitely not the best Sesame Street video we have, but it does do what is supposed to do. My toddler was counting to 20 (not just 10...) in no time at all and she can even identify all the individual numbers. As for the giant cookie, am I the only one who finds charm in the sheer sillyness of that? ""Look at the size of those raisins!"" still cracks me up.The only thing that bugged me was toward the end when Zoe forgets what comes after the letter J. I really think it would have benefited the video if someone would have taken the time to edit."
2,A weak entry into the Sesame Street canon,"This math-oriented video is a fairly weak, late-edition Sesame Street product. Included are a couple of older (high-quality) numbers-oriented cartoons, such as ""King Of Eight"" and ""Alligator King,"" but they are surrounded by a ton of lesser material -- lame, later stuff that has an annoying quality that you don't expect from Sesame Street. Elmo and Telly are supposedly the stars of the program, but the feeble skits they are in (instead of doing or learning math, they mostly just get chased by a giant cookie) and most of the animation is also pretty brainless, even irritating. If you value the intelligence and good humor that was the Sesame Street trademark, this video will be a big disappointment... We watched it once, then I quietly tucked it away and took it back."
2,Review from a Dad of a toddler,"I strongly advise you against buying this DVD.This is by far the worst Sesame Street video that we have in our collection...My boy only sees the first two minutes in which Elmo appears, after that he totally looses interests in the video.Overall, don't buy this DVD."
1,Don't bother,"Totally lame! Not only am I bored, but so is my 21 month old son. We got this video in a set with ""Do the Alphabet"" and he loves that one, but won't even sit through 2 minutes of this one. Don't waste your money."
5,Richard Scarry does it again!,My 2.5 yr old loves this video. My 18 month old isn't as into it as he is - but that's probably because of the developmental stage he is at versus her. They love Scarry's characters and he is completely captivated by the video. Highly recommend it for 2+ yrs.
2,Boring!!,"My 22 month old daughter found this video incredibly boring and actually cries for me to turn it off. She loves the leap frog videos, but hates this."
5,Great learning tool!,"I am really anti-videos for young children, theoretically! However, I have found this video to be very helpful in getting my 2 year old to understand the concept of counting. She could count to 20 before, but now she counts out everything from goldfish to babies! and she does it correctly! She loves this video and I don't mind her watching it! It is very sweet and likeable and has some catchy songs. I highly recommend it."
1,Trite Tripe,"i do not agree that richard scarry has produced the best counting video ever. in fact, i find the video offensive and poorly done. the characters are one-sided and non-human. the songs are passionless, the bunnies are poor actors, and i find the farmer creepy. also, since my son has begun watching this video, he has voiced to me that he believes that he is a bunny himself, and that i am a mommy bunny. this must be stop. i believe that richard scarry has a hidden agenda, and that my son has fallen victim to this agenda. i would also like to bring to your attention that i suspect that the main character bunny is addicted to drugs. the next time that you view the film, look in her eyes! are these the types of role models that you want for your children?i would rather my child not learn to count to twenty at all than to be subjected to this video."
2,This thing is junk but my kid loves it,"My 33 month old loves it - it's junk, the production quality is weak, and the ""story"" is lame but my kid loves it. I think it was a great value given how many times he's watched it."
5,Great way to learn counting,"Our two-year old daughter loves this video. She is always asking to see her ""bunny counting"" video. She has learned to count to 20, and a major reason was this video. I highly recommend it. It is the best counting video I've found.The animation is basic (and even slightly glitchy in one instance), but it's not the sort of thing little kids care about. The content and educational value are first-rate. Our daughter loves the sweet animal characters.We like that the presentation is low-key, not like some of the loud, frenetically paced stuff you see nowadays. If your kids see a lot of TV, they might have a different reaction than our daughter did to this video. We don't let her watch a lot of video unless it's educational (studies show TV and rapidly changing video images are not healthy for kids' brain development, especially before age 3)."
3,great shorts but dont let the size fool you,I typically wear a 34 or 36 but these shorts feel a size or more smaller than what you normally wear. If you buy them I suggest buying a size or 2 up. I believe one of the other reviewers had the same issue.
4,Durable pants,"These are cool looking and durable. I took one star because they are very heavy and thick. They are not super baggy, underwear-showing pants. Runs true to size."
2,MISSING STUD ON POCKET,"Since these shorts are so nice and my husband Loves them so much he wore them as soon as he got them, there was a stud missing from the outside of left pocket. I showed him but he is keeping them anyway because he likes them so much and does not want to wait for the exchange process!!!Other than that I guess they are pretty good shorts!!"
2,felt weird,"they're well made, but i found them uncomfortable. they felt loose in the front and tight in the back like somebody had cut the pattern wrong. these are the ones i wear when i realize i should have done the laundry yesterday and kick myself."
2,Overpriced- Overrated,I think for the price I expected them to hold together better than they are. They are streching out where the valcroe attatches.
4,Beautiful voice!,"I bought this CD for the first song on it, which had been playing on my TV music channel. It is a beautiful melody which stops you in your tracks. The rest of the album is just as good, although I wish the Iroquois words were translated in the album notes. Very soothing and relaxing."
5,An cd to listen to over and over again. Equisite,Every song on the cd spoke to my heart and carried me to where the singer wanted to take me. This is the ultimate in performing. The clarity of the singer and the accompaniment stood second to none.
3,Not for me,"Be prepared for a ""new agey"" experience. I rarely like music that isn't in a language that I know. And this is far too mellow musically to make up for the language barrier"
5,Best cd that I ever bought !!!,"Joanne Shenandoah is such a wonderful singer, that I can't think of another singer in the wold who's better than she is!!!! Love to her from Barbro"
4,old fashioned remedies that seem to work,"An 89-year-old friend of mine who's been using tissue salts for years recommended this little volume. I bought all 12 tissue salts along with this book and have been using some of the remedies with guidance from the book. I have been successfully warding off bronchitis with the help of numbers 4,9, and 12. It's quite possible I'm under the influence of the placebo effect, but who knows and who cares - as long as they work. Keep in mind these are homeopathic remedies made popular in the 1890's. You can look up almost any malady and find a tissue salt remedy."
3,Beware the Bamix- a hand blender.,"Under the Christmas tree was a Bamix hand mixer for me and I was excited. As the sales clerks at Williams Sonoma know I have been pining for this elite blender. Somehow my sig ot got the clue and it was way more appreciated than the car bra that I received a couple of years ago. But with great sadness I returned it today-my last opportunity for a full refund.Why I don't like it:It's a bit clunky and hard to hold.The blades easily get gooked up and are hard to get on and off.It often blew the gfi circuit breakers, even with no load. None of my other appliances have done this.The final straw was an article in the NYT of 1/16/2013 on the dangers of immersion blenders. Interviews with hand surgeons documented how this appliance is augmenting their business. It was the picture on the front page of the food page of my prized bamix, dripping blood, that told me no one needs an immersion blender as powerful as this one."
2,Just because you're an ER nurse doesn't mean you can write!,"While parts of this story are gripping, Mr. Deer's writing style is banal and linear. This is most certainly not literature, and episodes of ""ER"" or ""Scrubs"" are written equally well, if not better. Given the exciting subject matter, you can hardly help but be pulled into the book early. Once you make it through a few chapters, however, the stories becomes tired and thin. The sidetrack in the middle of the book comes off as preachy, not moving. And if Mr. Deer wants to be a writer, then he needs to have an editor! This book is so full of misspellings, typos, and incorrect grammar that it distracts the reader and detracts from Mr. Deer's credibility. I will pass on Deer next novel."
4,Regal Puff Dress,Overall I really liked this dress. The only thing I didn't like about it was the sash. The dress needed to have a little bit of color somewhere on it. So we added a hot pink sash to dress it up a bit.
5,Beautiful Gown!,Beautiful dress and wonderful quality for the price. The shipping was fast and efficent. The dress arrived in perfect condition. I would highly recommend this dress.
3,Stuffed Rhino,Very cute and soft. Just right for little hands. Just check the seams. We had a tiny un-stitched spo.t
5,visionary and exhilarating!!,"These essay-stories have an effect on the mind like some kind of elixir from an ancient forest. Things sparkle, the world looks different after you read them; you feel more alive. I've never read a book quite like this in my life. I am about halfway through and I find myself reluctant to read on because I don't ever want to finish! Then again, these essays will probably continue to deliver upon second and third readings; they are so rich and refreshing, generous and infectiously exuberant. O'Grady weds highly specific familiarity with nature to a deep, sweeping historical knowledge. The result is precisely the opposite of ""scholarly."" It's wild. And yet it's also ultimately friendly, perhaps even loving in a kind of impersonal, woodsy, ferocious way. I think if more people read this book, there would be less fear of death and more appreciation of life in our cultural zeitgeist. This book is its own little force of sanity."
4,So Powerful and so Real!,this movie is so real and so touching. It reminded me of my old life and of my family as well. everything is so real in this film. it really hit home! thank God we got films like that done and distributed!
2,Breaks easily - really disappointed,"I've had my Eureka upright for just 6 months and I bought it because I have a lot of stairs and a dog that sheds. The Power Paw stopped rotating about 3 months in, so I took it apart, cleaned out the hair, and noticed a small piece had broken off the inside plastic piece holding in the roller. I had the plastic piece but didn't realize that's what it was until it stopped rotating again last week, and I found the plastic piece on the other side had a piece broken off. I tried to super glue one of the broken pieces back on (had to use tweezers to hold the small piece) but it wouldn't take. So now I either pay $16 for a new Power Paw or do without. I have lots of stairs so I really needed this to work and I am very disappointed with it. I expected better from Eureka."
2,Great while it works but....,The Power Paw works great for about 10 uses. Then it gets slower and slower and eventually quits. This is the second Paw I have owned and in both cases it starts out to be everything you would want in a vacuum tool but quits working in no time. I am really disappointed in the lack of longevity.
2,"Works great, but very fragile!","This works great at getting pet hair off of my sofa (I have a grey cat and a black sofa, so every little hair shows up!), but during the life of my vacuum, I've had to purchase three of these attachments because they break so easily.The Eureka vacuum only lasted 2 years, but the power paw was even less hardy. I'll probably try another brand next time."
2,power paw,I had a bissel (model ?). My wife wanted a paw that does a good job with stair. I got dispppointed with the technology it uses to roll the brush. Eureka Capture has a power paw and it is yet see the result.
2,Great while it lasted,"Bought the Power Paw in lieu of purchasing an overpriced Dyson attachment. DID NOT FIT DC14 All Floors. Instead, I ended up using this with my home's Vacuflow system. It worked beautifully to remove cat hair from five cats off our white carpet. Unfortunately it only lasted a month. I plan to write to the company to express my displeasure about the quality of this product."
5,Great for pet owners!,"I got one of these with our vacuum a couple years ago, and it finally started slowing down. It works GREAT to clean stairs, so I ordered another to replace it. This is the best pet hair vacuum attachment I have ever had."
1,Lasted not even 1 full use,"I got this product and it worke wonderfully...for a whole 5 steps. then the brushes stopped turning, even though there is no blockage or anything wrong that I could tell. I dismantled the item and made sure it was clean and clear but it doesnt work any longer.If you buy this, make sure you have a good return policy. Unfortunately I bought it from a third party seller, not direct from amazon, and that option would cost me almost as much as the item itself after shipping to me and from me.Im chalking it up to a loss, but thought I would warn you."
2,Not long lasting!,"This product worked great when I first got it. It picked up cat hair great; but after a couple of uses, the power nozzle was no longer powerful, it was just suction. This was a replacement for the original one I got with the vac. The same thing happened to the original one. I would not recommend this to my friends"
5,Does the job the Dyson attachment doesn't!,I bought a Power Paw when the upholstery attachment that came with my Dyson didn't work as expected. (The darn rotary would stop every time I put it on my fabric!) The Power Paw was less than $20 and cleans EXACTLY the way I was anticipating. I have 3 cats and it cleans the cat hair off the furniture in no time. LOVE IT!
3,Works well but has a short life,"This is my third one. When new the attachment works very well. Only a cat fur tool--the masking tape type--works better on upholstery. However, the useful life of this attachment seems to be 12 to 18 months. It gradually loses suction over time, probably because the two piece clamshell design is not sealed. Since suction drives the brush, it's important in more than one way. If you have to take it apart to remove a clog it will never work the same. Even if you don't take it apart the suction still degrades. This time around I put a bead of silicone caulk over the seams to see what happens.I wish it were more durable because it works very well when it works. It gets the fur and miscellaneous stuff off curtains and upholstery."
4,"If you have the first ""How the west was lost"" ...","... you can't stay without the second one.It's really appreciable, with some pieces which are tormenting.But then, if you are a deep thinker, you'll love it."
4,More 20th Century and Native American synthesis,"Like volume 1, this is a great CD for meditation or just relaxing."
5,CABBAGE PATCH KIDS WILL LIVE FOREVER,"I LOVED CABBAGE PATCH KIDS WHEN I WAS A KID, AND I WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS DOLL FOR MY DAUGHTER!"
3,"Good value, poor design","+:1. Stainless Steel, robust2. Better price than any other models-:1. Cannot finish the bottom part of the vegetable2. Blades not sharp enough3. Thickness control not easy to adjust4. Too big in size"
3,Not sharp enough,"Although this mandoline is sturdy and fits together well (as far as changing the blades), the blades were not sharp enough when I received them to easily slice or julienne pototoes or carrots. I would think they should go through the slicer much easier than they did. I had to really bear down hard, and the slices were really choppy, rather than smooth."
2,Poor value,"I bought this last year hoping to step up from the inexpensive plastic one I had used for years. I really thought it was French. HA! Made in China and the biggest and best feature of a mandoline (it's blades) were very poor quality. Not at all sharp enough to easily slice potatoes or carrots. A dull blade is the cook's worst danger. Oh, by the way, I spent $70 and it's now $20. What a rip-off."
1,instructions not good,"I haven't used this yet, and the reason is I am having great difficulty assembling it. There is no helpful instruction on how to put these blades on, and no pictures. The instruction leaflet is uselsss! Its ok if you're a guy used to this kind of stuff, but for a widow, its impossible."
1,no good,Pros:will cut cucumberCons:won't cut anything stiffer than a cucumberstraight rather than diagonal bladejulienne cutters are a total failure
1,Bought 5 years ago and still have not used it..,"Bought this 5 years ago and still have not used it, it is too bulky and the blades are not sharp enough.. One of those bad purchases.I guess there are better technologies offered in the market today that better serves the purpose. I am giving it a a zero rating.MIU France Professional Stainless Steel Mandoline Slicer with Built-In Rotating Blades, Serrated Edge"
2,Everybody makes the occasional mistake,"Not their best album by any means, but an important one as it defined their change in direction to the electronica age. There are a few good songs on this album, but some of the B-sides to the associated singles are better. David J once said there were 29 songs written for this album with the best 10 chosen. I'm interested in hearing the other 19 as I'm certain these weren't the best 10.Anyway, the first half of the album starts OK, but doesn't 'gel' like it should. More like a collection of singles than anything else. The 2nd half is where it all falls apart as the writing just isn't there this time around, however there are some interesting sounds.Love and Rocket's 2nd attempt at electronica with the ""Lift"" album was significantly better."
3,"Looks nice, but somewhat scratchy material","The cover fit pretty well, but needs daily tucking in. Could be a bit bigger in the ""T"" area to fit our chair perfectly. Material is not soft."
3,Cotton Duck Sofa Slipcover,"The slipcover arrived quickly. The color was not what it looks like in the photo. It's more of an off-white or light tan. My sofa must be too big for the cover. It's stretched to it's limit across the back, but fits okay on the arms and seat. I'm afraid to wash it due to shrinkage. I would like to order one for my loveseat, but I'll have to think about it."
4,Miele Sirius,"Since my vacuum died, partly due to multiple not too careful users, I needed a new one. This was strongly recommended by someone who uses several different vacuums and who liked Miele best of all, due to ease of use and longevity. (the deceased lasted maybe 2 yrs) It was located easily and delivered post haste(at the price it should have come in cloth-of-gold) Stories of reliability,sturdiness, and ease of use together are the prospective trade off for the ridiculous price. On investigating, I found the entire model range has the same motor, the difference between models being features. Some of these are useful, some only costly-a matter of personal opnion and depth of pocket. That said, I thought it was particularly cheesy, this being a mid range model, that a power head is not included and must be purchased as an extra. I would feel it was cheesy even with the base model. Very bad move in my opinion."
4,Great machine; note that no basic floor tool included,"The vacuum itself is lightweight, has great power and is amazingly quiet for its performance. Note that ""NOW INCLUDES: SBB300-3 Parquet Floor Tool"" is misleading since that's the *only* floor tool included. That tool works great on bare floors, but it doesn't work at all for carpets.At this writing, if you purchase this machine and have carpets, you'll also have to purchase a floor tool that works with carpets. I ended up buying the optional turbo brush (an extra $120+) which works amazingly well for a non-electronic brush, but it wasn't a cost I had planned on. You could also get the general purpose floor tool for less that works with carpets and bare floors. After the purchase I checked other dealers who sell this model, and they state it only comes with the parquet floor tool. It would be helpful if the Amazon product description made this clear as well."
3,Not at all what I'd hoped for,"I've read several of the books about the ""Face"" on Mars and other possibly artificial Martian features and thought this would make an interesting addition.Mr. Haas discusses several Martian and Terrestrial features, and mentions the writings of other Martian Object authors such as Carlotto and Hoagland. It seems to me that, in my reading so far, that he is of the opinion that the people who did the ancient Mayan and Olmec carvings down in Central & South America also operated on Mars. Where Richard Hoagland sees pyramids or other ruins George Haas seems to keep seeing C & SA petroglyphs on a giant scale- after a few shots of that I began to loose interest in his book. I don't know what's up with Mars, I don't like NASA's take (sometimes I don't like Hoagland's either)on it but this guy is way too strong on petroglyphs I think. I may not get around to finishing the book."
2,Don't bother,"While the concept is interesting the theories included in this text are not well rooted in science. There is a lot of conjecture, and huge leaps between supposed evidence and theory. If you are examining possibilities to write a SciFi novel, it's an interesting research stop."
1,21st century goth,"Simple... Don't waste your time with this book. Hey, I'm a big fan of other Mick Mercer books, but having Mr. Mercer punch in ""Goth"" in a google search engine, then press print is complete rubbish."
5,Must have album,Quite possibly their best album . A must have for any christian metal head . Sound strikingly similar to Metallica pre black album .
5,Jaw Dropping.,"If you were there when this came out you know the feeling of having a christian album that could compete with the likes of Metallica. This thing is a monster speed metal platter with some furious playing that will have you whipping your neck around in a frenzy. And Jimmy Brown can sing, scream and reach great falsetto heights as well as anybody in the genre. As a reissue this is good, giving the songs a little more oomph though I don't like the new angel. Give me the muscled one anyday. If you were or are into the thrash sounds of the late 80's you owe it to yourself to check this out. The song, Weapons Of Our Warfare even made it onto Headbanger's Ball briefly."
2,Flesh of Frankenstein,I watched this on Amazon on demand. It was pretty goofy. The gore was unbelievable. It was more of a cut rate soft porn production than a horror movie. Dont waste your time.
3,Only for Andy Warhol fans.,"It's the old story. Frankenstein's killing, slaugthering etc. In this movie, he is married, and has children. His wife has a secret lover..... Joe D'Allesandrio. It's fun, entertaining, if you like blood, sex, violence."
4,disdisgutingly gory,"to To be totally honest, I only saw this movie once. It was in 1974 when I was 12 years old. Yes, we snuck into the theatre. I remember the warnings at the time. "" completely concerned with disgusting gory violence"" Those warnings were very true. This movie is not for those with queasy stomachs for there are a number of scenes which could make the average person puke. That is providing they are not edited out for this upcoming release. One being where Baron Frankenstein says, "" to know life, one must F... the gallbladder"" which he does after cutting open the female Frankenstein monster. The lopping off of a head with curved shears was a good one too. The fact that this movie was originally in 3D made for some good close ups of intestines and livers as well. Too bad the dvd will not be in 3d. As with most classic horrors, the acting is not deserving of any awards, but I believe that any collector of horror/gore flicks should cosider this movie."
1,What a piece of garbage,"Warhol seems to have made this drek with only two objectives in mind: to splatter gore everywhere, and to film Joe Dallesandro nude as often as possible. As titillating as these might be, neither is enough to carry this wretched film.Udo Kier's vocal cords get a tremendous workout thanks to his shouting virtually every line. He is the worst actor of the cast by far.Unless you're dying to see a bit of entrails and male nudity, skip it. Your time would be better spent banging your head against a brick wall."
1,andy warhol's dracula,This is such a poor movie that I'm sure Warhol was embarassed to have his name associated with it.
4,Frankly Funny,"I saw this in 3D ""back in the day"", 1973. It's such a hoot! Watch the version narrated by the director and learn about making films.D Man"
2,an interesting and disturbing film,"this review is for the Criterion Collection edition of the film.This film along with ""blood for dracula"" were filmed back to back in Italy. This one the more controversal of the two originally received an X rating by the MPAA. Is is based very loosely on Mary shelly's novel and follows Dr. Frankenstein creating a male and female zombie and his attempts to get them to breed.Udo Kier playing the role of Dr. Frankenstein is excelent because the actor is German and has a great German accent.The Criterion collection has audio commentary and an 18 minute slideshow with photos from the film and its production along woth an audio soundtrack of music from the film."
5,Chilling and Disturbing,"Barry Longyear's writing is often of a more dismal place, or disturbing time, but this more than most. (My vote for his best book!) This work will keep you reading and every time you stop you will ask yourself, ""Could this be? Will we live in such a world?"". The main character is an orphan of sorts, he never should have been born, in world where lottery decides who may or may not have a child. He must now make the best of his life and find his place in the plan to rescue mankind from itself..."
5,One of the great classics,"I don't have time to list all the amazing things about this book. I have been a big sci fi fan since the age of about 12 or 13, and out of the thousands of sci fi books I have read, this ranks up in the top 5. It should be required reading for everyone. The concept of whether we choose our own future, how we do that, and how we are or are not going to survive as a species, are the primary themes in the book. It is written so well that you won't want to put it down. At the same time there are things that are disturbing enough that you won't want to keep reading. What a work of art and literature."
5,Good begining book,"This is a very good beginner book on a very complex subject. By the end you will have built a few robots, and that is where all the love/hate is. The author also has a webpage where he offers advice and help with problems you may have. Personally, I am very happy with this purchase, and staying up late working on my robots...advice: Radio Shack will not have all the parts you need (he includes where to obtain parts)."
2,Not what i expected,"When the title of the book says Absolute Beginners's guide it means it. The book does a good job of explaining the history of robotics, and describing the various types. But there is a definate lack of explaination when it comes to the robots them selves. Its simply ""asseble part A with part B, then move on to C."" With no reasoning behind why you're doing it. In short the book does a poor job of teaching you robotics but instead is an exercise in how to follow directions."
2,Missing Parts,"Cute book. If you want learn about the history of robots and to learn how to make only 3 of them then this is the book for you.The part list should be revised to include all parts used and recommended. You should read the projects carefully unless you want to spend time travelling back and forth to your local electronics store. Although the projects start with a parts list, the author tends to add parts to a project in the middle of the text."
2,Only 2 Original Projects,"Of the three projects in the book, only two seem to be original. The coat hanger walker (displayed on the cover) was created by a 14 year old boy, who has generously made the plans available for free on the web."
2,Bad Jokes,"Zoinks! This book is hard to read. The material is straightforward but the author thinks that he is the next Benny Goodman. Like Benny Goodman, he never stops trying to squeeze in a joke. Unfortunately I never laughed at Benny's jokes or author's. If it weren't for the one liners, the book would be quite good. Humor is a tool best left in the hands of professionals. Perhaps the friends and family of the author can arrange an intervention.If you're under 16 years of age it's a great book. If you remember who Benny Goodman is, you're in for a frustrating time."
5,"A concise, visual exploration of DB2","This book is really rather interesting. It appears to take off where the old Don Chamerlain books ended. Don has not given us one of his tomes in quite some time (version 5, I believe) and they have been sorely missed. This book takes up that honorable tradition.DB2 is a complex and at times complicated set of software services, and needs some sort of gentle entrance guide. By not assuming that the reader is familiar with anything, and by explaining everything is a visual manner, the book assists first-timers and even those of us who are experienced to walk confidently through the excersises and learn the tasks of a DBA or new-found developer.A must read for those who need to be ""up and running"" as quickly as possible!!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book solely on the strength of the positive reviews here (stupid, I know). Unfortunately, my opinion doesn't most everyone else's. I needed a book that would give me a quick look at using DB2 SQL as an application programmer. This book devotes 1 chapter to SQL, and the information is very basic. The rest is study guide stuff (architecture, DBA stuff, etc.) that simply isn't very helpful to someone trying to learn how to actually work with the database. I come from an Oracle background, and the transition to DB2 is anything but instinctive or easy. It's a real pain, actually.If anyone knows of any good, practical DB2 books for database/ETL programmers, I would love to hear about them.Thanks,bk"
2,Not for Mainframe DB2,I should have done my homework before i bought this book. If you are using db2 on the mainframe im not sure you will find this book too helpful as it caters to windows and linux users. Im very new to db2 and did not find this book that helpful as far as laying down the basics.
5,Probably best DB2 on UNIX/Linux book out there right now,"Not alot of DB2 books out there (unlike Oracle), but the one's I have read are either very old or geared towards mainframes. This is a well organized book. Easy to read. Lots of diagrams to aid the understanding of a specific topic. Great book if your new to v8 and have been using v7 for a couple of years. Recommended."
4,Perfect,"Le regale este procesador a un amigo, quien se estaba iniciando en el mundo de los gamers, le ha funcionado perfecto y no tiene queja de el."
5,Wood Applicator for wax,My items were recieved on time and in good condition. I would reccomend buying from this seller
4,Spatulas are as good as can be expected.,"These are wide and sturdy. I'm not sure what to compare them to since this is my first time to buy wax application spatuIas. I can't say I ""love"" it so I gave it 4 stars."
2,Contractual Obligation?,"There is no real need for a Yazbek collection considering that he only made three albums. This CD clocks in at only 40 minutes and is missing some of his best songs. Where's Black Cowboys On The Beach, Fight The One Armed Man and You Are Here? It is not, as its name implies, a collection of home demos. It must be an obligation to the record label.Just buy the albums Laughing Man, Tock and Damascus.[DW]"
1,The Old Bait & Switch,"I ordered 3-D Ultra ""Maximum"" Minigolf, what I was sent was the oldest version called 3-D Ultra Minigolf! It doesn't have a ""Course Architect to create custom courses"", or ""Real-world courses"" as the Features described! What a rip-off! My son was really disappointed, not to mention it's fraudulent to falsely represent something!"
1,What a drag,My wife nagged me for this bag for months. We finally made the spend and received it. It lasted about 4 months before the seems came apart and fabric began faying. It is pretty clear that this is a decorative bag meant for moms to look cool vs. moms who actually use their diaper bag on a day-to-day basis.
1,They NEVER last - return them when they burn out!,"I made the mistake of installing these under my cabinets and the bulbs barely last one year.$10/bulb/year? That's a complete rip-off.I bought mine at Home Depot, so when they burn out I return them for replacement. So far that's worked pretty well.At HD the complete 3-light installation kit is usually the same price - or even cheaper! - than 3 bulbs, so I just buy the installation kit instead of the bulbs. Then 6 months down the road when I've collected 3 burned-out bulbs I swap them back into the installation kit and return the kit for a new one with three fresh bulbs.Sure, that's an ethically questionable practice - but so is labeling these bulbs ""10,000 hours"" when they barely last 1000."
1,very short bulb life,"Two bulb set, one bulb allready burned out, I calculated three months and about five hours a day, 400-500 hours is all it lasted, I'm not sure about Utilitech products."
2,can't find replacements,"Purchased at lowes, they do not carry replacement bulbs, I finally found them on amazon, they seem to burn out often as opposed to their claim that the bulbs last 10,000. I am disappointed"
1,Dont ever buy,They are the worst you pay more for the replacement bulb than the whole works!! AND no one sales the bulbs!!!!
4,not a bad product,"I have owned these lights for over 3 years now. Yes, it is irritating that the store you buy them from (Lowes) doesn't sell the replacement bulb, but they can easily be found on the web. Amazon's price is too high for the bulb only. You can buy them many places for only 7.50 or so. They last a long time, however, they do not last the 10,000 hours that the manufacture claims. A very inexpensive product to purchase, easy to install. Buy the bulbs in bulk online and problems solved!"
1,Feit Electric Puck Lights Are Junk,Bought three of these in a kit and two of them shorted out almost immediately. More Chinese-made junk. Avoid this brand.
1,"Bulbs DO NOT last 10,000 hours","Not only do these bulbs not last 10,000 hours, you will not be able to find replacement bulbs for less than the price of a brand new fixture. Ridiculous! What a waste of time and money."
1,Poor fixture,"I purchased three of these 3 light undercounter sets. In less than 6 months, three of the nine bulbs have failed. These sets were purchased at Lowe's and they do NOT stock replacement bulbs. I have had to purchase additional one-light fixtures just for the bulbs. When I contacted FEIT, the manufacturer/distributor, I was told the bulbs were available on Amazon.com. I looked, and the bulbs cost more than the replacement fixtures at Lowes! Buy something else!"
1,Don't buy them,"These things came with my house so I had no choice. My experience is the same as the other reviewers here. The bulbs last far fewer than 10,000 hours and Lowes does not have replacement bulbs. I called the company who said that Lowes will finally start stocking the bulbs ""soon"" (June 23, 2010). But they are so expensive and burn out so soon that I have decided to replace the fixtures with something more reliable. The customer service rep told me that I could get a free bulb if I mailed back the old bulb with my receipt. Of course, I have to box it up, drive to the post office, pay for shipping, ..... I'll go next time to a lighting dealer and get something that works."
1,Don't buy these lights!,I purchased these lights from Lowe's initially and found as many others did that you can not buy replacement bulbs. You have to purchase a new package of three with all the wiring. I ordered these again throught this distributor because they were slightly cheaper but I intend to replace all my lights eventually when I can afford to put in something that will last. These go out WAY to often!
2,Not enough to go on,"Ms. Zayles adds this book to several others like it (Fitness for Dummies and Complete Idiot's Guide to Fitness). I would recommend Fitness for Dummies to someone trying to understand the fitness world and start a fitness program (even one completely at home). There's just too much left out of Ms. Zayles book for it to really start someone out. There are some useful exercises and charts in this book, but their benefit is balanced by the strange product endorsements found throughout. As only one example, Ms. Zayles puts an obscure, ""passive"" product called ""Burke Spencer's Leg and Butt Buster"" right next to stationary bikes and aerobic dancing as an option for cardio workouts. This tactic certainly made me lose faith in the honesty and accuracy of her assessments."
4,I'm enjoying it,"I read the book from cover to cover before starting any program. I liked the pictures and discriptions of what muscles are being worked in the exercises. I purchased the Burke Spencer Personal Trainer (now call the Fitness Partner) and I enjoy using it with my leg routines. (I also happen to use it for my kickboxing routine since I don't have a punching bag.) It does take awhile to get use to. In the two months I've been on it I've lost 5 inches, 7 lbs and built muscles I didn't even know I had. I like the yoga and kickboxing sections because whether I'm on her outlined program or creating one of my own I have all the tools I need currently to get started. I would recommend a second book for reference because no one book has everything you want/need."
4,Good purchase,"Excellent quality, nicely made, sturdy band. I would have gladly paid a bit more for a tiiiiiny bit bigger diamond. Alternatively, sticking to the same stone, I would have enjoyed seeing it being placed a bit more up. You see, I knew what to expect, but my major ""complaint"" is that the diamond is a bid ""buried"" between the two legs.Still, I would buy it again.Last note: it is a ring where getting the right size is very very important. I buy some of my rings a size bigger (for the sake of convenience). This is the first ring were a size bigger was annoying. The band is too wide for such experiments."
4,Beautiful,"This ring is beautiful, I love it. The only thing is that it was bigger than I expect so I returned it and made a new order for one smaller size which fits great. The ring looks nice, just what I was looking for!!!"
1,Waste of time,"This is a video that makes little sense and goes on and on. The guy acts like a jerk and over simplifies intrapersonal relationships. If anyone acted the way he did in a work place they would be terminated. Screaming, yelling, and making stupid faces, I thought these things got left behind in kindergarten. If he came up to me and began yelling and poking at me, I would have to warn him about boundaries he is crossing."
5,EVERY SURVEYOR SHOULD HAVE THIS BOOK!,"THE SECTION ON ALTA SURVEYS IS MOST COMPLETE. TITLE COMPANYS ARE GETTING SO TOUGH DEAL WITH IN THIS AREA, WE ALL NEED THIS VALUABLE HELP. GURDON WATTLES DOES A NICE JOB ON THIS BOOK."
3,Predictable story line,"I bought this because my book club was reading ""The Snow Child"" by Ivey, and the folktale was an integral part of the story. The author mentioned this story in her acknowledgments, so I thought it would be fun to share.This story was disappointing -- very basic and predictable. Not the complex folk tale read by the character and played out in the novel.I've since posted it on a book swapping site."
4,Not For Everybody Though,Not For Everybody Though.... Sakura Diaries is sorta like a dating game (aka Cannon). The only diffeence is theres adult script content; in terms of story for age age group appeal and of course there is a bit of fanservice. Some may be totally off by it. Best advice get one loose of the DVD's before you commit to the Box Set. Overall I did find Sakura Diaries highly enjoyable and refreshing in some sense.
3,"interesting, but overkill","The storyline, while on the surface, is not much more than your average boy-meets girl-the meets girl from his past love triangle, isn't too bad- it actually features some moral dilemmas and shows everyone involved acting like idiots at times. The animation is well-done and expressive, and the transfer to DVD is pretty good.However, the collectors edition (and I'll assume the series itself has some flaws)- the Japanese dub is awful at times....some voices really do sound like something from ""The Chipmunks."" also, the CE has ALOT of fanservice, moreso than the original DVDs of the series. Alot. Let me repeat that. Alot of fanservice. It's funny at first, but it does wear very thin after the first few episodes.Those two things kept this from getting 4 stars, or maybe even 5. I won't out & out reccomend the movie, but you could do much worse."
2,wtf!?!?!,"I don't really know what I was expecting coming into this anime, but it was just plain wierd. They were fu**ing cousins man. WTF? The end was just so, not there. There didn't seem to be an ending, so much as the episodes just stopped. Really, there is only one word that can descride this anime: Weak."
4,"Average Show, but Good Value","Sakura Diaries revolves around three characters. Urara loves Touma, but Touma wants to date Mieko. Mieko will only data a college student, so Touma crams for the entrance exams while pretending to already be in college. The story is far more serious than anime like Tenchi and Ranma.This series was originally released as 4 DVDs. It was later discovered that two versions of the show existed, so ADV decided to release the second version as a box set. The material in this version is a little more risque than the original (i.e. it's not for kids). ADV redid the subtitles for this release, and by all accounts, the new subtitles are more accurate. However, there is no English dub on this version. If you hate subtitles, this release isn't for you. If subtitles don't bother you, this is a great value--you get over 4 hours of animation."
4,You won't see this on TOONAMI...at any hour,"I already owned ""Sakura Diaries 1"" when this collector set became available, so the story was familiar to me. What I wasn't ready for was the emotional ride the remainder of the series put me through. The characters present infatuation, love, and lust in the extreme. I found myself asking, ""What ... is wrong with the lead male in this story?"" After viewing the final disk, I was upset, not because I was disappointed. The story has actually made me think. If you want a DVD that's fun, I recommend you look at another series. This is a serious story."
3,Not as pictured,"Everyone knows and loves Cabbage Patch Kids. They are adorable! However, I was surprised that the doll I received looked nothing like the one pictured on Amazon (she had really curly hair instead of straight hair like the picture). I didn't think about the fact that they are all different! Just be aware that the doll you receive may not look like what you expect."
2,This toy is too loud,"[...]Read This Loud-Toy ListHere are toys sampled by researchers and their sound in decibels when measured approximately one inch from the speaker. Although you don't need to toss them, do make sure your child plays with them at arm's length.Cabbage Patch Kids Babies: 91 decibels"
5,Not my kind of movie....BUT,"Heart-tugger. Not my usual, but the plot is emotionally engaging, the people are very well drawn, and the landscape itself becomes a character in the story. The acting is top-notch all around, including several well-known Indian actors like Tantoo Cardinal, Ned Romero, the lovely Irene Bedard, and Michael Greyeyes, who went on to star in the PBS adaptation of Tony Hillard's ""Skinwalkers."" (It is always good to see Indian actors hired to play Indian roles.) And of course, Mercedes Ruehl gets a chance in this movie to play a warm and hopeful role that she truly nails. 100% Family movie, safe for kids and your mother-in-law."
4,The Lost Child,"If you enjoy a feel good movie, if you have a real interest in Native American culture, this is a movie for you to see. All the actors did a fine job. I will see this more than once."
4,Back to Navajoland.,"This is a good story, with much depth. About a womam who finds out where she finally belongs, and convinces her husband and children to adapt to their new found family, her Navajo family, which they do eventually,after many setbacks and heartsearching. Beautiful scenery, which does look like the Navajo Reservation in Arizona. Hopefully it is. I enjoyed this dvd very much. M.O.Australia."
5,A since of home...,"For me this story is two side because I work with the Navajo and I am an adopted child myself. I did not learn until I was grown that when my birth mother ""placed"" me for adoption, she had been told to either give me up or they would forcefully take me...and I'm white! I contect very deep with Becks and feel in many ways her store is much my own story. I say it is a must watch...especially if you are adopted."
2,Nice flashlights if you can get passed the smell,"These seem like decent flashlights for the price, but the rubber on them absolutely smells horrible and the smell stays on your hands until you wash them.I don't know why the rubber smells, I am currently trying to ""air them out"", but if the smell persists, I will end up throwing them away."
3,After Dark,"I was a little disappointed in how the book looked when I recieved it. It had quite a few wrinkles & folds throughout the pages & the cover itself. When I ordered it, it had said the book was in GOOD shape but, I would not say it was in GOOD shape at all. To be fair I would say maybe, FAIR shape should've been what was posted...."
5,"Loved it, Loved it, LOVED IT!","If you love romantic suspense, then this book is for you. I could NOT put it down! I'm eagerly awaiting Beverly's next romantic suspense, EVERY MOVE SHE MAKES, which is coming out in September 2001."
5,Another good book by Beverly Barton.,I chose this book because all the Beverly Barton books I had read thus far were great and I expected as much from this one. I was not disappointed.
3,Not Barton's best,"I love Beverly Barton. There really hasn't been a book by her I haven't liked. However, out of all her books I have read I like this one the least. I felt like the book was very predictable for one. Also, the love story in this one is very cheesy. I sometimes feel embarrassed for the couple in this book at how cheesy they come across.If you are looking for a good Barton murder/suspense/romance you should read ""What She Doesn't Know"". That was a far better book."
4,Great Read,"This was my first book by this author, and I can't wait to read more by her! The story was exciting and kept you turning the pages until the very end. The characters were interesting, although Lane's smothering did get tiring after awhile. And while the killer's identity really wasn't a surprise, there was enough suspense to keep you guessing until the very end."
5,after dard,I received my book in the time quoted and the condition of the book was in excellent condition. I would recommend all readers to consider purchasing books this way.
2,Ho Hum!,"I'm usually a Beverly Barton fan but I found this outing to be extremely disappointing. It was just boring! The characters never really come to life. Although, we are told over and over again, about the type of people they are. I never really believed it. Johnny Mack was the tortured hero and Lane the heroine. Their son, Will, acted entirely too old for 14 years old. My advise - skip this one and read one of her shorter books."
1,After Dark Dud,"I haven't read this author previously and the book was a disappointment. I will not reiterate the plot as it is well synopsed by previous reviewers. The mystery of who done it and the shocking ""secret"" were blatantly obvious by the first 100 pages. I read the end to confirm my hunches and tossed the book. The book is a series of cliches, the sex was sleazy, the language grating at times, and the atmosphere non- existent. The author would do well to read early Sandra Brown and Tami Hoag for suspenseful, sultry, southern mystery."
1,Not for a true mystery reader,"This book was a real disappointment to me. I am proud to be a southerner, but the people in this book are portrayed to be sweltering sexaholics. I enjoy my mysteries as more mystery than romance. You can see the ""secrets"" coming way too early and there are not enough suspects to keep you guessing until the end. However, if you enjoy mindless drivel served up as ""romantic suspense"" this book is for you. My copy will be waiting for you at the local used book store."
1,Not even worth the low price,"I bought this as a gift, after having some great success with other Nvie items. The ribbon on this necklace is frayed in many places and it just looks cheap. Since it was so inexpensive, I didn't think it was worth trying to return it."
1,Waste of money,Not sure what it does or what value it bringsAfter I used it the maintenance required light in my Toyota rav 4 came up. Stay away
1,advertisement BS,Ad says on sale for $6.99 with $3.50 savings and you an buy any day for $6.99 at ther suppliers
3,Cute collection of songs and animation,"This is a cute video. It's a collection of songs, loosely related, that together tell the story of how a boy who first thinks that a spider is gross, comes to be his friend. The songs are sung by a male vocalist and accompanied rather nicely on guitar. None are really memorable, but all are pleasant and rather playful. I thought my four year old might get bored with the video, but he watched it from beginning to end (it's about an hour long)--and, while it's not his favorite, he occasionally asks for it. I suspect kids who are much older (say 7 or up), might tire of it more easily. At any rate, this is a nice alternative for parents looking for a break from the usual frantic super-hero stuff."
1,Doesn't Exist,"A ploy by Sierra to get all of us...to play TFC... well... if you play TFC now, its everything TF2 was suppose to be. They kept patching it, until it is now TF2. Its retarted. It very well does not exist. And if it does, I remember telling my friend how amazing it was going to be when I was in 8th grade. We use to talk about this upcoming game, which we were blood thirsty for.... I'm finishing my first semester of college this year...TF2 can stay in the minds of the Sierra, because this gamer, doesn't care much for TF2....PS: TF2 Technology, MRX and all of that great stuff? well... its been surpassed... sorry guys!!"
1,Never coming out!,Team Fortress 2 will never come out. So dont get your hopes up on this game. Get your hopes up on Unreal 2003 and Doom 3
2,Mom does not use it.,I followed the OT recommendation and order the weighted spoon for my 84 year old mother who has Essential Tremor. She said that it did not help getting the food to her mouth.and that the additional weight made her tired while eating.
5,The best substitution chord book,Excellent text.This is Sal Salvador masterwork. His explanations about extensions and substitutions are clear and there are lots of exercises. It goes quite well as a companion to Mickey Baker's classic text or Johnny Rector's Encyclopedia of Chord Progressions. Recommended.
1,"WRONG ALBUM, AMAZON!","These comments pertain to the excellent indie rock band the Black Angels, not this putrid screamo crapfest of a band Black Angel."
3,Burn Marks,I ordered 2 dogs from this vendor and both had 2 to 3 burn marks through out the body. I looks like they are burn marks from the manufacturing process to singe some the the seams together.
5,This puppy made my niece very happy,"This puppy was very durable and soft (which is what I was hoping for). It was also life-like. My niece fell in love with my son's cavalier king charles puppy (a real one), and I thought this stuffed animal would make a nice substitute since I couldn't get her a real dog. She was very grateful and loves it."
3,"Good for it's genre, but lacking in overall musical scheme","First and foremost, I have enjoyed FFH's music since their very first album. I had just became a Christian and it greatly helped me to approach my newfound Savior. None of their albums have touched me like that one but this album is very good pop, and that is odd coming from me as I am not a pop music fan. In it's genre, FFH stand as one of the very best, both with their beautiful harmonies and stick to your head melodies, yet in a Christian music scene that is growing in many ways it just cannot hold it's own. From the rugged and organic sounds of Bebo Norman and Michael Mcdonald, the incredible musicianship of caedmon's call, and the coolness of Third Day, I find myself drifting farther away from the FFH influence and in more adventurous territory. yet, for the moment, this is a very uplifting and fun album to kick back and listen to at the end of a tough day, as it constantly reminds one of the Father and His love."
4,My latest Merry book,"This is a pretty good Merry Gentry book overall. There are some good twists and turns. A good book, as long as you have read the rest of the series."
4,Was good but not her best,This book was a very good filler. After reading it and realizing that nothing was resolved in any way it felt more like the second movie in a trilogy. Sets you up for the next installment but doesn't give you anything just yet to sink your teeth into.But as far as fillers go-oh wow!
3,Not Free SF Reader,"It is not just the packet of life savers five fruits colored Sidhe bodyguards that the princess has to romp around with, you can add goblins into the mix as well. Those goblin types like eating people too, so this can be a little problematic.Then there is the whole possed by powerful Sidhe god types, as well. This could all really leave one woman sore."
2,if you like this sort of thing ...,"i can't really add much to what the other less-than-positive reviewers have said. i'm not sure which is worse -- the sex in the previous books or the gore in this one. there's way too much description of the chippendale-model men with the ridiculous outfits and hair and eyes, all of whom are attracted to merry (who now apparently channels a goddess). i think what i like about the books is that they amuse me; they are clearly wish-fulfillment for the author, so i keep reading them."
3,The lack of plot is disturbing,"I give this book 3 stars because I love Laurell K Hamilton, Merry Gentry, and the other two books in the series a great deal and just can't bear to give her 1 star. That said..if you like a book that's just one baby step away from porn and don't care about plot, go for it!The first 2/3 of the book really have no plot whatsoever. It's mostly sex, kinky sex, power-sex, and more sex. I could forgive that if the last 1/3 of the book hadn't been so good..we finally get some plot, some mystery, some deductive reason, all the stuff we love in a Merry novel.I won't give it away but the ending of the book left you sitting in your chair saying ""What?"" It seemed like there should have been a lot more to that book than what there was.So, it gets 3 stars...the average of 5 stars for the last 1/3 of the book and and 1 star for the first 2/3.It was probably the most disappointing Laurell K Hamilton I've ever read made worse by the fact that I waited so long for it."
3,Wait for Paperback,"Ok, I am a huge Laurell fan and have read both series over and over again. I pre-ordered this book before it was even released and I was so excited to get it in the mail. It took me less than 2 days to read and I agree with a few other reviews that it was confusing and winded in the first three quarters of the book. I still love all the characters and will continue to read the rest of the series but Laurell if you read these reviews, PLEASE MAKE THE BOOKS LONGER! This one could have had way more added to the story like the trip to the Goblin court or a trip to the Seelie Court. For $36 Canadian, I expected more. I look forward to the next Anita. A recommended read but don't rush to buy it."
2,"No story progression, nothing new","I was eagerly looking forward to the progression of Merry Gentry's life--unfortunately Seduced by Moonlight did absolutely nothing towards this end. More sex than you ever wanted to read about, more cruelty in the UnSeelie Court. The book leaves you feeling like about 3 days have passed between its pages. Just not a lot of content, and leaves me wondering if I'll bother with the next book."
2,Another Disappointment,"I am a longtime fan of Laurell K. Hamilton's work. Her Anita Blake series was entertaining, thought-provoking, and sexy. Unfortunately, Ms. Hamilton's latest books seem to have descended into softporn, where the sex scenes are the reason for the plot and not the other way around. I seem to spend all my time waiting for the story to get started, getting instead steadily more exotic sex. If you're looking for another work up the level of say, Guilty Pleasures, pass this book by; if you're looking for soft porn, buy and enjoy."
1,Ugh!,"I do not know what book everyone is reading because the Laurell K. book that I read was awful. I was so excited to get this book. I went home and curled up on the couch and read up to page 136 and started shaking my head. My husband asked, ""is the book any good?"" My response? I usually only give a book 50 pages. If it hasn't grabbed me I get rid of it. I read a lot and I don't have time to let a writer ""slowly"" pull me in. At page 136 this book had not only not grabbed me, it was boring me and I was having a hard time concentrating. I have read every book that Laurell has written. This and the last Anita book have been very disappointing to me. I will still read her, but I may not be as eager to pick the book up off the shelf and buy it."
2,Third strike your out!,The first two books in this series had a plot which was actually interesting. This book should b a short story in Playboy. No plot. Overly sexualized. Which is usually good but even the sex sucks!
3,More of the same,"and less of what it could be. The Merry series has become little more a Black Lace Erotica novel in hardback. The only plot seems to be how to get Merry into bed with more men. I shudder at the thought. If you've enjoyed the new direction of Laurell K Hamilton's writing, then you'll enjoy Seduced by Moonlight. At least it has fewer typos and misspelled words than her last few novels."
3,Another small step downhill for LKH,"This is a library / loaner, not a must-buy. LKH still has the ability to grab attention, and make the reader want to see the next page. So 3 stars, not 2. But the surprises, drama, and sense of action are getting lost in a lot of stuff about goblin, sidhe, and demi-fey social conventions. Some of the plot twists just aren't convincing - if x is so powerful, and has been for so long, how could he/she/it be open to that trick now? Alas, LKH seems to be losing control of the complexity of her characters and plots. This book adds to the trend of more & bigger weird powers, more (talk about)odd sex, at the expense of a compelling story. For fans of Merry, go ahead, read it once, and move on. For others who want to see a better example of LKH's capability as a writer, start with Guilty Pleasures."
3,Disappointing but probably necessary,"Like many of the above reviewers, I rushed to get this book and then was disappointed. The entire book takes place in about 2 days and went from confusing to disjointed back to confusing for me. I've enjoyed almost all of the Anita books and the first 2 about Merry so feel I've put in my time with Hamilton. I think this book is probably necessary as a device to set up the rest of the series and we have to get this info somewhere if it's going to matter later. It's not even as introspective as it probably should be as merry just rolls from event to event without telling us how she feels about any of this. And the addition of the new guards got very annoying-I actually had to make a list to keep them straight. (Descriptions of Frost and Barinthus were intriguing.) I was comfortable with the earlier group but this was too many except for the CAT! Anyway--I held on and will wait for the next--but will probably wait for my area library to get it."
3,Now we're getting going...,"This series is a lot slower read than her Anita Blake books, but by this third book, you finally start to care about the characters and what happens next. Looking forward to book 4."
4,I love it,"Regardless of the negative reviews that I have read, I found that I really enjoyed the book."
4,Seduced by Moonlight,"This was an excellent book, it picked up in the series very well and was a true page turner. I couldn't put it down from the moment it arrived in the mail. If like the Meredith Gray series definitly pick up this book and give yourself some free time because you won't be able to stop once you start."
3,OK - but not as good as previous 2,"Merry Fans - what a let down! I've always liked Merry better than Anita Blake because of the steamy loves scenes, but in this book Laurell K. Hamilton introduces a new lover every five minutes! The descriptions of the Fey men began to run together and all I could think as I read was, ""Gimme more Doyle & Frost!"" They're in there - but it seems once Merry breaks a guy in we never get another well written love scene with them. It's always - 'and later...'Ok - that's not all these books are about, and the first two did a better job at having a story outside Merry's bedroom; not so here. This title offers a few, luke warm scenes and then finnaly gets going almost at the end when they group goes back to Fairy.I;m hoping the next one is better......"
2,Disappointing to say the least,"I enjoy the first books Laurell K. Hamilton wrote, the first Anita Baker stories. I read Cerulean Sins again, because I needed something to read and couldn't remember the plot. It's okay, not bad. Then 2 days later I found the Seduced by Moonlight in the bookstores. Halfway through I had to check the cover and make sure I hadn't picked up the Cerulean Sins book again. Some of the dialog was Exactly the same. The ""Take one for the team"" phrase. Even some of the sex scene's looked like cut and paste.I say again I really liked the first books and look forward to more. I'd rather wait 2 years between books to get more substance, though. Like the other readers, though I'll check it out of the library before I buy it."
1,Absolutely Awful Book!,"Laurell K. Hamilton has completely lost whatever talent she had. Her Anita Blake books continue to decline. And this latest Merry Gentry book is the worst. No story, no action, no plot, no personalites - nothing! Do not spend any money on this book. If you feel compelled to check it out (which I obviously did) check it out of the library! That's what I did. I vowed to never spend another dime on a Laurell Hamilton book even if I can't resist the temptation to check out her latest release. She once had a good imagination and could write a semi-decent story. Maybe she'll 'recover her power' and write another good book - someday. But this book is NOT it!"
1,"Same s---, different title.","OK, I was almost reconciled to the sex-for-plot substitution. Almost. Both the Anita Blake and Merry Gentry books have headed down that path. But this time, I was more distracted by the annoying overuse of a couple of metaphors / similes involving having the moon inside someone, making them ""glow"". I think this was used several times in the same scene. At least in the same chapter. Hello, proofreaders and editors? Other faux pas were equally annoying, and made reading painful.When these books, starting with Anita Blake, caught my attention, they had plot, characters, snappy dialogue, and did I mention plot? If the entire Merry story arc were a week, this book would be a minute. Almost nothing happens to advance the plot, and it happens slowly.I won't be springing for a hardcover next time. Maybe not even a paperback <sigh>. I hate it when a good thing ends badly. As a friend said, ""When the story is over, stop telling it."" Please."
2,This Seduction is a Snooze,"This book is a very disappointing effort. Laurell Hamilton's two previous Meredith Gentry books were sometimes impressively imaginative, witty and erotic. All that seems to have disappeared from Seduced By Moonlight. Only at the very end of the book, maybe the last 50 pages or so (I'm guessing and in no mood to research how thin a section of book it was) does anything worth reading happen. None of the activity promised at the end of book two, except for the brief return to the Unseelie Court, takes place. We have to wait a few more years, apparently, to move Merry a week into the future. Pretty boring. And annoying. I hope Ms. Hamilton isn't turning into another one of those horribly frustrating authors who write multiple-volume novels where nothing happens for volumes and years. I don't think most readers will stick around that long."
3,Very unsatisfying,"I found this book to be very unsatisfying. Most of it contained descriptions of rooms, places, dreams, people, but the action didn't take the reader much beyond the previous book. The only thing that really happened is that Merry defended herself once again at her aunt's court, acquired a total of 16 lovers and perhaps or perhaps not became immortal. The book was short for the time it takes for the next one to be published and lacked the sexual and sensual parts that we have come to expect from this series. Sex was mostly metaphysical and the little ""real"" sex that took place was not as exciting as in the other two books in this series. On the one hand this would have been a welcome surprise if there had been more substance to the rest of the book, but without sex and with almost no story the book left me disappointed considering that I waited a year for it to arrive."
1,Total waste of reading time,"What a disappointment to LKH fans, no story line, nothing making sense just sex and that poorly done. Best of the book was the last couple of chapters but what a waste of money to buy a hardback to enjoy 10-15 min. of reading time. Defininatly the last one of hers I buy new."
1,Getting Worse,"The first book in this series caught my interest. I managed through the second one and I couldn't even finish the third.What happen to the story line?Why is there more than two sex scenes per chapter? It is too much. I undertstand the character's need to reproduce, but common on! And it's not even with one or two characters, it is with almost a dozen! What happened to character dynamics?Her earlier novels I couldn't put down. Her latest novels have been a great disappointment and I hesitate to waste my money on such garbage."
2,You Need a Chart for the Characters,"Maybe I made a mistake starting with a book that's 3rd in a series without reading the earlier ones first. I gave it up at page 118 as I just couldn't get engaged by the characters.My previous experience with the Anita Blake series led me to this book hoping for a gutsy heroine and lots of action. There is action and descriptions of odd characters with extra eyes and magic skills. Guess I didn't make it to the sexy parts, as they mostly were talking about it, trying to be lyrical, but somehow the characters weren't coming alive for me so I gave it up.I didn't want to pan this book entirely, knowing Laurell Hamilton's abilities, she might pull it together, but I just wasn't willing to keep soldiering on hoping for a turn around."
2,"Sex, Sex, Sex, and Guess what? More Sex","I am a big fan of the Anita series and the Merry series, but instead of the twisting plots of earlier books... the only twisting going on is different bodies having sex.I don't feel that this book advanced Merry's story very much. There was a bit of character development, but that isn't enough to sustain a novel."
2,Sex...filler...sex...filler...sex...DUEL...sex...end,This was a let down from the other two stories in the series. In the two previous books there was actual plot. This one is just a lot of explaining about the laws of the Faerie Kind and then lots of sex but nothing else. I kept turning the pages waiting for forward story movement. And there was nothing. And Merry's life arc is coming perilously close to Anita's as she takes more people under her wing each book and gains bright new and shiny powers each book.Fine we know the Fey are very open about sex. I don't care about sex. Let everyone have sex! Just also let there be some kind of story that makes it worth my while. Where's Cel? Isn't Merry a detective? Why doesn't she solve cases? There was so much good set up in the previous books that this one sadly wastes.
4,good read,"If you are a Tudor Dynasty fan, then this is a watered down version book. It has plots, murder, and sex. Its not as involved but it has fantasy and is an easy read."
4,exciting but very sexual,"This series much like the Anita Blake series is exciting, well written, and captivating. However, the one thing that has really disappointed me *as it did in the anita blake series* is all the constant sex. I dont mind sensual books, occasional love scenes, or even a little raunchiness now and then but I feel like its getting to the point where the books are more and more about the sex the main characters are having and not about the actual characters themselves. Also the two series' are almost too much alike in the way that they are written at times. There are comments or even complete excerpts that resemble each other to the point where you could interchange them and barely tell a difference. I am compelled to finish the series and this disappointment is not enough to keep me from reading on but it will make me think twice before i read the next hamilton written series."
4,Great!,"I thought the book was great! A lot of people complain about the r rated scenes in the book, but is is an ADULT book. If I wanted to read a book where the most exiting thing to happen sexually was a stolen kiss i'd have picked up a book from the twilight section. I thought a lot of important things happened in this book with meredith standing up to Andias. Great book, can't wait for the next one!"
4,Pleasant and engaging,"I read A KISS OF SHADOWS and A CARESS OF TWILIGHT first and thoroughly enjoyed those. And while I did like SEDUCED BY MOONLIGHT, it wasn't quite what I expected. Though well written and paced enjoyably, there was a little too much background info for me, as though the author thought the reader might not have read the others in the series. While that intention is good and sometimes correct, I just felt it could have been shortened. That said, this was still an excellent read and much better than most of the other stuff out there! Would also recommend another book I recently enjoyed very much, though with an entirely different subject matter--THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD by Jackson McCrae. It was an excellent read and very well written also. Thanks!"
1,Read the print edition; skip the recorded version,"If you love the Merry Gentry series, stick with the print edition on this one. Some idiots at Brilliance Audio cast a thin-voiced, 50-something with the acting charm of a bored librarian to read a deliciously naughty first person novel about a sexy princess in her early thirties. What were they thinking? The reader is SO BAD that it ruins the experience of a wonderful book. Skip the recorded edition - the print edition is much livelier and more fun!"
1,awful,"those who enjoyed this book keep asking why readers keep purchasing these books if we are opposed to all the sex. the answer is simple....we are hoping eventually laurell will come to her senses and start putting out books of the same calaber of the first 7 or 8 anita blake books or the first merry books. too many readers have noticed the downward spiral of both of these series. just because we dislike the constant barage of sex doesnt make us a bunch of prudes. the thing i have enjoyed about the earlier books is getting to know the characters without dropping their drawers and exposing their genitals upon introduction. the readers who have been along for the ride since early anita can heave a sigh and remember the good old days of action, suspense, and many pages of fully clothed characters."
2,Disapointing except as soft porn,"As a devoted fan of Laurell K Hamilton, I ordered this as soon as it came out. While her books have always had a sensual edge that adds to the atmosphere, and the Merry Gentry book more than most, this takes it beyond. I suppose that there was a plot, but it was put to the background as the books concentrates on Merry having sex with basically everything in sight. Still an interesting book, but strictly as a person who wants to follow the adventures of Merry Gentry. Overall, disapointing."
2,frustrated,Frustrated because Hamilton is a decent writer but this book did not showcase her talent (as the last Anita Blake book did not). And is it just me or is Merry turning into another Anita?I wish the author could give us meatier stories. Buying her expensive hardcover books is becoming a little hard to swallow.
2,Too much sex not enough story,"First I'll admit I like the Anita Blake series better. But I enjoyed the first two books in this series and the first two chapters in this book. Somewhere after those first chapters the story line dissapeared into Merry's sex life. It was all fluff no story. The men are beautiful, strong, magical, they haven't had sex in years, they get to have sex with Merry, we got that in the first two books - now give us a plot, action, suspense. The sex captured our interest in the first books but it's not enough to hold us for much longer. As a previous review stated, I'll check the next one out of the library before I write off Merry or spend money on it."
1,Possibly the worst book I have ever read,"This is by far the worst LKH book I have read and possibly the worst book I have ever read! While the past two Merry Gentry books have been somewhat interesting and entertaining, this one is nothing but soft-core porn that is incredibly boring and repititive. If I read how somebody's skin glowed or sparkled one more time I may have vomitted. And the ending - at first I thought that my copy was missing a chapter. It just ends! You're left wanting the time back that you spent reading this awful book. I used to be a LKH fan - but no longer."
3,Must be setting the stage for the next book.,"The latest Laurell K. Hamilton ""Seduced by Moonlight"" I'd give 3 Stars. It is interesting enough. The characters are developing a little more with their new powers (set only a month after the Nameless event) and her relationship with the Queen improves. There are several lengthy descriptions of new character attributes. But nothing major happens until the end of the book, then its over. It, more or less, seems this book is just setting the stage for the next, rather than having any major events in itself. I began to feel a little disappointed when I had only 30 pages to go and the story was just picking up.If the next one is a year in coming and doesn't show more progress, I could be a very old woman before Merry has a breakthrough."
2,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of Hamilton. But with that caveat, this was by far the weakest of the three Merry books (and of all of the Anita Blake books). Nothing much happens until the last 80 pages. The first half of the book is one sex/magic scene after another and really drags - it could have been condensed into two or three chapters. The second Merry book left off with the impending visit to the Seelie Court, and yet Hamilton cannot even get Merry there in the third book.Perhaps Hamilton has bitten off more than she can chew what with writing two series at the same time. This book suffered from some of the same infirmities as the last Anita Blake book (e.g. weak on plot, using sex as a filler, and too short). Here is hoping for better in the future."
1,Written by a 14 year old?,"One of the most poorly written, pointless and boring fantasy novels I've ever had the pleasure of not finishing. Even the ""steamy"" eroticism (if you want to call it that) is hopelessly uninteresting. I can't believe this yawner ever got published! Don't waste your time or your money with this tripe."
3,95% Raunchy Sex 5% Actual Plot,"There was almost no plot in this book whatsoever. I've read all of Hamilton's books so far, and they all start out relatively normal and turn into 999/1000 pages of sex or sex-related activity. what little plot this book actually contained was a few pages in the beginning and very very rushed and poorly written few chapters (still laced with sex, though) at the end.If you really like all that stuff, then its a great book. However, if you, like me, miss Ms. Hamilton's interesting stories that contain PLOTS (however gory they may be), I wouldn't really suggest this book."
2,"Yep, and another bites the dust","*Cringes*I after Incubus Drams I swore to myself that I would never buy another. But I broke my own promise, and like a junkie. I took that inevitable 'hit' always searching for a glamourous tatse of the first few (the first five books of the Anita Blake series), and of course this one fell short.It was so boring, the summaries of these books promise some serious metaphysical (...) whoopins. But what we ended up with was a bad preternatural soap opera. Come'on Meredith, are you the future queen or a fluffer in a (...) movie? The rising action was decent, the climax was garbage. The male characters were hot, as they always are with LKH. But they were too touchy feely with each other. It was really distractiong from the story line. The falling action was decent, but the ending reminded me of that bad Peggy-lee song (atleast I think it was Peggy-lee) ""Thirteen men and me.""I do not recommend this book."
4,good but not the best,"though the story itself was good, the plot wasn't as captivating as before. the explations offered in this case were better and i found the fact that certain events were actually explained a fresh change from the ""boom magical powers wow"" phase of the first two.the progression of the plot is interesting, and the possibilities it hold for future books are numerous. i wouldn't say this is her best work in this series but its certaintly gotten me looking forward to the next one."
1,Ho hum.,"I rarely do not finish a book that I've started reading, especially if it's one by an author that I like. I just could not finish this one. Hamilton used to be one of my favorite authors, but not any more. Too much sex, not enough plot, and too much of what Merry doesn't know but everyone else around her does know and has to explain. Substitute ""Anita"" for ""Merry"" and you've got my feelings on her latest Anita Blake novels, too.Such a shame to see a good author degrade her work to this level."
3,Not bad for entertainment reading,I must admit very guiltly that I liked this book inspite of the fact that it was all sex and very little plot. To have as much sex as it had did detract from the actual story. What plot there was however was well done. Laural K Hamilton is a good writer she can and has done better than this. In spite of that if you are just looking for a quick entertaining read you might like it. Overalll it need less sex more plot and to be longer. I would hope that in the next book we finally see Merry actually having a showdown with Taranis at long last(it better be good).
5,Best of the Three,"Like a lot of reviewers, I was surprised that Merry's visits to the Goblin and Seelie courts didn't get covered in this book. But a LOT happened, and there's a lot of set-up for the future. Merry returns to the Unseelie court, and new or returned magic is everywhere. It's not really short - 367 pages. The sex scenes were amazing, and we learn more about some of the original 5 guards, as well as meeting new ones. The book left me wondering ""Where's book 4?!"""
1,TMI too much information!!,I was really disappointed in the 3rd book in this series. The 1st two books I expected some background information to bring the current story into play. But this book spent 3/4 of the time into background information (this happened back because of this & that blah blah blah blah). I found myself bored beyond belief. I am disappointed as this definetly doesnt meet Ms. Hamilton extreme work's of art out there.
3,"Okay, but too much description/dialogue, not enough action","This one was just okay for me. The idea behind the plot was good, but it covered only a couple of days and most of it was filled with long political descriptions and dialogue. There wasn't enough action to support all those slower passages. The book did advance the overall storyline, and further developed several of the characters (while adding more), but it wasn't enough to overcome the ""bogginess"" of it. Hopefully the next one will be better."
1,seduced by moonlight,"this book was poorly written and very hard to follow, it was boring and very hard to finish and was totally usless in the series"
3,Seduced by the Moonlight,"It was a good listen. I wasn't as anxious to listen to it as I was the previous one. Since I listen to all my audios in the car, I rate them by whether or not they maintain my interest. The best ones are those that keep me listening even if I have to stay parked in the driveway when I get home since I can't turn it off!"
3,Did I miss something?,"Being a big LKH fan, I thought that I would never say anything bad about her books, I am on that will stay up all night just to finish one of her books but with this one, I found that I got lost some where back in day one. I put this book down and had to force myself to finish it.I thought that when you set a direction in your book, like going to the seelie court... you go there. It was like watching Lord of the Rings part one... and they go over the mountain, with nothing happening. I know that I will continue reading her novels to see what happens, but I was not impressed with this one."
3,Genre hopping fantasy/horror or fantasy/romance?,"I've read all of Hamilton's published books beginning with the Anita Blake books in the mid-1990s. While this current book is a fun read, I cannot help but think her recent works are increasingly mismarketed. Over the past 4-5 years, I have noticed a rapid upswing in the amount of sex and sexual situations she places her characters in throughout the books in both series. Though I have no problems with it myself, I would be appalled if my juvenile nieces got ahold of these books and read them. I think the amount of sexual content in these books warrants them placed perhaps closer to the 'romance' section over the 'horror/fantasy' areas I find them in bookstores. While this book is fun and interesting, I think its important to note that many of the unaware may not be prepared to explain the difference between fantasy multiple partners and the reality and dangers of the real thing to minors who may pick this up as escapist fun mind candy."
3,"Merry Genty, back at it again........","The third book in the Merry Gentry series is the best yet, and promises more good things to come with future adventures. Although they pale in comparison with the Anita Blake series, they're still a good series, dripping with the usual court and politiacl intrugues, magic, and of course, sexual intrigues. Its a good book, the only dissapointing aspect being that it really isn't long enough."
2,Where's the Plot?,"I have to say I was somewhat disapointed with this one. I *LOVE* the other Laurell K. Hamilton books. Usually they leave me eager for the next book, and wanting more. This book was the exception.Oh, there's lots of the usual graphic details and yummy bits, but the actual *PLOT* doesn't hold it together. There just wasn't much substance there.I'm hoping that she used this book to set up the next one, but somehow I'm doubtful. I hope the next one's better."
3,Is there more to it?,"I'm not going into the plot lines of the book, since it's already been done and much better than I could accomplish on here. I was disapointed in the writing and editing. It took almost half of the book to get through one single night between the rehashing & reintroductions of everyone in Merry's bedroom.Then we get to Faerie and while that was very interesting, the book ends because all the characters wore themselves out. I don't think one single thread of plot had been resolved at all.So what was the ultimate point of the book??? It's not very large, so it seems that it originally was a much longer story and someone decided to cut it in half. Or perhaps that's all LKH felt like writing until the next volume. I love the concept of Merry's world. Unfortunately, the books get smaller with each publication even though they take longer to appear in print. What a pity."
2,Actiontec Call Waiting Modem,"I've had this modem for about four months and am very disappointed with the support updates. The software supplied for fax and message is very old and not easy to install. When it does install, the modem's voice capabilities are not recognized. The V92 drivers are difficult to install if you're not an experienced user. I've been checking the company's website since I purchased this modem and they have still not updated the drivers to easily install V92 capabilities. Email to support has never been responded to. I would not purchase another of their products."
1,Could be a good modem if Actiontec would support it.,"Sep. 2003 Actiontec shipped V90 driver.inf files for all OSs except WinXp. XP driver worked with WinME for me. Modem on hold is NOT V92 compliant and disconnects on all incoming calls. CallWaiting utility reports settings successful but testing in hyperterminal reports ERROR This is a problem with the firmware. Tech support shipped me NEW driver disk, same as old. Kept me on the phone forever, Toll call."
2,Do not be fooled...,"There's only one Woody cartoon in this tape, titled 'Pantry Panic'. The other 3 Non-Woody toons are: Song of the Birds, Hap Hap Happy Day, and Bars and Stripes Forever. These cartoons are all Public Domain toons with so-so picture quality. If it weren't for the Woody toon, I would have stayed away from this one..."
1,don't get jipped!!,"i found this video at a local supermarket and it has only onecartoon of woody. the rest well, is of old cartoons i have never seen or heard of..i am in my early 30's--"
5,Nice Rapier,"I really liked this sword. It really is beautyful. Seems to be pretty sturdy also, it fits well in the sheath. It is hard to see the real detail in the picture, the handle is very nice and the guard with the spirals alond with the cris blade make this a very nice sword. The blade and metal parts of the scabbard came oiled so they arrived without blemish. Will look great at the next Renaissance Faire I attend. The center of balance is about 3 inches above the guard witch is about maximum for handling, but I think it handles well for a sword of this price. Also I received it in about a week, so I was quite happy with the overall transaction."
2,Loose and wobbly.,"As a nurse myself, I wanted something for my mother to use so she could carry her dishes. After trying both this one and theDuro-Med Fold Away, I've come to realize that there simply is not a perfect solution.This one is easier to use than the other one, but it is so wobbly no dish will stay on it. I finally tied a scarf around the sides and handles of the walker, which helped, but she now isn't able to hold the walker handles very well.If you live in a larger city, your best bet would be to shop around in your local stores and, just as a woman would dresses, try them on first. I am not so lucky. I live in a moderately sized city, but medical equipment competition is very lacking.I'm going to keep this one because I've already tried two, but it's not the saving grace that some have called it."
2,tray for walker,This tray looks sturdy enough but it will not fit over a walker with rubber grips.I have no choice but to send it back. I wish Amazon had noted this before I ordered it.
2,Not the right size.,Had to return it - it was not a good fit for the model walker we have. Would ave been perfect if it had.
2,Universal fit = compromise = no ones totally happy,"Okay, so I wasn't expecting much really. But I'm stuck using a walker for two months and figured a tray would help me during the day when I am alone. It made sense in theory - make some lunch, put it on the tray, hobble back to bed. But like so many ""universal fit"" products, that means it doesn't actually fit anything perfectly. On my walker it doesn't rest comfortably the cross bars, so at any given moment, it may angle forward or may angle back, allowing things to slide off the tray. And while I am pretty careful, using a walker is inherently a jerky business. Not really a great product...just a compromise where no one is ever really happy."
2,wrong sixe,The first time i have needed to use a walker and didnt know there was more than one size.Had to return them.
2,difficult to measure size,"I ordered the tray walker for use after a hip replacement required extended time using the walker. I thought I had measured correctly for my walker. When it arrived, I found the tray fit over the bars accurately, but it would not lie flat. Thus, the tray slanted anytime it was even lightly bumped. Therefore, it was relatively useless for anything other than light weight, non-spillable objects. Also, keep in mind that the tray will block your access to placing one's body in between the bars of the walker;consequently, if the walker is needed for anything other than balance (taking one's weight off an injured leg), the tray will also prove unusable. The tray itself is fine and should last a long time. It may just be one of those things that is best purchased in house uniquely for each particular walker and not something easily selected on line."
5,Tried Many and This Is The Best,"Without a doubt, these are the sturdiest and easiest to install child safety latches available. If they're not in stock on Amazon, you can get them elsewhere. Everything else is a compromise."
4,Fascinating,"A collection of essays by crime/mystery writers on writing, mysteries (writing and field), and their own experience. I found these to be genuinely motivating, very interesting and revealing. I've never thought to write a crime novel--I've always been an SF/F reader, and that's what I feel I write when I write--but I enjoy mysteries, and have done so ever since I began reading. The first two adult books I remember reading, besides the Bible, was the complete O'Henry and Sherlock Holmes. It was interesting to find writers here with similar experiences to mine--in particular, K.C. Constantine and his school problems. Of the writers in this volume (Robert Barnard, Rex Burns, Constantine, Dorothy Salisbury Davis, Michael Gilbert, Donald Hamilton, Joseph Hansen, Tony Hillerman, Reginald Hill, James McClure, and Robert B. Parker), I've only read Parker. From these essays, I am interested in reading something else by all of them with the exception of Davis and Hill."
2,Make sure you are getting the entire book!,"The 1977 Wings music book of Townes Van Zandt songs contained a ""Post Card"" inside. This postcard had the words to Pancho and Lefty on it. Without the Post Card this book is not complete and therefore not worth the asking price. Unless you don't care about getting the entire book. From time to time you will find them with the post card. Be patient."
4,Not really for numbers learning but still kept kids busy.,"This book kept my 3 year old busy on the plane and she was able to get the stickers off with ease. But it is basically just a shape search and match book. Most of the time is spent flipping between the sticker pages and the pages you stick the matching sticker on. All-in-all, it probably took her about 2 hours to go through. We were also able to teach her a little bit of math by asking her ""How many more... do you need?"""
1,Used product,This sticker/activity book came used and half completed. Are you serious???? The point of purchasing the product was for my daughter to do the activity. Why would I want an activity book another child has worked in.
1,Give me a break!,This must be the most expensive book on Amazon. Why???No content can justify this price.
5,MARK CHESNUTT ~ Mark Chesnutt,"I absolutely LOVED this CD. I'm a big Mark Chesnutt fan and have never gotten a CD of his that I didn't like. However, if I could only have one Mark Chesnutt CD (perish the thought) it would be ""Mark Chesnutt"". Toe tappin' get your feet movin' tunes combined with romantic ballads and laugh out loud humour all done in that trademark voice. Oh man!<g>"
5,Great resource,"The DVD is an excellent overview of the MDG and provides enought material to generate classroom discussion. Perhaps the best contribution is that the material stimulates ""what do we do now"" type of comments and succeeds in engaging the audience. I used this with my college freshmen class and was very well pleased with it."
5,The Bach biography,"This is unquestionably the single volume Bach biography for non-specialists, although musicologists will find it invaluable as well. Wolff has done a lot of debunking of various Bach myths (i.e., ""Bach died while writing the final fugue in Art of Fugue, and dictated the chorale in his last breath""), but stilll has never lost his sense of wonder about this giant. Wolff also does a better job than most of placing Bach in European intellectual history as a whole, not just musical history. His comparison of Bach to Newton, while not original, is apt and insightful. The best thing about this book, however, is that it led me back to the music with several new insights. For example, Wolff's analysis of the famous d minor tocatta (BWV 565) led me to realize just how advanced this very early work is. Highly reccomended."
3,The last great Bach hagiography,"Wolff stands last in a long line of writers (Spitta, Schweitzer) whose heads are bent so far forward in genuflection that they can't see Bach's foibles. As a result, Bach becomes a bland, benevolent character for Wolff. The insult leading to his duel -- surely an event that shows Bach to be rather feisty -- is translated as 'greenhorn bassoonist' rather than the dialectically correct (and certainly more likely to be grounds for a swordfight) 'prick of a bassoonist', for example. It's a decent book, and thorough, but Wolff's comparison of Bach to Newton is strained and grows tiresome. Future biographies of Bach will undoubtedly do their best to drag their subject back to earth, and will be all the better for it."
1,THIS MOVIE IS CUT!,"This is the movie of your childhood memories BUT! it has been edited to death! Everywere where there might be any indication of a niple (a little pink dot) the editors has cut the pice out of the movie. This is the old anime movie but if you are interested in the real one, the uncut version, pleas don't hesitat to contact me. I know were to find the original one. woombah@hotmail.com"
2,hard to follow,"the movie was hard to follow. If you left the room, you would have to restart or back it up to see what the story line was."
3,4.3.2.1,I bought this movie because of Freddie Stroma being in the movie. The movie was okay but not the best movie out. And didn't care for who Freddie played.
3,It's Pulp Fiction meets Mean Girls,"Here's The Lowedown on ""4.3.2.1"" (A Thriller DVD review)...LIKED ITGenre: 6.5 Movie: 6Become a fan of The Lowedown on Facebook: [...]What's it about?This exciting crime thriller tracks 4 best friends over 3 days they will never forget. Their lives change forever when a chance encounter with some deadly thieves sends their worlds on a collision course with the players in a major diamond heist.What did I think?It was ""Pulp Fiction"" meets ""Mean Girls"" in this edgy British thriller. You go on a 3 day journey with 4 girls, but you follow one girl at a time. I liked that it would tell one girl's story, then rewind and tell another's. All 4 stories tie together in pieces during the movie, then as a whole at the end. It made for a nice movie where you got the whole story and not just one point of view. I enjoyed it and I hope you will too."
1,Really Bad!,This has to be the worst movie ever for me. I wont even consider parts 2 and 3. I regret wasting my money but ill sell it at my summer garage sale.
2,don't be loco and but this book,"South Beach?? North Beach? Puleeeze!!!!! What's next, the Flushing Diet? The Bronx Diet? The China Town Diet? These books only make people fat. Diet boloney!I guarantee you; the same fatties that will be on this diet will be on a different diet next year. A new fad diet.Diet's don't work. Exercise friends!"
5,Para adelagazar disfrutando de la dieta,"Por fin encontre una dieta que es un placer seguir las recomendaciones dia a dia, porque uno adelgaza descubriendo sabores y sin sufrimientos."
5,Excellent Diet and Lifestyle change,"Clearly the guy that wrote about exercising being the only method of losing weight as never tried this book. Its not a diet, but a complete life style change. I have only been on it for a week so I am still in the strict phase, but I have already lost 6 pounds. I feel better about myself and I have more energy. If you are serious about getting healthy, I highly recommend this book. You will not be disappointed."
4,the book to read,The techniques in this book were business saving. I have read several books on networking but I found them all repetative and unexciting. Lillain D. Bjorseth finds a new and novel approach to marketing that is smart and efective. The other book that I depend on for my business was Guerrilla PR Wired by Michael Levine. That book showed me everything I needed to successfully promote my business and with Breakthrough Networking I find I have confidence and business savy.
5,Good Networking Advice - Well Presented,"The best thing I can say about this book is that after reading through it quickly initially, I have over the past few weeks dipped into it on a regular basis while preparing for my next network or business meeting. It is a very useful tool for anyone serious about networking (and who is not in this environment?)Bjorseth provides good solid commonsense ideas on how to be an effective networker.Her comments on VBC (that's Verbal Business Card) to you and me have helped me craft a much tighter, more impactful verbal pitch. The author makes it very clear that networking is not something to be taken lightly. Good networking results come from being prepared in what you say, how you say it and how you plan to say it.Way better than most networking books I've read."
4,Concise and Informative,This is definitely a great book of your starting out or just refreshing your skills in web (des/dev).
3,On the Road to Happiness...Tales of the Traveler,"Lauren C. Hudson is indeed 'On the Road to Happiness', as the title of her new motivational book suggests. Poviding an inspirational text in her first release, On the Road to Happiness...Tales of the Traveler (Pathway Publishing), Hudson writes with a light and poetic voice, but the message is far from feathery. Hudson shows her reader that life is full of ups and downs, but the journey is what makes the human experience, and no one knows this more than Hudson. After all, this book was completed after Hudson was diagnosed with breast cancer. And now, with her last radiation treatment over, and looking toward the road to recovery, Hudson and her book are the epitomes of what it means to survive life's passage. The joy of this poetic journey is that the reader doesn't travel with the feeling that she's resigned to the way life is. Hudson is more practical as she comtemplates the journey life has waiting."

3,"ok, but that's all","I bought this because my truck didn't come with an owners manual. This book does NOT take it's place. It's fine if you want to replace the heater core, but not a fuse."
4,Wish It went into more detail,This book is VERY much a like the haynes book. I wish It had a little bit more detail on certain items. It may be a little to broad however it serves its purpose.
4,A Tell Tale Hit!,"I thought this movie was impressive. Descriptive and attentive to the minor details, it was worth while to see. I gave it 4 stars just on it's charcater alone. It captured me. My heart stopped!"
2,Mediocre Movie,"The Tell-Tale Heart was a short black-and-white film. While I didn't really enjoy this movie personally, it stuck very true to the book. The dialogue was taken directly from the book.The actors portrayed the characters well. However, a stabbing was added in to the movie for effect, which was not included in the book. The tinkly music added to the very quiet and haunting atmosphere.I don't recommend this movie to those of you who enjoyed the book, but have not yet seen the movie. Though it sticks close to the book, it is quite boring and nothing out of the average."
5,A most-helpful book to me and my family.,This book explains postpartum depression very clearly and helps the family understand what the new mother is going through. The description about treatment helped explain what to expect.
3,Good for the right audience,"Not helpful if you already have had depression/anxiety or are receiving adequate treatment. Good intro to concepts of postpartum mood disorders, but nothing ground-breaking."
4,Another Great Book from Bonhoeffer,"I read Life Together several years ago, and it was the first Bonhoeffer book I read. A few months ago I completed Bonhoeffer's classic, The Cost of Discipleship. In Life Together we have Bonhoeffer's experience of Christian community. Bonhoeffer gives practical advice on how life together in the King of Kings can be sustained in families and groups. This book helped me reevaluate my spiritual practices and was a refresher that I needed."
5,These works will change your life,"Besides the Word of God (the bible), there are three other books every Christian should read, if he/she is serious about their faith.Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan; The Cost of Discipleship by D. Bonhoeffer, and this book, Life Together, by the same author. This book changed my perspective...totally, on how to live with 'my neighbour.' Think you really do love your neighbour? What about your brother and sister in the Lord? With so many church splits, arguments over trivial doctrinal issues, petty squabbles, and gossip justified as 'good ol' christian concern', this book is needed. It shows how we are REALLY to treat one another. Patterned after Christ, and based in scripture--this book is a must."
4,"Very, very good","This is powerful exploration of the nature of biblical community. Written by Bonhoeffer who led an underground seminary in Nazi Germany, this book has the undertones of monastery - but it is still a penetrating analysis on the nature of true community. One thing I especially appreciated was the realism of this book. Bonhoeffer helps us get over the greener-pasture syndrome and actually embrace the believers that God has placed in our lives. As with Bonhoeffer's Cost of Discipleship, this is a modern classic worth the thoughtful reading and reflection of any growing Christian."
5,wonderful counsel,"I enjoyed this book immensely. There is a great deal of practical wisdom in this book that speaks to the daily struggles people of faith may encounter with other believers. When we understand that we have all entered into the community of Christian faith through the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, regardless of the diversity of our backgrounds or educational levels or any number of things that may separate us and cause division, we know that his command to ""love one another"" is a command to be taken seriously. Bonhoeffer's love for Christ, and his love for the body of Christ shines warmly in this wonderful book. I highly recommend this book to anyone desiring to gain deeper insights into what it means to ""love one another deeply, from the heart..."" (1 Peter 1:22)"
2,"Coach 54, Golf Fundamentals for the Future","SAVE YOUR MONEYPia Nilsson and Lynn Marriott's Golf54 Process is proven and I will try to incorporate all their advice but this video is not as good as their book. The way the video is shot is distracting and unprofessional looking. Interviews are in an awful room with the most distracting horizontal wallpaper. They use average golfers in the drills, lumps and all (I have lumps too but I do not want to see them in a golf video). Their book ""Every Shot Must Have A Purpose"" is more complete, save your money and buy the book."
2,Bad collection with only 2 good short films,"I've loved computer animation since I was a little kid, and own several collections of short films. This one is very lackluster, with only 2 titles, ""Crocotires"" and ""Horses on Mars,"" being the slightest bit enjoyable (they're actually quite good! The rest is rubbish, and I cannot recommend spending any amount of this collection."
4,yes some songs are edited,as some of you know already most of the songs are edited if you read the liner notes black steel is the single edit version as for fight the power the uncensered version is in do the right thing soundtrack the song is surpriselenly edited in fear of a black planet but all in all it's a nicely put togetther for people that are not fimiler with pe good remastering too way bettter than the millenum collection
2,Strangely disappointing sound production quality,"Let me begin by saying I am a huge Public Enemy fan who was expecting to absolutely love this CD. Yet, I found one flaw was very disappointing: The CD sound has a strange tinny quality in several of the songs. Something is just off. The music doesn't sound as compelling with this small, but noticable change.I have absolutely no rational explanation for why someone would change the sound mix from what worked in the original recordings. I don't know if it was done intentionally or on accident, but clearly, something has been changed just slightly in several of the recordings. ""Fight the Power"" is the most notable example.I feel sad, like someone drew a moustache on the Mona Lisa or chipped off the nose of George Washington's face on Mount Rushmore. Why would someone mess with perfection?"
3,Pretty Good&kinda Overrated,"I dug Public Enemy alot more back in the day,but in hindsight it's kinda hard to take them serious when I put together the 2 Stoogies or Laurel&Hardy Routine that Chuck D.&Flavor Flav pulled off. on one Hand there was a Serious Message at work,but on the other Hand Flavor Flav seemed like a Early Audtion to the ""Being Bobby Brown"" Show. when they made Music you could get away with more Smaples&Loops. they were never the same once they went New Jack.Chuck D is a very Talented MC,but they couldn't grow no more after 1991.they had a strong 4 year run from 87-91,but in Hindsight this Collection might be all you will ever need from them.in all honesty:I can take or leave them."
3,"ok, wanted a little more variety","not bad, but i thought it'd have some of the other well-known hits on it as well. good for reminiscing about my youth!"
4,"Entertaining and illuminating, enjoyable, but not Faulkner","Heddle obviously draws from his knowledge of the physics academic community (and physics itself) to write this. This is to the good; one should write about things one knows about, and this allows one to convey the ring of truth (and allows the reader to actually learn something).His point of view is also clear, but not thrust annoyingly upon the reader (at least to my ear). (Unlike other authors who write in science-related fields whom I could point out.)There is good use of humor (I laughed out loud in places as well), insight into human behavior, etc.; so it's definitely worth a read.But in honesty, I wouldn't quite consider it highbrow/fine literature. (Perhaps one more go-around with an editor might have made a big difference.)"
1,The History of the Book in Canada now has one awful addition,"This book is the worse; a shoddy, simple, listing of the books published in Canada. There is no insight that is not insipid. There are lame attempts to connect the history of publishing to the growth of reading, but beyond that obvious theory, there is a whole lot on nothing. Academically this book is bankrupt. There is no scholarship, no passion, nothing. And the monies given in grant to complete this project should be considered given in bad faith. What a waste. Hollow, pompous and dull! The history of the book in Canada now has one awful addition. Avoid at all costs!!!"
3,Good Enough For Halloween Fans,"Many sequels do not live up to their original. In this case, Halloween 2 (The Nightmare Isn't Over), is quite respectable. Though it's not quite as shocking as Halloween (1978) was, it still delivers what fans want. You have to like the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis returns, and Donald Pleasance, but the movie mostly takes place in a dark hospital, and most of the suspense has been lost. This film will be dumb for non-Halloween fans, but for Halloween fans, it's watchable."
3,Bargain !!!,"This is a real bargain-buy! Halloween II is a rather rare movie,and for less than ten bucks you get a quite good dvd version of it. Letterboxed and with good sound and picture quality. Many people here complain about the lack of extras, but does all movies have to come in a 2-disc limited edition set? Others compare it to the original, and of course this movie is not that sort of all-time classic. Anyway, I think Halloween II is one of the best horror-sequels ever. It holds more than enough scares to keep you on the edge of your seat for 90 minutes. Buy it !"
5,FIVE STARS ONLY FOR TERROR IN THE AISLES!!!,Halloween 2 isn't a bad movie but the real treat is that we are FINALLY getting Terror in the Aisles on a digital format. I figured that the rights issues would have prevented this from ever being re-released but I'm soo happy that we're going to get it on Blu-ray. I just hope that nothing has been cut.
4,HALLOWEEN IS BACK,"Amazing, I love this film. It feels like the first one, but different surrounding. Halloween 2 is a classic and is one of my favorite horror films.The shape is searching a hospital looking for his sister. If you are new to the series, I won't spoil it. Check it out if you like the first one, then again who doesnt like the first one.The only problem I had with this film, is it felt like Friday the 13th at some parts of the film. There is a scene with a cop being scared by a cat. Reminds me of the beginning of Friday the 13th part 2, with the cat scare. Other than the little things, it is a classic. If you love Halloween check it out. After this film, the series takes a huge nose dive, but is brought back to life with H20."
3,Dumb but still pretty creepy continuation of the first film,"Critics bashed this film when it came out in theatres. Yes, it's vastly inferior to the first, but Michael Myers (played well here by stuntman Dick Warlock) is still a creepy presence. Forget that the hospital is poorly lit and ridiculously understaffed; forget that the killer breaks windows by simply walking into them; forget that his scalpel can support a nurse in mid-air, without her sliding off it; etc. The music is altered slightly at times, but is still creepy. And the ending certainly looked liked the door to any other sequels was slammed shut; unfortunately in this day and age we know better. Good fun."
2,ALMOST as good,"This takes place immediately after H1 with Michael stalking his sister in the hospital. Again, Donald Pleasence is great in this movie, but the series starts its downfall after this movie"
2,Ruins the original.,"The only reason that I gave this two stars is because it is cool how it starts on the same night.In this film - he kills people who aren't even in his way of getting to Curtis. WHAT!?!Explicitly bloody. I get queezy when I watch this. Scalpels give me the heebie jeebies.Lame, gory, and contradictory (see a review below)."
3,should have spent more time restoring this classic,going to be short first of all i have the original 2003 standard release of this halloween and it is a better quality transfer without the white specks and grain throughout. but this maybe the best possible negative in the vault from what i have heard is the previous copies were lost and the colors are remarkable and bright. being this is a 30th anniversary edition the original 1978 carpenter classic i have and it is beautiful. so i give this 3 out of five for transfer the rest is a five star classic.
2,Who asked for a sequel?,"Halloween II starts right where the original ends.This time Michael Myers is killing people in a Hospital.Pretty, boring and stupid."
4,"Not quite good as the first, but excellent for a sequel","Scary and creepy, this is probably one of the best horror sequels of all time. It does not surpass the original, but it comes very very close to doing so. My only caveat is that this print is not THX certified as the first movie is."
2,Not nearly as suspenseful as the original.,"I have always believed that the Halloween series should have been left at the first one, and perhaps H20 as a commemorative. This is Jamie Lee Curtis' last role before H20 (17 years after this movie). This movie relies more on really nasty murders (not just with Michaels knife) as opposed to suspense, and spine tingling terror of the first movie. I believe horror movies that go on suspense far outweight those that have to show graphically intense needles in eyes, people boiling to death, etc. These things can be done, but Halloween 1 did it with class. There is not the same class here. I believe it was going against the Jason movies at this time and of course we know those are absolutely nothing but plotless gore flicks. I give it two stars SOLELY for the fact they continue the plot by introducing the fact Laurie Strobe is in fact, Michaels sister."
1,STOP! This is a total scam. You are NOT getting a blu-ray in this box,So I was really happy to see this set come out with both the film and TV version all in one set. I already own the Universal Halloween 2 release on blu-ray that came out a few months back.I was SHOCKED when I opened this blu-ray and found 2 discs. The Movie version is on blu-ray. HOWEVER.... The TV version is on DVD. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So I am really only buying this version to get the TV version on blu-ray and I get a DVD.DO NOT BUY THIS if you are expected to get both versions on Blu-ray.For the price tag I have to say I have been totally ripped off and scammed by Shout Factory. NO WHERE does it say on the box is the TV version on DVD at all. If you buy a Blu-ray you expect to get the film on BLU-RAY!
3,Decent,"This is one if you do the Randy Micky conversation would fall; under suck. Because thia can't even try to come to the level of the first, but is still decent for what it is. This also has the unwritten rules of seguels. 1. Body cont is larger 2. More blood more Gore. 3. Never assume the killer is dead. This is actually a have to see if youv'e seen the first and you want to se H20. So watch it if you want to."
5,I love horror movies,i love horroe movies but halloween and candyman and all the other halloween movies r grate. I wish joseph mazzello would of been in halloween
1,What a disappointment.,"Halloween II starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence picks up right where the original left off. This seuqel is a complete letdown, the actors look bored and robotic and the twist ending just about killed it for me. Stick to the original and leave this one to rot!"
2,Sequel became what the imitators are,"Halloween II left off exactly where the first one ended, and that is pretty much it. While the first one is a stunningly well crafted SCAREFEST, the sequel degenerated into a typical gorefest. Instead of carrying on the tradition set by the first one, Halloween II only succeeded in doing what countless Halloween clones have done: In lieu of skillful filmmaking to create a sense of terror, it instead relied on grossing out the audience. We have Michael Myers stalking the halls of a hopsital in which it seems that Laurie Strode is the ONLY patient.Fine. Some people like gore. But I'd much rather like a well crafted movie. And like Friday the 13th and the Nightmare on Elm Street films, Halloween started out as a good movie which eventually turned into an endless series of inferior rehashes which ultimately parodies itself. As far as I am concern, Halloween II should have been the last of the series. Okay, maybe Halloween H20 should be the last."
5,ONE OF THE BEST SEQUELS EVER!,All to say is that this one rules. It doesn't get better especially Dr. Loomis' dialogue. Oh yeah who can forget about the best character which is Ben Tramer. The need to bring him back to life.--Joe
2,The first Halloween was much better!!!,"In my opinion this is a very stupid and unrealistic sequal I mean I know for a fact that there is more then about 10 people working graveyard shift at the hospitals!!!There are always the same amount of people!!!And in this movie there is hardly any hospital staff and it relies to much on killing...I was highly disapointed with this movie it did not at all meet up to my expectations and they were not very high either...The acting was good and that's the only thing that kept me from rating this movie any lower...Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job as usual.!And that guy who wants her is quite charming,in this sequal you find out Michael the reason Michael Meyers wants to kill her is because he is her brother..."
3,Halloween II is ok,"Ok, lets face it, this is one of those gory sequels. And it comes no were to the original. Jamie Lee is drugged up and sleeping in most of this movie. And the police finally listen to Loomis about Myers being alive and still out there. This movie is cool, and i suggest you rent it or buy it if you like it. Its to bad Universal didnt keep their rights to Halloween II, Instead they sold the rights to Goodtimes! There is not much on the disc, just some production notes."
2,A not so good sequel of a classic movie.,"Halloween 2 has to be the worst way that they could have continued the story. Jamie Lee has hardly any lines, and the new characters just don't match up to the ones in the original. This movie had the potential to be fantastic, but they blew it with the setting. I don't know where, but they could have easily set it somewhere else. Also, this movie is gore galore, {The Hot tub scene!} It just does not do the job."
5,Michael is back!!!,Halloween II has Many cool features and very exciting to watch especially during Halloween season. Shipped fast and love it
5,THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE HALLOWEEN,"I always loved this movie. But now, with both the theatrical & TV versions, it has become my favorite over the original. The TV version has all the extra scenes that are cut from the theatrical version, and it makes the movie more coherant. Plus two different commentaries is a nice extra. One from the director, and another from Dick Warlock who played Michael Myers. Both commentaries are great & satisfying. Finally, the extras i have been waiting for including a making of Halloween II, and the deleted scenes that end up in the TV version. Nice clean picture and sound make this a must have!"
5,Second Most Awesome Slasher Movie of all time,"This is the sequel to 1978's ""Halloween"", and though the movie was made three years after Halloween, it's made to be a continuation of that same Halloween night in 1978. ""Halloween II"" is my second favorite slasher movie of all time. Michael Myers just won't seem to die."
3,Purchased DVD for a gift,"DVD was not secure in the case,This was purchased as a gift and haven't heard of any complaintsand yes I would recommend this to anyone and everyone :)"
4,Good for a sequel,"Many horror movie sequels arent even worth watching,but this one is an exception. It takes off right from where the first one left us and immediatly kicks into the murder and mayhem that Micheal Myers is good for. They take Laure to the hospital for her wounds and Micheal follows them to the hospital with Dr Loomis hot on the trail. This film has all the suspense that the first one had ,but it just didnt have that scary atmosphere to it,the first one was a very dark film,the second one is shot in a hospital which is scary in itself, but not like the dark streets of Haddonfield. This movie had a little more violence it it than the first one and a little more profanity. Rated R for mild violence, strong language,A scene of sexuality,and partial nudity"
3,GOOD BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST,THIS ONE WAS JUST OKAY.I GAVE IT THREE STARS BECAUSE IT WAS PRETTY SCARY.JUST SEE THIS MOVIE ANYWAY.IT TAKES OFF WHERE THE FIRST HALLOWEEN ENDED
3,A terrifying night of butchery!,"Uneven sequel to the original, Halloween 2 is mainly set in a hospital. This is the one where we find out that supernatural menace, Michael Myers is the brother of Laurie Strode(Jamie Leigh Curtis)But the ending leaves a lot to be desired as both Donald Pleasence and Myers are supposedly blown up in an explosion in the hospital, thus leaving us thinking both of them are dead.But it will take a few more Halloween nights before Michael gets his comeuppance."
5,Worth every penny and more,"This Blu Ray is well worth the price and then some.Besides the film itself being an 80's classic and worthy sequel to Halloween.It has the documentary ""Terror In The Aisles"" which you can only get on VHS in it's entirety also in Blu Ray,that was huge for me.The transfer of the Film itself is really good as well as the sound being awesome.I say it's a gift from the Horror Gods."
2,Bog Average Slasher,"This flick doesn't hold up as well as it did thirty years ago. Back when I was an impressionable undiscrimanating seventeen year old the body count was good enough for me. It was also pretty cool watching it with an urban audience who shouted at the screen imploring in vain for the victims not to open door or closet. Now it's no better or worse than any knockoff of the classic original ""Halloween"". Events take place on the same evening as the original but it's more preposterous. They open things up by having the action set mainly at a hospital but that makes it more ludicrous. This has to be the darkest most sparcely staffed hospital I've ever seen. Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis reprise their roles from the original but that only adds so much cred. Proceed if you must but be prepared to be disappointed"
2,Certanly could have been better,"I'll make this quick. I like the beginning. It starts off promising, but then it just goes down hill. The moment Laurie enters the hospital things turn in to a bore fest. It was scary. I did like the movie just like every other Halloween movie. It was kind of interesting when Sam Loomis is still looking for Michael on the streets. But the parts near the ending!! It ruins the movie. I could name several other problems with the movie, but I think I'll go back to watching the original Halloween and the other sequals. Do you have to say anything about what I said about this movie? If you do E-mail me at: omicron_30@yahoo.com"
2,A SO-SO SEQUEL TO A GREAT THRILLER.,"Okay I saw HALLOWEEN 2 and I wish I could report that it is as good as the original but it's not and here's why I think it isn't. First of all youn see micheal myers way too often which takes away the suspense too soon in the movie. Plus I felt that the supporting cast's acting left something too be desired as well it was horrrible. I felt that the only thing that saved this movie was DONALD PLESANCE and JAMIE LEE CURTIS'S performances in thier reprised roles from the first movie if they hadn't been in it this movie, it would have been disastorus so all in all I can't really recommend HALLOWEEN 2."
4,Not your Typical Sequel...As Great as The First!!!,"Of Course, the first Halloween is the best, but this sequel is a great follow up to one of the best horror films made! It leaves off where the first stopped and didn't fall at any part of the film. It keeps you wanting more and leaves you fully satisfied unlike most sequels which fail to impress. If you loved the first, see Halloween II you will not be disappointed!"
5,Loved it,"Loved this Bluray release. It was everything I read about and that I wanted.Great picture and sound. With the surround sound i have. I am surprised people didn,t call the cops think there were gun shots from my house. LOL. This is also where The Myers and Loomis story should had ended!"
4,A great sequal!,This has suprising twits and turns but Lori finds the bodies the way she always does!!
3,It's okay .. but not nearly as good as the first one ..,"I loved the first movie because it was all suspense and scare with no blood or special effects, but the second one was basically just gory .. i didn't get scared at all! Also, in the first movie, we all liked and understood all the characters, making it much more powerful when they died. The second Halloween made no effort whatsoever to make us like and empathize with the characters, making us care very little whether they live or die. The second movie, however, is pivotal to the series, considering the fact that we learn of Micheal's and Laurie's relationship. And, I don't think that Jimmy and Laurie got enough time together in Halloween II .. it would have been nice to have a little romance between them .. I hope that this review was helpful to you!"
5,perfect second,ilove halloween very scary but this this comes really close to being better than the first one like this shows the killer alot like on regular horror movies hes in your house and leaves girl screms than a helicopter or persons talking.well this never stops showing michal theres only one sce4ne where hes not there.
3,"Good, but not as good as the original",This movie was a great sequel but not as good as the original. This movie was great and is a must see.
3,"Okay Sequel, Strange Company","Okay, after you read this go to the box cover image and click on it to enlarge it. You will see that they mispelled Jamie Lee Curtis! They spelled it JAIME!!! Goodtimes Video is the distributor, and boy are they good at typos. I wish they would release a restored version of this movie -- digitally mastered like they did to the first movie several times. It's not as good as the original, but what sequel is? It has it's moments. Check out Jamie Lee's bad wig, and how she has maybe 5 lines in the whole movie! The hospital is creepy though, and the music alone will send chills down your spine."
4,"Good, but the first one is better","There was a Halloween marathon playing on T.V and they played the 1st one, after it was over they said the 2nd was playing Im like im gonna watch it.After the film was over I was pleased, but I noticed something, Michael Myers mask was different, it was kinda of messy.I liked the movie, kinda of cheesy parts to it, 1st one was better, but this one was still good."
3,"""Oh yes, there is a boogeyman"".","And he seem to be even more relentless in this film. Rating this video is a little hard, yet easy. Hard in the fact that I like it and shouldn't, and easy because it so easy to slam. In the easy to slam catergory, it doesn't in any way stand up to the original. Rick Rosenthal's direction is not on par with Carpenter's. The Michael Myers figure just seems like a killing machine without any motivation. I could go on with so many other reasons on why this movie shouldn't have worked for me, but I only have so much space. I guess the only reason that it does work for me on any level is because of the presense of Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence. They make what have been unwatchable in the hands of other actors bearable."
4,good sequal,the action for this story line starta little quicker but then you dont realy need a review for this movie because everyone seen it
5,"Phenominal sequel, and a cut above the rest!!!","I think Halloween II is great!! Granted, it doesn't have the scares the original did, but I do like that Rick Rosenthal stepped up the gore a little bit. In the first one Michael Myerskilled everybody by simply stabbing them. Whereas in this one he's alot more inventive. Like when he drowns the nurse and burnsher skin off her face. That is really cool. Or when he puts thesyringe,or needle in Dr. Mixters, and the nurses eye. That's some neat stuff.Personally I think they should have stopped after this sequel, but the others are ok too. Except 3. That had nothing to do with the Michael Myers storylines, and was generally corny.But Halloween II is brilliant,and a very worthy sequel."
2,Halloween 2 is Gory,"Gore, gore, gore galore! There is a lot of gore in this film! The death scenes include getting your wrist slit and it bleeds into a big puddle. Then you get a syringe into your temple! Your face gets melted in hot water! And so the list goes on! Laurie Strode is taken to the Hospital. Michael follows to the building and kills everyone except Laurie! And again she is chased..... Halloween, the original, was known for being creepy, without using a lot of blood. This is why I gave this film 2 stars. I have this movie though. I need it for my collection! The ending of this film makes you feel like Michael is dead forever... Alas, Michael seems like he will never be put six feet under. Rated R for strong violence, nudity, some strong language, and gory deaths"
4,Excellent follow up,"I thought this was a very entertaining sequel to its predecessor, Halloween. The plot is what impressed me the most. The story continued straight on from where it left off, unlike other slasher movies where the killer dies and comes back again no matter what. Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis) is in hospital getting treated for her injuries and trying to recover from her ordeal when who should appear but- Michael Myers! Donald Pleasance is also very convincing as Myer's doctor Dr. Sam Loomis. Of course it wasn't as good as its predecessor but still great fun."
3,Alright sequal,Extremely violent. Death tools: 1. Hammer 2. Needle through eyeball/brain 3. Scalple 4. Kitchen knife 5. Boiling water Its all here! Not bad film.
4,at least they used the same mask...,"Halloween 2 is creepy. Not as scary as the first film, but still very good. And the soundtrack is excellent."
3,Good but it's need to add more meat in it...,"Geez I would be honest with you that it is not as good as the original one ""Halloween"" to say at least it is good, it's better than nothing. If you are looking for one good scare then you should see ""Halloween"" and ""H20""."
3,Deleted scenes not added to the movie!,"Obviously I'm not going to completely hate this, because it is afterall Halloween 2-one of the greatest horror sequels ever. My peeve is the deleted scenes not being added into the movie. My Bloody Valentine did it, why can't Universal do it? LAZINESS! If you are going to release a 30 year anniversary edition, it should SCREAM awesomeness. And Terror in the Aisles? This has nothing to do with the movie at all! Universal should have let a Halloween fan put this thing together, but instead they horsed around and didn't think about the fans. Three stars for lack of extras."
1,very disapointing sequal,"i know whoever is reading this review right now is probably saying that i am nuts but i tell it the way it is and the way i feel. halloween 2 ,after an awesome 1st 1, was very boring if i may say so. michael myers followed loari strode to the hospital to try to kill her and kills many more along the way. this movie may have some story line goin for it but not an entertaining film at all. its a continuation of part 1 and picks up right where the 1st 1 left off. mike got shot by dr.loomis and got up and walked away and halloween 2 started. this movie had the stupidest ending and michael's weapon of choice was a little scalple. come on now..mike, you can do better then that. from the kills to the setting to the crappy score(corney music) in part 2 this movie was all around pathetic. as much as most say this is a great movie , i say it isnt i think it is a big fat borefest..thats my story and i'm stickin to it."
1,The sorriest movie ever made!,I think the movie was very boring and I don't like it because it's stupid and noone can make any sense out of it.
1,WHAT!,One question that i would like to ask Mr. Carpenter. What are you thinking! this really proves horror/slasher movies can still suck. Iam now going to say why it is so bad-reason #1 Dr.Loomis shot the killer 7 times he says he shot him 6 times! Reason #2 When he killed that girl in the hot tub her towl was rapped under her arms then when he killed her she had her towl around her waste!And Jamie Lee Curtis even said she only did that movie for thr friendship on Mr.Carpenter so this movie is a ****** waste of time!
1,Halloween II is nothing but gore,"Sorry. When I saw this movie, I thought it would be good, like the first Halloween movie. It was disappointing. When Michael is supposedly left for dead at the end of the first movie, he comes back and finds that Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is staying at a nearby hospital and comes for revenge. When he gets there, he proceeds to kill almost anybody (except Laurie, Dr. Loomis, and Laurie's friend). This is had practically no suspense, except Michael jumping out of the shadows to murder somebody who gets in his way. Rated R for language and violence-related gore."
1,gutter nonsense,"The Halloween series is one of the worst film franchises in celluloid. Sreaminggg ohhhhhh ooohhhh SCREAMMM SCREECH aawwwwww SCREAM, broad screams OHH NOOOOO screams, hes alive again, oh no i killed him, he's a live again ohhhh no hes dead, no he's aliveOHHHHH GOSHHHHHHHH I'm gonna die, cue scary music, oh no he's reappeared....oh dear...more screeches and screams, horrible if any dialog, meandering incoherent babble for Donald; the score is good, and that's it and even that is well, redundant.ohh no more screams, oh the girls are screaming, the ones you hope get killed by a guy in a mask that moves slowly with a knife but somehow gets from California to lets say Boston in a few momentsI know little lemmings, little Halloween Series worshipers, it's ok, I know you think the Halloween series is terrifyingly good. I'll never see it, I see it as a joke and laughable and its gutter horror to me.Only Halloween that was good was the third one, why? Because Mike Myers wasn't in it."
1,mislead,"I thought this was the corrected version. of the Blu-ray disc. it didn't have as originally was supposed to. ""Moustapha Akkad Presents"".... also. supposedly there are deleted scenes??"
5,My favorite..,"I know this HAS to sound incredibly weird....as most people really dislike this movie as compared to the original. But in my opinion, it's the best in the series. Why? Well..read on:1. INCREDIBLE stalk scenes. Adrenaline-pounding, tension filled chase scenes best describe the movie.2. Jamie Lee Curtis. Why? Well, in the original (made in 1978), Curtis was 19, and played the role of Laurie, whom was 17. Add the fact that Halloween 2 was 3 years later but supposedly on the same night, and we have a 22-year old Jamie Lee Curtis playing someone who is 17. _5_ years, and she pulls it off.3. Donald Pleasence. Great Actor. 'Nuff said.So is Halloween 2 _REALLY_ better than the original? Well, probably not, but in my opinion, YES.Matt~"
5,IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SCARY IS,"I hate the original Halloween. The only reason I saw Halloween II is because Halloween ended whith a cliffhanger. Halloween II is better and scarier.The reason it's scarier is that it's not just that people get killed, it's the way they get killed that makes this movie scarier than Halloween.Another reason it's scarier is because Michael Myers is after his sister at her weakest moment, when she's in the hospital. So dont waste your money on Halloween (it shows the cliffhanger ending at the beginning of this movie). Just skip it and go straight to Halloween II."
5,Great for any fan,To me the extras was the best part going to the locations and to see where they filmed halloween fans love that stuff!!!!
4,A good sequal,I know most people will tell you this isn't a great horror movie but the reason they are probably saying that is that they are comparing it to the first which you can't do. This movie is no were near as good as the first but I still think it's better than all the movies in the friday the 13th and A nightmare on elm street series and I liked some of those so I have to say that this is a good movie. In this intallment in the Halloween series everyones favorite killer Michael Myers stalks Laurie stode at the hospital. There is definitely more gore and violence in this movie than in the first and so it loses the magic and suspense that the first one had. However it does still provide some scares and a good time. So this movie is a good horror movie but when your comparing it with the first it saddly turns out to be just anohter horror movie
3,HALLOWEEN TWO REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!,"hALLOWEEN TWO IS A GREAT MOVIE!iT STARTS FROM WHERE YOU LEFT OFF IN THE FIRST FILM.LAURIE STRODE FINDS OUT SHE IS MICHAELS SISTER,AND SHE IS ON THE RUN.MICHAEL HAS TRACKED HER DOWN TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL,WHERE HE NEARLY KILLS ALL OF THE PEOPLE THERE.FINALLY,LOOMIS FINDS MICHAEL AND TRIES TO KILL HIM.AT THE END ALOT WILL BE DEAD AND YOU WILL BE SCREAMING!!!!!WATCH HALLOWEEN2...........MORE OF THE NIGHT HE CAME HOME....."
3,Fun yet lesser sequel to Halloween,"Halloween II has always been fascinating to me, because it is the first sequel I ever saw that picks up literally from the last frame of the original film and does not jump forward in time. It is especially cool since it was filmed a couple years after the original, so it was not from a back to back shoot where they would have been there anyway. The film itself is not quite up to par with the original as far as suspense, it is more of a straight up slasher flick with more violent and inventive kills, but definitely missing Carpenter's ability to build suspense while providing scares. However it is still a very enjoyable sequel in comparison to the rest of the Michael Myers series, with some good performances, and an entertaining conclusion. I'd give it a 7 out of 10."
3,Average slasher movie!!!,The night continues with Jamie Lee Curtis being rushed to hospital only to find Michael Myers STILL stalking her. This sequel features more murders and gore than the original but it can drag in places. Not the best follow up but okay for fans
4,"This should have been the last ""Halloween"" movie.","Halloween II would have closed out a really good story.Michael Myers and Dr.Loomis die at the end,and Laurie survives.That should have been the end of it.But we get crappy sequel upon crappy sequel,and one film that wasn't EVEN a sequel in Halloween III.Michael Myers also gets more and more supernatural and unrealistic as the series goes on.Why couldn't they just have ended the series with this film,where Michael Myers,an ordinary psycho killer finally gets killed off.Nothing supernatural or fake,but something that could really happen.Anyway,Halloween II is a good Horror flick,taking place the same night as the first film,with Michael Myers going after his sister Laurie,once again,but this time at the hospital.The storyline is good,so is the acting.Overall,Halloween II is good,but the original is alot better.I highly recommend buying Halloween and Halloween II together and not even bothering with the terrible sequels."
4,Halloween 2 was a good follow up to the original. No chills.,"I thought Halloween 2 was a good slasher film, but it lacks the suspense, chills. and overall feeling of the firdt film. The movie has some memorable scenes, but it's mainly just blood and gore, without any story. I htought it very interesting that you finally found out thay Laurie Strode is Michael Myers' sister. This is a good follow-up to the original, because it takes place right after thr first film ends. Gore fans rejoice, this should be a top pick for you. People looking for a really good, scary date movie, find your screams and chills with Halloween."
3,Just as good as the first one,HALLOWEEN 2 picks up where part 1 ended: Lauri Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis still warming up her scream) gets sent to hospital where the unkillable Michael Myers returns to kill her. Part 1 did not have one drop of blood but this one has a little bit so if you agree with me ten this one should please you. I kinda like this film not just because it has more blood in it but also because it's a lot more funnier.
4,well done,Halloween 2 is a fantastic sequel which is a lot to say about it since most sequels (especially for horror films) tend to be lacking. I dare say that i like it just a little bit more than Halloween
3,Forced sequel,"John Carpenter and Debra Hill were 'forced' in to making Halloween 2 in order to recoupe their losses (due to legal ramblings) from Part 1.Gorier; more nudity; bad acting. You don't care for the characters here as you did in HALLOWEEN.The whole 'brother and sister' thing was thought up just for the sequel and was not a pre-existing idea by John Carpenter with the design for making a sequel; there was never a desire nor a plan to make a sequel. (This of course makes you wonder: What exactly was the motive behind Michael Myers's obsession with Laurie Strode in HALLOWEEN?)Some scary moments, but they lack the 'creepiness' of HALLOWEEN. And Michael Myers here isn't as 'human' which, (for me anyway), makes him less frightening (monsters don't scare me).Cool though how they pick up the story on the same night, right when HALLOWEEN ended."
2,"""Holds up like a ripped diaper on a fat baby""","This movie does not hold up well at all. I used to love it growing up because I was accepting what I was seeing at face value. When I forced myself to sit down and write a script for a video review of it, I found myself looking closer, and what I saw I liked less and less. The plot holes in this movie are gigantic, and for reasons unknown to me, no one else notices them. Is it because ""Halloween III"" was that much worse that this one looks so good in comparison? I guess. [...]"
2,Halloween II,"Halloween II picks up exactly where Halloween left off. It starts with a recap of the originals ending. Survivor Laurie Strode is sent to the local hospital where she is put to sleep and remains drugged for what little time she is on the screen. The main part consists of Michael Myers killing various hospital employees and Dr. Loomis's search for him. This movie is necessary in order to understand future sequels. It reveals that Laurie is Michael's sister, though writer John Carpenter admits this point came to him late one night when he had a bad case of writer's block. Halloween II contains a lot more blood and gore and feels like a regular crazy guy kills people film. From what I know, the older Goodtimes dvd, which I bought for five dollars, contains much of the same as the new Universal twenty dollar dvd. The new disc contains a new anamorphic transfer (enhanced for widescreen TV's) and a theatrical trailer, which is not very good accorging to dvdreview.com."
5,just as good as the 1st one,"Halloween is my favorite horror series. And i see no reason why anyone should hate this one and love the 1st one. This movie is alot faster than the 1st one, and even a few scenes that have you standing face to face with your tv screaming ""RUN GIRL!!!!"" halloween II is a great thiller...dont listen to all these people saying it sucks..well..if your 13 years old looking for gore gore and gore and no sense of a script just gore and 100 F words..then yeah look somewhere else.This movie is awesome"
4,A good follow-up to the original,"Along with my review of the first Halloween (Collector's edition), I must give the sequel it's due. When you consider all of the filmmaker's options for a sequel to perhaps the best horror film of all time (Halloween, 1 year later?, Halloween the next day with police involved?, Halloween III? yuck!),they could have done a lot worse. The only sequel that I can think of that picks up exactly where the first one ended, who knew the night was only half through? Very cool. Also, I forgot to mention the other effect that made this film and it's predecessor so scary. The WALK! Talk about body language! The walk that Nick Castle (Michael Myers in pt. 1) came upon almost by accident, made the character what he is. Evil, precise,& predatory. Always stalking his prey. I wouldn't go into detail about this sort of thing but if someone asked you to imitate Michael Myers, what would you do? But I digress. Halloween II is a solid sequel, more bloody yes, but not without creativity."
3,Rick Rosenthal's Halloween II,"This was a good follow up to the first Halloween. I would give this 3 and a half stars if I could. This story starts off right where the first Halloween left off. Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis) is rushed to the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, while Dr. Sam Loomis(Donald Pleasence) searches the streets for Michael Myers. When Laurie gets to the hospital, Michael shows up too and wreaks havoc in the hospital. This is problably the best sequel in the series."
4,the nightmare continues,"Even though I don't give Halloween II a 5th star because of it not being original like the first Halloween, John Carpenter did a good job with this sequel. True, Halloween II seems a bit slow at first but it really picks up and leaves the audience wondering how the injured Laurie Strode is going to get out of that hospital alive! The murders committed by Michael Myers are a bit more violent and the music to the film is a little more tense. Overall, most will enjoy Halloween II."
4,viwer,I really give this movie 4 1/2 stars. IT'S REAL COOL!!!!!1 NOT as GOOD as number 1 but still a GREAT MOVIE!!!!
2,Not quite the First Halloween!,"I thought Halloween 2 was an enjoyable movie to watch, but it was pretty stupid the more I think about it. Instead of Micheal hiding in the shadows he was always seen walking around. The overuse of blood was so opposite to the original. I still recommend this for a good scare or a good flick to watch on Halloween night."
2,A Typical Sequal,"Why do they always turn a classic into rubbish because of the lack of creativity and effort in the scripting of sequels. The story starts off with a hopeless plot of Michael Myers stalking his sister Laurie Strode (Curtis) in a local hospital. There is allot of gore and brutal death scenes, but a big lack of imagination. A real disappointment."
3,"Scary, but not as good as the first","First off, I DID like the movie, but the viewer is asked to suspend belief one too many times....mainly, that a hospital is SO dimly lit (even the halls are dark), and there are so few nurses. In one scene, Michael Myers is in a nursery full of babies and NO ONE IS WATCHING THEM. This large hospital is pretty poorly staffed! Two, Jamie Lee Curtis' parents can't be reached ALL NIGHT LONG? Wow, didn't they leave a number? A nurse and EMT find plenty of time to sneak off into a hot tub. There is only the one doctor and he vanishes. NAH........not as good or suspenseful as the first. But maybe that was an impossible task."
4,"""Good""",This movien was good and very unusual because it pivks off right where the first one left off. It is a very good sequel. I reccomend it.A good alsher film is good.I RECCOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!!Good Luck
2,"So, So...","The first was a classic. Even Rodger ""I hate Horror"" Ebert had to admit it. This is one you have to see if you're a fan of the series -- I mean you have to know what happened the rest of the night, right?? But the execution of the film was pathetic. The sharp sounds of the relentless original score is changed to a farty synth version. And all in all, it is just a generic blood fest. I think the only true sequels to the Original Halloween are this one, and the H20, but this is definately the weakest one of the three."
2,Holy Sucky Sequels Batman!,"Of course nothing can compare to the original, but they could have at least made an effort with this one. Slow and meandering with yawn-inducing kills, even part 3 is better than this!This really is a real paint by numbers job that just doesn't make sense. Not that the first one didn't have plot holes, but this thing makes it look like The Shape himself wrote the script and knew where everyone was going to be ahead of time. That or he's a real good guesser, ""Oh, Laurie must be at the hospital, even though I was busy killing some random girl down the street when the ambulance took her away...""I know we suspend our belief with horror movies, but why didn't he just go to Laurie's hospital room and kill her? Why did he have to waste his time hiding in the shadows waiting for hospital staff to kill? Just kill them on the way to her room, come on!"
2,Review #001,This movie was probably the worst sequel I've ever seen. It was a pretty bad follow up to Halloween.
4,HALLOWEEN II,"Michael Myers continues his rampage on Halloween, 1978, as he makes his way to the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital where Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is being taken care of and knows, by instinct, he is coming for her. Sensational sequel to the classic horror film is equally as scary, and even a bit darker and violent than its predecessor. Once again, performances are top-notch, screenplay is excellent, music is adapted from the original score for synth and is terrifying, and the direction by Rick Rosenthal is terrific. Possibly the best horror movie sequel ever made, HALLOWEEN II's star rating is brought down to a four because of an unnecessary slow pace at times. But it is hardly noticeable because the rest of the film is so scary and great."
5,Horror in The Hospital,"More of the night HE came home, even though his house is only in, like one scene. Jamie Lee And Donald are still great actors. This makes up for the fac the original had no blood. This one is a F@*&ing gorefest. Decent entry. They should have shown what happened to Jimmy after this one. I you can pee yourself easily, skip the deaths of Karen and Janet. A decent follow-up to the original."
3,the best sequel,this is the best sequel i am giving it three because of its lack of decent specail feutures but the movie i give 4 stars.
4,Halloween II,"I always thought the film company putting out these DVDs should put out a special edition of the HALLOWEEN movies where they combine numbers one and two to make ONE epic film since the second one picks up directly where the first one leaves off.Anyway, this is one of my favorite horror sequels. It has the same great music of the first film. It has Michael and Laurie, and a whole bucketload of blood. Horror enthusiasts will not be disappointed."
5,GREAT,"Before buying I did my reserch on the Webb. First choice was this generator. Then came the question where to buy. After going to many sites and checking, Amazon came out on top. Amazon did everything they claimed they would do. Generator arrived at my front door without any problem. Since I had n/gas the set was hooked up at cost of about 244 including a rebate . Next because of codes in Brevard cty Fl had a Guardian dealer to install per code. cost about 1,800. Set has ran its test cyle now for several weeks and performed a electric failure test at installation. Everything worked well on the 16 circuits I picked to operate. I am very pleased and just hope I never have to use it. If you plan to purchase a set , this is the one!. .. Last thing the gas contractor who is very busy installing the gas hook up said this generator is running about 5 to 1 of all gen sets they are hooking up."
4,Fantastic,"A great CD, with excellent music. Bela is, as always, fantastic, and Curandero are top notch. Not at all bluegrass tinged, unlike ""Tabula Rasa"", which Fleck also took part in."
4,simple but amazing still.......,"Who knew that one man, a set of drums, a guitar, and a piano/synthesizer could generate such richness? A throw back to before-modern times, Michael Andrew's ""Hand On String"" captures the lo-fi, hazy, beautifully simple spirit of the past (1960's -70's). Inverted, intimate, and reflective all at the same time, Andrews' musical arrangements are complicated enough to trip you out, but simple enough to compute. The underlined tone of the album is a gentle one; each song moving along the current, soaking up and then releasing the river of ambiance Mike has placed them in. Those who have been intrigued by his film score credits will appreciate hearing what the man has to say. Although he has not a lot to say, what he does say further vivifies his beautiful craft."
2,THE EDITORAL SUMMARY IS MISLEADING,"The review above says it contains ""review of all the subjects"" included in the OAT. THAT IS NOT TRUE. I REPEAT:THERE ARE NO REVIEW SECTIONS IN THIS BOOK.The Kaplan OAT, 2007-2008 version is no different than the previous ones. It only contains practice questions / tests. THAT IS ALL.If you want to actually have a study guide type book don't waste your money here. I guess your best best is to buy the MCAT comprehensive review.Oh well, I guess I have yet ANOTHER OAT book full of practice questions and no real guided method of review."
3,OAT,"Used this a bit for studying for OAT, and I did not find it that helpful. The test questions were much harder than what I found on the test and stuff I had never learned in the courses. Really didn't learn anything from it. Better to just review your individual courses, thats what I did."
5,Excellent Kaplan Book,"Must buy for Optometry Admission Test(OAT).Book has excellent sections on chemistry, organic chemistry, and biology. I also would study a good biology textbook like Campbell's biology and a good study guide like The Ultimate Study Guide for Biology: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations by Patrick Leonardi..Volume1, Volume 2 & Volume 3.These study guides had fantastic questions that were helpful for studying for the biology segment of the OAT."
5,This Man is Badd !!,"WOO,What can I say but this guy is FIRE the whole album is HOT and it also has a song towards the RICH MAN called ""MONEY"" which is a must hear.Run and go get this album,when you hear awesome Contemporary Hip Hop Gospel there is really no need for secular Hip Hop like the Jim Jones,Camrons and the bleeks.Flame and Da Truth albums are much better than anything I have heard from The Cross Movement camp it seems that their solo artist are aiming more towards the younger people and are really trying to save souls and give THIRST to know more about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ which is awesome,Keep up the good work CM and I look forward to more.God Bless,"
2,Mid West Flow,"Your enjoyment of this album wiil be influenced by your Love of Mid west Hip hop. What can not be denied is the lyrical prowress of Flame, or of the production, and CD packaging. As a Man who is more East coast sounding, a few of these cuts, musically didn't register with me. Fav cuts Give us the truth:Form the east to the Midwest."
5,New Love for Rap Music,"After turning my life over to Christ, I gave up listening to secular music, especially rap. After investing in FLAME (I actually bought it for my son), I now have a new found love for rap music. FLAME is truly anointed and does a wonderful job of combining the gospel w/hip-hop.I recommend this to anyone."
5,Listen up!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS GOOD! The tracks are tight and the gospel is flowing from each one. My two favorites are ""Like Christ"" and ""Money"". Hey but everything on this album is on point. If you ain't got it you better get because this dude be BRINGIN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,HOT!!,"If there was a way I could give this CD 10 stars....I would!!This CD is ""straight off tha cross""...The beats are HOT...the Lyrics are....words can't even explain....Truly Holy Spirit inspired!! I would recommend this CD...Check it out you will not be disapointed..."
1,This guy isnt a christian,"In the track ""Real One"" he starts bashing Pentecostals and stating that ""it might get hostile"". I am pentecostal but someone who was a real christian would not spit lyrics like this in a track."
3,Falls a little short,"I ordered this volume anticipating that it would be as interesting as it's sister volume ""The Most Scenic Drives in America"" which I would recomend highly.""Off the Beaten Track"" would be of interest to someone who perhaps hadn't done as much domestic travel as we have. For someone who's looking for a guide for unique sights and items off the beaten track I would recomend ""Road Trip USA"" by Jamie Jensen as a more valuable and interesting resource in this regard.It's typical Reader's Digest high quality printing and presentation with just a bit too ""plain vanilla"" content for this traveler."
4,Handy travel guide,"this book is great for people who want a starting point when looking to travel in and around the 50 states. It gives you a brief description of each point of interest, both beautiful and/or historic and a detailed map of the state to help plan a travel route. It is a little big and heavy, but I think worth the look through."
3,an OK film,"Extremely bad soundtrack, painful to listen to and completely out of synch with what is going on on the screen. Lots of TGR-like shots with skier no bigger than a little dot on the screen, lots of interrupted sequences. Worth buying but do not anticipate much. Stupid insets with retarted humor (apart from title piece).Serious upset after 5-star Global Storming."
4,"Ski Movie - The follow up to last years ""Global Storming""","Ski Movie is not released yet. But last years DVD from the same company ""Global Storming"" is first rate Snow Porn! If the new flick is at least as good as GS, it's a solid ""BUY"" recamendation from this snow junkie. I give Global Storming 4 stars."
4,Ski Movie the ultimate footage of the new school era.,"Are you looking for a ski film that will give big moutain cliff drops, amazing jumps in the park and, smoothe rail slides this is the video for you. Ski movie combines a solid action packed ride through skiing evolution. There is plenty of big mountain alaska lines and huge BC cliff drops with super stars like JT Holmes and Seth Morrison. The jib footage is one of a kind with everything from Vincent Dorion and Johnny Mosley grinding rails downtown to Skogen Spranf throwing aley-oop flatspin 540's in the pipe. With a great soundtrack and loads of energy this is the ski video for you."
2,Great premise; poor execution,"Being a life long Texas Rangers fan, through their ups and downs (and downs and downs and downs), I thought this book would be very interesting. It WAS interesting, but I found Shropshire's smart-aleck style of writing so annoying that I couldn't finish the book. Some of it was so smarmy and self-consciously 'witty' that I wanted to throw the book across the room. Many of the anecdotes ARE humorous, but not enough to make me recommend this book. The entire tone is like a smart-aleck sports article, which, of course, is what Shrop makes his living writing. I think part of the fault lies with the editor, because there are some good stories in here--Billy Martin, Whitey Herzog, etc. Parts of this would probably make a decent movie."
2,This book flames out worse than David Clyde's career,"I'm a life long Rangers fan, but this book was weaker than I had hoped. I was hoping for a great read. It showed promise early, but then flamed out much like Ranger's rookie phenom David Clyde in 1973. Shropshire spends more time trying to be witty and failing than he does in writing well about these teams or their characters. In fact, the 1974 team had the Cy Young runner-up (Fergie Jenkins), the MVP (Jeff Burroughs), and the AL ROY (Mike Hargrove.) The club also finished in 2nd place. Only an old drunk like Shropshire could think of them as the worst team in baseball. Ultimately, Shropshire tries too hard and too often to be another Jim Bouton in Ball Four (he goes on and on about his drinking), but he strikes out. Phil Rogers's ""The Impossible Takes A Little Longer"" is a better book about the Texas Rangers and their history (both good and bad.)"
4,The Texas Strangers,"The Texas Strangers--that's what the Lone Star State called the team in the 80s. And despite making the playoffs a couple of times recently (only to be swept by the Yankees), the team's legacy of frustration, futility, and fumbling continues to this day. What _Seasons_in_Hell_ succeeds in doing is reminding everyone old enough to remember just how much progress the Rangers have made.Once you accept how bad the Rangers were, this book becomes delightful, and in some cases, laugh-out-loud funny. Hearing Whitey Herzog's evaluations of his charges are hilarious; Shropshire's account of Ten Cent Beer Night in Cleveland should be required reading for any student of the game. This book is not literature, but is a first hand look at the underbelly of the game of baseball as played by the underdogs--sort of like a cross between Ball Four and Hunter S. Thompson.A perfect introduction to the ""culture"" of baseball."
2,only half of product,Only half of this product came it show whole le bre bottom 4 frnt bumper did not come im a real customer and feel lik I got half way cheated!!!!! IM KINDA PISSED I BEEN BAMBOSOLED
1,Returned,Did not need product. Too many wires and connections required for installation not described by literature . Store accepted the return
2,Requires Pro Installer,"The base station, along with the mx850 remote, require the services of a professional installer unless your do-it-yourself skills are exceptionally advanced."
3,Not what I was expecting,"It is nice, but I was disappointed to find that it was completely romanized. I'll find some use from it though. If you want a romanized Japanese dictionary, this would probably be good for you though."
3,Enjoyable art theft thriller,"Nice beach read. I enjoyed the story of the nasty Germans stealing this revered treasure during World War II, the amoral purchase on the black market, and then the young people caught up in a chase initiated by their ancestors during the war.I also enjoyed it under it's other name, The Amber Room.Oh, were those two different books? Huh."
1,Not Worth Reading,"The author fails to answer the most obvious question that readers have; ""Why should I care?"" Having failed at that, his story is tedious, the characters forgetful, and the central ""quest"" bla bla bla. This is a tale full of sound and fury signifying nothing. Read a book by Buffa and be thoroughly entertained."
3,"Good, but not great","I found this slow to get through. Many of the characters are known by more than one name, which was confusing, and I didn't feel I got to really know any of the characters well. Moreover, there were points I wasn't certain I cared. There were opportunities for the story to really draw the reader in, but they just weren't realized. Finally, you learned the true importance of the icon in the last quarter of the story but it was a long time getting there. The book is good but, for me, it's not a page turner and it could have been so much better"
4,Full of wonderful ideas!,I love this book as it gives some great new ideas on using the old classic 'storm at sea' block. The color pictures provide lots of inspiration and the instructions are written so that quilters of all levels can understand them. A great addition to any quilters library.
4,"Great sound! If you like Micheal Hedges, you'll love it!","This guy can really play! If you like Hedges, youre going to love this disk! The technical skill this guy has is pretty amazing! He uses a lot of fret board work which sounds really cool!"
4,"Replacement part, identical to missing piece","If you're buying this, you're probably replacing a lost one, like me. (Although, I can see the value in adding one to a boat cover that had no such vent in the first place. They work and are better than cleaning mildew off your vinyl, enough said on that.) My only complaint is that the cost (and add shipping) is sky high for a simple piece of plastic. To reduce shipping, order more from Overton's to make it worth it. Also, there are coupon codes (like 20% off total order) in Overton's catalogs if you order enough. Even with the cost, it's better than not having one."
3,Not the best,"I am a horse freak and bought the movie cause it was cheap and about horses (I have the DVD version) It was not the greatest movie I have ever seen and the sound quality seemed poor to me at times (then again, I was really sick when I watched it)"
3,My Chaps denim shirt,It's a nice looking shirt. The thing I like most about it is that it does not have buttons. It has snaps which are much easier to use. The top snap does not choke me.The sleeves are a bit longer than on my other medium shirts.
2,"Looks nice, but does not whistle","We purchased one of these and really liked it until about 2 weeks later, when the whistle became very quiet and within a few days it stopped whistling at all! We returned it for another one, took it out of the box, and it barely whistled. It looked like steam was escaping from the lid at the top of the kettle. We researched kettles for some time before deciding on this one, and were very happy with our old Revere kettle, which died after several years (due to user error). We've tried this one and one other Revere model, and unfortunately we're back to the drawing board again."
2,disappointing - not the kettle I remembered,"We had an earlier version of this kettle in my childhood home - a big heavy workhorse that easily handled a family of seven. This one is smaller, lighter-gauge, and has an unfortunate dribble issue when pouring out the boiling water. It also has a kludgy fill-cap that gets harder to operate as the minerals that remain in the water, even after filtering, collect on the circular opening and cap (visible in image under the handle), making it a real chore to open the thing to fill it. The trigger mechanism on the spout, that is supposed to stay in the 'up' position if you want, often doesn't stay there. Overall, a disappointment. I'm waiting for one of my kids (or me, in a rare inattentive moment) to overboil it or melt the spout or somehow damage it so I can justify replacing this rather expensive and lesser kettle. Revere Ware just isn't a guaranteed brand any more, not since they started using cheaper materials and producing most of their items in China."
2,Whistle broke within month,I had a similar experience to another poster here in that the whistle stopped working a very short time after purchasing. The problem appears to be with the fit of the easy fill lid. It allows steam to leak - which doesn't allow enough pressure to build up behind the whistle at the spout. I've also noticed a crack in the plastic below the spout on the front - which has appeared in the last week (no steam is coming from there).I have a 5 year old easy fill kettle that worked fine until it's untimely user-caused demise - so I'd say that there is something wrong with a particular batch of these produced in the last year or so that has ill-fitting lids and construction not up to Revere's usual high standards. AVOID the trouble and get a different Revere kettle without the easy fill lid.
2,Green Rust?,Very nice kettle. The outside copper bottom has started to show green 'rust spots.' I have only used the kettle twice. I will get some copper cleaner and see if that works.
3,Travel and Information,"I have been planning an Italian trip for this summer and have made some use of this book. While it was useful it was like using a catalogue but there was limited detail on the mundane aspects of travel. Which railway station, how are the tickets handled and more. For these details I used Rick Steves' Italy. I felt that he had actually been to the places he discussed.It is as one might expect, no one book gives you all you need for planning a trip. The proof will be in how the trip goes. It is 100% planned by ""moi"".PS Could the publishers of travel books please stop making them so heavy? It is good to take these books on the trip, but the weight becomes a problem."
2,"Good basic info, but no map of the Metro? Skip it","I bought the book for it's portability and was disappointed when I found there was no map of the Metro included, which meant I needed to bring the Milan (big DK book) instead. Gives a basic overall view of Milan, but not enough details to make it THE book you'll use. I recommend using Zani Viaggi bus tour with guaranteed Last Supper viewing if you're short on time and didn't buy tickets to Last Supper well in advance. Also the tourist info place near the Duomo was helpful."
5,Great Movie,I am so happy I bought this DVD. It is very interesting. The Gorillas are too cute and loving. I liked the scene when the mom is laying on the ground and her baby is in her arms relaxing. The researchers are even being loved by the gorillas. Good thing I wasn't there. If one of the gorillas sat in my lap hugging me I wouldn't be able to help but hug the gorilla back. I'm very interested in the scene where the poor dog was trapped in a gorilla trap set up by the villager's. The gorillas tried to help him out. Thank goodness the researchers where there to help the dog get loose after the gorillas gave up.
1,Misleading,"The cover art of this DVD totally mislead this reviewer. The girl on the cover is not in this movie. Then, on the back of the cover it states ambiguously that a New York City high price call girl and model makes her movie debut and it makes one think it's the girl on the cover (She's even on the cover art on the disc itself!). Finally, the film itself is a grade-B semi-erotic thriller about an ill-fated ménage à trois set in a ski cabin and the viewer will be waiting for that girl on the cover to show up and it never happens. Overall, a waste of time."
2,SIX- MONTH -BREAKDOWN,"I PURCHASED THIS HOME SYSTEM FROM MY LOCAL STORE. IT WORKED GREAT FOR SIX MONTHS, THEN STOPPED WORKING. THE SURROUND SOUND WAS GREAT FOR SUCH A LOW PRICE."
4,Good system for small space,"This system is pretty much what I expected from reading prior reviews. It works well and does the job although it does not give ""theatre sound"" to a large room. Speakers work best with CDs than with the TV as the volume only goes to 50 and in a large room, that is far from booming. Overall, for the price, a great system. Love the 5 CD/DVD changer."
3,Sweet shirt - TOOK FOREVER,"This product was very cool, but the shipping took almost 3 weeks. I actually ordered it for a gift for someone who was in the hospital, and it didn't actually come until well after the person was home."
2,No Results,"I took it for almost 3 weeks and didn't see any increase what so ever. I would buy from this seller again, but no results from this product for me."
1,Did not work,My wife bought this while trying to regain her milk production after an infection. It did not make any noticeable change. Definitely didn't work.
1,Wrong Product Received,"I received the More Milk Plus, not the Goat's Rue capsules (which is what I ordered). We had already been using most of the herbs in the more milk plus so I was very disappointed and am in the process of trying to get them to send me the Goat's Rue. We needed this quickly and now will have to wait another two weeks. Unfortunate."
1,Doesn't work for me=(,"Unfortunately, this product did not help me in increasing milk supply at all. I wrote down how much I pumped each day for two weeks before I used these and continued to keep track of how much I pumped after I started. I followed the instruction and finished a whole bottle but it did not make a difference in my milk supply. I'm glad that it works for others but too bad it doesn't work for me. Brown rice actually works better for me and it's way cheaper."
2,It did not work for me.,"I really wanted to produce enough milk for my new baby. This was one of the last supplements that I have tried and sad to say it did not make any difference in my milk production. I now think I have a problem with insufficent mamary glands so that may be why it could not help. It may work for someone else but, in my case it did not."
1,Doesn't work!,this stuff is WAY to expensive and did NOTHING for me. I stuck to the regimen for over 3 weeks and my milk supply did not increase. What works is Barley water and Fenugreek while taking More Milk Plus. Barley water is easy to make. Buy pearlized barley. Steep it in simmering water for 2 hours (6 cups water to every one cup barley). The water will be pink and slimy. You drain the water off and drink that. I drink a cup every morning.
3,Can't tell....,"I have hypothyroidism and PCOS so I have supply issues. I took this in conjunction with More Milk Plus and Fenugreek....I can't tell how much this alone would work, but I think it helped me some. I will probably not buy another bottle."
4,Description of Use,"I love the Motherlove products. However, buying on Amazon can be a challenge because it does not list what each breastfeeding product is designed to for. Here's the description for Motherlove's website:An alcohol free liquid concentrate in vegetarian capsules. Discovered in Europe, goat's rue is one of the most potent herbs known to increase breast milk and stimulate the development of mammary tissue. This formula helps women who did not increase in breast size during pregnancy, have had previous breast surgeries and adoptive mothers. Discuss product use with a healthcare professional before using during pregnancy."
5,Great!,"Another excellent Schleich figure. Very detailed, and durable!Note that if he were to get thrown around on hard surfaces, he could get scratched up.5 star toy!!!"
3,Fairly entertaining,"Loved the scenes sans the shirt... worth every other bland minute in my very humble opinion.Look it takes a lot of work out of a multitude of people to make a movie, and a good bit of those folks have far better skills than I when it comes to acting, directing and photography - all I thought was fairly good. However, I felt the powerful overhang of morals almost more than a mere suggestion. And in my experience that smacks of subcontextual meaning that might not line up with how I feel.You really want something to curl your toes? Go watch Irreversible, it's a Prime movie on Amazon right now... (or at least they were).Another to check out Following directed by Chris Nolan.Irreversible (English SubtitledFollowing"
1,YAWN! Didn't even finish.,"I can usually find some good in any film. That being said, this was a HUGE waste of money and time. I was in the mood for a sweet/sentimental movie so I chose this one. What I got was an extremely boring, horribly acted, overly-priced made for t.v. movie. Please, please, please don't waste your time. I didn't even bother finishing it(that never happens to me)."
1,TerrIble Movie,Don't make the mistake of watching this movie. Terrible acting especially Lutz and Greene. Hoping it sould be a good lacrosse movie. Do check out Crooked Arrows instead!
3,it was ok,"this movie was ok ,my kids like it, my daughter want to buy the movie, i would watch it again."
3,Not bad,"Considering I bought this movie on a whim and didn't know anything about it, I thought it was ok. Typical love story but I like the father son relationship that it covers. Sweet movie."
2,If you want to understand End Times...,"A Case for Amillennialism: Understanding the End Timesby Kim Riddlebarger is the best book going on End Times. Escape the craziness for good, and buy this book. Hopefully, you'll get that ""Finally it all makes sense"" understanding of what the scriptures tell of the End Times."
3,not new,There were writings in the book from the previous owner and that was not said before my purchase or I would have gotten another copy.
2,Not Worth the Price,"I remember this show from my younger years, and loved it. However, I have a problem with the way the DVD Release is being handled. 12 discs for 7 episodes? Do we really care for or need an extensive documentary for each episode.? Not to mention the lousy editing and complete deletion of an actor's role? Each set will also set you back roughly $75. At this rate, it will cost over two hundred dollars to own the show. No thanks."
1,Greed over Fairness,"Well, I too am a fan and WAS going to purchase these sets. HOWEVER, after reading of ANOTHER case of Cheap Packaging, cut-up episodes and fowl product, I refuse to pay their OUTRAGEOUS price for a half-a**ed product!"
1,Mala informacion de Amazon,"Amazon provee mala informacion, dice que viene con idioma en español entre otros y solo viene en inglés. Como esperan que confiemos en lo que ofrecen si dan informacion errada."
3,NOT SUITABLE FOR YOUNG VIEWERS,"I was so surprised to find that the set is not suitable for young viewers. Disc one was really good. Disc two,which is as far as I've gotten, has female nudity pictured through art and with a young woman, who is posing nude with her back end showing. Parents don't purchase for your children unless you intend to preview it and then watch with supervision with the remnote in hand. Shame on you George Lucas."
1,This is bad!,This is a complete rip off. I was running over as fast as I could to buy this and the saw the ridicules price. Forget about it! Everyone save your money and rent it on netflix.
3,Good Set,The set is nice. Although I think it would have been better if the original episodes were included instead of the way they were edited together. It needs spanish subtitles also.
4,More Indiana Jones is always a good thing...,"This series is nowhere near as exciting as the movies, however, they do add some interesting chapters into the life of the character. There is definitely a Forrest Gump kind of feel to the way Indy experiences (and influences) moments in history and meets historical figures. It helps explain why Indy is such a worldly person, with a respect for all cultures, languages, and ethnic groups. One of the great things about Indiana Jones is that he is not only an action hero, but he is also very intelligent. This series attempts to explain how Indy became the kind of dramatic hero he is in the movies. You can't argue about the locales George Lucas chooses for the settings in this series, which were primarily shot on-location. It can be a bit dull at times, with more history lessons than Indy being Indy, but if you are a fan of Indiana Jones, this is the first of a series that you will enjoy..."
3,Mixed Bag,"I held off a long time before buying this set because the price was ridiculously high, considering how little was on it, but gave in when the price fell enough. I was rather disappointed. There was a lot of sadness in these stories, and I wept often. I guess I was expecting more emphasis on the adventure, like the Indiana movies. The writing was decent, but the most jarring thing was the lack of focus. Backgrounds and many of the shots were out of focus, especially noticeable when they shifted from one camera to another. Other tv shows manage to keep things focused and sharp (Monk for example.) One watching was probably enough."
2,Disappointed,I LOVED this TV show when it aired... I was so excited to hear that it was finally being released on DVD. Unfortunately I am SO disappointed in this set (like other people). Yes the packaging is cheap - but the editing is horrible! I was so confused by the first episode! It was cut so confusing - I thought I had some kind of damaged DVD. The stories do not remotely go together (Egypt and the pharohs then slaves and the sultan?) - and the episodes are not as they aired on TV - many details and the logical story lines are completely lost or ignored. Be warned!
1,What a Huge Disappointment,"I Loved this series. I Loved the TV movies that followed. I even was able to see the three that ran on LIFETIME instead of ABC.These sets are a travesty. Why not just realese the series as it aired, then follow-up with the TV movies? What a waste of good material.I'm sticking with my off-air recordings, even if one episode never aired complete."
4,A Fantastic Series,"This was a great series, and I've long hoped for its dvd release. Though overpriced at the moment, at least it's available, so I'll keep an eye out for the eventual (inevitable) complete series box set. In the meantime, there's always the local rental place.Young Indie was my favorite show when it originally aired, and I've retained very fond memories of it ever since. It's nice to see that, though the amount of documentaries included here borders on the absurd, it is getting a full treatment and is not just some rush-job release-it-and-forget-it package that often happens with long-discontinued series.Young Indiana Jones episodes are filled with all the action, humor, and intelligence you could hope for, and, best of all, (cheezy and clichéd as this is to say) it really is fun for all ages."
5,Tour de force,"The new Young Indiana Jones dvds are a true tour de force. The dramas themselves are smart, fun, and engaging. The additional material, however, is really dazzling, especially from a teaching/learning perspective. Although schools will be challenged to use them -- because of the length of the materials and the rigidity of school schedules -- it's interesting to imagine what schools and learning could be like for students if schedules did allow for this kind of content! LucasFilms should receive huge kudos for going the extra mile (and a few dozen more!) to show how video adventure and educational resources can be combined to offer young learners -- and not so young! -- compelling insight into history, biography, and science. A truly wonderful series!"
5,A tour de force! Bravo!,"In a nutshell, these dvds are a treasure.I have watched all three volumes with my third-grader son, and we both enjoyed every episode tremendously. This is the most enjoyable movie series I've ever watched. Some adventures are on the campy side, some very historical, some filled with eye-candy females, some non-stop action, all with the common denominator of either exotic foreign locales or lovely recreations of main-street America, and all undergirded by very inventive storylines."
3,Will this be from the TV series??,"The TV series had an ""old"" Indiana Jones beginning and ending the stories of the adventure that tied the story with something going on in old Indys life at the moment (attending an Art auction, he tells the story of meeting Degas and Picasso--looking at a picture taken during the Russian Revolution, he tells the story of the false spring before Lenin seized power). They really made the series and it was touching when he tells of his first love and being rejected and the episode ends with him hugging his lost love as they are both very old but Indy has tears in his eyes. If anyone knows if this will be the format, I'm there. If not, I have the VHS tapes."
1,Worst idea ever.,"Why would anyone do this. Last time I checked this was supposed to be a series, not a hack-up, pieced together badly done series of movies. It makes no sense to me to ruin a perfectly good series. Not to mention leaving out an actors performance, getting rid of the old Indy bookends ruins this series and insults the actor (Who pasted away). I hope Lucusfilms wises up and bring this series out as it once was. I know I will not be buying this movie series, it's just not ""the young Indiana Jones chronicles""."
3,good but has flaws,entertaining good story great locations.changed from the series in soooo many waysgood just not the same
4,another way of looking at the $,"I remember what a gorgeous show this was. An absolutely top-notch production. (Sure wish they could have produced in widescreen back then!) I have very little interest in the extras, although I may be surprised, so I kind've wish they weren't there and the $ was lower. But, that said, there will be 7 wonderful, fun, attention-grabbing episodes, and if I look at it as mini movies of a VERY family-friendly nature that's barely over $10 each. IMHO I think it will be a good entertainment value over-all."
3,Indiana Jones: The Beginning!!!,"In the beginning, you see how Indy starts his world-wide journey with his parents. He is almost sold into slavery, he is always getting into trouble, his smokin' hot mom almost had an affair, he and his dad settle their problems with each other, and he grows older! I bought this the night after I graduated on May 31st, 2008. If you like Indiana Jones and prequel series, you might like THE ADVENTURES OF YOUNG INDIANA JONES VOLUME ONE - THE EARLY YEARS!!!"
3,Think I'll stick with the tapes,"This is sad, no George Hall, no intro and outros for the episodes' music. All this editing has diluted the integrity of the original broadcasts. If they changed the ending of the feature length version of Travels With Father (aired on FAM in 1998) that means the whole blow-up between Indy and his dad that closes the episode is gone. Indy returns from his travels and his dad totally gives him the cold shoulder.I hate to say this but I think the bootleg DVDs circulating on the net are a better choice for collectors. They are the original airings. That's sad that the official release is not the original single 45 min episodes.I'm glad I already have the official VHS tapes sold back in the late 90s.I guess I'll put my money toward Heroes and Jericho instead.*sigh*"
4,Coming of Age,"I'm glad this series has finally come out in DVD, but there are issues with this set. As other reviewers have mentioned the ""old Indy"" who bookended the series and provided perspective is not included. Another issue of mine are the special features which remind me of educational films of my grade school days (boring!), these could have been done much better. However, all in all I do enjoy the adventure set against historical background."
3,"History and adventure, but some disappointment",Glad to have this series. We enjoy how the story lines blend with historical events and people and teach geography and social studies mixed with adventure!I'm not thrilled that two stories were attempted to be tied together. Events in one story are not important to the next story so the transitions are noticably 'independent' of the original scripts. Also didn't care for the transition sequences because Indy often is noticably older. The 25 minute historical extras are great for those who enjoy history. The story lines are enjoyable and educational so the benefits outweigh the inconsistencies.
5,Priceless.,"This is TV as it's best. I remember enjoying the series back then and I will make sure I enjoy it again with my kids.As for all of you complaining about price and extras. Just think if you are a parent that many of our kids don't have a vision of what the 20th century was, some of them don't even have a concept of WWII. If they can watch the documentaries on this set and learn about Roosevelt and Edison instead of reciting by heart the names of all Pokemon characters I say this set is priceless."
1,Overpriced DVD sets that have been split to maximize prifits,You can see how the Lucas Empire Strikes Back at the fans that made it. Release a DVD set at a pace to publicise the new Indy Jones film AND maximize the sales profit of this old TV series by splitting it up and selling pieces of the set each a few months apart. I guess I'll wait for the price to come down and all parts are released. Then they'll bundle it with more extras(like Spielberg did with the Jurassic Park trilogy). Can these sales marketers at Lucasfilm and Paramount get any more greedy?
3,A bit of a let down,"I would prefer to give a 3 1/2 stars rating, because there is a lot to like in this set, but the awful editing, the lack of the Old Indy bookends, and the cheap packaging detract from my enjoyment. Would it really have been so difficult to present the episodes that were not originally part of a two-hour movie on their own? The glaringly obvious difference in Corey Carrier's age, particularly in ""My First Adventure"", is distracting and the awkwardness of bridging some of the episodes into a two-hour movie format is painful. That being said, I don't hate the set. I still enjoy the shows, the video quality is very good, and the extras are interesting. I wish there was some material on the making of the show itself, in addition to the historical documentaries. As a fan of the show, I am happy to have these DVDs, but I can't help but be a bit disappointed with the presentation."
3,Ehh,"They were ok for the price, but I ended up returning them and spending the extra $40 for a pair of Rock GT-50's. Seller was great, the skates just weren't as good as I wanted. Particularly the bearings and wheels"
1,Disposable skates,"I bought these for roller derby, and within two months I had the outer quarter of the leather upper blow out on me through a turn. These are glued more than stitched together. They weren't the most comfortable pair of skates either: They broke down before they broke in.Anyhow, if you are looking to get in to a skating sport, I suggest you rent skates before buying (just to see if you like it) and then splurge on a great pair--not these."
5,Great Retro Episodes with THE LOOK--Fun fun fun-,I have not seen these episodes in years and cannot wait to watch them with my little boy--The mastery of these puppets are amazing... Very cool retro look that nothing else can duplicate-YOu will never see anything like it ever again.. Great storylines and well wooden performances but what fun!!
5,Hauntingly beautiful,"A work to explore a man's woman-like qualities... This particular CD has become one of my all time favorites. The music is hauntingly beautiful, but somewhat sad sounding. The interweaving improvisations of Native American flute, sax, oboe, and others are just amazing. Well worth your dollars!"
4,Gem of a Whodunnit,"An extraordinary thriller centring around the heroine, Elise Andrioli, who has been left blind, mute and quadriplegic as a result of an IRA bomb in Northern Ireland.Back home in France, Elise leads a sedentary and solitary life and when a number of murders of boys take place, she is befriended by a little girl, Virginie, who confides that she has witnessed the murders. This sets the scene for an unusual and intriguing whodunnit. Elise, a very different heroine, is fabulously witty and sarcastic in the manner she relates to the reader her thoughts and opinions on the characters she comes into contact with.Its a creepy, spine-chilling, roller-coaster of a book and one which I enjoyed immensely. This book is highly recommended."
4,Excellent Book: Poor Translation,"I read and enjoyed this book in its French version and then again in the English version, and I have to say that a lot was lost in translation. In some passages Koral's version is barely better than Google Translate. He makes little attempt to make the English version stylistically work. Some parts are too literal and earn the dreaded English teacher's comment, ""Awk"". It needed a good editor stateside."
3,not as natural as I'd hoped,I had ordered this product in search of a brand that didn't use wheat or corn syrup in the product. Couldn't tell from the website but this product does contain one or both - can't remember now - but couldn't use unfortunately. If you don't care about the processing I am sure this is a fine product.
3,CHRISTIAN TAROT? or was it Jewish,"I have read some of the other reviews - sadly after I purchased the book. It is great for learning Minor - BUT the monotheistic prayers blew my mind - Our father in heaven? It confused me, and as a pagan I decided to try and rework them but ended up just writing my own. I wish it said all of this on the back of the book. I am passing it down to a Christian friend who has a minor interest in the Tarot. SO if you are pagan do not expect this book to be your style!"
2,Good parts and Bad parts,"This book will give you a good idea of what Connally was hoping to do with this deck. If you are reading with this deck, you may find some of the mentors helpful, though I think the court mentors are a bit weak. The exercises for becoming familiar with the energies of the different cards are also helpful. At the end of the book, she explains a few different spreads, which is helpful for beginniners.I had a hard time getting over some of the religious overtones, as I am not Christian, and they tended to clash with my worldview. (Basically I rewrote all of her meditations.) Also, I disagree with her fundamental keys for the suits. Example: I have always seen wands as concerning spiritual matters, while she uses ""enterprise and distinction"" as the suit key. I also had some issues with her ideas about time and season cards.I would strongly advise looking at a copy of this book prior to purchasing it."
3,Tarot Reading,The insight on the Tarot is useful in this book. I do not like the way the card interpretations are written. They are very short and sometimes hard to understand the true meanings. It is helpful learning the different spreads and symbols on the cards. I use this book when doing a reading if I need another point of view. This would not be one I use alone for a reading.
4,Pricey but good,"Maybe it is just me but I was kinda expecting something I could rip out of book on heavy card stock to use as flash cards. While the information is presented in the book in the form of flash cards, you're still supposed to do the Q&A in the book itself as there is no perforations and the pages won't last long if you cut them up yourself. Other than that, the material is good and should work well to prep you for the exams."
1,Worst Skinhead Oi! ever,"Boring, boring, nothing to say. Those guys have no clue, they look like a bunch of goons, every single song has an oi! oi! oi! chant or a skinhead! shout, it's a real embarrassment to all of us. But then again they're from Delaware. I certainly get the impression that they would do much better as an RAC band, 'cause no matter how hard they try, they still sound like boneheads to me."
2,Wish it lasted longer,"I love the features on this camera. I love the weight, the cost, the lenses and the photo quality. One *big* problem. It broke down during my son's 3rd birthday party. The camera was only a year and a half old. It cost me $ to repair it. I can't recommend a product with this kind of reliability."
4,Feng Shui Chic is Fun!,This book shows us ALL how to lighten up a little! It is fun to read and encourages one of the most important things to have in life - a positive attitude. I found the book and it's colorful techniques wonderfully uplifting.
1,Alot of whimsical rhetoric,Do not waste your money on this book. Charts were confusing!! Choose another author that knows what they are talking about.
4,Sci Fi adventure of man's near future.,"This is a short novel about man's near future when we encounter the ""Galactic Empire"" we are a lost colony of. More fantasy adventure than sci fi, this is a quick read and would be good for the reader looking for a break from Star Trek/Star Wars novels."
1,"Beware, some television is now copy protected and cannot be recorded with this","Purchased this unit form Walmanrt as a tempoary fix for time shifting TV till I can find a perminant place to live and reinstall my DIsh Network dish and DVR. Using plain old antenna with analogue broadcast TV. Many shows that I have been recording and watching the next day on Dish DVR for years will not record on this unit. Called manufacturer and they informed me that many shows are copy protected and will not record on this unit - records commercials only. For me, this unit has absolutly no value if it cannot time shift TV."
2,"It works, but keep shopping","We had the prior model (the 3550, I believe), and it was far more user-friendly and had better features. But, it developed a problem with the outputs and had to go. We were not impressed with Philips and how the warranty issues were handled, but we were hooked on the HDD DVR. There are so few on the market that we decided to give them another chance with this one (plus the upconversion and HDMI are nice). But, BEWARE. This one now has a glitch in the output, causing it to flicker and then have a line of off-set picture scroll about 1/3 of the way up the screen. Obviously we are not pleased. I don't know what the deal is with this, and if you need an HDD DVR I'm not sure what the other options are. But, consider these repetitive output issues with the Philips and consider other options."
1,junk,"after having 3 dvd recorders fail after less than one year, I have no right to be suprised when this unit's DVD tray refused to open the first time I tried to use it. The only reason I puchased this was to edit recordings from the HDD to DVD. Although the HDD funtion is decent, I need an external recorder to tansfer to DVD. After 4 recorders I didn't even bother to send this one back for a refund. Stay away from this."
1,Disappointed,The DVD drive can't load any disc after two DVD recorded (90min/each).Return to Amazon for full refund.
2,Using Phillips DVDR3575H/37 with Dish Network,"It's an awesome recorder, except for one thing, and it's pretty big in my opinion. I have Dish Network and their remote can't control the DVDR. This makes this device inefficient to me, because it doesn't have a TV Guide, and I like to use Dish Networks on Air Guide, to punch in the many shows I like to record for the week, and not worry about it. Dish doesn't have a remote control code for this device, and Phillips tells me I'm out of luck. Does anyone know their way around this issue?"
2,Can't record in HD?,"According to the product manual:(page 39) All high definition pictures will be down converted tothe standard definition pictures when they are recorded on this unit.(page 42) This unit cannot record images as aspect ratio of 16:9. The 16:9 images will be recorded as 4:3.But, it really does seem to do a good job of recording and it seems to record in 16:9 for me. I recorded last week's Packers game to the hard drive. I also watched the game on my HDTV in real time straight off the air (bypassing the 3575 completely). The signal I got off the air was in HD and was beautiful. After the game was over I watched it again off the 3575's hard drive. The picture on the screen was in 16:9 filling the HDTV screen completely. The quality of the picture seemed almost as good as the live picture had been. So, I'm impressed. I'd actually rate the unit at 4 stars but I can't seem to make that change."
4,Simple and Versatile,"I've owned the Philips for about a month now and I'm very satisfied with it and its capabilities. I've been using a MediaCenter PC for several years and I like some of the features of the Philips that surpass the MC, namely the ease at which I can make titles from recorded material, omitting commercials easily and combining titles onto one DVD.One improvement for the Philips would be a built-in Program Guide; however, I use the MC to schedule programs, making it a double effort.The Remote Control is functional, especially the 30-second skip and the 5-second replay. Its layout could be improved and keys made larger for bigger hands.I like the many recording modes available; and even some of the extended modes (for longest number of hours) which are still acceptable for viewing and archiving.Overall, the Philips is a good machine that could be improved, but that has most of what one would want for a good price."
3,query,"I own a previous dvd player manufactured by Phillips. Just like that one, this recorder seems to be high quality. However,it is not particularly intuitive to use. I stll have not been able to figure out the editing procedures."
4,Good Value,"This unit offers good value for your money. It works exactly as advertised.It was easy to install, and after getting over the first few uses of all of its features, the set-up, play-back, and editing are pretty easy and straight forward to use. It would be nice if you could title a recording prior to recording. You have to access the title and enter your unique title after you have recorded the program. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase."
4,Great item! Better than Te Vo,"I bought this to replaqce my deceased low cost DVD recorder with a better unit. I thought I would like the hard drive feature and use is once in a while. I was wrong.The hard drive and self time feature is fantastic! I never miss a show I wanted to see. After watching the show I can copy it to DVD, or erase it. It took a little learning to maximize the use of it. My wife loves it and uses it every week to capture her craft shows!. You can even watch a show from the begining while it is half recorded.My only complaint is that in the hard drive fast mode the digital image is opf poor quality on my 42 sctreen. After changing to best quality for recording ist is much better. Recordings are not in HD, but neither is most of teh shows."
4,Philips DVD with 160G Hard Drive,Philips DVDR3575H/37 1080p Upscaling DVDR with Built-In TunerOnly had it a couple of weeks but it seems to work perfectly. I bought this item because it has a digital ATSC tuner and because the DVD recorders with hard drives are becoming more and more scarce. I receive all my local digital channels with an external antenna but can't seem to receive some 60 miles away. There analog versions are watchable but not digital. (May try a booster in the future). I love the ability to temporally record shows to watch later and can still decide if I want a DVD copy from the hard disk. Still using an analog TV for viewing but the picture is better than VCR recordings.
1,poor quality control,Having read everything I could find on this unit I drove 50 miles to pick one up (the local Wallmart did not have 'em). The one I got had poor tuning. Of the four Major Network local stations one was so snowy that it was useless. Of the four indipendent station it completely missed one and the other three were marginal. The remote has to be held within 2 feet of the of the unit for it to function and then it is hit or miss.From the various reviews that I have read it seems that this is consistent. If you get a good one great ... if you get a bad one them to bad. Phillips/Ploaraid evidently have abandoned all semblance of any kind of quality control program. Wallmart is the only national chain that carries this unit ... perhaps this is the reason.
5,I Like This Recorder,I purchased this DVD recorder to replace a three year old Sharp model that would no longer dub. I found the new Philips to set up and operate very easily. I found editing programs on the HDD to be very simple and the ability to label titles as easy as sending a text message on a cell phone. I think the price is right and I have no complaints so far with this product.
2,Bad Choice,This DVR has many great features however the hard drive freezes frequently during playback of recordings. It started within the first week of purchasing the unit. This is my first purchase of a hard drive so I don't have anything else to compare it to but so far it's been very frustrating.
4,Philips DVDR35h/37 Recorder,"The recorder was delivered on time and in perfect condition. The unit is great. The installation was easy and worked the first time. I really appreciate the fact that I don't have to enter 3 digits to change channels, i.e. 007 vs 7. The recorder has a digital tuner which is a plus and a 160g hard drive to record TV programs. The recorder will upscale standard DVDs, but you have to purchase a HDMI cable to take advantage of this feature. I would have rated the recorder a 5, but I havent tried to record anything yet and I have'nt installed the HDMI cable to my Panasonic plasma monitor (I broke my ankle and I'm crrently on crutches so my activities are limited). I expect to have this recorder fully functional this Fall and look forward to great viewing.Based on my limited usage(2 months), I believe this recorder is a great buy."
4,Best HDD DVD Recorder with Digital Tuner,Get many channels over the air (OTA). I think I don't need to purchase a Digital TV after analogue ceased broadcasting 2 years later.
2,Not for use in weaker TV reception areas,"The performance of the analog TV tuner in this product was dismal using an antenna: high noise and some of the channels both my VCR and TV could receive weren't stable or watchable. The performance was so bad that I ended up returning the recorder. If you are recording from an analog cable you may be OK, but if you are hoping to record from an antenna be careful. I didn't give the ATSC tuner a real test.Note also that although the recorder has an ATSC (HD) tuner, it downgrades the signal and only records it in SD (i.e. non high def) form.Also the upconverting of analog signals to 1080i is problematic - there are no options to select whether you want the signal zoomed or kept at its existing size. So if there are (say) subtitles near the bottom of the picture you may not be able to see them.Nice features: shame about the analog off-air picture."
1,"I like it and I am 60 years old,but still a kid",I recived the 1/10 not the 1/6 car but it leaves tire marks on my tile. I whish you had sent me the 1/6 and not the 1/10
1,car didn't work,I recieved the car and set it up according to the manufacturers instructions and it didn't work! I contacted the manufacturer and they mailed me a shipping return label and I returned it to them. I am awaiting a new or fixed car back from them.
4,JEFF GORDON REMOTE CAR,VERY FAST AND FUN TO DRIVE. I HAVE THE REGULAR MODEL AND THE HOBBY GRADE. STEERING WITH THE HOBBY GRADE MODEL MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE.
1,Not very clever,The book was not what I expected. I didn't find the book to be very clever or humorous. It was a disappointment.
5,"The month doesn't matter, October Road Rocks!","Gave this as a gift and my sister loved it. She was hooked on the show and upset that she came to the series after a few episodes had already aired. So, she got all caught up and is now a pretty happy camper.If you, or someone you love, loves the show, owning this is a win-win situation! If you or someone you love loves(ed) Dawson's Creek, Everwood, or any of the other WB shows they'll probably love this one too!"
3,LAST EPISODE MISSING,Although I like October Road I was disappointed the last episode with Abrey kissing the younger brother Ronnie was not included?
2,I've seen better,"Too predictable, too slow and the characters aren't as developped as they should be. The idea is good but it' missing a little depth."
4,October Road !st season,I really liked this so I ordered the 2nd season also. It's a shame it was cancelled so soon. I thought the story was interesting and the characters were believable.
2,October road,I think that there was real potential for this show but it just did not show through.The lead role I thought was good but I am biased as I am a tree hill fan!The storys could of done with a jump as there was just no get up and go no grip that made you want to come back and continue watching.Bit of a let down for me but if you are bored and a little desperate then do watch
1,0 Stars,"""Off the Hook"" is a shameless collection of some of the tackiest, most irritating urban radio hits. Sure, we get talented artists like Angie Stone, Aaliyah and Glen Lewis, but they get cancelled out by the appearances of Ja Rule & J.Lo, B2K, and Lil' Bow Wow. Buy something else, please."
3,Comedy from a TV program,"This video originally was produced as a segment for a TV show about comedians. It's funny in places, but the format of the TV show does break the comedic flow somewhat. Also, this video is a TV length program and not full performance videos, which are available under separate titles. The comedy is funny, but the three stars are for length and format."
5,Good clean wholesome fun!,"Two words to describe this man. Pure, funny! He is an amazing comedian and I could watch him over and over again! Completely clean, but just as funny as if he wasn't! (which is sad to have to have something dirty for it to be funnier)LOVED HIM!"
2,Out of date and lots of mistakes,"The book is now 10 years old, and includes question types that the GMAT doesn't use anymore. The book is also riddled with mistakes, though it might be cheaper than some of the other options, I don't think it's worth it."
1,Movie mess up,"The seller information had exceptionally high ratings, however, this item was listed as ""like new"". When I received the movie, not only did the case look like it has been either sat on or chewed on by an animal, but the movie flickered and had a static-like bar running through the middle of the picture throughout the entire movie. Would return but it was so inexpensive it's not worth my time."
4,Great,I found this film good because i like the singing that is involved in it and the plot is also kinda twisting at the end but u have to watch it to see what happens :)
1,The worst rendition I've seen,"I had to watch this while I was babysitting-don't waste your time on this lame excuse for a so-called ""movie"". How can you turn people into instruments(the only acception is Disney's Beauty and the Beast)? I suggest getting Fox's ""Anastasia"". The historical plot may be off-which it is-but it's better than this ""movie"". It doesn't even deserve a one, more like NEGATIVE one."
2,Consider buying a manual foot pedal type instead,"I have had this trash can for a few weeks now and it has not lived up expectations. The can itself is relatively flimsy and it does not have a hard plastic liner like the manual (foot pedal) flip-top trash cans do. It is difficult to get the trash bags to stay in place because the plastic ring that holds them will fall into the can. Also, if you place the can in an area where it is close to foot traffic, the lid will open and close when you walk by.The one plus is that you can place it against the wall and the lid will open fine. With most manual trash cans, the lid will not open all the way if the trash can is against the wall. However, I wish I had bought the Simpleman 40 Liter Semi-Round Manual Step Can instead."
3,its o.k.,"this is the second cd by GLU i have and i think i like ""My Life In the So-Called Space Age"" better. it just seemed weird to hear heavier guitar in the back ground. i think they're better at more mellow aspects of their music. still, if your a big fan of anything else you've heard by GLU then by all means pick this up for such a choice price."
1,Bad Bad Bad!,"Warning!!! You will not like this music if you like REAL industrial. This cd is nothing but whiny, electro-pop/rock. And its not good either! The vocals sound forced and cheesy. The music is lackluster and boring. Way better things in the genre, so skip this. Buy KMFDM's Xtort or 16 Volt's SuperCoolNothing instead, they came out around the same year and are waay better."
4,like it............,"If you like industrial bands, you must have this album. I fell in love with it. It doesn't pull you in right away, but listening to it a few times get's you hooked! Still, No More Love, 23, Weaken....excellent songs!"
5,One of the best,This might be the most overlooked album of all time. These guys absolutely were geniuses. Amzaing from begining to end. if you like this one check out their first self titled cd too. One of my all time favorites.
4,Great movie with a less-than-great ending,"In fact, ""This Girls Life"" seems to be two movies: first, it works over the relationships of internet pornstar Moon and the world around her - this part is truly great, with very well constructed characters (specially Moon herself and her ill father, played by James Woods) and cleverly avoiding making judgments about anything; the second, which comes up on the final third of the movie, is clearly weaker, more moralist and somehow desconstructing the characters so wonderfully built in the ifrst part."
2,Expect Skinemax not an insightful indie.,"I picked up this flick from the recomendation of an educated female friend of mine. We were discussing the fact that since pornography is purely exploitive by nature it is immune from exploitation and therefore might be the last ""pure"" art in America ( in very limited examples). She recomended this film for it's take on the subject. Suffice to say this movie doesn't do or say anything that others haven't. It's got the eye candy and James Woods channeling Michael J Fox (too soon?) but is ultimately disappointing in it's pacing, dialogue, and content. As I understand it this is Juliet Marquis's (a model from the Czech Republic I think) breakout role. She handles her part well; I personally could see her as the next Mila Jovovich B+ horror movie staple. In any case, if you're curious rent it then there's no shame in hitting stop early."
2,"Poorly Made, Average Music, Some Above Average Actors..",Here is a list of the music that was used for the film in order of its use:Picture Perfect - PollynLinctus - Aim - Hinterland LabelLebanese Blonde - Thievery Corporation - Mirror Conspiracy LabelChina Morning - Jussi Tegelman & Traci HendricksOceanwide - HalouRatio of Freckles to Stars - HalouRiverside - Nicholas DavidageHumming - Scott ThomasCome to California - Deborah FalconerClean Up - Funky Fresh FewSave Yourself - SirenBreakneck - Only ChildTrack 3- Ant MusicPolitical - HalouThe Dime Train - Mark RaeBanger - Funky Fresh FewInvestigation - Jussi TegelmanTrack 2 - Ant MusicFor Gloria - SirenAftermath - SirenQueen of the Sun - LuckyStimulation - Pollyn
4,Juliette Marquis should really be a big star.,"Juliette Marquis is a beautiful girl who can act and is very likeable. James Woods did a great job as her father. The movie is shot to look exactly like a straight to cable late night soft core movie but it's NOT. This is about how a pretty girl usually in a warm weather part of America believes wrongly that she's emancipated. This is a companion piece to Morena Baccarin's working girl's scenes in the TV series ""Firefly."""
1,worst movie ever,"i've seen better acting in actual porn, and real porn actually has porn, instead of this whatever it is. and the old man with parkinsons is depressing as shit, i dont wanna see that."
5,Not all pron is bad,"It was an interesting view that not all porn is bad and not all porn stars are druggies and abused kids. The premiss that porn in and of itself is not bad but the way its made and how the unhealthy enviornment of most porn is bad. If some how it could be made a more 'main stream' industry it could be a healthy(er) and cleaner way of making a living. The downside of the movie they leave it at that, no hard suggestions of how, hints of more female directors and producers, but just small hints of how. All in all a good movie, better then others I have seen similar to this one."
3,Marquis shines where drama slighly falters,Juliette Marquis pops off the screen in this movie (first seen on Showtime). James Woods chews scenery as her disabled father.
5,Promising New Author,This is a book that is filled with true-to-life situations and vividly-drawn characters. First-time novelist Mitchell gives us reason to look forward to future works.
4,"The terrorists that destroyed the Boer Republics, South Africa, 1899-1902.","The report fails to mention how the terrorists of Britain destroyed the Boer Republics. The reports focus too much on Muslims as terrorists. When the CIA and other definitions of terrorism are considered, it is realised that Britain exercised terrorism against the Boer civilians.In the book,British terrorism against Boer civiliansit is clearly described how Boer children, defenseless women, the sick, elderly and disabled Boers were terrorised - some to death - by Queen Victoria and Edward VII's forces, in order to destroy the Boer Republics.I find it interresting that the BBC can ignore terrorism by its own government."
2,A High School production,"I agree completely with Mr. Dacey's description of this video as being done on the cheap from stock NASA footage. In fact, it wouldn't even play on one of my DVD players, and the other had a little trouble reading it. The soundtrack was disappointing, and there were several minor factual errors in the narration. So although I agree with his description, I feel compelled to give it a lower rating.But I have to admit that I had not seen some of the launch footage, so it was worth something. I much prefer David Sington's ""In the Shadow of the Moon."""
3,purchase,"I thought this was the movie ""Apollo 11"" from the TV movie, not a documentary. I was a little disappointed but it is ok. I wanted the movie with Tom Hanks in it. I still kept it, because it is an okay movie to watch."
4,"Human voice , mature beauty and passion","In the late 60s ""Sunshine Superman"" was my great treasure. Then I had that thought, ""Is he passing out Christian Bibles to motels with B.D.?"" Older, mature, passionate, and still beautiful. Music is still something that can bring joy and strength, peace and tears at the same time. Buddhism and compassion ... Vietnam and World Trade Organisation ... Donovan's ""Sutras"" calls to my soul over the madness, with greater meaning."
5,THE HUMBLE MINISTREL RETURNS WITH A NICE ALBUM,"On his first release in a number of years Donovan the 'humble minstrel' returns with a solid offering Sutras. 14 loving works allgraced with that simplistic 'natural' charm that Donovan is known for will make this a CD a 'welcome home' affair by any fan.All these tunes were recorded over a two year period and the recording is as sparse as could be with producer Rick Rubinbringing Donovan perfectly into his own realm of beauty that he has always been associated with. Among the standout tunes, Ihighly recommend the beautiful ""Give It All Up,"" ""Please Don't Bend"" & ""Lady Of The Lamp"". Long time bassist DannyThompson is once again by his old mate's side adding that perfect bottom to the tunes as he did in the past. Not to missed."
5,"Donovan ""Sutras""","Beautiful melodies,slow, easly to sing along.I want to listen this album over and over again. Very romantic and peacefull.95% of all songs are sooo beautiful."
2,"A very, very dry listening experience","I was given this as a gift. The advance reviews made one a little leery about purchasing it for myself.It is a very different album than anything, ANYTHING he released before. It is a very austure and dry album, might be great to mediate by but is largely devoid of the warmth and charm that characterized his other work in general and his hits in particular. I miss the more pop qualities for his other records. I haven't played it often or in quite awhile.Don't buy it on spec! See if you can borrow it and play it few times before making a decision."
5,Real change from Windows,"I bought this notebook to discover the Mac World. It is very interesting for someone that always used Windows. Great performance, easy to use. Iam very glad with my purchase and I recomend it to other windows users."
1,Hard drive + battery DOA after just 13 months,"I USED to love Apple products, but I've soured on them after my experience with my MacBook. Have had to replace the battery twice and a week ago, the hard disk died. Bad hard disks seem to be rampant with these computers - Google up ""macbook hard disk failure"" and you'll find a feast of complaints about MacBook hard disks borking out. To its credit, Apple replaced my battery and hard disk without a fee even though my MacBook had just passed out of warranty.Although I feel that Apple dealt honorably with the hard drive/battery issues, I don't recommend buying a MacBook until Apple fixes the problems endemic to these computers."
5,Just got it and am already in love!,"The UPS Guy just delivered my wonderful Macbook about an hour ago. The box was suprisingly light and I tore it open once I got inside. The box was white and everything was clean and neatly packed.I gently opened the laptop using the magnetic latch (nothing to fall off----LOVE IT!) and hooked it up. Set up was a breeze and I was wireless and checking my e-mail in no time. After I got over all the features and the ease of set up, a little box popped up on my screen telling me new software was availble to download. I glanced over it and it contained; Quicktime, iPhoto Update, Front Row Update, iTunes, an AirPort update, and Mac OS X Update. I was so suprised that it did id all by itself and I lve it!Here I am now, and I'll update this review in a week or so!"
3,with reservations,"the macbook is, like all apple products, simple to use and beautifully designed. but like all apple products, something has to suck. the last time i bought an apple computer half the lettering on the keys rubbed off. for the new macbook, the battery doesn't hold a charge. i don't like leaving the computer plugged in when i'm not using it, so i unplug the power after shutting down. not for long--maybe 8 hours. in that time, i lose one or two percent of the battery charge. when i replug the power while i'm working, the battery never seems to recharge past the percentage it was at when i turned it on.plus now that apple is using intel chips, the computer runs hotter than before. be prepared to hear the fan turn on unless you're working in a very cool room. i don't know about most people, but i hate hearing my computer make unfamiliar noises."
5,Finally switched!,"Bought this little gem from Amazon. As usual, great price and super service! Tired of dealing with issues involving non Macs, No more waiting for start up. Boots from cold in less than 20 seconds everytime. Black case does show fingerprints, etc;. Cleans easily, so no biggie. Software issues are non existent for me. Not heavy. Not too hot. Not noisy. Not going back to non-Macs! Also saved major bucks over local Apple store! Thanks Amazon!"
5,WAY better than PC,"I just switched from a PC to a mac and there IS a huge difference. Macs are just all around more people friendly and easier to use. They also do not get really slow because macs don't get spyware or viruses. It also comes with more useful programs.In conclusion, MAC RULES, PC DROOLS!!!"
5,amazing,"I had a compaq which broke and then i decided to splurge on something really nice. I have no complaints so far and this is the first mac ive ever owned. I found the transition extremely easy. Everything on the mac is easier and faster, simply amazing."
1,item arrived broken,"The machine arrived in non-working condition: turns out the logic board needed to be replaced. Rather than return to Amazon, I merely brought it to a local Apple store since I was likely to get it back sooner than arrange for pickup and redelivery with Amazon and obviously it was covered under warranty since it was non-functional out of the box. This isn't a criticism of the machine which works well, but it was frustrating to receive a new machine that was broken."
2,Returned Unopened !,"I returned this Macbook because I realized that with me runnig WinXP withParallels, the harddrive & ram would not be large enough for my needs."
4,Great laptop - not coffee-proof!,"Unfortunately the laptop is in the shop already after having a cup of coffee dumped on it... but it was running great while we had it :) Really powerful processor, everything ran very cleanly and quickly. Bought the upgrade because the old laptop was so slow when trying to integrate multiple graphics into other documents and didn't like to run too many programs at once. With the new MacBook we can have everything open and running, be juggling multiple images in photoshop, formating in Word, switching back and forth, moving .tif images here and there, and it all works smoothly with no lag."
5,I Love MacBooks!,"My school uses MacBooks to do projects, write essays, make spreadsheets, and make movies and buy music. Macs are great! They are super-fast, super-easy, and they look great. They also have two hardwares that PC doesn't have: a built-in camera and a built-in microphone. How awesome is that? iLife is the best software tool ever. It can create movies, CD's, songs, websites, and so much more! Of all the Macs I've used at my school, not a single one crashed-ever! It's too bad I wrote this on PC. MacBooks are the best computers anyone will ever use. They certainly were for me!"
3,"Nice design, nice software, delicate hardware","I bought a Macbook in June 2007. It has a nice design, sleek, very nice software. But the hardware is delicate.The hard drive failed completely 1 week after the 1 year warranty. I did not bother to try to convinceApple to pay for the repair (I was not in United States) and had it repaired at my own expense. Thehard drive failed again just recently. Total lost of data. (I also owned an iMac, the hard drivealso failed after 2.5 years.) I am very careful with these computers but they appear tohave weak hard drives. It is not only cost, but the inconvenience of losing documents and tryto recover them that is painful. If you buy a Mac, backup your precious documents on a reliableexternal drive. Better yet, buy an external drive and use exclusively with the new Time Machine software to have automaticbackups. I found out the hard way that it is a must with this computer."
5,Great system!,"I finally made the ""switch"" and I'm wondering why I ever bothered with a PC. I haven't had any problems with this macbook and I've had it for about a half year so far. I have the 1 gig of memory which has worked fine. I can only imagine how it will work with the 2 gig upgrade I'm about to do. You pay a little bit of a premium for macs but it's worth it as you get what you pay for. The only thing that i have to complain about is that itunes will freeze up on me if a cd is scratched while trying to burn it. No biggie though. That's about it. I've done a whole lot of video and music work and it's worked seamlessly. Highly Recommended."
1,Possible design flaw ??,"We bought a MacBook this spring and liked it so much we bought a 2nd for my son's HS graduation 2 months ago. Both perform flawlessly. However after only 2 months of NORMAL use the LCD screen on my son's Mac has cracked. Apple quoted a base cost of $750 to replace--more than 2/3rds of the original cost! (Actually, they said ""Don't fix; buy a new unit."") I was quick to blame my son for misuse, but now I'm uncertain if that is fair. I have found many blogs reporting the same fragile LCD cracks on MacBooks, many which seemed to occur spontaniously. Apple, of course, claims misuse and will not warranty. Even the additional Apple Care warranty excludes LCD replacement. Perhaps the cover design inadequately protects the screen. Think twice. Or at least buy a hard snap on case which may provide some protection."
4,Neat laptop!,"Although the conversion from being a Windows PC user to an Apple MacBook user is a bit difficult, all the information I needed was available. The keyboard is the most comfortable of all the laptops I've used, although I did buy a wireless mouse which is a big help when going from a PC to a laptop. Shipping was fast and free, another big benefit of shopping with Amazon."
4,Sleek and colorful,"Just received this item and popped it onto my macbook easily. It came off easily as well with no scratches (I was careful). It also helps with the edge of the computer being so sharp against my wrists - so that is a definite bonus. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I seemed to think the plastic would be thicker. It doesn't seem very sturdy until you put it onto the computer--but still I think it could be sturdier. Overall, I am happy with it and I love the way it accents my computer while protecting the case from damage."
3,Not to shabby,"Well sorry mix-a-lot but theres only a couple of good songs""Man u luv 2 hate"" and #9,7,1,.... Need better sounds good rap though."
2,"Oh, how the Big Boss has fallen...","Mix-A-Lot, we hardly knew ye. ""Return of the Bumpasaurus"" has some great sounds, yes, but his style is moving away from the old school sound that made his other albums so much fun. The reason I like Mix above all other rappers, that being his sense of humor, refusal to take himself too seriously, and great voice -- with one or two exceptions it's all gone here. He lets his little friends have too much time in front of the mike; in fact, despite the ""Sir Mix-A-Lot"" name on the front, we don't hear as much of him as we deserve. His hangers on have no talent, and his back beats are starting to take that washed-out quasi-gangsta sound. Do yourself a favor -- get the ""Jump on It"" single and listen to ""Mack Daddy"" again."
2,an average record under hip hop standards (which is bad),"I certainly wouldn't go as far as to say that this album is complete garbage; after all, Sir Mix-a-lot is a talented rapper and manages to maintain his image as a uniquely real artist. I'd say that the biggest problem with this album is that the beats are sort of boring...defintely not the type of stuff you can play at a club or whtaever. His lyrics are good, but not as good as his previous records. My personal favorite song is 'Mob Style', it's really the only one that I can enjoy listening to more than once. In the end, I was largely disappointed."
1,Early failure on compressor,"My unit is a couple of years old now. I probably have a total run time on of less that 5 hours as it was only ever used for blowing up tires and water toys. The compressor now fails to build pressure beyond 40 pounds. Thought I would fix it on my own and further research has discovered an amazing number of people with exactly the same problem. Quality of the compressor is horrible, lots of plastic parts and small springs in the pressure switch.When new it build pressure very slowly.I bought this exact combination which seemed like a good price with the nailers/staplers but the compressor is junk. Do a search on ""CAP60P-OF pressure"" to see all the negative issues. Bostitch changed the model number a few times but it's the same design.Better off spending your money on a high-end compressor."
4,Get this at lowes,"This combo pack is $275 at lowes and if you have a problem, you can take care of it locally!"
5,Great Product & Service,"Everything arrived A-OK. I LOVE THIS SYSTEM. I'm only sorry I didn't buy it sooner. Easy to use, durable & dependable."
5,SUPER EQUIPMENT!,"First off the items arived almost a week ahead of promised delivery. At first I thought they had made a mistake as these tools are brand new. I started using them right away, putting molding around new hardwood floors I installed and they worked fantastic. I will order from these people again. GREAT TOOLS!!!!"
4,"Bostitch CPACK3 Finish Nailer, Brad Nailer, Finish Stapler & Compressor combo Kit","Oringinally ordered this for Christmas and when open Christmas morning there were a couple of items missing. I emailed Amaazon about issue and they resent item ""express"", (this weighs about 30-40 lbs) and with return instructions. Very easy to deal with. The Bostich has performed flawlessly ever since we started useing it. Would highly recommend."
5,jake's review,"haven't used it hot and heavy like i want to, but it worked great in my practice trials. the nailers worked as well as can be expected, even from brand new. the compressor has worked as expected also."
2,Worked really good for a week...,"I bought this item to remodel my house. First compressor I've ever bought. I read the coments at Amazon and found it a good product. It came fast, worked great for about one week and them died. Just refused to turn on."
5,Air Nailer,Excellent says it all! Recieved in perfect condition.Unbeatable price. Highly recommended purchase!
2,eh...,Boilerplate rhetoric about how the US is the global policeman and no longer a republic but an empire. We've heard it all before...yawn...And I even agree!
2,Uniformed ... theory,"Vidal certainly has a much more impressive writing style than most polmerists, but it can't save this collection of uniformed ... theory essays. Always questioning goverment is a good position, but accusatory prose needs plausability and evidence. I'm Awaiting Mailer's effort."
1,Embarrassing,"Did Pierre Salinger ghost write this or what? I didn't vote for W, but this book overreaches with its ""junta"" angle. It's the kind of haughty, contemptuous, overheated screed that may be amusing at A-list dinner parties, but doesn't really merit serious consideration. Frankly, it is irresponsible, and an embarrassment to those of us in principled opposition to the administration's policies..."
1,Opps. . .what happened,"I've read most of Vidal's books and have been enlightened and educated. What happened with this one? The bias Gore chooses to poison this books pages with, make it only deserving of the garbage can. . .and there it went.Sorry Gore, but this one's not for me."
5,Vidal and Chomsky one of a kind,"Read Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace and Gore Vidals latest Dreaming War should be discussed by every journalist and told to the American Public, but of course it will not as the dumbing down of the citizenry is necessary in order for the Bush-Cheney Hitlerism to succeed. Why the investigation into 9-11 was curtailed was really because our government does not want the citizens to know how they are being duped into a Nationalistic flag waving aura.George W Bush and Dick Cheney should be impeached immediately.By the way, Gore Vidal could not have made this up in case any neo-consevatives are listening because like Chomsky, Vidal gives the facts/information and where it came from."
4,Blood For Oil,"This book was written by Gore Vidal, whose place was secured as a prolific preacher against America's imperialist policies before the events of September 11 .What I liked about this book is the frankly and courageous words that Vidal has written it ,and the description about the American's administration's plans ,and how they use the ""Terrorism"" word to find a justification to invade other countries ,and exploit their vital resources. And that's really what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq ,and nobody knows which country is the next . In my opinion I think this book is worth to read if you interested in politics ."

5,Beautiful pictures and touching stories,"This book makes a great gift. It is a very nice looking book at a good price. The pictures are as touching as the stories. If you love dogs or just want to read stories about love and courage this is a ""must have"" book."
3,"Still the best, but limited","This book is definitely the definitive book on the Russian Far East, but as time goes on, the information becomes more and more dated. As is the case all over Russia, places, names, and businesses change constantly throughout the Russian Far East and this book, as good as it is, shows its age with its many discrepancies.While I would still classify this book as a must read for any would-be traveler in the Russian Far East, I would also hope that a new revision or a replacement could be found in the near future."
4,A wide-ranging exploration of systems theory and creativity,"This book is itself a creative exploration of systems theory applied to cultural evolution. The connections this books make will make people think deeper about the assumptions that guide our daily affairs. A must read for anyone serious about systems theory, creativity, postmodernism, and feminism."
5,Awesome photos & wondeful muticultrual text,"This is a truly unique and fascinating coffee table book. Photographs as well as poems, scriptures, stories, myths, & legends are taken from all over the world & encompass many different cultures.The pictures are spectacular. They will take you to the misty mountains of China & then let you travel to the lush green forests of Italy. You will also witness the golden sun melting softly into the beautiful Australian coast.You can then observe zebras grazing the Serengeti Plain or discover the beautiful nature-made sandstone sculptures of Arizona. The brilliant green plains & sparkling blue waters of Madagascar will take your breath away.Captions for each these images are located in the back & include photographic information, location, & some of the photographer's thoughts on the composition. If you can only buy one coffee table book, this is definitely the one to get."
3,Fantastic,"Fantastic photography.. simpley A+...The books is just beautifull... The pictures are breathtaking, and the poems and writings are phenomenalSorry, but I had to give it 3 stars because amazon sold me this book, and there were 5 pages missing... I just couldn't believe it...However, the book is 5 stars +"
4,Simple but moving,"Lois Henderson's son, David, was born blind. Another Way of Seeing is the story of how long it took her to find this out, how she and her husband adjusted to the shock, and how they helped Davey grow to be everything he could be.This is a true story and a wonderful book. However, it is written from a naive point of view (as Lois herself admits in the new preface), so I felt it lacked some of the insights that might be helpful to others undergoing the same experience. Still, it is a beautiful story."
2,The red sandal,"I made a poor choice in buying this sandal, they are too slippery when on, the inside and the bottom of the sandal, no support what so ever. The only good thing about this sandal is the color GREAT color"
4,A great all-around summer shoe,"This shoe was an excellent addition to my spring/summer wardrobe! I usually wear a size 8 in boots and winter shoes, but I can usually get away with a 7 1/2 for my sandals so that's what I ordered and they fit perfectly. These shoes do need a little breaking in time however. I would recommend wearing them around the house for a bit. The thingy between the toes takes some getting used to, but it did not bother at all after awhile. These shows look great with dresses and jeans :)"
4,pretty,"I liked the style and in gold, it is very attractive. It fits tighter than I like but think it will stretch."
4,"Good, Pretty and Cheap","These shoes really look very good but there are two things I want to mention. In terms of size is half a point smallest, finally they sent me a diferent size.Thanks to this mistake is that I learned that size is small."
2,Not what I expected,After reading other reviews I ordered a 1/2 size to big and they are still uncomfortably tight. I can't wear them even around the house without them bothering me. Money down the drain.
3,Not as comfy as I expected,"When I received them, thought that I will be wearing them whole summer and enjoy the comfort. But the very first time I wore these, the straps rubbed sore, and so badly that I have to nerve myself to wear them again.However, they look really nice and I think that in a couple of times they will fit my feet pretty good."
1,Square Sandal,"Very square shaped shoe, but the gold was a pretty color. Also, ordered size 8, actually 7.5 or 7.The strap is not adjustable. It's just a little elastic."
3,Not what I expected,"I really did not care for the way these sandals looked on me, and ended up returning them. Furthermore, I thought I was getting black leather, but got patent leather which I did not want."
4,Cute AND Comfy :-),The sole is heavily padded making this thong sandal comfortable to wear all day long. VERY good quality at an excellent price. I will buy this brand again.
5,Slip on and go!!,Very comfortable and easy to slip on when you're in a hurry! Great choice and wish it came it different colors!!
1,MIA women's Island Thong,They are not comfortable and you can't adjust them to fit right either.Because they are cheap so I don't want to waste my time to return them.
3,Takes a while to break in,"These sandals are great...once they're broken in. At first, the straps around the toes were too tight to wear for more than an hour comfortably, and I would get massive blisters/cuts on my toes. However, I stuck it out and now they are super comfortable. I would suggest bending the entire shoe (just exaggerate how it bends when you walk) to help them break in. I'm not sure that I would buy another pair because of this problem, but since I only paid $15 for them I'm not too upset but wouldn't pay more than that."
2,DON'T BE FOOLED,"The powers to be at this label, BMG, are trying to take your money, by fooling you again, into thinking that this is a ""new"" STYX cd. Just like they did before,on EXTENED VERSIONS, BMG has lied about this cd, saying recorded live. Some songs are, but they are taken form the STYX/REO live cd ARCH ALLIES, released a year earlier. Rest of the songs are studio versions, that all ready appear on RETURN TO PARADISE, and BRAVE NEW WORLD. So if already own these three cds, you are simply adding to you collection as a STYX fan, or wasting your money, thinking your getting something different.But as far as the songs go, Glenn's Edge of the Century and Dennis' The Grand Illusion, as song by Lawarence, are the only non Tommy songs. JY has no songs on this cd. Hopefully, Tommy will remember that STYX is a group effort, not just one person, after all, wasn't that what he and Dennis were into it about?"
4,Not Bad,"OK, I do admit, I wouldn't actually buy this album for myself, since I have the three that structure it, but it's not that bad. Like any other compilation in the world, this is not built up for the big time fan. Think about it, would you give a Led Zeppelin box set a bad rating because you have half of it on vinyl? No, this is an album more fore somebody who's heard Styx, or doesn't have ""Return to Paradise"", ""Brave New World"", or ""Arch Allies"" anyway. Jeez, people need to lighten up."
1,Why Gay Men are Poisoning Today's Women,"Gay men have it all wrong. They think that straight men are just plain evil, this book tells it as THEY see it. Not all straight men think Tiramisu is a Japanesse restaurant, in fact it is my favorite dessert. This book thinks that straight men are sexist pigs, when in fact gay men are just as sexist when they look at other men. Ladies beware, because when you finally meet the right man (and you will), your Best Gay Friend just might try and take him from you."
5,Really Good,"This book does a good job of recreating life, the hardships, deprivations and overall changes required of society on the American homefront during the years of the Second World War. It also shows the lives lived by Red Cross Volunteers, troops as they were transported overseas, nurses, WAV's and WAC's, factory laborers and children. It uses great illustrations and descriptions to personalize the age and show what our forebears endured. I especially liked the effort invested by the author(s) in pointing out how virtually everyone contributed something toward winning the war. This book leaves few stones unturned and I think a brilliant job is done in demonstrating a 360-degree view of what life during this time of struggle was like for millions of Americans."
5,Classroom Helper,"This is a great book to use in the classroom while teaching children about WWII. The children learned much more from this book than their text book. It shows how children and adults lived during the war. There is a lot of useful information to get the childrens attention for future lessons. I recommend that all children read this book if they are studying WWII. It's not really a story just a lot of information about clothes, toys, sports, food, etc....It is by far the best resource I have found."
5,Parodies a plenty,"Gintama is always hilarious, but some of the Gundamn jokes I still don't get having never seen that show. Gintama is one of the best parody show out there.. ranging from older titles like Lupin the third to Case closed to Yakitate Japan lol. If you don't mind spastic humor and ongoing jokes you will love Gintama."
2,Not worth the price,"I bought this for the full $15 price, but even at $10, it's not worth it. It just gives you various song/rhymes to sing to your kids, a few little games, but nothing new or truly original."
1,Not Impressed,Very redundant...any normal parent would already do these things. Not worth the money. =(
4,Many Good Thoughts,"I had Coleman McCarthy as a professor while an undergrad at the Catholic University of America. This book is a good focus of the lessons he taught in class about non-violence and the need to find peaceful resolutions to conflict. While a I might not agree with some of his words, one is unable to deny that the content sparks thoughts on issues regarding the death penalty, abortion, animal rights, the use of weapons and war. This a great book for teachers who are trying to find more contemporary ways to teach about non-violence."
1,Never had a class with the Professor,"I had to give it one star. There is nothing more honorable than to work for an organization that helps others such as USAID, Peace Corps etc. but what of the Dept of Defense? I have had a chance to work for all three and it seems like the author is taking his reverance for peace from the first ""Billy Jack"" movie. Then again I guess if there are zealots that can become the genesis of war, I am sure there are milksops that can do the same for peace."
1,Are there more than Four songs on this?!,"This is not a review, but a comment on the listing, and not the product....How can anyone buy, much less review, this cd without even knowing which Songs are on it?!! I am assuming that it contains more than the Four listed on the front!Jeesh!"
2,Notebook case,"I bought this for my 15 in. notebook, it's doesn't fit. The dimensions were correct but when I tried to zip the case, I couldn't do it. It would have been perfect otherwise."
2,Won't fit a 15 inch laptop!!!,This case is too small to fit a 15.4 inch Macbook Pro which is smaller than most other 15.4 inch laptops! Fits into the case but will not zip up. It sticks out of the top of the case about a half inch. Do not buy this if you have a 15 inch computer!!!
2,Didn't care for it.,"This album wasn't what I expected. Only one song I recognized, and the rest were OK, but no great find. Unfortunately, I ordered 4 albums at the same time....should have ordered one, and then I would have known to skip the rest."
4,Good Reference,I've been wanting to make a braided throw rug for a long time and got this book to learn exactly how. I've had success with my project so far and in part I think it's because of the pointers you can pick up from reading this book. It's got good illustrations and clear instructions and is a real saver of time and effort. I'd recommend it.
2,Very limited offering,"Hooking, prodding, poking, clipping is the description for 14 of the 15 projects. There is little variation in the projects, only a variety of patterns of the same type. There is only one braided rug featured and it is basically 6 braids lined up and sewn together in straight lines. From the description and cover, I expected more of a range of rag rugs. If you want a comprehensive book, keep looking. I am."
4,Making Rag Rugs,"The book is easy to follow. I didn't realize that many of the rugs were hook rugs, or made with a burlap backing. I bit too hard on my hands."
4,Wrong expectations,"I was looking for more information on making braided rugs. No fault of the book. I didn't look at the table of contents closely enough before I purchased it. Delivery time, condition were excellent."
4,making rag rugs,Book is beautifully illustrated and instructions are quite easy to understand. Nice to have a resources page in which to order supplies. Can't wait to have the time to try my hand at one of the lovely rugs!
3,Not what I was looking for,"Very nice book, but not what I was looking for. I was looking for a different type of ""rage rug"" instructions. I kept the book to give as a gift."
4,Relief in my day......,"I have tried sooooooo many different kinds of supplements for my sons ADHD and am pretty seriously trying to avoid medication. He has a very aggressive type and is prone to outbursts and meltdowns and this supplement has helped to calm them Wayyyyyyy down. It does not take away the struggle, does not cure him, but it makes him so much better off through the day. He is doing well in school and so most of his struggle comes at home with me, he is still very active, pestering his siblings any chance he gets, but he is so much happier and more aggreable the rest of the time because he is dealing with the over-stimulation of ADHD so much better. I think it may or may not work depending on the kids--but isn't it always worth the try when your options are chemical-based cover-ups?"
3,The product was not for me.,It has worked some what but it is not the wonder product that was in all of the web sites that we read about it.
1,plastic junk,This item didn't look particularly nice nor did it do a good job of refracting light. I even put a powerful light right up against it and still it didn't do a good job of refracting. Don't buy this.
5,how can you not like this album?!?!?!,"To those with the negative reviews.....what the hell do you listen to?This is hands down a down south classic. I first heard of Boo by way of Concentration Camp and on the Lone Star Ridaz Compilations, and his flow is too throwed and with Happy P on the production, GAME OVER. If you find this for a decent price pick it up, you won't be let down."
1,straight up garbage,man I begged and pleaded with the store managers at sam goody to please give my money back that I spent buying this cd. I even told them that I would take an exchange-a n'sync cd or something! anything just to make me feel like I shouldn't have wasted that dub. I bought this garbage after I read the reviews and now I made sure I came back and let the folks know the real on this garbage.
3,Low Budget Gem!,"I have to admit that I am a little biased toward this movie because it was shot in and around my hometown. Brent Florence delivers with his first feature film, filling the roles of writer, director and actor with surprising prowess.Despite it's very low budget, this movie is highly entertaining while providing a refreshing social commentary about power, control, hope, courage and responsibility.The characters are well developed and work together seamlessly"
5,My Favorite Independant Adventure,"I am in this film. My name is Christian Leffler, I play Neil(NIHIL). Brent Florence, the writer/director of this film, originally titled SOLID ONES, understands storytelling, casting, and actors so well that the film works on multiple levels. For young filmakers it's a testament to the independent process. Shot on Hi-definition video and then processed to look like film it is a stepping stone in independant film making. Florence and his crew were brave in their journey and it shows through the film. The comentary is going to enlighten you to the fun we had and the technical follies as well. It's a fun ride for, literally everyone, that I hope you will enjoy and share with your friends. Keep your mind open and keep supporting smaller films as these films will challenge you, taking risks the studios ar too afraid to take."
5,A MUST BUY ALBUM FOR ANY SERIOUS COLLECTOR,NOW THIS IS WHAT I CALL GOOD MUSIC! I CAN PLAY THIS ALBUM OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND STILL ENJOY IT...I CAN'T WAIT TO GET SOME OF HIS OTHER ALBUMS!!
2,Mitchum and Russell Trapped in Dull Melodrama,"The second pairing of Robert Mitchum and Jane Russell gets squandered in this RKO potboiler - a disappointing follow-up to ""His Kind of Woman."" Unfortunately, ""Macao"" (1952) generates little interest except for the potent Mitchum-Russell chemistry and the stylistic flourishes of director Josef von Sternberg (his last Hollywood film). An uncredited assist by Nicholas Ray could not salvage the routine effort."
4,PLEASING POPCORN PICTURE,"""Macao"" is the film noir for those who think all film noir is gloomy and deprerssing. Yes, Mitchum sleepwalks through his ""Bob, Son of Bogie"" role as an American adventurer kicking around the mysterious Orient. Jane Russell gets to look fetching and sing a few songs but this one is basically a light workout for all concerned. Lacking the comedic flair of its predecessor ""His Kind of Woman!"", ""Macao"" sort of works as a not-terribly-serious manhunt drama. I suppose the fun for hardcore cineastes is trying to figure out where Josef von Sternberg's work leaves off and Nicholas Ray's patch-up job begins. Strangely enough, it all works just fine and what might have been a mess becomes a commendable '50s adventure/thriller that happens to reside ""in the vicinity of"" film noir."
5,great gloves,"I use these when I am canning, it makes esae of tightening lids and getting jars out of the hot waterI also use them in the garden pulling weeds, the little stickers on the thistle can't get through the gloves, plus I have a better grip on the little buggers, no sliced fingers either."
2,Not suitable for kitchen use,"First of all, I ordered this product because I thought they are medium sized, The profile or product description did not specify the size and this is XL!I would recommend this product just for cleaning because they are so thick and would really protect when using harsh chemicals. I would not recommend for washing dishes, it is hard to bend your fingers. It will be a challenge to handle delicate glass wares.I called amazon.com and was given a refund with free shipping for returns."
3,Good but don't fit my hands,These gloves are thick and provide good protection.The extra large size does not fit my hand well.I have long thin fingers and these gloves are better designed for someone with wide but not very long fingers/thumb.
5,Rubber gloves,Bought these gloves to help clean up after Hurricane Sandy. They kept my hands safe from the unsanitary debris. They are thick rubber and lined which helped keep my hands dry.
2,"This is not the Alan Bates version of ""The Fixer."" Beware!","This is not the best version of ""The Fixer."" The Alan Bates/Dirk Bogarde version is the best--when will they put the superior version on DVD? I saw the original movie version of the Bernard Malamud novel during the sixties. I have it on VHS. The great Alan Bates and Dirk Bogarde were excellent, and the entire cast was also great, e.g., Ian Holm, David Warner, etc.Please put the original ""The Fixer"" on DVD! Also, get David Warner and Ian Holm to do commentary."
5,St. Raven is a winner,"Jo Beverly is absolutely wonderful with sensual Regency romances. I enjoyed this book tremendously. Except anthologies, I've probably read everything Jo Beverley has ever written.St. Raven is a great read - I ate it right up and passed it along to my mom as soon as I could; she's a fan, too.The resolution of the story of Le Corbeau was satisfying and the romance was great."
1,The only thing good about this book is the cover!,This is the dumbest book I've ever read. It's about a maidenly miss who is trying to restore the family's wealth by recovering jewels her father lost gambling. (familiar enough plot). But the jewels are hidden in a sexually explicit statue at the home of sexually depraved man. So the hero (who spend the whole book complaining about the fact that he is a duke and has too much work to do because of it) takes her to an orgy to recover the statue! PULEEZE..........The only entertaining part of the book was the first chapter when the duke plays a highwayman but it's definitely a short lived part of the book. No more Jo Beverley books for this reader.
2,This one went downhill fast!,"This is not one of Jo Beverley's best efforts. Very disappointing in fact. The first couple of chapters went well. The characters seemed multi-dimentional and then everyone starts behaving in unbelievable and illogical ways.St. Raven seemed interesting, a bit intriguing and even sexy. Cressida seemed a mindless twit to me. She suffered from the common Regency writer's problem of focusing on the fact that the hero is a rake. That gets so annoying and tedious that I begin to scan looking for story development. There was nothing about these two to keep me engaged in their lives. In all honestly I quit reading after about page 80."
2,Not entertaining,"I have to disagree with what seems to be the general feeling - I didn't like this book! The plot was terrible. Cressida's father loses everything to an evil man in a card game - including some erotic statues. One of these statues has gems in it that would save the family from ruin. So Cressida sets out to get the statue by agreeing to be the man's mistress but a highwayman kidnaps her and ends that plan.The highwayman is actually Tris, our hero, playing at larceny. From there, nothing happens as the pair try to get the statue back.Ms. Beverley tried to make it a very sensual book with the couple dressing up in silk and attending an orgy. But it just didn't seem to work in this case. ""I want...I want to be closer to you, Tris, than I've ever been to anyone since I slid messily from my mother's womb."" To me, things like that kill the mood.I still enjoy Jo Beverley's books, just not this one in particular."
2,It had a great begining...,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. It is my guess that this is the finale of the Rogue Series. I did not really enjoy the Rogue series because it would have been impossible for Nicholas to spend as much time as he did away from his new wife and child and be the father that all of the rogues seem to have needed. All at the age of 25. I was happy that he did not make even the slightest appearance in this story but the story was still bad. It was great until the end of the orgy, and then it just got boring. She became what I hate most about the heroine in a romance novel - a stupid female- I put this book down several times but I made myself finish it because I had hoped the last few chapters would save the book. They did not. They just made me angrier because I kept reading. I highly recommend the Maloren Series if you are a true fan of Jo Beverly."
5,Excellent Learning Tool,Excellent sequel to Pimsleur Hebrew I. Logical introduction of new information and periodic repeats of previously learned information. I strongly recommend the Pimsleur system in learning any new language.
2,Much harder that level one,"Level one was a challange but I was able to get threw it in about a year in my spare time. level two starts out much much more difficult with alot of new words in each new lesson, moves much quicker"
5,"Cool, Clear Water","SING DOWN THE MOON is a lovely synthesis of music and storytelling, a piece that excites the imagination and stirs the soul. These richly textured southern tales are told with great good humor and lyric beauty. The music is pure, true, and sometimes heartbreaking. I first heard some of these stories at the feet of my Grandaddy, and listening to this work reminds me of those evenings. Its just the way my Grandaddy would have told 'em . . . if he'd been a poet, and a composer, and if he'd had a few terrific actors and a genuine old-time band in his living room.SING DOWN THE MOON is something rare and true, my friends - a long, cool drink of springwater. You may not know you're thirsty for it, but you'll recognize the empty spot it fills once you commence to drinkin'."
3,"In its day, late 50's, acceptable","You had basically to choose from Giesekings wonderful 50's set, poor record quality, or this Casadesus. I found Casadesus did not live up to all the reviews surrounding his name, either in Debussy or Ravel.Look at my reviews of Ravel's magnificent solo piano works, the finestest ever penned in traditional classical form (I prefer Ravel much much more over Chopin) pianists such as Rouvier/Calliope, Bavouzet/MDG, Roge/Decca, Tharaud/Harmoni Mundi. These 4 alone will convince you that Ravel indeed did penned the greatest writing as far as classical traditional form.""How preposterious the thought!""Well you do not own any of the above mentioned cds. You will have a revelation when you do hear those 4.Nice DayPaul, eternal fan of RavelBaton Rouge"
5,summary,"item was a very great suspence movie, it challenges you mind and the excietment keeps on the edge of the seat. the family gave it a thumbs. recomend this one to all mystery fans."
3,Not Bad,Mobile was OK. There were enough twists in the plot to keep us watching to the end. It's definitely better than most US-made films of this type. We'll watch this again.
2,Graphic violence & nudity,"I only watched the first five minutes before I turned this off. The violence was pretty graphic and there was a nude sex scene right at the beginning of the film (male rear visible). I suspect this would easily qualify for ""R"" rating if it was rated."
1,Oh my,You enjoyed 'Foyle's War' and now you see Michael Kitchen on the cover? Don't make my mistake - I bought the DVD an I tried to watch it - I really tried.
1,Horrible customer service,"I've had this computer for about a year now and 6 months into having it, I've had nothing but problems. HP has poor customer service and the people don't know what they are talking about. I brought it to my computer care center at school when HP told me that my hard drive had crashed and been erased and said I had nothing left on the computer and they would have to rebuild it. The computer center showed me, that by pulling out a bad stick of RAM that all my files and programs were still on my computer and nothing had been erased, I had a bad stick of RAM. However, the customer service people insisted that I was going to have to rebuild my whole computer. Maybe they should learn some more about the things they are handling...I also have a printer by HP that refuses to work on a regular basis. Just bad products overall...save yourself and don't buy an HP."
4,bible for motorhome owners,I read the book cover to cover and learned just how the engine works and how it can be imporved for little money. An absolute bible!
3,A Woman of Aran,"""A Woman of Aran"" is a quick but worthwhile summer read. Covering the life of a simple irish woman(BridgetDirrane), who during her long life has crossed paths with some of the most prominent names in modern irish history. Her observations cover over 100 years and give the reader a feeling for some of the changes that have taken place in a rather remote part of Ireland. This story is written in the simple language of an uncomplicated woman as if she were talking to a friend or neighbor. By reading this book, I was able to learn a few thing about an area of Ireland that might not normally be written about."
5,Aviation Disasters,"An exhaustive and thought provoking read - very hard to put down. Air travel is still, and by far, the safest mode of transportation available, and I would still take it over risking my life at the hands of...drivers on our freeways any day. However, in those rare instances when things do go seriously wrong in flight, the results are usually horrific. Pilot error, communications failure, mechanical breakdown, catastrophic structural failure - its all here. Gero provides detailed technical explanations of what went wrong, and the ""lessons learned"" from each crash that led to improvements in subsequent air travel that have made it safer for all of us. Highly recommended."
3,Decent book but could have been better.,"This book had brief synopses of most of the world's air disasters since 1950. I liked how it covered some disasters that were notable but not widely covered or long forgotten (e.g. Soviet Bloc air crashes), but I thought it should have gone into more detail about many of the disasters, and the factors that cause them. Some notable disasters (i.e. the British Comets breaking up in 1954) were inexplicably omitted."
1,Bad choice,"The handle on the case broke within 24 hours. My child was so looking forward to a place to keep everything together. It was a big disappointment. Themanufacturer should have put a bit more care into how the case was put together, after all even though it isn't a toy per say, it is housing an expensive piece of electronics."
5,WOW,"one of the best cd that i listen this year in the world musicvary good avishai is amazing playing in the flute, roti and din din sings like an angelsvary good cd"
4,Gorgeous,"I love the photography. Also, the construction and materials are of good quality. I have kept it on my coffee table for awhile now."
3,Lovely and inspiring coffe table book,"This is a lovely picture book with wonderful inspiring bits of writing interspersed which showcases the outstanding work the monks are doing with their dogs. However, those seeking hard-core how-to info on dog training will benefit more from the monks' other books: ""How to be your Dog's Best Friend"" and ""The Art of Raising a Puppy."""
5,wonderful...,"A great gift for any dog lover. While not hefty in size or word count, this book speaks volumes of truth about dogs and their relationship with people. The photographs, of the monks' german shepherd dogs and other, almost random canines, are both amazing and amusing."
4,I and Dog: Photos and Reflections worthy of Meditation,"For anyone who has shared a life with a dog, this book is a must read. The Photos are beautiful and display that special relationship which is possible between dogs and people. The reflections, especially the last one about hope, are cause for quiet meditation. All the better if your dog is near! This is a great book to share with fellow-dog lovers as a present.Rev. Michael John Witt"
3,Tiffany inspired Silver O earrings,"This item came very nicely packaged which I appreciated. What I did not like however was when I tried to take off one of the earring backs, it broke off after a gentle tug. I was not impressed with the quality of this product in realtion to it's cost."
2,Phasing is awkward,"I agree with the review from ""A music Fan"" who said Angel's phasing is awkward. I was able to listen to this at a store and totally agree that Angel's phasing is awkward and unnatural. For instance, Adelita sounds stiff and brittle, very unsatisfying."
3,Angel Romero: Spanish Guitar,Love the music. 24th cut will not play on 3 cd players. Purchase such a bargain not worth returning. Will not order from this seller again. Why take a chance. Sorry.
3,"Loved it, but mine broke.","I haven't used mine a whole lot, but I was impressed with the features and usability. It comes with USB and FireWire connections, but the USB cable is only for transferring still pictures from the SD card to a computer, and the FireWire (IEEE 1394) port is only for transferring video to/from the MiniDV tape.After about three years, the FireWire port stopped working on mine, so I have some tapes that I can't directly transfer to my computer. I could still use the analog ports to transfer the movies to another recorder, but I was primarily using my computer for this. Evidently other people have had this problem, and repair is not very cost-effective. I can still record and play videos, but I can't transfer them digitally without borrowing a working MiniDV camera, or buying a cheap used one."
3,Good camcorder but ........,I bought this camcorder recently and I am satisfied with its performace. The only reason I am taking off a few ** (stars) from this product is due to the reason that you cannot transfer videos from MiniDV to your computer using USB port. It required IEEE 1394 firewire cable (Cannon does not supply this cable with the camcorder) and a computer which has compatible port (not common in many computers and so you end up buying a suitable card for your computer if you wish to transfer the videos).
4,Decent watch for the money.,"I feel satisfied with purchase of this watch. I think it is a fair price. I bought it from Passing the time, so the shipping was next to nothing. A good durable and good looking watch. And timex brand ensures quaility/ I reccomend this watch for someone looking for this style."
3,Well...it's a closet rod...,"It's a little flimsy if you extend it close to the 72"" limit, but not dangerously so.Why the end brackets have flanges is beyond me...it seems that they should be completely flat..."
3,"Less than best, but mostly true to original story","Growing up we had a book with a record. This video is not the same as that book, does not explain the instruments as per the animals, nor give names to them all, BUT as dated 1950 something it is cute and comes with some other older stories. The basic story line is accurate and very acceptable for children of all ages."
4,Fun stuff from the Golden Era of pop vocals,"'Forties crooner Dick Haymes gained fame singing with bandleader Harry James during a fabled 1939-1941 association wherein he was famously brought in as the replacement for bobbysoxer idol Frank Sinatra. This disc is a swell set of live 1943-1950 radio performances, capturing Haymes at his most nakedly Sinatra-esque. This chronologically arranged, 31-song set is generously programmed and well-paced, more fun and more engaging than other Haymes collections I've heard, and more lively than many of his studio performances. Great between-song banter with Haymes and the various bandleaders and announcers. Recommended!"
4,Bicycle Lifters,"This is a nice product, well made and looks great. My only complaint is that the cords were not long enough for my garage height of 10 ft. so I needed to go into town to purchase a spool of cord and cut the length that I needed."
3,Kettler Bike Rack,"Easy installation, does the job intended. One negative > The rope is too short for a 10 foot ceiling. Bike does not reach the floor with rope fully extended. You have to lift it off the hooks before it touches the floor"
4,"Great product, but...........","Lifter works great, however, the rope/pulley is not long enough for high ceiling garages. We had to purchase a longer pulley and stretch out the space between the cleats on the wall to wrap the excess rope. Otherwise, we are pleased with the bicycle lifter."
1,"Not for anyone other than physicists, mechanical engineers, or obsessed steam fans.","WARNING: Think carefully about this information prior to purchasing this book. There is nothing simple about this book. Prerequisite courses in physics, and mechanical engineering are required prior to attempting to understand this book. A purchase of this book is a complete waste of money. First of all, it is about British steam. Second, it is about as interesting as attempting to read and understand a copy of a Shakespeare play written in Latin. It is by far the worst purchase I have ever made."
3,Hmmmmmm...,"This book was so so. I got it at the library. My fav part about it was that there was a very good pictorial description of how the baker valve gear works. The rest was sort of boring and extremely technical. On the other hand, if you like technical books, this is for you. There are lots of graphs and equations and the like."
3,Interesting book,"I like this book, it is full of tons of information. I kind of feel that it lacks a section giving the very basics at the very beginning. Instead it just sort of launches in, and you have to put it together. It is kind of like having to picture a forest in your head from a book giving lots of minute details about each tree.I would also prefer higher quality graphics and pictures, since I like to really visualize and see mechanical things.The authors understanding of the subject matter is absolutely amazing though, and as far as I know there are no other books like this out there."
5,A Treasure Chest of Information on Steam Locomotives,"This book is nothing less than a ""Classic"" in the best sense of the word. It offers comprehensive coverage of the design evolution of steam locomotives and the issues that shaped its development until overtaken by diesel traction. The explanations are thorough without significanr recourse to mathemetics. Anyone with a keen interest in the history of technology or the era of steam powered rail transport will find this well written book a treasure."
2,a strange mix of good and awful...,"If you already know everything about Steam, then you'll probably find this good in places and boring in most others.If you DON'T know your steam inside-out, then you may be left utterly flumoxed as the authors leap from idiot-guide to super-in-depth in a single paragraph and back again. You'll be left asking What The Hey Are They Talking About?Parts were fascinating - but generally a book written by experts who've forgotten (or never knew) how to write for The Rest Of Us."
4,"Good, if not perfect","First of all, ignore the reviews that call this book ""too complicated"" or, (laughably by a previous reviewer) ""wrong""(!) One of the authors was a CME (chief mechanical engineer) for British Rail, for heaven's sake. If you think it is wrong, back up your argument with facts. Anyone who didn't sleep through high school physics or chemistry should have no problems with this work. Just remember that this book is aimed at enthusiasts, not casual readers sifting through the bookstore remainder bin. OK, now this book could benefit from better editing and a glossary of terms, but it remains the only detailed guide to steam locomotive operation and specific mechanisms in the general press. For other intelligent reviews of this product, please refer to amazon uk's listing of this book."
1,worst book ever,IT IS A VERY INSPIRING BOOK I REALLY HATED IT SO THANK YOU FOR WRITTING IT! IT REALLY TOLD WHAT WAS HAPPENING!
1,yuck,"I used to like these kiddy books when I was little, but not anymore. I mean, how unrealistic can you get? And hasen't anyway noticed the plot of every book is THE SAME???!!! For each book, the plot goes like this: helping horses is more inportant than showing, Anna-or-whatever-her-name-is always gives up showing, which is of course because she is just too scared to lose, the horses never die, things always work out in the end or in the next book. I mean, really, YEAH RIGHT!!! There also really boring. I totally reccomend Thoroughbred instead."
5,One of the best in the series!,"But probably the saddest so far =(...But this book is great, Lauren Brooke writes with so much emotion...It's not one of those happy-go-lucky series, which is why I've fallen in love with these books!!! In Darkest Hour one of the horses comes down with equine flu, and soon more horses have the flu including Nick Halliwals horse that he sent to Heartland, Ty and Amy are up to their neck trying to care for them while Heartland is under quartine, and Ben is being selfish only worrying about the show season and not about Red's own health. Plus the heat during the day is intense...and finally when some of the horses start to get better, a tornado devastates the valley, and a tree trunk is rammed into the barn where the horses are, and after the storm nothing is the same...But I'm not going to give away the ending...It's a great book...it makes you wanting more"
4,Fingers Crossed . . .,"These books are lovely, but like my mom says they are soap operas. That's okay -- I LOVE them! I really like this book and I knew all along that Daniel liked Amy, but I never thought he'd go as far as he did in this book. I was hoping something would happen to Ty so Amy would realize how important he was to her and he would see it, but I never thought this would happen! I just hoped he'd get sick or something! My fingers are crossed -- I hope he doesn't die! These books are kind of all alike but I love them anyway, and I can't wait for the next one!"
2,Outdated,"This is the first book that I have ever felt the need to return. I am sure this book was a huge help a few years ago, but unfortunately at this point it is largely outdated."
3,"this is ""The Trouble"", NOT ""Trouble""","I know nothing about this band, but I wish to warn prospective buyers that this band is called ""The Trouble"" and are not affiliated with the doom/rock/heavy metal band ""Trouble"". Thanks!"
2,Looks great but...,"...doesn't keep time well. The track record on these lower end models is rather horrible. The gears tend to slip, skipping time and often sticking completely. The date is also hit and miss as it will advance with no easy method of reversal.The face does have additional detail which can not be seen in the image, having rings surrounding the dial. Not recommended."

5,What a great Band!,"2009 has been a year of ups and downs....and I'm DOWN ON THIS ALBUM! If you think sleaze like early Ratt and Motley were good, then combine that with Punk and here's what you get = the Sex Slaves! First what a great LP cover! Their second release is equally eye catching. As for this LP/CD, from start to finish it's down to earth nonstop party Rock! And when you get to the Jack Daniels song, it almost makes you wanna go out and buy some and and drink 'til you see Jesus! Now stop reading this and buy or download the album. If you don't like then yell at me.....but you won't, Rock On!"
1,Wrong message to kids,"Sticks and Stones tries to warn kids about guns and the danger of them. It really sends the opposite message! This movie is dangerous because it glamorizes the use of a gun to solve a problem. In light of the Columbine Massacre, this film should be pulled from circulation because it may be seen by another potential ""kid with a problem"" (A Harris or Klebold) who could be influenced this wrong Message. I was appalled that Hallmark Entertainment allowed themselves to be connected to this film. They should reconsider marketing this dangerous film."
1,Do not buy this movie,"This has to be one of the worst films I have seen. I was appauled by the amount of swearing that was involved with this movie, I was hoping to show it my kids but was shocked. Also, shame on Kirstie Alley ang Gary Busey for starring in this terrible film."
5,One of the best!!,"I taped 'Sticks and Stones' when it first came on TV and I still have to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen for ages. The movie is brimming with emotions, teenage angst and is bound to bring back memories if you've been bullied but it only goes to show that sometimes, the bullies are miserable people themselves and there's a reason behind their actions. I'm 16 but I think the movie is suitable for everyone because there are certain aspects we can relate to, regardless of our age. Joey (Justin Isfeld), Book (Max Goldblatt) and Mouth (Chauncey Leopardi) were very convincing as the bullied kids.Some scenes are quite angsty and there *is* swearing but it's really not that bad! The music was cool, and it's a breath of fresh air to watch a movie that's centered on the lives of children rather than adults. When I'd finished watching this movie, I actually felt something for the characters and empathised with them,which is why I'd definitely recommend it."
5,Great Movie,"This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It was sad, but it's good because it shows kids (& anyone) how it feels when you are bullied. This was just a movie, but this really happens to kids everywhere around the world. I would reccomend this movie to anyone. Great movie."
3,Shades of greatness,"3 1/2Even back when this legendary jazz guitarist was starting out in the mid 60's, it was completely obvious he was to be a genius in that domain. Overall we have a traditional hard bop band, blown out of proportion by this man's brilliant runs of course, but incorporated rather well into many songs and even intelligently contrasted by a few surprisingly integrated vocal tracks."
1,Compadres,"I rated with one star this item because How can I judge this CD if I did not hear this CD yet?. You should allow to play some tracks of the CD. I like very much Oscar Lopez, in fact I have all his CDs except this one"
4,Brust continues with the adventures of Vlad Taltos,"The two books in this volume, Athyra and Orca, differ from the other volumes up to this point in the series in that they are not primarily narrated from the point of view of the Vlad Taltos. While it is interesting to hear from the views of others, including that of a jhereg (the creature), some of the narrative is less compelling than in earlier books.By all means, if you have gotten this far into the series, do read these. I just personally found the narrative from multiple viewpoints less appealing than the single-point narrative in the earlier volumes."
3,Eh... not that great,"This book must have been a re-issue of the individual books. This one has Orca and Athrya.Not a starting point for anyone.In fact, it's hard to say what exactly the starting point is since the author gives a different opinion on where to start as well.These two books take the main character, Vlad, out of his usual role. In fact, he's almost a backup character in these books. I found myself getting bored quickly and just plodded through these two books looking for an adventure that wasn't there.And I did like some of the others ones. Just not this."
4,Good - but getting worse,"This set of stories is good indeed, but not as good as the first ones. Brust seems to bob up and down in this series."
3,Vlad Taltos Self Analysis,"I think combining these two novels within one cover was a good idea. Athyra would not have ranked high as a stand alone. I'm not quite sure why but I didn't care nearly as much for it as I have the rest of the books. Vlad spent too much time in introspection, I think. Orca got back to having a little more action and interplay between characters. I found it much more entertaining. There are quite a few references to the previous stories so I would try diligently to read the preceding books prior to these two. Orca contains little tidbits that very innocuously tie the series tighter. I also liked the easily seen comparison to the predatory practices of many of today's corporations so clearly shown in the sub-prime mortgage debacle. Combined I have to recommend you read this book."
5,Great read!,This is a cross between fantasy and gangster books. It is great!. I love this series of books. I have read and reread them because of the writing and the tale.
3,"The Good, the Bad, and the Assassin","The interesting thing about Steven Brust and his writing is how he has a completely different style for each story or series he writes (Read the Khaavren series, or 'To Reign in Hell', or everything he has written). With 'Athyra' and 'Orca', he actually changes style within a series.'Athyra' picks up where 'Phoenix' ends. Phoenix, however, had a much more maudlin ending, with our hero leaving his friends and family behind. It makes sense that, for most of this book, and continuing in 'Orca', a depressing air hangs over the characters, but Vlad slowly comes to terms with who and what he is, and the final exchange between Vlad and Keira that ends 'Orca' shows some of his old wit returning.These two tales aren't quite the 'stand alone' novels the rest of the series is made of, but well worth the read, just to keep you up to date on all things Dragaeran. By the way the books are titled, one hopes the series will run for eighteen volumes, but only time will tell."
5,Good Lid,"Well, the quality of this lid reminds me of the ""Revere"" of old ? ? It is ""ROUND"" and is REAL ""STAINLESS STEEL"" ! ! I have only used it a few times so far, but it is performing beyond my expectations ! !Now days when you order Revere Cookware, you don't know what you will get ? ? There is some of it that is advertised as ""Stainless"" and it isn't ! ! A magnet wont stick to stainless steel, at least the quality that should be used for cookware ! !"
1,Doesn't fit,"The lid didn't fit my mother-in-law's 12 inch pot. It was off by a fraction of an inch. The pot was not Revereware, however, 12 inch lid should fit in a 12 inch pot. It wasn't worth the shipping to send it back, so I kept it, though I don't know what the heck I'll use it for."
4,"Good, but not bright enough","I use this around my leg when riding a bike and when running. It is a solid product, but I have 2 complaints. Firstly, it isn't bright enough, and the brightness isn't consistent, and is stronger closer to the button. The second issue I have is that the lit portion of the strap only goes half way around the leg, so it is more useful as an arm band. Overall a solid product, but hopefully the next generation will be better. Cheers."
3,Loosens Easily,"Loosens easily, I use it on my arm when I'm running or cycling in the mornings. I constantly have to retighten the strap. The led lights work great."
5,Great piece of safety gear,Definitely the coolest and most effective way to be safe and seen if you're on the road in a low light situation. I wear mine running and cycling. Very compact and light weight. A quality product.
1,Excellent music (if you can hear it),"The CD has some extremely good renditions of The Messiah. I have to admit that the performance was indeed some of the best I have heard. Unfortunately it was recorded poorly. So poorly that my CD player had to be turned up to full to hear it and then I had the static to contend with. As good as an album as it is, it was lost due to to bad recording techniques. Take my advice and spend a few extra bucks on another Handel CD."
1,For my Dad's generation maybe,"I'm halfway through the book and have found it to be of little use. As I am reading through, the only thoughts that come to mind are how this would have benefited my Mom and Dad who are 69 years old. I don't feel the author is in touch with todays generation say between 30 - 40 yrs. old. My experience has been that the men I have dated don't necessarily fit into all his stereotypes. Conversely myself and my girlfriends don't necessarily fit the female stereotypes the author describes. I would not recommend the book"
2,long and drawn out,This book is hard to keep focused on. I ended up going to the last pages in a matter of minutes. I've read better.
2,Redundant,I got bored reading the first chapter or so. I just went to the last part of the book and read the summaries. Useful and concise.
4,If you could sit in a roomful of men...,"...and ask them anything you want, you will probably find it here. This is next to the best thing. You will read things like: understanding him in a relationship, why sometimes he likes to be alone and why you can't change him and what happens if you try. For more of a deeper understanding about men, this is the one to read. It's a, ""ahhh, now I know"" kind of a book.Perry Rose, author of I Love You...Will You Marry Me?!"
5,"Fans of ""the secret of"" collection",We are fans of the secret of collection. We really enjoyed this and the secret of anastasia.
1,poor product,"junk, cheap ,dont buy wont do nothing,wont hold nothing,rip off.pure and simply.its to hard to just trust amazon to sell good products anymore.i wont buy anything from them any more..the company has lost its ,care for the customer.and dont care who sells what or how the product is,.sad i love the products in the past.but now its dog eat dog......"
5,"Exciting, moving, exotic--a genuine delight","Preiss's collection gives parents and children a simple, exciting sampler of stories from around the world. The production values are fantastic, and my nieces and nephews have loved trying to sound out the original language text (included with English translation). This has also been one of the two most sure-fire gifts I've ever given--10/10 people have taken the trouble to follow-up with thanks and surprise. I just can't believe this has gone out of print. Snap up a used one right away."
1,Don't buy this kettle,"well, it's my first return to Amazon, followed by my second. This kettle blows steam out the edges of that big opening right onto the handle. Picking it up is risky business. It leaks water. I used to have a Revere kettle I loved, this one is nothing like it."
1,Makes a wet sloppy mess,"After noticing that most kettles get poor reviews I picked this one because I trusted the Revere brand more than the others. Unfortunately, with this kettle, much of the water pours down the gap between the inner steel neck and the plastic collar, to which the handle is a part of, and comes out the base of the neck. There's no way to tighten the collar, so this is exactly what you would expect to happen. I tried to take the kettle apart and fix it myself, but it seemed more trouble than it was worth. With the level of technology that mankind has reached, how is it that there's still a kettle that dribbles all over itself?"
2,If you like low-budget imitators!,"This is not creative like the ""Scary Movie"" series or ""Don't Be a Menace to South Central When Drinking Your Juice in the Hood."" This is a little ""Starsky and Hutch"" with ""Bad Boys"" with ""Lethal Weapon,"" and maybe even some ""Rush Hour."" ""Reno 911: Miami"" had me cracking up, but this left me non-plussed. Clearly, Flavor Flav just said, ""Show me da money!"" and signed on for his bit part. Predictible characters, bad acting, predictible outcomes: trust me, you've seen this before. Only people who were as absolutely bored as I was would bother to see this."
4,Very Funny Movie!,"I rented this movie at Netflix and liked it so much I bought a copy. For an independent film, I thought it was very funny and I love rapper Flava Flav! I just wanted to see more of him. Though the plot was predictable, I enjoyed seeing hot babes and laughing- Me and my buddies watch it when football is boring. Hey- even its predictable at times. This is a funny damn underground film. 4 stars!"
1,I do not recommend,"This is use less toy.It looks good.My 9 months old don't like it.Neck looks like spring, but neck is hard to bend.Two legs were attached. Not much movement in wings.Overall there is no free movement either in neck or legs.I don't recommend this toy."
5,Fantastic,"This is fantastic! I almost didn't buy it and thought of going with straps, but I'm glad I did. The weave is so much sturdier and easier to work with. I never feel like the load is not secure, and it looks great too. I have squeezed so much stuff under the net, it's not funny. No matter how much or little I cram on the roof, it still holds it firmly. Yes, it's a pita when it gets hooked on each other, but its not like it's knotted. I might spend 5 or so seconds of unhooking it... so it's not really even worth mentioning. Totally recommend this net x10."
5,Worked well,"Product fits the megawarrior well and has the hooks designed specifically for the megawarrior. If you have the megawarrior get this net, otherwise a cheaper net would do."
1,The Minotaur's Island,"I have never seen it. I haqve seen other Bettany Hughes history series on Australia's public TV network, the ABC and they are all great *****.I was surprised to find out that I cannot view the DVD because it is region specific. So what a waste of money. This has never been the case before with DVD's purchased from the US. I have assumed that if ""released"" the region specific thing was not an issue. This series is years old - why the embargo still?"
4,my Minotaur Island review!,"I've redone my review with pictures on a blog of mine Jacob Bronowski ""Scientific Humanism"".I'll post the link in the comments."
5,The Nomination,I was thoroughly entertained when I read this book. It was an easy read and it flowed smoothly. The characters in the book were very interesting and kept you guessing. The story line was great. I am anxiously awaiting his next book. John Grisom don't have anything on Fredrick Williams. This is a must have book.
5,A Political Thriller!,"In The Nomination, author Frederick Williams pens a gripping tale that weaves drama, intrigue, love, and politics into a wonderfully entertaining mystery.Mr. Williams' vivid character portrayals and descriptions of our Nation's capitol demonstrate his mastery of the artform as well as his extensive knowledge of Capitol Hill and the Washington, D.C. area.Readers will find this book thoroughly enjoyable. I highly recommend it!"
4,If you like John Grisham you will like Frederick Williams,"I have read all of the John Grisham's thrillers and a friend told me that I should read Frederick Williams' The Nomination because it is also a thriller and that friend was definitely right. Once you read chapter 1 you won't be able to put it down until you finish it. He tweeks your interest with his secret character prisoner number 14, you will want to read on to find out who that prioner is and what crime he committed. Congratulations to Frederick Williams because he matched Grisham's ability to capture the readers' attention and keep you reading until the end."
4,A great historic guide,"Visiting the USA back in 92' I got hooked on baseball and wanted a general outline of how the game developed, was organized, played professionally - and of course I also wanted the stories of legends and get my hands on some of the triva, we europeans never heard of before. ""Our Game"" gave all that to me, and more. Well written, with a rock-solid historic overview, this book is a great historic guide for a true baseball-novice like myself. I will add, that I have a college degree in history and therefore can compare ""Our Fame"" with other historic monographs. In my opinion it rates among the best. To me it was meant as a booster and from here I moved on to read more detailed studies and books on the subject"
2,"antiquated, inadequate","Professor Alexander is a pioneer is the field of sports history, but his short history of baseball pales in comparison to what has cme since. He never fails to take a potshot at his betes noire, nor cackle over his pet theories, making this a hard read."
3,"good history, bad writing","To learn of some of the obscure and not-so-obscure baseball history lessons, this is a good read. That's worth 3 stars. The self-gratification and self-indulgence the author does throughout the book left me wondering if he was not just a bit full of himself while he penned about our pasttime. I enjoy some of the facts of baseball included here but would have enjoyed a thinner version without all of the bragadocious ways of the author."
4,"Spider-Man, 80s, Vulture Has Landed [VHS]","There where 13 Tapes released by Best videoSpider-Man - Vulture Has Landed [VHS]c This is second video release of the epsoide.The first release was from Prizm through the first had two cartoon from 60,s Spider-Man cartoon with it . Collector should look for this Second release cause it contianed rare spiderman trailers like maxiam carnge game trailer and a rare live vote trailer the video is from another time and is not up to todays standards.The series ran for total 26 epsodies and 13 VHS tapes each with one epsoide by best video in 90,s was released.The 13 VHS Tapes wasMarvel Matinee vol.1 Spider-Man in Bubble ,Bubble, Oil & Trouble DR. Octopus stars Running 69 Mins. IS Rare hard to find this release and this not part of the prizm marvil superhero liabery released in early 80,s."
3,Book adequate for ages 7 -11 years of age,"This book is geared towards children. As a parent who bought the book for an almost 5-year old child, I found the pages a bit cluttered. It was hard for my child to stay focused because there was so much going on that it seemed to distract her. I would have preferred a more organized, straight-foward approach.There are several appropriate tunes that children will enjoy.I would recommend this book for children ages 7 through 11."
4,Usborne Piano Course Book 1,"My seven year old daughter has almost completed book 1 and we have just ordered book 2. The book kept her attention. It presented information in an entertaining, reinforcing manner. It was helpful in encouraging good fingering; reading most lines on the treble and base clefs; reading whole-1/2-& 1/4 notes; & understanding some of those bothersome Italian words. I hope book 2 is as good."
2,A little too cluttered,"I borrowed this book for my 4 year old daughter as part of her homeschooling for Kindergarten. I was very glad that I didn't buy it. Although I'm a big Usborne fan, this book moves very quickly with several concepts on each page and no repeat lessons. The pages are very colorful and the cartoon characters are cute, but the pages are so cluttered with information and speech balloons that they become a distraction and definitely not learner friendly. I did, however, like that it begins with the notes labeled by letter A,B,C, etc instead of finger numbers. Instead of this book I ended up buying Hal Leonard's First Piano book, which is excellent. It moves nice and easy and is very clear and consise giving enough time for practice before moving onto new concepts. Before buying the Usborne book, I recommend borrowing it from the library to see if it's appropriate for you. It was not appropriate for us."
3,The Usborne Piano Course: Book One,The publishers of this colorful beginning piano book have discovered the way to draw and keep the attention of young potential pianists. The book's bright colors and visually interesting cartoon characters are entertaining to young children. But the limitations of the content make it most useful for children who don't need more than one practice lesson to learn a concept before moving on to the next. Younger students or those that need more repetitive practice will find it harder to learn from this book. Those students who are highly motivated and easily catch the concepts will find this the perfect book to own and use. In the latter case this may be the right place for your new pianist to begin.
2,Asian Girl with Black Hair,"I did not receive the doll that was pictured. Even though the substitution is cute, it is not the one that I wanted or was expecting. Being too close to Christmas, there is no time for exchange. Had I known that I would not be receiving what was pictured, I could have just shopped in any old retail store."
3,Item not as described,"Just to save someone some money on the shipping cost(for a possible return of the item), the doll was not as described. I ordered an Asian Cabbage Patch doll with black shiny hair. I got a doll with brown curly hair. She was cute but not what I had ordered."
5,Anigmo Switch,"I recently purchased the Dimmer Switch (Incandescent) and found it worked without any problems, and added subtley and functionality to the lighting system in my home. It is easy to install and adds a creative touch (my children are fascinated by it). The plates (coveringthe switch) can be changed to confirm with the interior of any room and after a while, when you get used to it, turning on a light by actually touching a lighswitch seems awkward. Definitely something to have."
5,"Good for small increase still, great for sharp autofocus.",This teleconverter just adds a little oomph to the 70-200 range at the same time it retains the sharp and quick focus/autofocus capability of the lens. Was shipped quickly!
4,Fat Guys DO Kick Ass,"Lots of great shorts with insight on the ""weight"" issue faced by us Americans today. I was, as expected, disgusted by the story about ""hogging."" I just take that as another example of shallowness of most men. Even the ones who truly enjoyed a woman with more meat on her bones would never admit it. Fat women are just not for show. But a word to the fellows: If you do find a woman who is comfortable in her own skin, hang on to her no matter the size, she is a treasure. My favorite stories were Fat Guys Kick Ass and Fat Like Him, and also David Sedaris's story of his sister Amy in her fat suit and makeup bruises. What characters they all are! Thank goodness not everyone aspires to being ""normal!"" How boring would that be?"
2,America is NOT the fattest nation...,"Just to be clear, the World Health Organization reports a list of nations in order of fatness of populations... and America is not on the top of the list... there are many way ahead of us in this domain."
5,An Important Book for Our Time,"Dudley Hall's new book, Glad to Be Left Behind, is one of the most important books to be released in recent years. Hall dares to ask the questions many in evangelical circles have been afraid to raise. Are we really living in the last days? What happened in Jerusalem in 70 A.D. and how does it affect Biblical interpretation today? Where does our generation fall in the overall story of God throughout history? Are there promises yet unfulfilled by God to national Israel?In an easy-to-read conversational style, Hall provokes the reader to an intense study of the scriptures which he gently guides with reading assignments at the end of each chapter.If you are interested in the truth about the Day in which we are living, I highly recommend this book!"
2,nothing new under the sun,"I regret that I coughed up mazuma for this here book. Unfortunately it doesn't consist any new views. What does the publication say ? ""It is a true fact that Jesus has existed. How so ? Because the New Testament says so ! "" This is the only proof the author gives. As far as the rest of his text goes, he just flags away the diskrepancies in the NT as unimportant. It is better to read the actual Gospels themselves, and make your own opinion of the Lamb."
3,Works as expected,Replaced upper flange duw to it failing and leaking. This onme came witha sleeve inside it for some reason and for a bit didnt understand why. I removed the sleeve and tab is level now. They should explain what it is for.
4,Dope cd,"This cd is tight. A little short, but tight. Pastor Troy and his boys get crunk as hell on this album. Best songs on here are Havin' A Bad Day, Look What I'm Going Thru, Ghetto Raised, The Congregation, and Down South Nigga Fa Life. Pick this album up if you can find it!"
5,A Book for All Ages,"I read this the first time when I was in Elementary School (3rd or 4th grade). I loved it then, and even now, years later, I still re-read it. The book has a quality that makes it worthwhile to read- over and over and over!! I recommend it for readers of all ages. Children will love it, especially horse crazy girls! Well worth the price- it's a children's classic that should last for many, many, many years too come.It was also made into a movie (titled ""Misty"" in 1961, hard to find), and has at least two books that come after it. (Stormy, Misty's Foal, Misty's Twilight, and a related but not sequel book: Sea Star: Orphan of Chincoteauge)."
5,A Book That Deserves An Award (by: Angie Watkins),"I would say that it was absoloutly wonderful,i just couldn't pry my eyes off of this collecion of awsome books!!And even though i'm 13,i still couldn't stop reading it.I would highly recomend this book to any of my friends.And what i like so much about this book is that you actually feel like you are there.The way she(Marguerite Henry) writes is just.....well..... beautiful."
5,Wonderful horse classics!,I read most of Margerite Henry's books as a child and loved them very much! I remember the amazement at realizing that Chincoteague and Assateague were real places! I have yet to get to Chincoteague for the pony roundup but I have visited many times over the years. I am buying these for the family library and hope my son grows to love them as I have. He is a little young now at age 3 but I plan to start reading them to him as he gets a little older!
5,The BEST of the best!!!!,"GREAT BOOTS!!! I've owned many ""hunting"" boots over the past 20 yrs. and these are shaping up to be the very best. I love the height on these boots as they add extra protection from the elements. Also, great stability around the ankle and heel for all day support and comfort. Last, good traction for traversing uneven terrain. Plus, Danner offers recrafting on these boots. I've owned several Danner boots and.have taken advantage of the recrafting for prolonged yrs. of service. Take it from me, these boots are well worth the money and Amazon offers the very best price around. If I could make one improvement, I would have Danner offer these exact boots in a non-insulated version. Enjoy!!!"
2,really ticked off,the sole of the boot is comprised of three layers of rubber. three months in and they're already starting to peel apart. might as well buy the $50 made in china pair.
1,Perky Pet Bird Bath,Waste of money. The metal pan corroded and rusted in a matter of months causing the bath to leak.
1,Junk.,"Please don't waste your money. As the last reviewer reported, this rusted through in a matter of (few) months-- and this was an Oklahoma winter, a far cry from Florida. You may as well throw your money down a hole or send it to one of these nice Nigerian people who keeps e-mailing me."
5,Guess How Much I love You border,"This border is adorable and so easy to apply. I love it! I know it was listed in the baby nursery section...but I put it in my kitchen as I am a bunny collector. It really brightened my kitchen up a bit. And the price was so cheap that I was afraid it was cheaply made, but it is top quality. I am so happy with this purchase!!!"
3,"seattle slicker, its an ok product.","The sizes run really large. I wear a large in everything, but this large is too large for me to wear. The large size is way to big for me to wear. Overall it seems ok, not as warm as I thought, but that could be to the excess in size. So be careful when ordering."
3,Not so impressed,"with the overall machine. I am having a very difficult time finding bobbins and replacement needles. I also can not find the large embroidery hoop. Without extra bobbins it's difficult to do more than 1 or 2 colors in the preset patterns, therefore I am just doing names. Not much fun to do those over and over again...I find my machine jams a lot too. Very frustrating."
1,very disappointed,"I bought this machine for my daughter and it worked great for about 6 months, then she began having trouble with the embroidery function. Sadly the machine was not able to be repaired."
3,Brother SE270D It's a #*&$#%&* Lemon,"The first few months it was a beautiful thing. Then it started hanging up in the feed dog. I'd be sewing along on a beautiful embroidery piece, then next thing you know it's hanging up and making a mess of your embroidery. I checked the needle, feedog,thread. I checked the bobbin casing, I don't see amy thing wrong with it, other than every time I get into a project, it hangs up. Quite frustrating!!!!!!I guess mine was made on a Friday or the end of a month. I sure have a lemon. I'm going to put it in the shop. Then I'm going to give it away and buy something else. I Do have a Kenmore Sewing machine that was one of the first ZigZag models. That thing will sew through anything. It just doesn't do embroidery.It was given to me when I was nineteen years old. I'm fifty-seven now. I think I'll get another KENMORE! Have a good Day All."
1,Buyer beware,"I purchased this and the first machine was defective. It was replaced. I received a replacement, which has also died - something with the computer chip this time, not mechanical. It seems one month is the mark where they die out. I'm sure some people have had success, and I WANT success with this, but it just isn't happening. I just hope Amazon will process my refund as I am wary about getting another defective machine!"
3,Brother SE 270D,"It has too many functions, I haven't use all of them, but the one I use (embroidery) doesn't have the quality that other Brother embroidery machines have."
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed in this machine. Although I am a beginner, and also teaching myself, I was hoping it would give more ""self-help"" information in the troubleshooting section. I am at the point now where I've memorized the manual. I don't know if there's really something wrong with the machine or if it's something I'm not doing correctly. I guess that's the chance you take with buying online."
3,Mother's day gift,"I got this as a gift for my mom (74 yrs old) to replace an old broken Singer she has. I was going to get another Singer but the reviews were not that favorable. After looking around, settled on this model. I have to say, it is pretty good. The auto-threading feature is very nifty. The major complaint would be the bobbin winder...it doesn't seem to have the right tension and tangles too easily when winding."
3,HELP,Need some one to help me with my machine. I keep getting FO6 in the LCD and the machine will not operate. Husband purchased the machine new about 4 years ago. Got it out about a month ago and everything went well but yesterday all I could get was F06 and my books don't mention anything about this situation.
5,A Great Machine!!,"This machine was recommended to me by a close relative that is very experienced in embroidering. I was interested in doing some things but didn't want to spend a lot of money on a machine as I didn't know if I would really like embroidering. As a novice, I didn't want to deal with anything too complicated. WOW, what a surprise. I love this machine!! I have never embroidered anything in my life! Opened the machine and within an hour had embroidered my first design. It was only my initials but I couldn't believe how easy it was with this machine. I'm hooked! No doubt I have much to learn about embroidering..but for me, I couldn't have found a better machine! It's GREAT!!! Very happy I chose this machine."
2,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I am on my second machine and still dissatisfied. I had to return the first machine after only a few uses because the automatic threader quit working and whenever I tried to maually thread the machine, it kept telling me that the thread was out.Now I am having many issues with the bobbin thread tangling as I sew and jamming up.This is all just straight stitch sewing, I have not moved on to the embroidery and it looks like I won't. My first $100 sewing machine worked better, harder and longer than this one has. I wasted $400 on this piece of garbage! I will go back to a cheap Singer!"
5,FANTASTIC SEWING / EMBROIDERY MACHINE!!,"I have had this machine for 1 yr now. I have never had a problem. It sews perfectly. All the settings are awesome. Tons of different options. I love how easy it is to thread the machine. You can change the color of the thread in less than 30 seconds. Some of fav. things about this machine are: It cuts the tread for you, you can set the machine to sew by pushing 1 button, so easy to put spin the thread on the bobbin and my favorite thing is satin stiching. I comes with a open foot so you can see what you are doing. It was very easy to set up the embroidery. I love the embroidery on the machine. Mickey comes out perfectly! The directions on this machine are very easy to understand and read. I would highly recommend this sewing/embroidery machine if you love to sew. I also have the Brother serger lock 1034 D that is a great serger for $199."
5,An Album Everyone Must Have,"This is one of those albums that suites every mood. It has feel good songs: (The Garden of You and I & I Can Feel My Heart), making love songs: (Whole Heart & Surface of Your Soul)), telling your lover ""Where They Can Go"" songs: (Conditional & I'm Not Leaving You)and of course my personal favorite: songs that make you have to dance (Lord & Standing Still). Ginger and her music are full of groove and passion at the same time. Her music and lyrics makes you want to be her best friend. She is one of those ultra positive people who has seen the world. You can hear all of this in her music. Everyone I have introduced this album to, has loved it, and has shared it with others as well. You can't go wrong."
1,ehhhhh,gamecube is not the worst but i would rather have a nintendo ds because its just kooler and it fits in yo pocket. its really kool.
5,Love It!!!!!!,I love this cd. It's upbeat and fun. I listen to it everyday. I hope he puts out another cd in this same style. My favorite song is President but Fistibal festival is a close second. There's not a song on here that I don't like. I highly recommend this cd.
5,This is fantastic!,"Before buying this album I only ever saw Wyclef Jean once on TV. He made an impression. So I bought this, my first of his albums, and I can't stop listening to it, especially when enjoying a drive in my car. Interesting, profound, exciting. I love the blend of rapping with creole sound and rhythms. Ooh, and that vibrato wailing that he does better than any reggae artist I've ever heard! Thanks for this one Wyclef! I am surely going to look into more of this music."
4,Great song...rest of the album is okay.,"I really only bought this for one song I heard on the Chappelle Show. ""If I Were President"" is pretty cool."
4,Bon Bagay!,"This is a great CD for anyone who love Caribbean music, especially Konpa Kreyol. Se yon bon bagay ke li ye. Li gen bon mizik ladan."
2,unfortunate change of pace,"coming from a longtime wyclef fan, i am very disapointed by his latest release ""Welcome to Haiti Creole 101."" While I respect Wyclef reaching out to his roots, the music wyclef is reating is flat out disapointing. Almost all of the songs sound alike, with a traditional African dance song sound. Unless you share heritage with wyclef or have some sort of peculiar inteterest, I would not reccomend this album to you. In my eyes (or ears) Wyclef Jean's last two albums have shifted away from thw wonderful songs in the Ecleftic days. The two stars were earned by the one great song on this cd in ""President."" Not only is it an appealing song, but great lyrics complement his vocals. As a loyal Wyclef fan, I hope he decides to return to the form of the great all around musician that he showed us a few years ago, both solo and with the Fugees."
4,"Loverly voice, perfect technique","I noticed her voice a couple of years ago on TBS TV station live concert in Korean. The applause for her was like thouder storm, and since then I remembered her forever.There is no doubt about her voice and technique, which is one of the best among her peers today. But even in her best reviewed CDs and live performances, I always felt there is a little regret, which is the lack of passion. Behind her crystallike and gentle voice, I found the music is second to the technical showoff, or maybe I should say she is so perfect techincally that the music content was overshadowed. While, from another perspective, all her CDs can be perfect text books for students."
5,Aesthetically pleasing,"Sumi Jo's artistry really shines through on this CD. Each phrase of each song is delicately shaped. My Italian grandmother, who can be very critcal, commented on how precise her command of the Italian language is. ""She seems to be fluent in every language. How does she do it?"" she replied after I played her a selection from the CD. Although I have to mention that she thought the paino and voice setting was a bit ""dull"", I believe it provides for a more ""intimate"" setting. If you are not particularly fond of opera and opera arias in general, this is the CD for you. While this is not my all time favorite album Sumi has done, it does in fact rank high on the list of CDs she has released. If you would like to hear more of Sumi Jo, I would recommend the ""Sumi Jo Sings Live at Carnegie Hall"" CD, it is my favorite by the way."
1,Didn't work for me...,"I had no problem getting ink back in the cartridge (process went very smoothly), but when I put the ink cartridge back in the printer (Dell A920 All-in-One printer)and tried to print a few test pages I got poor results at best. Hardly any ink was on the page and after four test pages, it wasn't printing anything.Don't assume you can easily return it either (this isn't wal-mart, where you can just walk in and say this product sucked)... You have to go through a long drawn out process and if you're lucky you may get back 50% of what you paid (and you're out both shipping charges). Now I remember why I don't shop online...."
3,Amazon is selling something slightly different from what you get in stores,"When I received the wheel cover, I noticed that there was quite a bit of dust and storage wear on the ""faux-leather"" surface of the cover. There is also a hard and sharp plastic hem around the wheel cover where the leather is stitched to the rubber. The same wheel covers sold in stores like Wal-Mart do not have this hard plastic hem. I find that this sharp plastic can catch on my gloves or on my hand while turning.The wheel cover itself is a very good design. The faux-leather coating has a lot of traction and the ribbed contours allow your hands to ""stick"" to the wheel without fear of slipping when you least expect it. It would have been nicer if they did not use that hard plastic hem.Overall, I do not recommend buying the cover from Amazon but instead go to a local store and pick one out. I bought it from Amazon to save a few bux along with another item to get the free super saver shipping."
3,Steering wheel cover,"I haven't been able to get it on my steering wheel. It's a little too small. Hopefully, I'll be able to stretch it out some."
5,Like nothing I've heard before!,"I have to thank the previous reviewer for the words on this amazing album! I bought ""Bird in a House"" in the store and was checking around out here. I love the new one but still never heard ""The Black Bear Sessions."" If I hadn't read the previous review I might not have gotten it immediately.This album is completely fantastic!! Sorry I'm no writer and don't know what else I can say except that it's a must have for any CD collection. For me it's up there with ""American Beauty!"" And that's saying a lot for this old Deadhead!"
4,"Great book, lots of fun!","This is a great book for peek-a-boo fans. My 13 month old daughter thinks it's wonderful. The book allows a photo of the child (or anyone for that matter) to be inserted on the cover and allows for a picture on each page as well. The story asks ""Where is baby?"" Then it asks (for instance) ""Under the Crib?"", ""In the Toybox?"" or ""Behind the Curtain?"" On each page, one of the options flips open to find a picture you have added. We've filled ours with various family members and our daughter loves ""peek-a-booing"" and finding Mommy, Daddy, Grandma and cousins!! She reaches for this book again and again. The only reason I've given it four stars not five is that the areas to add pictures aren't terribly user-friendly, they are odd shapes and sizes and the pictures must be glued or taped in, they don't just slip in. I spent a little time but once the pictures were in, it was great. Overall a wonderful choice for children under 3 or so."
2,2 Stars is extremly generous,this cd is all skits basically d3 i so terrible and where is suave and where have your skills gone boys get any other onyx release and sticky's debut skip thissome of the skits are interesting but you buy cds for musicFavorite Track: NoneGuests:X-1Other: This cd was released just to push units for die hard onyx fans3 of 10 lyrics 3 of 10 beats
4,ONYX TEARS IT UP!,"Ok. At first, I was thinking this CD might not be as good as Onyx's last couple. BUT, this record is incredible. My favorite song on this album has to be ""Hurt Something."" The beat is classic Onyx! I definitely recommend buying this album!"
1,second wack album in a row,"Onyx has fallen off bigtime since Shut Em Down. They dont have the same street credibility anymore since back in 93.The beats on Sticky's Decade, Bacdafucup II and now Triggernometry are simply too commercial, too soft and lack the trademark grimeyness in every way + Iceman is a joke on the mic. Do yourself a favor and get the first three and Sticky's Black Trash, dont bother buying this one cause if you like the real ONYX youll be disappointed big time."
1,"ONYX, livin on past glories","Unfortunatly, I cant spell, LOL.No, unfortunatly, Onyx couldnt make there mind up, if they were going to make a retrospect album, or a new one, and, while I was a fan of songs such as Slam back in 1995, its time, for Sticky and co, to realise that they cant just dwindle on old glories. You want something Grimey, look somewhere else, cause all Onyx have to offer in this outing, is reminders of how they were the ones who 1st shouted bout the hood and that they were the ones throwing there guns in the air, well...great, but next time convince the listener through your music, not, your image, which has long gone past cliche...."
1,Not worth a cent,"There is only one song on here that I can listen too and that is ""mama cryin"" Apart from that they did a nice job in filling out the album with an interlude every 2nd song GARBAGE!!Albums worth buying if you haven't already..*** All We Got Iz Us ***AND*** Sticky Fingaz - Blacktrash ***Shut them down has one good song and thats Rob & Vic but really not much more than that... These guys had skill but most of there production/instrumental choices overall was not there style. If they stuck too what they do best they would still be strong in the industry today!Well I think they've now fallen of the face of the planet and well kirk jones is probably still trying to make it in the movie industry.Anyway don't buy this... I probably wouldn't even waste the time downloading it!!"
1,Horrible,"First off I wanna say that I've been an Onyx fan since I was 6 or 7 years old. Maybe 5, I don't know. I was in love with Bacdafucup as a kid and, as you may have already assumed, I was even more impressed with their next two realeases (All We Got Iz Us and Shut Em' Down). However, Triggernometry boasts a poor selection of 10 awkwardly pop-esque ""songs"" and cheesy, unintelligent lyrics that prove to be exemplary of Onyx's shift in tone and mentality. The rest of the CD is basically a commentary by the members about things that they did when they were good. Neither of their last two realeases have even come close to echoing the quality of their first three. IT DOESN'T EVEN SOUND LIKE ONYX. Instead of Bacdafucup II or Triggernometry I'd recommend any of their first three albums (most notably Shut Em' Down and All We Got Iz Us) or Immortal Technique's Revolutionary Vol. 2."
3,For the die hard ONYX fan!,"If you were disappointed with their last album then this makes up for it.This album should have been titled Bacdafucup pt.II being that the skits reminisce about early 90's when they first came out. Also the track ""Da Next Niggas"" pt.2 is as tight as the original version.The only knock on this album is that there's only 10 tracks, but they all bang. The rest are all skits. If you're a die hard you'll enjoy the skits though. Getting to here Sticky unleashed in an interview is as real as it gets and hilarious in grimy sort of way. They talk about knowing Wu-Tang,Biggie,50, and a few others before they got big to being the first group to ""Throw their Gunz."""
5,bile makes me smile,"Its hard not to have a physical reaction to Bile, whether you end up grinning from ear to ear with insane bliss, or gritting your teeth and bouncing off the walls. This is some amazing industrial metal that will dominate your brain and start telling you to do things.. Intense, brutal, loud, frequently changing rhythms & tempos.. It begs to be cranked up to the point where your ears ring, and its worth it."
2,Handle Too Big,The nob on the top of the lid is sticks up much higher than is needed and this makes stacking the licd with other lids a problem in that two lids will not fit in a drawer.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!! WAS RECEIVED IN BROKEN, CRUMBLED CONDITION. NOT IN BRICKS AS ADVERTISED. TOTALY UNUSABLE!!NO CARE IN PACKING OR SHIPPING WHATSOEVER!!"
1,Statistics are not accurate in my opinion,"I am an author on TA. I have articles published by Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodites. Mr. Bulkowski on page 659 says that Rectangle Bottoms, up breakout failure rate is zero!!! Now here is a formation you can't go wrong with, right!? Just trade this formation and you will never lose money! He also states that Rectangles, Wedges, Triangles, Double Bottoms, Broadening formations and so forth have a failure rate of 2%!! Excellant!! We are all going to get rich trading these formation! In chapter 17, page 252, he calls Dogi a Hanging Man! Don't you think he ought to know the difference!! Judge for yourself."
4,Good but need revision,"Technically, this is a very useful book in that it presents hard to find statistics on the patterns like the price expectation, failure rate, very detailed. For example, the author even included a statistic on the volume behavior for the 'head and shoulder' pattern, which is very helpful. -You may not find those facts in any other book. The approach the author took is certainly a step forward towards 'scientific' technical analysis.However, the presentation is poor and too wordy which makes it uneasy to follow, especially when you compare it with the classics like John Murphy ans Steve Nison's. There are too many uneccary words and most of the 'trading examples' are nothing more than stories (it is also not clear if those stories are fabricated or real). They do not contribute to the technical merit of the book but occupy a considerable portion of the book.I'll keep it but do expect a revised version."
4,Lots of Info.,"There was a lot of stuff in this book I didn't need to read, but I suppose it would help out other people. I just got it for the last 5 pages! Take what you need out of it and ignore what you don't. It is a reference book, and it is up to you to decide if you can use it, and how to use it. Personally I prefer Candlesticks, and got a lot more out of the book ""Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques"" by Steve Nison, which is not for everyone, but depends on what type of trading you are doing."
2,method of trading successfully,"is not found here. Wordy beyond tears. Could have easily been 100 pages instead of 600. A mere pretender to the classic by Magee and Edwards.Tedium must be the Bulkowski philosophy. I really felt he did little to clarify any technical view what-so-ever. Every page is an endurance test of what's his point and where to find it. It promises theme, but delivers anecdotes.Loaded with questionable statistics, methodology and wordiness any reasonable trader can only come away with a feeling that this book was written for the sole purpose of making the author a buck.What this book lacks in originality it makes up for in a scholarly pomp. Perfect for a non traders library.The patterns are previous, The tactics non profit. This would be the last book in my trading library."
3,"Put it to the test, secone review","If you use Bulkowski Head and Shoulder trading tactics ( page 273) you will be disappointed. Computer testing (1968 - 1986) produced low profits of only 8.85 NYSE points when using his system.More conditions , such as symmetry of pattern, neckline penetration,and volume confirmation ( decling volume at tops and rissing volume at bottoms) will produce better results.If he uses pivot point channels to define resistance line of HS bottom formation, (neckline in this case) and act on upward breakout. This method will produce 95.93 NYSE points profit.Furthermore, optimized with .75 points trailing stops produced even better results than 1/8 traling stop in his system. In conclusion, this book lacks backtesting and optimizatiuon and therefore its ..."
5,Head and shoulders above the competition,"Hardy har har. Yet I mean it.Most books on TA are simply awful. Finally a scientist (engineer, anyway) has taken his turn. The book is clearly written, with clear looking charts, unlike the other awful texts. But more than that is the scientific approach: OK, let's rigorously formulate what these patterns are, and then test them empirically. A brilliant (though obvious) idea.This is a great beginning, although I think the project is far from over. The focus can be made even sharper, with clearer definitions and methodology. Some ideas need to be scrapped, like the scoring system (which doesn't appear until the end, thankfully). It seems completely nonsensical to me.I have lots of suggestions for Bulkowski's next edition. If the author is reading this comment, he can contact me at wramey@home.com. (Please, that's for the author only.)"
3,Not sufficient testing to produce reliable trading methods,"500 stock charts or 2 years are not sufficient to produce reliable trading rules. Its rather absurd. These charts with Meta Stock (add-on) or Back Track can be used to test most of them over extended priod of time. Or Trade Station if he can write TS Chart patterns program. Then after atleast 10 years of testing, he can write this book.... Free End of Day."
5,Very indepth and good use of statistics,"As a trader myself I am always on the lookout for books and materials that do not tout get rich quick strategies. Mr. Bulkowski takes a very methodical and usefull approach in collecting many common and some exotic chart formations and then documenting how identify, trade, and ultimately reveal their statistical performances. One feature I found pricesless was the visual index in which you can match a formation visually and then figure out what it is called to read more about it. I highly recommend this book for people who are looking for a excellent chart formation book."
2,Yuck,"I could have made a better baby book than this one, and I am not known for my craft skills. The outside cover is a cheap white photo album with gold letters on it. The inside has white paper that looks like is has been photocopied and nothing more. Visually, this book was a HUGE disappointment. We sent it back. This product is so not worth the money."
5,Great Baby Book,"I really like this baby book I have already added about 60 pages to it-for future use, with no problems. I personally love that this book isn't Mom and Dad and my Parents as I am a single parent, that it offers adoptive or segregant mother a page which is also removable if not needed. There is plenty of room to write and not worry about going over the 'limit'. Yes it is 20 more then any other baby book but to have the choice to add and remove as you wish is well worth it especially when you are not a 'traditional' family."
1,Unattractive,This shoe does not look like the picture online. It is much longer which makes the shoe look oversized and unattractive. You can barely tell that the shoe is blue as well.
1,Not compatible with all canon lenses,I bought this teleconverter with a 70-300 sigma lenses and it did not mention anywhere (editorial reviews or specifications) that it is compatible with only a specific number of lenses. But the review for the nikon compatible teleconverter it does so. Make sure before you buy it that it will fit your lenses.
5,need help,does anyone know the name of the song that is played when kevin bacon is in his hollow form and he escapes from the lab and is driving his porsche? He then pulls up to a car with 2 kids and he scares them. does anyone know that song?
4,HOLLOW MAN,"I love the whole soundtrack, especially track one and six are very good, Jerry is a genious. I heard different instumnents in this great soundtrack never before and started listening to this type of music since Batman soundtrack. Keep up the good music,Jerry."
3,Song played when he drives his porsche?,Does anyone knows the song that played on the background when Kevin Bacon drives his porsche??
4,The Master is back!,"Last summer Mr.Goldsmith wrote two good score The Mummy and Hauting. But this summer 2000, there are only One Goldsmith's score. Such a great movie with another collaboration with director Paul Verhoeven (Verhoeven alternate with his two composers Goldsmith and Poledouris). Now, Goldsmith returns to his Old '80 style with his electric sound like The Burbs or Gremlins... The music doesn't like his predecessor. It's not the same STYLE like The Hauting, or The 13th Warrior. it's a Mature score. Then, we have a great orchestration but the main theme are particular quite LESS. Track #1 is Beautyful and outstanding, with incredible strings.The first track is the best moment on this album. Probably one of the best NOTES Goldsmith ever wrote until 5 same years I agree with our friend Mr Staley, this is a great score. But even the main theme are ''abandonné'' the rest of the album is an energytic music from the Master of FilmMusic, Mr. Jerry Goldsmith."
5,Educo Workbench,Awesome. My 2 year old loves it! Solid construction and no paint to worry about chipping off (lead) - its all stained. Nice!
4,another great disc from a great anime series...,"great disc, great price, plays wonderfully. i've loved this series for a few years now.now i'm just waiting on the studio to catch the anime up with the manga series."
4,ugly doll,I thought the doll I got was the really ugly.My granddaughter thought she was the prettiest thing she has ever gotten.What do I know about baby dolls.
4,Hmm.,"It's pretty funny how these dolls have come back. My grandmother used to give these to us when we were kids, and now my mother is giving these new ones to my kids.It makes me feel old, but oh well."
1,cabbage patch doll,product shows doll with certain accessories but did not come with the same ones.sent it back
1,DID NOT RECEIVE THE DOLL I ORDERED!!!!,"My daughter anxiously awaited the delivery of the doll she picked out herself on the computer and when we received her doll she was very disappointed it was not the doll we ordered at all. Also, I would like to add that we did not received the doll within 24hours it took 5 days to recieve a doll that was not the one we even ordered. We were all very disappointed. This was my first shopping experience with amazon and I will not be returning."
1,Worse performance than my wireless-G router,"I bought this router because my new laptop had wireless-N technology. However, it took forever to get the router to work with my laptop with encryption enabled. Then, when I finally got it work, the signal strength/range was no better than my G router. The router's speed was worst of all. Compared side-by-side the download and upload speeds for my G router were consistently better by a considerable margin. I tested the speed using multiple websites and the wireless-G router was always better. None of the suggestions from the Linksys website helped improve the speed. I don't even use it anymore. I just use my G router for everything, although I haven't had the heart to disconnect it altogether because I paid $70 for it. I'm secretly hoping that Linksys releases a miraculous firmware upgrade that will fix it."
2,I should have read the reviews first,"For some reason, instead of reading the complete reviews I just trusted the Linksys brand and went ahead with the purchase. Well, I'm regretting that now because I'm stuck with a wireless router that doesn't have a range of 10 meters inside my house.I even tried installing DD-WRT and increasing the Tx power and nothing worked.Linksys normally makes good products but this one just didn't live up to the brand name."
2,Not Compatiable with XBOX LIVE- Very easy to start,"With XBOX Live, it will change the NAT to moderate. Its very easy to use and with the cd its very easy to setup but for gaming, this isnt good."
1,Very frustrating...,"Wow. I just spent 4 hours at my sisters house trying to get this thing to work. I have set up quite a few wireless routers for friends and family, mostly Netgear WGR614 and Linksys WRT64G routers (with zero problems). I must say that I have never had as much trouble getting a wireless router to work properly... and even gave up in the end and told her to return it. I could get a wired connection, log in to the router do the setup and get the wireless to working until I enabled WEP, then I could connect to the router fine but loose my Internet connection. Also the web page configuration locked up on several occasions forcing me to reboot the router. It's funny how folks either love or hate this router... I guess I fall into the later category."
2,bad 802.11n throughput,"This router is easy to configure, reliable for internet browsing. But for high-speed wireless file-transfer, this router is too slow.I use wide-channel (40MHz), my laptop recognize it as 300Mbps access-point. When transferring data from a computer directly attached to this router (Ethernet) to a laptop, downloading speed is very poor, in average about 1.5-2.5MBps. Upload is better, about 4MBps. The worst thing is the periodic drop of speed in download mode (It does not crash, just speed drops in a range of several kilo byte per second)I have tried different band and channel (20MHz or 40MHz), nothing helps.One more bad thing: the ""Security"" LED never lights, and the button on top of the router is useless.Try D-Link DIR-655: very reliable 802.11n performance, about 4MBps downloading, 4.5MBps uploading."
2,"G Access Works, N Access Doesn't Work","I bought this product to replace my old G router along with the Linksys USB N adapter. The N connection to my desktop has been nothing but trouble. Constant dropped signal, adapter and/or router locked up, repeated resets of the connection...you get the idea.The product looks well-made and Cisco is a good, known brand.As I type this review I'm using a network cable to the router in order to use my desktop.My opinion is that the Draft-N technology is too new and needs to be more thoroughly tested and perfected before use by the public."
1,Relentlessly bad,"Even with the 0.92.6 firmware, the wireless speed is a small fraction of what I got with my cheap trendnet mimo router (using an IBM T41p with internal wireless-g). Also, the access controls page is limited to ""deny xxx"" rather than ""allow only xxx"". Finally, they have the worst looking, most confusing web interface I've ever seen (and I've seen a LOT of routers). Do yourself a favor and skip this!"
4,works well,"The device works well, as supposed to. Do not use WPA/PK2 unless you have other linksys wireless cards connecting to this router. Wireless devices from other manufacturers are not compatible with this (PK2). Instead use WPA/PK which works fine, or WEP.I must say I am happy with it."
2,Ok with open source firmware,"Out of the box, this router can barely run its own management software. Fortunately there's a version of the open source DD-WRT router software that works great. Once I switched to DD-WRT the router has been solid ever since. The range is still less than my older wireless router for which this was a replacement. (With DD-WRT, I'd give 3.5 stars.)"
1,Not enough product development before release,"This item, while producing much greater speed to other wireless N devices, required periodic power recycling (reboot) and finally stopped working altogether. Cisco systems released this technology too soon. I retrofitted my network with my old WRT54G (wireless G) and have never had a problem since. Wireless G = Good. Wireless N = Bad!!!!"
1,Buyer Beware,"We purchased this in September, and by November it no longer worked. We tried unsuccessfully to contact customer service by phone and finally was able to reach tech support over the internet. Unfortunately, he was unable to make this work...Something about us having the wrong software (which doesn't make sense-we used what came with the unit). We were utterly frustrated...It was a waste of money!"
1,Don't even bother with this one...,"I've dealt with a lot of routers, and when I rec'd this one for Christmas, I was actually excited. I unpacked the contents, and immediately noticed the lack of documentation. I followed the limited information and four hours later, still had no wireless connection. The wired router works fine, but wireless capability is not happening.This product makes an interesting conversation piece, but other than its use as a paperweight, it serves no purpose.This product should come with a ""no gift"" clause. I wouldn't wish this much trouble upon anyone."
1,Cost-to-Function ratio is ZERO...,"I've been a user of Linksys products for many years and when this router became available I purchased it. However, I was not able to setup the router with my existing network. It was cumbersome to setup, was not consistent with connectivity. I ended up returning the item and staying with my G router which is working just fine."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!,"I just bought the WRT300N, V 1.0, brought it home and tried to run the setup CD. The setup CD got stuck at the password page, I messed with that for 15 - 20 minutes, called tech support and they informed me that the setup CD was faulty. They walked me through downloading the setup file online and told me to call back if I had problems --- my computer would not recognize the router at all. I called back, they walked me through the manual set-up, we got to the end and I could not connect on line at all. Tech support thought it was my phone that was the problem, then they thought my router was too close to my computer....I finally gave up and am going to take the #$%&ing; thing back.Save your self two or three hours of anquish, buy a different product."
1,Go with Netgear instead; this one does not work as advertised,"This product does not work as advertised. Netgear has a much better product out now that costs roughly 150 at comp-usa. I'm on the first floor, and the Netgear is on the second floor, roughly 50 feet away, and I still get full strength! Try that with linksys. It just doesn't work.The range does not work on linksys.The speed does not work.The connection, even when successful, can go out at any time.Customer support is always there, but they will not solve your problem. They will have you uninstall and re-install, and waste time, because they can't tell you that this product should have never been mass-produced and does not work as advertised; they know the truth but are not allowed to disclose it.It will work well only on short range, but not through walls."
1,Not quite all there...,Make sure if you are on a server that you religiously copy your old router settings and then really consider if you need this router or not. I thought I could just use the settings from my old router and how wrong I was. By ready to re-configure your whole ip scheme and deal with a whole new set of security settings for wireless.
5,Linksys WRT300N Wireless-N Broadband Router,"No issues setting up the Linksys WRT3000N. I plugged it in, configured the router using a wired connection and default IP address then switched to wireless and everything worked just fine. I did NOT use the software that comes with the router just logged into the router using IE7 and confiugured it. Works great."
1,Run while you can!,"Please, stay away from this product! Drops connection even at 3 feet. Stops routing for absolutely no reason, and doesn't work even if you reset it. I had to unplug and plug it like 5 times before it worked. Run run run!"
3,"It's okay, but not great...","I really, really want to love this router. It's got the familiar, easy-to-use interface for setup which makes it fast to setup for almost anyone.When it works, it gets good distance and it's lightning speed fast. When it works.It drops the internet signal sometimes a few times per day. I either have to wait for it to come back up or reboot it; this is annoying when I'm in the middle of something.My frustration is in that Linksys has failed to fix this problem with a patch. It wasn't a cheap router and I feel like I received a sub-standard product."
5,Great Wireless Router,This router works great especially with direct connections. I noticed a definite speed gain after retiring my old wired router. The accompaning PCI card that goes with this router has serious problems. See my other reviews.
1,JUNK,This is the worst router I have owned ever and I have owned several over the past few years. My linksys G router was much more reliable and actually maintained a much stronger wireless signal than this N model. The worst part is that this router will continually drop the N wireless adapters but the G adapters stay connected. I have purchased a replacement (not linksys) already as this one is simply worthless. This is my first review of any item I have purchased on Amazon and I hate that is has to be negative but this is one useless and frustrating product. This from an engineer with 30 years experience.
1,Don't buy this router under,"Even with firmware v1.03.3 and after changed the configuration many times, my WRT300N performs worse than my old wrt54g. It performs worse on coverage and velocity."
1,The Humchback of Linksys routers....,"Hey linksys why don't you have your next model with a roof attaching dish....this is an ugly piece of junk. Why I tried it i'll never know. You think with all those anntenna this piece of garbage would give off a good signal.....nope. Linksys sucks, D-Link is a better choice, D-Link is also better then the nightmatre than is Belkin."
1,Worked great for 6 months,"With the second baby sleeping in our office, we needed a router to be able to access the internet after bedtime so we could carry on with essentials--you know, bills, work, email, Netflix.But six months after installing this router, and it set up very easily out of the box, it started having a spotty signal--some times it would show up, most times it wouldn't. Then it quit broadcasting at all. We IM'd the Linksys support people and eventually got told it was our service provider's fault (TW)--but the router delivered a fine wired connection to the very desktop I was using to IM Linksys!So, we borrowed another router from a friend, and BOOM--worked perfectly. Now I'm trying to get Linksys to go beyond their warranty to fix this stupid thing. And my guess is that I'll be buying another brand soon. What a waste of time and money. Thanks, Cisco-Linksys."
1,crappy,"very poor product, doesn't reach around the corner, moved the antenna & didn't help, also keeps disconnecting when antenna & base are 2ft appart! have to reboot more than daily, user interface is juvenile, surprised at what garbage it is, would like to return or throw away, 50ft of ethernet cable wins anyday"
1,Lasted 1 day before failing,"I prefer Linksys products over the competion and had my WRT54G finally go out on me. I picked up this as a replacement and it worked flawlessly on initial install. No issues with anything.1 day and a half later, the wireless portion of the router failed completly. No restarting, erasing of settings or flashing of the firmware would revive it. V1.1 of the router if you are interested.Big dissapointment."
2,Very Disappointing!!!!!,"I bought an WRT300N Wireless-N Broadband router and have successfully used it for a couple of months, since I have another notebook which I use within the same house but placed in another room within the same floor. When I transferred this notebook to the lower floor, I couldn't get anymore signal. I read about the WRT300N network adaptor and decided to buy it believing that it will help in getting a better range for my notebook. The installation was easy, however, after several attempts, I just gave up because I could not get any signal at all. It was no different from just using the router. I tried to get help from the technical group of Linksys but however, I haven't received any response from them. Really disappointing!"
1,Don't Buy,"this item gave horriable connections. i did the Adaptor+this router Best Value Pack, The Set-up is quick and pointless. the Connection bars we're 2 instead of the other one i got witch was 5. i would say dont use this. wait for the REAL Patents. in 2008. G i good. =D lol dont waste you're money like i did, i also returned and defected."
3,UPGRADE firmware,I upgraded the firmware to Sveasoft bit I still do not get the distance I get from G routers. But this Router never locks up and the wireless is always there.
2,Very Disappointed with the range,"This router was advertised as having 4x the range of the venerable WRT54GS router, and as I was having coverage issues after finishing the basement, I decided to give it a try.In the same location as the WRT54GS, I was getting much lower signal strength on the first floor and of course, nothing in the basement.In the end I installed this router upstairs and the old one in the basement on the same SSID, but if you are buying this product to get expanded range on an 802.11g network, don't bother."
1,Not ready for Prime Time,"My very old Linksys WRT54G went belly-up after many years of service, so I picked this router up last week looking forward to the nice range/speed increase.Instead, I enjoyed several days of headaches and hours spent on the phone with tech support.I did get the wired portion of the router to work fairly quickly, the wireless, well, it never worked well at all.My laptop got a fairly good connection for browsing, but I would regularly get dropped or disconnected from online games.The Xbox360, I never got to work (I could sign on to live, but disconnect within a minute)... I also spent an hour with Xbox live support, they gave me a few settings to try, but also said the router was unsupported. Doh!So... I returned the WRT300N and bought, yup, another WRT54G. I have everything (laptop/printer/Xbox360) running fine wirelessly. Should have read the reviews here first.Avoid this router!"
5,Linksys 3,"The product was received promptly.Installation was simple.It works as advertised, no problems.The price beat the lowest local competition."
2,Not what they say,"Easy installation with the new firmware but not big differnce as the they advertise.Pretty faster than ordinary G ,but the range is almost the same.As for Linksys technicians,they are doing their best, but limited knowledge on home use.Lets wait for a while maybe Linksys comes up with new firmware that will fix udp ports for online games.I don't think they know themselves how do it.I suggest be patient and wait."
4,Very good turn-around,"Though I had expected a Cisco-Linksys WRT300N Wireless-N Broadband Router version 1.1 from looking at the advertised picture, it was actually a Cisco-Linksys WRT300N Wireless-N Broadband Router version 1.0. I cleaned it up a little and it is performing well."
3,dkl wireless,"Had to get some help with the installation but the shipper was very apologetic about that and customer service helped get it set up; Works well and fast, we had been using a B unit before this. Seems to be a good product even though Im not very computer savy."
3,My CD Has 10 Hits Versus 8 Reported Elsewhere,I have two additional tracks on my CD:9. Waiting for a Star to Fall - Boy Meets Girl10. 65 Love Affair - Paul Davis
5,The Best One,"Fans who are looking for the best Krista Allen flick in the Emmanuelle series (and there is no other reason to buy one) need to buy this one. It is the only one that is ALL Krista ALL the time.And if you are not a Krista Allen fan yet, then you REALLY need to buy it!"
3,Not much of a story. Who cares!,"I love it when people buy movies like this and then complain about not really much of a story.If you want a story buy Fried Green Tomatoes.Krista Allen gets naked.That's you're story.If you're honest with yourself you're buying this movie to see Krista get naked and she does, alot."
3,Okay....but...,"The product does what you would expect a rough bristle broom to do. However, no matter how much I tighten the brush, the broomstick constantly comes loose."
2,Rough bristles,"This shop broom has natural bristles that will scratch your floor. Will work great outdoors as advertised. The head does not have metal threads to screw the handle into, so it will wear out quickly."
4,Does its job,"Sturdy broom, does its job well. Sheds a few bristles, but as an outdoor broom this is a non-issue for me. I would not recommend this as an indoor broom, as it doesn't seem like the bristles are fine enough to do a good job pushing around fine particles of dust and dirt. Does a great job sweeping up yard debris and leaves though."
5,Very sturdy and practical !,"We recently moved to another home where the dirt and dust are a daily hassle to conquer. This brush works great.. on the advice of friend I tried what she describes as the french way of doing our tile floors. I have some nice size rags leftover from various sheets.. towels.. things like that that I wet, ring out and put on the floor.. if I want to I pour the cleaner of my choice right on the rag and push it around with the broom. When finished I take the pile of rags.. and into the wash they go.. very ""green"" and not wasteful."
4,Used for snow and dirt dusting,My wife really wanted one instead of using the old angle broom. Good enough quality and works just fine for what it is.
2,"Good buy for fans who like the subs, bad if they love the music","I was so happy when Prince of Tennis came to America, but a little wary also. I watched the original Japanese episodes and I was deeply disappointed in the way the dub was created. However, I was happy that they'd be coming out in box sets. I recently bought Volume 2, because I couldn't find Volume 1 at the time, and I was disappointed. I was really looking forward to the great opening and closing music as WELL as the original openings/closings. The subtitles were great, original japanese, but the music? The music is what always made me excited to watch the show and I was sad to see it so butchered.It's a great buy for people who don't care about the music, but for myself..It just wasn't the same."
3,prince of tennis confussion,when i first saw this on toonami i thought it was not bad but im wondering why is it only in japanese and not in english dub is it a typing error or something. i say this because i saw this box set in dub on a different site but their wasnt none left so are they going to change that?
2,"Wow, this is bad.","NOTHING like the arcade original of the same name. But, what do you expect from an under-powered 8-bit console. Graphics are horrible, and the control is not that responsive either. I would stay far away from this NES title."
2,Poetry of Non-Essential Love,"I bought this book to read poems about parents love for their children and sacrifices of parents for their children; instead I found a collection of limericks with no taste. The title of the book is highly misleading. Do we really need to have poetry about; giving mother a bath (Bathing Mother by Mary Ann Wehler); or to My Father, Dying in a Supermarket by Wesley McNair? Poems such as; What My Mother Believed by Laura Stearns; and Admiring My Father by Thomas Smith stand out as exceptions. They offer some sparkle to an otherwise tame book. The reader is not deprived of anything if he/she chooses not to own this book."
4,excellent,"Simple, candid, concise; easy reading, easy to identify with, of interest to all. Covers most of the facts we need to know to achieve a healthy life. A must read for anyone interested in health. A great gift. Hope it is read by many. Could really save lives."
3,Pretty good,Overall a pretty good book. Obviously much of the book is dated and it covers some very basic topics. More for the novice handicapper rather than the seasoned horseplayer.
3,"A ""Dutchman"" without a Dutchman--serious problem","EMI brought out two Flying Dutchman recordings that went to the top of the list, this one under Klemperer and a later one under Karajan. Both had excellent sound, orchestral playing, and ocnducting, along with outstanding choruses (Klemperer, however, had the edge here with the masterful Wilhelm Pitz as his choral director).Unfortunately, both sets had a serious flaw, and as it happened they were opposites. Karajan's Senta is the harsh-voiced, rather fierce Slavic soprano Dunja Vejkovic, Klemperer's Dutchman is the faceless, dry-voiced workman Theo Adam. Over the years neither defect has improved, so either you listen to these classic sets and skirt around the flaws--hard to do, given how much music Senta and the Dutchman sing together--or you go elsewhere. Personally, I went to the recent Sinopoli on DG and a live performance under Sawallisch on super-budget Opera d'Oro"
3,A minority view,"I'm afraid I just don't get the enthusiasm others have for this recording. My principal problem is with Klemperer's speed, or rather the lack thereof. He's the only conductor I know who can make *everything* sound as long as Parsifal (even when the actual minutes aren't that different from other recordings). Here the Dutchman can barely sail, much less fly. I don't remember my dates well enough to know if this recording was made before or after Karajan did his best to ruin Silja's voice, but the top notes are pretty harsh here, though some of the role is nicely done. There are other recordings of this opera that have much to offer; check out the Konwitschny on Koch/Berlin with Fischer-Dieskau and Wunderlich, or the RCA with Dorati."
1,Is this a book on education or piglatin?,"This book has many strategies and models that a classroom teacher can use; and as an administrator, I have found many coaching techniques that are valuable. However, EDIT THE THING. It is just egregious that a book on education can be so riddled with errors. I am shocked and appalled. Shame on the editors!!! Or were there any editors?P.S. If the 121,233,334,221,444 errors are fixed maybe it can rate 3 or 4 stars."
4,Great atmosphere!,I grew up in the neighborhoods described by Thomas Lipinski in A Picture of Her Tombstone. His accounts of day to day life in the ethnic inner city are right on the money. Took me on a trip down memory lane. Especially enjoyed the references to the Catholic schools which I attended. A fast moving book.
4,"A good product, but not for every baby",If your baby has thin little thighs then this would probably be great for them. If they are on the chunkier side then they will probably be too tight and leave marks on their legs. The opening at the ankle and thigh are the same size which doesn't make sense to me. Shouldn't the opening at the thigh be wider?
4,A Great Camera So Far,"The only complaints I have up to now are the difficulty of learning to use all of the features, there are quite a few. Also the display screen is hard to see in really bright sunlight.The stop motion and video features are great and the standard photos seem to come out really sharp. The camera has a solid feel and is well made. Best one I've ever owned for the price."
4,Great Camera!,I bought this camera to take on a recent trip to Cancun. Got it just a day prior to leaving. This camera is easy to use and takes great pictures. I was surprised by the size. It is small and light weight. Perfect digital camera for vacations.
4,Great camara for what I paid for it...,"I bought the refurb off woot for $130, and it's been working great.Reliability: 9/10 - this thing survived hundreds of drops/abuses in my backpack; it's extremely durable.Sensitivity: 8/10 - default light settings make no-flash pictures very dark, you have to tweak the ISO, aperture, and shutter manually, then you'll get some pretty awesome pics.Size: 6/10 - the camera is pretty bulky, but that's expected with the load of features included.If you just want to take basic pics, don't spend over 150$ on a camera, it's not worth it. If you want to take professional shots, expect to blow 300$+. If you're taking professional shots with a point and shoot, well, you're not gonna be a professional for very long. For its purpose, the L85 is a great deal, but only at 130$, not at MSRP."
4,Wow! This made me really think,"I didn't know what to expect when I watched this film. I mean, a film about suicide! BUT, it is soooo much more than that. The filmmakers spend less time on the fact that there is a suicide and more on the fact of what happens when a group of people embark on a journey together, that seems like a good idea but turns out not to be. Things get complicated. People are betrayed. Lines get crossed. In the process, you learn a little about yourself. I really liked this movie a lot. I thought about it for days and days after. What would I do? Highly high recommend."
1,Not happy,I could never get the item to work. I have tried to work it several times and I don't know why it won't work. I am not satisfied.. Is it possible to send the item back?
5,great garden fun,We gave these sets for Mothers Day and thrilled our daughters. Nice quality: comfortable knee pad and very sturdy tools. They are great in pots and garden beds.nice
2,gardening,well its cute but the tools break :( arent sharp at all and the gloves do NOT help with thorns!
2,garden tool apron,A gift. I would not have chosen this garden tool set but it was the only one guaranteed to arrive by the date needed. Very expensive. I've never seen anyone work in the garden in an apron either.
2,disappointed...,I bought it for my mom as a surprise present. I was super disappointed because it was not a new product. I think it was already used before. I did not ordered used one...stains on kneeling pad and dirt on every tools handgrip.very disappointed.
5,Great product,I love this product. I used it for my little garden this summer. The tools are strong and good quality. Everything you need for a small garden.
4,fran from wiscosin,pink and some of the profits going to cancer research is good thing. Tools are good quality using them now in flower garden.The price was fair.
4,An intricate who-done-it,"Incredibly, the cover blurb discloses all but the last thirty pages! Who would write such a thing??? It completely spoils the suspense that must have been there for the original readers. Nevertheless, the book itself is well written, and the multiple points-of-view are cleverly interwoven to advance the plot, not distract from it. As you will see when you read the book, you don't really have equal access to the crucial clue, which may or may not be a violation of the unofficial mystery writers' code of ethics, but nevertheless the book is entertaining."
2,Outdated for 2009,"Though this book still has some valid points (such as think of yourself and your business as two separate entities with yourself being and employe of your business), it is completely out of date. I was re-reading this book the other day as I had it from college in 2005. It talks a lot about how digital photography is not something to worry about and talks about the internet as if few people have heard of it. This book is too old to be useful."
2,Good book lousey CD,Book is a great comprehensive business system for photographers. But try as I might the CD will not allow me to use it. Without the CD the rest is pretty useless. There is NO support so if YOU can't get it to operate you are on your own.
2,Disappointed,"First let me say the information in this book is good and informative, however, it boarders on telling people ""Don't bother, it's too hard"". Also, the disk that comes with it is for a financial program written specifically for photography. The downside is that it doesn't work on many operating systems, and the author doesn't have a date when it will updated. That would have been good tom know BEFORE I purchased it."
4,starting a business,"I like this book and find some of the tips easier to read than other books on this topic. The other book that is kind of an equivalent t to this would be ""The Business of Studio: Photography"" by Lilly. This book for me was more reader friendly, and the other had a more professional feel to it, and covers more on wedding photography.Both I think are essential for those looking for such specific literature, starting a business in photography.The Business of Studio Photography: How to Start and Run a Successful Photography Studio"
2,Not so good,This book is not so good. It just states the things which should be obvious to anybody who is getting into business. One can learn more for free by just joinging some pro forums online.
5,Love it,"We have a model that is very similar to this, and it works great. Lots of power, very easy to clean (just rinse), fine strain, and fantastic customer service (they replaced an earlier model with this one after a minor problem--no questions asked). This is a great machine."
4,Good Juicer,"The juicer is just the right size to sit on a counter, it makes good juice; first try it used lots of apples but small amount of pulp waste left. I wish it came with a juicer cook book for suggestions. The cleaning is simple once you learn how to remove the basket & side arms. We use this two - three times a week, especially on week ends."
5,Great Mini Juicer,"I bought this as a gift for my wife. She had spent some time researching for a juicer and decided on this one. Even thought it is slightly expensive, it is worth it in its performance.The minimal pulp waste is the best characteristic. We can ensure that we are getting the most benefits from the juiced vegetables and fruits."
1,BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"SDDALL has not refunded my money, and Amazon is allowing this to happen...even with all the proof I have that I sent it back!!! When I received the juicer that he said was new, it was filled with crud from fruit and no telling what else. It also had scratches all over the lid and other places! I sent the item back, and told him the condition of the juicer and he still refuses to send my money back. It has been almost two months and I have not received nada! BUYERS BEWARE SERIOUSLY!!!!"
