1,Falls short,This Bond Movie wasn't as good as the Connery one's or even the Dalton Yes I liked him. I have all the bond movies this one had a great story but by the end the story takes a back seat to the action. Maybe next time for the band films. If you like you action fast and loud by this film.
1,A truly embarrassing Bond entry.,"""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is the absolute lowpoint of the Bond series. A moronic ""plot,"" half-baked action sequences and characters that serve no purpose, this is vastly worse than even ""A View to a Kill,"" ""Moonraker"" or ""Man With the Golden Gun."" This film should never have been made. Brosnan is the weakest of the Bonds, and his entire point in making these movies seems to be having an opportunity to strike poses for two hours. The sets and direction of this movie make it seem like it isn't even taking place on Earth; there should be at least SOME semblence of reality, even in a James Bond movie. However, there is none here. A waste."
2,One of if not THE Worst Bond Movie of all Time,"Although I haven't seen every Bond movie, I've seen most of them, and so call myself a Bond fan. Now I hear ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is the worst Bond film, but I havent seen it, so I will bestow the honor on this film ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". The title itself is terrible, makes no sense, and forbodes bad things to come.You wouldn't think this is so bad by all the cool gadgets and chases, but the underlying plot, normally thrilling in other Bond films, remains utterly lacking in this one. Terri Hatcher is hot, but boring, and Bond's nemimis in this one is weird and unimaginative (he's a media mogul, ooo scary... what ever happened to SPECTRE?). It's hard to explain why this movie [is bad], it just does, and that's coming from a huge Bond fan. But don't take it from me, take it from Moby (who did do a cool rendition of the Bond theme for the film) who called it the biggest peice of (expletive) he'd ever seen. It's just that bad."
2,Even my cat would have more presence playing Bond...,"Pierce Brosnan returns for a second stint as James Bond and while his performance is clearly superior to the one he gave in Goldeneye, he still has a long way to go before he can be taken seriously as this character. The problem is, in a word, presence. Brosnan has hardly any screen presence and this makes for a highly forgettable and boring Bond. As I stated in my review of Goldeneye, Brosnan needs to lighten up a touch and not play the role as seriously. Perhaps even a little Remington would help. While TMD has loads of action and intrigue, the film is rather boring as a result of Brosnan's lackadaisical performance. Where are you Rog? We need you..."
4,Awsome Movie!,"O.K. first let's talk Pierce. Extremly handsome and a wonderful Bond. TND was an awsome action movie with more action scenes packed into it than I've seen in many Bond movies. The one thing that upset me and why I didn't give it 5 stars was because it felt more like a typical 90's action movie rather than a sauve and sexy Bond movie. It just felt like it was missing a tiny bit of the bond recipe, like a dash of pepper or lemon or something like that. I loved Michelle Yeoh, she is the best Bond girl I've scene yet. Fits in perfect at a party or a shoot out. Totally capaple of living on her own but wouldn't mind a rough British (Not to mention sexy) British agent following her around. Awsome Movie! I recomend it."
4,Close but No Cigar,"This film was good but not worth a full 5 Stars. The point of the movie was a little hard to understand. The plot was good but it was hard to follow. The film was action-packed with top-of-the-line gadgets. The BMW he gets was better than the BMW Z3 that he got in ""Goldeneye."" Buy this movie for an ""action-packed"" film that will keep you on the edge of your seat"
1,He's just not Connery.,"Although not the bummer of Bond's past flick (Golden Eye), Tomorrow just can't keep pace with the golden first films about James Bond.There were, however some fantastic moments. The gadgetry doesn't disappoint, Bond is as armed as ever. His car is the best, posessing qualities we all wish we had on our family stationwagons.I'm giving this one a one star ""Bummer"" rating. It can't hold a candle to the films of yore, nor should it."
2,Jane Bond's debut,"Tomorrow Never Dies introduces a new character in the James Bond-type tradition. Michelle Yoah (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon)does a great job as she fights, claws and kicks her way out of every scenario to fight the world against a media meglomaniac played by Jonathan Pryce.Huh? What's that? You mean this is a JAMES Bond movie? But I thought the purpose of a JAMES Bond movie was for JAMES Bond to save the world. Funny - it seems here that Ms. Yoah can handle the situation quite well. It looks like that JAMES Bond character gets in the way. My bad.I'm all for great, kick-butting female characters like Lora Croft & Alias, etc. So I think they make a sequel to this movie with the Michelle Yoah character, who completely takes over the movie. But I thought this was a JAMES Bond movie. Silly me.As a new debut for a female JANE Bond, this movie gets 4 stars.As a JAMES Bond flick, it's useless.Goldeneye was 100 times better."
2,Even the girls weren't hot,"Firstly, allow me to say that I love the video game. That being established, I can go on to write the rest of this review. Granted, I'm probably not the most qualified person to be writing this as I actually fell asleep in the theatre . . . even with THX. I actually find histology more engaging than I found this movie, which is pretty amazing considering how damn boring histology is. The funny thing is that when I woke up, realizing the inappropriatness of drooling in a public place, I hadn't missed a thing. In a nutshell, James Bond has a buch of gadgets, he blows stuff up, drinks some martinis, has some sex and then saves the day. Actually, even the sex was bad. How can anyone do a sex scene without nudity? I mean without nudity, all you've really got is weird sounds. If this review helps one person to not watch this movie, I will feel satisfied. The only reason this movie didn't get one star was because that one star is reserved for THE worst movie ever made - Michael."
3,Send In The What?,"I love all of the Bond movies, but in order to enjoy this one you have to suspend belief to a greater degree than usual. Why? Quite simply because we are supposed to believe that a media mogul will risk starting World War III just to grab a few headlines.Even more ludicrous than that is the statement made at the beginning of the film when it appears that the Chinese have sunk a British warship, and a bright spark exclaims, ""Send in the Navy!"" Send in the what? I consider myself to be a fiercely patriotic, flag-waving Brit, but Britain now has more Admirals than ships, and the mere suggestion that Britain would single-handedly take on the might of China is laughable.Still, Bond is Bond. Suspend your belief system and enjoy the action - three stars for the action, and the loss of two stars for the ridiculous plot."
3,Tomorrow Never Dies (Special Edition) dies dull death,"As much as Pierce Brosnan is a favorite actor, pairing him with Terri Hatcher was not a great choice. Watch it for Jonathon Pryce, who is brilliant as the villian, and Dame Judy Dench as the perfect M."
4,Espionage and Adventure,"The James Bond character brings another 007 thriller to the screen. You know he is going to win; but, getting there is half the fun. A ruthless tycon wants to disestablish the world's economy to bring the opposing superpowers to their knees so that he can make money. James Bond steps in to prevent WW III from breaking out. Of course, you have to have the beautiful women populating the film too; they add to the great color and variety of the background."
4,Great as there is Michelle Yeoh,"This show is another typical Bond shows where you will get to see cool gadgets. However, different this time is the Bond girl. An Asian bond girl that kiss ... . Michelle Yeoh really adds colours to this show. Overall, quite a nice and exciting show."
5,A BOND- RIDE ALL THE WAY,"Synopsis:007 goes up against Eliot Carver, a Media mogul who wants to start WW3 to boostthe ratings of his network empire by broadcasting it.Review:This James Bond flick has all the action gadgets bad guys and shootouts you expect from007.Pierce Brosnan as always the suave spy. But the villain played by Jonathan Prycesteals the show."
4,"Buy the SPECIAL EDITION, not this one!","It has more features and a better design to the menus. One of the best DVDs yet. The movie is also an excellent Bond adventure, having all the classic things we expect and even more. Brosnan even further cements his take on 007."
4,A great Bond film,"This is a brilliant film, which I think is the best Bond film for a long time. It starts of brilliantly, and only deterioates towards the end when the violence becomes a little too heavy. At the end of the Cold War, I thought scripts for Bond would dry up, but they keep on coming."
5,Who needs a Cold War?,"Apparently not Bond. When I first bought this IBM computer with DVD-ROM my friends scoffed, saying ""What do you need a DVD-ROM for?"" I haven't yet answered, nor do I plan to. The Pentium II 350 performed flawlessly, and the extras were to die for! I especially liked the optional commentary and the including of the original movie trailers. Buy it! Bond never has, and probably never will."
3,Bond is marred by DVD extras,"The movie is fine. And there's probably a lot more on this DVD than almost any mainstream release. But there is one truly annoying feature. There is an alternate storyboard feature with this DVD. And suddenly there's this little drawing above the wide screen version of the film, which means you can click to see how it was alternately story boarded. Well Whoopdee Doo! This becomes truly annoying. Like watching television when both the network and the local station decide to superimpose their logos and you've got a storm coming to town. The other features make it worthwhile to purchase this special edition. But hopefully future ""producers"" will learn that this particular feature is not something a viewer wants ""always on"". It might be nice to use when reviewing commentary tracks etc. But as part of the normal viewing screen. . .it's terrible."
5,"Classic Bond story, with excellent transfer to DVD","The sound and video quality of the DVD are exceptional. In terms of technical quality, it's not Fifth Element or Starship Troopers, but it's very, very close."
3,where's the plot?,"Pierce Brosnan seems more comfortable in his second go at playing everyone's favorite spy. The problem is that the plot, while including all the time-honored James Bond movie formulae (ie. gadgets, nasty villains, exotic locals etc.) still leaves the viewer feeling a trifle confused. Great chase scenes, mulitiple explosions and numerous product endorsements still do not a good movie make.Perhaps I'm being too cynical. The movie was fast paced and entertaining, but hardly memorable. Still, a good spy thriller does not need every second to be filled with frenetic action. Often, a slow, methodical build-up can be just as menacing and effective. From Russia With Love, and North By Northwest are both good examples; just enough action to keep the pace going, while not intruding on plot and character development. TND races from actions scene to action scene, trying desperatley to follow the plot. And it leaves the viewer feeling lost."

3,Enjoyable,"A pretty good Bond flick with a good villan. The action sequinces arn't as good as Goldeneye. to be honest their isn't anything in this film that wasn't better in Goldeneye.Brosnan gives a good performance as Bond again and the character Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh, Police Story 3) is one of the best Bond girls. There are plenty of gadgets as well as a new BMW. There are some good shots on the streets of Saigon where a over the top Motor cycle chase happens.Definatly not one of the best Bond films but not too bad."
2,Wasted potential,"Well, here it is, finally a DVD Bond movie with decent extra features. It's just a shame that it had to be Tomorrow Never Dies, definately the weakest of the three Brosnan Bond movies. Goldeneye and The World Is Not Enough are classic Bond flicks and would be perfectly suited to DVDs capabilities, but Tomorrow Never Dies is just an average, mindless action adventure with a ludicrous storyline that Mike Myers could use for Austin Powers Three (stolen nuclear missiles sound at all familiar?).The stunts and effects in this film are, admittedly very impressive, and are therefore worth checking out on DVD, but there's no need for a special edition, just buy the cheaper normal edition, unless you are dying to know how on earth they drove that car without a driver. Which I am not."
2,The ultimate advertising machine,"The movie was an excellent commercial for BMW. True, there were a few action scenes and explosions between the shots of racing beemer cars and bikes. But they were a bit distracting. It would have been better to just show the 740i and the motorcycle without any of that fluff. The car is beautiful and the bike is awesome. As far as Bond movies go, the girls were..... okay and Pierce Brosnan is pretty good but he was better in Goldeneye which is a better movie anyway (Beemer gets the Z3 advertised in that one)."
1,Worst Bond movie of them all.,"I don't want to trash Brosnan; in many ways he's the ultimate Bond(though some 10 years too late), but this film is without a doubt the worst 007 movie in history. Nothing against the cast; they do what they can, but the thing that I never thought could take place in a Bond movie, happens here endlessly. -Boredom!. It began with ""Goldeneye"", and it's gotten worse. James Bond movies have started to look like a big-scale Dolph Lundgren action-flick, or something. Where's the imagination of the Moore-era !?. Where are the interesting characters ?. Where's the good story ?. They've become just another big-budget ""blow 'em up""-actioner. Boring!. They're too serious, too dark, running from one desperate explotion to the next, lacking any kind of humour or memorable scenes. It's the end of 007, I'm afraid. You may resign now, ""Mr.Bore""."
5,great movie,"I actually bought this movie from Target for $9.99, not the $26 + it's being sold for online. It's a great movie with lots of action and suspense. A must have for James Bond fans."
3,Better Bond,Bond gets better with bluray - was more enjoyable this time round - feasted on the better visuals! - bravo!
5,Tomorrow Never Dies.,"I think Pierce Brosnan is a very good James Bond. ""Bond, James Bond"". I also liked Terry Hatcher, although she had a very small part and was absolutely crazy about Michele Yeoh. The rest of the cast was excellent, like Judy Dench ""Judy Judy Judy"" . Jonathan Pryce is a good actor, but not my cup of tea."
4,True To Bond,"When you watch a Bond movie you want and expect certain elementsThis movie delivers what us Bond fans want.Great fun, cleaver, sarcastic and pure Bond."
2,Review of Cave of the Moving Shadows,I thought the book moved very slowly and was kind of boring. It didn't give too much information about the characters. I would not recommend this book to many people.
1,maxiplayer,The tension required to hold the cards was more than my arthritis permitted. I cut a 3/32 inch wide slot in a one inch square by 8 inch long pine board. The cards lay in place without any tension and thus solved the problem that the purchased player could not solve.
3,The Moodies March Ever Onward,"Having most if their first albums, I got this just to share with a friend and found that it had some nice tunes on it. Mostly recognizable themes, but sufficiently musical enough that I wasn't disappointed with my purchase. The friend liked it too."
4,Moody Pops,"With all the great work on the first 5 albums, this leaves a bit to be desired. The popish songs on this album make it worth buying mostly because easy listening stations will play more songs from this album than any other Moody album."
4,A long distance voyage indeed,"Long Distance Voyager is an album has held up remarkably well over time. The Moody Blues update their classical and rock sound just slightly with synths and marvelous producing to create a whirl of orchestral sounds and pop. ""Gemeni Dream"" and ""The Voice"" are certainly staples of classic rock, but the reflective ""Talking Out Of Turn"" and the counterpart of ""Nervous"" shouldn't be over looked. ""In My World"" is a ballad with muscle that builds from from solo guitar to strings and that Moody chorale without ever getting wimpy. Highly entertaining album."
4,Uneven but still original,"Only the Moody Blues could come up with a different sound but is still original and enjoyable. Talking out of turn is my favorite on this album. The first three songs represent by far the strongest songs on the album and there were some forgettable pieces such as ""22,000 days"". Even so, I recommend this album/cd.I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com"
3,Long Distance Voyager,Bit of a transition between the original cosmic stuff and the more rounded melodies of later years. As a result it falls between two stools and will not appeal to everyone.
3,"Moody Blues ""comeback"" album is still typical","The Moody Blues formula held true on their 1981 ""comeback"" album. Take a few good songs, in this case the excellent ""The Voice,"" ""Talking Out of Turn,"" and ""Gemeni Dream"" and surround them with a lot of forgettable filler material. By the time you get to the closing track ""Veteran Cosmic Rocker,"" your patience is about at an end. Nevertheless, those first three songs almost redeem the whole album."
4,Fine Moodies,"The worst of the Moody Blues catalogue is better than anything most other bands ever get to make. While this isn't their absolute best, it is indeed a fine album. It only suffers by comparison to their best & from anybody else would be considered a masterpiece. I personally like this album better than either Favour or Sojurn from the ""Core 7"". This is, in my opinion, the best of the post Octave recordings & a worthy addition to your collection. While this is the best sounding CD available, if you can find it & want the best sounding version I would suggest the German or Japan vinyl pressing."
4,shifty shifter,Install was Not a walk in the park like it seemed it would be. Operation takes some getting use to. Not super smooth and kinda quirky but does what it is suppose too.
5,My 2 year old loves this doll,"I had a Cabbage Patch as a child and I felt that my little girl should have one too. I got it for her 1st christmas but she didn't start playing with it until she turns 2. Now she carries it everywhere and calls it ""Baby"""
4,Just one thing ...,"This base makes the tastiest soup. I'm so glad I found it!But although it is fat free, lower sodium, and free of MSG, why the corn syrup?!?Disappointing."
4,Ham base,Very tasty. I put it in my pot of crock pot beans and it gave them a great flavor. I would advise anyone to use it.
1,Leaves a scum layer,When I used this Ham Base to make soup it left a scum layer that did not dissolve and I had to try and skim it off the soup. I tried contacting the company twice before leaving this review and they never responded. Don't waste your money on this product.
5,Best Ham Base Ever!,"Ham base is not always available in stores, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. I use my bases alot and my family loves the extra flavor."
1,jar leaking ham juice on arrival. amazon won't replace...just refund.,thanks for ruining our christmas ham gravy. seal not broke and lid tight BUT LEAKING VERY BADLY. TOO EXPENSIVE TO BE TREATED LIKE THIS.
2,Disappointed,When this product arrived I opened the box and it smelled like the product andthe jar was all greasy.I could not tell if was from the jar itself or if itcam from a case that had a broken jar in it.It looked like it was sealed butit did not pop when I opened it.This does not make me comfortable with using it.Need I say more.Do you want a satisfied customer? Or not.
2,Good Product,"I bought this item, and when it arrived, the lid was loose on it, even tho it still had the plastic around the lid of the jar. The jar was greasy and you could tell that it had been leaking out of the jar."
3,A Little Overpowering,"I bought this to season beans, as it is hard to find any ham flavoring. It seems to be good quality, but has a very, very potent smoke flavor that overpowers everything. I won'd be buying this again."
3,Ham Bouillon,"Despite the jar tampering seals, our jar of ham base arrived open and messy oils leaked within the packaging (also requires refrigeration once ""opened"" - not good) However, we do like the product itself, flavor choices & lack of MSG compared to other competing brands. Wish this particular flavor was sold in more stores vs. online."
4,great resource,"This book has helped me find a number of great rides. My only negative comment would be that I would have liked more detailed maps. Given the difficulty of packing all of them into a single book, perhaps that is unreasonable."
3,Well...,"...it is a good Stones live record,worth the price. But I still prefer Ya-Ya's,Flashpoint and Stripped (haven't heard Live Licks yet).But if you are a true fan,get it!It is double!"
5,love you live,"A previous review has the Stones performing at a club in Montreal.The club was the EL Macombo in Toronto, Canada.They performed at the club prior to performing thier stadium show in Toronto.Anyone who knows this club will tell you this is where rock bands in Toronto played during those years, something like the Fillmore clubs in San Francisco and Philly.This is the Stones at there best, a must have cd with a raw sound that does not sound contrived, get it and listen to the EL Macombo side you will love it."
3,Good but not great...,"After purchasing Flashpoint and Get yer ya yas out, I made the trip to my local CD store and picked up Love You Live and compared to the other 2, I was kind of disappointed. Sure, this isn't a bad live album, its pretty decent but outside of great renditions of ""Sympathy For The Devil"", ""Star Star"", and ""Jumping Jack Flash"", there isn't much to write home about here."
2,Ron Wood Is NOT Mick Taylor,"Five words should suffice: GET YER YA YAS OUT. The El Mocambo cuts are the only reason to justify this CD - and, PLEASE no more ""this was when Keef was busted for heroin."" That is SO ""last century."""
1,"""Give Mah Thuh Hahkay Tawk Blahs""","How can anyone like a live band where the lead singer slurs words like Jagger did on this record? I thought that this was the worst live album I'd ever heard when I was 16 and my feeling still hasn't changed. Let's face it, the Stones pretty much stink live, and always have. The only time that they were remotely decent was when Brian Jones played and wasn't too inebriated."
1,Stones Are Awful Live,"Save for Charlie Watts, the Stones are horrible musicians who can't play live. It especially shows on this set, a recording made when Richards was in the midst of a serious herion addiction, and when Ronnie Wood was a major league boozer.Jagger mumbles most of the lyrics. There are no background vocals. Keith was probably too stoned to remember the words to the songs.Keep your money and buy the studio recordings."
5,One of the best!,A must for a new or old Stones fan. Contains probably the best version of Brown Sugar. Buy it!
3,Not the Best Live Album from the Stones.,"I bought this album years ago when it came out. The sound quality was fairly bad to poor. The songs are great, but still with this new remastered set the sound is still poor, if you are going to get any Stones live CD's get the ""Stripped"" album, it sounds great and the selection of tunes spans the entire career of the Stones, with a couple of rare ""Exile on Main Street"" songs."
3,"Not their best, but better than a lot of other bands","This live album chronicles the Stones at probably the low point of their career. Ron Wood was still becoming integrated in the band, Keith Richards was hitting rock bottom, and Mick Jagger was trying to keep the band together. The song tempos give the listener an idea of what kind of substances the players must have been ingesting before, after, and even during the shows. Having said that, this is a better live album than a lot that I have heard. The only double live album the Rolling Stones have done (all of their live albums should have been doubles!)"
4,The 4th Live Album,"Love You Live was originally released Sep 23, 1977. It was recorded at Maple Leaf Gardens, Toronto (6-17-75), Earl's Court, London (5-21/26-76), Les Abattoirs, Paris (6-5/7-76), and the El Mocambo Club, Toronto (3-4/5-76).Interesting notes include:.....The cover is by Andy Warhol.....photos of the Stones biting each other.....Margaret Trudeau, wife of Canadian Prime Minister Piere Trudeau, was present at the Toronto shows and made international headlines when she was accused of partying with the Stones, which was especially scandalous since Keith had been arrested for heroin trafficking on Feb 27th after he arrived in town for the El Mocambo Club shows.This information comes from ""It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones"" by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection."
5,"The best live album of all-time, bar none.","This is the one Stones album to have. It is the best live album in the history of mankind. The El Macambo (sp?) side is the absolute pinnacle of the Stones. ""Mannish Boy,"" ""Crackin Up,"" ""Little Red Rooster"" and ""Round and Round."" If you don't like this CD, you don't like Rock and Roll. I can't believe they've re-released it! I had to pay $75 for it thru classifieds when it was out of print. Never regretted it, though."
5,Fantastic,"Fantastic live album of the Stones. The songs are partially even better than the corresponding studio takes, and that may mean something. My favorite songs on this album are ""Honky Tonk Woman"", ""Tumbling Dice"", ""It's Only Rock'n'Roll"", ""Brown Sugar"" and ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"". My favorite concert of the Rolling Stones however is the one on the video ""The Rolling Stones Live At The Max"" of their Steel Wheels tour."
4,Sentimental value,"Many of the reviews of Love You Live at the time of its release praised the El Mocambo set of 4 songs, which are very good, but the rest of the album, recorded live in Paris, is excellent as well. For those partial to Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out, Love You Live suffers by comparison, yet the opening numbers especially hold up well. Certainly the 1969 outfit was a lot tighter, but there is a lot of energy in If You Can't Rock Me and Star Star, as well as superb workouts on Fingerprint File and You Can't Always Get What You Want. Sympathy For the Devil is an acquired taste on this version, but I've grown to love it. The last word on this live album has to go to Charlie Watts, who is absolutely at his peak here. I love this album, call it sentimental value, but it works. The Still Life collection of the 1981 tour is a big dropoff by comparison, that sounds very hurried and ragged."
4,great for alaskans,"great product. well built. provides exactly what they say it does and more. Holds my 700 lbs plus four wheeler on top with no problem. Drains weird and is sometimes hard to fully drain, but it works and helps with traction well."
4,Good Idea,Very Simple. Like the product so far. Seems to add enough weight to help with the tires slipping. The only issue is securing it to the truck. The ties attach to the side and not the end of the pad. So far it hasn't slipped or moved when driving.
3,Some potential Problems,"First of all, I think that most people shut off their water supply outdoors to prevent frost damage. So where do you hook it up? The kitchen? Then after you fill this, wouldn't it freeze and become a projectile also? I think you might be better served just getting snow tires."
4,Great product!,"I bought one of these for my husband's truck because they CAN'T fly anywhere on impact. I'm all about the safety. In response to J. E. Kiehn's review, I'm not certain if he knows exactly how much force is required to break a sandbag, therefore ""dissipating"" it's energy, but after working in the ER for a number of years and seeing a few ""sandbags meet craniums"", I can state categorically and for the record, the cranium always loses. The sandbag always comes out looking better. That's why the guy who invented this product is a genius!Get rid of any potential projectiles from the back of your truck and pick up a ShurTrax. It does what it advertises and easier on the truck bed than sand or salt bags. Have had ours for 3 months and no leaks despite other cargo!"
2,I've grown sence then,"I remember when I saw venard at a church musical 30 years ago. I had such a good time listening to his music, I thought it be refreshing to hear again."
3,little steps,"I saw a revealing interview with ""Johnny Cougar"" on an Australian TV variety program back in '79/80. After performing ""I Need A Lover"" - a big hit down under - Cougar was asked about his ambitions.His reply was unusually honest for commercial TV, saying that he was still trying to ""find"" his voice and was unsure about his current direction. This album represents where Cougar was at back then, and is a snapshot of a certain time. He would go on to develop and hone his instincts in later releases but this is a fair starting point.By the way: this album is not his debut - that ""honour"" belongs to John's 1976 album ""Chestnut Street Incident"", followed by ""The Kid Inside""."
2,A decent effort,"""Night dancing"" and ""Do you think that's fair?"" gives us a hint of what to come later on, when John Cougar Mellencamp released his strongest album ever by the name of ""Lonesome jubilee"". But this album was released many years earlier while he still used to call himself John Cougar and it's not a great effort, except for the two mentioned songs. I guess a dedicated fan will find pleasure in this album but the casual listener should go for ""Lonesome jubilee"" or ""Scarecrow""."
2,Not very humourous,"The Humour of Sex is a mistitled book. It's more like a collection of quotations in general on sexuality. For instance, I didn't find anything particularly smirk-worthy in the misogynistic snippet from Malleus Maleficarum.Granted, there were some funny bits, but all in all, it looks more like the editors rummaged through their old books and movies and found anything they could that had to do with prurience or gender.(...)"
3,Pretty Good but you can tell JB didn't have His Own bag yet,heard this Set&I Know JB started out Under Little Richard&it shows in many spots here.He was trying to fit in&you know right there that James Brown we all have grown up on didn't fit into anyone else's bag or Vibe.you can Hear James Brown&Crew finding there way here but it's very Rough On Point to what shall come a few years later.still worth peaking into.
4,Hilarious book full of practical advice,"This is a humorous book full of wisdom from many years of living and practicing medicine. Dr. Peck was my Mom's town doctor in Tooele, UT and I'd heard lots of stories about him. I've read three of his books and they are all excellent."
5,Long Lost Book,"I was in embalming school 45 years ago. At that time we used a text book entitled ""The Principles and Practices of Embalming"". I recently had need to look up some history of embalming and I remember reading about it in that book. I went on line to Amazon and sure enough there were a few copies available. I ordered one and had it in a couple days. It is in almost perfect condition and I was able to locate all the history information I needed. Thank you"
3,This is the standard tome --,"5th Ed. seems to be the latest edition, 1991. This is pretty much the standard work for mortuary practices, teaching and reference. If it's like any other technology, methods and materials have changed since the publication of this work in 1975. Might be interesting as an historical work."
2,NICE TRY..BUT NO CIGAR,"Warners and Rhino go out of their way to give us an extended version of ""Dainty June and Her Farmboys"", yet they cheat us and don't include the complete version of Louise's Strip Routine? I'll stick to my DVD."
4,Good soundtrack to a good movie,"The glorious Styne/Sondheim score is left virtually intact and well-played by the Warner Bros.Orchestra under the spirited direction of Frank Perkins.The cast performs surprisingly wellfor a bunch of mostly nonsingers,and Lisa Kirk does a wonderful job of dubbing Rosalind Russell(who herself is good on the threebonus tracks).The highlights are ""If Mama Was Married"",both versions of ""Rose's Turn"",and especially the hilarious ""You Gotta Get A Gimmick"".This is an hour of very enjoyable listening."
5,LIZA KIRK AND ROSALINDA RUSSELL COME UP ROSES,"GYPSY was brought to the screen with enough fidelity to maintain the original's quality and flavour, but given sufficient cinematic fair to work purely as film. I'm old enough to have seen all the Broadway Roses and they were all wonderful. But when I'm at home and in the mood to listen to a Gypsy recording - I almost alway choose the Warner Brother's soundtrack recording. (now a fine CD.) Liza Kirk seem to have the vocal energy to make every Rose song a winner. Frank P. Perkin""s Oscar nominated scoring and adaptation makes for an exciting orchestral accompaniment. P.S. Favorite Broadway Rose - Lansbury"
3,"Mostly A Book of Endgame Puzzles, Not Theory","Practical Chess Endings is a compilation of three-hundred end game positions. Chernev spends a page on each position discussing the winning tactics, often from unexpected lines of attack. The book is divided into sections containing games that involve only pawns, focus on knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and a variety of pieces. Chernev utilizes very old style chess notation that will take some getting used to.I was slightly disappointed that very little theory was discussed other than minor comments on some of the moves. The book would have been much more complete had Chernev spent time discussing theory and then showing is application; instead the book dives right into end games on page two.This book is best served as practice, offering considerable repetition for those seeking to practice end game study. I recommend this book only to those seeking to practice positions, not for those looking for a discussion on endgame theory."
1,Practical Chess Endings,"Practical Chess EndingsIt's been one month since I placed my order and I still haven't received my book, so I can't give it a better rating"
5,Unbelievable!,"It is very difficult to believe this is a first book by this author. It flows incredibly well and is obvious this author has done his homework! The only reason i bought this book was to help a friend and boy am I glad I did! I am a huge fan of ongoing character novels in the genre of Patricia Cornwell, Kay Hooper, Clive Cussler, etc and there is no doubt in my mind if this author keeps writing at this caliber that he will take his place among the best ongoing character writers in the business! Well done Jim and when is the next one?"
3,The New Controversy,"This book though written a few years ago strikes at the heart of today's controversies in America's school system. Is our system fair? According to Jonathon Kozol it's not even close! The schools described by him in different cities across America are heartbreaking in their bleaknness and terrifying in their hopelessness. Kozol paints a portrait of the new American landscape where people with wealth distance themselves from the problem and insulate their children from all poverty. One has to wonder what happened to all the civil rights activists. Did they all turn yuppie? This is the new cause in America. How do we get our schools more equal. Can money save them? Can more federal government control save our school system? This is a great book for people who care about our education system. Mark Cooley, 2nd year Education Major,Macon State College"
5,The best book I have read in a year,"This book is somewaht like a textbook in it's approach. However it's better than any textbook I have ever read. I talked about it to many people at work and even bought another copy for a family memeber who is an educator.I knew there were glaring disparities in the quality of education across the United States, but this book is dead-on. It will definitely open your eyes to what's going on in our educational system. It will reveal to you, in no uncertain terms, why the rich continue to get richer and the poor will get poorer. Sadly it's going to remain that way or get even worse until we do something about the funding of innercity schools.What we are doing to the children in the poor neighborhoods is down right criminal."
5,where have our school systems gone wrong?,"This book is a must-read for anyone with children in ourpublic school systems. Kozol has extensively researched thegood, the bad, and the ugly of public schools, and has writtena shocking report on the inequalities rampant in the system.He paints a picture of an educational white elephant... topheavy with gimmicks and gadgets in the ""privileged"" schools,and replete with falling ceilings and no locker rooms in thepoorer schools. Perhaps this book will prompt you to check morethoroughly into your local schools, and attempt to right whatis wrong."
3,The New Contraversy,"This book though written a few years ago strikes at the heart of today's contraversies in America's school system. Is our system fair? According to Jonathon Kozol it's not even close! The schools described by him in different cities across America are heartbreaking in their bleaknness and terrifying in their hopelessness. Kozol paints a portrait of the new American landscape where people with wealth distance themselves from the problem and insulate their children from all poverty. One has to wonder what happened to all the civil rights activists. Did they all turn yuppie? This is the new cause in America. How do we get our schools more equal. Can money save them? Can more federal government control save our school system? This is a great book for people who care about our education system. Mark Cooley, 2nd year Education Major,Macon State College"
4,Savage Inequalities based on property tax,"According to Jonathan Kozol, ""Most public schools in the United States depend for their initial funding on a tax on local property. There are also state and federal funding sources, and we will discuss them later, but the property tax is the decisive force in shaping inequality."" Kozol's argument is that although these are public schools the funding is unequal. Kozol: ""Unless we have the wealth to pay for private education, we are compelled by law to go to public school--and to the public school in our district. Thus the state, by requiring attendance but refusing to require equity, effectively requires inequality."" Racism and classism is probably a major factor in keeping this local taxation and funding of school districts unequal. The wealthy have consistently opposed efforts to reform this inequality."
3,Unequal Schools in America,"Kozol's book presents a world of horrible inequality among America's school children. He presents to the reader schools that are horrifying because they are poorly funded. The majority of students in these insufficient schools are poor and nonwhite. I didn't know the inquality that existed in our school system until I read this book. It was saddening to read about children with no books, barely a classroom, no heating or cooling systems, and teachers that are grossly underpaid and do not care about their students who go to school just down the street from children who have schools with every possible extra. The only difference between these children is the color of their skin and the size of their parents pocketbooks. It is truly disgusting. I hope that America is trying to fix our school system so every child can receive the wonderful, fair educaiton that they deserve."
5,"Powerful, a must read!!","This was an awesome book! As a future educator of America I highly recommend this book. After reading this book I felt awakened to the realities of our education system. I knew it was flawed before, but I wouldn't have guessed it was this bad. I have placed this book on my list of ten greatest books I have read. Awesome!!"
2,Incredibly misleading,"The basic theory of this book is that America's poor urban schools are scandalously underfunded. And if the only thing I knew about this subject was the heart rending examples he digs up, I would believe it.But Kozol's examples are only a small slice of American reality. For every urban school system outspent by its suburban peers, there is another that does not. The most extreme example is the Kansas City, Missouri system which due to a school desegregation order spends twice as much per pupil as any other Missouri school, with results that have not significantly improved since the spending spree began. And nationally, the average urban school spends about as much per pupil as other schools. Because Kozol mostly ignores these facts, his selective description of the most underfunded schools is misleading.A good book could be written about American urban schools, but this ain't it."
4,America's Schools,"Kozol's book is heart wrenching and very informative. It depicts the conditions of America's public schools. From the ghetto schools of East St. Louis to the ritzy schools in the suburbs of New York. The book discusses many issues like why urban schools are so poor, why the kids that attend those schools have a higher dropout rate than kids who go to school in the suburbs, the racial segregation between schools, and many other important issues. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about any of these issues. I think that Kozol does a wonderful job at explaining both sides of the spectrum. He does a fine job at supporting his argument. And he is also a very credible author. A lot of the facts and the statistics in the book still hold true today. A very fun and sometimes sad read."
5,Must Read,"Kozol's Savage Inequalities paints a frightening picture of urban schools in the United States. He describes schools that are overcrowded, dilapidated, and flooded with sewage. He asks why we allow our children to go to schools in conditions where none of us would choose to work. He deeply explores the issue of inequality in funding. While he does suggest equalizing funding, he is careful to mention that the problems facing schools are complex and require innovative solutions. I know many teachers have read this book, but we need policymakers and elected officials to read it as well."
5,Very good!!!!!,This book is very good. Very informative and kind of a tear-jerker. It is interesting and makes you think... Great book for anyone thinking about teaching.
4,I'm outraged!!!,"Jonathan Kozol has written a stinging and well deservedcritique of the American education system. Kozol's book demonstrateshow the poorest children in America are being cheated out of opportunities that should be given to all the citizens of this country, not just the wealthy. This book is a ""must read"" for anyone involved in public education."
2,Info is Out of Date,"I read the book as a class assignment, and found the contents to be biased and out of date. I contacted the schools in question, and found that during the past 20 years, changes have taken place for the better.Also, some of the original fact-finding lacked details from some officials of the times - especially since I was growing up in Boston at the time of his writing, and I did not view things the same at all - also, too much use of the word ""Ghetto"". I was a kid from the projects, got kicked out of one high school, stayed back my senior year in the next, did not get any proper guidance then. Now I am retired from Govt., working as a high school sub.teacher, with a Master's Degree. My entire class had issues with the author's writings. Too bad..."
1,Could you deliver this product any slower?,"Ordered 8 copies of this book on 12/27/12. On 1/23/13, the books still have not shipped. During online chat wirh Amazon rep, the rep had no answer to why this shipment is delayed. No help at all. Changed shipping speed last week to Standard from free Prime shipping. Books still have not shipped, nor is there any information as to when or why the books are delayed. Looks like it is time to find another company for our business."
2,"Savage Inequalities, a real eye closer","This book, wasn't as horrible as my title may lead you to believe, but nonethelesss it put me to sleep. Though it is well written, the content becomes repetitive after awhile. After you read it, you tend to feel that if you ever hear another statistic about the quality of America's schools, you will vomit. This was my first experience of a book by Kozol, and I must say that it turned me off from any other book by him. I simply found this one to be completely boring. He goes to a school, interviews a few people, leaves, and writes about 20 pages worth of statistics. Completely boring. Nobody ever remembers statistics, they remember the story...so if he could have organized the book in a different way it would have been more interesting for the reader, and thus opening their eyes to the world that america's children have to face through education."
4,Excellent but parts are outdated,"I absolutely love this book-- I recently moved to NYC, and this book is by far the best at introducing me to the parts of the city that go beyond tourist-ville.The only problem-- it was published in 2002, and it's high time for an updated version. I went out with the book today, and two of the places had new addresses and one had disappeared altogether. Yes, I should have confirmed ahead of time, but it was still annoying.Still worth the buy-- just make sure you look up any establishments before making extra efforts to go there!"
3,I just can't get past the lack of aesthetics...,"I was soooo looking forward to getting this book - but I have to honestly say that the layout is so utterly boring that I just can't get past it. The book is full of beige, beige, and more beige (other than the black on white text that is).For an individual that is ""directionally-challenged"", I would have difficulty locating where I'm supposed to be in the city based strictly upon written instruction. Plus, frankly, I love to look at the beautiful photography that can be found in some guidebooks (and some imagery would help determine if a particular walking tour was a good fit to the reader). I really think if the layout were made more appealing that more people would get into this book."
1,Useless file,"Well it didn't work on any of the 10 dogs I have. I did better with a cheap pressed paper sand file. So go to WalMart or your favorite grocery store and buy a pack of those or check to see if they have a real good people file that will work on your dogs, if that is what you bought this file for. I seldom give bad ratings but I want to save other people's time and money on this item."
1,"doesn't work, try the product I recommend below","I trim my bichons nails about once a month, he spends most of his time indoors and therefore even after cutting his nails with the small nail clipper they aren't smooth enough and he ends up scratching my little stepsons skin. Safari Professional Pet Nail TrimmerSafari Professional Pet Nail Trimmer, Small/Medium, Small/Medium I bought a nail file made for dogs Pet Nail File but disappointingly it didn't remove the spurs and rough edges that remained.Professional Nail Files, Black 100/180- This nail file is perfect for the job, and it cost much less. Hope this helps ."
5,Could Not Put It Down,"This exciting mystery keeps your interest from the first page. The characters are well-developed . The plot has interesting twist and turns. But what will keep your interest is the author's descriptive passages. His love of language makes paragraghs read like poetry. You will get lost in his words. I hope this is just the first of many novels from this new author. I look forward to reading more and more. I have shared this ""first novel"" with many of my friends and they also loved it!"
2,Mozart Violin Sonatas by Mutter,A beautiful rendition of the Mozart violin sonatas by two excellent performers! It is a total shame and extremely disturbing to view the poor choice of camera angles with rapid shift of images. It's a total waste of money. I could enjoy the same performance on CD and do away with the dizziness.
5,Excellent movie soundtrack....,The soundtrack of this movie is one of the best I have heard in years.The musical score by Hans Zimmer is superb.Would recommend this CD to anyone who has seen the KIng Arthur movie.
3,King Arthur,"Loved the music while watching the film but it was slightly disappointing when I heard it apart from the film. Still worth listening to, though."
5,King Arthur Original Soundtrack,"The musical score is very relaxing yet exhilarating at times, a complete soundtrack. A must for anyone who enjoys original musical scores."
4,Where's the Requiem??,"I love this CD and play it a lot,but,.I was highly disappointed when there was no Requiem for a Dream on it.That was the one reason I wanted the CD.I cant find Hans Zimmer's version of it anywhere,in MP3s either. Still,it is a really good CD!"
5,The Bomb,"If you heard his last bachata cd, you'll love this new one. This is his best ever if you are a bachata lover."
4,remote receiver NP01MR for your PC to operate your slide show,"I took the NP01MR receiver out of the package, plugged it into the laptop (a PC will also work just fine). I pulled up my power point slide show and flipped through the slides from the front of the room. what more do you want? the view angle is 60 degrees, so you have to put the PC/laptop near where you will be speaking, but you do not have to touch it, just use the remote. You may also navigate around on the PC and select either the left or right mouse buttons. that feature also works well."
2,Ordered MERV 11 rated filter but received MERV 8,"I ordered this item (MERV 11) and just received MERV 8 rated filters. I contacted this seller but the seller has not responded.I suggest that if you are planning on ordering this filter from this seller, make sure that you receive the same rated filter. MERV 8 is cheaper than MERV 11 and not as efficient."
5,HP printable DVDs,"Excellent quality with bright white finish for great printing. Not sure who makes them for HP, suppose one of the major manufacturers."
1,Not up to my expectations at all,This Christmas Cake was very disappointing. It was very dry and crumbly. I would not purchase again. Not at all what I'd expect from Food Ireland.
4,Good lights for the money,"These lights are not bad for the money. They are bright. The lenses are glass and the housings are plastic. For the money, I wasn't expecting them to last long. After a year on my boat, they work great and are free of rust. My only complaint is that the mounting hardware provided is not made for saltwater environments and rust quickly. No big deal really as that can be swapped out."
2,Lights are flimsy,"Bought a pair of these lights, installed them on my deck boat and have already broken the housing on one of the lights. This makes twice--but at least it was a different light. Will buy the metal ""cased"" lights for my repalcement. Very flimsy/plastic mounting and housing. Will not purchase again."
1,cheap plastic,The plastic base that attaches to the metal base is very cheap and broke with must minimal movement of the light forward. Do not waste your money on these lights.
2,The Truman Show for Dummies,A watered-down Truman Show for people who couldn't understand or don't want to deal with the larger concepts in The Truman Show.
1,EDTV is like The Truman Show.,I ordered this movie off Pay Per View and I didn't like it. I thought it was a takeoff of The Truman Show. I really liked The Truman Show better than this one. This movie wasn't very good.
1,I couldn't take more than ten minutes of EdTV.,"Maybe my expectations were too much for a Ron Howard movie!??There was nothing of interest to hold one's attention. After ten minutes, I stopped the DVD and returned it. In my opinion, it doesn't rate a star. Home movies shown on TV outrank EdTV.You either dislike it or like it. I don't see a middle ground."
1,See 'The Truman Show' instead...,"After seeing 'The Truman Show', and loving it, I was intrigued when another movie of this ilk was released. And, since 'Apollo 13'-director Ron Howard directed this picture, I figured that it had to be great. 'Twas quite a mistake, matey. This is easily the worst film I have seen in the past two years. Unlike 'Truman', this film is let down by the fact that Ed auditioned to be on the show, and is aware of the cameras at all times. It makes for a movie that is tedious and annoying. Of course, not much can match the joy I felt as the ending credits rolled. Please, spare yourself from this one."
2,UNCONVINCING...,"I expected so much more by director Ron Howard. But, instead, I saw a good idea totally wasted, due to a bad, bureoucratic, uninspired and heartless direction.I kept going fast forward all the time, so bad were some moments in the movie. Don't tell me this is a comedy, because there are very few moments to laugh.Also, ELizabeth Hurley in the cover art is a fake, because her part in the film is very brief. ANyway, I give it two star because the cast did its best, but was badly directed."
2,Save your time,"Reality TV is now old hat. Perhaps this movie predicted a bit of that.The gimmick, however, of the main character talking to his loved ones (and the rest of the world) through the TV camera in real time (no delay -- AS IF!), gets old fast.The story hinges on the preposterous notion that the main character would sign himself into indefinite video slavery, at the will of the TV network.I could tolerate such a stretch if the characters were interesting, or I could tolerate simple characters if the plot were fascinating and airtight. But this flick don't got neither!The Truman Show might not have been a perfect movie, but it at least tried to say something important -- to emotional effect. It was obviously put together with care. EdTV just invites disgust."
1,SHOULD BE RATED R!!!,"I think this should be rated R! It has very mature scenes. My parents aren't strict about what I watch. Im 10 and they let me watch things like ""It"" and ""Jeepers Creepers"" But they made me leave the room several times when I watched it with them. They made me leave because of some of the scenes. And this isn't even R rated. There is a part when Ed is playing with is balls and there is a sex scene. I'm just saying this should be an R movie"
3,Fiction Imitates Facts in EDTV,"A regular guy named Ed finds his life turned upside down when he is chosen to be the star of a reality show where his life is followed by camera crews everywhere. The initial fame is fun but soon grows annoying when his family is drawn into the ever increasing craving for real-life drama on TV. ED TV becomes a hit but it also exposes his mother's lies, his long lost father Hank's bad luck, his ailing stepfather Al, and the bizarre love triangle between Ed and his older brother Gary. Then there is also the romance between Shari who leaves Gary for Ed and then runs away when the public feels she isn't good enough for him. Shari ends up watching Ed romance a model named Jill whose out for fame and the drama gets even more torrid when Ed's mom cheats with his dad, his dad dies, and his brother writes a tell all book. Now Ed must find a way back to his privacy and out of fame before he loses his sanity."
4,A keeper.,"While not normally my favorite kind of movie, I seem to reach for this movie to watch again and again since buying it some time ago. It's just so entertaining."
3,Not a good one,"MCConaughey has a way of rescuing a movie, as youw atch him give his all to a character, to finding nuisances in one. Is this movie really good? Again another not sure. It tries to touch on reality show themes and the price of fame but in trying to be funny, it's softer on the topic than the topic deems necessary."
4,Good Fun,"This movie was recommended by a friend. In turn, we now recommend it to other friends. It was quite enjoyable. It's often compared to The Truman Show, for no good reason. Ed is fully aware that he is on television - Truman isn't. Ed is supposed to be a lighthearted romantic comedy - The Truman Show is anything but. There are more differences than similarities between them, but both are excellent movies for completely different reasons. EdTV's plot is interesting enough, the cast is likeable (with the exception of Liz Hurley), and it's amusing. Ok, it's not the Greatest Movie Ever Made, but it's good viewing, and goes well with pizza and friends. It's also got a high re-watchable value - very important if you're considering buying it for home."
2,"A poor spoof of ""Truman""","I had better hopes for this movie strictly because it was a Ron Howard film. Instead, it was an intentionally campy movie with little more than an occassional joke thrown in. Makes ""The Iron Giant"" look like an oscar winner."
4,What a cute movie!,"Okay, so it doesn't compare to The Truman Show and has some flaws; EDtv is still a very entertaining movie. It's funny and touching, and Matthew McConaughey is just so darn hot, who could resist watching it? Even if you don't pay all the money to buy it, at least try renting it, you won't regret it."
2,not that good,"flat characters, all yelling to make you think they're poor jokes are funny; lots of slapstick and dumb sex jokes; ending is tacked on and fails to give weight to the point the movie seems to be hinting at - Ron Howard uses the human drama only to manipulate, never to actually tell a story...leads are attractive, though."
1,If you've got two hours of your life to waste....,"This is no Truman Show, folks. It is a poor crack at the same genre. The idea behind it was intriguing, and I have seen a few Ron Howard films that have been very good, (""Apollo 13"", for example), so it was quite a letdown. Fear not, Jim Carrey."
5,Nioxin,Does what it says. Came quickly in the mail--never used. The large bottle makes it last a very long time. Can also get a pump for this specific bottle.
1,WRONG ITEM NIOXIN CONDITIONER,I BOUGHT THE CLEANSER AND WAS SENT THE CONDITIONER TWICE. I WAS TOLD BY THE COMPANY THEY WILL SEND ME A CLEANSER AND IT HAS BEEN 4 MONTHS. HAVE SENT EMAILS NO ANSWER. WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR OREDER BE CAREFULL. THE COMPANY CLAIMS IS AMAZONS FAULT ???? STILL DON'T HAVE THE SHAMPOO I PAID FOR.
2,The Formula has Changed,"I had used Nioxin System 1 Cleanser for years. It was wonderful for my baby-fine, thin hair. It left my hair looking full, without any buildup, meaning that I never felt the need to alternate shampoos. I always bought the jumbo size, and recently finished a bottle. The new formula, which is no longer made in the U.S. leaves my hair stiff, dull, flat and coated. After 3 shampoos, I feel the need to use a clarifying shampoo just to get some life back in my hair. I am now looking for a replacement for my favorite shampoo. Nioxin is no longer what it pretends to be!"
3,Works for my husband,My husband's hair showed improvement but it has done nothing for me( I have a high testosterone level). My hair has thinned considerably especially after I stopped using rogaine . The rogaine gave me a lot of coarse facial hair (did I need another problem?)
3,good stuff,"I have yet to see any improvement, but some things cannot be rushed. I try not to pass judgment until I give things a fair chance."
2,don't believe everything you read,"I've used the whole Nioxin system (#1) for about 2 years now. I finally gave up and stopped. After all this time and money spent, I have no perceived increase in hair density like the bottle claims and all it has done is made my hair fall out even more! I know most people say it falls out at the beginning of use because its dead hair and takes time to improve the scalp environment but my hair would fall out after Nioxin use every single time up until today. I'm now going back to regular shampoos and conditioners so my hair will stop falling out! Don't believe in this product... its a rip off. I also confirmed with 2 different Dermatologists that its all a gimmick and does nothing! That, with my own personal experience is definitely proof enough that its a waste of money! Don't waste your time and money people."
2,Weak shampoo strength,I have been using Nioxin Cleanser System 1 for the past 12 years. My recent purchase did not contain the shampoo I have been used to. The liquid content was weak and not of the substance I have been used to buying. It seems to be watered down or not the original formula. The delivered price was a bargain and I was wondering how the supplier could ship one 33.8 ounce and make a profit.
4,Smells Minty and Cleans Well,"I don't know if it has slowed my hair loss because I'm not keeping track. It cleans my hair really well though, squeaky clean. Also, I feel better about myself since at least I'm trying to stop hair loss."
3,This product works fine but it is not what I ordered.,"I ordered Nioxin Cleanser for Fine Hair, System 1, Natural Hair as it is showed on description but It came with Nioxin Cleanser for Fine Hair, System 2, Natural Hair. The cleanser works fine and I really don't care if it is system 1 or system 2. However I think the product description and image should match to the actual product. The cleanser was clear color which is different from blue color what I used to use. Is System 2 color different from System 1 ???"
1,Nioxin did not help a bit,"I used Nioxin shampoo/conditioner/scalp therapy religiously for 6 months and saw no improvement.As a matter of fact, my hair continues to thin out. Been doing so since menopause (5 yrs.) and I doubt there are any products that will make a change."
3,"The key word is ""Perceive""","This is a good shampoo, but don't expect your hair to grow back. Even Nioxin claims on its bottle as ""9 out of 10 people perceived increase in hair density.."". The keyword is ""Perceive"".. If you want to ""perceive"" that your hair is regrowing or thickening, this is your product. Otherwise, this is another expensive shampoo..FYI- I've tried, Nioxin system 1 and 2 shampoo & conditioner (6+ months), Nioxin vitamins (6+months), and the liquid treatment for 3+ months. My hair feels soft and clean, but no result. I did ""PERCEIVE"" that my hair density increased, but no regrowth. Use Head & shoulders thickening shampoo for $2.99 instead of wasting money like me."
5,Great Amaryllis Book,"If you like Amaryllis, you will love this book. Great photos that are just as good as the plant. The only work to see a fantastic amaryllis is to turn to the next page, even though it may be hard to leave the page your viewing. You can always turn back the pages and start over."
4,Bath Toy,"The boys love it as a bath toy, it makes it easier to get them in the bath as they love to resist taking one."
1,Junk is an understatement,"My preschooler has been wanting a diver for the bath for a while now. He saw a bin of these at a local bookstore and wanted me to get him one. Most of them were already broken and so I said I would find him one online. I could not find ANY other wind-up type diver tub toys so I called the bookstore back after they got a new shipment to have them hold one, but they said they couldn't find one that worked! So, I decided to try good ol' Amazon. Ordered it and, sure enough, it didn't work when it arrived. You could wind it up, but no movement. I called Amazon and told them what happened and they shipped me a new one. This time it arrived without a head -- and the winding mechanism STILL didn't work! Under any normal circumstance I would have never bought this in the first place, but it was the only moving bath tub diver I could find. Shame on them for making a product that can't even start out working! Calling it junk is just way too kind."
3,"its an ok toy for a 4 yr old,but......","I bought this toy for my 4 yr old grandson along with some other bath toys he wanted. Needless to say I'm not too sure how durable or how long its gonna last, of course that could always be the case with 4 yr old kids anyway because they seem to always want to find out what makes it tick. Beings it was a gift, without a box and/or its orignal wrapper, it was one tough cookie to wrap, but after inventing a box to fit I did accomplish my goal to finally wrap it. I havent recieved a phone call after a week, so maybe so far, so good. This toy is'nt worth what I paid for it, but if it makes my grandson happy, well maybe it is!....."
1,Do not buy this,"My 5 year old played with this twice in the the tub and it broke. He was not rough with it. Even when it did work, it didn't work very well. Over all it was a cheap toy, but for only getting to play with it twice, it was too expensive. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY."
4,Neat!,This diver was bigger than I expected it to be. We haven't tried him out yet cause he is going in my little guys stocking for x-mas. But so far...by the looks of it...NEAT!
4,Falls apart ...,This was a cute diver guy I purchased for my son to play with in the tub/pool. He fell apart pretty quick but my son did enjoy the time he had with this cute wind up toy!
1,Waste of money.,"Sadly, this was a waste of money. This potentially fun little bath toy worked for all of 5 minutes, literally."
1,Junk.,"My husband was so excited to order this toy for our son, but it broke the first time we put it in the bath. The turn dial is stripped, so now the diver doesn't kick."
1,Garbage!,It only could swim in circles because only one flipper moved. Then it stopped working altogether after only a few weeks. Such garbage!
3,different,"My greatgrandson enjoys this in the bathtub, and it's worth the price of the toy, but doesn't do much other that kick it's feet-sometimes."
3,My 3 year old likes it,"My 3 year old wound this up too far and then it won't kick his legs any more. I found a tiny screw driver in our collection at home that fits it and opened it up and the metal coil inside was able to unwind and it worked again. This has happened several times, but it keeps bouncing right back. My son mostly plays with it and makes it move himself anyway so he didn't really care either way. He has never used it in the bathtub, but we brought it to to every pool and beach we went to this past summer. Any toddler boy that spotted this wanted to ""share"" with him as well. Fun for my son, but don't expect too much."
3,Horror Classics Vol. 8 - ID#12309,"Four movies on one disc.Horror Classics Vol. 8 - Platinum Disc ID#12309#1: Don't Look in the Basement! - 1973 - Director: S.F. Brownrigg#2: House on Haunted Hill - 1959 - Director: William Castle#3: The House on the Edge of the Park - 1980 - Director: Ruggero Deodato#4: Werewolf in a Girls Dormitory - 1961 - Director: Paolo HeuschAll in all; decent picture, decent sound. Nothing special, but menus all seem to work and thats rare for cheap compilation DVD's.These movies are available individually from amazon, so you can see actual reviews and movie details if you search for the title under DVD's."
3,Good but grainy,"I think because they compressed four films onto one disk it really effected the picture quality, it looks kind of pixelated. If you can get past the mediocre picture quality these are good films for a decent price. My personal favorite being ""Don't Look in the Basement"", with ""The House on Haunted Hill"" not far behind."
3,for piano trio lovers,"Renee Rosnes is a well-regarded pianist whose CD's can nonetheless be hard to find. This CD seems to be a Japanese import, I didn't see any reviews of it on American jazz websites. It's a piano trio CD, she's backed by Peter Washington and Lewis Nash, a rhythm section that's easy to find on other contemporary jazz CD's. I'm a tough reviewer of piano trio CD's because it isn't my favorite format (I like horns and/or guitar). With that in mind, this CD is pitched basically right down the middle. There's a mix of tempos (""Suddenly It's Spring"" is fast, ""Lush Life"" is slow) but it's a tidy-sounding CD. The program is mostly standards, though some of them, like ""The Duke"", are more famous than others. Renee's one original, ""Dizzy Spells"" is the most vibrant and unique-sounding song on the CD. I'd enjoy more if she shook it up a little bit, like on ""Dizzy Spells"", but maybe she was aiming it to some specific Japanese market niche?"
4,A pleasant surprise,"Her playing doesn't challenge the imagination, but is, nevertheless, beautiful and the trio plays together as an ensemble well."
3,Un cinéfilo nostálgico,"Interesante recopilación de films de ciencia-ficción, todos o casi todos desconocidos para el gran público. Inevitablemente hay algunos poco destacables junto a otros que sí lo son; para juzgar también hay que tener presente el año de realización. Una pena que carezca de subtítulos en diferentes idiomas, pues sólo tiene la opción del idioma inglés."
4,Sousa Modified,"I rated this ablum four stars on the bases of the treatment of the first march, ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" and the fact that one can only hear brass instruments. The first few notes of the ""Stars and Stripes"" are not clear and the last strain of the music, one can not hear the piccolo and flutes playing there obligato parts. The music is all brass through-out the ablum. It is nice to hear a brass band playing Sousa but other instruments are equally important in Sousa's music. However hearing Sousa's music, especially the selections on this CD, played in any form is a great experience . . .especially great to hear the clear and precise articulation by all of the brass instruments."
4,Ann-M in the bathtub scene chopped...a sin,"I love this movie about the business man who goes completely ""natural""...who then joins up with Ann-M who wears nothing but sweaters with no pants while riding ""hogs"" for the whole movie--but there is a party scence at a mansion near the end--where you see Ann M dropping her clothes to join the prophet in the bath..and then a Cardinal playing cards gets up to go to the bathroom ---and the payoff must be when the cardinal walks in on AnnM and the Prophet in the bath....but on this VHS...it's just -blip- the next day....I know they cut the juiciest AnnM moment--- how sad. I know the bathtub scene from memory because they once played this movie everyday for a week on an obscure UHF station. P"
3,Ann-Margret: passed her Hwood peak but on the comeback trail,"Having no other choice but to leave Hollywood for Italy(where the only movie offers were), Ann-Margret got a big surprise in 1968 when her ""Tiger and the Pussycat"" with Vittorio Gassman managed to turn a small profit; this one is the follow-up, not made in '76 but also in 1968, wherein Gassman plays a hermit lured out of seclusion and proclaimed a profit, and Ann-Margret co-stars as a sexy local girl in on the action. It's threadbare moviemaking, but not without inspiration. A-M, a bit blowsier than before and unencumbered with character details, plows through at full speed, relying on her smoky quality. As a film it ain't much, but strictly as a star-vehicle it has some appeal."
5,"Efficient, well-designed reacher","I have 4 reachers - this is definitely the best of the bunch! Picks up everything I aim for, large or small. One slight problem: the magnet at the end is very strong and sometimes attaches itself to appliances, other metal objects. Nevertheless, I recommend it, especially for shorter people."
5,Reacher/grabber,"Excellent for picking things up without having to bend down. Very useful for folks unable to bend over (e.g.,after leg or hip surgery)."
1,Broke first time used it.,"I am sorry to have to give a review like this but if the product is bad, it is bad. I would have given it a zero if it was available. Please don't buy this product."
4,"Not as good since reformulated, but still beautiful","The newer formulation has a lot less of the oakmoss and jasmine than the vintage, but it's still so elegant. I don't get the peaches and florals in the drydown as much, but the dusty-spicy-powdery feel with that green-fruity tinge underneath is amazing, nothing like anything coming out now."
4,Mitsouko,"A heavy, mature (not in a bad way) fragrance. Very warm. I find it best for winter wear. Lots of lasting power and projection. With my chemistry it's not at all fruity. Lots of earthy oakmoss, cinnamon, vetiver and bergamot. Mitsouko will not be everyone's cup of tea. To me it's a very cozy scent, like a down comforter & hot herbal tea. Recommended for those 25+"
3,Not as good as in the old days,"Guerlain is undoubtedly one of the greatest perfume houses in the world. However, some EU regs in the 80's caused them to change the ingredients and formulations of some of their older perfumes, including this one. This doesn't smell the same as vintage Mitsouko. I re-sold it."
5,The Fragrance of My Self,"The experience of a fragrance is so very subjective, that a listing of its ""notes"" can convey only a superficial impression. The unavoidably subjective review of a scent runs the risk of not being helpful to the majority of its readers, if to anyone at all.A very small bottle of Mitsouko perfume was my very first fragrance, selected and purchased by me and for my own use. I was in my adulthood. This scent helped me to realize the deep, warm and complex, gently romantic core of my emotional self, my true mind and heart. Voluptously sensual rather than sexy. After many years, I now am working on a 2.5 ounce gift bottle of this eau de parfum (spray). Mitsouko remains my closest fragrance companion, even as other fragrances trip past my nose. (Guerlain's Samsara is in the close second place, with Patou's Joy in the more distant third.) One way that I use Mitsouko EDP is to spray one light squeeze between two of my several bed pillows; that helps carry me away into restful sleep."
3,too strong a fragrance,"I first smelled this perfume on a woman in the grocery store. Our paths crossed several times and I had to ask her what it was. Aside from the pre-measured application being too much and creating too strong a fragrance, I adore this perfume."
5,Must read for divorcing people,"As the publisher of Divorce Magazine a lot of books about divorce come across my desk and this is one of the best I've seen. Stacy provides honest, straight forward advice from a very experienced and competent lawyers point of view.I highly recommend it.Dan Couvrette"
3,Divorce: Its All About Control... by Stacy D. Phillips,This is a good book for those who have not already been made aware that the battles causing divorce are all about control issues.
5,Helpful,"I found this book helpful not just for someone considering divorce, but also as a relationship guide. Stacy has seen it all, and she can help you evaluate your control of a very tough situation. I felt fortunate to be able to use her advice, and it will ultimately save legal fees. The book convinced me to take control of the parts of my life that I had let slip and to feel good about those areas where I'd maintained control all along."
5,This is a classic of the genre. And the bio provided is a fascinating insight concerning the remarkable author.,"If you have only seen the two films (and one sad TV) version, you will be delighted to discover the real work."
3,Suspend belief,"too many twists that are improbable. The plot line has coincidental occurrences and events that strain credulity. Yes it's fiction, but it has to have some connection to reality to be believable."
4,cute frame!,I received this frame directly from amazon.com it was chipped (where the flowers are) it needed much more padding during shipment. Amazon.com replaced the frame within 2 days! SUPER EASY and the replacement was perfect. Goes perfectly with the WB Teaberry set!
5,Brooklyn Tabernacle - Live This Is Your House,"I have really enjoyed the CDs. I really like every song on both CDs. The CDs are awesome, The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir did an awesome job on the songs."
5,Beautiful worship,The music on this cd is really awesome. I found myself loving and rating every song (minus the spoken parts) at least 4/5. I would highly recommend it to anyone. You will not be disappointed.
5,A must for your Praise Collection,This is one of my favorite praise CD sets. Truly inspirational songs sung from the heart by a spirit led church. It will lead you into worship.
3,"Nice leather, but hinges not sturdy",Nice leather with that authentic leather smell. Hinge on opening are held together with light duty nail. One has already dropped out.
2,You get what you pay for,Least expensive racquet string I've ever bought. Poorest performing string I've ever tried. Thick in the grommets and heavy. Actually increased racquet weight by .15 oz. Boardy and non responsive by itself at 60 lb. Notched easily as a cross with poly. Use only for people who can't tell one string from another. Don't know about durability cut it out after one session. Very soft easy to string.
4,I LIKE THE LIBERTINES!!!,"It's too bad that THE LIBERTINES second album is their last! They were a real talented band making good punk rock a la The Clash and The Smiths. Really like their debut UP THE BRacket, and really like THE LIBERTINES 2nd album!"
2,Struggling with abrasive apathy,"2 1/2While not flat out terrible, the once snarling collective finds the sophomore jinx setting in by providing contradictory values- the once unhinged, literate post-punk snapped off and boxed into tidy niblets of pop."
4,Elegantly wasted,"This brilliant trainwreck of an album proudly joins the ranks of other zonked-out masterpieces like Neil Young's ""Tonight's the Night"" and ""Big Star's ""Sister Lovers"" -- and that's not faint praise, folks. ""Can't Stand Me Now"" is really the lone fully-realised tune here (and it's a mindblower, of course); the rest are just fragments of mad genius -- echoes from last night's party. Amazing stuff."
3,Decent but disappointing,"I expected more from the Libertines - but that's what I get for putting my hopes on a heroin junkie. I like Doherty's voice and the CD has some pretty good tunes, especially the opening track, ""Can't Stand Me Now"". But it's like they're still trying to find themselves, and most of the songs don't hit the mark. But it's worth a listen now and then."
3,"interesting, but a bit unrefined","they have an 80's/sort-of-punk/skater music flavor. remind me a little of the clash, the vandals, or a less sold-out version of green day. maybe a little of the stray cats. very rockabilly, raw sound. but me likey"
3,The Libertines Faltering First Effort,"I'm not quite sure what I was expecting with this album, but I have to admit I was surprised. The Libertines struck me as a harder band, but I was wrong. Opening this album is possibly my favorite song of all, ""Can't Stand Me Now"". It's catchy and upbeat - a great opening. However, the remainder of the album seems to fall into obscurity, with some songs being difficult to decipher from the last one. Overall, not a terrible first effort, and perhaps it's just one of those groups that one has to 'get' to really enjoy. I don't know.Either way, the Libertines have produced an album that is appealing in the same way as a high-school reuinion. It's nice to go back to every now and then, but not really something that one could withstand every day. Hopefully, the lead singer can control his coke addiction long enough to make a second album. It might just be brilliant."
3,"A Step Down From ""Up The Bracket""","Overall, this album is definetely a step down from their awesome debut. They seem to have mellowed out a little bit, which is all well and good, except for the fact that the melodies seem to leave with the energy displayed on the 1st album. While there are some good points (""Last Post on the Bugle"", ""Man who would be king"") and some unbelievable cuts (""Can't Stand Me Now""), this album is overall very average."
2,Boring and self-absorbed,"The second record from this ""latest thing"" British rock band is as boring and predictable as they come. Musically, the band is gifted with energy courtesy of a competent rhythm section, but there's nothing new or remotely interesting about the music. And frankly, the lyrics show a level of self-absorption and self-destructiveness that is nauseating when coming from these spoiled pretend-to-be-outsiders. Strictly for adolescents who are so immature as to hold on the conceit that nobody understands them."
1,Rather disappointing,"I thoroughly enjoyed Up the Bracket, and was expecting their follow-up to have a similar vibe, a mixture of punk and pop. Instead, most of these new songs sound like pure pop outtakes. There's no punk feel to the album at all. The songs feel rushed and incomplete, as if they were recorded as they were being written, like they were just goofing around in the studio. Some of the songs are just plain unlistenable. The few decent songs don't nearly make up for the bad ones. Clearly these guys have talent - why they chose to waste it on this effort is puzzling."
3,"I love the Clash!! Oh wait, this isn't the Clash? Hmm....","Well, that says it all doesn't it? This album is not original in anyway shape or form. It is pure unadulterated Clash. Of course when you have Mick Jones producing those things can happen. But the Libertines aren't the Clash. No where near it. So if you don't mind an album that sounds just like the Clash only not as good, then get yourself this cd. If you are a Clash fan and hate it when the newer bands rip them off then don't waste your money. It is a good cd for what it is. Better than their last, but still, it is time to be original boys."
5,Instant relief,"After initially considering doing a video review of this product, I thought better of it, and decided a few words would suffice.I assume, if you're reading this, you're probably doubled up on the couch waiting for the pain to subside, and the invisible leprechaun with the razor blade at your rectum is currently working his magic, like a drunk apprentice butcher at your most private of parts.Well, after two weeks of agony and several tubes of the 'H' brand, I finally sought a better product and found this. Wow, what a difference! Immediate relief and my life is starting to get back to normal after only two days of using this stuff. Obviously, the grapes are still there but the pain between movements is hardly there at all.I would recommend this product to anyone who has had their rectum turned into a destroyed-um, by the devil's grapes.My only negative is that it did take a week to arrive, pay the extra and get express shipping. It's worth it!"
2,Does Not Act as an Anesthetic.,"Does not do what it is advertised to do. It is cream based so there is slight relief obtained from that, but there is no ""fast relief"" of anything because of no ""anesthetic"" anything to the affected area. Very disappointing."
4,tronolane cream,this cream is better than most on the market. I like the 1 oz size easy to carry in my purse
4,"Witty, in an annoying way","While this book provides good information on many basic concepts in C++, many of the author's snappy one-line answers are downright annoying. For example:Q: What is a downcast?A: Trouble.Or this:Q: Why is downcast dangerous?A: It's like walking on a highwire without a safety net.Or this:Q: What is contravariance?A: The glue that holds OO together.Many people will find the one-liners amusing, I am sure. Personally I think they are a waste of paper. Good practice should always be making definitive statements in the one-liner, and put the descriptive ones in the paragraph that follows, not the other way round.To sum up: good technical advice, dubious style."
1,too out-dated,"Worthless due to the changes in c++. Don't waste your time. Not even as a reference book is it good for,"
4,One of my favorites,The Moody Blues has been one of my favorites for a long time and this is a great way to listen again.
3,Lacks the intensity of the reel to reel recording,"As a major fan of the MB from the 60's & early 70's, I can feel their songs in my bones. Thousands of hours have I listened. However, this cd lacks the intensity of the original recordings. If there is a true rendition of the reel to reel, please let me know and I will buy it. New comers to this group, seek out the originals before making a determination on the MB."
2,not so hot,"The CD was of songs I never heard of, of one I knew, it was not the familar version I came to like. Wish I can trade the CD in to get my money back"
5,Amazon made one of my wishes come true!,"The album ""This is The Moody Blues"" is a great album. Every thing was remastered to be exactly like the original, the songs are in the original order. Listening to it was great.Jim ShockleyTwin Falls, IDPS: I have also bought a hard to find DVD movie""Mission To Mars"", I also found this to be of goodexcelent quality."
1,The DVD looks almost the same.,"Like many other HD DVD and Blu Ray there is little difference in quality specially if you screen about 50"" or less. Save your money."
1,STARGAPE!!,"How many editions of this hideous movie does the world need.The only good thing about it is Kurt Russell.After an interesting beginning it is downhill for the rest of the movie as JAYE DAVIDSON from THE CRYING GAME tries to play an alien disguised as a man instead of a man disguised as a woman.This movie is ATROCIOUS drivel that delivers only embarrasing lines like ""There can only be one RA!"" (they should not have altered DAVIDSON'S voice, then he could have played another one dimensional drag queen in this travesty)And what is with the CHEAP CGI? Sorry, but so quick you can't see it doesn't cut it with me.Yes this movie is an atrocity with a cast of thousands."
1,Another day another rip of 'special edition',Is there any reason to buy this supposed 'special' edition if you already own the first Blu Ray release? Absolutely not.
4,Nice Extras,"The best part about this release for me is that it's widescreen and has a pretty nice commentary. Though I will say one thing about the commentary, it is entirely from the view of the directors. No actors take of a scene or anything, it's mostly the design of the sets, musical score, &etc.; Having said that, it's nicely done for what it is.The movie itself is still as cool as always. While it doesn't have any of the deeper thinking stuff that you find in the series, it does have a few nice plot twists, decent character development, and even a bit of a romantic side. Overall a groovy movie :)"
5,excellent,"this movie is well worth seeing. The dvd is crisp, clean, and a family adventure for older children."
3,good but not worth the asking price,"I must admit that when I first saw this movie, I marveled at the then incredible effects and cinematography. It involved a story that was unique and piqued my interest as I've often marveled at the civilizations of ancient Egypt and the Great Pyramid.Altho I did thuroughly enjoy this flick, I certainly don't think it's worth the $1,918.98 list price even WITH the free shipping. It's not even the DVD format version!All in all, save your money and wait for it to be shown on the TNT network again."
3,good but not worth the asking price,"I must admit that when I saw Stargate, I was amazed at the then incredible graphics. The storyline itself was rather unique and piqued my interest since I often marveled at the history of ancient Egypt and the Great Pyramid.Nevertheless, although being an entertaining flick, I certainly don't think it's worth $1,918.98 list price even WITH the free shipping. It's not even in DVD format!Save your money and just wait for it to be televised again on TNT."
2,dvd defective,watched first 1/2 hour - was nice and interesting - but then DVD proved defective and wasted a lot of time - both dvd's were defective.
1,God-awful transfer of Blu-ray version of this film.,"This has been a bad week for me getting 3 different titles on blu-ray and all 3 with dreadful transfers.The grain in this film is (at times) just plain horrible. One scene in particular (around the mid-way point) in a cave it appears it's snowing black and white -- no it's not really snowing -- it's just a mixture of HEAVY grain and what appears to be artifacts.Now not the whole transfer is as bad as this, just sections.I recorded this film from DirecTV's HD-Net movies (or was it MGM-HD?) a few weeks ago and replayed it on my DVR and the same scenes look terrific on the broadcast version so it's definately a problem with the blu-ray transfer.My display is 70"" so maybe if you have a smaller screen you won't notice the disc's problems as much but for those with larger screens I would not recommend this disc."
3,Hate Flipping That Disc,Great movie! Moderate picture quality. Extremely good surround sound track 5.1!The only thing I hated and that is why I am giving it three stars it having to flip the disc at the middle of the movie.
4,Super sound catches up with a super movie..,After two previous DVD's for this movie and the powers that be finally got it right. This is one of the greatest action adventure movies ever made. Adding DTS Surround Sound has put this film in a league of it's own. Superb sound and picture quality are well worth purchasing. WOW!
1,HORRIBLE SOUND EDITTING,whoever did the sound editting for this transition from vhs/dvd to blue-ray should be fired. it was like watching a bad chinese movie when it comes to the sound editting. the sound is literally 2 - 3 seconds off of the movie. not happy.
4,classic sci-fi movie,"This is a good disc. Great image quality, great sound. I did like the extended version. Added a little bit more detail, which I thought was good.For fans of this movie I think this is a great disc to have. I never bought another disc, but from what I've read I didn't really miss much. Consensus seems to be it was done right this time, and I would agree it is a good disc."
1,Not A good blu-ray.,"This is a review of the blu-ray version, not the movie itself.If you already own the DVD version of this? Don't even think about buying this one.Why?Because its not a very good HD conversion. Way to grainy and dark and colorless.My dvd version actually looks better than this one on the 55 inch lcd.This version has horrible picture quality, even at the sub 8 price I paid, I feel I got ripped off.Off all the blurays I have purchased , this is by far the worse transfer I have ever see.Save your money and wait till they do a real HD transfer."
2,Disappointing,"I have always been a fan of this movie. I saw it on the big screen, I own it on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray. I don't really have anything to add to the many available reviews of this movie, but I will comment on the Blu-ray transfer.The BD disc is easily the worst of the several Blu-ray discs that I own. Granted it's an older movie, well over 10 years, but the technology exists now to produce the best-ever transfer of this movie for the new HD formats. The fact that neither the picture or sound of this BD is scarcely better than the existing DVD transfer suggests to me that they rushed this out for a quick market share grab with barely any regards to quality.If you already own this on DVD, don't bother with the Blu-ray, at least not unless and until they produce a new, remastered transfer."
2,Stargate (Extended Cut) [Blu-ray],"Oh Dear.One of my favorite films and I was very disappointed. I wasn't too upset that there was no extras other than a commentry and previews of up coming Lionsgate Blu ray releases.Picture quality was poor and grainy, although on close up's quite detailed. Sound wise very good presented in DTS HD and Dolby 5.1 EX.If you like the film I would suggest you buy the region 1 Artisan ultimate edition which has remastered Theatrical and Directors cuts, as well as 2 featurettes and DTS 6.1 ES."
3,What happened to the 1080p,"I cannot get the movie to play in 1080p as advertised all over the box. I have an HDMI cable between my Blu-ray player and my plasma, but it continually says, 480p. Any suggested or did I get duped?"
5,True Fan,"I am a StarGate fan, the original movie, the SG-1 series, and now Atlantis. I had to get this and am waiting for Continuum to be released."
3,Misinformation,"Amazon Lists several DVD extras that do not appear on what they send you. The DVD you get says Ultimate Edition, but I see nothing ""ultamate"" about what arrives. It only had the featurette ""Is there A Stargate?"" The ""Making Of"" featurette isnt on this, which is upsetting because I really wanted to see that. It def doesnt come with the gold embossed cover but i dont care about that. There is also only one version (not director's and theatrical cuts). There may be other discrepancies that i didnt notice cause i dont pay attention to those aspects, so if i didn't mention it, and it is important to you, i'd ask BEFORE buying! Just be warned that is is a baiy and switch!all in all, it is a decent movie though. Dont njoy all the subtitles when they speak in egyptian. some parts are confusing and some are dark and difficult to see."
3,Great film shame about picture quality,Touted as the new raiders this doesn`t quite live up to that but is still good fun especially with the extra footage.Picture ratio states 1.85:1 on box but is in fact 2.35:1.Sound is first rate on the disc but visually things stink.
2,"Great movie, dissapointing DVD","When I saw this movie in the theatre, my wife and I loved it. We just finished watching the DVD minutes ago, and I must say that I was very annoyed that they put the second half of the movie on the other side of the disc. This movie is 119 minutes. Why it's interupted in the middle is beyond my understanding. They should re-release the DVD with the movie on one side, and the minimal extras on the other.Very dissapointing transfer."
3,Stargate,"The subject was fascinating, but military personnel were totally unbelievable in their behavior on a mission. And how many times must one crank a shell into their weapon? Visuals were good."
1,Picture Quality is Horrible,"Waste of money for the blue ray version, Will never by anything with lions gate on it again"
2,2 sided DVD (movie is split across each side),"I guess this DVD does not utilize any high compression because the entire movie is not on one side, but rather it is split across each side. I think I remember buying DVDs like this years ago, but I assumed that any sold these days would not require one to manually flip the dvd over in order to continue watching it. Then again, it's a 1994 movie so perhaps the DVD was manufactured back then. In any case, I am buying another edition and hopefully the next one will have the entire movie on one side."
4,Stargate Blu Ray,"Blu ray transfer was good and movie was captivating. As usual,however, the extended cut was unnecesary. Why can't directors learn that sometimes more is less and less is more. I guess some people think if they're getting a few minutes more of the movie, they're getting more for their money. By that logic, I guess the next horror will be to release all the film that was shot with no editing. Editors work very hard to create movies that don't drag. If a scene is cut, it usually is because the film was better without it. I can't think of a ""director's cut"" or ""extended cut"" that was better--or even as good--as the original theatrical version."
3,Not quality Blu Ray,"Good movie. This Blu Ray release is not remastered but needs it. The pictures are sharp as expected, but grainy (not pixelly as a DVD would be on a large screen). The grainyness is very noticeable with interior scenes. The colors don't pop. Also, something is funky with subtitles. Where the indiginous language is translated on DVD it is missing on this version, unless you turn on subtitles for the whole movie. Still better than the DVD, and this was only 10 bucks. I'm also not sure where the ""extended cut"" scenes are... seems the same as the regular movie (which is my DVD copy)."
3,Still an enjoyable film,Just for the shear imagination of the concept this movie was a definite for adding to my own Blue-ray collection
2,Stunning transfer- but defective!!,"The subtitles that belong in the film do NOT appear unless invoked manually- and if you do, you have to turn them off again or every word in the whole film will be subtitled. Have no clue how so much work could have been done on this only for this DEFECT to have flown into the final release. BUYER BEWARE."
3,STARGATE (ultimate edition),"Just think of it...you could own the DVD of Stargate, and a year later purchase the widescreen version. Now a year later the ""Special Edition"" comes out. Now we have the ""Ultimate Edition"".Can't wait for the SPECIAL SUPER DIRECTOR'S REDUX 4 DISC SET with a Kurt Russell autograph. ...BR>Of course I have to get it, it's a better transfer with better sound."
2,annoying double sided movie,I purchase the DVD release before the special edition and was really unhappy to find that half way through the movie i had to turn over the god damn disk. I was looking forward to watching stargate on DVD but this just ruined it for me. I am now stuck with a movie i enjoy split on two sides of a disk that can easily fit the movie on one side. I would avoid purchasing this edition as i gather that nothing has changed to most likely still have to flip the disk.
2,Why Put Movie Trailers in this Movie?,"This Blu-ray re-issue of Stargate is absolutely beautiful and the audio track is excellent. I object to this RETAIL, not a rental, movie having SIX movie previews on it. Really people, this is not a video-store rental, I pay retail so I don't have to watch all the advertising. Don't buy the Blu-ray edition with the Blue cover, get the one with the Gold cover and leave the studio's advertising behind."
5,Star Gate Movie Review,I saw the movie years ago and enjoyed it. Now with the DVD I enjoyed it again. Interesting storyline.
3,Good Video and Audio,"Thanks for describing the audio/video quality. All Blu-Ray reviewers should do this.I was not disappointed in the quality. The video quality was good, very good, just not great. Maybe great for a movie this age. There wasn't a lot of grain (I didn't notice any).The audio was DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1, and was very good.There were two versions: The Theatrical version, and the Extended version. I watched the extended version, and it was about 2 hours and 10 minutes.I remembered this movie being much better; more exciting. I was tired when I watched it, and had a hard time staying awake. The concept of the movie is interesting, but the movie just seemed to drag. I thought it was rather boring, but, like I said, I had a hard time staying awake to watch it."
1,Stargate15 Year Anniversary edition: Blu-Ray Doesn't Work on Samsung BD-P1400,"I have a Samsung BD-P1400 Blu-Ray player which I updated with the latest firmware on 7-15-10 using a CD disk from Samsung. The Stargate Blu-Ray movie does not play. A trick which works on this Samsung machine for many other Blu-Ray movies which do not play when is selected is to choose <scenes> or <chapters> at the menu instead of . That trick, which works on the Avitar Blu-Ray disk on this machine, does not work on the Stargate Blu-Ray disk. Any ideas out there on how to play the Stargate Blu_Ray disk on the Samsung player?"
2,"This is not about the movie, is about the Bluray Edition","Please don't continue releasing 'extrapolated vesions' of DVDs. Bluray was designed to provide true 1080i/p resolution, not for 800i grained version of DVDs!"
4,Loved It!,"I was a late convert to the Stargate fan club. Better late than never, I always say. Kurt Russell is a great character, and seeing this movie explained all the references I needed to better understand the show. Good movie! I am still a fan."
2,Lousy transfer...rent it if you must.,Sony was adamant that MPEG-2 was somehow superior to VC-1 and MPEG-4 in terms of video quality...they were wrong. This transfer is very poor quality to begin with; that coupled with an MPEG-2 encode basically ruined the movie for me. The noise is inexcusable as is the subtitle flaw. The first Blu Ray releases have been very disappointing but luckily the studios all seem to have ditched MPEG-2 for newer releases. I wish studios would take a page from Disney's book and not rush titles out the door just to push a format...
4,Most Enjoyable Sci-Fi,"The movie that started it all ... a great TV series that I've looked forward to for years ... all started here ... blending two of my favorite interests ... pseudo-archaeology and sci fi. What could be better ... for me? Not much. :) Not profound, not deep, not leading edge ... but more enjoyable than the vast majority of movies I watch. If you enjoyed the series, it's worth your time to see where it all started and don't worry ... you won't be disappointed."
3,Good sci-fi,"This is a good sci-fi movie and fun to watch. The blu-ray edition is quite good if you take under consideration that it is an older movie. There is a problem with the subtitles, you have to turn them on so you can read the dialogue that takes place in the ancient dialect as they stay on for english too. But overall a good movie that was transfered on blu-ray pretty well."
4,Prelude to a fantastic series,If you are a sci-fi fan this movie is a great beginning to a fantastic series of adventure. After you have seen this movie you will naturally ask yourself what else is out there. From here you go to Stargate SG1... ten seasons of fascinating adventure with a wonderful cast. This movie stars Kurt Russell who can make you believe he can truly do anything that needs to be done. James Spader is also at his best. Even if you don't consider yourself a sci-fi fan you can enjoy this one... adventure at its best. Who knows... what may truly be out there somewhere.
4,Interesting Concept!,"This movie when I first saw it in a private screening before its domestic release. I didn't know what to expect. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.Unique story and an interest premise. The effects are very cool and the Stargate itself is an interesting concept. Kurt Russel begins the movie with his character as being a nasty guy, but then you warm up to him.Jay Davis (The Crying Game) is a really starnge alien leader. I won't give much away but he is like a snake in the grass.James Spader played a great ""nerdy"" scientist and the most unsuspecting leading ""love"" man. He falls in love with the alien female (played by Alexi Cruz)and ends up saving Earth and her planet too.Overall the film is an action adventure but it also has heart. Dena Devling and Roland Emerich wrote this with Roland directing.(This team also cretaed Godzilla and Independance Day!)This is a good modern Sci-Fi film to have in your colleciton."
1,WARNING: BUY THE 15TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION INSTEAD,"If you're currently looking at the Extended version from 2007, DO NOT purchase this piece of crap! Find the 15th Anniversary Edition. I say because these comment boards are exactly the same for both versions of the film. Something Amazon needs to fix!!!I love this movie and purchased this thinking it was the one everyone was raving about based on the comments below. Thankfully I was given a refund because this. But this piece of wasted blue-ray disc literally looks like you're watching a VHS version of the film. It's super grainy. I have this on DVD and the quality of that is better than this."
5,Very good quality,I was one of the unfortunate buyers of the first Blu-ray release which was horrible quality. It was like a VHS tape transferred to BD. This one has stunning audio and video quality. You won't go wrong purchasing this version.
1,Terrible Picture Quality for Blu-ray,I bought the blu-ray edition of the movie and was blown-away at how horrible the picture looked. I'm not sure how they transferred the film to digital but the blu-ray looks worse than DVD copies of the film I've seen. You'll be looking at the TV wondering if its on the fritz becuase there's so much snow and artifacts in the picture - and no I don't mean archeological artifacts either. Avoid the blu-ray version!
3,No Frills,"Sorry, but this one proved to be not as enjoyable as the earlier release (which I had given to a friend as a gift). True, the picture quality of the discis outstsanding -- the best I've ever seen on a DVD. However, there are no extras of any kind on the disc. No director's commentary -- which for me is a must on a DVD; no trailers; no making of documentary. Just the movie itself. Sorry, but I expected better."
4,"Flawed, but well worth your time","Excellent concepts and terrific special effects. James Spader is very cool, but Kurt Russell doesn't have much to work with and only has one expression throughout the movie. The TV series takes all the best elements and does an amazing job.Stargate SG 1 is certainly the best sci fi today."
3,The Original to the TV Series,"My wife really likes the TV series so, when she borrowed the movie from a friend, I figured I'd watch it, too. I enjoyed the movie. This doesn't quite rate among the ""must see"" science fiction but it's definitely worth watching. Not to mention, the movie gives a good background for the TV series.The version we watched was older with very limited extra features. There was some background information about the cast and crew, a teaser and a trailer. If you like special features (as do I), then you would do well to read the fine print before buying, particularly if buying used. My choice would be the 'Ultimate Edition'."
3,lacking in special features,Description for this blu ray is lacking in letting you know what special features are available. Not much included. Seriously lacking in comparison to DVD release. If you're just interested in the movie this is a good buy. If you're looking for all the extras buy the 15th Anniversay Edition.
3,Wonderful F/X Overcome Plot Flaws,"This movie is a lot of fun, although clearly written, produced, and directed by people who haven't a clue about the military.The discovery of the Stargate and the puzzling-out of its origin and operation are the best part of the movie. Once the team gets to Abadoes, the plot falls apart. The special forces soldiers squabble and act generally like spoiled ten-year-olds. The CO is a potential suicide who clearly should not be on active duty. Most of the military characters are laughably miswritten and acted. But put that aside and the rest of the movie is fun.The Showtime series ""Stargate SG-1"" is FAR superior, and is, in fact, the most fun on TV. Too bad the TV series could not have been the feature film.K.B. (retired Navy)"
3,Flipping the disk is dumb,"I like the movie very much. The picture quality is standard DVD quality, which is excellent. The sound is standard DVD quality also. This DVD however can be improved. First of all, it should offer a Pan & Scan version also. Secondly, the DVD is only half on 1 side and the other half on the other. The disk must be flipped over to the other side to finish the movie. That's dumb. I've seen longer movies contained only on 1 side of the disk. Lastly, I do like widescreen movies but this should not be at the sacrifice of losing some of the view from the top and bottom of the movie. Everyone's heads get cut off. This is intentionally done so that the ratio is ""the same"" as in theaters. What they don't tell you is that you don't see as much what's on the sides as you do in the movie theaters. You don't even see as much vertically as the Pan & Scan version. Overall, it's a good DVD movie but needs the little items to make it an excellent DVD."
2,"Poor formatting, flipping the disk mid-movie is annoying.","The first hour of this movie is on side A of the disk, the second hour is on side B. This is highly annoying, especially considering that other DVDs hold up to 4 hours of video on one side. Even though the insert lists 30 ""scenes"", you can only ""jump"" to 10 of them. The movie is good, and the special effects excellent, but I returned the DVD because it is so poorly formatted."
2,"How such an amazing TV show came from this movie, I'll never know","Fantastic idea for a movie with completely awful execution. I'm so glad that the makers of SG-1 saw the potential that was there in this franchise. The only reason I bought this was my wife wanted it.In short, if your wife wants this movie, buy it. Otherwise don't bother unless you really want to see how amazing Stargate SG-1 is compared to its origins."
4,"Well, it comes before the series...","I own this because it comes before the series. The series is better.Basically it's about a gate that was left on earth by aliens who built the pyramids. The gate takes you to the middle of the Sahara desert... oh, wait, it takes you to a far-off world where there are Bedouin - Ooops, no, not Bedouin, other humans seperated from earth. Sorry, I got confused.Anyways, it's neat and you should watch it, then watch the series."
1,I've seen stupid before....,"...but this is an insult to stupid movies. Let's see...we have an advanced, ancient civilization that creates a stargate and we send morons with rifles to neutralize them if we think they're a threat. We have the chief of the advanced speaking like Linda Blair, a linguist who soaks up languages like a sponge, and a crew of guys who go where no man has ever gone before and who want to go home so badly they're about to cry after 30 minutes.Is it possible to make a dumber movie? Really?"
2,"What ""Director's Cut""","Well... I finished watching the director's cut last night. I thought that I would see some of the ""never before released footage"" after the first hour or so, but there was none. I resigned myself to thinking that it was all going to be added at the end, but when I saw those two words, ""The End"" I realized that the movie was over and that there was absolutely NO distinguisable new scenes added to this DVD (The Ultimate Edition). I'm going to watch the Theatrical Release DVD just to see if the DVD publishers made an error when labeling the disks. By the way, the movie itself is great. This reminds me of the time when I rented the movie, ""To Sir With Love"" which had a wide screen and full screen side on the DVD. When I put the wide screen side into the DVD player up came, ""Godzilla vs. Space Godzilla."" Ooops, publisher pressed the wrong button on the duplication machine."
2,All smoke and no fire!,"This movie builds up pretty good to the moment when the soldiers cross the wormhole, but it is downhill from there on. The egyptian theme is fine, but the rendition of it is poor and limited. This film feels almost rushed with little care to improve depth and details of the story and characters. Overall: MEDIOCRE."
2,HOW?!?,"After watching this film, I asked myself one question:HOW did MGM and the new (and better!) writers get from THIS awful piece of science fiction junk to the excellent, award-winning tv series?!?Well, for a start they got a new leading man in the form of Richard Dean Anderson. Due to his own unique sense of humour, the character of Jack O'Neill was re-written from guilt-ridden, suicidal soldier of the movie to a caring, handsome and funny man whom the audience can actually give a damn about.Secondly, they re-cast the role of Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and added Captain Sam Carter (Amanda Tapping) and Teal'c (Chris Judge) to make a complete team who actually seem like normal, believable characters and human beings rather than objects.I find it amazing how this TERRIBLE piece of cinema 'entertainment' produced something so great! And as for Mr Devlin and Mr Emmerich's comments about the series being dreadful, I have two words: Sour Grapes!"
5,Incredible special effects and new footage adds excitement!,"The new ""Stargate"" certainly is incredible. Even though some of the edited scenes are questionable as to why they were removed, they make the movie better. The beginning is totally altered, revealing the truth behind the stargate. Also it is only available in the widescreen format...that's a definite plus!!!"
1,Do not buy this DVD,"This was a huge disappointment as I love this movie and it should have come alive with a real Blu-ray conversion. Unfortunately the studio must have taken the ultimate quick-and-dirty get it out fast approach. Honestly, my original DVD is better than this ""Blu-ray"". In fact, my copy does not even have the sub-titles when they are talking in the ancient language. I ended up translating for my audience. I have also decided not to buy another Blu-ray from Lionsgate unless I see a solid review first."
2,Quality,"This I must say as a kid was my favorite movie. The Movie is good and that's what saves this. The reason I gave it two stars is because the video quality is horrible for bluray standards. I own other blurays and this is the worst I have seen. The special features are slim also. Back to quality of dvd the audio is great, picture is bad with signs of decent when there is light dark scenes look like standard early dvds. So just buy it on standard."
5,good quality blu ray edition,"This is a very clean version of Stargate - no noticeable debris from the film scan.The image quality varies rather noticeably - there are multiple scenes with verygrainy image quality. So grainy that it's very objectionable. Tends to be thelower light scenes obviously.As mentioned elsewhere, the sub-titling of the alien language only shows upif you turn on sub-titles. This is stupid and we rewatched several scenesonce we realized the dialog HAD to have sub-titles and went looking.If this is an extended cut, I couldn't tell the difference.Audio is really clean.Worth replacing your dvd copy."
2,Flawed in a big way,"I love this move. I have been a fan of it since it was in the theaters. I jumped on the chance to own the high def version on Blu-ray. Anyone who has watched this movie before knows how much dialog in needs to be translated through subtitles during the movie. The problem with this disk is that the disk doesn't force any subtitles leaving the dialog completely untranslated. Even if you have seen the movie, and know what they are saying it is a huge problem. Tried to contact Lion's gate about the problem but they appear to be unwilling to even offer up a real e-mail address and they stopped answering their phones. Unless you can live with this problem do not buy this item."
3,STARGATE The Ultimate Artifacts Edition,Come on Artisan how can you say that this new STARGATE (Ultimate Edition) DVD has a Newly Remastered Picture. The picture quality is loaded with ARTIFACTS. What kind of 35MM Negative did they use for remastering? All the dark indoor sceens show heavly artifacts and the outdoor lighted shots are beautifully crisp? See for yourself! The Sound is unbeatable. The best sounding DVD I own. But there is no way that this picture quality was remastered. Buyers Beware!
2,A special edition this is not!,"I was completely and utterly dissapointed with the quality of the transfer on this DVD. A great sci-fi movie like this one deserves better treatment. It would probably look fine on a 27"" 4:3 television... but any larger, you'll see ""jaggies"" all over the place from the non-anamorphic transfer.Apparently an announcement will be made in a few weeks regarding a re-release. Hopefully with more attention to detail. But, now I have to find someplace to unload this piece of tripe."
3,"Fairly good movie, very bad DVD","Not much to say about the movie that hasn't already been said. You either like it or you don't.However, I'm horribly disapointed with this as a DVD. The film transfer is terrible; It has been over-enhanced and sharpened artificially. The over-processing has destroyed many scenes, causing horrendous aliasing on anything with contrast or fine detail. There are halos around people (look at any shot outside where someone is against a sky for instance). There's a lot of dirt in several dark scenes that was never cleaned up and it screams out like mad.What a disapointment, especially for a ""Special Edition""."
3,Disappointing,"The only reason I give this movie 3 stars is because it's still a great story. The quality of the Blu-Ray was less than marginal. I was expecting a lot considering how many advertisements I had seen about this release on Blu-Ray. The whole movie to me was very grainy. I felt as if I was watching the movie as a kid on my old 19"" Quasar TV when it was first released. The only plus out of the whole purchase was that I bought the movie for half the price it would have cost at a Retail Store like Worst Buy."
5,Kurt Russell Fan -- and fan of SG-1,"This movie is wonderful. The intrigue, the mystery, the wonder of traveling through the gate, discovering a ancient civilization, finding the way back home (in more ways than one) - all are covered in this movie. It pulls you in and doesn't let you go until the end. I love Kurt Russell and he is great in this movie, even though he's not the only main character. And to see that such a movie brought to TV, has lasted 10+ years is amazing!It's such a great adventure - a must see for those who have not seen it and for those who have - they'll see it over and over again!!!!"
3,What a way to ruin a good movie.,From an artistic standpoint..... Stargate is a fine movie. To bad we had to flip the DVD over in mid-movie. My laser disk player could have done that for me. Quite a disappointment in DVD format. How 'bout a re-release on one side?
4,"EMINENTLY WATCHABLE, IF ONLY FOR ALIENS IN EGYPT","Fantastic story of intergalactic travel that's certainly a worthy rental. Imagine a cross between the Twilight Zone and The Ten Commandments spruced up with laser guns and bazookas. Mili Avital is quite the bomb as Sha'uri. Keep an eye out for Horus (Djimon Hounsou), none other than Cinque from 'Amistad.' Russel and Spader need little applause, they go about their business with a single-minded devotion. Don't expect E.T. type wonder and awe at every alternate pace, the whole extravaganza is fast-paced and compulsively watchable in a way that only a foolhardy scifi movie can be. Highly recommended for people looking for some action."
2,Who needs a realistic plot?,"How this movie came to have such a large following of fans I have yet to figure. The writers must have decided that plot was less important than visual interest, and threw everything but the kitchen sink into the movie: ancient Egyption symbolism, desert sands, strange animals, metamorphing guards, military weaponry, futuristic stun guns, flying alien aircraft, pyramids, space ships, atomic bombs, teleporting gates, and an ancient alien god-figure. Then add a mix of romantic love interest, nerd versus bully imagery, and a patriotic vision of a rebellion of slaves versus evil master. Can you imagine what the writers were thinking?To be fair, the movie has a lot of visual interest and the action does hold the attention. Just don't try to think too deeply about the plot."
2,it doesn't get any more mediocre than this,i can't say that this film was bad or good. it fell right on the borderline. i don't know why i bothered to see it.
2,.,"I have not seen the special edition, but I would be profoundly surprised if it much improved upon this poor film. A few nifty effects and a potentially interesting premise are all that this movie has going for it. The characters are flat and unengaging, the pacing is awkward, the details are corny, the aesthetics are disappointing, the action isn't very exciting, and ... well, you get the idea. The fact that this film gets so many good reviews simply reminds me what painfully low standards many science fiction fans seem to have."
1,Awful Bluray Disc,"This is only about the Bluray. It's very slow to load. If you don't give the apps network access, it doesn't work at all, ...Can we some when start getting blurays that simply contain the movie, are playable and let you jump around in the menus as you wish ?"
4,A Special DVD,"The Special Edition of the Stargate DVD is definitely a better purchase than the original. This way you have a choice of viewing the original theatrical release of the longer edition which I must say has only been seen on TV on Showtime once as a means of getting people to watch their series Stargate SG-1 which is also making it's way out on Video (Pilot already on DVD). It is a good film and the longer copy is easily seen as the better film, especially since we see immediately after the opening credits a piece of that longer footage; the fact that the Stargate existed millenia before Katherine as a child and her family discovered it in Egypt. Not the best sci-fi film of 1994 but enjoyable. Kurt Russell's and James Spader's role's are well performed."
1,Stargate Special Edition,"The low rating I am giving this disc does not reflect my opinion of the film, but rather my opinion of the discs poor quality. The below average image quality is surprising, considering the fact that this is already the second DVD release of this movie. Not only is the overall image quality not as good as it should be, but to top it off the entire film features a video burn on the right hand side of the picture. Lower end monitors may cut this area off and therefore hide it, but a good screen will feature this irritating flaw. One can only hope that a Superbit or Criterion version of this film will be released one day. The disc presently available is certainly a disapointment."
1,Blu-ray version is defective and LionsGate won't replace it,"Search the Internet and you'll find out this Blu-ray version has at least two defects; missing Egyptian and alien subtitles, and right half of main menu doesn't work (you can still change audio and commentary other ways, but I can't get to the THX demo or setup.Don't buy any Blu-ray titles produced by LionsGate. They're not honest businessmen."
2,"Buy the Special edition verion, NOT THIS VERSION!","The resason for me giving this film only 2 stars is that in the middle of the film, you have to flip it over to watch the second half. This is VERY frustrating. Buying the special edition version, you won't have to worry about this. This is a great film and I wonder who the brilliant mind behind this version's editting is (i.e.- cutting the film in two parts)."
2,Good.,"I am a fan of this movie but the Blu Rau version does not ""cut the mustard"", so to speak. First the picture is very grainy but sharp. I would say this is due to the original print, not the format of disc. The sound is good. The subtitles on this disc are messed up. You have to turn the subtitle on to get them (for ancient egyptian), but then you get the subtitles for english as well. The DVD ""Ultimate"" version is the best copy of this movie out right now. The level of detail from the Blu Ray disc is not great enough to warrent an upgrade if you own this version on DVD. I believe my favorite version of ths movie was the laser disc version, it toned down the grain, held a sharp picture, and the sound rocked, better than the DVD versions."
3,ALIENS ANSWER ANCIENT MYSTERIES?,"STARGATE - Ultimate Edition is the third version on DVD of this visually striking and sometimes hokey tale about an ancient artifact that can zap explorers to a distant Mars-like world. It's a little misleading to call this the ""Ultimate Edition) as it merely transfers the director's cut of the film from the previous ""Special Edition"" (but now in anamorphic and not letterbox widescreen) which includes nine additional minutes cut from the theatrical and subsequent first DVD version. Got that straight? Cool extras abound, however.There's a spooky documentary in which Erich Von Daniken discusses his ""Chariots of the God's"" theory of extra-terrestrial visitations in ancient times. The sound on the feature has been remixed in a thunderous 6.1 DTS ES track. There are commentaries and a nice 23 minute making-of featurette."
4,Stargate,"The director/producer team of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, who gave us Independance Day and Godzilla [ ] first produced this inventive and exciting Sci Fi flick. I'm not usually a fan of this genre, but this one is actually rather good compared with traditional science fiction. Starring Kurt Russell and James Spader, the film is basically a homage (French for ""rip-off"") of the old Sci Fi stories, but there are some interesting ideas and a series of terrific action set-pieces. The story consists of an Egyptologist who discovers the secret of an ancient relic called the Stargate. The explorer solves the puzzle and then he and a team of soldiers enter the Stargate and discover a city of people who are descendants of the ancient Egyptians. The people worship gods who are actually an alien culture, and then the trouble begins. Great stuff. Dissapointing DVD extras though, with only production notes. One hopes this will be re-released in a ""Special Edition"" soon."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD,"Don't buy this DVD. Don't get me wrong this is a wonderful movie, but the DVD is terrible. The DVD is single layered which means half way through a longer movie, like this one, you have the distinct pleasure of flipping the disc over to enjoy the other half of the film. All is not lost though; there was another edition, a special edition, released shortly after this one that you don't have to flip over. Not only that but it contains a few more special features and instead of this edition's 119min. run time, it runs for 128min. The special edition is for sale here on Amazon.com and actually cost a few dollars less!"
3,Good Time-Waster,"I pointed out to my daughter that the same person who directed ""Independence Day"" also directed this movie. She replied, ""Is that why they're both so good?"" Well, truth to tell, I thought Independence Day was a pretty good movie because it didn't pretend to be anything more than a good earth vs. bad alien movie made to entertain people. Stargate attempted to be a bit deeper but ended up being silly. No more so than the old black and white sci-fi movies I used to watch on weekend afternoons or late Saturday nights, I guess. I liked those and I liked Stargate as long as I accept them for what they are- implausible and somewhat silly. But they're fun, too. My two kids really liked this movie and found it fascinating, and I'm sure I would have felt the same way when I was their age."
3,Great movie but an early DVD transfer,The sound on this DVD seems not as good as others I have in my collection. I found the picture quality OK and obviously the story is superb. Having to turn the disk over is a real pain. The original movie was in DTS so I'm hoping a DTS DVD will appear where they can rectify the sound.
5,great movie for an unbeatable price!,"I've always been a fan of this movie and waited for it to come on blu-ray. I didn't buy the extended cut that came out first because of the poor review on bluray.com When this edition came out with a great review for both audio and video content, I knew it was time to buy it. The special features on this anniversary edition are cool to. The price amazon had it listed at was definitely worth it."
5,Stargate Movie in BluRay,I was a bit concerned from a few of the other reviews but was blown away by the quality matched with such a low price on amazon. The image quality is breathtaking on our flat screen in 1080p. I also enjoyed thd many extras included. Highly recommened.
2,Out of sync,"Okay, what did I expect for $5.96, right? Both the theatrical and extended versions of this movie begin with the video and audio in sync, as they both progress, the synchronization gets so poor it vaporizes any enjoyment one might expect to have even on an inexpensive DVD. Would not recommend."
5,Well worth it,"This movie opend an entirely new genre of Stargate movies and TV shows. This is a classic SCI-FI movie and would appeal to any fans of ancient Egypt, ancient aliens, action, or history. It prompts a lot of thought while entertaining. Truly a nice movie to watch again and again.. Kurt Russell and James Spader are both excellent in this."
5,Stargate,This Bluray holds up well against modern sci-fi blockbuster movies. It was great in 1994 and it is still awesome.
4,"Great movie, even better service","This is a great movie, even if you just watch it to see James Spader in pre-Boston Legal days. The copy we received was defective and started skipping about halfway through the movie. I went on line, reported it as defective, and printed out the free return label. The replacement arrived the next day, before I had a chance to ship original. That's good service!I would have given this movie 5 stars except is seems to be incompatible with today's 6:9 wide screen TVs. No matter what display setting we chose, the image was compressed slightly from top to bottom, making people look short, and round things, like the Stargate, oval."
2,BLU-RAY review,"The Stargate Blu-Ray does not look good at all. I would only buy this on Blu-Ray if you do not own it on any other version, as it is only $10."
5,Stargate (Ultimate Edition),"Una de las mejores peliculas que he visto. Tiene un argumento muy novedoso pra los amantes de la ciencia ficcion, se puede ver reflejado en su secuela televisiva Stargate SG-1. La recomiendo ampliamente.Saludos."
4,Cleaner transfer,"Since this will be an anamorphic version, it should have a clearer picture and actually work with 16:9 screens. I'll pick it up for that reason as well as for a non-flip DVD. I think this movie is fantastic and well work a new version."
1,Bad bad bad,Both the extended and theatrical releases of this blu-ray freeze at chapter 21 this is a horrible experience which I see others have complained about.
5,Serving After 9/11 - The Firefighters' Story,"This film is an honest protrayal of one New York City firehouse and its fighterfighters doing their job and coping with their feelings a year after 9/11. The film brings us into the work day, the interactions between firefighters, their critique on the value of their service, and the choices they made and continue to make since 9/11. The film is honest and so finely edited that you lose the feeling of it being a documentary and feel like you're watching a good ""Indie"" movie about a firehouse and its men. I recommend ""Brotherhood"" to anyone interested in understanding why someone chooses this career and stays in it. It is grippingly honest, and draws the viewer into the life and mindset of these firefighters. By the end of it, you feel you know these guys, respect what they do, and want only to wish them well."
5,Amazing,All firefighters should see this move/documentary it takes you on a great ride with the FDNY and shows you the daily lives of everyone at the fire house its like a real life Rescue Me.it also takes you in depth of how the FDNY is dealing with 9/11 and everything that has come from it.I promise it will have you laughing crying and wanting to jump out of your seat to catch the next call.
4,Great Video,"Great video, follows the FDNY through actual tour of duty, from the firehouse to actual firefighting. If you are a firefighter, you will enjoy the realism of the vidio."
5,Julio en 'Tango',Julio doesn't have a great voice but he has that special tone that let you hear the music and the letter at the same time and enjoy them together. This CD have a very good selection of 'tangos argentinos' and even if you don't speak spanish you still can enjoy the music.
1,Pura Basura,"I have to agree with the reviewer who derided Iglesia's efforts at singing tango. I, too, like Iglesias' voice but this isn't tango-its the Hollywood Strings meets Burt Bacharach. The essence of tango is not at all here. Those who like lamed-down music will like this but please don't expect anything like this when you listen to honest renditions of the songs. There are many good versions of most of them, some not at all traditional- they are just not present on this album. One reviewer said you shouldn't expect a nightingale to sound like a hawk. I don't. But then I don't expect the nightingale to try the song of the hawk. If you really like tango, avoid this one for it is truly pura basura.Iglesias has embarrassed himself."
2,"Tango is Argentine, not Spanish","Tango is a music form Argentina and is sung with an Argentinian-spanish accent and Argentinian attitude. Julio's Spanish accent makes his attempt of interpreting tango laughable. If you know how tango should be sung, you'd laugh too. At least when Placido made a tango album, he used an Argentinian accent.Julio's not a bad singer, just not suited for tango at all."
5,Makes you happy just listening to it,This CD is very happy and romantic. I got it for Christmas the year it came out and play it frequently. Julio does his usual great job!
1,Tango,"Well, through no fault of Julio's, this turned into a bummer. I ordered a new tape and received a used one--but paid for the new one. I ordered Tango, and got the case for Tango, but another Julio tape, altogether, one that I already owned, inside. I know I could have returned it, but I was snowed in for a week. By then, I just shrugged it off. C'es la vie.S"
2,"Useful for new agers, but not for serious shamanic students","The only redeeming quality this book has is clearly explained rituals. But the downfall is the lack of background on WHY you should do them or why it matters. There is no philosophic system employed. I read it, but anyone with passing knowledge of shamanism will be bored on the initial flip-through."
2,Not worth it,"I purchased this study guide to review for the NTE's and foundthat it's not a study guide at all rather the whole book is just aseries of tests put together in no particular order and without page numbers. I found a number of wrong answers and contradictions in this book...The only thing working through the book did for me was generally let me know what types of material was going to be on it but even then, I would have to track down other sources to study from because this only gave answers to the questions without even explaining them. Try another study guide."
5,DVD much? Stake 3 Vamps With One Set...,"As long as they keep the prices cheaper than buying the sets individually, this is a fine way for fans of the show or newcomers to catch up on it. Having 3 DVD sets at once ensures, 18 discs of Joss Whedon's great spin off from Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Darker, and a bit more liberal when it comes to the whole demon thing, the show succeeds and stands on it's own. There are 66 episodes to watch...better be on vacation or sabatical!For those new to either Buffy or Angel, I suugest the seasons of Buffy as well. Watch the first 3 seasons of Buffy, then alternate Buffy Season 4 episode, Angel Season 1 episode, Buffy 4, Angel 1...as the shows at times do intertwine if you really want to be complete.Bottom line...great DVD's. The Angel sets have commentary on numerous episodes, and all the extras that the Buffy sets have been known for. Good stuff this."
3,"BtVS fan, get Angel dvds!","If you love Buffy the Vampire Slayer shows, then better get Angel dvds. Their stories were working together until Buffy's show ended. Warning: the last show of Angel wasn't gratify though. Very disappointed with WB to axe the show so soon."
2,Home Health and Rehab. review,This book is geared towards a PT or OT student who is taking a class involving home health. The information in the majority of chapters is general therefore this is not meant as a reference book for practicing therapists in the field. There are two chapters which are relevent. They include creative exercise and treatment ideas for the home.
3,100% what?,"As you will realize when you get them, 100% socks, not 100% cotton. However, cute socks, if your skin tolerates them."
2,PP&M Fans Beware,"Those who are familar with PP&M's 1960's recordings will be in for a shock. They sound nothing like they did on those old recordings. You can comment on the choice of fine social conscience songs, the solid instrumental accompaniment, but in the end it is the sound they make vocally that counts. And it is not pleasant. Remember, they made Bob Dylan famous with their moving, beautifully sung rendition of ""Blowin In The Wind"". It was as much how they sung as what they sung, that drew us to PP&M. No more. It is too painful for me to listen to."
3,Don't Think Twice - It's All Right,"Mary's voice has been shot for a long time already (about 500 miles ago) and now Peter's has become so soft it's like he's blowin' in the wind; but PP&M;'s harmony has surprisingly brought us a decent album. The song selection is quite superior to their previous one (Such is Love) which is what makes this recording good.Clearly the best song is the intricately arranged, ""Of This World"", but I can't help thinking how much better they would have done it 40 years ago. This album contains a much improved version of, ""Don't Laugh At Me"" that finally does some justice to that hauntingly beautiful tune. Other songs such as, ""Some Walls"", ""Wayfaring Stranger"", ""The Great Storm is Over"", are good typical PP&M; songs that only they do so well. The opening medley of union songs ain't too bad if you can stomach the corn.Thankfully, Mary only sings one solo.If you enjoy PP&M; buy this album."
2,mary can't hold a tune anymore,I read the reviews before I bought this album and I wish I had paid more attention to them. Mary's voice is very harsh now; the only songs on this album that you can listen to are the ones where she is drowned out by Peter and Paul
5,Still Good!,"My parents introduced me to these artists when I was young and I still love the music they dish out. By far, my favorite song on this album is ""Some Walls"" but I like all the songs. Not only are they wonderfully performed and written but each carries a powerful message! A Definite Must-Buy"
3,Relaxing Workout,"Eva Bondar presents a fairly low impact workout that moves at a very slow pace. Even though you are not working at a fast pace you can feel the exercises working. This workout begins in a seated position and then moves into back, neck and leg stretches. Each stretching exercise properly prepares the body for more intense exercises. The exercises presented include: mermaid, single-leg pull, bridge, scissors and curls (sit-ups). The back exercises include: cat/cow and cobra. There is a relaxing child's pose and then a downward dog and hanging forward bend. As you can see from the short list of exercises this moves at a slow pace and emphasis is placed on doing the exercises with a sense of precision. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is advanced but maybe it will work for intermediates and beginners. The deep breathing throughout is relaxing and the sound of the waves in the background make this a very soothing workout.~The Rebecca Review"
3,a little too slow,"This is a very easy, slow going video. Not quite what I hoped for, but probably good if you are just starting out with exercise tapes."
2,A good come-on but not much follow through,"Some of the sites are informative -- for instance, if you are doing academic or ""serious"" research, the search engines, etc. provided are great. But as far as real ""spy"" stuff, there's not much new between the covers here."
3,Overpowering Honey Toffee Scent...,"I usually enjoy Lush's honey fragrances, but MA BAR's scent is overwhelming (maybe it's the cocoa powder). MA BAR turns the water a beige color (again - probably the cocoa powder) and it makes mounds of bubbles.If you find the other honey scents too subtle for you MA BAR may create the perfect bath."
4,Smells deliciously of Honey I Washed the Kids Soap,"This bubble bar smells fantastic, a gorgeous honeyed toffee scent that is enjoyable to many people and older kids would like (bubble baths aren't great for kids under six as it can irritate their urethras).There is a cute brown sugar cube in it that dissolves in the water, and half is a chocolatey (brown) Honey I Washed the Kids toffee scent and half is the regular toffee scent. It turns the water a light shade of cola and makes masses of bubbles.With most bubble bars I recommend using half, because the scents are lovely and strong and you get loads of bubbles from half, but with this one, the scent kind of died down in the bath and didn't linger on my skin very well, so I think you do need to use a whole one to get the full effect.I love this scent, and I am glad they make the scent in a bath bomb (Honey Bee) as well as in this bubble bar."
2,Poo brown,"I adore Lush products and was very excited to try this bubble bar as it smelled so yummy.First off, I barely got any bubbles and I used the enitre thing!Second, the smell was so faint that even with my nose an inch from the water, I couldn't smell it.Third, the bar turned the water a nasty shade of poopy brown.All in all the worst Lush product I have ever used. Very disappointed."
5,Very cute,My friend is a Tinkerbell addict. She will love this as a Christmas present. Can't wait to see her face. This came quickly and is just as advertised. Another great purchase from Amazon.
4,Pretty good,It does take some efforts and strengths to put on the steering wheel. But it does provide a good grip and isolation from coldness and hotness. No odor at all. Recommended.
3,Buyer beware: You need patience for this item,"I'm not sure i'd recommend it because you need serious patience when applying it. After all is said and done, it's fine. But it is a MAJOR pain to put it on. It took me probably about 30 minutes to do it. If you have the patience then go ahead but be aware that it might hurt your hands, it hurt mine.it's also not the softest thing, holding it when driving - the designs stick out and are a little rough. but i've been using it for almost a year, so it does seem to be fairly durable."
5,tip for getting the cover on,"this is really tight and hard to get over the steering wheel, but here's a tip, leave it in the car on a hot day and it will stretch a little and slip right over"
1,Stallone stinks up the joint,"You would think with the cast and 1940s Hell's Kitchen setting this movie would've been atleast semi-decent. Not even close. This was such a stinkbomb I eventually shut it off. The plot's about three Italian-American brothers from the West Side trying to get out of their hood. One wrestles, the other promotes him, another is a sleaze, blah blah. Stallone's performance as Cosmo Carboni is so horrendous you have to see it to believe it. Even several scenes that could have been good, i.e. a crew of Irish thugs from the neighborhood (lead by awesome Kevin Conway btw, who does his best with the awful script as does Assante) taunting the Italian brothers leading to long and grueling arm-wrestling match to settle the beef, are incredibly painful to watch. A few cards short of a full deck, this movie will make you want to fall asleep or throw your TV out the window.1 star"
1,Stallone at his worst,Don't waste your time or even $1.99!! Stallone at his worst! Terry Funk was the only bright spot. Rent Rambo instead!
2,Annoyance in a Big Way (Sylvester)!,"For starters, I can't believe Sylvester Stallone tried to sing in this movie. Surely he knew he was a horrible vocalist, which is putting it lightly. For that reason, I almost turned to another channel. My main reason for attempting to watch this picture, was because of Armand Assante. He's one of my favorite actors and thought it may be an okay picture to watch. Sylvester was annoying and hogged the picture at times. As some have said, it seemed as though a little bit of, ""Rocky"" came into play.On that note, I did not get to enjoy watching Armand for the distraction of Sylvester who in my opinion, talked too much in this movie. I do like a lot of Sylvester's movies, but this one did not do it for me. I'am giving it a two-star, because of Armand's presence."
1,Adam Mfg Co Grn Low Back Chair Resin Patio Chairs,The chairs are not very strong too much flexible ; so only kids could seat on them.I'm not sure they could be enough strong for an adult.I was really desappointed if I kept them it was because it's very difficult to send back!!! I'll never buy again.
1,You must be joking---Must be a price error,"This chair is not even worth $35 much less $352. Got to be a joke or pricing error.Hey Amazon, try proofreading your ads!"
1,You've GOT to be kidding.......,What's up with the price on this? I can pick it up for less than $8 at the dollar store...........hey buddy - fix your errors.
5,Soothing and nostalgic,"Hawai'i One Summer is a slim collection of luminous essays reflecting diversal topics ranging from surfing to house chores. Indeed, this is the least read book by Hong-Kingston. Her prose is clear and evocative. It is very different from the radical Woman Warrior. It evokes a zen quality, like sipping a soulful cup of ginseng tea."
4,Starret Calpiper Holster,"Came in good timing, packaged nicely in a Starret box. It has a belt loop snap-button deal on it, which is nice but I wish it would have had a clip instead/ass well. Overall a good product, worth the price when you're using $200+ tools."
1,"Was good in 2000, but now incredibly out of date- don't buy!","Don't buy this book! It was decent in 2000, but after six years, it is almost criminal that the book is still sold. Since this book was published, GTK+ has gone through 5 complete new revisions (from 1.4 to 2.8, with 2.10 due out in the next few weeks) and nearly every API has changed. Buy the Official GNOME 2 Developer's Guide instead- it isn't spectacularly up to date either (it is based on gtk 2.4), but it is at least in the right ballpark."
1,one of those user un-friendly books.,"This is one of those reader unfriendly books. For example, the book only gives a small segment of the code. The author then indicates in many occasions that this code segment is from xxx.c but does not say where the xxx.c is. In some occasions, the author says ""this segment of code is from xxx.c (available from the website)"" but does not spit out which website. I found in one occasion (p489) the author finally says this code segment is from fixed.c (found on this book's accompanying Web site) but still does not spit out the Web address. I eventually found the web address at the very back of the book. The author certainly knows how to torture the readers who paid $40 for that book!"
2,Riddled with typos,"After I read the glowing reviews of this book, I was very excited to go to the store and pick up a copy of it. When I sat down with it and started reading it, I couldn't believe the glaring number of typos, editing errors, and formatting problems this book had! If only someone had proofread this book before it was sent out, this could have been avoided completely. From the 100 or so pages I browsed, there was at least one error every 3 pages or so.This is the second time that I have bought a very poorly edited book from Sams (the first being Teach Yourself Emacs in 24 Hours, which isn't even fit to toss in your fireplace). Although the content of the book and the organization seems deceny (which is why I gave this book 2 stars), I will never ever buy a Sams book again for the mere fact that I don't feel I am getting quality for my money. I think I'll stick to O'Reilly instead.v"
5,A Real Goody,"Years ago, Iwalked into a local club to listen to this band. Never heard them before. Afterwards. I thought they were as exciting as any blues band I'd ever heard. And that night, he'd only one guitarist with him. I immediately picked up this tape (in those days, it was either cassette or LP). Much to my pleasure, he had two great guitarists with him, plus a fine bass and drum section, probably the same ones that I'd heard before. This band was not only more exciting than the one I'd heard, but tighter as well. And then there were those excellent vocals and harmonica playing. Imagine my pleasure at seeing this out on CD, with extra cuts besides. I eagerly await even more, if possible."
4,Not bad doesn't feel like lipstick!,In don't like to wear lipstick because it feels funny and gets on things this is a good compromise.
1,AWFUL,"This is the WORST lip ""stain"" EVER. It transfers itself to your teeth when you smile; and God forbid you lick your lips because it will come right off. Don't even think about eating or drinking with this stuff on. I do not recommend it at ALL. I thought it would be a good lip stain because the Line & Seal eyeliner REALLY lasts a long time. Anyway, spend your 8 dollars elsewhere. You're wasting your money if you buy this product. You would have better luck with a red permanent marker."
5,The Evolution of a State (Noah Smithwick),A detailed and authentic account of the period by a very hardy pioneer.Noah Smithwick was a survivor and on top of his game. I note there is a town named after him NW of Austin. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in frontier Texas.
3,"A good read, but use with caution","Dictated to one of his daughters when he was well past eighty, Noah Smithwick witnessed the panorama of Texas History. From the early days of Austin's Colony to the the aftermath of the Civil War, the text is lively with a dry sense of humor. But the reader is urged to use this book with caution. Some facts don't match up with other documents that were written at the time, instead of years later. (Noah had been banished from Texas in a round-about way. He had made a rifle and loaned it to another settler, who promptly used it to commit a murder.) Smithwick seemed to posess a fair education, which on the Texas frontier was something of an accomplishment. Blacksmith, carpenter, tobacco smuggler, gunsmith, racontour par excellance and even somewhat of a romantic, Smithwick's book is well worth reading."
5,An Excellent Memoir,"I learned of this book through the H-Texas History forum online and I was not disappointed. Occasional ""old time"" expressions make the account interesting and remind the reader that the writer is speaking from another time. The story as told from a first-person point of view was enhanced by my prior knowledge of events in Texas history. Reading about those events in the words of a person who was there was impressive. I highly recommend this book. I have purchased copies as gifts."
3,Historical type book - hubby likes it,"I got this for my hubby to read. He is a fan of the History Channel so I thought this would be good for him. He likes it but told me he is more interested in the history of WWI and WWII. Oh well, I tried."
2,not the track I wanted,"The music was ok . . . I prefer the instrumentals to the vocal pieces. The reason for the low rating is only that the expected version of Liberte is not included on the CD, and you can't really tell that from the online preview."
3,Just Average,Reading the previous reviews I thought this would be a super CD. Nothing better than average.
3,"Good, but not for paths","I got these lights to use for relatively narrow paths between gardens in our back yard. They are unobtrusive in daylight and very attractive at night--if looked at from a distance. Problem is, they are blinding when looked down on from above. This feature--no caps or covers--makes them unsuitable, even hazardous, when trying to use them to guide one's way in the dark. I returned them and got the bollard type, which are equally unobtrusive but have caps on top."
4,Great for lighting trees and bushes,"These are not intended for pathway lighting. Although I bought them for along my driveway, as someone else mentioned they are not very effective. I have fairly large trees and bushes along one side of my 300' drive so I placed them at the base of the trees and bushes and the results are great. The tree trunks and lower branches are highlighted and we are happy with the results. Perhaps the package should suggest the lighting pattern but looking at the construction, the domed globe is obviously intended to focus upward rather than horizontally. These are very well built lights and I am ordering more today to add to the string."
3,Stroller was not harmed,I bought the bag for an airplane trip. The bag was absolutely destroyed in handling by the airline employees. I checked the bag at the gate and by the first deplane the bag was all ripped. I am happy to say however that the stroller was not harmed. I believe the stroller would have taken the beating if not for the bag.I have the Graco Quatro stroller which fit perfectly in the bag. I was traveling alone and it was easy enough to open the bag leaving it flat on the ground and roll the stroller onto it while in the extended position then collapse onto the bag. The wheels were helpful in making it easy to pull even with a baby in one arm and the bag in the other. It did tend to tip if I didn't keep it in the correct position.I feel the bag was worth the money for an airplane trip as it helped to not harm my stroller and was easy to pull. I took the bag to the airline luggage claim and they are reimbursing me for the damage. I will repurchase the bag for my next trip.
1,POOR POOR BAG,"This bag fell apart after the first flight and we gate checked! I duct taped it to limp home, but if you have a sturdy stroller, go for a sturdy bag, THIS IS NOT IT!"
2,Twice Sold Tales,"I purchased this cd some time ago....played it partially....couldn't get through the whole thing.....VERY BLAND & not very good.....so I decided to sell it on Amazon.com in my Marketplace Store. AND guess who bought it??? SID, HIMSELF. Why (I didn't know at the time)....until I got a chargeback from Visa. I notified him when it was shipped & had tracked the cd & it proved that he got it. I asked him ""why the chargeback"" & why he didn't notify me if there was a problem.....but I guess he was ""too kool"" to answer. Visa gave him his money back......so now he has the cd to re-sell again AND his money. (I could understand, if it had been a promo, but it wasn't....it was purchased with my money..it was mine to sell.) For anyone going to do business with him....I would be very cautious....he is a dishonest person....as well as a poor recording artist."
2,Give it Another Try,"When I first wrote my review for this disc, I panned it. Recently, I've given it another go, and I have to say that this isn't such a bad little compilation after all. I still don't have too much interest in the blood-guts-and-butts humor of ""An Old Story,"" ""Maakies"" or ""Cane Toad,"" but the disc also includes some fascinating work like Patrick Smith's ""Drink,"" Mo Willems' ""Iddy Biddy Beat Boy,"" Pjtor Sapegin's ""One Day a Man Bought a House,"" and Raimund Krumme's ""Ropedancers."" ""Stubble Trouble"" is quick and humorous, and with The World's Best Animation DVD out of print, it's nice to see the German film ""Balance"" available for a new generation of artists.So, Spike and Mike, I take back some of what I said before. While I still prefer your previous release, ""Spike and Mike's Classic Festival of Animation,"" I appreciate the effort in putting some very unique animations on one very affordable disc. Here's looking forward to an even better compilation in the future!"
2,pretty wennie !!,I thought this tape was overall good. But in my point of view Balanceand Ropedancers were in pretty bad verson. Possible because of being over 20 years old. I give this 2stars because of that and there's no special features on this dvd. That's strange because almost every spike and mike dvds has aleast 2 or more speical features the only speacial feature is a short that doesn't end. This might possibly be the worst dvd of spike and mike ever made. If it was up to me I would get the spike and mike vhs tapes or the sick and twisted festival.
1,Pressure opened it,It came to me already opened. I toss it in the garbage. I won't be buying these kind of products online.
3,So So Product.,"I have tried the beef and chicken flavors. Both were very good. This one tastes more like a tinny fish stock. Not bad, mind you, but doesn't taste much like lobster - and if eaten as a plain broth - not good at all.Highly recommend the Chicken and Beef but I doubt I'll buy the Lobster again."
1,No Lobster Flavor,"I bought this to try and shortcut a lobster stew recipe. It was horrible. It is so salty all you can taste is salt - like the tinny salt taste in canned soup. I read the reviews about the sodium content, but figured I would compensate with the other ingredients in the recipe. I put no other salt in the stew, and still all I could taste was salt - but more importantly, no lobster flavor whatsoever. It was worth a shot, I guess, but I will throw the rest out."
2,"Over priced, not the best picture, touch isn't that acurate",Works with windows 7/8. That's about the only pro I have. I wish I would have just spent an extra $40 and got a nexus7 and just ran an RDP session to my PC.
5,Excellent alternative history! H. Beam Piper would be proud.,"This is a very rare book,There are a very few Alternative histories novels which approach the feel of this novel. It is a sequel to ""Lord Kalvan Of Otherwhen"" by H. Beam Piper. I feel it is just as good or maybe better than the original."
5,A terrific read that i want to read again,A sequel that is in many ways better than the original. I lost my copy and am desperate to get another! I would love to see a third book as a follow on to this one.
3,A DVD to Listen,"If you're a real Iron Maiden fan, you'll love this DVD but unfortunately you won't be able to see anything, unfortunately it was filmed by ""KIDS"" on Kid's style, with more than 10 moving cameras which NEVER stay still for more than a fraction of a sec. zooming in and out and twisting 90D, impossible to see a thing. 3 stars for the producers for release such a pour video and 1/2 star for the camera crew."
4,Paul dianno still the man,"I personally think paul dianno is a better singer than bruce dickinson. Its is true paul brought an punk rock element to metal, but it just made it that much more unique. in this dvd, i feel pual could have done better on the vocla son some parts, but overall did very well. dianno has gotten bigger and meaner than the 80's maiden frontman, in music and looks. If it ever came to a fist fight between bruce and paul, paul would defintely have the upper hand."
1,cologne,returned this product over a month ago still not seen a credit. Make sure you buy the correct product. Cause Amazon takes there sweet time in crediting your account if you don't.....
3,ehhhh,"at first i loved this perfume, but after a while it gets to you. now when i spray it, i get this massive headache. its too flowery for my taste."
5,"I put this on, I get laid... Nuff said",The title of this review pretty much sums up what I think of it. It's effing amazing. I wore this on me and my fiancee's first date. Notice how she's my fiancee now. Trust me guys the ladies will be all over you with this stuff. GET IT!!
5,A favorite of mine...,"""Tommy Girl"" is one of the scents I adore. It has a crisp, clean smell (like someone who's freshly showed) to it. The description mentions flowery, but I think it almost has a citrus like smell to it. Very nice for day-wear."
5,High School.,I use to were this stuff in High School and I still love it. Saw a good price for it and Im glad I got some more.
3,"Rent, don't buy.","This is a quirky, throw-away joke comedy along the lines of ""Dude, wheres my car?"" or ""Pootie-Tang"". It has it's funny moments, but it tends to slug along with witless minority humor and seemingly pointless sub-plots. It can get pretty over the top. John Leguizamo gives a bad good performance. He flawlessly captures the pure essence of an annoying and crazy character. This is essentially a ""chase"" movie. The premise is somewhere along the lines of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" but it takes the idea of a bored hunter hunting humans in a whole new and strange direction. This is a fun movie to see maybe once or twice with your friends but it has little value aside from that."
5,Ace ventura on speed!,Im mostly into hilariously comedy movies like any of mel brooks's movies and this is far my most favorite movie. John leguizamo was a laughing riot of bugs bunny in this movie who will make alot of people laugh out loud til they cry and jefferey jones was more like elmer fudd even the plot is so wacky AKA bugs bunny meets ace ventura.If your into wacky movies like ace ventura then this movie is for you.
5,THE PEST,"I bought the movie because my 13yr old daughter thinks this movie is very funny. I also bought it for our dvd player. I watched it with her, and it's not a bad movie, i call it stupid funny humour."
2,"Funny, you say?!? Eau contraire!","I find it hard to believe anyone thinks this movie is funny. John Leguizamo was much funnier in ""To Wong Fu..."" and appears here as just silly, childish, and seeking attention in unfunny, overly hyperactive ways. The only redeeming feature of this flick is the character Himmel (played by Edoardo Ballerini), son of the villain Jeff Jones (who is in about every movie ever made). 70% of the 5 or 6 good jokes in this movie are his.All in all, don't waste your money. But if you are in the mood for some stupid slapstick and don't mind having your intelligence compromised and insulted every few minutes, go for it."
5,The Funniest I Have Seen from John L.,"Just when I thought he could not get any funnier he proves me wrong again! I cannot remember laughing as hard or as often as I did with this flick. This slapstick comedy show-cases the huge comedic talents and energy of John Leguizamo. Combined with a great cast and story, this is a must see to appreciate. Can't imagine how he can top this one, don't know if I could survive it. Two thumbs up!!!"
2,read my review for an honest opinion,"actually, this was my fav. movie, but i saw it 6 times, so now its a BORE!! but...if your only planning on viewing it once then i guess its ok. Basicly, its slow. No action. No FUNNY comedy. No Romance. No believable violence. You are never on the tip of your chair when you watch this movie. In fact-it really shouldn't have even been created. Its an embarassment to all of the funny, ""slap-stick"" humor out there. Thank you for spending your time reading this, you owe it to yourself to NOT buy this movie."
1,the dumbest excuse of a movie i ever saw,this was dumb. the only good scene was the kareoke bar where he sang.
5,OMG its been ages and i got to still love this movie,This is one of the worlds greatest comedy movies.I watched it once in 97 and now i just cant stop thinking about all the jokes which still make me laughgod if you have any sence of humor.... get this movie
3,The Pest Rules!,"Just got finished watching it, and I gotta tell you, it is hilarious. Fast pased plot, and constant jokes make this one of the greatest comedies ever. It's a rather unknown flick, but it is still a great one. The main character comes off as annoying though. Buy or rent today."
2,Not the best movie,I didn't really enjoy this movies. It's not something I would want to watch again. It didn't really fit into what I enjoy.
2,Frustrated!,When I received the movie I had to try 3 different DVD players to get it to play. Which then made me think the movie was an illegal copy! I wish there was a way to tell if it what I got is real or a fake!!!
1,The Pest...you're damn right it is.,"This movie ought to be shot. Not once. Not twice. But thrice. Hopefully right through that darn obnoxious target that has been so conviently placed. John Leguizamo can do better than this! I mean, remember that show...on Fox...with the minorities...no not In Living Color...the other one...with John Leguizamo...yeah that one, John was in that! Why can't he go back anddo that again! He could just sneak it by Fox's censors by calling it ""World's Most Dangerous Latino Comdians 7."""
1,What is wrong with you people?,"How could you enjoy this movie? How? I mean, I know little known films like this are more likely to get reviewed by fans, but seriously? 5-stars? This film is horrible. If you're brain-dead, but not racist, you'll be offended. If you're racist, but not brain-dead, you'll be bored and annoyed out of your mind.Here's a good test: Could you sit in front of a TV and watch 2 hours of old bigoted cartoons that they don't show anymore and be amused? If yes, get this movie. If not, avoid at all costs."
2,2 1/2 stars. The movie's plot... wait a minute... what plot,"This movie has the worst plot line ever, which is barely even there. Most of the time if a movie has no plot I don't give above a 1, but this movie is quite funny and if you're not looking for anything to hold you to the movie fine. It's like watching Adam Sandler's Happy Gilmore with about 1/10 of the plot. This movie is not one you will want to watch over and over (more than likely) so rent it before you buy."
1,It sucked,I think John Liguizamo is very annoying. The beginning and the end is especially annoying when he is singing in the shower. It had a stupid plot and just kept getting crappier and crappier.
3,mario pull backs,"My son was happy with the toy. I myself, thought the price was a bit steep for the actual toy.They are very small and cheaply made."
4,A Very Nice Basic Collection,"This is a great basic collection of Native American motifs. All images are black and white, as is indicated in the product description. The printed images provided in the book are true to size and of very high quality. Each image is identified with tribe name of origin and organized regionally. The easy-to-navigate CD, which requires no program installation, provides each image in several different file formats, including .GIF, .JPG, .TIF, .BMP and others. Because there is quite a wide variety of tribal motifs covered, there are only a handful of images from each tribe, but as an overview and basic collection, I would highly recommed it."
2,Professional Artists and Craftsmen BEWARE!,"This art is NOT for the art or crafts professional! The clip art in this book is so crudely drawn, it could only have been created by an amateur, and certainly one with no interest in the subject or pride in the resulting product.Since the art is copyright-protected and can't be used for resale items or commercial projects, a more sensible solution, at least for the professional, is to buy licensed stock art from a microstock photo web site. Not cheap, but if time is money, a professional will spend hours reworking THIS stuff just to make it marginally usable."
1,Don't waste your money.,"The CD is very difficult to navigate. The ""clip art"" is not really clip art, but just copies of what's in the book, so you can't really use it on posters, flyers, etc. I had envisioned all these wonderful, colorful motifs that I could use for my various projects, however, this CD only has small black and white photos of some not-so-authentic motifs, if you will. I am disappointed."
4,Worthy Buy,"I really liked this version of Rigoletto a lot, it has all kinds of commitment and passion.Il Trovatore - not so much, I don't really care for it but it's a good companion piece."
4,Samsara By Guerlain For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Oz.,"This Samsara By Guerlain For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 1.7. very nice, My more people all like the Light fragrance Eau De Parfum Spray."
2,This book romanticizes mental illness; style is irritating.,"This book romanticizes mental illness in its quest to emulate Joycean prose. Dense, illogical monologues are unrelieved by dialogue, action, or time orientation. The effect is about as interesting as listening to someone explain their dreams in detail. Undisciplined, reads like a good first draft. Language is sloppy and cliched. All it needs to be more irritating is the addition of footnotes."
5,"007 dvd ""golden eye""",I am very pleased with the purchase of this dvd. It took only a few days for delivery and the movie of course is as always excellent. I am a fan of 007 and if there are anymore of these 007 dvd's available at this seller I will purchase them. I recommend this seller to all that need a dvd in a timely manner.
3,I can only give it a 3 of 5,"I thought it was a very silly plot, and really, really disliked the Russian hacker."
4,The best Bond movie ever?,"In my opinion this is the definitive James Bond movie. It has everything a Bond movie is supposed to have, with Sean Bean thrown in there as a bonus!Pierce Brosnan is perfectly suave, pithy, and tough in this, his first role as double 0 agent James Bond.This, and Casino Royale are, in my opinion, the best Bond film since The Spy Who Loved Me."
5,Golden Eye 007,Item was shipped and received in an expediant manner. Packaged in near perfect condition as promised. No complaints. 5 STARS.
2,Bond's lost his touch!,"I am one of Bond's biggest fans so I can't really believe the rating I'm giving this movie. It all started when one of my friends said this was the best movie ever. I went right away and bought it, and boy was I dissapointed. The only good part was Tina Turner's song. Another bad thing was having Xenia in there. All she does is a bunch of sick noises, etc. The plot also really stunk. Either rent, or just don't see it at all."
1,Faulty DVD,"The DVD upon receipt was missing 40% of the end of the Movie. If you started the Movie in ""scene selection"" - then you could view the entire Movie. I would have liked that someone @ Amazon.com had completed some form of quality control before shipping the item to me. I am a huge fan of the James Bond series of Movies and was looking forward to adding to my Movie Collection. This is my first experience with Amazon.com and I am now reticent to purchase again with them."
3,Goldfinger was better,"For a film that resurrected the longest running movies series after a six year dormancy, it is a good start. Brosnan does bring a more serious edge to his character, started most recently by Timothy Dalton. Brosnan's portrayal lacks the casual competency that Connery brought to the role, best seen when he settled into the character in Goldfinger. The film does succeed in bringing the Bond formula into the 1990s, and is mostly fast paced. The film continues the regretable ploy of substituting gadgets for plot development.What the Bond series needs is a return to a fast-paced, edge of the seat lo-tech thriller like From Russia With Love, as a refreshing alternative to all the gadget - filled spy thrillers on the market."
3,NEW BOND BROSNAN,"Not a bad movie. The special effects and story are okay, and it is a good first effort at the bond role by Brosnan. One of the few flaws of the movies was the traditional BMW, which was hardly shown off by Bond (this was heavily made up for it Tomorrow Never Dies). Another disappointment was that there were only two Bond girls, and he only slept with one of them. All in all not a bad movie, and it is worth watching."
3,THE WORST OF THE BOND FILMS!,"Although it has some great action sequences and some fine-looking Bond women, this entry is the worst. I liked it in theaters, but its very dull. Skip this one. ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and ""The World is Not Enough"" are better, Grade: C-"
2,Careful with supposed HD quality,"Movie - GoodQuality of HD video = awful!!! I do want a refund, but I was not able to find where to as for it. Quality was worst that VHS."
4,the Best James Bond Movie,"The first time Pierce Brosnan played the legendary agent 007 was in 1995's ""Goldenye"" In this explosive action packed mission James with the help of a russian computer programmer battles a russian general, a fellow agent turned betrayer & a seductress assasin in Cuba for a space weapon. Terrific 007 entertainment, still the best James Bond movie, the supporting cast is terrific too & I'm excited see Daniel Craig as James Bond in ""Casino Royale"" the movie about James' first mission"
5,Best Movie Ever,"This is the single greatest James Bond movie. It is lots of fun and is Bond at his best. Bond, Bond James Bond."
4,Why Didn't They Get Brosnan Sooner??,"Bond has been away from the big screen for 6 years before this movie, and now he's back, and he's great! This movie is more like 4-and-a-half stars...I didn't want to give it 5 stars, because it's not as good as ""Goldfinger,"" but I don't think anything ever will be, so this is a close, VERY close second. Pierce Brosnan is great as 007, I can't figure out why they didn't get him sooner, they could've gotten him, instead they got Dalton, who in my opinion, didn't make a good James Bond at all. This movie has a great opening sequence, which serves as a primer for the great action to come. Sean Bean is great as 006, Onatopp's character is good, as well as Natalya Simonova's. This movie has a great plot as well, I don't want to give it away, because there are a lot of surprises. So, in conclusion, this is a great movie, and a renaissance for the james Bond series,... BUY THIS MOVIE!!"
5,2nd Best Bond movie,"This is the next best Bond movie after Tomorrow Never Dies, but it has the best musical score out of any Bond movie. The composer, Eric Serra, should score another Bond movie in the future."
1,"Farewell, Mr. Bond","After Tina Turner growls the tuneless title song, the movie begins with Pierce Brosnan's James Bond getting away in his Aston-Martin with yet another luscious babe... only now, in the politically correct '90s, she puts him down for his smoking, drinking, and womanizing. Sean Connery would have given her the ejector seat, but poor Pierce just sits there and makes his standard I've-just-bitten-a-lemon face. It only gets more incomprehensible as this pathetic, pure plastic attempt at a Bond movie grinds on."
4,Bond for the new World,"Before this movie, most Bond films had to do with the cold war. In previous movies, he drove Aston Martins, and M was a guy. Now, the cold war is over, BMWs are his vehicle, and the new M is played by Judi Dench in one of the best 007 movies ever. It is about how Bond must save the world from a deadly satelite weapon in the hands of Janus, the leader of a crime syndacate. But when Bond learns of Janus's true identity, the film goes off in a whole new direction. This is a wonderful film, but the one flaw is that he doesn't use ANY of the gadgets in his new car, and in all the other films, he uses every one. All in all, this is a great movie, and if you are a fan of action/adventure, you don't want to miss this one."
5,Things blowing up...typical 007 movie,"I bought this used on Amazon. I like watching 007 movies, specially Pierce Brosnan ones. There is technology, humor, things blowing up, all that you need in a 007 movie. For $5, it was worth the purchase with free shipping :)"
2,Was it a spoof of James Bond Movies?,Dreadful. Anybody who thinks Pierce Brosnan is the best 007 should be shot at dawn! Obviously Connery is the best. Now I'm sorry but not even Sean Bean can survive a 200-foot drop from a satellite dish - and not even 007 can skydive into a plane! I can understand that Bond is the best and so some of the stunts are unbelievable but this is a bit much. Tomorrow never dies is much better.
5,One of the Best Bond films ever,"This is certainly one of the best Bond films, alongside Thunderball. The acting is superb, and Pierce Brosnan is definetly the best Bond since Connery. Overall, if you're into Bond flicks, lotsa action, and some romance, get this movie!"
5,Kick-ass James Bond film!,"To be honest, this is my favorite James Bond film ever made! I have seen pretty much all of them, and I have to say, this one beats all the rest. It's classic James Bond, if not with a little more brains than the other ones. The acting is first-rate, and we have several talented actors like Pierce Brosnan, Sean Bean, Alan Cumming, and others. The action is superbly choreographed, and Martin Campbell's directing is excellent. The quips by Bond are as good as ever, and you really enjoy watching him nail the bad guy. I am sad that thsi same director Martin Campbell is one of the people influencing all these new changes in the franchise (Daniel Criag as Bond?), but I still appreciate this film done by him."
5,This movie will blow your mind,"This movie rocks, starting with the jump off the bridge. Then there is the motorcycle-to-plane, while keeping the same bond wit, that hasn't been seen since connory. I really like how it ends and how the girl isn't a bimbo(seeing bond as a man who can't do everything and has emotions really turned this movie in to a keeper). I also believe the plot setting is up there with ""goldfinger"". I think that the chase near the beginning could have been better but what are you going to do. The evil girl getting pleasure from killing was a nice touch and having a pretty realistic plot, made the story line flow that much more easily. The female and incredible gadgets add for a few surpries that you don't see in other bond flicks. Go rent/buy this movie as soon as you can!"
5,Goldeneye,this is a great movie. I just love pierce bronson and his nice tank wihich he uses to destroy many things in the movie. The ending is the best part (I will tell you it because I know you want to see it so I'll give it away) When he stops the golden eye from hitting London and killing many people. Then he kilss the main bad guy by pushing him off this needle and he hits the bottom of the satelite.
5,But does it have the 10 + trailers / TV spots ???,If so I'm picking up (yet again) this latest 007 thriller. From the sounds of it they've taken all the cool features from the laserdisk and transferred them over to DVD. Can anyone confirm that all these trailers / spots are on the new DVD?
5,Bond Proves Worthy of The 90's,"Pierce Brosnan's debut as James Bond 007 is excellent. It grabs the viewer immediately, as Brosnan,and Sean Bean are faced with Gottfried John's Colonel Ouromov. Of course, Bond comes out victorious, and we hear the theme belted out by Tina Turner. Then nine years later, we find 007 up to his usual tricks. He then meets Xenia Onatopp, our femme fatale, who always enjoys a good squeeze. M is portrayed by Dame Judi Dench, who is excellent. The movie then carries us to Cuba, where 006 is plotting world-wide fianancial meltdown via the computer. Bond, of course, defeats his onetime ally, saves the world, and gets the girl. All of the usual elements are added to make this a fine Bond film, with all the right stuff."
4,Good Movie - Even Better Game,"Stunning special effects, great music, a good plot line, and mind-boggling stunts all pull together to form, in my opinion, one of the greatest Bond movies yet. 'GoldenEye' ranks right up there with 'Thunderball' and 'Dr. No'. Although many seem to be bashing on Brosnan and his acting talents, he plays the Bond role much better than others have made it sound. Brosnan especially has a knack for keeping the classic Bond-Q sarcasm. He also does a great job interacting with M.One of the few flaws in this movie was the absence of Bond's traditional cars. He has a BMW in the movie, but never really shows it off. (Note that this is heavily made up for in Tomorrow Never Dies)All in all, one of the better Bond movies. My suggestion: buy it."
3,A mixed bag,"This film has many different components.Some work,some don`t.First:The soundtrack is horrible.Second:Brosnan doesn`t give a perfect performance,but he is great,and has a lot of screen presence.Bean is one of the better Bond-villains,but the plot is absurd.How did 006 and Ouromov set up 006 death?That`s never explained.Janssen deserves credit for giving a great performance,she overplays her role in a wonderful way."
4,One of the better Bond movies.,"Even so, the female villain is too kinky, and neither Pierce Brosnan nor anybody else nobody beats Sean Connery as Bond."
5,IT WAS OSSEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I realy liked the movie brosnan is definetly the best james bond
5,A treat for Sean Bean fans -- and the best Bond Girl ever!,"Yes, yes, I know that Pierce Brosnan ""stars"" in this as James Bond ... but the movie is completely and utterly stolen by Sean Bean, who snarks, smirks, and sexes his way through every scene he's in. Whether he's dressed for a fight in all black, or dressed to kill in a suit, the man's just pure sexy. British financial system, who needs it? I'd go away with him any day of the week; Bond, James ... who?As an added bonus, this movie also has my favorite Bond Girl ever; Izabella Scorupco's Natalya Semyonova, who is considerably smarter (except for her taste in men) than Bond himself; she also saves Bond's life almost as much as she saves his -- though she's not a trained agent a la Wai Lin or Jinx, just a brave, smart, tough everywoman."
1,James Bond for Idiots,"Brosnan has the right look and the teaser sequence is fun. That being said, this is a big expensive nothing with no suspense or sense of Ian Fleming. It's a generic action picture with a brand name attached."
1,Dissapionting!!!,There's no kiding here this is a Bond moovie. Does anybody know who planed this awful 007 moovie? 90% borring. Good for a moovie but doesn't bring back any of the action that Roger Moore had.
1,Exellent plot BUT TERRIBLE James Bond-actor...,"This movie has a great plot, good villains, nice stunts and so on(great Bond girls of course)... The ONLY THING that makes this movie all go wrong is the fact that bringing that stupid and weak actor Brosnan to the role! How in the world do you bring such as nice and serious actor like Dalton, and then bring this awful actor to the role? He gives nothing but SHAME to the James Bond Charachter! If it wouldn`t for Brosnan, i would have given this film a 5 star rating instead of 1! Brosnan is nothing but an utter disgrace!"
1,Brosnan is a complete shame!,"What a really disappointing follow-up to the James Bond-films! How in the world do you bring such a nice and nearly perfect Bond-actor like Dalton to the James Bond-role, and then bring this nerdy and lousy actor Brosnan to let him play James Bond? What an insult!Dalton was convincing and really GOOD as James Bond, but bringing Brosnan to the role is the same thing as a complete joke!He is weak and dumb! And what a hell is this? Is this supposed to be a James Bond-movie?What a joke! - It`s a mixture between Die Hard and True Lies!And it lacks ALL of the James Bond-feelings that the films had during the 60-80`s...The Bond-era is OVER! -WHY is people so stupid that they can`t realize that!-It was over after the Bond-movie ""Licence to kill"" was released!I think it`s about time to realize that now!Lousy movie, and has absolutely NOTHING to do with James Bond!"
4,Great Fun,"Frankly my dear, this is the only good Pierce Brosnan Bond movie to date. It's also one of the best Bond films I've ever seen. It's full of all the things that we see Bond movies for: gadgets, stunts, action, Joe Don Baker, and (if you don't mind me saying this) women. And despite his less than stellar track record for Bond films, Pierce Brosnan is easily the best James Bond since Sean Connery.This DVD is absolutely stellar. The 2.35:1 widescreen picture is flawless (as it should be) and beats the heck out of whatever dreary, pan and scan copy is circulating on TV these days. There, as usual for a Bond film, a bucketload of extras. There's an audio commentary (didn't listen), a not so good ""Goldeneye Video Journal,"" a really good TV special ""The World of 007,"" a music video, some trailers and TV spots, and a booklet.This is available in a recent 007 box set, which also includes ""Dr. No,"" ""Spy Who Loved Me,"" ""License to Kill,"" ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" and ""The Man With the Golden Gun."""
3,Goldeneye: a sucessful faliure,"Goldeneye is the 17th movie in the legandary 007 saga stars Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. His perfomance was fantastic. He was a little rigid at times, but in my opinion is 007. However the case with the film is quit different. As an action movie it is spectaluar. As a Bond film, it lacks quite a bit. As an action movie it is one of the '90's best. It plot is not rienforced, and is based around violence, there is no real character devolpment which makes it fun to watch. But it is not very memroable. As a Bond movie it is NOT my favorite! It does follow the ""Bond Formula"" but the plot is based on pure action, there is no chacter devolpment(which I think is bad because after a six year abscence from the silver screen I would like to see how the character has changed. It also can drag. I recommened Tomorrow Never Dies (My FAVE!!!) but watch it and see for yourself. Move over SEAN, Brosnan = Bond!"
2,This is James Bond isn't it?,"I'm sorry but this is not James Bond. Although I am only twelve years old I have seen nearly every Bond movie and read almost every Bond book. I think that something should be done to bring back the James Bond Sean Connery played. I need a Martini drinking, cigar smoking more cool and cocky Bond then Brosnan protrayed. Oh, and since when does James Bond shot a machine gun?"
1,Not worth your MONEY!!,I bake cakes for a living an I had someone want the whipped icing an I thought I would try it out an the instructions dont explain enough. An the icing never got stiff enough to pipe the cake. This is the worst product!!!!
2,Boring.,"Reading about statistics in this manner- the language, crammed text, etc. is a surefire narcotic, if that's what you want. It's heavy on quantitative research and methods- and tries a little too hard to pack it all in. You might use it as a reference but realize that you will probably get a headache from reading more that 5 pages in a sitting."
4,Excellent Starting Point,"This book is a great for the developer or DBA looking to gain a thorough understanding of the basics. Coming from a SQL Server environment, it was difficult learning from other texts that would focus on specific topics (usually DBA related) and fail to answer the questions. This book was the exception. It will not turn you into a guru overnight, but it will provide the foundation needed."
4,Excellent introduction to real options approaches,"This book is written by perhaps THE expert on real options. Dr. Trigeorgis walks the reader from traditional NPV through decision tree analysis, and finally through real options. Perhaps the most valuable discussions in the text concern the strategic and competitive ramifications of a real options mindset which traditional DCF apporaches do not capture. Highly recommended for academics and MBA finance professionals alike. Also serves as an excellent complementary text to other texts on the subject."
5,Probably the most comprehensive book on the subject,"This book is probably the best to get a complete picture of real options concepts. Even if the mathematical concepts included in it are difficult to grasp (particularly once one reach continuous time models), the qualitative explanations give lots of examples that help to understand what the models accomplish, if not how they do it. Interactions of real options with strategy and game theory are also presented, which helps get a feeling of what the practical applications might be."
4,SHOCKING,"This memoire of a woman born to slavery was shocking as well as eye-opening. The author brings to light practices not reported in other accounts of the same genre such as holiday traditions, religious services, and how freed slaves might buy their own family members. There were descriptions of a life so horrible one would rather die or be locked in an attic for years rather than be subjected to a master. The mean-ness of the times seems to be a judgment of society, as only the guilty become paranoid and defensive to the point of abuse.A detractor from the content for me was the style of writing. At times the book became tedious and repititious. The editing also felt stilted as some very elegant Victorian passages were interjected among other simple phrases that seemed to be taken from a primer reader. The ""preachy"" quality also lost its impact. The events themselves were powerful enough to carry the intended message."
3,incidents in the life of a slave girl,"I enjoyed reading this book. But it is hard to believe parts of it are true, such as how long she lived in the attic space."
1,Just could not get into this book,"This was a book club choice for the month, so I gave it a valient effort, but by about page 60 I'd had enough. If you're interested in early American slave history, maybe this one will tick the boxes. But not for me."
2,Incidents In The Life of A Slavegirl.,"Very well wrote. If you like history you will enjoy this book. Easy to read, and will keep your interest.would recommend this book highly. Enjoyed very much."
1,Thank goodness this was free!,"I have read many tales of ex-slaves and at first I was looking forward to a rare account written by a woman. I now regret the time I wasted reading this highly suspect (in my opinion) ""true account"". While I do agree slavery was a horrible time in our history and many facts have been written about the mistreatment of most of the slaves, I think most of this story is ficticious, or at the very least embellished for storyline purposes. 7 years confinement in a floor where she could only lie down, and she stayed there for weeks on end not moving? Not to be crass, but did she never use the outhouse? never bathe? and how did she manage on her monthly? Something is not quite right about this tale. Don't waste your time unless you read it as purely a tale of fiction."
5,Excellent reading,"I usually read just Christian romance books, but this was recommended to me by a friend, and I have hardly been able to put it down. I have not finished it yet because I don't have a lot of free time to read, but when I do, I pick it up and start reading. It has held my interest from the very beginning."
5,Incidents in the life of a slave girl,The biography brings the life of a slave to a point where the reader can truly understand the contrast of a slave life and the life of a free human being. Previous books did not provide me with a clear visualization of the extent of control the slave owner wielded. The story was a poignant reflection of the horrors of being owned.
4,Wow. New Perspective!,"I read this in one evening. I loved it. It gave me a view of slavery that I never realized. Moreover, it's very well written. I found myself wondering if it was actually written by a slave as the language was so modern and easy to relate to. The story itself is incredible, especially the latter half. This woman endured way more than I ever could. Amazing."
5,Sad but True,I believe this story to be a true recall of the life of the Slave Girl. What horrid and frustrating times they were. Some of her experiences were unheard of and fully a personal sacrifice. I would like to thank the author for sharing. May we all gain some compassion from reading this novel.
3,Okay book,It was interesting to read the girls stories I did lose interest in some of them and also got lost in her description a few times but overall it was a goof read.
5,Great Book!,"This book is excellent for those who want to know what life was like as a slave. It was very moving to read about her experiences growing up, and the lengths she had to go to to protect herself and her familiy. Highly recommended."
4,GOOD,"Overall I enjoyed the book. Given the title you must know that it will be somewhat disheartening and sad at times...so I had to pace myself. I appreciate that the author was suttle when she needed to be and blunt when she needed to be..a nice balance overall. I don't like reading about slavery much , but I could handle this one. I would recommend it only if you're mind is ready to take on the injustices of the times."
4,Nice read,"This is an old book but a very interesting read, well written by the slave authour unknown, possibly more educated than we are led to believe. A most enjoyable book of the days of southern American slavery."
5,A story that many should read,Wow is all I can say. It is unbelievable to know that this was written by a girl so long ago. Her spirit is immense and what he went through truly horrible.I found while reading it that I could understand certain aspects of cultures that have formed because of slavery and what an impact it still has on many people today.A must read...
4,Gripping and realistic,"I've read this book a few times over the years. The first being for a college course. It stayed with me then as it did each and every time I've read it. I highly recommend this novel as it is so frighteningly realistic and poignant. I have found myself many times recommending this novel to friends and family. It is rich in culture, history and plot. I highly recommend it."
5,incidents in the life of a slave girl,I really like this story. A great read. Enjoyed the whole thing. Hard to believe this can happen. An eye opener. Worth your time and money.
5,Incidents in the life of a slave girl written by herself... by Harriet Ann jacobs,"I enjoyed this book, so much that I couldn't put it down.I've heard of the way that slaves were treated, but it hit home to read it by someone who lived it."
1,Authentic?,"Perhaps I'm wrong, but the language in this story is of a highly educated person, using words that I, college educated myself, had to look up. It doesn't read like the diary of a slave. Sorry for the pessimism."
4,Excellent Slave History,"This book is hard to put down, and hard to pick up. Dramatic recall of her life as a slave and her escape. I love this book and recommend it to anyone wanting to know the truth about life as a female slave."
5,"We all know about Ann Frank, we all need to know about this story","This book was a wonderful read. I purchase an additional 6 copies for family and friends. It is a must read, we all know or read about Ann Frank in the attic. Every American should know about this young lady in the attic as well.I read the book twice."
4,Very interesting,"A sad look into the hearts of humankind, where men and women can only feel good about themselves at the expense of others sufferings."
5,Very interesting!,"If you like biographies or diaries, about women who really lived and who lived through extraordinary adversity, then you will probably find this interesting. Page after page the author is telling the reader unbelievable things that happened to her, things that no human should have to go through, including hiding in a small attic for years, separated from her children the entire time."
4,Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl Written by Herself,I enjoyed the book. It really makes you think. Hard to believe what she had to do to survive. We could all learn from this story.
3,A little mundane,"While I'm sure it was quite a breakthrough at the time it was written, and a big accomplishment for the author, I didn't find it very stimulating. it even seems to minimize some of the real horrors of slavery, maybe thru a ""polite"" lack of grisly details."
5,Started slow but then I couldn't put it down,Fascinating to read this story from a slaves point of view. You get a very different look at what daily life was like then.
5,Must read,Our history will teach is us never to remonstrate such evil in the state of humanity. The state of womanly sorrows during slavery is documented and should be taken as proof to man's abasement.
5,Very enlightening,A very detailed account of what most females endured during slavery. It answered alot of questions and educated me on the subject matter. Its a great read.
5,Amazing,"This was truly an amazing book. I was thrown into the daily life of this slave girl and her struggles, laughed with her, cried with her and felt her pain. We take for granted our way of life today with all our freedoms, when not so long ago Americans had to live like this girl did. Great, great read!"
5,Powerful Story,"Being an empathetic person, I am still recovering from this book. By far, it is one of the most powerful stories I have read to date. Such a wonderful book. I will never forget the story of this woman and her children. Wow."
5,Superb story,"I rate this book in the top 5 of all the inspirational books I have read. It is a very moving story of the horrors of slavery, by a very courageous and resourceful young woman. It is a real heart tugger, and I could not put this book down until I finished it."
5,Everyone should read this book.,"This book is a heart stopping,tear maker. That poor wowman lived for five years in a small cramped room to ensure her children's freedon. Very emotional and so happy she finally got to freedom and a happy life with her children at books end."
4,Amazing insight,"Reading this book can seem a little strange, and rambling at times due to the literacy level of the writer. The writer tells the story in her own words; some of which you need to interpret her meaning. However, the in depth account of what it was like growing up as a negro slave was heart-rendering and honest. It's really hard to believe that people were treated this way at all, and what's more disturbing is that in some places in this world it probably still exists. The abuse, torture, and most horrific hardships this woman faced had made her a truly amazing woman.Should be mandatory reading for young readers to show the deprivation of this culture. Harriet Ann Jacobs, I take my hat off to you for ""surviving"" such an ordeal you've had to call life."
5,GREAT READING,"I HAD RECENTLY READ THE BOOK ""THE HELP"" WHICH I REALLY ENJOYED. I WAS LOOKING FOR MY NEXT BOOK TO READ AND CAME ACROSS THIS BOOK. I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. I HAVE READ AND HEARD ABOUT SLAVERY BUT TO READ ABOUT THE LIFE OF A SLAVE GIRL REALLY TOUCHED MY HEART. SHE WAS AN AMAZING WOMEN."
4,great book,this was an amazing look at slavery. It explored many avenues that i would have never even imagined. The book was better than the play and the play was excellent.
4,read and live through a slave's ordeal as seen from her own eyes,"This is a gripping story of a bygone era. Jacobs writes in excellent English (with the help of Maria Child, an abolitionist) and makes you feel you are living through her ordeal together with her.I have learned a few bizzare things through this book. The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 allowed slave owners to track down their slaves even in the ""free"" northern states. A slave could ""buy him/herself"" from his/her owner to gain freedom! I always knew money could buy (almost) everything, but it never occurred to me someone might need to buy oneself.It was also interesting for me to see how attitudes of slave owners to their ""property"" could vary so significantly. Some treated slaves as part of the family. Most however cared for them as you would care for a dog: you feed them and call a doctor if needed, even go to the same Church, but never consider them humans."
4,First hand account,"Harriet Jacobs' Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl is unique in that it is one of the few firsthand accounts written by a woman. The book is a tribute to an extraordinary woman who spent much of her life fighting against slavery. She also provides details into the reality of this dark period of American history, constantly struggling with how a nation can be Christian and yet allow the practice to continue. It is impossible to read this book and not be impressed with the quality of this historical figure."
1,Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl Written by Herself,what i read of this book was nothing new. quit reading after the third chapter. sad but boring. don't recommend this as good reading.
2,Was not impressed,Read this because my daughter recommended it and loved it. I thought it was interesting but didn't learn anything I didn't know before hand. Might be a classic but I was not impressed and would not recommend it.
3,A frustrating story about a slave's 9 year escape to freedom,"I had to read this book for school, and I was impressed with some of it. The tone was realistic and believable, and the characters were interesting. But the plot was slow, the book is 200 pages long, and the main character's passive nature makes you want to scream. I don't recommend this book for free reading, but as a slave narrative it meets it's purpose of telling the public about the horrors of slavery. I give it three stars."
2,Not that great for a supposed classic,If you have no knowledge of the life of slaves this would be interesting and informational. If you have lots of knowledge about those times you might find it interesting. I found it boring.
3,Review of Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,At point this novel is rather vivid which just adds to the fact that it is a true story.
2,Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl Written by Herself,"I do not believe that this book was written by a woman. It just didn't read quite ""right""? I can believe that the actions described occured. I just don't think it was written by the person ""herself"" I also think that a lot may have been omitted. I wouldn't recommend that anyone purchase this book. It was free and it should stay that way. Sorry."
2,fact or fiction,"Some say this isnt true, after reading it seems that some is fiction. Especially extensive quotes years after the events from someone who coulnt read or write at the time the events occured and would have no way of recording them for future use. Somewhat drawn out. Keep looking there may be something better out there on the subject."
1,bad buy!!!,"This was a horrible recording. The reader's voice sounded very odd. It's hard to explain, but it sounded kind of computer-ized. Also, certain words or syllables were sped up, while others were drawn-out.It was not even enjoyable to listen to like a story should be. I had to concentrate a lot harder just so I wouldn't miss anything being said. My recommendation would be to save your money, because this product was definitely not worth the price, and the price wasn't even high to begin with. Just for an extra note, I know it was not my player's fault because I tried it on multiple different computers and the recoding always sounded the same."
4,Incidents in the life of a slave girl writtten by herself,"I found this book to be very interesting and factual, for a person who like non fiction books this one is right up your alley."
5,A Must Read!!,I am only halfway through the book and am finding it extremely hard to put it down. It boggles my mind how cruel and inhumane people were in those days. Hearing it firsthand from someone who experienced and persevered through all of it makes it even more intense to read. I give it 5 stars!!!
5,Very readable; very interesting & enjoyable.,"So good it was almost unbelievable! In the middle of the book I had to stop and check the copyright date to convince myself it was not a novel! I thought it might be one of those novels that pretended to be a true story but it turned out to be a true story that pretended to be a novel! The writer is direct and clear but eloquent. Many of her experiences were (not unexpectedly) sad and terrible but not written to elicit anger, hatred or even extreme sympathy. Highly recommended."
2,Very serious book,"I didn't finish this book, didn't appeal to me after I read the first few pages. I didn't care for the book at all."
4,inspiring and embarrassing,"Written in the style to fit the author, this book has both inspired and embarrassed me. That our country could seriously think slavery should be tolerated the way it was!"
4,Interesting read,Knowing it was written by an actual slave made this book an interesting read - I learned a lot about the Southern slaveholders beliefs and the atrocities that befell those unfortunate to have been born into slavery.
4,Review: Incidents in the Life of A Slave Girl,"This is a very touching, profound and thoughtful story about the life of a young girl's journey of slavery from the 1850's through the Nat Turner Revolt into the Civil War, important dates from a historical perspective. The writing is very poignant and sentimental almost prose-like in structure. I was very moved by many of the obstacles she had faced in her life and have to admit there were few moments where tears came to my eyes. This book is an excellent reminder of just how barbaric, unjust, and evil slavery was in our history. Oftentimes, as a society we tend to get desensitized at violent subjects of our past. This book puts slavery back into perspective in a way we have never noticed before. For anyone who doubts the cruelty and inhumanity slavery was or for those that are sympathetic to the Southern cause or justification of slavery...for whatever reason, needs to read this book. Excellent read. Highly recommended!"
4,Great Book!,"For a free book, this was an AWESOME book. I'm not much of a reader. It usually takes me a week or two to read a novel and I read this in two days. I got it simply because it was free and it sounded interesting, and I was surprised at how well it held my interest. Few books do that."
4,Good book,This will make you cringe at the treatment of the poor slaves in America. It's good to get a first hand account.
5,Review of this book,"I recommend this book to anyone that has felt an outcast. What slaves went through, i could not imagine. How could any human being have the right to own another, is inhumane and ungodly. Cruelty still lingers today with prejudices against anyone who isn't white and something that will always sadly remain. I would have been a refuge to a slave with helping in the underground railroad. Slavery should have never existed. To me, Americans were so lazy in taking care of themselves in that time of slavery. May they burn in hell forever for the cruelty they instilled onto human beings."
5,Beautifully written,"An easy and compelling read written so beautifully and earnestly. Both heartbreaking and deeply inspiring.Reminds us that we can always find a way to push forward and create something better in our lives, no matter our present circumstances."
5,Excellent Read,"I wish everyone could read this book. Jacobs writes a story about herself as a Black American slave. Her tale brings the light the terror of people who can take power and abuse, as well, as the compassion of a people who take care of each other. In her writings she not only explains her experiences but also weaves her true tale of other experiences of slavery. She explains the differences between a black male slave and a black female slave experience. Both horrid but very different with the same outcome trauma. Anyone interested in understanding slavery should take the time to read her story. Her story is avaliable for free or a few dollars- and believe me it will be worth your time in doing so.Before I stop writing, her writing is very visual and very well-written. She even explains how she learned to write so well.Read it!"
4,A unique look on slavery,This book gives you a really personal look into the life of a slave. I was in tears several times throughout the book. I recommend.
3,"Interesting, but not spellbinding","This was a free download, so I really can't complain. It was something quick to read during a few minutes of down time. The beginning was much more captive of my attention then from the middle on. I wouldn't add this to my list of must-read classics."
5,Inspirational and Informative story,"The author tells the story of her slave life as she fought valiantly for her freedom.As a former female slave, she gives the female perspective to slavery, which is important as most voices from slavery are in terms of males. So what Jacobs was able to deliver was the rich experience of slavery in the female point of view.However, some might have thought that she romanticized the novel a little bit when she describes her struggle against falling prey to her slavemaster."
4,This story needs to be read,"This is one of those stories that simply must be read by people, to realize what happened in (fairly recent) history, how severe it was, how destructive the consequences were and why it should never happen again. Hopefully people will realize that even in present day many have to live in similar conditions around the world, as slavery is nowadays often hidden or disguised. An amazing life story and under the circumstances amazingly well written by someone who was never allowed to even learn to read."
2,Never surrender,Hence the reason I strongly believe we are very special people. ALL THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS LINDA FACED SHE STILL SEEMED TO HAVE A GOD FEaring heart. She never lost faith in her saviour.
4,Eye opening,"To say I enjoyed this read would be a bit silly as I it was like a bad car accident I couldn't stop staring at. But I couldn't put it down for a minute.I have always been sympathetic towards slavery and being from Australia don't quite understand the full extent of racism in America.What I got from it was that the ""Master's"" were actually slaves to slavery.Very informative and eye opening read."
4,Accomplished and heroric author,I so enjoyed reading this book. I recommend it highly. It is one of those books that you cannot put down. Wonderfully written. Thanks.
4,Dover Edition,"Concerning this edition (the book is a must read)... Dover's thrift editions are just that--thrifty. The text is close together and the overall readability of the edition is fair. It works, but I'd like to see Oxford or Penguin make a ""classic"" edition with a scholary introduction, footnoting and contextual information like 19th century reviews, etc... A good edition, needs improvement, but then it wouldn't have a ""thrifty"" price!"
1,Unbelievable and Not in a Good Way!,"Rarely do I not complete a book. In fact this is only the second time it has happened in my 48 years of living and reading. This book is not believable at all. I am not just referring to the writing because I know that many a slave was taught to write just as well as anyone else. However, the bucking against her master is what is unbelievable. Some of the things she did and said in resistance just does not make sense. Slaves were just that, i.e. slaves, and masters did not have to ask permissions to do anything with them...anything! This book defies logic on so many levels. Thumbs down!"
3,This book was an eye opener.,It really delved into what it was really like to be a slave and it saddened me so much to know that any human had to go through what this young girl did.
5,good read,This book was an amazing read and provided an enlightening view into one of America's most profitable as well as disgusting institutions. I think its important for the world to never forget the injustices suffered by the individuals subjected to the whims of southern white supremacists. When one reads a text like this they do not wonder why race relations are as they are in America today. The stain of slavery is not one so easily washed away no matter how hard revisionist historians try to make light of the plights of those burdened by their skin floor.
2,Depressing,couldnt get into it. The Product is not so y good. I would not buy again. Good value for the price. I would not recommend.
1,Why not?,"'This title is not available for customers from: United States'Why not? Obviously from the location of some of the reviewers, it was and has been!"
1,Boring,"I thought this would be truly interesting, but found that it was very boring and poorly written. I was sorely disappointed."
5,Eye opening,"This book is fantastic. My friend got it for free. I ordered the book later and had to pay a minimal fee for it, but it was an eye opening book. Many of my relatives were slaves and it gave me even more insight to the stories handed down through generations."
4,Good book,"I have read very little about slavery. This book was very enlightening to me. One thing I read about was the children of slaves being sold to other owners was a shock. That never occured to me. I guess I assumed they all stayed together as a family. I have little doubt that most of what she writes about did actually happen. I do think there may be a bit of embellishment to the story. Regardless, if even three quarters of what she wrote about is true it is a travesty that people were treated so badly. No one in this day and age could comprehend what it must have been like to live that way. I enjoyed the book but at the same time my heart went out to all the people she mentioned as being held and abused."
5,Excellent book,"I don't know if this really was written by a slave or not, but it was a very engrossing story. I was on the edge of my seat quite a lot."
4,Incidents in the life of a slave girl written by harriet Ann jacobs,I thought how powerful the story of this woman's life was told and I can only pray she has a peaceful end to her life. I take my hat of to her and wish her the best for what ever life has in store for her.
3,Sadden,"the story was very interesting. However most of the material the writer covered in present times are no longer secrets behind closed doors, however when the story was written they were. Her was very good and my heart went out to all women in today's times that live in slavery. Never have understood nor do I want to understand why man continues to treat fellow man this way."
3,slave girl,really a good book worth reaing and learning from it it is hard to realize that sort of thing went on tant to think life is better now
5,Amazing,"I cannot put into words the power of this author's stories and prose. Her spirit serves as an inspiring example of the things that humans are capable of accomplishing, the endurance, adaptability and strength within us all. So amazing--should be required reading in schools too.I cannot believe that this was free on kindle. Downloaded it at midnight for my flight the next day and stayed up until 5am reading it, then finished it the next day. Just amazing."
4,favorable impression,My wife and I (both senior citizens)found the book both interesting and informative. The main characters were pretty well fleshed out and the action kept moving along pretty well. I would recommend it. It gave a glimpse of a life so different from today.
3,Horror Classics Vol. 4 - ID#12269,"Four movies on one disc.Horror Classics Vol. 4 - Platinum Disc ID#12269#1: Horror Hotel - 1960 - Director: John Llewellyn Moxey**NOTE:** Also released as ""City of the Dead""#2: A Bucket of Blood - 1959 - Director: Roger Corman#3: The Devil's Hand - 1961 - Director: William J. Hole Jr.#4: I Bury the Living - 1958 - Director: Albert BandAll in all; decent picture, decent sound. Nothing special, but menus all seem to work and thats rare for cheap compilation DVD's.These movies are available individually from amazon, so you can see actual reviews and movie details if you search for the title under DVD's."
2,It didn't fit!,"The wrench didn't fit the buffer/sander, even though the part number cross-referenced with the Makita website! I'd like to return it for a full refund."
3,Not the great book that everyone makes it out to be,"I read this book and was disappointed with it.One of the reasons was that it was hyped to be a ""classic"". I forced myself to read to the end for two reasons.The first being that I thought maybe it was just a slow starter,that it would get better by the end.Secondly, because it was for english class so I really had no choice.I was bored by the schizoprehic plot.My only recommendation about this book is to read the Coles Notes when your teacher assigns it to you.It will save you the time that you will waste reading it."
1,A really boring play!,"Even though this play is really short, it took me a long time to read because it was extremely difficult for me to make myself read it. It was difficult to tell the difference from the past and the present at times. Don't read this play unless you actually have to!"
4,51 years ago today.,"This book serves as an excellent commentary on the falsity of the American Dream. Fed the propaganda of prosperity, every person believes they can make it in life, while most live out a modest existence. I give 4 stars because as a book it is not spectacular, but as a play, this work is brilliant. It's not a tongue-in-cheek satirical examination of insanity and lost hope. Instead, Miller grants us a bare-bones look at the psychological process of a man who's world falls apart because he puts too much importance on being 'well-liked'. Miller deftly examines the importance of charisma while providing for some values that we should all embrace; study, work, and love. What does this all come down to? Love accepts character flaws, but 'well-liked' doesn't."
2,a story about the common worker with only a dream,The entire story was very plain except for the ending which twisted in the most dramatic of ways. I would imagine the performance would affect peoples lives much more than the book
4,family tragedy,"I liked to read this book. It's a story about a family who seems to be like a normal falmily but actually isn't. Thus it's the father, who is a salesman, who wants the family to have a good reputation. His goal is it to be well-like and to have lots of people coming to his funeral. He's hard working his whole life but still doesn't get this good reputation. he wants his two sons to be well-liked and well-know also. also the mother, who seems not to have a back role in the play, is pretty important because she is the one who tries to be real and see things how they are. but she tries to cheer people up, thus she wants her family to be happy. she wants everybody to get along in the family while her husband doesn't really care what's happening in the family itself but he wants other people to have good thoughts about his family."
3,Living the American Dream,"Willy Loman, the main person always thinks and talks about success. He wants to be very successful and tries to make himself and his family happy, but does not succeed. People like Willy are very common in today's society. They live the American Dream; everybody wants to be successful. Willy is not satisfied with himself, because he didn't succeed in business life, well, that is how business is. That is what happened to Willy. He let it out on his wife, and his two sons, Biff and Happy. And they suffer under his pressure. He treated his wife like an object, cheated on her, and was constantly telling her to shut up. He completely ignored Happy, and he tried to make Biff into something he wasn't (which subsequently made him incredibly unhappy).At the end of the book Willy kills himself. This shows that Willy's only values in life. The book was a bit difficult to read, because the play shifts between present and past, which makes it a bit confusing."
2,Study of the the American Family,"This is a dramatic play which criticizes the American society after World War II. It shows the problems of a family, especially the relation between father this hard period. It's about a salesman (Willy Loman), who hasn't any success any longer as he gets fired. He puts all his hopes in his two sons but they fail. The older (Biff) very strange past, because he hasn't had a job for longer then some months and he was in prison for some time. The younger brother of Biff (Happy) has a job, but he doesn't care about his father has and is more interested in women. The only hold for Willy is his wife Linda who always believes in him. The play has a very tragic end what depends on these difficult relations more and more the relation to the reality and dreams of ""the good old da3 everything was nice. This hopeless situation finishes with the suicide of Willy. The play was quite difficult because of all the flashbacks into the past."
2,ok,"I was forced to read this book in school. Honestly, I hated the book. Didn't the man just travel from town to town and he had a wife and mistress. How am I supposed to feel for him? I just can't. I hope if I read it again it will shine in a different light."
2,Script was Missing Pages,"I ordered the script in January. I finally got around to reading it (or trying to) today, and it is missing the first 16 pages. Unacceptable.UPDATE: Amazon got me a new script, this time with all of the pages."
4,CD Audio - Death of a Salesman,Seller sent me the audio CD very quickly - I was concerned since there was no expedited shipping - my son had to listen/read this for his AP English and we were driving home from vacation
5,A classic story...,"Death of a Salesman is a classic for a reason. Not only does it portray the life of a mere middle-class family rather than royalty, it examines the need for life-fulfillment. Loved it!"
5,The fall of an old man who failed to fulfill his dreams.,"Arthur Miller has eloquently created a protagonist who has been churned by the ill system. Willy Loman who realizes that his whole dream has turned into a nightmare chooses to commit-suicide. Yet, has he achieved to change the mere truth? Biff and Happy , will they ever recover from the bitter reality. Their father is just a simple example , however , on second thought we all know that salesman confront difficulties in their old days. What we earn for a living in our young days may be sufficient but its the future we must think of , seriously. The burden of our disabled times should be insured by the state and we must dream of illusions that our not far beyond our reach. Otherwise, the fall is inevitable , just like it is in the Loman's. Sad and tragic."
4,contrasting the performance and the book,"I saw the current broadway performance before reading it, and am very glad I did because if I hadn't I would have been extremely confused as to what was going on. I highly recommend seeing it on broadway and also reading it, because Brian Dennehy does a fantastic job of Willy and just gives him so much character. I'm sure Dustin Hoffman (I hope thats who did it but I'm not sure) was great too, but Dennehy has an enormous amount of stage presence. My only complaint about the book is that it is a little hard to follow. But other than that it is wonderful."
4,Intresting.,"I had to read this for my english class this year, and it definitely wasn't what I expected. I had read it once before, and I just couldn't understand it. Willy skipped from dreams to reality so much, I couldn't keep 'em straight. When I read it out loud with my english class, I got to really know the whole cast, and now I truely understand it. I like the play alot now. I hope to see it on Broadway also. I recommend this book, and if you don't understand it, read it again."
5,This is THE book.,"This is the book that clearly explains how oil painting was taught in the 1880's. If you like the way the masters of the day painted and you want to know how to do it, this is THE book. Written by a real, professional oil painter whose paintings are still on public display (because they are great). the book is short, to the point, and will not mislead you. The near deification of guys like Parkhurst mystifies me in the face of Colliers concise and practical teaching. If it sounds like the ""matching colors on the palette knife"" technique is easy, then just try it. It is harder than it sounds but your reward will be your ability to see colors you never before really perceived. Priceless."
4,An interesting story,Ascension is by far my favorite book of the trilogy. It is about a young mermaid who dreams of being an Avatar of Atlantis. In a surprising twist of events she finds her world of Atlantis falling apart with only herself left to save it.
5,Thrilling and satisfying fantasy adventure,"Nia of Atlantis is the perfect age at the perfect time in the perfect place. The time has come to choose the next Avatar, one of a group of ten rulers who control Atlantis. At sixteen, Nia is already a highly skilled athlete, and is naturally a prime candidate to be chosen to compete for the position in the name of her clan. But strange things begin to happen around Nia, and she gradually begins to discover that Atlantis is not quite the perfect place it always pretended to be, nor is her family free of startling secrets... This book is a fast moving and highly engaging fantasy adventure that I greatly enjoyed. A word to the wise; don't buy this book without it's two sequals!! Good for all ages."
2,A Surprising Let-Down,"Judging by the other reviews of this book, I thought that this book would be right up my alley. However, when I bought the book and read it it, I was shocked to discover how simple and boring it was. Although I am not in the usual age group for this book, I usually enjoy books of this nature (I still love all of Tamora Pierce's books, Harry Potter, CS Lewis, lot's of childrens' books) but this book was just terrible. Flat characters, predictable story. Worst of all, the book ends on a cliffhanger, almost forcing you to buy the second book of the trilogy. Now, we're not talking about a mystery left unknown until the next book, we're talking a real, last episode of the season cliffhanger. That's not fair to readers. If you want a good book, check out Tamora Pierce, especially her Song of the Lioness books. They won't dissappoint you."
3,"It.. uh.. could have been better, but...","Well, I loved most of this book. I read it when I was about 12 I think, and it was the first real fantasy I had ever read. I read it really quickly, and I had every intension of reading the other books in the trilogy. Until the end anyway. ^_^; It was really shocking towards the very last pages, and there was some killing and blood. I know some people say it's perfectly decent for 8 year olds, but it still seems pretty iffy. It just depends on perspective, I guess."
3,Asension,"I don't think this book was that bad. Although some part were boring. And you could easily tell Nia would not be nominated to be an Avatar. I really don't know why she had a crush on Cephan other than the fact that he was 'so handsome.' But the adventure parts were okay, especially the Trials. What I really didn't like was the ending. It finished way to abruptly. After that, I had to buy the second book, just to find out what happened. I guess this book is okay."
4,A good book,"Althought this book was a little boring and the plot somewhat predictible, it was a good book and I liked it. It has wonderful descriptions of characters and the city of Atlantis. Anyone who likes mermaids would like this."
4,Great Atlantis Mermaid fantasy,"Nia the mermyd is a young girl in the underwater world of Atlantis. She is one of many young mermyds wanting to become her family's choice to try out for Avatar, one of the ruling members of Atlantis society. But when she is not chosen and strange things begin to happen all around her, she knows something is not right in her world and decides to do something about it. She is a good role model for young teens as she has a strong personality and a desire to do what is right for herself and the world of Atlantis.My 13 yr old daughter really enjoyed this book and so I decided to read it also. I enjoyed it just as much and we are both moving on to books 2 and 3 in this series."
1,Avoid!!,"Avoid this at all costs.Purchased this item during the holidays.The box was filthy and torn on several places.Upon opening the item, I discovered several dings on the wooden base as well as huge paint peels on the front of the base.The bottom base had a 5 inch crack that was exposing the wood.Thanks to Amazon's return policy I was able to ship it back and the charge credited back to the account."
2,"one simple idea, stretched out","Don't let subordinates dump their problems/responsibilities on you. That's the ENTIRE book. Stretched out just long enough, to rook people out of money. VERY little, for the money."
3,"Good concepts, maybe not book-worthy","My boss is a big One Minute Manager advocate, so we all ended up reading this book. It covers some great concepts in interesting ways, but it felt more like an essay stretched to fit into a book. I was tired of reading it halfway through, which is pretty sad considering how short it is."
3,Good but not the best...,"Based on the reviews here I think I was expecting more than I got. A previous reviewer mentioned that this was one of the funniest books he had ever read... I didn't find it funny or enlightening. I think it was a good book and worth what I paid for it, that's it."
5,"""It's tough to work for a nervous boss; especially if you are the one who's making your boss nervous.""","Solving problems (or as Blanchard refers to them... monkeys) is something everyone must get better at throughout life. Regardless if you are in the field of business, medical, or even in parenting, solving problems is a big part of being successful every day. That's why I think this book is for everyone. I personally took away valuable knowledge on how to delegate properly and keep a team of people moving in the same direction. One of the great arts of management is delegation and the principles in this book are simply fantastic ideas that when applied, do work. This book cost me $12 and it's helped to make companies I've worked for millions. Pretty good value!"

1,Fell apart within 2 days of use,The pins started falling out of the chipboard with only two days of use. The tip is plastic as opposed to metal. Very cheaply made.
1,Cheap P.O.S.,"This has got to be the cheapest, worst made thing I have ever gotten stuck with after ordering online. It isn't straight or well put together and it is less than a foot long. Don't waste your money!! Mine fell apart and is useless on the second day."
1,Fell apart within 2 days of use,"Fell apart after only two days. Tip is plastic instead of metal. Very poor quality, wouldn't buy it again, even if it only cost a nickel."
1,JUNK!,Don't waste your money. After only usiing for a few days the thumbtacks that are used to keep it together started coming out. Air escaped from everywhere except out the end. I hade to use duct tape to keep it together. Don't buy. Buy a higher quality one. Plastic tip melted. JUNK!
1,an AIR GRILL works much better,I had one of these and then a friend gave me an air grill...doesn't even compare when it comes to trying to keep your fire going.
4,A milestone of new economic thought,"This book is definitely a milestone of modern economic thought. It is one of the brightest signs of changing paradigm, from considering only those problems as 'economical' where prices and volumes could be estimated, to go beyond towards traditional areas of other sciences. Economics of family and of crime to name a few. Becker considers the decision making in these cases to show that it can be straight economical, the same as applied in a pricing or in a decision to produce. The judgement of Becker's 'economic imperialism', though, is a discussible point of view. To what extent economic reasoning can be applied is a matter of axioms underlying every economic theory. And these are not obvious but questionable instead. Therefore, it is my belief that this book should be read with a greater degree of criticism, just like any analysis of problems beyond 'traditional' scope of issues of economics."
3,The Individual must always take a Back Seat,Very interesting discriptions of old ideas and a fine example of the ability of good economists to read between the lines and numbers of those projected to authoritive status. Awards and medals go a long way in cognitive dissonance. Why is economics following psychology's fear of the very fragil human element of free will?
5,Live with a master!,"We have been collecting art and working in the arts for a combined total of over 40 years. Working with Moors Modern Master has been the best experience we've ever had - all nine works we've purchased have arrived in perfect condition beautifully matted and framed with high end materials. Plus they were shipped promptly and securely packaged and sold at a very fair price. We have never been disappointed. Our focus is on works of historical significance. As we've learned, their condtion and authenticity is more important than whether or not the works are signed, especially since it is so difficult to determine if the signatures are auththentic anyway, so we encourage potential buyers not to be discouraged by the fact that a work is not signed by the artist. We are planning to buy from this vendor again as soon as possible."
3,Nice for really little beginners,"I bought this product for my 15 months old daughter. She loves crayons, pencils, stamps etc. I wanted to introduce her to watercolors and do some potato-stamping. I found it a bit odd that you couldn't just get watercolors everywhere. I grew up with pelikan watercolors but they are a bit pricey here. I wasn't expecting much in comparison because of the other reviews. Well, the colors are fine and my little one can mess with them and it has 24 colors. But the quality isn't that good. The colors aren't really bright. So for now it's really fine because she can get creative and learn with them (and they are washable, which is an absolut plus for really little artists). But if she gets older and still likes to paint with watercolors she will get a set from Pelikan."
5,Awesome colors,"We received a set of Rose Art watercolors for a birthday gift, and when they started getting low I ordered these. The difference in quality was amazing. I've got a picture of the two side by side, and the superior coverage and brightness of the Crayola paints is obvious."
4,Crayola washables,The item was everything I exspected it to be. The colors are such a variety that keep children coming back to paint.
5,great color choices,"My kids love these water paints. The 24 different colors are really nice shades. With the right amount of water the colors look amazing on paper, you couldn't even tell it was water paint. I got these for my 3 & 5 year old and they love when its time to paint and prefer these water colors to regular paint."
4,Sean Mooney,"I love this book. It is a little difficult as some of the English Grammar is now outdated. It also uses some antiquated wording and awkward phrasing. However, after reading a few books from the era it is easy enough to get used to. I had to expound on one of the Beatitudes as an exercise in my Bible STudy. I did get some good background material on this beatitude from this book. I also used some other expositions. I am a relatively new Christian so I need as many expounded passages as I can get. I would encourage you to read this book because the English and phrasing is unique and there is artistry in it. It makes a difficult subject to concentrate on easier because there is a certain amount of Joy in figuring this out.Sean"
5,Awsome,"The bible was bran new and came very quick. Also to get a Thompson chain bible for $19.40 is un heard of....i was satisfied.Just make sure you dont make the same mistake i did, i ordered spanish when i wanted english...my fault."
4,Moleskine sketch notebook,Product was given as a gift and recipient loved it! Thank you for timely delivery and confirmation.
5,The best sketchbooks,"I use these notebooks to write my journal. I know that this is a SKETCHBOOK, it has blank thick pages which makes it awesome to write with any ink without bleeding into the next page.It in not very small, not very big, it fits your coat inner pocket with no problem."
4,Compañia,"Musica que me acompaña durante mis noches de trabajo. Las canciones son muy conocidas y si bien es musica instrumental, no le resta esa emocion que alguna de ellas puede transmitir. Este cd no podia faltar a mi coleccion."
4,horror to see nightmare and hope going hand in hand,"Dr. Patrick Corey, the main character, deals with two experiments on the human brain. Both are narrated well, are fascinating and they give some real thrill about the opportunities science has got. It is on the one hand like opening Pandora's box, showing a nightmare becoming true, and on the other the prospects that could be reached. Never science is alone, like in a lab. There are always other interests interfering - politics, especially in the time of the Cold War, and money, but also human features like pride or man's will to get as close as possible to the secrets of nature. Siodmak tells the stories and the reader thinks the story on with all the possible consequences. Real horror to see peril and evil and hope and help clearly in the same topic!!!"
1,A good perf spoiled by the remastering,A small thriller with the good actress Linda Blair ruined by the absence of technical treatment ( the film is almost 20 years old)the sound is fine. But the image shakes a lot at the beginning it is awfully blurred and waned as if the technician brought a digital camera in a movie theater to record the film... on the screen !Avoid this version (New Star Video) that is supposed to be digitally remastered.too bad for the original I appreciated in 1984
1,Don't support this release!!!,"By buying this bootleg from a VHS tape you're ensuring that this film will never come out legitimately remastered from film elements and with extras! Seriously folks, don't buy anything put out by this company, Jef Films, they've been stealing films left and right, including several well-known titles, and are simply killing any potential sales of the titles to legitimate companies who will treat the films right. I am appalled that this currently (at the time of this writing) is ranked at #7,846 on the Amazon DVD charts, which means in terms of this niche market it's a success. Shame on all of you who bought this disc when you could have just burned your VHS tape to a DVD-R for $2 and still helped ensure that the film will be treated properly in the future!! Any DVD release put out by Jef Films, Televista, New Star, etc. is a BOOTLEG!!!!"
4,Actually very good,"This was a surprisingly good movie, with descent acting,a great plot, and an equally satisfying lead actress. Linda Blair stars as Brenda in this motion picture and adds a lot to the movie as well as the role. In the end, all i can say is that you should give this movie a chance, like i did."
5,one of Linda Blair's Best!,"This is one of my, if not my favorite Linda Blair film. It's about Linda Blair and her friends who are in a fun loving but tough gang. after she and her friends play a joke on the local bad boy gang ""scars, they get even with her. ... blair goes after them for revenge... her way. this is one i have seen countless times and i could watch it again. the only scene that i thought went too far was the rape scene. that was horrible.Linda Blair is one of my favorite actresses and i remember seeing the ads for this in the paper when i was about 10! I should've snuck into the theater! This is one of those movies many consider trashy but i think its great. classic one liners are everywhere. see this movie!"
5,You Never Know,"I grew up in a small southern town, but have lived in California for many years. For me, this book evoked the best and the worst of my heritage and did it with wit, style, respect and grace. The characters are fully drawn and more realistic than many might imagine. While the story could easily have lapsed into slapstick, the author manages to avoid crossing the line. If you are looking for a book that will engage you with both the plot and the people who carry the story, and will make you laugh, try this one. If you are a transplanted southernern who appreciates some aspects of the south and is glad to be rid of some others, try this one."
4,Funny but poignant,"Evidently I've been reading too many depressing and serious novels....Miss Julia was just what I needed! I didn't think I would enjoy it so much but I LOVED it. It wasn't the actual plot that got me but the characterization. As a woman living in the South, I found Miss Julia TOTALLY believeable! I laughed out loud and smiled throughout the book....however....I sensed an ""ache"" also....it was very touching....the ""late blooming"" so-to-speak of Miss Julia.Yes, she becomes very strong after her husband dies, but there is still a fragility lingering there. Under that crusty and sometimes prideful persona is a warm and generous heart. Also....I had the good fortune to hear Ann Ross speak and she is WONDERFUL.I know...she SWEARS she is NOT Miss Julia...but if you ever get the chance to meet her...go for it!"
5,Miss Julia -- A Spunky Lady,"It sure didn't Ann Ross long to let you see that Miss Julia's true personality had been suppressed for all the years of her marriage. She is a delightfully strong woman who was very capable of taking care of sticky situations, even though many of them tend to get her flustered at first. The characters who surround Miss Julia are beautifully blended and woven into the story. It is fun to see her change from a Southern fine lady, always taken care of, never having to deal with uncomfortable matters to this woman who will take on the devil, himself, if necessary. Miss Julia may not have changed Abbottsville, but she sure gave it a kick in the pants. I found her delightful. Thumbs up for Miss Julia!"
3,Would make great beach reading,"I wouldn't say this story is a page-turner, but it was a worthwhile read. Miss Julia's character was developed quite well, although I do believe Ross could have spent more time making the other characters more interesting."
5,Miss Julia,"I love the Miss Julia series. Ever since I read the first one, I have waited anxiously for the April release every year of the next book."
3,Entertaining,"Poor Miss Julia. Having just buried her controlling husband who died of a heart attack and learning just how much he was worth, she starts planning how to start spending some of her inheritance when the doorbell rings and she finds herself facing ....her husband's mistress and 9 year old son.If that wasn't bad enough, the mistress leaves her son with Julia and flees. Everything just spirals out of control at that point. Julia has to fight a greedy pastor, a conniving doctor, a break in, kidnappings and harboring potential fugitives, but she's just fiesty enough to keep her head .... almost.Bursting with humor, this was a fun read."
4,Southern Fiction Lover,"When told about the Miss Julia series, I was eager to read these clever stories with the wonderful flavor of the South. This book was so enjoyable, I immediately purchased the second book ""Miss Julia Takes Over"". That one was so ridiculously unbelievable, I could barely finish the book.... and won't bother with the rest of the series. I was very disappointed."
1,Cheap Imitation,"This book seems unclear whether it is being written in the past or the present. Miss Julia and her acquaintances still wear hats to church in the middle of summer, and have hired help to come in on a daily basis to cook and clean. It's hard to feel sorry for or sympathize with Miss Julia. She is bent on only looking out for herself. She shows no compassion for the poor child that has been thrust on her; she only wishes to put the best face on things to preserve her standing in town.Miss Julia seems to have no friends in this book other than her hired help. It's no wonder, as she has no qualities which would make her suitable for friendship. She thinks and speaks in trite phrases. The plot is contrived and hard to swallow. For those who have read books in the Mitford series, you will find this a shallow imitation, lacking all the charm of Karon's characters."
1,ISMS,"I choose this book because readers who read Joam Medlicott had read Ross. Big mistake on my part. Sexism and ageism as the bases of a story is not my cup of tea. Nor does Ross's writing, character development or southern flavor come through in a rich, delightful way. The dignity, insight and autonomy I loved in the Covington books are completely absent in this piece of fictional waste. Skip it I say."
5,Miss Julia takes the cake!,"There isn't much I can add to all the other reviews of this great book!I read it because it was on our local library's ""Pick of the Month"" list. I couldn't put it down. I read it all the way through. (Luckily it was a Saturday!)It's great! It's funny! And we should all have as much starch and vinegar as Miss Julia has!I'll be shoving it down the throats of all my friends demanding that they read it - and then I will sit back and smile when they thank me!"
5,I couldn't sleep a wink last night...,"'cuz I was sooooo busy reading this wonderful book. I felt like I was right there alongside Miss Julia during her self discovery moments and escapades through Abbotsville, NC. I could feel myself ""cheering her on"" to sass those men in her town who felt superior to their women. A recent widow, she grew more confident in her desire to be in charge of herself and not be ""run"" by any man! The book was delightful in its presentations of small southern town. Having just returned from North Carolina, I recognized the highways that Miss Julia was driving during her great ""getaway"" scene. This is a MUST READ if you have also enjoyed stories such as FRIED GREEN TOMATOES. Enjoy!!!"
5,I Just Loved This Book,"Miss Julia should be everyone's favourite aunt or grandmother. She is an absolute hoot who gets her revenge on her skin-flint husband after years of his domination. I'm not saying that this is the greatest piece of literature ever written, but I so enjoyed this story and all the characters in it, that I just wish that there were more Ann B. Ross books available for me to turn to next. Here's to you, Miss Julia!"
4,Miss Julia is an interesting lady,"I found this book through a recommendation after reading almost all of Joan Medlicotts books. The central character is a mature lady who doesn't fit the ""sweet little ole lady"" mold frequently expected of ladies over sixty-five. She is faced with many challenges after the death of her husband. She is forced to be resourceful and clever to deal with the many personalities involved. I enjoyed her adventures with family, friends, and enemies. I'm looking forward to reading about her next adventures."
2,Miss Julia Speaks Her Mind,"This book should not be in the ""read alike"" category with Jan Karon's Mitford books. I've read and reread the Mitford books, laughing, crying, while being uplifted by the message and loving all the characters and their uniqueness.Miss Julia Speaks Her Mind: A NovelI won't be buying any more Miss Julia books."
4,good mindless read,This series in NOT like the Mitford series. Close-minded Christian readers should NOT read this book. For me it was interesting and fun to see the main character change as she faces losing her husband and having her husband's transgressions thrust upon her. She learns to be more tolerant and forgiving. The characters have lots of flaws which made them endearing to me. I will look for more in the series.
4,Take a delightful romp through Abbotsville!,"Delightful is the only word I can think of to sum up this novel! With newfound freedom, finances and family, the recently widowed Miss Julia takes on adventures of all kinds. The characters are lively and interesting, to say the least, and the reader is taken along for the ride as one unbelieveable event after another unfolds. It's great fun to watch Miss Julia go from 1950s housewife to proud single woman. During the first few chapters, I was starting to wonder if I had somehow mistakenly picked up some kind of lovelace pulp, but I'm glad to have stuck it out until the last scene unfolded! This book would be an excellent choice for airport or car reading."
5,A must read!,"Ann B. Ross has captured the essence of the South in this delightfully humorous and poignant novel. For us who grew up in the South, you will ""know"" the characters as people who lived in your home town. With conversational style, Ross includes old Southern expressions that I have long been teased about using: ""not worth a hill of beans,"" ""It's coming up a cloud."" Miss Julia Speaks Her Mind is an easy, entertaining read. Enjoy!"
4,A southern delight,"Poor Miss Julia, not only has her husband died, but soon after a child is left on her doorstep. After living a life seemingly beyond reproof, Miss Julia discovers that her deceased spouse has sired a son. A puny, not much spunk son at that. Miss Julia is determined that she will do the right thing by the child, even though she has no children of her own, and finds them a bit bewildering. It's time she started thinking for herself. Aided by her lawyer and housekeeper, Miss Julia undertakes to untangle the mess her husband has left behind. What she doesn't see coming is the mad dash for her husband's money, and the lengths even the most respectable people will go to to try to get their hooks into that big chunk of change. Nor does she see how Little Lloyd or his mother will fit into her settled, respectable life. A wonderful characterization of life in a small southern town."
5,Author Ann B. Ross must have followed me around since 1950.,"I cannot BELIEVE that Ann B. Ross could write MY story without knowing me! She has not left out ONE event in my marriage! Sometimes life for me was not funny at all, but I laughed all the way through ""Miss Julia."" Every woman who would like to emerge from her ""protected state"" should read this book! A great big ""thank you"" should go to Ann B. Ross. I read the Readers Digest Condensed version; now I'm ordering the book!"
4,ENTERTAINING READ,"A most enchanting, light, humorous, and enjoyable read, this book can be consumed in one sitting. The plot is simple, but fun; the characters eccentric, but believable; the writing mild and light. If you want pure entertainment without profound truths, or astounding revelations, chose ""Miss Julia Speaks Her Mind."" Treat yourself; you deserve it!!!!"
2,Mildly Entertaining,"Miss Julia would have been a more acceptable character for me if the book had taken place in the 1930s or so. But to be in her 60s in present-day America, she was pretty annoying. She seemed much older than my grandmother, who is in her 90s and living in the Deep South. I'm sure my grandmother would find Miss Julia pretty gullible and judgmental and waaaay behind the times. And very slow on the uptake. Things that were clear to me at the very beginning didn't quite come to her for many, many pages later.Not a bad read, but I was very impatient to finish the book and forget about this backwards, overly-prim woman."
2,Disappointing,"This book was definitely NOT enjoyable to me but rather frustrating. Miss Julia is a naive and annoying character. The plot lines and scenarios throughout the novel are cheesy and asinine. The ending especially. I had expected something more true to the human character. The characters are overdone in an attempt at humor but produce instead a ridiculous and predictably boring novel. If you are looking for the genius of Flagg or the flowing words of West...keep looking. However, I would recommend this book to someone who is looking for a simple read to pass the time."
1,Not worth time,"Picking this book up from a thrift store, I left it sitting on my shelf nearly two years. Now, I know why. This book lacks a lot especially a well-developed character. I found it falling short in the ""traditional Southern humor"" found in books like the Mitford series and am still looking for the ""interesting take on gender, race and family in the South"" as declared by another critic. I read the entire book before officially declaring a distaste for it. This book fails in the wit and charm department and I will not be reading any more of this series."
2,Poor character development,"I found this book poorly written as far as character development. Miss Julia seemed to be a fabricated character, rather unbelievable as a real person. Her dialogue and inner thoughts were sterotypical and predicatable. She seemed flat to me. Honestly, I found the book rather blah as a piece of literature. However, the story line does allow for some twists and turns and surprises, and I was interested enough to finish the book."
4,Easy and fast reading,This book makes you forget about the headlines and all the heavy things in life and keeps things simple and funny.
5,allergy awareness,We used this to help with my son's food allergy awareness. It was a wonderful training assistant for his daycare.
3,Too Dark,"Something came wrong with the film. The movie is great and full of action and romance and lively entertainment, but the film needs to be lightened and restored to be perfect."
3,Borderline,"I personally like classic movies; this one I never seen before and I enjoyed it. I recommend it to anyone, you can set back with the family because it doesn't have all the violent crimes (bloody)we normally see now a days."
2,Credit this informative review to Michael from Muskogee OK,"This is a bland little crime drama that screams for a decent story line and script. Two undercover agents(Fred MacMurray and Claire Trevor)try to bust up a drug-smuggling ring in Mexico. The two not knowing the real identity of the other end up falling in love. MacMurray proves he can play any kind of role. Trevor seems out of place and wrong for the part. Raymond Burr plays a heavy in more ways than one. Also in the cast are: Jose Torvay, Roy Roberts and Don Diamond.I would add to this that if you want great film noir with Clair Trevor then check out ""Key Largo""; as for Fred Mac Murray, ""Double Indemnity."""
3,Genre Challenged But Good,"""Borderline"" doesn't know what it wants to be....it's a collision of genres, comedy and police drama with the lighter side dominating. Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I didn't once look at my watch. The humorous lines are genuinely funny especially from Claire Trevor. There are little nuances that add so much to a scene. Without delivering a spoiler, there's a scene where MacMurray and Trevor are at the house of the local sheriff. The bit with the sheriff's daughter lends a nice touch of humor to an otherwise functional scene. There are a lot of these nuances either in action or dialogue throughout the movie. I would say that if you are looking for a good crime drama from this era, you might be disappointed. If however you go into the movie knowing it's not typical of the genre, you should be able to meet it on its own terms and have fun. I do recommend this film."
5,AIR FILTER,"PREFECT....I AM SUTISFITE..I SET IT EASY, ENGEEN IS WORKING BETTER ... MY CAR IS FEEL GOOD , BMW 330 CI"
1,"oh my, this is really bad","overacting, non-acting, poor script, just some of the problems with this ""movie"". i'll probably end up trashing the disc and reusing the case. it's really bad."
1,Do not read this book!,I put one star because it was no choices for zero stars. Please do not read this book unless your have trouble falling asleep. This book is terribly boring and contains some disgusting details about carving human's body. Not recommended.
2,"""Catastrophic""","If I understand you right, a scar is a ""catastrophe"" whereas cancer itself or surgical treatment of cancer is somehow less ""catastrophic""? Does this make sense to you?Anyone who reads my book will discover that there are skillful and reckless ways to use cancer salves, but dismissing something because of scarring seems a bit overzealous. Haven't you seen surgery scars.I haven't read this article, but the headlines are just too sensational."
3,Autobiographical,"I didn't see the six stars others have. Because the subtitle was ""Finding intimacy and fullfillment by following His lead"" I thought it would be more general for women looking for purpose and relationship. Instead I found the book to be highly autobiographical. While I enjoyed visiting how God carved the sculpture of her life, I found myself skimming over some of the detail and rabbit trails.At books' end, though, I remain inspired to know that if God can work through this woman to the levels he has he can work through me similarly."
5,From a man's perspective,"Great book talking about how life's trials can be overcome if you have the right attitude and approach them from the standpoint of asking the question ""what would God expect me to do now""?"
5,Magical,I purchased this for my Kindle and it is so smart and informative. I want to have a relationship that is based on God's intention for my life and this shows that.
5,Great book,This book was suggested to my friend by her therapist and she was unable to purchase it. I found it on Amazon for her and ended up reading it myself .
5,Stories are how we come to know God.,"When you think about the ways we understand God, all of them come through stories. Stories about how He worked through others' lives. The Bible is chock full of stories about all kinds of people. Our job is to find common experience and reflect on the ways God moves through us. So it is with this book. I've never given the Cinderella story as much thought, but Connie shows how all love stories are fairy tales -- even a love story with God. Just read it. I know you'll find something awesome that touches your life in a very intimate way. I will re-read and share this beautiful story."
4,CMT router bi5t,"I haven't had a chance to use this bit yet, but it appears to be of the same fit and finish as other CMT bits I've purchased over the years. I've gotten fairly nice performance out of the CMT line. I'm giving it an overall four (""I like it"") based on my previous experience with this maker. I would have preferred to pick up a Whiteside bit, based on how well they've done in side-by-side comparisons with other bits in a product review done by Fine Woodworking, but Whiteside does not appear to make this particular chamfer bit. The price of the CMT bit was considerably below what Woodcraft and other mail order sources are selling them for. Delivery was quick. I was a little concerned that the label/seal on the plastic bit case had been opened and the usual CMT literature was missing from the case. No big deal on the missing literature, and the blade seemed to be intact."
1,Bad seller,We bought a text book from this seller and was given a bad tracking number and was told that the package was waiting at the postoffice when we received no such notice. Very upset with the seller.
1,Don't buy this book,"They removed my last review, maybe this one will make it. Don't buy this book. Its written by a pack of convoluted thinking leftist bedwetters. if you want a factual book about the U.S. Constitution buy one published by the Cato Institute."
5,excellent,Its been a long time since I was able to give 5 stars to a concert DVD but this one is excellent. A nice long high quality performance. both sound and visualy well captured. Great camera work shows what you want to see. no corny graphics floating around or bizzar camera angles.The extras are pretty decent too. Nice long interview with mick and Clive. Plus all the art work for you to rip.This is a must for US fans so buy it!
4,Almost Perfect !,"The image & sound are perfect. If you like bands like Marillion, IQ, Dream Theater, Flower Kings, Spock Beards & Transatlantic, this DVD is for you. For the people that already know Arena, there are two songs that will miss, ""Crack in the Ice"" and ""Moviedrome"". The performance of the band is very good.Keep it under Progressive Rock label."
3,Decent sampling of live Van,This recording is fairly unassuming. It is enjoyable but it does not elevate to a higher level. I prefer the Live in San Francisco more.
2,Unlikely on many levels,"Yes, I know Tanith Lee is super-famous and has won all sorts of fancy literature awards, but I'm still not afraid to say that this story has serious flaws.I suppose the intent is entirely for romance, but the irresponsible behavior of the humans is extremely difficult to accept.As foolish as it was in the first place to ever create such superpowered, indestructible robots in the first place, with all these incredibly dangerous abilities - no one even tried to reign them in. They knew the robots were killers, and they just covered it up and let them skate away scott-free. Any sane human being would sooner spritz the city with aerosolized Ebola than let these killing machines ever escape the lab.I just can't accept that any professional organization would be so irresponsible as to allow the major events in this story to progress. Oh, and the proofreading was NOT perfect, despite the book's lofty origin and authorship."
2,Don't buy it,"As you can see from all the other reviews, this book was no comparison for The Silver Metal Lover. The first book wasn't written spectacularly well, but it did make you believe such a world existed. It would be great for a lazy weekend and overall I rate that book 4/5 stars. It was an easy, lovely read. However, half of this book made constant references to the first book; it was in no way it's own book. Just a ghost riding on coat tails of the first books' fame.This is a bit crass, but I bought this book at a used bookstore and it wasn't even worth the $3.00 I spent on it. Now, when I look at Metallic Love, all I see is a waste of space on my bookshelf. Sorry, but true."
3,"OK Book, Bad Sequel","""Metallic Love"" isn't bad. In fact, if Lee hadn't written it as a sequel to ""Silver Metal Lover,"" I'd say it was a really good book. It's an interesting premise. The writing is (as always when Lee writes) vivid and compelling, with a few surprises and twists. But as a sequel to one of the best SF/Fantasy novels of all time, it falls far, far short. SML was a life-changing novel about the transfiguring power of love. ML is just an interesting read. The fact that Lee toys with the reader by including a character who seems to be Silver, but is not, is particularly disappointing. She would have done better to find a way to reincarnate the robots without making a pseudo-Silver the centerpiece of the story. If you adored SML, think twice before reading ML. It will likely disappoint."
4,Nice but I have some issues,"The price is very nice for a jacket. It is light weight. I wish it compacted more. When rolled it takes up the space of a small pillow. For me as a minimalist backpacker, this is a bit much. My second issue is with the size. I ordered a large because I like dead air space between me and my outer layer, I fit medium. This coat just fits me. That is not much room to put in between layers of clothing. I suppose I should order xl or xxl next time. My third issue is a practice common among western coat designs, the sleeves are tapered at the ends with elastic cuffs. Had the sleeves been open ended as monk or desert nomad design the air flow would dry out the internal moisture created by sweat. The coat could then be used in heat and cold. With the elastic cuff design even in the cold if you exercise too much you get wet on the inside. Clothing designers need to change this shortcoming."
4,Great Gift,"My father loved this gift for his daily workouts (running, biking, swimming and tennis). Seemed a bit cheaply made/construction."
2,Strap is tiny. One button makes setting up a torture.,Strap is really small and barely fits me when buckled in last hole. Strap can not be changed to a longer one. Perfect size for women and children though. Strap can be adjusted to fit almost snugly around my thumb (minor exaggeration). Makes no sense.Initially setting the device up is nerve racking because you have to press the button an awful lot to get the correct settings and it's easy to screw it up. Several buttons would have made it easier and quicker to set.I'm returning this product.
2,"difficult to set, didn't buy it","A local store had these on sale. I spent about 15 minutes trying to set it as I would use it, including going over the manual. I have a Polar Pacer that is now giving up the ghost. But the FS1 and FS3 will not be the one I buy. It probably does an ok job, but I did not like the interface, thus not a rank of 1."
3,Bought as a gift,Do not know yet how the heart monitor is functioning. Will write a review when I get more information.
3,What this product needs,"Well, it does the job, mostly. It's biggest flaw seems to be an occasional anomalous maximum reading for the workout--224 was one example--I'm 59 years old--I'd be dead if it were correct. And I presume this also messes up the average. This seems to be the only way in which the monitor has not performed as it was designed to do.I find it frustrating, though, that I can't see both the stop watch and the heart rate simultaneously. I would also like to be able to record lap readings as I hop from bike to treadmill to elliptical trainer at the Y. But I suppose I should have bought a fancier model if that's what I required. This is really only a ""starter"" model.I still like the design, and I wear the wristband as a watch most days."
4,A good buy for the money,"I'm training for Kilimanjaro, and needed to train a little harder than in the past (to put it mildly). This works pretty well, although I find the watch a bit maddening at times. My experience is that if you go over whatever they say the ""target"" is you begin to get some pretty funny readings. But the chest monitor itself works fine, and the machines at my gym pick up the radio signal and display it. I recommend something like this if you need to get serious--no slacking off with these numbers staring you in the face!"
5,polar fs3 heart monitor,I've been very satisfied with this watch for the last 4 years as I use it to monitor my HR while working out on the bike both indoor and outdoor. Keeps me from slacking off on my effort. After loseing my watch I ordered another one recently. A very good investment.
4,Great basic heart rate monitor,"I have been wanting a good heart rate monitor for some time simply because I didn't trust what the built-in monitor on my treadmill was telling me. This is a great basic monitor! Easy to use and program. Have only got to use it a few weeks so far and the reading seem to be right on. The alarm also helps you keep track of when you fall in or out of your heart rate zone, and the backlight is good for using at night or a dark room. If being an athlete is your job then you may want to look into some of the other Polar models, but if you are doing everyday cardio activities to stay in shape, this monitor is a good start."
4,Great Basic HR Monitor,"Great basic heart rate monitor. Easy to use one-button interface. Includes heart rate, clock/calendar, auto or manual training zone, training zone alarm, exercise time, previous workout memory and backlight. I have 2: one for my bike and one for general workouts. I also bought my wife one."
1,Advanced?!,"This has to be one of the worst books on motorcycling I have ever read. It is billed as ""Street Strategies for ADVANCED motorcyclists"" ... hilarious. The first 70 pages are mainly citations of the statistics of the HURT report from the 80's ...20 year old data. The book goes into great detail about how you can get killed and maimed riding a motorcycle. As an ADVANCED motorcyclist, I am well aware of the risks. The doomsayer nature of the author's presentation makes me wonder if he likes motorcycling ... AT ALL!The advice given for street strategies is sparse and poorly organized. There are hardly any mention of control techniques. The chapter on night riding gives you a feel for the attitude of the whole book. A single page: Night Riding.... here's the advice ""DON'T RIDE AT NIGHT"" ... wow buddy thanks for the advanced tip there.If you want a good book ... Buy ""Proficient Motorcycling"".Save this one for bird cage liner"
1,Poorly written and edited book hides some good advice,"I am pretty sure that Paul Hahn is an experienced, knowledgeable motorcycle rider. Unfortunately that is very difficult to be certain of when reading this book. There are some genuine grains of wisdom buried in mounds of useless, repetative verbage. Statistics are anaylized in a bewildering, confused way that results in conclusions which are tenuious at best. Anecdotal occurances are the substance of the book not the illustrative additions they should be. A ruthless editor, a few illustrations and a hundred less pages would result in a worthwhile and readable book.Should you buy it? I guess so. There are those few grains of wisdom and they were well worth the hours of drudgery to discover. Just take it in small doses."
4,"Ride Hard, Read it well",This book contains some good common-sense lessons for the urban rider. A must read if you want to survive the street on two wheels. I finished it and loaned it to my daughter (a rider herself) and she has yet to return it. Mmmm. It wouldn't hurt to keep it on the shelf and reference it occasionally.
1,A Scary Book if you dont want to ride a motorcycle,"I have read the entire book and have to say that 90% of it is about death and dismemberment. If you don't want your spouse to ride this is the book to give them. It will provide you with every reason not to ride a motorcycle. Lots of stats on injurys, deaths, dismemberment. Very little detail on the joys of riding a bike. I highly discourage buying or reading this book."
2,Little bit of wheat... loads of chaff!,"This book was an aggravation to (try to) read. I did find a few things that were interesting and that I sometimes need reminding of, but hardly two or three paragraphs can go by without Hahn's silly rhetorical questions, cutesy remarks and flippant attitude. (i.e. chapter 7-Riding at Night. Solution: Don't Ride at Night) A better subtitle might have been ""Street Strategies for New/Intermediate Riders"". Writers generally hate editors, but a good editor here might have helped.I think it could have been a helpful read when I started riding almost 40 years and several hundred thousand miles ago, but I'd have to agree with some of these reviewers who seriously question the word ""advanced"" on the cover. At 60 years old, I buy these kind of books to enhance my skills and stay alive, but I think I could have accomplished those goals without wasting my money on this particular book."
1,What a waste.....,"Pure and simple: if you want to learn how to ride, any other book on the market is better than this one. It is a complete waste of time and money."
2,"Poor editing. Biased in a lot of ways, but some good info..","This book is definitely for the ultimate ""risk-mitigator"". There is a good deal of valuable riding safety wisdom, but much more extraneous crap that is, at times, insulted to certain classes of riders. It seems to make fun of people that like to invest money in making their bikes look good, and makes out like all riders should wear orange safety vests and have flashing headlights in order to be responsible and safe. Black leather is ridiculed and people that wear it are all apparently ""bad boy wannabes""! Also tons of boring, hard to understand analysis of stats and studies."
3,"no ""Left Hand of Darkness""","The main weakness of the novel for me, was that the exaggerated reversal of the sex roles was too far fetched and the contribution of the resultant social order in moving the plot along was not well thought out and/or sufficiently explained. (It left me wondering if the author was creatively speculating on the social results of extreme sex role reversal or promoting her own biases). On the positive side, I did enjoy the novel. The plot was sufficiently suspenseful and complex to hold my interest and to keep the pages turning, so to speak (I was listening to an audio version.) The resolution was satisfying."
4,rock and roll is here to stay,one of the great sounds from the great rock/roll years.songs are fantastic BUT quality of the recording is NOT. very compressed range-sounds flat/muffled.kinda brings back memories of listening to tunes on my AM car radio in 1960! OK but could have been a LOT better!
4,Good looking product,The product arrived in good time and connects easily to the bike. The product is very limited to its size.
4,"Great design, but don't get the micro size.","I got the micro size. It's too small to hold a spare tube and the opening ends up under the back of your bike seat so that it's a little difficult to unzip. I would recommend getting the small or even medium. The Aero Wedge series are well designed to fit under your bike and the straps tighten up to hold it securely. I highly recommend this product, but just make sure you get the right size."
1,Parody of a mystery,"I am perfectly aware that different folks like different kind of mysteries, but...My preference for gritty police procedurals and Scotish noir doesn't prevent me from enjoying diverse authors like M.C. Beaton or Simon Brett.But, this derivative little booklet is like a first draft of the small town writing circle. The inanity of the plot, the shear incompetence of everybody involved with the case is distracting. Ms. Bradford must be a romance writer in the making. I just hope she lives the mystery genre well alone."
3,"A quick, enjoyable mystery read","This book introduces newspaper reporter Elise Jenkins and police detective Mitch Burns. As they begin their careers and their relationship with each other, they confront a serial killer. Elise and Mitch are likeable, although Elise both of them tend to blush and weep more than is truly practical for their occupations. The book provides a good story with good characters and a surprising solution."
4,Recipies are fine but the Ideas are better,I flat out don't care for the recipes but the ideas she gives in the book is worth it. If you need ideas for your BUNCO party this book would be for you. It is insightful in that area.
4,"Laughed, wanted more","I listened to this interview on First Voice. I got the book and read it. He's funny and very thoughtful in his writing, which I like a lot. But I gave it four stars rather than five because I wish the chapters were longer. Of course, with short chapters it's an easy read, you can read it in sections. Very touching his thoughts about family, like why he flies the American flag (www.firstvoicebooks.com/marsconservative.html). He is warm without being fake and hard without being fake."
4,Almost great,"This was a neat trick - get a bunch of authors to write a book together, each in his or her own style. It was an enjoyable read, but uneven. After all, you can't possibly put Elmore Leonard's dialogue and Carl Hiaasen's sense of the ridiculous into two succeeding chapters and expect there to be a smooth transition. There isn't. The story is fun, though, and a key point to the book is a fairly detailed index of the authors, which tells us that the characters who are presented in the book can be found in other novels by the many different authors. That's a treat, and I'm sure I'll be picking up some of the novels in which these people first appear. The plot in ""Naked"" is a bit thin on the ground, but you can't really expect this enormously talented group of authors to come up with anything less than a very enjoyable afternoon of reading."
3,"If you don't take it too seriously, it is a lot of fun.","If you are expecting to read a great novel you will be disappointed. What you will find is a group of authors who were just having fun, which makes it an enjoyable read. Have fun with it, pretend you are one of the authors. What would you do with your chapter? What would you do with someone else's characters? How would you add to the plot? Thinking about those questions after each chapter, then seeing what someone else decided to do, made it much more interesting to read"
4,A Fun Read,"If you read too many of these negative reviews, please keep in mind that when buying a book titled ""Naked Came the Manatee"" you shouldn'tbe expecting one of the great classics of the literary arts. You should expect a fun read, and this book provides one. The way the authors change what he previous one had done is entertaining and the story is silly enough that no one should try read as a legitimate crime novel. Also, as a Floridian, I found the descriptions of South Florida to be dead on target."
1,Too many cooks make a mess,"I bought this book based upon Hiaasen's name. Throw in some of the other authors and how could you go wrong? Well, it is a muddled, boring mess. Focus on other Hiaasen titles instead."
4,Another comment,"I forgot to mention something in my previous review. The title of the earlier book back in the 60's was ""Naked Came the Stranger."" The book was actually a hoax written by 25 writers who couldn't get their serious work published, so they wrote something they thought would--a trashy, sex-filled novel. Hence the title of this book, ""Naked Came the Manatee,"" an allusion to the original hoax."
3,Entertaining But Uneven,"Like the waters of Key Biscayne, in and near where much of the plot of this book occurs, this story is choppy. That's to be expected, given the novel consists of 13 chapters, no two written by the same author. Dave Barry kicks off the story, Carl Hiaasen finishes it, and the writers in between are all seasoned Floridian authors of varying renown. Some of the chapters are funnier than others, some better written, and a couple don't work at all. The approach makes for disjointed storytelling at best, and reads more like a series of tenuously interconnected vignettes than an actual story. It's an interesting writing experiment, but one that's been done before and better. If you're a fan of any of these authors or the peculiar inanities of south Florida life, you'll enjoy this book."
2,"Started strong, lost interest half way through","This book started really strong and started dying about half way through. The first half flowed pretty nicely, the authors all had very close styles of writing that made it really enjoyable. About half way through, one of the big characters just disappeared and became a minor one, the styles of writing changed, sex and violence suddenly were added in what seemed like a PG-rated book, and the flow of events suddenly changed and left you confused. At the end, things seemed to make some sense, but at the same time your thinking ""What?"" Started strong, ended badly. Too bad too, I really liked Booger."
2,Nice try,"I'm sure writing this book was a lot of fun for those involved, coming up with ridiculous plot twists without any obligation to come up with a resolution-just hand it off to the next writer.But to the reader it comes off like exactly what it is-a story written by thirteen very different writers. If you have nothing else to read, go ahead and read it...it is moderately entertaining in parts, and it's mercifully short. But I think your time would be better spent reading anything wholly written by any one of the writers."
3,The wonder is that it almost works,"Given the source, the real wonder is that they almost got it right. Chapter to chapter this book ranges from pretty good to simply terrible. If you didn't know how it was made and who made it, the total result is mediocre at best. However, it is worth buying just to see what the next chapter looks like. If you can stand the suspense, wait for the paperback"
2,"A complete mess, but amusing for awhile","Plenty of other reviewers have mentioned the mess that passes for the plot and writing; ultimately this is a parody of a hoax and so good for a laugh in places but offers little to sustain interest. By far the best part of the whole experience comes from the audiotape edition: hearing Burt Reynolds pause each time before pronouncing ""Booger"" with great relish is an absolute treat."
2,Disconnected?,"My whole family is a Hiassen fan (have read all) and that is why I selected this book for my book club. While as a writer, I found the comparisons between the voices interesting, I missed Hiasen's voice. Please Carl, more Lucky Yous and Stormy Weather and..... My book club yawned and went away. And they are mystery fans."
1,This is an awful book,I had hopes for this book knowing that Carl Hiaasen and James W. Hall were involved. The experiment didn't work. The book is awful - a total waste of paper and your time. Read anything else by Carl Hiaasen or James W. Hall and pretend you've never heard of this mess
2,Doesn't measure up,"I was looking forward to this book as many of my favorites are here. All-in-all, though, it was just too cute. The attempt to link many of the familiar South Florida characters was often contrived and not believable. Chapter transitions were more like a kids game of ""telephone"" than a serious attempt to put a solid book together.I've always been amazed when two people can write a book together. The real test of success, IMHO, is if the reader can't tell that there were multiple authors. In this regard, the book fails.The only solice I would get about this effort would be if these otherwise very talented writers took the profits and donated them to a ""Save the Manatee"" foundation."
2,Borrow it,"I was looking forward to reading this book by many very goodauthors, but was disappointed. The story line reallydidn't make much sense to me, too many mistakes. I'm gladI didn't buy."
2,Mistake,"In desperate need of a light read and curious about the multi-author approach used with this novel, I dove into ""Naked Came The Manatee"" with anticipation of the fun and excitement typical of Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiassen writing. The story unravels the mystery behind two heads, both with a great similarity to Fidel Castro that are lost in transport from Florida to Cuba. Each of the thirteen authors writes a chapter of the novel, with Hiassen and Leonard attempting to pull the story together in the final chapters. The characters are odd and criminally inept as most characters in Hiassen's and Leonard's writing but the story is underdeveloped and lacks the immediacy of a great crime mystery. If you have nothing else to read and this book happens to be within reach give it a try. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed."
2,Didn't get through it (I'm a picky reader),"I'll admit, it takes a really good book to keep me engaged. This book kept me engaged for the first few chapters and then grew stale on me. It may not be the case for someone else."
4,The closest you can get to team sports in writing,"OK, thirteen of Miami's favorite writers are sitting around a campfire (this isn't a joke). Dave Barry kicks off a story involving a couple hit men, a manatee, a 102-year-old woman and a box containing the head of Fidel Castro, and passes it to the writer to the left. The next eleven writers circle the story around the campfire in an attempt to blend this motley cast of characters (and heads) into the literary equivalent of a refreshing Miami Beach smoothee.Throwing in monkey wrenches, stranger characters and even more heads-in-boxes in the process, they mostly succeed in creating a wholly unbelievable, extremely offbeat and wildly entertaining mystery. Poor Carl Hiassen (of Striptease fame) is challenged with tying up all the loose ends without playing the Demi Moore card, and succeeds in delivering an ending as strange as a manatee is large.Above all an interesting experiment, Naked Came the Manatee is also an entertaining quick read."
4,One Funny Baker's Dozen,"Last time I laughed this hard about a booger, I was six. Naked Came the Manatee centers around a human-like manatee named Booger. Throw in thirteen accomplished authors, and you have a mystery-thriller like no other.Dave Barry wrote the first chapter, and then each author continued with a respective one, making for a fairly interesting storyline. Each author added his or her own characters, but still managed to fit in the ones from the previous chapters.Yes, there are some holes, and yes, I'm sure it was extremely difficult to follow the previous author's lead, but the book still had a fairly nice flow to it. The wacky plot, coupled with the Florida setting makes the well-written book a real pleasure to read."
4,Naked Manatee,"Very enjoyable book. Surprising to have such an author lineup, one/chapter. Left the mystery a little shallow but a fun read."
3,"Ryan Adams ""Love Is Hell, Part 1""","On this eight track EP, Ryan Adams displays his darker, softer side. While i don't find this album everything and a bag of chips like some, it's definately worth checking out. Some highlights include ""Afraid Not Scared"" and ""World War 24,"" with the cover of Oasis' ""Wonderwall"" being suprisingly good. Dim the lights and enjoy this one.Rating: Three and a half stars."
3,Where's Phil?,What this album really needed was ex-Whiskeytowner Phil Wandscher's awesome guitar work. This is a pretty boring record that lacks any substance. If you want to hear how a record like this should be done check out Phil's band called Jesse Sykes and the Sweet Hereafter and their album Reckless Burning. Maybe Ryan should check it out too.....
2,Not his finest hour...,"Although I'm a big fan of solo Ryan Adams work and Whikeytown, this particular album is just not up to snuff. Songs like Political Scientist and This House is Not for Sale are long-winded and pointless lyrically, and too repetitive melodically. The song Love is Hell just plain sucks. His tribute to Brit pop band Oasis with Wonderwall is better than the original, less whiny, more plaintive. But one song doesn't make an album. If you want to listen to Ryan Adams, buy Heartbreaker or Gold."
2,"Decent, but just not that good.","This just seems like generic pop music to me. Nothing special. I really despise his version of Wonderwall, which is one of my favorite songs."
1,Not his best work,"God, what an pathetic CD. His rendition of the great Oasis tune Wonderwall is simply awful. It made me cringe to listen to it. The other tracks on this one are not a great deal better either."
3,record execs suck,"closer to his old stuff and enjoyable for a Ryan Adams fan. Why they had to split it up into two CD's is beyond me. Another example of greed, no wonder people download"
5,Herschel Brown Complete Recorded Works,I have been a collector of Finer Older Real Country Music for over 20 years now. I have a few songs by Herschel. When I found this CD it was the most coolest thing ever. It featured him at his finest. It covered all his areas of music that I knew and some areas I did not know. I think this CD is the greatest works going. I love it greatly. It is Herschel at his finest. Thank You to the person who supplied it.Diane
4,Good Music,A good album from Doyle and the boys. If you enjoy Bluegrass Music then you will enjoy this CD.
4,make sure u need +size,"Im 5'9"" @ 150lbs so I went for the plus size and they are too loose fitting. Otherwise they are pretty sturdy and attractive and working fine w/ garters."
1,Stay Away From Leg Avenue,"Don't throw your money away on these stockings. They don't fit well, run fast and sag at the ankles. I was extremely disappointed in the purchase of this product. Spend a bit more money on a higher end stocking as you will have to throw these away after one or two times you wear them."
1,Got a run the first time I wore them,"I got a run in these the first time I wore them, they are definitely a cheap material and not made to last. I didn't think they would be, but I had hoped to get more than one wear out of them!"
2,A bit disappointing,I was a bit disappointed that the stockings didn't stay up. I'd recommend buying a garter belt with these.
4,Wish they would go higher,I am a curvy girl. Weighing around 165 and I am 5 foot 4 inches tall. I love stockings that go up to my rear and these don't. They do look cute and they do the job.
2,"cute, but didnt last long",These were deff. cute! But I was dissapointed because I only got to wear them once before the tore. But they were very cheap.
2,Mismatched?,"[Note: I'm differentiating between the ""right"" and ""left"" stocking for convenience's sake. Either can be worn on either leg.]The stockings that arrived were different sizes: the right was smaller and tighter than the left, and did not reach the same place on my thigh. The left stocking had a run in it out the box. I would return it, but it's too much of a hassle to do so. I gave it two stars instead of one because the stockings themselves are nice, and the lace is quite sexy - I only wish I'd gotten a matching, undamaged pair!"
3,Wishing for...,"I love these, they're so pretty and sexy, but I wish they were like the thigh highs that VS has, where there is rubber on the inside of the top so it doesn't slide down on you... Other than that, which doesn't happen often, I love them! I LOVE ANYTHING PINK!!!!!!"
2,Lace Top Thigh Highs,There was nothing wrong with the thigh highs themselves but they are clearly made for women with much skinnier thighs. I think it just may be the lace top that made them so tight up top. I'm ordering the cuban style ones without lace top now.
2,don't recommend,"they are strong material, but they slip and roll at the top which is very uncomfortable while wearing them.the seam at the toes is nice but i can't wear these for very long because they're very uncomfortable when they roll up slide down my thighs, they are tight on me and I have very nice legs_ mrs. bot"
3,hosiery,the items were received by me on time. However the thigh his did not have the band inside them that they usually have to stay up. I need to use a garter belt.
1,Honorable Product,"I bought Leg Avenue Sheer Thigh Highs with Lace Top, and when I received them and put them on I noticed that there was a hole in the top part of the lace. It looked like it had not been sewed on right. I also noticed that there was a snag on the top part of the lace as well, I would not buy from this company again!"
1,Thigh highs,I put my finger through the stockings the first time I put them on :(So I never was able to utilize the thigh highs.!
3,"Pretty, But So Damn Frail","First impression upon taking the stockings out of the package was that it was your standard type of stockings. Upon closer examination, I realized that this stocking was made the old-fashioned way with a thick band going along the back of the leg. I didn't notice that in the displayed photo, but I did not mind. Second, I put the stockings on and it rolled up nicely with just the right amount opaqueness and I immediately notice the pretty lace top. Everything was going well until I rolled on the second stocking. I do not know if the run was always there or just appear as I put that stocking on, but I was sad. This was my first time wearing it and a run had already appeared!The bottom line is that this was a pair of very pretty stockings, but its frailness renders it virtually useless for actual wearing."
4,Very nice.,"It fit's me just fine. Quality wise it's ok for a bargain pair, but I've seen better. Don't expect this to last as long as other pair. They are also on the loose end of fit."
3,Not for small women,"These are very well made, however, being on the small side they were a little too big. They come up too far and aren't very tight. I still like them though, and hope hubby does too!! :)"
3,"Very nice, but don't hold up well","Wish they had some sort of plastic on the lace so they could stay up, other than that they are very nice."
4,A little bit rough for skin,It looks pretty good just feel a little bit rough for skin. I rate it four star cuz it worth the value.
4,A good pair of nylon stockings,My girlfriend likes these pair of stockings.She will be buying more next month.She said they were comfortableQuality product
4,Ok item .,These thigh highs r ok just u do have to be even more careful when wearing those because thy do tend to run easily but thy r very soft and so comfy!
2,"Pretty, but dissapointing","I should have read the reviews before this purchase. I orders a black one and a white one. I tried on the black one and it ripped before I even put it on entirely. Pretty disappointing. Now, I'm too scared to try on the white one. They do look great, however. Went wonderfully with my corset and garter belt."
5,Superb Yul Brynner spy film,"Thoroughly entertaining 1967 spy genre film featuring the suave but tough Yul Brynner and ever beautiful Britt Ekland. The cinematography of the snow covered Austrian Alps is lovely. Filmed on location in Tyrol, Austria. This DVD has bright colors, crisp picture and a fantastic jazzy soundtrack by Ernie Freeman/Stanley Black which should be put on CD. If you enjoy the Bond movie On Her Majesty's Secret Service, you are sure to enjoy The Double Man as well. Highly recommended!"
4,Good and amusing film!,"The Tyrolean Alps work out as the huge background in this predictable and uneven picture, where the charismatic Yul Brynner and the virtuosic director Franklin Schaffner (The planet of the Apes, Nicholas and Alexandra and Patton) brings some additive good action scenes in the snow.When the son of a CIA agent (Don Slater) dies in strange circumstances, this ice- blood agent goes to the very scene of the facts to try to investigate what was really going beneath this ""accidental"" episode but the web spider is about to envolve him before he realizes.There are certain resemblances between this film and the Bond's Under his Majesty's secret service.Go for it."
4,Terrific,"Great 60's action suspense spy thriller starring the Imortal Yul Brynner. Great tone, very overcast, dark and moody. The music helps balance things out and helps keep things light. The plot is fast paced and overall you get what you would want out of this type of film. My only complaint is that Brynner doesn't react the way a normal human being would if his only son was murdered but that might just be me. Close in tone to the Quiller Memorandum released a year prior. I can also see similarities to A Dandy In Aspic but that film is a miss for me as Lawrence Harvey just doesn't have the charisma to pull off the lead."
4,What the heck happened to the credits????????,"Having been a fan of Gundam since its original broadcast run in Japan, I've been waiting for this series to arrive on DVD for longer than DVDs have existed. Has that patience been rewarded? Well, yes and no. The series itself is *wonderful*, and it's great not to have to struggle with it across the language barrier, but... Would it have hurt them to provide the option of subtitles with original voices, for those of us who prefer it that way? And, more to the point for this particular DVD: what the HECK happened to the original opening and closing credits? Previous volumes had them intact, with the original music, songs and visuals. This time we get an utterly horrible, low-budget pistache that looks like it was done on a Commodore 64. Having already bought the next three volumes, but not had time yet to watch them, I sure hope this isn't the first sign of a downward trend!"
4,What a mystery!!!,"This book is about a girl who wants very badly to go on a trip to France, but her grandmother won't give her the money. So she gets mad and goes to her friend's house and stays till about midnight. Then she gets kidnapped and no one believes her. They think she's responsible. So she's trying to prove her innocence. But the kidnappers get caught, and she is sent to jail. When she gets bail, her grandmother is pressing charges.I liked this book because it was a mystery. The author was very specific and it kind of makes you think. I gave this book an 8 1/2 because it could have been better. Some parts could have been more realistic. Everything else was very good, mostly how she explained everything. She (Joan Lowery Nixon) has a great imagination, and I like her work. I would also recommend this book for ages 11 and up because there are some bad words."
4,Kimberly Luna review,"The kidnapping of Christina Lattimore is a very interesting and mysterious book. If you're the person that likes mystery and forensic than this is the book for you. Christina is willing to solve her own mystery with the help of her friend.What I disagree with in this book is that nobody in her family believes that she is innocent. So Christina is willing to prove her innocence and prove her family wrong, with the help of her friend. They are willing to do anything to prove that she is not lying.I think that The Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore is a great book because this is mysterious and interesting. This book is kind of based on a love story. The book is mostly about Christina solving her mystery. When you read this book you would imagine pictures in your head and feel like if your actually there."
4,Suspense at its best!,"The Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore by Joan Lowery Nixon is a young adult mystery. Joan Lowery Nixon has written more than 130 books. She is the only four-time winner of the Edgar Allan Poe Award for best young adult mystery.The Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore is about a girl named Christina who is kidnapped. The person who kidnaps her sneaks up on her in the dark while she is coming home. Christina is kept in an old basement where she struggles to stay alive. The odd thing is that the people who kidnapped Christina feed her and let her take a bath and let her change clothes. When Christina is found and returns home, her parents think that she planned her own kidnapping. Christina tries to prove that her side of the story is true. Will she or will she fail?I would recommend it to people who are ages 11 to 15. The book is both mysterious and suspenseful. I really enjoyed it.-- Madison Bakri"
3,Helplessness,"Helplessness defined my reading experience for this novel. Christina Lattimore is likable main character, and the reader follows as she spends chapters two through eight (pages 21-202) indignant and helpless. Over half the novel I didn't enjoy, because I empathized too much. This reminded me ofMisery; the main character also suffers a life-changing psychologically torturous experience.Christina does overcome her adversity, so the novel makes three stars. Joan Lowery Nixon won an Edgar award ('Juvenille') for this in 1980. Highly recommended to me, but NOT by me. The combination of suspense and helplessness made it mediocre reading, and I'd avoid it unless you like psychological mysteries. If so, don't let the young adult label stop you; I found the mystery itself sophisticated despite disliking the emotional undertones."
5,This book was great!,"I totally loved this book!Is was so good,I can't wait to get more of Joan's books!I read it in like two hours(I read super fast)It was great!I would recomend it to anyone."
4,I have to admit this book was pretty good.,"I have read almost every horror book of Joan Lowery Nixon's, and this one wasn't as good as some of the other ones she has written, such as Spirit Seeker, Secret Silent Screams, or Whispers From the Dead. But it was pretty good. I really didn't understand the ending that much, I think she (the author) could have made it a bit better."
3,"It was....alright, I guess. Not what it was cracked up to be","It was good in the suspense catagory, but it didn't even integrate common sense. No police officer (or relitive, for that matter) would only believe a man over a young girl in the case of kidnapping. The villian wasn't that bright, so it was not possible that he could have just covered EVERYTHING, even if he had been given instructions. The police logically would have found more clues then they did, and the ending should have been slightly more jolting. Plus, the ideas of the parents didn't make sense, either. Cathloic and Protestant are basically the same religion, just differing segments. But it WAS a good mystery, I'll give it that. Not in the kowledge catagory but, as said, in the suspense one."
4,The kidnapping of Christina lattimore,The book was excellent! I couldn't even put it down! The great ending really sets the book off!
4,It was a mystery book,"christina was driving home from a friends house about midnight.A car was following her,she turned onto her driveway,got out of her car,all of a sudden, someone in a ski mask came and dragged her off to the kidnappers house.They hold her for ransom. It is a while before she figures out who they are.They make her sign a ransom note.This can happen in real life.We see pictures of children all over the place. Christina was just a charater in this book, but it could happen to anyone of you out there."
3,Good for Trucks,"I looked around for several weeks before deciding on this creeper. The wheels on this unit are great. My garage has an uneven surface so the big wheels help. The padding is very comfortable. My creeper has the brake option which works great if you have the verticle room. My only complaint is that it is not nearly as low profile as I expected. I have a pickup truck, SUV, and a sedan. Gets under the P/U OK but, I struggle on the SUV without jackstands (and I'm on the skinny side). I find myself using my old plastic creeper when I get frustrated with the fit under my SUV."
5,One of the best albums Ever,"It's obvious that the low star rating of this album is because one person who doesn't know rock n roll has rated this album several times. If you even vaguely like John Mellancamp, you'll love this album. Every song rocks and the lyrics are classic Rock. ""Thundering Hearts"" has one of the most intense guitar riffs, and the singing is awesome. ""Weakest Moments"" is one of his best love ballads and is a great tune to slow dance to. The lyrics of this album are great, as is the music. It bounces back and forth between full blown rock, to middle of the road slightly laid back tunes. This is John's signature album, the one that started it all. Back in 1982 and 1983, every cool person around had this classic, only a nerd or a rapper could find fault with this collection of songs."
3,Its okay.,"This is an interesting album watching John Cougar (he will always be John Cougar to me) develop his style. The over-played top 40 radio songs Hurts so Good and Jack & Dianne are great songs, but the over exposure, unfortunately, seemed to make them cliche pop songs.Frankly, if you have his greatest hits, it renders this album impotent."
3,For the Diehards only!,"This cd was the official begining for Mellencamp. And it shows. Although there are a few gems on the cd, it was not until later in Mallencamps carrer that he released full bodies at work. THe album is good in moments. My advice is to look towards ""uh-huh"" and ""Scarecrow"" to be truly amazed."
1,No closed captions!,"If you are a deaf like me, don't buy that video! This hasn't any Closed Caption so I understand very little about the stuff said there."
4,"Liked the movie, hated Angry Bill","Angry Bill saying with 45 days left in the season and one back in the Wild Card race that the Sox are ""all done, thats it""... give us a break!!!Other than me thinking ""damn, not more Angry Bill"", this was an excellent addition to my DVD collection and was very enjoyable (and hearbreaking yet again to see Boone's homer). A must for any Sox fan"
5,The saddest movie ever,"You defenitely get to feel the excitement all over again but you also have to expierience the agony of Game 7. It was a lot of fun to watch it in the theatre with Red Sox fans. We cheered, we laughed, we cried. It hurt to watch but, I loved it. It's easy to be a Yankee's fan but it takes guts to be a Red Sox fan."
5,Makes You Feel at Home,"This movie is 100% Red Sox, which all their characters except Jim Connors lives right outside of Boston. Living two states away from New England and being a die -hard Red Sox fan stinks. The fans in the movie make me feel right at home and I forget I'm not in New England.This movie is also good because it portrays Nomar Garciaparra as the player he is. This past season has made everyone forget how good, talented, and nice the man is. One of the charcters, Jessemy Finet talks about Nomar and then Nomar talks about how wonderful, Boston and the Red Sox are. It signify's him the the fan favorite: not Pedro, Manny, Tek, Damon, or Lowe;just Nomar.While the movie just isn't the same now that they won, it's still my favorite. Can't wait for the sequel this year!"
3,Worth Checking Out,"This is a pretty good album. It's hard for me to rate because I'm comparing it to the Ed Haley recordings. That's probably not a great idea. Kessinger has a smooth quick bow. I'm not sure if it's the guitarist either, but there's some downright annoying square dance calls that get in the middle of some fine fiddle playing on the album."
2,item size,"The diameter/size of this thermometer/hygrometer is ONLY THREE INCHES !!! The image shown above is actually LARGER than the item I received. I feel deceived.I purchased this item for use in a greenhouse, thinking that it would be around 12"" like any other reasonable normal readable thermometer, but this is like a little toy.There is a reason the size isn't listed above, and that is because the actual size is smaller than the image shown, at least on my 24"" monitor.Vendor should list the actual size in the product description, until then all others will be deceived.I paid $21.xx (inc. shipping) for this little toy, think I will leave it here on my desktop to remind me of how things go sometimes.[edit after ""using"" for a few months]The thermometer never changes, at all. I left it outside overnight while it was 30deg and it still reads 72deg. Total waste of money, zero stars."
4,Great reading to psych you up for trip,"this book is really thorough and essential to any first-time traveller. plus the writer's light-hearted introduction to places makes it less intimidating when faced with the confusing British system for the uninitiated. i got everything i need for the trip, and the only thing keeping me back from giving it all 5 stars is the inconvenient organization of the book that will leave you flipping back and forth for information on any one area."
4,Some Good Info,"I have to admit I am not in the credit collection business. I decided to read this book in the hopes of learning more about the credit system and how creditors work - maybe to get a little inside info. Overall, I ended up finding this book pretty interesting and can imagine it would be a good help to those in the industry."
1,Unfortunately I bought two of her books,"If you are thinking of spending your money here, DO NOT DO IT! As in the other book by the same ""author"", and I use the term loosely, the information is vague and reads as if she has copied information for a (poorly written) school research paper. Spend your dollars elsewhere."
3,Horror Classics Vol. 2 - ID#12249,"Four movies on one disc.Horror Classics Vol. 2 - Platinum Disc ID#12249#1: Carnival of Souls - 1962 - Director: Herk Harvey#2: Chamber of Horrors - 1940 - Director: Norman Lee#3: The Last Man on Earth - 1964 - Director: Sidney Salkow**NOTE** Mislabeling on the packaging, described as a 1924 silent movie.#4: White Zombie - 1932 - Director: Victor HalperinAll in all; decent picture, decent sound. Nothing special, but menus all seem to work and thats rare for cheap compilation DVD's.These movies are available individually from amazon, so you can see actual reviews and movie details if you search for the title under DVD's."
2,bread not bagel,Tasted like a couple of pieces of toast. Anyone who likes bagels should stay away from these.
3,HP XW4400 Workstation Base Unit,HP XW4400 Workstation Base Unit [Electronics]Condition: Used - Very GoodI would not list this unit as very good. It rated a 3 out of 5 stars.The case was discolored form cleaning. Shipped with the wrong keyboard (department store HP keyboard) and Mouse (was a old ball mouse).[...]
5,Amazing story of a hell of an interesting man,"Beyond what the public has seen from Jake Lamottas incredible bouts in the ring, there is much more people should know about Lamottas life. Through this book you will uncover Jake lamottas Physical and mental struggles, whether it be taking a tremendous amount of abuse in the ring and still staying on both of his feet, Or his madness at home with his family and closest friends. He tells his separate problems which included his best friend, his wife(s), and the mafia. His childhood alone as a thug living in tenements in the early Bronx will draw you to read more and soon you will start to understand where all the rage came from."
3,Heavy,"The brush Will work better just one side, the wire one.The way it is makes it too heavy to handle ."
3,OK Brush but pricey - quality not up to price,"This is a good brush but for the money there are just as good products out there for much less. My dog hated it and was afraid when I attempted to brush him. I found out why when I brushed it against my arm. Some of the bristle bunches had been ""fused/melted"" together during manufacture and they were razor sharp...no wonder my little guy didn't like it. I had to get a pair of wire cutters and remove several groups of the bristles so now there is a bald spot. For the money,I would expect better. Go to a local store and buy a good quality cheaper version."
4,Good Brush Good Price,The metal pins on the brush some times pop out when trying to brush out knots. Aside from that its a great brush for the price.
3,Dog double side pin brush,Doesn't really go deep enough on my Aussie.Ended up buying more expensive brush that does a better job but still use soft side of brush
2,Doesn't seem to work with my retriever,"I have a golden and she is shedding like no ones business at 10 months old. I use both sides of this brush and it barely removes much hair. I have to brush her forever to get all the extra hair out where as if i use my cat brush on her, it pulls a lot more hair out. I'll be looking for a new brush."
3,Nothing special,this is a pretty average brush..it gets the job done but my boy does not enjoy it like he does his wood pin brush from Chris Christensen...guess I need to order that one again as his has worn out
2,safari pin&brisle brush for dogsm,"my puppy,a pomaranium,did not like it.it was too rough on her and she bit at the whole time i used it on hher"
4,very nice brush,My shih-tzu loves her brush. On one side it is soft and the other side it helps take out her tangles. I use it everyday. Nice product.
3,Youth Bible Study curriculum,"I absolutely love the Bible (New Century Version) that goes with this guide for working with youth. However a lot of the Bible study ideas are very general and global. Some studies, like the Hebrew Scripture prophets are lumped together and the instrucitons suggest that each pair of youth get assigned one fo the major or minor prophets to scour for the major theme, and then have all the groups write a summary on a sheet of butcher paper that has been divided into the different prophets. Very schoolish and not much fun. I'm a bit disappointed by this book.It does have some good ideas, but it is not up to the creative fun standard that I expect from Group Publishing Inc from this period (1991)."
3,"good, but dated","Book arrived in excellent condition. I like this resource, but it's getting dated. Many of the ideas & philosophies are not relevant for today's teens. However, many are still good and I frequently use it as a starting point for youth group meetings."
1,Caution,"Purchased this watch and regretted it. One of the band pins popped out while I was taking it out of the box. Cheap band and clasp, look elsewhere, this watch is very cheaply made. Returned for refund... which took a while."
1,Total garbage,"After one month the glass fell out. The watch was not abused. Had to have the glass replaced. The paint flaked off the dial a month after that. The cheap material in the band started to tear just a month after that. I called S&W and they said they did not make the watch. They only allowed thier name to be used. When I asked them who the manufacturer was, they refused to tell me. Not helpful at all. Don't make the mistake of ordering this JUNK. Save your money and buy a nice Timex Ironman or a Casio G-Shock."
4,Smith & Wesson,Real solid construction. I have immersed in water many times already and no condensation has occurred. Heavy Duty rubberized band. Good value.
1,Terrible Quality,"So this product claims that its ""Water Resistant to 30 meters/90 ft."" My husband took a swim while wearing it in our pool one week after we received it and it filled up with water, had to have it taken apart, dried and fixed! Do not buy it if you are planning on using it in water."
2,In my opinion... Video editing is just TERRIBLE!,"It's impossible for me to watch this DVD without feeling like screaming. Their playing is wonderful, but the video editing is SOOO choppy. Perhaps it allows one to feel like what it might feel like to have Attention Deficit Disorder - I don't know. The angles and perspectives change every 2 to 4 seconds without ever focusing on one person from one perspective for even half of a musical phrase! Anyone want to buy a used copy?"
4,Best Flea comb ever,Excellent flea comb. No flea can escape. Surprisingly sturdy - no teeth breakages yet after 2 months as is so common with many flea combs.
3,Safari Flea comb is ok,"I got this comb because fleas were slipping through the single row comb I had. With this comb they did not slip through, they got trapped between the rows and then it was really difficult to get them out. I dipped the comb in a cup with water and flea shampoo and that would slow them down so I could manually remove them, and at least I got them off the animal. So it was effective and I am still using it. But it seems there should be something better."
4,LOVE IT,"Love this comb! Have tried others, but this one is the best so far. It's so easy to comb through the cats - doesn't seem to hurt them like other combs and....it gets fleas! Also - good just for grooming."
5,Great Flea Comb For Long or Short Haired Cats,"I have many cats. This comb sailed through their fur, both long and short haired. When I came across a fur knot, I just used the end of the comb to pull the hairs lose, then combed them out smooth. This comb catches twice the amount of loose hair. Also, this comb is sturdier because the body of it is thicker to handle two rows of teeth. You can't go wrong with this comb."
5,This Comb works amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have a long hair cat and I been having a flea problems.I was hand picking a flea before purchasing this comb and the maximum number of flea I can capture is about 5 a day.First day with this comb, I got about 50 fleas! and it's just works amazingly.It'll catch everything in its path.I didn't even know my cat had so many fleas...Works very well with long hair cats.Any cat hair on this comb actually helps trap flea between the two teeth and they cannot jump off from the comb easily.If you have a long hair cat, I recommend brush your cat before using this comb.I would use this comb before giving any medications to maximize the effect.You can almost completely illuminate fleas on your cat with this comb if you keep using for a week.It is very safe.I would use ""Program Green oral suspension"" that kills flea eggs along with Novartis Capstar Flea Treatment Blue Tabs that kills adult flea to complete the treatment."
5,Best flea remover yet!,"I dont normal write reviews, but this ones just a must.Well, I have a Mainecoon, they are known for really thick, silky hair. We got her as a stray and she was infested in fleas. Nothing worked.. Until I ordered this wonderful comb. I found that you have to comb their fur at an angle in order to catch those little varmints. After I found that out, my mom started brushing her and caught 20+ fleas! I would 100% recommend anyone looking for a quick flea remover (that doesn't include chemicals)this product. Don't hesitate, stop reading my review, and go order it!-Ashley. <3"
5,flea comb,"better than great. cara will sit still forever with this safari. it seriously traps fleas between the rows. Also, i keep a cup half filled with water and simple green, then whatever hair and fleas get caught, idrop them into the cup, shake it to cover the critters and they die so fast they can't crawl up the sides of the cup and escape which they will try to do. buy this comb!"
2,Durability lacking,Purchased this to DE-flea my miniature snows-er. The comb metal bristles bent easily in the dog hair. The product is built quite cheap. I would not recommend.
3,"Does its job, but I don't like the double rows.","The flea comb works like it should, except with the double rows of teeth it's harder to get the comb through my cats fur. I have one fluffy cat and one slick cat and it's impossible to use on the short hair cat because I can't get the comb to lift up his fur. It works okay on the fluffy one.I don't see any benefit to having a double row of teeth."
3,Safari Flea Comb,"I bought this for my long haired cat who has fleas and alot of fur got caught in place of the fleas, and with 'double-row's the fleas would get caught between and wouldn't realize their stuck in there. I would recommend the 'Hartz' Flea comb as the best I've tried so far. Catchs tons of fleas and has a nice sturdy good-grip handle. I would give this comb only a '3'star rating. May do better on a shortfur cat, but wouldn't recommend for longhaired, turns into more of a brush."
4,Safari Flea Comb,"As I searched for fleas on my dog, using the comb with the double row of teeth captured the flea in the middle and gave me time to drown it in a cup of water. This is a great way to catch fleas on short haired dogs. Just one flea makes my dog go absolutely crazy."
2,Doesn't work well on long hair,Bought because of good reviews. It doesn't' work well on long hair chihuahua. It misses flea eggs. Went back to using a single row comb and tossed this one out.
5,Best flea comb!!!,"This flea comb is our favorite, by far! My basset hound prefers this comb to other brush products even when there are no fleas. It really gets the loose hairs off of him and it must feel good to him because he always wants more combing with this! Other combs seem to irritate his skin or be too ""sharp"". This comb does capture fleas very well, and we drown them in soapy water. I would buy this comb again and again."
3,Does the job,"It is a small comb, very fine teeth. The teeth are not terribly durable, even his chihuahua's sort of course hair bent a couple of the teeth back. I don't use this one very much and stick to my little plastic flat comb."
1,Not for very short haired dogs,"This comb just doesn't 'grab' the hair on my pug, and slides right over the top of the coat. Not entirely impressed, but I can see where this would be effective on a medium- or long-haired dog."
4,Nice comb,"I bought this comb to get rid of the fleas on my poor cat who had lost a lot of fur due to flea dermatitis. She didn't like it much, probably because it rubbed against her irritated skin. My other cat has a lot of long, thick fur and the comb caught a few tangles, which she did not appreciate. I suppose if one had a cat with a reasonable amount of fur who was used to being brushed and combed, it would probably work very well."
4,Great Product - Simply does it's job!,My cat had a bad flea problem after being outside for a few days. This product (with daily grooming) allowed me to rid him and house of the minor infestation!
5,well I think the cat likes it better,My cat love's to take a bath he's so funny. he isn't one for blow dyer that he can do with out he goes in an out of the house we have feral cats here where he gets his fleas from most of the time so this worked great making sure de-fleaing him that I was able to also get all the eggs now he's so much more happier
3,Doesn't get through hair well,But I liked how it trapped the fleas in the middle and was useful to get out the flea poo and eggs.
4,It works,But it only gets the ones fat enough to get caught It even helps with shedding on short hair animals
1,It's tiny,"The thing it tiny. I mean, really small. Handle's size is to fit maybe 8 year old's hand. I have small hands (I'm wearing size small in my motorcycle gloves) and holding this thing would be like Barbie's brash my younger sister played with many years ago. The whole thing is no longer than the size of my hand. The brushing part is no longer than about 2 inches.I didn't buy it for flea but to be able to more easily brush my dog under his neck. It will be returned to Amazon."
5,It definitely catches fleas!,"Make sure your pet is brushed out well before using this. Then have a big bowl beside you filled with water and a little liquid dish soap. Swipe the comb through the animals fur, then pull the fur & fleas off the comb and drop 'em in the bowl of soapy water. Easy, easy, easy. But the real trick is making sure you brush any & all mats out of your dog or cat's coat before using it. Then it will just glide through their fur and pull out the fleas."
5,flea comb,It works like a gem on short hair cats which is why I purchased it!I would not recommend for a long haired cat.
2,This sucks.,Was not worth the purchase. Since fleas jump it is nearly impossible for this comb to accomplish anything. Will definetely not purchase anything of this sort!
4,Does what it says,It says it's good for coming to your pup and getting all the fleas out and it is that just that it takes here in please enter in everything else out you gotta be careful. Teeth easily broken.
3,it worked,"It worked but it got caught in my cats hair very easily. So that was a pain, but it did what it was supposed to so that was nice"
3,TP holder,This is the only TP holder with a magazine rack that they would ship to an APO. It works and is clean looking. The other ones were much closer to what I wanted.
5,One of the Best Books on Lynch,"Is it possible for a good book of film criticism to be dominated by lavish photos and the like? Not in my experience. The closest to that is the BFI series, and those are hardly the sort of thing ""a reader"" is talking about. Of all the books on Lynch out there, this is probably my #3, behind Martha Nomchinson's amazing ""Wild at Heart in Hollywood"" and the essential ""Lynch on Lynch.""The simataneous release of the paperback and hardcover editions should have clued ""a reader"" into the HC edition being a library edition... Don't let this person's stupidty put you off, this is one of the best books analyzing Lynch one can find."
2,lynch debunk,"I gotta agree with Critic-AL... too much ink is being spilled about Lynch that reads like retread po-mo theories. I'll go with Pervert in the Pulpit too, and I'm not alone. You don't have to be a film student or academic to appreciate Johnson's heady read ... still, I think the review of Pervert by David Lancaster in the latest issue of Film and History totally sums up my thinking: ""There is a slightly malicious pleasure in seeing a modish reputation being debunked, especially when the reader was mystified by the fuss in the first place. Pervert in the Pulpit is not a crude hatchet job, however. Rather, it is clear-sighted and informed, and, in true Manichean fashion, on the side of the critical angels."""
2,adulation or criticism?,"By calling Nochimson's book ""amazing,"" [...]the problem with a lot of Lynch criticism: the audience for his films is divided between fans and serious students of cinema. As Lynch's reputation as an innovator continues to wear thin - face, it, his uneven oeuvre is not aging well - die-hard loyalists continue to gush about his, in my opnion, limited success as a cutting-edge film director. This book may be timely, but it isn't as interesting as Jeff Johnson's iconoclastic ""Pervert in the Pulpit: Morality in the Work of David Lynch,"" which I'd recommend before any of the other, more pandering texts Joe cites."
4,If you're after...Qabalah Fundamentals,"This is a great book for getting the fundamentals of Qabalistic Magick down.By the end of the book I felt I clearly understood the nature of each Sephira, symbols associated with them etc.If you can avoid being put off by the Christian bias and black/white magick attitudes you can learn a lot.You could read this with almost no knowledge of the Qabalistic system and still get a lot out of it.Despite her clarity in some areas Dion Fortune tends to get caught up in unnecessarily long-winded descriptions or explanations if the topic is a difficult metaphysical one. Overall her writing style is beautiful - if a little old fashioned.Read this if you are interested in the Book of Thoth/ Thoth Tarot as Crowley already assumes you know this stuff, it will definitely lead to a deeper understanding of the deck."
5,Excellent is the only word for this book.,"Such great detail, that I'm sure it will take me many, many reads before I even begin to remember what she has written. This really is like a sourcebook for all things Qabalah. Must-have for anyone seriously studying the subject. One word of warning though-- this is not an ""easy read"" Be prepared to *study* this text."
4,Highly recommended book,"There is no way one book could cover all of this jewish traditionhowever, dion fortune has done her uttmost and has provided a beautiful book with fantastic professional ritualsJust short of 5 stars but if i could i would have awarded a 4.5 star ratinghighly recommended book by dion fortune"
5,The best book on the Kabbalah ever,"I have many books on the subject, and this is the best. If you are looking for a very in-depth look at the Tree of Life, then this is the best book there is hands down.She talks about each saphiroth in order, with many pages dedicated to each one. She quotes from the Sepher Yitzirah, which can really shed a lot of light on the true nature of the Tree of Life. This book is the result of a great deal of research.I will say this: I normally don't like books that are written by women, say what you will. But I have to admit that this is by far the best book on the TOL that I have ever seen. Israel Regardie's Garden of Pomegranetes is a close second, but the amount of analytical original thinking that Fortune does on each section makes this one the better book."
1,complicated read,"I found this book to be very wordy- and complicated to read I ended up returning it, I dont know maybe its just not what I was looking for- do your research . Maybe its because I am new to the study- But to me she was very very wordy- I found her going off topic allot- It just didnt grab my attention and keep me there at all."
1,Don't waste your money!,"The amateurish, grainy photos, and inferior reproductions of Jack Fritscher's tedious paean to his notion of hyper masculinity leaves the reader wanting less not more. Even for a sometime-fan of Mr. Fritscher like myself (""Some Dance to Remember"" was a darn good read, though it suffered from a lack of competent editing), these fetishistic images are a major disappointment. There are much better books out there. Save your money for them."
4,Oriental Serenity,"This music is an acquired taste, but it is well worth the effort to do so. The quiet and peacefulness conveyed is almost palpable and may lower your blood pressure and heart rate a few points."
4,Quietly powerful,"The Shakuhachi, a Japanese bamboo flute has a lovely and distinct tone as well as great flexibility in the hands of a good player. I enjoy this album as a way to relax and quiet my mind. In addition, it's very nice music and covers several classic Japanese folk tunes. Quite pretty."
3,value for your money?,"Beautiful music, but only about 30 minutes of play on this cd. I would recommend buying other shakuhachi cd's to anybody interested in this art of flute playing. There's lots of them and they're all worth it."
5,I am very surprised to knowing about this.,"I am Japanese. Even Japanese, recently such instrument is unpopular. Because of new fashion and music and words..some of Japanese young people is indifferent to old instruments like Shakuhachi. Though I am young yet, I listen to such old instrument many time. Because Shakuhachi have very long history, that is the music played by noblemen(Kyuutei ongaku=palace music) before more than 1000 years.Even now, in Koukyo(Japanese the Imperial Palace), there are professional musician for Shakuhachi.Shakuhachi is very important instrument as much as that in the point of Japanese music history.Off course, some of Japanese feel calmness when listen to the sound. in such sense, I think that feeling for sound is the same even if where is countries.Thank you for reading poor writing."
1,guitar moods: the most uplifting guitar classics of all time,Some great songs if they were performed by the original artists. The songs sound like a bad Karioke for the guitar. The person who is performing the songs is very good but this is nothing like the originals. I put the CD's in the corner and will only refer to them for referance. I don't recommend that anyone buy this CD set.
5,A Well Written and Even Handed Account of the War.,"I had the unfortunate experience of taking a college level Vietnam Course that was completely one sided. The course was openly hostile to the American point of view and too sympathetic to the Communists. I am not saying I agreed with the war, but I feel a course or a book on the war should show boths side. I feel Karnow does this in his book. the book is well written and easy to read. Plus it does a good job of showing all the points of view of the war. Anyone looking for a book with a good background and overall history of the war should get this book. Read it and draw your own conclusions."
2,One Sided Book about a Complex Subject,"Karnow's does an excellent job in recording Vietnamese history until he hits the 20th Century. Karnow spends lots of time criticising South Vietnamese and Free World Forces' efforts to give a part of this tragic land a chance at freedom and proserity. However, he glosses over or just ignores most of the excesses and atrocities of Vietnamese Communists. If you buy this book, I would advise ignoring the portions dealing with the time period of around 1919-1975. Its just too biased in this area to be taken seriously."
5,The Best of its Kind,"This book gave me the insights into the political end of a misguided foray into SE Asia that cost nearly 55,000 American lives and millions of Vietnamese. While it doesn't have the gore, it has the facts. And makes me always remember that it's old men who send the young out to die. The politics of this travesty were amazing, but, again, it always gets back to money, even if it's disguised as patriotism. Our best and brightest were wasted in the paddies for little or no reason and then all the horror was veiled in lies. If you want to feel the rot between your toes from months of submersion in the wet and mud or the shock of a tripwire on the trail, read O'Brien or Caputo. If you want to meet the devils who got us there, read Karnow's book.Ron LealosAuthor of Don't Mean Nuthin'"
4,Comprehensive but covered elsewhere,"This book is written in a clear style, and it covers the history of Vietnam comprehensively from the earliest beginnings through the end of the war and a bit beyond the war. However, having read other works on Vietnam, including ""Fire In the Lake,"" the ""Pentagon Papers"" and numerous articles in magazines and newspapers, I found that Karnow did not offer much in the way of information or theories that I had not already gotten from earlier sources. So it is an excellent work for people who don't know a lot about Vietnam already, and who want to read a complete history, but not so good for someone who already has a strong background."
3,AVERAGE OF 5 AND 1 IS 3!!!,"Should you buy this book???It depends what you are looking for...Karnow was in 'Nam as a reporter for 25 years and is probably the most qualified writer alive to write about it. He met with all of the top officials in the south and north Vietnamese Govts and had informants in our own govt to help with details. So if you are looking for a Political history of the war, 'the why we were there and what kept us there' kind of topics, then this is a five star must read. But if you are looking for details on the fighting and on individual battles then look elsewhere because this book has little to none of that. You will find out why and when soldiers were first sent to nam but you will not find out what they did or felt once they were there.Political history = 5 starsMilitary history = 1 star"
2,Why not tell about the communists?,Why we not hear story of the Communists atrocities as much?Why we not care about 3000 killings of innocent peoples by NVA with VC help at Hue?Why speak more on communist killings in Laotian highlands.Pol Pot in Cambodia?God bless America for what try to do in Vietnam.
3,Too Much Ancient History,"This very large and very detailed book spends WAY TOO MUCH time discussing ancient Vietnamese history. For about half the book, the author goes into exhausting detail about Vietnam's history from the 10th and 11th Century. The reader is bombarded with information about every king, queen, prime minister that ever lived. At times, entire chapters are made up of nothing but unpronounceable names of dynasties, princes, and tribes. Only in the final 2-3 chapters (out of 10-11) does the author finally get into the modern day details about the war. Skip the first half of the book and head right towards the last few chapters."
1,Hysterical bombast masquerading as history,I've read everything on about the Vietnam War I could get my hands for the last 20 years and this shrill book stands out as the worst. I sorely regret having spent money on it. If you seek understanding of the conflict check out Sheehan's Bright Shining Lie instead.
4,Worked perfectly,"I had a couple of torn boots on the front calipers. The pistons, seals, and rest of the calipers were fine. I ordered this kit, it came with the boots and piston seals. The boots fit fine, it just needed a little work to fit onto the piston and snap into the caliper.If you are careful you should be able to do this without removing the piston and therefore should not spill brake fluid or let air into the system."
1,Purple at it's worst,"For anyone looking for a good Deep Purple album, this is the worst place to start. This album is for die-hards and completeists only. It starts with the fairly good title track and goes downhill from there. The second track, ""Might Just Take Your Life"" starts with a ripoff of the ""Smoke on the Water"" riff and that's a good indication of the rest of the album. It's a poor parody of Deep Purple. You're better off going to the local bar and seeing a cover band. This was a band on it's last legs. Even Ritchie Blackmore seemed to know it since he quit after this ablum. If you're looking for something other that ""Machine Head"" and ""Made In Japan"" which are their best albums, check out ""In Rock"", ""Who Do We Think We Are"" or ""Fireball"". Even the 1984 reunion album ""Perfect Strangers"" is better than this dreck"
2,"Yeah, Coverdale and Hughes suck",Hold on a second... I just remembered Gillan and Glover sucked too!Oh well.
4,Title track the greatest Purple song ever,"Deep Purple's first album after they ditched vocalist Ian Gillian in favor of future Whitesnake frontman David Coverdale. This album would be considered a mediocre Purple effort were it not for one small thing: The opening title track is simply the greatest Deep Purple song ever done. Six minutes of totally ripping, blazing, electrifying, mind-eexploding frenzy with feverish guitar and keyboard solos all over the place and apocalyptic lyrics, it alone is worth the price and rating of the album. For the rest, there's a couple of decent rockers in ""Lay Down"" and ""You Fool No One"" and a mildly interesting groover in ""Might Just Take Your Life"", but not much else. The title track, though, is all that matters on this one."
5,Best of Mark III version Purple!!!!,"What can I say about Burn? It just totally smokes!! You'd think it would've been over with the loss of Gillan and Glover but not even close. With Coverdale's bluesy vocal style and Glenn Hughes ability to take it to a higher place, it was just beginning. The songs were tight, hard, bluesy and just damn good. Burn, Lay down stay down, You fool no one, mistreated, my personal fave Might just take your life were some of the hightlights here. This ranks up with machine Head, Made in Japan and Perfect Strangers in my humble opinion. This record is just so good. A must buy. Too bad this lineup didn't last very long(typical DP)but what powerful music they left us. Cheers and rock on......"
4,sail away with second best album by dp,"i had this on 8-track,cassette and now cd.burn is my favorite album by deep purple.its blackmore at his finest.who i think is second best guitarist ever after hendrix.the mix of hughes and coverdale on vocals cant be duplicated.favorite songs are,whats going on here, lay down stay down and of course sail away with that wicked sound in the beginning of the track.if i was drifted on a desert island or empty ocean ,this would be one cd to bring.a heavy metal classic !"
4,Purple at crossroads.,"Just one listen to this album will reveal that Deep Purple mk.3 were beginning to change direction,adding an element of soul to their trademark sound.Still this does not take anything away from the excellent quality of this 1974 album."
5,it burns my love,"Yeah, Ian Gillan wasn't involved with this one, and that was a pretty good move since that version of Deep Purple couldn't really add anything more anyway.Now we have a more soulful singer with a dirty voice named David Coverdale. He can't hit the high notes of Ian Gillan, but gets the job done regardless.The title song is the ultimate example of speed metal and a great introduction to people who don't know a whole lot about Coverdale's style. It maintains what made Deep Purple so great while adding a new vocal style.The next couple songs are funky and bluesy, which again, is another brave attempt for a new style. It works quite well.""Sail Away"" is an electric guitar ""sailing"" masterpiece. The rest of the album is funky and quite good until we reach the final song which is an incredibly bizarre instrumental. I like it though."
5,You just gotta have it!,"This is by far one of the most in-depth js books on the market. Not only is it a reference manual but it is also an instructor, step by step. It would help you to understand some of the js language before you dive into this book but the author does attempt to teach, and I feel successfully so.Just about everything that you could want to do with js in regards to the world wide web is covered in here. JS is not the be-all end-all solution but the language picks up where a lot of scripting languages like perl, PHP leave off.If you have enjoyed the power of js with web development and want to get more from it you have to take a look at this book, anybody at any experience level will enjoy it.A great reference and an excellent companion."
4,Very Solid JS Book...,"Although I imagine the reading would be difficult to someone with no prior experience to JS...I may be wrong.My only complaint is that there is lots of info on server side JS...and most programmers don't use JS for that. He could write a seperate book just on server side JS as I've heard programmers mention the need for a book for that.I only use JS for client side programming, and this book is a decent reference and has a good emphasis on cross browser scripting."
3,Not really for the beginner,"If you really are ""beginning JavaScript"", then I wouldn't recommend this book. It's a large, dense volume that goes into great detail. But trying to find, for example, how to do rollovers (image swaps) in the index is an exercise in frustration. Nothing under ""rollovers"", nothing under ""image swaps"", the references for ""onMouseOver"" lead to examples that are too complicated. ..."
4,It's worth it,"I found the learning curve to be rather bouncy. Such as chapter 4 was easier than chapter 2. All in all it's a really good book. By no means a reference book, but a good intro."
5,effecient shortest path to learn javascript,I have read 14 chapters of this book.I think that It use a simple language to let you understand the idea.It gives the reader a good understanding and powerful background about javascript.What let this book is the best among other books that talking on the same subject is trying to give a reader deeply understanding of how javascript works.
1,Quite Confusing....,"This book is for beginners in JavaScript, but at the same time the way it is written is very confusing at times. There is one ""project"" that goes through the whole book, with smaller examples all over. The problem is that the smaller examples really have nothing to do with the book-long project it has you working on. I also found no use whatsoever for 99% of the examples in the book. They are VERY basic, and stuff you don't see very often while surfing the net. I can't imagine why anyone would want to do half of the things that are presented in this book.More advances stuff - server side scripting with ASP & integrating your web pages with databases - is not gone over as in-depth as I had hoped. I think if you really want to learn JavaScript, you need to find a different beginner's guide or an intermediate book on it, not this one."
5,Fast Delivery,"Received the item fast, needed it to complet a project for christmas. It saved christmas and was able to get the project done. Thank You so Much"
4,"great shows, bad mix","The one thing that detracts from this CD set is the poor mix - unlike on the Made In Japan release where everything is perfectly balanced, Blackmore's guitar is, at times, nowhere to be heard in the mix, with the keyboards being louder at times than they need to be. It's unfortunate that the same care that was given to the original release was not to be found here. On the flip side, do we really need to hear Blackmore tuning his guitar at the beginnings of some songs? That's where he should have been mixed out.In any case, an outstanding collection worthy many listens, even though the mix is uneven throughout."
2,You get what you pay for! (TOO MUCH PULP),"I actually bought this from a local seller on Craigslist in great condition still in the box. Does this machine juice, yes, but how much is the issue. After using it a couple times I'm convinced now to save my cash and buy a Breville for serious juicing. I juice 2 -3 times a weeks and the HB is quite lacking with too much pulp left over, so much so that I have to strain it twice before drinking. I also got the bright idea to take the pulp and reinsert it and low and behold the pulp gave me an additional 6-8 ounces of juice. This juicer is easy to assemble and take apart but takes a long time to clean especially the spinning part. Breville, here I come."
1,Don`t waste your money!!!,I am very unhappy with this juicer. It wastes a big amount of fruit and it takes a huge amount of fruit or vegetables to get a small amount of juice.Don`t waste your money on this product. Spend more money and buy better Juicer! I am taking my juicer to Goodwill.
1,Best thing about it is the price,"The port is too small, in order to juice an apple you have to slice it into tiny slivers. The blades are not effective, and most of anything you put through ends up as pulpy mass not as juice. A poor design results in too many channels, nooks and crannies for pulp to get caught in, and it is hard to clean. The time and effort to chop things small enough to fit through the port, to feed them a pinch at a time into the machine, the waste of your fruit and veggies as pulp, and time it takes to clean does not balance out the cheap price."
2,"If you like thick foam, it's great~","I just bought this juicer and now I'm on my way to return it. I find that it wastes way too much produce, and the juice that is produced is thick and foamy. If you want real juice, don't waste your money here..."
1,"Noooo, my fruit, my fruit!.....sob","Don't buy this, don't buy this, dooooooon't buuuyyyy this!!! o_oThis is the first juicer I purchased ever, so when I found all the juice leaking out everywhere, all the fruit being wasted, and the iddy biddy amount of juice that I made after 2-3 hours of juicing, I thought that maybe all juicers sucked. But no, luckily, it's just this one, and yes, it DOES suck. badly.I made about 2 glasses of juice from about 10 pounds of fruit. the juice from the juicer just happened to leak out and fall into the cup, the rest of the juice that should have went into the cup was leaking and oozing out of the top of the pul container. This was also very difficult to clean and terribly noisy."
4,It works fine!,"I bought this last night at Goodwill of all places for $12.99. I don't understand the negative reviews at all. It takes a lot of fruit/veggies to make juice so you will use a lot. I juiced one bunch of japanese kale, one apple and two carrots and got a full huge glass of juice, at least 10 oz. I got a little less juice using two oranges and a banana. The juice is a little foamy but that doesn't bother me. You do have to chop everything small and roll your greens so they are compact. Yes juicers make a mess, yes they are a pain to clean but that is with just about any juicer. If you are on a budget buy this. It does the job! If you want a better juicer fork over the money for a Breville."
5,"Great juicer , Great price !",I love this juicer ! I use it every day its easy to clean and extracts alot of juice. I bought it to see if the juice would give me energy because im sensitive to caffine and it does. It even gives my husband energy and he drank monsters every day until now !
1,Not for serious juicers,"This HB juicer was a replacement for an older one that was recalled. While I do not have some of the leaking problems described in other reviews, I find that this model is not nearly as useful as it might be. The pulp IS still very wet, and therefore you don't get all of the juice extracted. Moreover, much of the pulp remains packed around the cutter basket rather than being spun out into the pulp receptacle. This makes clean-up necessary more often than other juicers, and makes it difficult to grab the cutter basket when removing it for cleaning. Clearly, this low-powered, low-end juicer was made for occasional juicing of fruits, and not so much for a serious juicer who would be inclined to use it more often and with tougher vegetables."
1,Educational? Are you kidding?,"Only if you are teaching propaganda. He may demonstrate that eating enormous amounts of food make you gain weight, but that really has nothing to do (one way or the other) as to whether it's McDonalds, or whether it's chocolate cake from Whole Foods or white bread and cheese from the farm. Fast food is just a convenient ""hook"" for this movie.As luck would have it, my daughter got me to watch a movie called ""Fathead"" recently. I thought it absolutely demolished the premise and conclusions of this movie, and it was far - vastly - more educational and informative.Really, the thought that this movie is the basis for some nebulous educational goal is pretty scary. It is not educational to reinforce comfortable pre-conceptions and received wisdom."
4,As Expected,"This video was everything I thought it would be, humorous with some great facts. I highly encourage it to be played in the ""enhanced mode"" because the pop-ups are very informative."
4,Good video,A little heavy handed but overall this video is educational from a health ed. standpoint. Good look at how high fat/cholesterol diet can affect the body.
1,Just a bunch of Bible quotes,"I was very disappointed in this book. I was looking for solace and answers after the loss of my dog, and purchased this book based on the 2 reviews I saw. It is an expensive book and for the most part it is references to animals in the Bible (something I could look up myself and save the [money]). This book provided me no comfort and I was horrified at the format and writing. The other reviews said it was a must for any animal lover and in reality it is a must only for the deeply religious who will be interested in stories about Balaam's donkey and Noah's Ark. I paged through this entire book and found little else besides exstensive Bible study. This book has been misrepresented in it's reviews and I would discourage anyone from buying it. A more accurate title would have been ""An Animal Lover's Guide to the Bible"""
5,Combined comfort & looks,Love the looks and confort of this shoe. Fit true to size and required no breaking in period. Goes with so many of my summer clothes.
5,"Extremely comfortable, like walking barefoot","I love these shoes and have been wearing them since I was a teenager, I'm now in my early thirties. The comfort hasn't changed- it's like walking barefoot almost. It feels so natural to walk in these, but they're a lot more polished-looking than flip-flops or clunky sandals. I can wear these to work, out to dinner, out to clubs, to the pool and more and I'm always comfortable and look stylish. There are lots of colors to choose from, even in my 11W size. I have flat feet and they are still comfy all day at the end of the day. The price is good, too.On a side note, my mother has severe diabetic neuropathy of the feet and lower legs, and these are the ONLY shoes she can wear- not WANT to wear (though she loves them), but literally, she HAS to wear them. They're that comfortable for her."
1,not good,I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling. These are not it. They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters. I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them. No such luck
1,A real disappiontment....,"This edition of Command and Conquer was a real disgrace. I have played Red Alert 2, Tiberian Sun, C&C Gold, and then this. This was a piece of poorly-animated...well...CRAP. I can't beleive I wasted 14.95 on it. If I were you I wouldn't even't look directly at it."
2,"Fun for the campaign game, but trash afterwards","After the excellent Command & Conquer, I'd hoped Westwood would come out with something just as good as the original. As usual, I was wrong. While the story and FMVs are as good as ever, and there are plenty of units to choose from (including welcome sea and air units). There's just one problem to the game: IT'S A TANK RUSH. Prepare to test your ""strategy"" by seeing who can get more resources to fund medium tank production, because nothing else is worth building for the first 20 minutes. Unless you and your buddy are at the same skill level or you're playing a premade mission where the computer starts out with enough defenses to trash basic tanks, all you'll see is hordes and hordes of them. If you're not going to play this online and just want to try out cool missions, go ahead and buy Red Alert. Otherwise, get something worthwhile like Total Annihilation."
4,Red Alert,"This is a good game but without the new vehicles it's a little tougher. If your a beginner, it takes a lot of practice to start getting it. The graphics aren't super great, but it's a great game. I would recommend checking out the expansion packs Aftermath and Counterstrike so you get new maps and vehicles. Or look at Worldwide Warfare which has all of these and it has C&C gold too."
2,yuck,"Funny that he should mention James Herriot, which was more or less what I was hoping for. Despite a few interesting parts and parts that rang true (I'm also a doc) my overall impression was one of bordom. The book didn't have much substance or deep meaning. Sort of a vague diary which was not of general interest. (With an apology to the author's mother, whose opinion he keeps dredging up.....)"
4,"C'mon BBC, release the rest of the series!","Clocking Off is a wonderful series, based on the first one which is the only one available. Paul (State of Play) Abbott is a wonderful writer and keeps your interest high throughout this series of interconnected lives.Why BBC won't release the next two parts is beyond me. There is a lot of interest on both sides of The Pond.Very frustrating to get so into these characters and then know you can't follow them all the way, even though there are more series rotting somewhere in a BBC vault."
1,Bad foundation brush,"I usually don't review products. However, I am forced to post this review on the Vincent Longo Jumbo Foundation Brush as it really failed to impress me considering the cost. It is already broken and I never enjoyed using it prior to that. It didn't spread well and it was difficult applying my foundation. Infact I am happy that it is broken so that I can justify the purchase of another one. Bad bad brush."
3,Ipod charger and speakers,"You can charge your ipod and listen when this unit is plugged into the wall, or listen with just batteries. The sound is crisp and clean, but don't expect any real bass. For that reason alone, I don't use these speakers anymore. These are small speakers so you can't crank 'em up super loud but they are loud enough. You can plug any audio device into the headphone jack plug-in on the back. The alarm makes a beeping sound that a heavy sleeper, might just sleep through."
4,Well in the right mood...,"Having spent all summer listening to Panic's amazing Night of Joy release I was ready for more great live recordings...maybe my expectations were too high...for Jackassolantern did not quite live up to my hopes...It's one thing to be at a Halloween concert and have the guys play ""fun"" cover songs or at a regular concert and hear a cover song... Those both work well I think... but to have a whole cd of those type songs does not work as well... not that it's bad or anything...almost too much...I found myself wanting a real Panic tune to break things up... having said all that there are some great songs here... Godzilla, Sex Machine & Ball Of Confusion...and old fans will enjoy hearing Michael Houser on some songs...my advice get this and play it at your next party it will fit right in..."
2,too soon,"If you really need usefull info about developing applications for the .Net Compact Framework then you better wait.. Most of the content of that book is off-topic. For example there is less than one page about SQL Server CE Edition but a lot more on SQL Server 2000, actually more wouldn't help either because there isn't any provider for CE. Maybe we should wait to develop on CF, and Wrox should wait until there is something to write about.."
1,Worthless,This book is utterly and completely useless - void of sufficient detail on any subject to be useful. Avoid at all costs.
5,Very comprehensive,"I recently used this book on a tour of mountain bike rides through Washington State and recommend it highly. The route descriptions are well-detailed. I will say that the writing is strangely uneven--some chapters are bland, while others are very colorful. In any case, it tells you where the great rides are, gives you a sense of what your experience will be on the trail, and makes sure you find your way back afterward.The author(s) did a great job of finding amazing rides near Mt. St. Helens. In short: if you ride in Washington, this book is a must."
3,A Taste of Indian Culture,"I would say that the most value this movie has for people outside of India is that it gives a glimpse of the seedier part of Indian culture. It is a story as old as there have been civilizations. Lati, the young girl, is central to the story, but there are several sub-stories. One is of an old couple that a driver is trying to find a hospital for them, but can't find one. Another is about a wandering cat, but neither my wife or I could figure out what that was for; maybe is is symbolic of something in Indian culture. At times, there was moralizing that reminded me of some very early American movies. The move is a bit rough cut compared to the better Hollywood movies, but it is worth watching if only to broaden one's cultural experience."
5,a captivating sheer mystical piano experience,"A captivating sheer mystical piano experience featuring all piano sonatas by Scriabin. You sit down, close your eyes and fly away to nowhere land, where nothing is like you ever imagined before. Spaces beyond space, timeless moments growing towards eternity. Moments of passionate loving and splashes of total horror, frightning you to the bottom of your toes. A mystical vision of times to come, losing all contact with known reality, forgetting who you were, the dissolvement of personnality, one with all that flowes, this is not just music, it's a mystical raproachment to things long forgotten, experience it"
3,"review of Amazon's info, not of book","Why is the publisher's info on this book entirely lacking? It's hard to even tell if this is one book by two authors, or, as is more likely, two texts by two authors brought together for some reason in one volume. Why should Amazon even be allowed to post this item for sale without including the basic sort of info one has a right to expect from a bookseller?"
2,Has MSG substitute and too much salt,"Buyer beware. Although there's no MSG, this contains hydrolyzed vegetable protein. Because of high levels of glutamate, people sensitive to MSG should avoid hydrolyzed vegetable protein (ref. Health Canada, 2009)."
2,very salty with an unidentifiable flavor,I am a vegetarian. I do not eat a lot of mass-produced food. But there are times when you need ready-made stock. I am not on a low-sodium diet and I like salt.This is an extremely salty product with a dominant metallic aftertaste that can make food unpalatable. It ruined a fresh tomato soup recently. It has a very weird taste.
3,Not a favorite,I've never tried the Veggie base before. To me it has a rather odd taste. I probably won't order it again.
3,"Just like their beef variety, careful of the saltiness!","Unable to get to a health products store, I got Better than Bullion vegetable base and the beef base. Both are way too salty if you are watching your daily recommended sodium intake it is listed at 21 percent for the beef variety (reduced sodium) and 30 percent for the vegetable base. It makes me wonder if there other products are this way too.It is something to consider and I've found powdered vegetable broths to be much more friendly in terms of low sodium."
1,ABSOLUTE FRAUD PRODUCT,"I used this product for a few years because i thought it was organic and did not have the junk common to other broths. How false that was. This product is chuck full of MSG, a neurotoxin known for its adverse excitatory effects on the brain. The word Spices means MSG in food industry, so as other crap in it, including hydorlyzed vegetable protein. This product is total fraud and health hazard. Shame on you for your greed."
2,vegetable base,"Vegetable Basewhen i first bought this product at heb or randalls ,it wasn't a sauce ,so i bought this product,then i get it and its sauce,don't like it as well, but i used it anyway, it is good but not the same,taste did change,if i had to buy it again,i would."
3,It depends what your looking for.,"The book gives the formulas for over 70 trading systems to be put into your computer. If that is what you are looking for then the book is great. Myself,I was looking for more how to stuff then math formulas of trading systems. I wanted to know how the systems worked and to have an explaination for them. The book does not do this. Again it gives you the formulas for some trading systems. For me that was way over my head considering I dont have a clue in how to program that stuff into my computer. So again it depends what your looking for."
3,Practical information but opinionated.,"This book describes some practical debugging techniques. The reading is not very heavy. My biggest complaint is that the author appears to carry a big chip on his shoulder regarding the relationship between engineering and marketing, sales, and management. Unfortunately, this detracts from what would otherwise be a good book. Some of the comments made against management and marketing indicate quite a bit of resentment that has built up over the years. This book should not have been the vehicle to express it."
2,Not worth it (at all),"This book was a real dissapointment.I LOVE wrox ASP 3.0 Ref and ADO 2.6 Ref. Maybe Wrox should have taken that approach with this book -- instead of trying to act like this book can in any way teach anything about XML.The examples in this book are horrid, they aren't in depth enough, and more importantly, don't even correspond well with each other.Too many of the chapters jump into the middle of a subject, then try to work back to the beginning and then forward to the end.Trust me, I've read the first 5-7 chapters of this book and finally got so sick of all the ambiguity that I went out to the MS Site and learned more in 30 minutes there than I ever could have with this book.Some of the case studies in the back are nice, and this book would have made a great reference (had they gone that route), but it is a horrible book to learn how to integrate XML with ASP.Save your money."
2,"Bad examples, choppy, dated and not for beginners","I'm a big fan of the WROX publications (for ASP in particular), but this book was a disappointment. The writing was choppy - as you might expect from a book with 14 guys on the cover. The examples were cryptic and raise more questions than they answer.The author(s) seem to me to be attempting to impress us (and each other) with their knowledge of the subject rather than really trying to write a digestible explanation of ways to utilize XML in an ASP environment."
4,"Excellent book, but.............","Ok. This book is very solid. Takes you from little to no XML knowledge to writing some very solid pages. However, there's just one question:Why JScript? Throughout the book, it uses JScript or JavaScript for the ASP code. What's wrong with VBScript? That's what I've always done in the past (and I suspect many people have also), so it seemed a bit odd that the book wanted to use JScript. (I can do JavaScript - that's not the issue. It was just something I found odd.)Other than that one little complaint, a very solid book."
1,MAJOR disappointment,"With a LARGE library that consists primarily of Wrox published books, I'm surprised this one was allowed to hit the shelves. Just their examples of SIMPLY Traversing an XML Tree, they use RECURSIVE Function calls!!! Get real, how about a simple example!!! And I know how to do this, I'm just speaking for the beginner XML programmer who's goingto have to try and understand WHY you recursively calleda function. Buy a different book!!! Because this one [is awful]!"
2,You're better off buying 2 seperate books,"This book tries to accomplish the unaccomplishable. One cannot start to cover the vast amounts of knowlege needed to program ASP and XML, even if the word Professional comes before them.Instead of a thorough book that explains the intricate details that allow the compbination of the two advancing technologies, you end up with a mess of details and case studies. Going through its babbling details you might end up with some nice data validating tricks, but most of all you end up with how to write code that will be re-readable by other people.Very disappointing ..."
1,Too many cooks spiol the broth,"After purchasing this book and reading through the first 7 or 8 chapters I became annoyed with the lack of continuity and consistency. Just look at the cover and see how many contributing authors there are. This makes the book difficult to read and very disjointed. My advice, look for one with less mugshots on the cover."
2,Not worthy,"I don't usually rate things this low, but this book is not a good one for explaining things. Even though it is bulky, I could seldom find topics useful or enjoyable to read, Wrox should really give up the idea of putting multiple faces on a book cover and let whole bunch of different guys with different personality write on the same topic. I give it 2 stars, 1 for it being able to be used as a pillow, the other for its pleasing to scare people with this book on my table"
3,Not the only book you'll need,"Parts of this book are good, unfortunately most of it is only average material, even the case studies (which account for almost half the book) aren't all that great. Lot's of information to sample and get your feet wet. Thrown at you at ""professional"" level, just don't expect to walk away from this one an XML expert.Unfortunately, about a quarter of the content in this book is out of date. XML is like hot lava, it's always changing form, so this book is a good starting point, just do your homework after reading."
4,"Great for beginners, but lack detailed",overall this book was good. however the case studies didn't seem to all follow the same goal of ASP based XML. i would have like more chapters specific to ASP and less case studies.
3,"A Good album, but not what I hoped for","If you are a bigger fan of chorus vocals in your Eastern European village music, then you won't be disappointed. What I had hoped for was a broader selection of instrumental dance tunes, and I took a chance on the cd, uncertain of what I would get in that regard. All in all, though, it is an interesting recording. I just find a lot of the singing diminishes the songs for me, personally. I'll certainly hang on to the cd, though. (And yes, it is predominantly Croatian.)"
4,good band,"This compilation is recorded in 1977, featuring Mark II a line up,..the whole songs are excellent but This cd has been never released in the states and UK,..I found it on LP the german old pressing edition,..but the quality is still good,..I'm very proud cause i found it on vinyl,..cheers"
3,Will the Real Marc Antony Please Stand Up.,"Anthony & Cleopatra didn't grab me like Shakespeare's other works. I don't believe it's his best. Of course, it's still Shakespeare, which makes it better than most and definitely worth reading.Despite the obvious beauty of each sentence, I found the larger picture harder to grasp in this rendering of the famous triangle of love and intrigue between Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, Marc Antony, and Caesar of Rome. Without the benefit of prior historical perspective, this play is difficult to follow, and the character motivations are less clear than his other classics. After finishing the story I'm still trying to understand why Cleopatra so loved Antony. I would not choose this play as the one to introduce readers to Shakespeare. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."
3,need a good amp amybe?,"I hooked these speakers up to a good Sony HU and the speakers were definitely underpowered. Ended up going with the 2 ohm Infinity reference series. If I had an amp hooked up I'm sure they would have sounded better.Please note these speakers were advertised as 2-way at the time, they are 3-way!"
4,Good book - providing tactics for both gambler and investor,As a financial analyst I bought this book to learn about the gambling (or investment) tactics of one of the greates gamblers(investors). There are huge similarities between gambling and investment and this book will give you insights into practial gambling (or financial trading) tactics. The book is well written and I guess also informative for the novice gambler about the importance of knowling probabilites and odds in various games. Enjoy your reading.
5,"One of The First True ""Hard Rock"" Albums","This is, (and with good reason) one of the classic hard rock albums of all-time. It contains such great songs and solos as Highway Star, Pictures of Home, Lazy, Space Truckin', and the legendary Smoke On The Water, which contains what is by far the most famous guitar riff of all-time. If you ever find a rock guitar player who doesn't know it, kindly ask them the direction of the cave they've been living in since 1971. An essential album for any hard rock collection."
3,purple's biggest effort,"A classic album? Yeah, but again, the songwriting is weak in more areas than any Deep Purple album released before this one.""Highway Star"" is the ultimate speed metal song, as many people are aware by now. ""Smoke on the Water"" with its amazingly catchy riff is pure genius as well. ""Pictures of Home"" has the best vocal melody on the album.""Space Truckin"" is NOT very good though, because the vocals are poor. ""Lazy"" is good, but the live version on Made in Japan destroys it. ""Never Before"" has an alright guitar riff, but it's just filler anyway. In fact, this is not an album I recommend because Made in Japan drastically improves many of the songs from this album. Just buy Made in Japan instead."
4,Their best,"As boring as classic rock can be, sometimes it can be great, like this. This is the most famous Purple album, as it should be. It's pretty basic metal (for it's time). ""Lazy"",""Smoke on the Water"",""Highway Star"", and the fantastic ""Space Truckin'"" are the radio hits, and they are the best songs on here, but the others like ""Maybe I'm a Leo"" are all in exactly the same style. If you like what you've heard, you'll like the ones you've never heard of too. It's commercial as hell, but kinda dark too."
4,machine head memories,I had this music as a vinyl disk. Some of the lyrics are dated but the music is still first class.
5,Great music from a hall of fame band!,The rock n roll hall of fame is a joke as long as this band is not in there. Machine Head is one of the best ever. Ian Gillan has the greatest scream in the business and he shows it on this one.
3,DP hits the pop charts,"Billboard liked this one. So did the masses of teenies into the Purple at the time. I personally think they gave something up and compromised. Fireball rocked a lot harder... Machine Head seemed a bit too formulated. But it is DP during that period. Both Machine Head and Fireball have been remastered with additional cuts added, for the most part, on separate discs. It's a great package... I think Roger Glover spearheaded the efforts and I highly commend him for his great gift to the fans. Thanks... enjoy."
1,the second time I've heard this album,"After hearing this album again 20yrs later, it still doesn't go any where."
1,no,led zeppelin was much much better! i don't like this album at all! this was a commecial album! no good songs!
1,a classic...,"of stupidity! smoke on the water have the most stupid guitar rif of the rock history, boring boring boring, but if you like it ok."
1,Deep Purple (Machine Head),Very Poor Quality Download. It does not sound well as you don't get the full quality of the Album. When you buy it on a disk the quality is tenfold and you can install it on your computer unprotected and won't have to pay or loose the rights to it when the store closes or changes its policy. This has happened with me twice.
5,Classic 70's rock,"As a teen in the 70's, i first came across this recording in its raw form on LP. Surprisingly, the band recorded it at all given the circumstances ( they recorded it in a blocked off hotel corridor with a mobile recording unit after the original venue burnt down- hence Smoke on the Water ) and this new version clarifies their sound from way back then, when parts of it sounded a bit muted and subdued.Now, this latest recording separates out the different layers and the movement/ mix between speakers is great.Personally, I preferred In Rock as DP's best, rawest full-on rock, and Made In Japan for the spontaneity of a live recording, but Machine Head is a classic with hardly any weak spots.Purple is renowned as one of the founding bands of hard rock, along with Led Zep and Sabbath and this recording stacks up in all the right ways ! Btw, I still have the old LP ( 33 1/3 rpm ) and apart from scratches, it still sounds good. Rock on !"
4,Deep Purple's Most Overrated Album!,"At first, don't get me wrong - I like this album but I am extreamly annointed by the fact that most people only know the song ""Smoke on the Water"" and maybe ""Highway Star"". Those are great songs but Deep Purple made amazing work with ""In Rock"". Ian Gillian was just perfect for Deep Purple albums in early 70's. He also made excellent work as Jesus Christ in Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Jesus Christ Superstar"". This album has amazing moments, such as my favorite album track ""Space Truckin'"" and also ""Never Before"" and ""Pictures of Home"". ""Lazy"" is a good song but it is too long. ""Maybe I'm a Leo"" is the worst track in this album. I don't like it at all. Although this album has great moments, I cannot understand why it is Deep Purple's most popular album. Check out albums ""In Rock"" and ""Burn"" before you check this album. Those two are real classics!Stars: Space Truckin', Smoke on the Water, Highway Star"
5,this cd is required listening,"If you grew up in the seventies like i did, you are surely familiar with the excellent Machine Head album by DEEP PURPLE. if not you are definately missing out on some primo seventies grooves. The riff that launched a thousand ships in the form of SMOKE ON THE WATER is worth the price of admission alone.featuring the MK II lineup (the classic lineup, if you will)this cd is a tour de force from top to bottom and a fine document of a truly great band settling in to it's rightful place in the pantheon of Rock Gods.The extra tracks are more gravy for the goose!"
4,The sure thing.,"I can remember being a freshman in high-school and going to school dances in Bakersfield Ca, and occasionally going home to the OC and going to church dances with friends, and the pretty girls lining the walls or hiding in the Ladies room, but when ""Smoke on the Water"" would be played, they would all be desperately looking for someone to dance with as soon as the first bar of the song was played.Adolescent boy's prayers were answered.This is still the favorite Deep Purple album for most of my friends 36 years gone by now!"
5,"Guitar ""Riff Rock"" At It's Best!!!","This would have to be on my list of ""must have"" albums. It contains the famous ""Smoke On The Water"" which is played the world over by aspiring 14 year old rock guitarists. Then we have the classic ""Space Trucking"" with it's very inventive lyrics. This band invented ""Guitar Riff Rock"" and their music sounds as fresh today as it was back in 1972. Just listening to this album will make you want to go out and buy a Marshal Amplifier and Fender Stratocaster in the hope that you can rock like Ritchie Blackmore!!!"
5,awesome birthday present,"My 12 yr. old grandson is an ardent music fan, and I wanted him to have a CD and a concerttee shirt that depicted an epic time in music history. After checking with Amazon.com, they promptly sent the beautiful items and now I am truly a COOL grandma!"
3,Thanks for the gambling house fire!,"What would have happened to this album if these guys have had all the recording toys they were supposed to have? (if you don't know the story, the casino where they were going to record caught fire, hence the lyrics in Smoke on the Water, so they moved to a truck equipped with bare basic gear where they record this).It would have probably been a lousy thing like ""Deep Purple with the London Philharmonic"".What saves the album is that ""no frills"" feeling, almost live-playing quality. DP was a band made for immediate sonic impact -the more you listen to them, the less appealing they become. So I guess they should be thankful for the darn fire. The songs are poorly crafted -but at least Gillan and Blackmore were in good form."
1,Worthless. Absolutely Worthless.,"I just received my copy of Audio Fidelity's 24KT Gold version of Machine Head. What a huge disappointment.What a waste of almost $30.The double 25th Anniversary CD mixed by Roger Glover is vastly superior to this release in every single category. Sleeve, pictures, info, etc.And the sound is so much better than this gold thing it's not even funny.I bet that if at this moment I had a way of playing the original vinyl LP I got in 1976, it would sound better too.What a waste of money. What a joke.Stay away from this one, people. Get the 25th Anniversary double CD instead, you won't regret it."
5,"Limited Edition, Worth The Buy......","This double CD set includes both the orginal album remastered and many outtakes, mixes, remixes, with a single b-side, rare quad versions..and unissued guitar solos. Their is also a huge limited edition book inside which roger glover has contributed including many rare photos from the orginal sessions and the story behind the album which produced deep purple's biggest smash hit Smoke On The Water. This album is without a doubt a true classic album worth the buy. Specially in this Limited Edition( double CD set ). Dont buy just the machine head CD buy this limited edition. Recomended!"
4,old time rock'n'roll,I'm very happy with this cd and believe it or not used to listen to the 8-track of this music. Viet Nam was going strong and the country was in an uproar. this album reflects that in it's music. Thanks for bringing it back to an old rocker.
4,great album,"an all time clasic! one the best cds i have ever bought. i love smoke on the water, highway star,and space truckin.if you don't like this cd,then your wrong. .."
1,disappointing mustc,I was dissappointed in this music.I like most music but some tracks on this CD were grating on my nerves.
5,Great Video,This video is a must for any Liverpool fan. Interesting to watch. Slow at times but good. Would suggest this video
5,"Yes, Oh My God, Yes","I probably listened to this album hundreds if not thousands of times when I was in college back in the early 70s. I recently reaquired it and am on pace to beat the previous score. For fans of hippie blues power, this is one of, if not the best albums of all times."
5,John Mayall: The Blue Alone,"This is one of Mayall's best records with the co-production of Mike Vernon which is an out standing combination. It's a very soulful album and has always been one of my favorites ranking up with the Clapton, Green and Taylor recordings. This record is a bit different, it has a very raw edge to it which I have always enjoyed. If you are a fan of Mayall's you will enjoy this gem from 1967. Plus Mayall is a fine artist and nailed the cover art for this disc."
4,Winsome tale of a young girl's early morning adventures.,"When a young girl of about three years old wakes up at dawn, she has to make up her own fun, with her trusty pet dog. Adorable, realistic pencil & watercolor drawings. The girls' antics will be familiar to any family with young children. She makes a few messes and engages in imaginative play before tuckering out in the dog bed with her favorite pooch. Very endearing story."
4,Pleasant suprise,Received delivery in 3 days using cheapest method! Love finding cheap watches that I really enjoy.
3,"great graphics, little depth","I purchased this game and isntalled it. Played it for like 10 minutes and pretty much mastered it. But 4 out of 10 times I play it, it either freezes up, or the game shuts off altogether, and that is very frustrating.But the reason that happens is probably cause I have Windows XP. This game is not formatted to run its capability on XP.So, if you like fishing games, its a good one to get ( if you don't have XP ).good fishin'"
4,Not able to play the game,"I would like to have the game, but it's not for windows XP, so I can't get it. Get some more fishing games for windows XP, and see if I don't buy them."
1,TINY,"The brush is much smaller than I expected. Instead of being the described ""1.5 x 3.2 x 9 inches"" - it is instead just 1 1/2 inches x 1 3/8 x 6 1/4 inches. It's child-size - about half the size described. Someone with large hands won't be able to use it. I have small (male) hands, and it is swallowed in mine. - I now understand the review that complained about the length of the handle, which I didn't understand before ordering.It should be noted that the only favorable reviews refer to use with kittens. For adult cats with an adult fur coat, it is worthless. The ultra-soft bristles won't penetrate into the fur and it won't brush anything out of my cat's fur. - And that's in addition to the TINY ridiculous size. I have tossed it out."
2,The handle needs to be longer and heavier,"The brush is top-heavy and the handle is too light and too short. You've got to keep a decent grip on the handle, or the brush will ""escape"" from you while combing a cat. The brush just doesn't feel balanced at all while holding it."
2,Looks Bigger In The Picture Than It Really Is...,"In my opinion, the brush is too small and the bristles to long and soft to be effective at brushing a cat or dog's coat. It might be ok for puppies and kittens, but not for adult dogs or cats. Bottom line is, the brush just too small. I don't recommend buying this item. I bought it only as a filler to meet the $25 free shipping requirement. But, I expect a better brush."
4,A fun book but by no means exceptional.,I quite enjoyed this book mostly because of the unique characters and the clever writing style that surrounded each. It would have been a 5 star book if it was not so confusing at times. There were moments when the author lost his train of thought and momentum. Worth reading but there has got to be better. The best thing about this book is that it leaves you wanting more (I hate to say) DEATH! (That's not a bad thing).
4,Hogfather: A Novel of Discworld,"Another brilliant book by this author. Having read all of his books (several times)I can't say that any one of them ranks as the out and out best, but this one certainly comes close to being my favourite. Any book featuring DEATH as the Discworld's equivilent to Santa has to be good. His attempts to understand human nature are hilarious, especially when he gets things wrong. Albert is also a favourite character of mine. The scene in the fairy grotto is the best in the book. Definitely a laugh-out-loud book."
4,Clever as Teatime himself!,"Hogfather's my first Discworld book, and I'm not disappointed at all! Pratchett's style is erratic and subtle at the same time, fraught with clever wording and the funniest lines of dialogue. The footnotes are a refreshing bit. Hogfather is a story of belief and imagination, of the dreams and nightmares of childhood. Amazingly deep and philosophical without being boring. The only problem I had with the book is that my Teatime (yes, I've come to think of him as *mine*), the absolutely brilliant - and creepy - villain, wasn't played up enough. He could have been an enduring character! But that excluded, Hogfather is an altogether brilliant work!"
5,I love this book..,"I love this book. Oh, did I mention I love this book?Quite apart from containing Death's granddaughter, Susan Sto Helit, who could make a book worthwhile all by herself, it's REALLY REALLY COOL. That Assassin Teatime is *wonderfully* creepy. I have a Teatime fixation now. And the oh god is amazing as well.. Well, the characters, as always, make or break the book, but the plot here's amazing as well. And where else but the Discworld can you have a storyline that takes you from a child's playroom, to Death's house, to the Tooth Fairy's castle?"
5,Fiction at it's best!,"Terry Pratchett is one of the best authors i've read, and it shows in Hogfather. Engaging, funny, and varied(like all Discworld books) it brings the average reader a sense of genius, put across passively, without you even knowing it. Pratchett is pure genius, and Hogfather is a prime example of his style."
5,Humourous 'till the end,"Humourous situation, humourous HOGFATHER Nice comments Don't miss this one, it's one of the best novels from the Discworld series, if not the best. Read this one, and you want to read the others too (if you have not read them yet)."
5,"Great story, ghastly cover!","One of Pratchett's ""great"" stories! But if you're a true Pratchett nut, go over to amazon.co.uk and get the Brit cover instead. Much cooler. :-)"
5,A fantastic holiday tale and a year round masterpiece.,Pratchett weaves a wonderful plot that will have you laughing one minute and then deep in moral thought in the next.
5,An amazing book,I am a huge fan and I found the Hogfather the best one yet. Death was funny and Susan was good. This book is the best.
2,Not even my airport choice,"This was my first, and accidental, entry into discworld. And while I acknowledged the cleverness of the idea I found the writing fairly ordinary, even sophomoric at times. In a way it reminded me of a cheap combination of the writing of two masters of the bizarre, Tom Sharpe and Douglas Adams. Using my standard criteria of book review; would I take it on a transatlantic plane journey? I find the answer is no."
3,Terry Must Have Had a Bad Holiday,"I just read this one again after a hiatus of about two years, and I like it not. Even more than the Rincewind books, this is the weakest plot, laziest characterization, and least wise & witty dialogue of the Discworld stories, and I've read 'em all except A MONSTROUS REGIMENT. The story is so obvious. Like the Rincewind novels, much of the writing is archly superior, with the usual silly wizards (apologies to Celtic music buffs), the villains painted as utterly idiotic or psychopathic, like Mr. Teatime, and main protagonists, Death and his family, seldom on stage till the second half. It left me wondering what had happened to the humanistic Mr. Pratchett this go-around. Usually I'm very fond of the ""Death"" and ""Susan"" books, but not this one. The last couple of chapters do redeem the story to some extent, but all I can figure is that Mr. P. had a really disappointing Hogfathernight just before he wrote this book."
2,The worst Discworld ever,"I was big fan of Terry Pratchett. His books seemed funny tome. But what he have done with The Hogfather is terrible. Everithing is very confused there and it isn't funny at all. Mr. Pratchett is using the same ideas as in the previous books , nothing is original, nothing can suprise you. I think this is the worst Discworld Terry have written."
5,Perfect Pratchett,"Hogfather is yet another Discworld novel by English humor and satire writer Terry Pratchett. It is just as addictive and fun as all before and after it. While listening to Death, his unwilling granddaughter and the constantly ill God of Hangovers, the story of the missing Hogfather, a figure similar to Santa Claus, unfolds. The main story is incredibly amusing, but equally engrossing are the stories within the story of minor and rather odd Gods, Death's family discourse, and the existence of bogeymen, beasts and wizards.This novel appeals to a wide variety of readers. Each person will extract something different from the story. Younger readers will enjoy the humor while older readers will appreciate the upside down philosophy and satire of Discworld. All that is really required to adore Hogfather is a sense of fun and mischief and of course one afternoon to gallivant with Death's granddaughter, the Assassins' Guild and a whole slough of wizards."
2,"started out great, then went bad","I watched this movie with great anticipation. It is very well acted and starts out great. It's the story of a young Spanish woman who comes to America to star in movies. She has had an extremely hard life and wants to get away from it all. She becomes an overnight star and has everything, except love. She meets and falls in love with a Count and that's where the story goes horribly wrong. Basically, she finds out, on their wedding night, he can't fufill her in marriage, so she has an affair. She gets pregnant, which she is excited about, and then her husband finds out about the affair, but not the pregnancy, and kills her and the man she has the affair with.It was a horrible ending to an, otherwise, great movie."
2,really disappointed,"I thought the screenplay was really thick. The lines were unnatural, and too philosophical."
5,Fav Bogart.,"Great scenes, dialog, atmosphere, cast. Looooove the chemistry between Bogart and Gardner. One of my favorites."
3,OVER THE TOP,"Usual Hollywood formula - rich boy finds poor but beautiful and talented girl, rich boy marries girl, beautiful and talented girl discovers thatrich husband has nothing working below the belt, rich boy finds wife and stable boy in barn together- and shoots them both..."
5,A beautiful romantic classic,"Ava Gardner once called "" the most beautiful animal on the world"" is absolutely fabulous , her whole portrayal as Maria Vargas seems to measure up perfectly through her figure. Stunning , romantic , a delight for incurable romantics. But the end is a bit tragic , you may cry. Beautiffuly shot , and for me te best role of Ava Gardner."
1,Amazon is now shipping its movies in an envelope,"Amazon is now shipping its movies in an envelope.The DVD case often arrives bent. The disc comes loose and scratches.If you keep sending it back, eventually you will get one in good shape."
4,Soft Story to see,Very nice product as far as concerned of Clarity and Sound. Very good 5.1 sound effect.
1,A labor of love to view for Anglophilic cine-masochists,"A turgid and banal melodrama set against the claustrophobic emotional lives of grubby Londoners, a pale depressed lot in gray and depressed circumstances, offset only slightly by several brief scenes of dramatically convincing and explicit rough sex. A labor of love to view for Anglophilic cine-masochists. Not worth more than a couple of dollars used. Rent it."
2,desperation,"Controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors, thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating. But this film showed two desperate, middle-aged strangers (with all their flaws abundantly clear) meeting once a week for no-strings-attached encounters. The fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the ""desperate"", tawdry, pathetic feel of their relationship. Naturally, one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner, one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters: sooner or later, anonymity is not good enough anymore."
3,She did WHAT!!,"""Initimacy"" is not you typical movie, It's not about ""Good looking people"" having sex. Just normal looking people having sex. Maybe if the movie had the ""Good looking People"" it might of been a smash hit.Bill the man that works at the movie store, told me about this film I was looking forward to seeing this.I don't really want to say to much about this movie, but when Kerry Fox went down, yes I said go down on that man. My eyes popped out. I have never seen that in a movie before.I like the expression on his face, when Kerry Fox goes down on him. I hope he drank a lot of pineapple juice. You don't see that in a movie often."
3,"Intriguing, but uneven","""Intimacy"" *is* sexually explicit and raw, but so what? Chances are you've probably seen other European ""art-house"" movies that push the envelope a little further. Besides, the loveless sex scenes aren't really the focal point of the movie -- it merely establishes the setting for our protagonists, Jay and Claire. The story becomes quite intriguing as Jay decides that he wants more than just anonymous weekly romp with Claire, but nothing really materializes at the end of the movie. The movie is uneven and choppy, both in its storytelling and editing, and its subplots and peripheral characters are uninteresting and add very little to the movie. The great Timothy Spall is excellent as usual though. I like him much more in serious roles."
3,Where's the INTIMACY?,"I found this film interesting and most of the characters unlikeable. Jay and Claire are both rather shallow and more than a little cruel. I did however, find Andy sweet and felt his pain, as Claire threw their marriage on the junkheap.For me, the revelation of this film was the SUPERB acting job of Marianne Faithfull. Granted, her character was the only truly innocent and interesting one in the film, but she found all the nuances of Betty...all the pathos and humanity. I've seen Ms. Faithfull's other films and she has really come in to her own with her work in ""Intimacy"". Bravo!"
2,Below average --,"The story is ok, but the acting is a bit off and the movie drags to much... but if your looking for some raunchy sex there is a non-simulated oral sex scene in it."
4,Absolutely recommendable!,"Those who haven't red the book will surely like this film. Absolutely touching and full of drama.In my opinion, the film deviates, in some very important scenes, from the book version and that really disturbed me. Particularly the final scenes. Nonetheless i can absolutely recommend, fans of pure russian realism, to buy and watch this film or at least, to read the book."
2,slooww,"I'm madly in love with Nasstasja Kinsi, I think Tim Hutton is a great actor, and I think Turgenev (who wrote the original novel) one of the greatest writers ever. But this was a slow, slow movie, that I ended up fast-forwarding through."
1,A horrible adaptation that is as bad as a film can be!,"Any time you take an Italian producer,a Polish director,a Czech film crew,French funding and put in American,Italian and Russian actors,something definitely gets lost in the translation! This film is an absolute embarassment in film making,staging,set design,sound quality and acting.The fact that so much of it has been dubbed and that the original Russian novel was translated into a French screenplay and then mutated into English speaks volumes about this ill-conceived mess.Do not waste your money Period Piece lovers.This one is a mess!"
1,wrongly advertised DVD,"I am not reviewing the DVD of the Torrents of spring with Timothy Hutton and Nastassja Kinsky as it is not the production that I believed I was buying. The details on your websight beside the picture on the DVD refer to a production with Charles Housten, Harry H Corbett, Sandra Dorne and penelope horner. If indeed there is a Dvd of the Charles housten Production I would be glad to have it. AT the least Amazon should rectify their mistake."
4,Bitches Brew meets Red...,"This album comprises a wide mixture of approaches and styles. While Bruford has acted in the past as the adhesive element, he now tests further the distinction between melody and rhythm as a product of the drum kit. The band is, however, first and foremost a concert band. Do yourself a tremendous justice by tracking them down, and becoming an actual part of the musical experience. The CD lacks the complexity as well as the coherence the band has been able to achieve while playing live.If you were able to catch the show, you must own the CD. If you missed the show, take a listen to the CD, but you should understand that while it is great, it pales in comparison to the live music generated by the four musicians."
5,I love it,"B.L.U.E is one of the better albums that I heard lately. Chris Botti reminds me Miles Davis at his best, David Torn is a wonderful guitarist, and a leader on the avant-garde, and Tony Levin and Bill Bruford are amazing (Bruford plays a lot of polyrithms here). I love Tony Levin, he's one of the best bass players, but please, Mr. Torn, give us the pleasure of listen playing together Bill Bruford and Mick Karn!"
3,"Oh, well, it's only ten bucks","Im a FS freak. I own six of them(4 of them combat)and I KNOW WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT. First the good news. Its extremely cheap, and has a cool mission builder. The weapons are cool,too. Now the bad news. You only get 1 aircraft. The horizon fade out point is way too near. The damage stinks. The graphics are stone age. The campaigns are extremely hard and each mission lasts an hour without time compression. Your wingman are no help and blare out a cuss word each time you miss."
4,Not The Moody Blues,"But as someone who has all of Justin's solo work I wasn't expecting it to be. First you have the absence Tony Clarke; and Derek Varnals of Threshold Studios, and not all of the tracks were written by him; which does cut the strength overall for this offering. There are moments which rise to level we have come to expect, ""Nearer To You"" ""Crazy Lovers"" ""Suitcase"" and of course ""Forever Autumn - Live."" But for any fan of Justin's I can not see how you would be disappointed."
3,NIGHT FLIGHT JUSTIN HAYWARD,Not a bad album but not as good as his earlier album Songwriter. The best songs are the ones he wrote. There are a few ordinary songs but some good songs lke Nearer to you and A Face in the crowd.
3,Night Flight,"Justin Hayward is my favorite songwriter/performer. This CD was done at at time when he had left the Moodies thereby once again getting his solo feet wet. I think Justin's best work is done with the Moodies,however for the time these songs fit. One other solo that is outstanding is View from the Hill. Again the times are different,he is older.As he says, he writes from the heart.There is a major difference in life experiences he is singing about between the two solos.I still love his work and he is easy on the eyes as well."
2,Got it as a cut out for $3!!!,"I got a deal on this album when it first came out, I bought it as a 'cut out' for like $3 at some department store. Before I say any more, I LOVE Justin Hayward, he is one of my favorites! He can sing, write and is, as some would say, easy on the eye, but this is his biggest solo stinker. With songs that would've been better for Hall and Oats (remember them?) not to mention a kind of weird combination of songs, it had no balance, no direction and it doesn't' sound like he had his heart in it. Many of the songs penned by other artists, it almost sounds like he put this album together and thew it out there because he was bored or something. ""Penumbra Moon"", and ""Suitcase"" are the best cuts on the album. ""Nearer to You"" and ""Crazy Lovers"" are songs he should avoid at ALL costs. I know this was put out when DISCO was big, but Justin Hayward is no KC and the Sunshine band! I'm so glad I got this as a cut out!! If you like Justin, then get it if not pass it up."
3,Lyrically short - Vocally Wonderful!,"Hayward only wrote six of the songs on this collection and each one of them stands up to every song he's done since. The others don't seem to have the range of emotional urgency Hayward delivers so well - perhaps it's because it didn't pen them. However, it's still a great vocal recording and having all his CD's, I couldn't pass this one up and I'm glad I have it. The additional bonus tracks of, ""Bedtime Stories"" is just additional filler, but the live rendition of ""Forever Autumn"" is excellent and hard to find."
3,OK for Hayward,"This is a Jeff Wayne venture (War of the worlds) in which Justin sang ""Forever Autumn"". But no song on the album has the impact of that song. They thought the colaboration would carry on after . This is not the Justin we all know from the Moodies, but his lyrics are still romantic. The best albums are still ""songwriter"" and ""view from a hill"" I'm sorry but this album has no depth."
5,Profound,"This book is wonderful to read and profound. Each chapter begins with a brief sketch of a French woman or women as exemplars of the central theme in the chapter. Zeldin weaves scientific research with historical research to help us understand humanity, both the learned and genetic foundations of human behavior. Communication - the thinking about it, the feeling about it, and the actual performance of it - are at the center of each chapter. The book presents wonderful demonstrations of how the smallest talk can have profound consequences. The chapters are not so much linear as organic, weaving different pieces of data into information and ""aha"" moments of knowledge and wisdom. I carry this book when I travel, and I find something new every time I read it.This book could use an update, but it is not necessary. It stands on it's own. A must read for anyone interested in what makes humans human."
2,too anechdotic,"This book is written in the way of ""Reader's Digest"". Every single concept is refered to as an anechdote, making the reader feel as a moron (""The rain makes the plants grow: a farmer in Illinois..."") I've read foreign critics tag all US literature like this, but I don't agree to that. But this work, oh, boy, sponsors all that statement!I've gone through about 20 pages; then in a renewed attempt, may be 20 more. But my friend, it is beyond my strenght."
1,"Sour going down, bitter aftertaste","These guys really dropped the ball on this stinker. I like Bone because they brought some real vibe music to the table. This album sounds like any run of the mill trash with sub-par lyrics (esp. Layzie) and terrible beats. I mean really, Layzie is a horrible rapper. bizzy tries his best but layzie drags the album into the abyss with his usual terrible rhymes. Avoid.Okay. I'm writing this revision after a couple years since the original was posted. I have softened my stance somewhat on this album. It's still not good by any means but it's not so much that the raps are that horrible. The beats/production still stink and the concepts for the songs don't hold my attention. But the raps are mildly okay, still not good though. Still avoid this album. If you are looking for a good Bizzy joint, I suggest Alpha & Omega. It's a old album but the content is still relevant so you can bang it today like it's still new. I think that's a hot album right there."
1,Crap to the 10th power,"The posters giving this album 4 and 5 star reviews are obviously under the age of 17 or under the influence. Judging by some of these incoherent rambling reviews. This album does not constitute real Hip Hop or even music for that matter. I'm sorry but I smelled a gimmick from a mile away with this group since Creepin'. A friend of mine let me listen to this cd thinking that I actually might like it and want to burn it. Needless to say, after listening to a few tracks I concluded that it wasn't even burn-worthy. If your a real hip hop head you won't enjoy listening to this undecipherable rubbish. Skip this and listen to Nas, Jada, or Common because this is just utter watered down slop."
1,What Can I Say?,"This is an album that you will either love with a passion or HATE. I chose the latter. I could just drive around D.C. with Bone Thugz Greatest Hits in my deck all day. So of course, when I heard the strong single,""What's Friends"" on Music Choice I made the decision to get the album that same day. Unfortunately, that's the only song I bump on the CD. It's is one of my favs, but the rest of the album is SAUCE!!! I didn't understand the pop-hip-hop feel of most of the album, and a good part of it was skits. What the hell happened? Any album that has a Bone-Thugz member should be classic, but... Please, please don't spend yo money on this album, just download ""What's Friends"" and make a mix with that track on it. Enough said, I'm out."
2,What happened to Bone Thugs,This is a major drop off in quality from the old days. Not horrible but not too good either. 2.5Top TracksReal LifeWhat's FriendsEveryday
3,Coulda been better..,"Overall the album is not bad but what's up with the Bizzie's repeating ""Oh my God"" in like every other song? I got no problem with the phrase itself but the whole thing is just distasteful when mixed with hardcore lyrics. I don't know if Bone is changing style or somethin coz this is not the Bone that I grew up listening to. If u want Real Bone Thugs, pick up Krayzie's Gemini, at least he is still himself."
5,Bone bone bone bone bone,What A Cd I Copped this Cd the day it came out and I haven't stopped listening to it yet the only problem i have with it is the fact the layzie and bizzy don't shine enough on their own they have 2 many guest features and the MO THUGS song we can do without but other then that its a classic cd front to back
1,I love BONE but this is GARBAGE,"I have been a HUGE fan of BTNH for years now. I have so many albums of theirs I have lost count. It is pushing 45 albums of solo albums, group albums and unreleased stuff. This however is one of the biggest let downs. One of the all time worst songs I have heard in my life is D*ck Rider. What kind of sewage is that? I was so mad after I got home with this album and listened to it. Like I said dont get me wrong I always have and will continue to support and love BTNH but aside from one or two decent songs on this album it is NOT worth purchasing for any other reason other then to continue to support the group. I do not regret giving up my money for this album since it will get money back to the boys from E 1999, but otherwise it was not a good purchase."
1,Bone Brothers not keepin it up,"Alright lets see i was in sixth grade when faces of death came out and ever since then ive heard bonethugs and LOVED them. Thug world order may have room for improvement but other than that I LOVE THEM. Then came Bone Brothers AND TOTALLY CHANGING THE STYLE. I mean they lost there characteristics which is to me what made them most important icons. A new style th originators how you gonna go copy all of todays BULL. I like one song on this cd ""Everyday"" nothing else is really even worth a mention"
1,Uhmmm...What is this?,Couldn't you all tell by the front of the cd cover that this album was gonna be some mess. I heard as much of this cd as I could possibly bear to listen to. This attrocious excuse for an album does not deserve a three or four paragraph review. So I'll keep it short. My intent is to post my opinion and give my condolences to the fool who paid full price for this mess.
2,What Happened?,This cd has good lyrics but the beats are terrible thanks to Layzie Bone the only bonethug that I dislike. But sides that Bone Thugs are still the best Look out for Flesh's return. Even though this cd sucks they'll come out with a better one then this. But if you want a new sound of the original thugs from the land of the heartless pick up Krayzie Bone's - Gemini Good vs Evil or get the Greatest Hits which has the best tracks of the thugz. So pick em' up!! L8'z for now eternal thugz.
3,What a Joke,"I haven't actually listened to this cd, but I can't even look at the album cover without laughing. It's two guys back to back and it says bone brothers. It looks more like a gay porno then a rap CD"
2,Not Even Close,"The reviewer below me has it all wrong. The problem with this album is the fact that the old Bone flow has disappeared. Most of us were looking for that high speed flow and didn't get it. If you listen to the album, you can understand every word. That wasn't the case before. Bizzy was probably the fastest rapper in the group, but now his flow is pedestrian. Just thought I'd clear that up. If you don't believe me, take a listen for yourself.Peace"
3,wat tha hell has happend 2 dem east 1999 thugs,"Now this album aint 1 of the best albums from a bone, but it was aiight!! da rhymes wasn't has tight as they cud be!! da beats are on the lines of kick back n blaze a sack!! its like bone ave gon soft cos this album is more like the 'harmony' of bone thugs n harmony!!! what happend 2 dat thuggish ruggish bone muzik? where are dem t.h.u.g.s? the fast paced cnt catch a breath rhymes! bone have 2 take it bak 2 eternal tymes, get bak 2 it bone or you'l loose ya thuggish ruggish status!!peace"
1,NO NO NO NO,"Two Words for this bulls**t they call an album: STRAIGHT GARBAGE!!!!!!!! What were they thinking. Bone Thugs are my favorite rap group of all time, but what the hell is this? Every track is horrible. They could've left this CD at the record company. If I could, I would give this CD 0 stars."
1,This album is pointless,"I Agree with of the one star reviews on this album, this album is so pointless and a major dissapointment from two of the members of bone thugs & harmony, there is one good song from the album and that's it.This is a painful experience from the bone brothers.Big thumbs down for me."
3,Early Glimpse Of Greatness To Come,"This is a mere glimpse of the great artistic range that will trademark the Moodies' concerts. Here they sound alittle tentative and unsure of their performance. By the time ""Nights in White Satin"" and ""Legend of a Mind"" arrives, they finally feel settled in; unfortunately the concert is over. The extra five are not bad; they go in chronological order, it seems, of where the group came from and where it was going. ""King and Queen"" and ""What Am I Doing Here?"" foreshadow the inquisitive and brooding nature of their coming works. If you should want a live album, ""Red Rocks"" is better, but this shows the Moodies' early material during a live perforance. Good collection material."
3,A strange and distant time,"This live cd has some rough spots . It has several renditions of the ""hits"". It has one of the worst imaginable Seesaw takes. Whoever put this out should be forced to meditate for about 20 more years or take microdot or windowpane to enlighten themselves. Not bad and then, some real bad music."
2,Beware!,"Obviously a contract fullfiller while the group was on an extended hiatus in the mid-seventies. The live stuff from '69 borders on embarassing and that is mostly do to an uneven soundboard mix where the high harmony vocals that appear consistently ""off"" really stand out. The ""+ 5"" are nothing but studio throwaways.I got mine on vinyl in mint condition used for $1.00. That's a bargain and probably all this album is really worth. No need to re-buy it on CD.Stick with the studio classics (epics) Days Of Future Passed, On The Threshold Of A Dream, Search Of The Lost Chord,and Seventh Sojourn."
4,Classic Time Warp,"This album is a de rigeur purchase for serious Moodies fans, especially if you have only had the chance to see them in concert lately. The tracks on these performances at the Royal Albert Hall compare nicely with the latest live album releases, especially Red Rocks. If you want to hear the Moodies in their prime, listen especially to track one, ""Gypsy"", which will take you straight back to 1969 and the band in their mellotron soaked heyday. It's also interesting to hear the stage patter - even though there is very little, but mostly because it is velvet voiced Mike Pinder doing the talking - it's great to hear his songs performed live, and to hear these classic tracks as they were heard so long ago. You will notice some flubs, and frankly, the band has only gotten better with age. This album catches them at their raw best."
4,"Not a perfect live show, but still worth it","The only real big gripes I have about this live album plus five studio tracks is that they play and sing ""Dr.Livingstone, I presume"" too fast and kind of off key, then with ""Ride My See-saw"", you can barely hear any of the instruments playing at the start of the song. They sound a little off key on some or most of the songs, but it would be hard for them to reproduce something that was made in the studio, I would guess. It's not nearly as bad as some of your previous reviewers made it sound like. The extra five studio tracks are not too bad and I think that eventually I'll really like them, so I guess I can give this a thumbs up, as a whole. It's well worth buying this if you're a completest and want everything the Moody's made."
3,Better than Red Rocks,The first time I listened to this album I focused on the encore track which was awful. I was embarrassed for them. Over time I have come to appreciate other tracks and the overall energy of the band. Gypsy is way better than it sounds in current concerts and Sunset is that rare track that sounds much better live. Sitting Comfortably is excellent and Dr. Livingston is a great rework of a throw away song. My one wish is that it was recorded in 1973 so we could hear the band live at it's zenith. I am told that Just a Singer was done with Ray on the Sax.
4,Early Moody Blues Live,"I saw (and really enjoyed) the Moody Blues in concert in 1972 and 1973, but that was much later than this concert. By the time I saw the band, the vocals were tighter and the band had more stadium concerts under its belt. This CD shows the difficulty of getting three- and four-part harmonies right, live on stage. Still, this is a fascinating look at the beginnings of one of the world's greatest rock bands. Mike Pinder and Ray Thomas were still in the lineup back then and the guys seemed excited to announce each song. Bonus studio tracks from the early years are a plus, if you are wavering on buying this concert disc."
1,The Uninspired Title Should Be a Tip-off,"I love the Moody Blues and I collected all of their records but this is one I gave away. Good points: Interesting but curious cover art, impressive play list. Yes, yes, I know it's ""live"" and somewhat raw but this record is painful and the harmonies are flat and can anybody PLEASE explain to me why ""Legend of the Mind"" has never been performed well since ""In Search of the Lost Chord! "" If you want to hear the Moody Blues live, get the ""Live at Red Rocks"" CD."
4,Moodies written in broad strokes,"Yeah, this version of ""Gypsy"" comes across a bit grunge--but that makes it almost an ""alternate take"" for those who've always written them off as ""soft rock"". I know, the harmonies in ""Nights In White Satin"" are a bit off, but have you ever listened to CSN live? Mike Pinder sings his fabulous pre-world classic ""The Sun Set"" a bit out of breath, but try to resist the temptation to measure him with the yardstick of Justin Hayward's rich baritone. But Ray Thomas proves with this version of ""Dr. Livingstone"" that the song is so well-suited to his voice that he could make it sound good on a bootleg. Plus, ""Ride My See Saw"" is what ""I'm Just a Singer In a Rock and Roll Band"" tries to be in later years but isn't by a long shot--the perfect finale for a band that (no kidding) can rock when it's needed."
3,Deep Purple - 'Come Taste The Band' (EMI),"Review no.60.Originally released in 1975,I always thought that 'Come Taste...' was merely Deep Purple in name only.However,it isn't a bad album.Just sort of tough to consider it AS another Purple effort.Overall,it's an okay '70's hard rock CD reissue.Tunes here I sort of dug are ""Coming Home"",the wailing ""Getting Tighter"",""Drifter"" and ""Love Child"".Line-up:David Coverdale-vocals,Tommy Bolin(R.I.P.)-guitar,Glenn Hughes-bass&vocals,Jon Lord-keyboards and Ian Paice-drums.Didn't realize,that this was the sole Purple album that Bolin played on."
4,One of Purple's (and interim guitarist T. Bolin) best albums,"My hopes were not too high when, in 1975, a Deep Purple album was released without guitar hero Ritchie Blackmore's name attached. Still, as a Purple fan I dared to purchase it, knowing little of the now revered late guitarist Tommy Bolin. I quickly found Come Taste the Band as heavy-hitting and well written as any of the classic Purple albums. Bolin's ability to pen a catchy riff equal Blackmore's, and the combined voices of Coverdale and bassist Glenn Hughes never sounded as clear and enthusiastic. Check out ""Gettin' Tighter"", a funky, guitar dominated Bolin tune, or Hughes' ""This Time Around"" for a welcomed shift of mood. I was pleased to see this CD re-released after several years as an out-of-print memory, and I hope now some interest will be generated by Purple fans to seek something other than ""Machine Head"""
4,only stupid people who saying this album is a bad one!,"well I said, only stupid people who saying this album is a bad one! The MK IV purple line up is a very particular line up. This band had become a huge Dinosaurus through the ages! The songs are becoming timeless and immortal, like you keep on moving, love child, this time around. DP had been beloved by the young and old audiences. Especially their spectacular show on stage! The come taste the band featured Tommy bolin on guitar, replaced Blackmore in 1975, u can also check out the DAYS MAY COME cd rehearsal. It is also avaliable here! the result is brain melting!"
3,"Not the best Purple, but not bad","David Coverdale's third and last Deep Purple studio album also featured Tommy Bolin's introduction to the band, replacing the seemingly irreplaceable Ritchie Blackmore. This album seems to be a totally mediocre effort, that is until one gets to the last two songs, ""This Time Around"" and ""You Keep on Moving"" are both excellent numbers that redeem this one and help it hold its own in the impressive Purple catalog of the seventies."
3,a good album,"this line up was very energically,..Bolin played some heavier songs as Blackmore did,.... but check out the songs like love child,..you keep on moving, This time around ...incredible stuffs"
2,I don't get it...,"I don't understand the reviwes below... By reading them, you'll think this is the best Deep Purple album ever! Ridiculous!COME TASTE THE BAND is not that good, I assure you... Of course, since it's an album recorded by master musicians, it has a lot of quality, but nothing, I repeat, NOTHING in it can be copatred to the best Deep Purple albums!! Coverdale's voice here is annoying, and there are early signs of where he would lead his career after Deep Purple (come on, a Deep Purple song called ""I NEED LOVE!""??!)The best moments are when Hughes sings, sure."
3,"Ehh. It's better than ""Strombringer""","Why does everyone insist on over-rating these marginal mid-70's Purple albums? Yeah, this one has some pretty good tunes on it, but 4 or 5 stars worth? You have to be kidding.It is a lot better than ""Strombringer"" I think because Purple found themselves a genuine funk guitarist in Bolin rather than forcing Blackmore to pretend he was funky. Bolin does add some genuine excitement to some of this material, despite the fact that it is often burdened with iffy vocals from Hughes and Coverdale's typically cliched and silly lyrics.All things considered, you'd be better off with either of Bolin's solo albums. ""Private Eyes"" and ""Teaser"" both leave this stuff in the dust. For that matter, most of Whitesnake's pre-hair metal output is better than this, too (albeit with considerably less intersting guitarwork)."
5,Ritchie Who ?,"In no way am I disrespecting Ritchie Blackmore but, Tommy Bolan is just a better guitar player to me. Most Deep Purple albums have one or two good songs on them,but this album is great from start to finish.Tommy Bolan's smooth guitar playing is so fluid and jazzy as opposed to the previous line up.A five star album for sure."
3,Between 3 and 4 *s.,"When this came out I did not really like this at all.In all fairness I did not relly give it the chance it deserved.Now26 years later I found it second hand and picked it up.(goodmove).I was listening a bit to Deep Purple again and it has really grown on me.I think at the time I wanted Blackmore,Gillan and Glover back in the band and therefore disliked it before giving it much of a chance.Now, dont you make the same mistake."
3,Tommy Bolin in memory,"Mark IV was a particular line up. Besides Tommy Bolin's problem with drugs, Deep Purple has changed musical direction into blues, Funk, Jazz with their traditional Hard Rock sound... You eep on movin is excellent, This time around is a haunted melody full ballad sound,....Dealer is aheavy track, Love child is slow but hard riff! a MUST for Rock fans"
3,Deep Purple going through the motions...,"Hired at the suggestion of Coverdale,Tommy Bolin was never a replacement for Blackmore,but he injected a different type of blood into the band,augmenting the funkier leanings of the previous mark3.Not an essential item in Deep Purple's discography,but thorough collectors might want to own this fairly decent album."
2,cheap box,Expected the type of case that I have been using and seen for years. Very unheavy duty gauge plastic and very poor rear access design as any device in the very top or bottom position has no accessibility to the back panel as there is a big flange in the way. Had to perform surgery on this thing 10 minute after I bought it so I could use it and still had to give up space so the devices would fit and be easily accessible. Way over priced for this. Go elsewhere for a better box.
5,Hootenanny Resurected,"I attened High School from 1962 to 1966 and grew up on this kind of music. So anybody in their mid 50's should enjoy this DVD. You can't avoid singing along while clapping your hands. If you have kids or grandkids you can show them what real music and real singing was in ""your days""!"
5,Dreaming of a local Mommy Fund ...,"I fell in love with this book!! It is a combination of Shopaholic and Motherhood with a twist. What a great idea!! The story and character lines were written so well, I felt like I was actually shopping along with them. I completely related to Kate, she is almost exactly like me. Great novel with a surprise twist ending that brings everything to a COMPLETE full circle and opens your eyes. This is a great book for the tired Mommies to treat themselves with!"
5,How to keep from getting lost in the Arctic,I learned of the Inuksuk when I visited the Canadian Rockies 2 years ago. They were the talk of the shopkeepers since they will be the next symbol for the 2010 Winter Olympics. They represent the markers that were used as landmarks to mark the way in this land of permafrost and snow.
3,Inuksuk,"The description did not indicate that it was a children's/young person's publication, so I was somewhat disappointed. Nevertheless the book was quite informative."
2,Interesting bells,"The music is excellent but the sound quality is poor. You have to turn it up really loud to hear it. The last two tracks, of the four, are the best. The bells are beautifully resonous and full sounding, despite the background fuzz."
5,The Green God,"The song ""The Supernatural"" is why I started playing guitar and was my introduction to Peter Green who went on to steal Mayall's drummer and bass player (Mick Fleetwood and John Macvie) and started Peter Greens Fleetwood Mac which was a chicago style blues band."
2,A WORD TO THE WISE,"A word to the wise here. Check out the 2003 expanded edition, it contains ALL OF PETER GREEN'S CONTRIBUTIONS- enough said."
1,Overpriced,"Now that I have your attention! Yeah, the music is great and every song is a gem (checked it out of a library), but I think that consumers should boycott this and other overpriced CDs until they're remastered and extra tracks are added. This CD is only 37 minutes long and it's a rip off that it's priced so high for so little music. Since a CD can hold 80 minutes of music it's not too much to ask that older works such as this be packed as tightly as possible. There's hundreds of other value-priced CDs out there, why buy this?"
4,Greenie is nothing like Clapton,"Saw the review below, & I must say that Peter Green sounds absolutely NOTHING like Clapton. You can say he influenced him, but the way Green uses his tone & dynamics... added with his singing.... you begin to wonder if Peter Green might not be the GREATEST blues guitarist from England. The old saying of ""more is less"" is the school he came from, & he really makes every note count. I don't think Clapton has/had the restraint that Green had...This album is somewhat inconsistent in its material, but the devastating track ""Supernatural"", will make up for any inconsistencies. The use of feedback on this song is totally different from say.... Hendrix, & it's really... ""worth the price of admission"" as they say. Clapton's Bluesbreaker album is probably more consistent, but the high points on Hard Road eclipses the highpoints on the ""beano"" album. If you ever wondered where Santana got his style from......This album NEEDS to be re-mastered!!! Recommended."
4,"Classic British Blues, Peter Green is outstanding","Granted, John Mayall's vocals are just this side of terrible; it wasn't until his Silvertone releases that Mayall's voice became anywhere near convincing. But that's not what you should be buying this for. You should be buying this to listen to the excellent group playing, and of course Peter Green's guitar. Peter is a more subtle and more soulful player than Eric Clapton, and his instrumental here, ""The Supernatural,"" is the blueprint from which Carlos Santana has built nearly every solo he's ever played. Even though this CD does contain one of the worst versions of ""Dust My Broom"" (here called ""Dust My Blues"") ever recorded, this CD is well worth having for fans of blues guitar, period. Peter Green is the man who B.B. King said gave him the chills, and he never said that about Eric Clapton - or any other guitarist for that matter."
4,A true to life murder mystery!,"An excellently written murder mystery about a one-armed killer who stalks Las Vegas. Realistic and brutal, this page turner has the makings of a true thriller. It is obvious that the author knows what he is talking about in the language and procedures of police investigative work. His style is fresh, compelling and alive. In the ranks of numerous stories of this tried and true genre, this book is right up there as one of the best."
3,Could've been better,"The book was great. However there was some writing in the first page. I wanted to give this as a gift. I had to take that page out. Other than that, I was satisfied"
1,Doesn't perform as advertised,"This is advertised as being a great tool for creating home plans, but the features that you'd want to use are only included in the ""Professional"" version, which is $540. This includes window, roof, split/join walls, wall openings, and others I may not yet have discovered. Of course, once I had opened the software, installed it, and discovered its deficiencies, it was too late to return it. Bummer."
2,Look for something better,"I am an experienced AutoCAD user, and bought this to use at home. If you learned on AutoCAD, you will find this program a study in frustration.What takes minutes on AutoCAD takes hours on Turbocad, IF it will even do it. I'm not talking about solid modeling either, I'm talking about drawing simple, 2D objects, to scale.I'm giving it 2 stars only because it is cheap. But my recommendation is to avoid it altogether."
3,TurboCAD vs. CAD Releases 12/14,"Even after many, many years doing architectural drawings on CAD, I stll find TurboCAD extremely complex. Do you have any suggestions to simplify it's usage?"
1,Terrible,"Awful program. I bought the product in 2009 to help design my basement. It was cheap and looked at the time to be a good product. The most basic tasks are painstaking endeavors and didn't have the time then to put the proper effort into learning the software so I eventually gave up. I decided to give it another shot to and simple things are too frustrating to accomplish. I worked on it for 2 hours and barely had a wall. Scaling is terrible, it feels like you're inside TRON. I gave up. What a piece of crap."
3,Good,"A fun movie to watch, and even a good chick flick, but not the greatest script. The three actors work very well together, and David Schwimmer has some of the best moments. If you enjoy these actors, then this is the movie for you."
5,A meaningful sleeper with an unsure ending.,"I'm not much into the love story thing but this one definately got my attention. I am fully in agreement that true love can't be manufactured or put on in pretense. Just the same, untrue love can't continue without being found out eventually. This was a funny movie that also makes you think. It was not until the last ten minutes of the film that I felt sure of the ending plot, (a rarity in most of todays movies) something I like in a movie. I find it hard to believe that this movie did not go farther in the public. I can surely understand all of the professional reviewers giving it a poor grade. As a general rule, what they dislike, I find to be a good movie and I think the public also. This one slipped by most movie goers."
5,Unforgettable Performance,"Richard Goode's interpretation of Schubert's A Major Sonata is magnificent in every respect. He expresses the work's vast range of emotion masterfully and clearly. The Andantino is especially well done, from the depths of sadness at the start transforming into bursts of rage midway through the movement. The Klavierstuck is a pleasant bonus and showcases Goode's astonishing virtuosity. Highly recommended!"
3,Deer Hunt is no Challenge,This game is not a challenge at all. You can hit a deer from 300 yards away with a rifle. Ridiculous!
3,"Pretty good, but a little harsh","I havent read it in a long time, but my memories are good. I dont really like how it started out, it was harsh and rather slow, but the end was nice. i like how it was an as-its-happening sorta thing not looking back or a patched human observation."
2,Cook-book Style,"This book has a cook-book style. The concepts taught are highly inadequate. Many of the explanations are just explanations of the source code, which occupies half the book. So, in the end, you would probably gained nothing much in terms of concepts learnt.But if you just want the source code that works to paste into your program, then this is a good book to get...."
3,Folding??,"A good, solid cane, except that it springs open if I fold it in thirds. Folded in half, it stays neatly where I lay it. Lately it has become a bit hard to open for folding. Since I've never compared it to another folding cane, I don't know if this is a common problem with folding canes. It is an annoyance with this one."
5,A lifesaver when needed,"Sometimes we need a little help and this product fits the bill beautifully. Not only is it quite attractive--you might as well have a pretty cane when you need it--but it holds up to tough usage. There is no fear of failure with this product and the handle, with its gel grip, is super comfortable. When not needed, it fits into a small bag or medium purse. When injury or age get the better of us, this is the cane to lean on."
4,no Gel Grip,"this cane worked firmly and giggle free for this very low price, but I received a solid black handle not the ""Gel Hand Grip"" as described. the grip is comfortable but thick, so it may not be suitable for people with small hands. the height adjustment has a locking ring for extra safety, but some may have difficulty aligning the lock button, so this cane may not be suitable for visually or mentally challenged users."
1,beware description is wrong,"cane is advertised as ""GEL GRIP"" however there is no gel grip handle. the only reason why i bought it was because i wanted a gel grip comfortable handle waste of time and money. item not as described"
1,"cane pictured is not as described, and cane does not have a gel handle as advertised. Don't buy this cane.","Cane pictured is not as described. Pictured with a wood handle, but comes with a pPlastic handle instead of gel as described. Do not purchase this."
1,Rubber Gel Mess - Stay Away,I bought this for my mother she and I both use canes. I thought that with the features that it has it would be a great cane for the money. Wow was I wrong! This thing has some type of gel that makes the gel grip and it started oozing out of the handle. What a mess not to mention the chemical smell it had. I dont understand why this thing would pass the smell test for any cane user. I tried to call the manufacturer and they were almost impossible to get a hold of. I returned it and hope no one else goes through what I went through when purchasing a cane.
3,"It's functional, sturdy but NOT much more.",The black one has a hard painted handle thus the lower price. That fact is kind of hidden in the description. I only bought it for the 2 day shipping. I also ordered a good walking stick monopod from China but needed something cheap a fast. It is sturdy enough but has no other features like a spiked tip so I imagine the rubber tip will wear out quickly. It's works for a cheap backup.
5,LOVE IT,EASY TO ADJUST-NICE AND STURDY-JUST WHAT I NEEDED TO TAKE PRESSURE OFF MY BACK WHEN WALKING. GREAT PRICE AND SPEEDY ARRIVAL.
3,"The content is excellent, but the editing is poor","If you're looking for a printed resource on ASP scripting using perl, this is the only one you'll find to date. Fortunately, it is filled with valuable information and clear examples (in code) demonstrating how ASP and PerlScript provide efficient solutions to problems you are very likely to encounter. The editing, however, leaves much to be desired. Either the text was translated to English or the author's English was not edited at all for an audience for whom English is a first language. It makes uncomfortable reading for those accustomed to O'Reilly tech books.This book is a good investment, in any case, since you won't find another single resource with the same quantity of information. ...."
2,"Fine, but run hot and then die...","I'm on my third Calypso; he first two died, and this one will too, I imagine. Don't think that I keep buying them because they are great. Buying another was just easy; I have the mount in place, I don't want to deal with going under the dash, and since these are obsolete you can find them cheap. After almost a year, my first Calypso started getting ""No Signal"", but only after it was on for a while. Then, ""a while"" go shorter and shorter, until it only worked for five minutes. If I directed the air conditioning on it to cool it, I could get it to run a while longer. But even that didin't last. SO, I bought another; after a year, the exact same set of symptoms. This time, I bought a ""factory refurbished"" unit, essentially used. It was $20 plus shipping."
4,A far different Cat than i've ever heard (and it's the Cats Meaow),"Cat Stevens did psychedelic music? He sure did and this is that album! Very Donovon-like in style, it was and is interesting to hear Cat Stevens doing a style than i'm not accoustmed to hearing out of him.Is it amazing? Well no...i wouldn't say that. It is interesting AND the music being played is top notch.The lyrics aren't deep at all and are very much light and fluffy and very sixties inspired. All that being mentioned, it doesn't mean you should not pick up the album as it IS quite good....---for THAT kind of music---I love tunes from that era and have always loved Cats voice, so to me it was a no-brainer and something i needed to own."
5,Young Artists Original Work,"I say this album is good, because it shows originality. It was written by a young Cat Stevens at the time when he was in the begining of his music career. It is different from his other newer albums by still a great album. My favorite track is Here comes my baby. If you are a Cat Stevens fan, buy this album considering the fact that it's different with what you're used to."
4,happy pop,"This is Cat Stevens first cd and it's full of happy sounding pop tunes. If your look for more Wild World kind of Cat check out Tea For The Tillerman or Catch Bull At Four. I like this pop sounding Cat, think the best sings are I Love My Dog, Here Comes My Baby and Matthew & Son."
3,ESSENTIAL FOR FANS OF THE CAT,"This early material from The Cat bears little resemblance to his earth-shifting work of the 1970s, but it has its charms. The songs are produced in a way that was typical for a lot of UK hits at the time... so as well as being an important chapter in Cat's career, this disc also acts as a reminder as to why the hit singles of The Beatles, The Stones and The Who were so refreshing. That's not to say the songs are bad-- they're not-- but they do sound 'of a time'. The extra tracks cover all the bases for this period, making it essential for completists."
4,A 'must' for Cat fans,"I say a 'must' because it was Cat's first album - not easy to find these days -and it is always interesting to compare a performer's earliest work with later hits. It contains a few easily recognisable songs and a lot of others that I personally had not heard before. During the first couple of plays I wasn't too sure, but typical Cat - the more you play it the more it grows on you and I love it! I'm particularly fond of Portobello Road (takes me back to the 60's in West London) and Lady. Matthew and Son and Come on and Dance are the tops."
2,Matthew & Son Cat Stevens,"I understand this was Cat Stevens 1st release and much different than his most famous. I just didn't like 80% of it. I will stick to his main hits. Quality was good, and a lot of extra songs.If your a die hard fan then get it, otherwise don't."
4,Compilation of very different recordings here,"Prestige issued its 'Historical Series' in the late 1960s, and this CD is a compilation of tracks from them. Strangely titled ""Bean and the Boys"", since that was the name of one of the LPs - one which featured the Hawk in bop, with Monk and Fats Navarro, the first four tracks on this CD are anything but bop; they come from the ""Walter 'Foots' Thomas All-Stars"" recording, and they are great, but its Swing. Hey, if you don't mind jarring segues from great Swing to a bop quartet (heck, Hawk did it) you should like this reissue. Me, I like my reissues a little more coherent. If you like the 'samples' ""Out To Lunch"" and ""Look Out, Jack"" - check for a reissue of the Walter ""Foots"" Thomas All-Stars, one of the best recordings ever."
4,Excellent reference for CHI design,"excellent reference even if old it has a realistic and complete approach to human computer design, including activity. Much better than superficial analysis like heuristic evaluation."
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL FRAGANCE,"THIS PRODUCT IS PURE ALCOHOL, LOOKS LIKE WATER AND THE FRAGANCE IS NOT THE SAME, I HAVE A 3.7 OZ. BOTTLE SINCE 10 YEARS AGO AND THE SMELL AND ASPECT IS SO DIFFERENT AND REFLECT THE BIG QUALITY... AND THIS, IS A BAD PRODUCT QUALITY, NOT ORIGINAL"
2,"Decent start, but it needs to be updated badly","We used this book for a class that we were running for work. I would say that it is a decent book considering the time it was written, but now there should be better books out there. It doesn't cover code behind until very late in the book which is a fundamental improvement that should've been covered much earlier. Also, there are some errors in this book that are not addresses in the eratta, and the Visual Studio .NET IDE is not covered in this book. The authors use archaic techniques to do things that a VS .NET developer would do in the IDE, like compiling a library file via the command prompt instead of using the IDE to make that library file. Also, it could use some more information in Web Services since this seems to be the main way that Microsoft wants you to create Enterprise solutions."
1,Couldn't recommend this to anyone,"While I have historically been a Wrox Press fan (12+ books thusfar), this book deviates from the usual quality and is overall a complete disappointment.I reviewed this book as an experienced developer seeking .NET materials for my staff. The approach to major topics is suitable for fledgling developers and is generally well stated. However, the overall lack of editing quality - in the form of numerous typos, dangling sentence fragments, and incorrect code references - is likely to frustrate rather than encourage.Perhaps a future, revised edition will clear these mistakes, but the lack of diligence on apprentice material leaves me to consider alternative publishers for ""growth path"" books."
3,"Helpful, but not really","The code ezamples in this book were helpful to some extent. I found it aggravating to realize that variables were never used in the examples. All things were hard-coded, which is not a good habit to get into for the real world."
1,This book is not helpful,The breakdown of the book of this book is not good and did not help me as a beginner
2,Defective item,I was actually glad to see this email. All three of the posters I ordered had some imperfections on them. They were each very cheap so it would cost me more to send them back. I love amazon but said because these paintings are really nice and now what I have is worthless.Is there anything that can be donePhilipPdiaz1020@gmail.com
5,Love this Poster.,"Very good deal for the money, the printing job was quite clean and smooth. Very detailed and large poster. Definitely worth it."
5,a must have for pinewood racing,"The Dr is the man!his design won the best design in my son's pack.the process to build the best car is involved. and takes some tools to get done properly. but if you follow his system to the T your pinewood car will be the fastest in your pack.( make sure to follow the rules of your race n some steps)our car came in second place. now this may sound like a not so good finish, but we had a rule change half way thru the week before the race which forced us to run 4 wheels on the track and with totally unmodifid wheels. others only ran 3 wheels on the track and had modofed/lathe wheels and we beat all of them by a foot or more except for one that only finished .0016 of a second ahead of us on average of 3 runs."
3,Fair to middling,"The only song I really enjoy is the song ""Joy"". That's not to say it's not a good album, but it really wasn't my generation."
5,The Best,"I have loved this book for years and read and re-read it constantly. Love having on Kindle, don't have to carry the huge tome around."
5,Completely Spellbinding,"This is literally one of the best books I've ever read. While it has been criticized for 'over-romanticizing' the Warsaw ghetto, I think that the romantic aspect is important. It helped me, at least, fall in love with the characters myself. The people are well crafted and completely human, from the Nazis soldiers to the Gestapo to the Jews. Mr. Uris not only has a secure grasp on the fine art of incorporating history into fiction, he is also a spellbinding and heart-poundingly good storyteller. This book combines philosophy, history, adventure, tragedy, and romance to incredible effects- I couldn't give it a higher recommendation."
5,THE BEST AND HEAVIEST BOOK I EVER READ!!,"A GREAT READ, A MUST READ, A DIFFICULT READ. I HAD TO PUT THE BOOK down 3 TIMES ON MY COMMUTE WITH TEARS IN MY EYES. This book will give me some of strongest and most lasting memories, and I have read a lot on the holocaust. This time you can really feel for the characters and their plight. Mila 18 can make you hate and runs the gammet on emotions.It is important and we have all heard it before that we never forget, so that we never repeat. But history repeates itself over and over again. similar situations are going on in 1999, just not as obvious.AS THE NEW YORK TIMES SAYS ON THE BACK COVER ""A VERY IMPORTANT BOOK."""
4,educational,"Found this free book in a backpackers hostel in Germany 2002, and was my travel companion on the buses and trains through to Hungary. Being the first such book I have read, I found myself daydreaming about what it would have been like in the 40's in these occupied territories where I was, looking at the old railroad buildings and country surrounds. Definitely worth reading."
5,Life-changing,"This book was introduced to me by a high school English teacher about 6 years ago. I read it in just a view days. It is captivating because the reader feels they know the characters and can relate to one of them or atleast know a person one of the characters resembles. The book is very much about the people involved along with their respective relationships and struggles of being in the ghetto. I know I was mesmerized by this book and am looking for a copy because I lost mine in a move about 2 years ago. If I was only allowed one book to have, this would be it. I have searched high and low and this is the only place I've been able to find a copy. Please read it. It will change your life and if it doesn't, it will change your perspective on life. Very powerful!"
5,T. Martin,great book...bought this for my aunt who read it 30 years ago and was looking for it for her grand daughter....it made such an impression on her that she wanted her grand daughter to read it too....
2,plagerism or not???,"I read Mila 18 then I read The Wall by John Hersey. At first I thought Hersey plagerized Uris! They seemed so much alike with characters and actions. Then I checked the pub dates. The Wall was published first! Did Uris copy (read plagerize) from The Wall? I couldn't find any info on a lawsuit, BUT...I recently saw a quote about ""Uris BASED Mila 18 on The Wall"". I guess that relieves Uris from plagerism problems. Both are excellent books, but I suggest you start with the original, The Wall and see for yourself."
2,"Wet, wet, wet.","I'm really glad I only bought three of these! They were so highly rated that I even bought the matching cover, but I did not like them at all. After only a couple of hours the diaper was soaked through and I mean through! The cover had to be washed as well since the diaper was so thoroughly soaked. That wasn't the worst, though, because I wouldn't mind changing her more often, but the wet was held against her skin all throughout the diaper, even above her legs at the snaps! No wicking at all and I know she was really uncomfortable. Plus at 10 lbs this diaper already seemed too small for her, or very soon would be. Don't waste your money- go for the Bum Genius with the free Super Saver Shipping- it's worth the extra $ by far."
