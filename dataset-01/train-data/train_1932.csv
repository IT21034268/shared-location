2,Not so hot,"This is my 3rd martial arts dictionary. I'm not that impressed. The book is largely devoted to more full explanations of the terms used in various arts. But it's hardly encompassing. In fact, there are so many items left out that I'm left wondering why it wasn't 3 times it's size. There's certainly enough source material!I have another Martial Arts dictionary which is tiny (not quite as thick and about 1/4 the size) with 10 times the number of terms and they are fairly well explained in there. I like reference material, so this will probably get a 2.5 in reality, but I'm rounding down for lack of depth. The explanations are quite nice, however, so if that's what you are looking for, you will be happy. It does, at least, cover some phrases as well as words.If, like me, you are looking for a real dictionary with a ton of entries and hopefully as many phrases, as they say in Star Wars: ""move along"""
2,"OK, but not great","They look cute, but the towel is scratchy and does not absorb water. It's also really staticy and sticks to itself all the time. Would NOT recommend."
3,Good,I feel this work is a good step from which people being interested in learning about ancient maritime and ships history may depart to deeply investigate this fascinating matter.
4,Pretty Pictures and Play on Words.,"This story is about a young Penguin named Milo. Milo's about to have a baby brother. However, mother has to leave home on a food expedition and father needs to deliver the mail. Somebody has to sit on the egg. Father wants Milo to, but Milo wants to deliver the mail instead. So, Milo sets off an a journey delivering packages to all sorts of residents. He has a grand adventure and returns home for a surprise.This is a nice, little story. I love penguins and I enjoyed reading through this book. However, it does contain a hole in the plot that will probably confuse readers (I still don't understand how the egg ended up in the bag). However, the pictures are vivid and colorful and the addresses on each package are filled with clever word play that slightly older children will love figuring out. Recommended for early elementary students."
1,Beware: These are minature wratches,"It's true these are gearless ratchets, but the ad is very misleading in my opinion. You need to realize that the photo is approximately ACTUAL SIZE and these ratchets basically useless!!!The 3/8-inch ratchet is only 4 inches long end-to-end.The 1/4-inch ratchet is a mere 3 inches long end-to-end.These are toys that a kid might play with, not a tool for a real mechanic.That is not made clear in the specifications which misleadingly say, ""Length: 5.30 inches; Width: 8.50 inches"". Turns out that is the dimensions of the carton they come in."
1,Roadie- where's the story,I didn't feel the book lived up to what i thought it was going to be about.I found it to be very boring and talking to much about lighting and things we didn't need to know about.
2,"you can buy better but, you can't pay more",Cabela's is one of the most expensive stores on the planet....they also engage in price fixing with vendors from the way it looks.
1,Not worth it...,"I was exctited to see this available and I was also encouraged to hear Walter Cronkite again, remembering the days of his desk job that Dan Rather took over. For a quick run through of the century, I would suggest another survey. This one groups things in strange ways, and is too quick for it to be worth while. Sorry Walter, this just is not as good as it could have been."
4,Good book shelf,"I bought this for my son to use in his locker at school. He really likes it to help separate his books. It seems to be pretty sturdy. It came in bent, but we straightened it up some and it is working fine. For lockers at school, I think it is a great option."
2,Didn't fit my gym locker,This shelf may be good for school lockers or other lockers but it didn't fit well in my gym locker. We would have returned it but the seller states in their profile that they do not cover shipping for any reason.
4,Upside Down Duster,"When I bought initially bought this duster I had the same glogging/clumping problems, and poor performance that was mentioned in some of the reviews. That was when I was using the duster right side up, with the powder container down and the wand up. (Yes, there are no instructions on the cardboard over wrap. I guess they figured it was so simple a cave man could do it.) After multiple tries I thought, why not try it upside down- with the powder container on top and the wand underneath. It worked! With the reservoir on top it provided a smooth , even layer of Sevin dust without clogging.Judy"
5,Chapin 16 ounce duster,It is a little cheeply constructed but it works great I would not recommend for professional use but great for small jobs around the house. If your shopping for a duster you found a good one for small jobs the price is very reasonable. If you plan to use alot or for professional use spend a little mre and get a better one. I hope this review tells more than I had to go on . I am happy with it for less than $20.00 but some people were selling same thing for just under $40.00 and wanted shipping on top of that. I would have felt cheated at anything over $25.00 to $30.00 so take a few minutes to decide how much you plan to use it before you buy.
5,Works great!,"I've been using this with Diatomaceous Earth in my chicken coop, run & in my gardens. It works wonderfully."
2,It's OK for $10 - $12 no more!,"The thinner tube on this is kind of big and when you pump it, a lot comes out. I would like to see someone make one that really just sort of mists the powder. This kind of blows it out in a larger volume than you need. You can waste a lot of product with it. Also, sometimes with vigorous pumping, the back of the large tube pops off. It goes back, but it can be a hassle. It's OK, but kind of cheaply made for the price. I would pay maybe 10 bucks for it, but I paid too much for something that is not worth it by quality and doesn't work as one of these should be made to work."
2,difficult to get even spray,I am sure with enough time one could develop the appropriate touch to get an even spray with this product. I simply do not wish to take that time and will use other products.
4,Handy Duster,Easy to use hand operated duster. Small and compact unit allows application of dust in small and limited acces spaces.
3,Its okay,"It does tend to clog up when using, one reviewer mentioned to tip it upside down to make it work better. It does help when you do that."
3,adaquate to good,"Distributes the dust a little uneven, but worth it. Good product,good price... I reccomend it... RT"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY,Tryed to spray sevin dust bottom blew off twice in 5 min. of use trashed it within 15 mins. of receiving unit. JUNK
3,Nice.,"These are nice and very pretty, however, the hanger part tends to separate from the rest of the hanger."
5,Beautiful and Depraved,"Along with Josh Bell, this is one of the few poets that can take the natural depravity of human beings and spin it so many ways; it can be funny, sad, loathing, contempuous, bitter, bitter-sweet, etc., but it never goes unearned and each poem seems to stem from some form of loss or injustice. Any poet that can take the darkest side of human nature and ""tell it slant,"" as they say, to make you laugh or sit in a sublime kind of shock is worth reading... so few poets can make ""silk out of a sow's ear."""
3,does not fit 20D as advertised,3 stars since this part should not have to exist! easy to bump off while carrying your camera which is waht happened to mine...
5,One of the best western films ever.,"This is about as close as you can get to the perfect western, great cast from top to bottom and the scenery and filming are top notch. I don't think Lee Marvin ever gave a stronger, more nuanced performance in his career and for once Jack Palance seemed like a real person. It has humor, action, love, sadness and a real story to tell. It is set in the last days of cowboys and the small ranchers, everything is changing and it really catches some of the characters unprepared. I can recommend this to any film buff whether you like western or not its just great to watch."
1,Watch out for DVD version with only 99 minute run time!,"This is a great movie, and my review is simply to warn others that the DVD is only 99 minutes long, while the full movie is 106 minutes. Why they cut scenes from movies for DVD release, I don't understand, but most of us who like movies, like the full run time edition. They did the same thing to Blood Simple."
3,Second Rate VHS,"The tape I received was a disappointment. The movie, Monte Walsh was shot in Panivision and I assumed would be done so on the tape. Not true. The tape is blurry and the sound seems to have been restained. I taped this movie sometime ago from TV and after viewing the ""New Tape"" found the tape I recorded much better. In the introduction for instance I can read Momma Cass in full. On the new tape one of the s's is left off. The technical info from Amazon or Inetvideo is non-existent. What gives?"
2,"May be kind to environment, but tough on your nose","I am interested in recycled paper products, so bought a bunch (30 boxes) of these tissues. There are only 100 in a box, so there are all those boxes to discard. Plus, I use them in my office (sometimes people cry/sniffle/sneeze) and found that the tissues are scratchy and rather thin. If Seventh Generation can cut down on excessive packaging (more tissues per box?) and solve the scratchy, cheap toilet paper feel, I will reconsider. Right now, I am not planning to reorder this product."
2,Nice tissues,"Uncomfortable, but nice to help the environment, until these tissues went over $0.30 cents a box that is!"
4,Kenny Does it Again,"Another extraordinary CD from Kenny White. Great musicianship, amazing lyrics. ""Sooner or later you'll stop shooting yourself/And shoot the moon instead . . . "" ""You're already gone/You might as well leave . . . "" Try this, you will like it."
5,Excellent for beginners!,"This is a great book for beginners, and the audio tape is more helpful than I had anticipated! I am homeschooling and do not speak Spanish, but my 10 year old wanted to learn. She is already putting sentences together from this book, and audio tape alone!!"
1,Be warned this is not a lessons dvd.,I bought this believing it was a dvd lesson video that would come with a tab booklet like they usually do. Low and behold I find out this didn't after receiving it. I investigated into why not and found out this isn't considered a lesson dvd. This is a video of him basically playing and talking about his technique and whatnot. Apparently dvd's put out under the Vestapol label of Stefan Grossmans label are not instructional videos. Nowhere did it states this when I bought this. So I say don't waste your money like I did. You can find enough stuff of him on youtube and basically learn the same thing in this video. I gave it one star because that was the lowest they have.
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be one of the worst in the Teach Yourself series. Some of the problems are common to other new titles in this series, while others are unique to this book. The coverage of grammar is extremely weak. Many of the exercises are not challenging at all--matching elements in two columns, circling words, rearranging sentences--and do little to increase command of the language or reinforce material learned. Other exercises require vocabulary that was never introduced and is not even in the glossary. There is far too much English on the CDs, and astonishingly, English words are used as examples for Greek pronunciation. Often there is no time allotted on the recording to repeat the Greek phrases. The author and editors seem to lack a basic grasp of elementary principles of language pedagogy."
3,"Oops, conversation based...","Don't get me wrong, there's nothing really ""bad"" about this Teach Yourself Greek book and CD set - it's just that it kind of throws you in at the deep end. It starts with the alphabet and a basic pronunciation guide, then it goes right into ""How are you?"" and ""What's your name?"" etc, which is fine for someone who knows the verb ""to be"" in Greek already. I am a total beginner, so I really need something that starts at the VERY beginning. I mean, I can memorize the various phrases fairly easily, but it isn't of any real use unless I actually understand the nuts and bolts of the language. To use a cooking analogy, this is like learning to scramble eggs without knowing how to break them first.However, for someone with an intermediate grasp of the immediate basics of the language, I would still recommend it. Like I said, there's really nothing bad about it - it's just not as ""for beginners"" as you might think."
5,Review of Teach Yourself Greek Book and CD,"This is excellent. I have purchased other greek language CDs in the past. And this one is better than the others that I have purchased. However, what I am most impressed with, is the book. In the first 15 pages, I was, for the first time, clear about many things about the language. Together, this book and CD are giving me confidence in further learning modern Greek."
4,Fun and Challenging,"This course is a lot of fun, but it is also very challenging. It immediately immerses you into the language. It requires dedication to learn any language and this one certainly is no exception, but I would reccommend this book to anyone wanting to learn Greek"
1,not worth it,"I'm a new student to Greek, my boyfriend is from Athens and is teaching me. I got this book to help me with grammar and vocabulary, but it's turning out to be a terrible book. The dialogues in the book make no sense at all. Everyone in the book is from somewhere other than Greece, so you are constantly learning how to say things like ""I am from Paris. Do you speak Italian?"". It just makes no sense. The layout of the book is also not very good. I've done other self-taught language courses and this is by the far the worst I've ever used. I'm now searching for a new book to replace this one. Don't buy it!"
1,Too much Greek,"I was looking for something that would help me with Greek for an upcoming 6 day visit. You know, just the basics, hello, goodbye, bathroom, etc..This product is way too detailed for what I'm looking for."
2,not what i ordered,I received this item quickly but much to my dismay there is no svideo on it! Only the red white and yellow cables. now i cant use it without switching out stuff each time i want to use something else. i have a free s video spot open on my plasma tv so i thought this would be perfect. what a jip.
2,not the greatest,The cable works which is the most important aspect. Aside of that the cable is cheaply made and barely fit into the back of my dreamcast. It looks and feels like it was made in the back of someone's truck. I would recommend looking elsewhere for a sturdier cable. I'm sure that I will have to purchase another cable in the near future.
2,BE WARNED: S-Video does NOT work.....,The product is not what advertised. I bought this for the S-Video for my dreamcast but it DID NOT work!! Only the AV connector worked. It was cheap so it's not worth my hassle for me to return it. I gave this seller a neutral review and now he's begging to reverse the review. That's not going to happen. That's what you get for selling a cheap low grade product.
1,Didn't work,I bought this hoping to play my Dreamcast without using the rf connector it came with. Well the cable didn't even work.
5,interAct Stereo A/V Cable,"The service was excellent and the shipping was the fastest I've ever seen, but due to my error, it was not the cable that I needed. Thankfully, the company sent me the right one and everything works beautifully now. I'd recommend this company to evryone who needs the classic game cables."
2,a/v works not s-video,"I tried two of these cables on two different tv's with two different dreamcast systems. The s-video never worked but the a/v was fine. My original a/v cables are fine, so what I was looking for was an s-video cable. Therefore, I was very unhappy with this product and the fact that when the s-video was plugged in I only got a fuzzy black and white picture. If you are only looking for a/v cables this product is fine. If you are wanting s-video, like I was, this is not for you."
1,broken!,"This was supposed to be a new cable but it never worked, tried several different tv's and adapters, and it was nonfunctional."
4,Awesome! THANK YOU!!!,"The product had shipped and arrived in the mail rather quickly, so I would first like to say thank you! THANK YOU! 8)Not sure as to why I am being requested to rate ""This game"" as it says, but I suppose that could be an Amazon error!? I had bought this product intended for my Dreamcast, and it works GREAT! It was also received with the product appearing to be sealed in it's original box/packaging! ****"
2,Piece of Junk,"I should have listened to the other reviews on here that stated that the S-Video does not work. All you get is a grey scale(black and white) image. I tested it on several TV's, even an old CRT, and I get the same result. The audio and composite video does work fine however but I wanted the higher quality one would get from S-Video. I'll be purchasing the VGA adapter now and I recommend that everyone else who reads this review do the same. Don't waste your money on this defective product."
5,Beautiful!,The tree is absolutely beautiful!! The free shipping though... the box did not withhold being shipped and this was in pieces when I received. I put everything together and everything seems to work fine and I have all the pieces including the bulb checker. Amazing!! Please note: I've been told to use a surge protector when using the tree as this will help the tree last longer in case of any surges you have in your area. THX!
4,On the brink of war,"Following the thrilling ""A Dark and Hungry God Arises"", Angus Thermopyle and his crew aboard Trumpet flee forbidden space with several craft in pursuit and the Amnioni prepared to commit an act of war to recover or destroy Trumpet. While this is happening, the political struggle back home at Earth between Dios and Fasner intensifies.Though the plotting is looser and less intense than in Book 3, this is a satisfying tale of cat and mouse. Except with four cats after one mouse. Trumpet, already carrying people and information of vital importance to both species, raises the stakes even higher by paying a visit to a very capable research installation hidden in an asteroid swarm. The ship combat at the end of the book was laughably unrealistic (only one way in and out of the asteroid swarm despite three dimensions of movement??), but it still made for an exciting climax to the book."
2,A disappointment,"Donaldson can tell a story, but this series was weak. Character development is excellent; but theme clarity is muddy; and there is no climax - in fact - there is no ending, just loose ends fairly disconnected from the developed nature of the characters. My recommendation is to re-read the Thomas Covanent Series."
1,A poor effort,"This book pales in comparison to the first two books of the series, and is about as bad as the third. Gone are the fascinating character developments- in their place you get hack writing, bad science, and literary drudgery. Go ahead and read it if you are a Donaldson devotee, otherwise don't waste your time."
3,Donaldson is a great writer,"I haven't read this particular book, but if it is anything like the other books he has written then I will be sure to like it. I rated it 3 stars only because I haven't read it as yet."
4,A wild ride,"Yet again there is action, counter-action, plot twists, side stories..it's almost dizzying in its MTVish momentary presentation. Maybe that's why it was either widely acclaimed or panned to the skies. For some time, humans have been working on an anti-alien (mutagen) drug that prevents them from converting to something not human.Thantos, that hell of a place, explodes and Nick manages to rescue several people including Nick (downgraded from hero to simple pirate with illusions of grandeur), Morn, Davies, her son who was aged rapidy by the evil aliens, the sadist Angus, etc. We have lovers, family, enemies -the whole gambit, from good and bad and they are all on the same small vessel. One undercurrent is the struggle against the evil mining company that has control of their brain."
4,Practical and refreshing,"Ms. Sinsabaugh does an excellent job reminding us that our faith should never get too complicated that we loose sight of the joy-filled life Christ wants us to live. This book contains refreshing simple concepts that make you say, ""I think I knew that already but....why aren't I doing anything about it!"" How good it is to be reminded that our faith should draw people to Christ and not scare them away. Very practical ideas! I enjoyed it so much I bought copies for friends involved in ministry."
4,Very interesting for an old book...,"This book was published just as the F-14 was coming into service. for being a new, and supposedly ""sensitive"" design, the author has included a large amount of data which I thought would have been considered Top Secret.The book goes into very technical detail about various systems on the (new) F-14A Tomcat. The weapons system and radar, the heart and soul of the F-14, are covered in great depth. In fact, most systems are covered in a good amount of detail.Of interest is the analytical comparisons of the F-14 to other contemporary aircraft. This section alone makes the price worthwhile.The only system which is brushed over is the problems with the finicky and tempermental TF-30 engines which have plagued the F-14 through it's entire career.If you are a Tomcat buff, then this is a MUST HAVE in your library!"
5,A trip back to 1975!,"This book was published in 1975. At the time, the F-14 is brand new, just reaching the fleet and it is without a doubt the most advanced fighter ever created. All of the Tomcat's advantages over its predecessor (the F-4J) and its Soviet adversaries (MiG-23, -21, -19, at the time) are explained in detail including the bubble canopy, weapons system, and untouched maneuverability. All of the aircraft systems are explained in detail with extra emphasis placed on the functioning of the AWG-9 radar. Though the book is very old, it contains information not found in other books. It's a great old book if you can find it!"
2,Labor-Intensive Cooking,"This is the French cooking of another time--outdated, but interesting.The complexities of the recipes would make Child or Pepin shudder !"
4,Great Cookbook,"This is a great cookbook. Julia Child used this cookbook so you know it's good. The recipes are awesome, you can't go wrong."
5,Wonderful Cookbook,"A wonderful book, if you purchase this book you will have no need to purchase another French cookbook. Its circa 1927, so don't expect, microwaves, blenders, or any of the other electrical items we take for granted in the kitchen..this book is hands on. But this is part of the beauty of this book it teaches you to be a good cook, although its really not for the beginner. Much to the horror of the French because I have a lactose intolerance, and many of the recipes involve milk I have had to use lactose free milk...and you know the recipes have still come out as beautiful tasting as Madame E. Saint-Ange would have expected. Im sure low fat milks or creams won't be a problem if your watching your weight (we have to make some allowances in todays world)..they did'nt have nutrtionists running around telling people what they should and should'nt eat back in 1927. The book is wonderful just to read in itself..turn to any page and you will Im sure learn something new."
5,Good Times,I love this cookbook. I love it in a puffy heart kind of way.It is one of the few that stays on my counter as a reference guide as well as a casual read.I've mainly used it as a reference for techniques but have made several recipes from it. And have found them to be complex but well worth the time it takes to make them.
4,Great product that used to be for a great price,"I have had different types of digestion issues since a child. Recently I was introduced to the idea of probiotics. I chose this brand specifically because of all the great reviews. I have been using this product for about a month and have noticed great improvements. Lets put it this way, my new nickname should be smooth operator! I give this only 4 stars not because of the quality but for the price. A month ago it was $20 a bottle now its almost $85! Really how is that even possible?! Now I'm forced to look for another brand that is just as good for a more reasonable price...."
5,Good Stuff,"My doctor had recommended eating sauerkraut to improve my digestion. So for the past year I have been eating a lot of sauerkraut and that helped my digestion and eliminated pimples on my back. However, whenever I was traveling or did not eat it pimples came back.I read about the benefits of probiotics and was looking for a good one when I came across Accuflora on Amazon. I read the reviews and decided to try it.Based on the reviews I decided to test Accuflora and see if it can eliminate the pimples on my back. After just two weeks of taking one with breakfast and one with dinner the pimples disappeared and my skin feels really good. My digestion is good too as well as my bowel movement. According to the Amazon reviews and the manufacturer it can also improve the immune system if you take two caplets in the morning on an empty stomach.I give it a big thumbs up!"
3,Pro-biotic suggest by my doctor,"Pro-biotic was suggested by my doctor. AccuFlora is about a third as expensive as the acidophilus offered at my clinic's pharmacy, but takes two pills instead of one. I think I feel better and more balanced."
2,Good for Yeast Infections but did nothing for stomach problems,"Bought this over 3 weeks ago based on the comments, and the fact that having a yogurt every day is way more expensive. I have IBS (C) and suffer from constant gas and bloating. Unfortunately I haven't noted any improvement in my condition whatsoever. However, my twin sister had a yeast infection and decided to take a few capsules...she was very impressed that it helped. I've subsequently ordered the Accuflora-controlled probiotic acidophilus, which based on the comments is more suited for IBS sufferers. I clearly ordered the incorrect ones, but will continue to take these, at least until the new set arrive, and because probiotics are good for you, especially if you've taken a regiment of medication as I have over the years."
3,Only 500 million live bacteria at time of manufacture,"That has me concerned somewhat as what I had been taking, Now Gr8-Dophilus shows 4 billion.This suggests that Accuflora is only 1/8 as strong.Anyone else taking please compare it to specific other pro-biotics.This one is cheap when buying in bulk. It just appears to be weaker than many others from a quick glance at the package.Picked up a small 30 count box onsale at Walgreens for $3.99+ tax yesterday.Comments ?"
2,Not this time,"It was fine when I took it last time. But for this new shipment, I noticed some sort of uncomfortable signs (like stomach upset, heart burn) right after taking them. Not sure what's wrong ..."
5,Worked better for me than others ...,"I tried this product along withOrtho Molecular Product Orthos Biotic -- 60 Capsulesduring two separate bouts of having to take anti-biotics in the past year - one for strep and one a very strong anti-biotic they gave me for possible lyme tick bite (I would not take that anti-biotic again!). I am 39 and in great health generally.This product set better in my stomach as well as my bowel both times and got me ""back to normal"" quicker than Ortho Biotic did. As with the Ortho Biotic, the accuflora also does not require refrigeration.I think people's bodies/genetics are all different as well as our environments, diets, illnesses and prescription medications, so all I can relay is my personal experience - your mileage may vary :)"
3,2 pills per serving; wish they came as softgels,"Probiotic Supplements, Accuflora / B000LJCOWWI started taking these after Prevention magazine reported that overweight adults who took a probiotic supplement lost an average of 2 pounds over 12 weeks, compared with those on a placebo, in a Canadian research. I also noticed that this was highly touted as helping with digestion, which is always a good thing in my book.I don't know how I feel about these pills, though. I wish they came in a softgel form - the pills are chalky and rough, and they smell and taste pretty bad. They are, at least, medium sized, so they aren't too tough to swallow, but they're definitely my least favorite of the morning pill routine. Also note that a ""serving size"" is actually two pills, not one.-----240 pills per bottle2 pill per serving(120 servings per bottle)70 mg sodium150 mg probiotic blend~ Ana Mardoll"
5,The Best of the Best!,"I take a medication that seems to keep my yeast levels high, so I am constantly battling thrush mouth which is disgusting. I hate to even talk about it but if it helps someone else, I guess it will be worth it. Naturally, I have tried many different brands of probiotics and I have found this one to work the best. I take two pills a day and have been practically symptom free since starting to use this product. The only time I've had any symptoms at all was during Christmas when I ate way too much sugar! Luckily, this product went right to work and I was symptom free again in no time."
5,Great Probiotic,Have been using this probiotic for over a year. Tried others many pricier and less effective.
4,Good entry level product - but there are better available now,I had no problem with these. They were cheap for 240 capsules. By the time you get to the end of the bottle there is a good amount of pill dust remaining though.Going forward I plan to try these instead:[...]As they are reported to deliver a greater quantity of living flora to the gut.
1,Lost my trust and business,"In February 2012 I paid $22.99 for a bottle of 240 caplets right here. When I came back to reorder the price had jumped to $109.99 an increase of $87.00! I'm sorry, but this is wrong on so many levels. How can I trust a company that pulls this? Will it go up another $87.00 in less than 6 months? Who knows, hey, anything goes here? This product makes me sick if it can jump that much in less than 6 months. I never said anything bad about previous orders when bottles would arrive with caplets broken up inside, but at this price? I'll just find another product."
4,These are really great for health..,These are really great for health. Package arrived on time in good condition. These are good replacement for yogurt.
4,Nice...,I felt what it means when some one has absolutely nothing!!!By the way I wanted to punch the lazy husband! What kind of man walks around ordering others what to do and not to do and see his children suffer and see all kinds of jobs beyond his EGO!
2,Disapointed,"I am from the Northeast of Brazil and I expected a better movie. The accent of the actor sounded fake. The are from the southeast of Brazil and did not work well on the accent. The movie as a caricatura.Next time I will stick with ""Auto da Compadecida"". Much better."
4,Very thoughtful and professionally made movie,"From the very first minutes of this movie you clearly understand how professionally it was made. Perfect photography and director's work! I tend to think that this is due to the producer Bruno Barreto.There's a simple story with a few turns. You'll find a lot of Brazilian country landscapes here and meet local culture.After viewing this film I felt a little sad because such a large and beautiful country with such good people and rich culture is so poor. This movie won't thrill you, but it will make you think and feel instead."
4,the middle of the world,"from what I understand this wonderful little movie is based on a true story told by a family who makes us realize how important love in the family unit is, even with the normal odd disagreements which is only human. It gives you strength to endure, courage and hope. Loved Roberto Carlos music."
4,arid norttheast landscapes thro a bittersweet lens,"Apart from being a good road film (landscapes, transience etc), the lead actors have nicely portrayed the machismo that rules most latin american and asian societies. good soundtrack, imagery, and having been in brasil recently, i was taken back there, to the endless horizons, red roads and dusty bus stations.i'd buy it if i could afford the steep price."
2,Still waiting....,"From the reviews and the storyline on the DVD cover, I was very excited to see this film. Unfortunately, this story was drawn out and had no real direction. The characters were boring, and nothing terribly eventful happened along the way. It was as if a camera filmed a stubborn father's trip on a bike and documented nothing of interest.To cheer yourself back up, watch a good film like 'The Man Who Copied' - also Brazilian and way more interesting."
4,Garmin GXM 30 antenna,"Purchased this antenna to install on zumo 550 GPS. Transfered subscription from sporster 5 to garmin. Much better XM satelite reception. I used ball mount and put next to GPS on Goldwing 1800 bike. Rather large, would have prefered somethng smaller."
2,Not reliable,"This product combines both XM and XM Nav service. When connected to a supported radio, XM works with the XM Nav options, limiting some of the XM channel information. Additionally Radio enters standby mode for no apparent reason.Picking up the XM Sat info takes anywhere from 15 to 45 seconds"
1,No Bluetooth Headset FXN,"This thing is crap! The only reason to spend all this money on the Zumo is for the hands free bluetooth features in your helmet, otherwise there are lots of cheaper products to use. The XM radio is restricted from playing music on your bluetooth headset, which renders this thing less than useful. Garmin doesn't bother to tell you this in the product info either. CRAP!!!!"
5,The irreversible disgrace!,"This work is an impressive and crude testimonial that would seem to have been extracted from a Police chronicle. An awful and traumatic fact in the early years of an anonymous, unknown and humble child will determine an anomalous, bitter and comprehensible but not justifiable sickness behavior. Hate and rage; deception and spiritual penury join to that hopeless environment, where the violence is the main ingredient to survive will spark all your interest once you start to read it."
2,total rip-off,"So basically, this album has _nothing_ to do with Middle-earth or the Shire or anything remotely recognizable as Tolkienian. It's a series of fairly generic Christmas carols done, basically, in the style of ""easy listening."" I suppose it's decent easy listening music, if you like that kind of thing, but personally I found it unoriginal, repetitive, and completely boring."
3,average,"A little more flimsey than I am used to from my Thinkpad keyboard. Also, the useless windows keys mess up the layout that I am used to with my IBM laptops.The key responsiveness is fast, but doesn't feel as crisp as I would like."
5,Stealth build,"I just picked up this keyboard today. Its pretty and stylish and its 2x quieter then a normal keyboard. The so called ""active response"" makes it feel nicer when the keys are touched."
3,SWANSON & DOUGLAS.,"Nella Vago is a young opera singer who is making her first major appearance at a Venetian opera house. The critics are less than enchanted, and her teacher remarks that she lacks the passion & fire which makes the difference between a singer and a diva. Gloria's voice takes on a newly-found timbre after an amourous affair with a handsome ""gigolo"" played by Fredric March...A fairly entertaining early talkie which was originally a stage play starring Melvyn Douglas and his wife, Helen Gahagan. The play was the last to be produced by Broadway legend David Belasco before his death. Note that Boris Karloff has a slyly engaging comedy part in this antique curio which continued to keep Swanson's fading career in the talkies on the down-side."
2,The matte finish is a sticker.,"The base is like melamine board/particle board, which is the color of cardboard from the back. I was not impressed. The sticker looked nice except where it peeled at the top & bottom. I gave it as a gift & was embarassed. A definite ""never again"". Boo"
3,Pretty good...,"If you don't have high expectations this is a good DVD to buy. Since this is only the beginning of the series the story doesn't really hit the runway til the third episode, and it doesn't take off until the fifth episode. The music leaves something to be desired, but the action is good. Though I'm hoping it improves with the next volume, I am not at all disapointed in this DVD."
3,Truly average,"A lot of die hard fans gave this volume 5 stars. I believe that is fandom clouding their judgement. The music is absolutely horrible. I felt like I was watching an animated series for little girls, which plays poorly against the violent theme and adult language.The story in this volume is not very exciting either. They do a great job demonstrating the bond between Ryu and Ken. That is probably the best thing about the series at this point. The only characters introduced are Guile, Chun Li, and Fei Long. The fighting is bland, the animation is made-for-TV anime. The only reason I give this 3 stars is that fandom is clouding my better judgement and this is just the beginning of the series."
2,"Boring, and has little relationship to the game","I never watched the entire run of the show, because the first few episodes; the ones represented on this DVD, were phenomenally boring.Probably the biggest reason for this is that the game bears very little resemblance to the game at all. The characters have all been reimagined, and not in a good way. A lot of the distinctiveness and personality of the original characters was lost in this translation. In fact, the entire show feels very little like the game, which begs the question: why bother getting the license to do it as Street Fighter if you're not going to stay true to the Street Fighter feel and characters?"
3,street figter II V series,I personaly have not seen it but everyone that i have herd from who have seen it say it is the best SF movie my rating says that i gave it a 3 but i cant really rate it becouse i myself have not actually seen itPDN LEGS
4,Giant Cartoon Squirrels shred you into liquid.,"Dave Witte [Burnt by the Sun, Municiple Waste] and Chris Dodge [Spazz] created what may be the greatest novelty grind project to date. Very much akin to acts like Discordance Axis, Mr. Bungle, Fantomas, and early Nasum, East West Blast Test delivers the grinding goods as well as pushing the envelopes of intensity and musical absurdity. To put it simply, this disc is the audio equavilent to having your face shoved into a wood chipper by giant cartoon squirrels."
1,Not even for free....,"One of the worst experiences I've had with a product. I've had the damn thing for over a year and only made the mouse and keyboard work. Belkin support is unfamiliar with the product and have only suggested uninstall and reinstall as a solution. Vista itself is no box of chocolates, but this is just plain awful."
1,Worthless,After 6 hours trying to get this thing to work with my new Dell computer I give up.Belkin support is no help. They suggest things that don't work.
1,"Great concept, fails to deliver miserably!","WHY, OH WHY didn't I take the advice of the other reviewers here. I had high hopes that Belkin has smoothed out the issues with this dock, but alas, I am miserably disappointed. Hooked it up to my new Sony Vaio notebook, followed the directions to a tee and within 5 minutes of installing, this lovely thing gave me the blue screen of death. After searching the internet for a fix and 3 install/uninstalls later, the thing is back in the box on it's way back to Amazon.If I could rate this ZERO STARS I would. I'm appalled Amazon still sells a project that flat out, doesn't work! I'm so disappointed and will search for other option. <sigh> Thanks alot Belkin."
1,Belkin bombs,"Caused blue screen of death on new Toshiba satellite laptop. Two hour's help from Belkin's telephone support failed to fix the problem. I returned it and bought the Toshiba docking station instead, which is what I should have bought in the first place."
1,Piece of Junk!,"This was the biggest peice of junk ever! I am now swearing off Belkin.Pros: Looks cool.Cons: Incompatible with just about every Vista laptop (tried to install it on 3). Very difficult to install. Support from Belkin is ridiculous. I'm a programmer & Tech, so I finally got it installed on one of my laptops, the video card never worked.Conclusion: Don't buy this. Research it on the Web 1st. When I purchased it, very few had reviewed it on the Web after purchase, only the main stream media reviewed it and they are too political. Now you will find many bad reviews of this device."
1,resist the temptation,"I hate this thing. It's not worth it. As much as a hassle it is to plug everything into my laptop, in the long run, it would be much faster than constantly restarting and getting the dock to play nice.Follow the instructions carefully and some things work flawlessly like my mouse and keyboard. MY CRT monitor works but the dock's software has changed the resolution of my laptop's widescreen monitor so all my icons are stretched and I need to manually change it everytime I turn on my pc. Oh, and if you put your laptop to hibernate or standby, forget about it. You need to restart.Other gripes:- my dvd-rom and memory stick don't work on this dock.- I have to plug speakers into the dock as it made the speakers on my laptop non-functional.- My built-in webcam doesn't work either.The only good thing is that if I don't use the dock, my laptop's sound and video cards return to original configuration. However, my display settings still don't recognize it's a widescreen."
1,No drivers for Windows 7,"purchased a brand new unit and now I realize that it only works on windows XP!!!!!! Come on guys, you list this as a currently available product on your website and don't have drivers for Windows 7.Belkin should really send money back to all customers"
1,"yeah, what he / she said","Tried this with my new Asus laptop which has no dock made for it. I needed an adapter for the connection slot because the laptop only came with PCIMA slots. The dock never worked with Vista or XP, and Belkin told me that the dock station was not tested for use with PCIMA adapters, making it useless for anyone with an older laptop I'm afraid. I'm glad to see that others had problems with it too. I took a hit money-wise on this purchase, and will not buy Belkin products again."
1,Far more cumbersome than just using a USB hub,"This item defeats the purpose of have a convenient docking station. It's cumbersome to use, takes up a lot of desk space, routes all of your cables and wires to the top of your desk so they're right in your way. it is not a ""plug and play"" interface; you have to reboot after you've disconnected it and want to reconnect.Also, at the time I make my purchase, it was very expensive.THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF THIS ITEM OUTWEIGH ANY OF THE REASONS YOU WOULD BUY A DOCKING STATION IN THE FIRST PLACE.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM."
4,Marvelous Compilation Marred only by Weak Bass,"I judge, overall, that this single-channel monaural CD transfer has not been seriously falsified in relation to most of the original 78 rpm shellac pressings I have personally audited and transferred to tape; I do suspect that in a few cases, some additional, very low amplitude, digitized ambience has been added in a noncontroversial manner.There is, however, a loss of bass response compared to the first shellac and vinyl issues, and sometimes a rather tiresome upper midrange peak. Listeners with a simple graphic equalizer may, in a few short moments of adjustment, restore proper balances and completely enjoy the recording."
2,Boring / Repetitive,"Thirteen of the 16 tracks on this CD begin with the word ""Heritage"". Evidently, they are derived from music written for a PBS series. The problem is: Duffy uses the same motif in almost every segment ... and it gets boring very quickly. In fact, the first two tracks on this CD use this motif repeatedly."
3,First Disc Is All Scratched Up!,When I got this season today the first disc of part two was loose and it was scratched up. It looks like it would play but I will check in the morning. The good thing is that I didn't have to pay for shipping and it only cost me $2.00 above regular retail price of one part to get both parts of the season on Amazon. It's a great savings. Not only that the post office got my shipment to me in less time then what the estimated time was.
3,ok,"It just seems like every show of theres is almost the excat same. Jason and grant say the same things over and over, and they spend more time reviewing evidance that looking for it. Go with a diffrent show."
2,"You seen one, you've seen 'em all.","I give this show credit for starting a cable TV craze on the paranormal. Nearly every channel I turn to has the ubiquitous jerky night-vision camera shots of dazed looking faces with glowing irises as they listen to old houses creak and groan, they lead to a big build-up someone screams, cut to commercial and when you return from your trip to the bathroom or refrigerator you find out they had been startled by a mouse or a bug or their own flatulence, whatever... If there is anything to claims of the paranormal Ghost Hunters do very little to promote real study in the field. The show fails even in the rhelm of entertainment as most episodes are so predictable and so dull that its a wonder if I can stay awake through one. Even the stars of the show and the founders of TAPS, Jason and Grant, look bored out of their minds. So watch if you must but you might have more fun if you pop in your old DVD of ""Ghostbusters."""
1,Fakes,They been caught as fakes but hey they will keep doing it as long as they keep getting truck loads of cash. I would be cool with the show if they didnt keep saying 100% real. Like the other shows I will watch cause you know its mostly crap but fun to watch. These guys keep saying that its real. Youtube some ghost hunters taps fake clips and learn
1,Terminal boredom.....,"Why spend 40 minutes watching paint dry orwatching a kettle boil (dry) orwatching grass grow orwatching the hair on your nose curl orwatching your toe nails get longer orwatching re-runs of ""I love Lucy"" orwatching your washing drying orwatching your goldfish orwatching your cat or dog clean its bum orwatching fox news orwatching poker on espn?When you could be watching an episode ofGhost Hunters instead!It has everything but the ghost.Me? I'd rather floss my cat's teeth."
5,Fantastic,"As all their shows are this one has not let me down, it's as good as the rest of the seasons have been. I love this show and I think it is one of the best there is on syfy. You guys rock and I will continue to watch and buy your seasons."
2,good show bad packaging,I recieved this with season 7 part 1. The box from amazon was poorly handled not even a piece of tape to keep closed. The DVD box was made for four disks and leads me to think it was pirated. It was also cracked and the disks although playable were scratched. The season 7 DVD box was a joke. Thin as a single disk box all four disks piled on top of each other. Also making me think was a fake copy. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the disks although scratched were playable and the show is great. As far as shipping I am very disapointed. I have ordered many things from amazon and have never recieved such poor packaging from either amazon or a product.
1,Got the wrong item,I ordered Santa Claus is Coming to town - a book by Steven Kellogg and I received some sheet music by who knows who. I am very disappointed to say the least.
3,A bit pricey for what it is,"This rubber frame fits around the various diopteric adjustments for the viewfinder of the Digital Rebel / Digital Rebel XT cameras.Do note that it is NOT the ""Eyecup EF""; it is the rubber frame from that eyecup, but without the plastic bit that attaches to the camera's viewfinder. That's a separate item entirely that costs about the same, but this one is intended for use with the diopteric adjustment pieces."
3,Not What You Think It Is,"You would think that this would be the thing to buy if the little rubber gasket had fallen off of your Digital Rebel XL.You would be wrong.In fact, I have absolutely no idea what this thing is. There's no way to interface this with the plastic frame that remains around my viewfinder. I ended up ripping the gasket off of this frame and affixing it to my Rebel. I'm left with a little chunk of plastic that I'm tossing in my camera bag, though I can't imagine what I'll ever do with it. But I just paid $10 for this thing, so I can't very well throw it away, or so goes the thinking.If there's a source of rubber gaskets, go with that. If you don't mind tearing this up to get a gasket, then get this. Otherwise, this is not for you."
5,Rubber frame for eye cup,This little piece of rubber is just what I wanted since my other one fell off and was lost! Thank you!!!
2,Ridiculous,"This is a ridiculous price for what it is. Even worse, I realized only after I got it that it's the frame to be used around dioptric lenses. It's not what you would get to replace the rubber piece around the stock eye cup. So, like an earlier reviewer, I had to pull off the gasket and put it onto my eyecup. Luckily it fits so it wasn't a complete waste and the end result was what I wanted."
3,Not Sure What To Do WIth This,I think I'm supposed to place it somewhere on the camera. Order was smoothe and arrived quickly. Now to figure out how to use it...
3,Brother Label,"I have learned that not all people sell the crack and peel type labels, so be careful to ask questions. The labels are hard to peel once printed."
5,Half-inch size is great for 2-line labels...,"I don't recall why we ordered via amazon, but we did this time. Basic order, nothing fancy. We own a Brother P-touch label maker and like to have one 1/2-inch black on clear tape (for 2-line label needs) and one 1/4-inch black on clear tape and one black on white tape (either size) on hand at all times. My wife and daughter use the label maker far more than I do."
3,good but sloppy handling.,"I bought the brother tape titler machine - very good. It is easier than Avery Labels, I ordered the tape brother TZ131, I thought it was black on white like the sample roll, it is black on clear. I didn't open it. I would really like to just swap the tape for black on white, but it is a problem dealing with internet exchange purchases, It seems such a hassle. I just put it one side. It sour one."
4,Good but not as useful as Black on white,Black on white is the best. It is easier to read than white on black (the letters don't come out as crisp esp when using small font sizes) and black on clear. Black on Clear requires that the background is light or clear. I used to label an old Power Mac G4 Cube computer and it looked great. Other times I tried it on something that was dark and it was hard to read.The special backgrounds can add a more professional look that the universal all purpose white on black. Brother labels are expensive but well worth the benefit which is a more organized home or work life. I have two brother printers: a portable and a desktop which is connected to my computer by USB model PT-1950. You get free software from brother's website and you can save your labels.
2,Sorry Marvel VS Capcom players...,"All six topside buttons (ABC XYZ) are indeed programmable. Virtually any combination of cross-pad presses and ABXY can be programmed into these six buttons without a lot of hassle.But be warned-- the six buttons are smaller and closer together than the four on the standard Dreamcast controller, and are not color-coded.In addition, the LR triggers cannot be programmed nor can LR trigger presses be programmed into a button! 6-button Street Fighter-type game players will still have to reach for those triggers if they need to use all six punches and kicks (though C and Z -can- be programmed to hit two of ABXY together, which can be useful)."
2,It could be better,"This controller could have been better, the control on it is flimsy and it is actually better to use the normal Dreamcast pad. Now if only they could replicate the awesome 1st generation Saturn pad for Dreamcast......."
1,Horrible!,"My niece's future husband has taken three of these back because they continue to fall apart. He eventually decided to stick with the Sega brand. I played with one before it broke (on the second day he had it) and it was pretty good when used playing Soul Calibur, but on other games it seemed a little awkward. I would advise you to go with the Sega controller. Better quality and a better feel."
1,Limitations make it useless,"Since you can't program the top buttons to act like the trigger buttons, you can't achieve the true 6-button layout, and that destroys the purpose of having a controller like this. I'm returning mine tomorrow."
1,This controller is awful.,"This controller is one of the worst feeling, worst handling, and all around horribly designed controllers on the market. The analog stick is shoddy and thin, and the trigger buttons are hard to push in. If you are looking for a six button controller for fighting games I would recommend Mad Catz's Dream Pad."
2,Pretty Crumby,"I bought this, assuming that the z and c buttons could be programmed to work as the L and R buttons. I guess I should've thoroughly checked the customer reviews! I think the company didn't think the design through very well or just wanted to save money. It COULD HAVE been a good controller, if it was a true six-button lay-out! Those extra two buttons are pretty much useless. Try a different controller instead, unless you're really cheap and don't want it for SFIII or Alpha (and the like)."
2,Quantum Fighter Pad,"Someone gave this to me, as an extra controller to use for my Dreamcast, so I wasnt using it for fighting games etc. I was using it for normal games. So for that, it wasnt good at all. Didnt like the feel of it really, and the buttons were that great. Not really recommended."
2,Not a good book.,It is good book for someone want learn the basics of JMF. But it doesn't cover some important topic like broadcasting and conferencing. This cover only javax.media. Not good for advanced users.
2,What is EJMF?,"If you want to learn how to develop applications using JMF don't but this book! If you want to learn how to use EJMF then buy this book. What is EJMF I hear you ask. EJMF is the Essential JMF Toolkit, which most of the examples in this book are based on. Most of what I wanted to learn about JMF is hidden away in EJMF and not explained very well. What a waste of money. Perhaps the authors should bring out another book, EJMF Explained."
2,"Good, but overloaded with typical computer guidebook filler","This book has a fair amount of information and tips, but has way too much filler. It's loaded with cutesy little jokes and redundant information, that only serve to impede your getting at the good stuff. Giving the authors the benefit of the doubt, the wasted paper was probably induced by the publisher to get a more displayable spine on the bookshelf. The code example walk-throughs are very helpful though. But there's not enough description for how to set up all the necessary pieces to make the examples work, at least for windows."
1,Inaudible dialogue,"I don't know if our DVD is a dud or what, but for at least 50% of the movie, the dialogue is inaudible because of a poor sound mix.The music and sound effects are very loud in these spots, but the dialogue is merely detectable. You can see the characters mouths moving, but can't tell what they are saying."
1,"Awful, just awful","sounds like it was made in a garage studio, just like their ""cool ka lang"" song.Do not waste your money on this unless you like unprofessional, garage like quality with equally garage like singing."
2,ok,I have used better litter for the price. I find that it doesn't dry very well when wet and that's a pain.
3,I don't get it.,"This stuff barely does anything for odor.. not sure what the other reviewers are talking about. But it clumps pretty well and it's cheap, so I've been mixing some in with Tidy Cats and that helps a bit. If you're going to get this litter, I suggest getting some litter deodorizer if you don't want your house to smell like the litter box.It's pretty much completely dust free, as advertised. That's pretty nice but not worth the tradeoff in my case."
3,Good litter but not for mechanical litter boxes,"First I must say that this product seems to be a bit better than the average kitty litter. I did not notice much dust and it kept the waste smells to a minimum. It clumped well and did not stick to the bottom of the litter box too much. My cat did not have difficulty adapting to this litter either.My only issue with this litter (and the reason I gave it only three stars) is that my LitterMaid mechanical litter box could NOT scoop away the waste. Therefore, I needed to manually scoop the litter each day - defeating the purpose of a mechanical litter box in the first place."
4,Vesta Approved,"My cat and I both love this litter. We haven't had a single accident with it, even if I forget to scoop the clumps for a few days in a row. She really seems to like digging around in it, and it doesn't track nearly as much as more mainstream litters. I feel confident that it's a safe product for my Vesta."
3,"Not a bad product, just not as good as I'd hoped.","This stuff does clump hard, I'll give it that. But the end result is that it clings to the litter box like a spurned lover. Dust control is good, but to be honest, it's about the same as most of the high-end clays I've tried. Odor control is average, which means that if you get the solids out of the box in a reasonable amount of time, you don't need a gas mask to go about your business. Tracking? About the same as any other. In short, it's as good as most other high-end clay litters, but not nearly as good as I'd hoped based on the reviews here.Look, I always take naysayers with a grain of salt, so feel free to do so with my review, and try the litter yourself; it's not like you're buying a car or a dishwasher. But you need to ask yourself if you really need to be spending half again to twice again as much for this stuff as litters that are just as good."
3,Dust-full,"I ordered this b/c of the claims of being dust-free and the reviews stating the same. I'm sad to say, I think it is very dusty, and the room the litter box is in is coated with a gray level of dust. I don't think I'll be buying this again..."
3,Brother pt1800 labeler,"The labeler was old discontinued stock. It was in the box, but so old the batteries were leaking and covered in a white coating...some were dead. It operates OK when I put new batteries in. The seller, MAXXDEALS, was notified and I suggested they provide new batteries to replace the bad...a cheap fix to satisfy a customer and receive a better review/rating on amazon.They said batteries are ""peripherals"", so they did nothing! That was just a waste of time."
5,Beautiful,"Like the rest of the reviews I've read, this show curtain is perfect. There are absolutely no cons about it except I can't seem to find the accessories for the set."
5,This collector edition CD is a premiere release!,"This collector edition CD by the Toronto Starlight Orchestra (www.starlightorchestra.ca) is their premiere release! Buy it today and keep it for a lifetime ...If you are looking for music that continue to be perennial favourites over the years, you will find them here on this album, as in other CD albums by the Philips Westin Orchestra (www.philipswestin.com) and the Wyndham Regency Orchestra (www.wyndhamregency.com).These 3 orchestras are affiliated under the Sheraton Cadwell Group of Music Professionals (www.sheratoncadwell.com) and they have helped to raise over $350,000 for charitable and humanitarian projects to date.If you would like to support good music and a good cause, here is your opportunity!"
5,Definitely one of the most delightful ballroom dance bands!,"Here is one of the most delightful ballroom dance bands in Canada! I attended a show of theirs last year and picked up this cd. Unlike many other cds in my collection, this is one that I continue to enjoy listening to ..."
3,good if you are new to the hobby,"This book provides a lot of information. If you are new to the hobby this is great book to have in the shack. If you have been into ham radio for more than a year most of this information will be old, you should already have this information in other books. The chapters on emergency communications and traffic handling are pretty much a waste, if a major disaster happened the last thing I would be thinking about is radio. It seems like a good portion of the book is the standard league propoganda on how they what activities to occur on the air. After careful consideration this book is not worth $25"
2,Be very aware,"This is simply a packaging of three products from the back-catalogue in a cheap, dull cardboard box. The CDs are not re-remastered; that is, these are the original CD issues from back in the 80s/turn-of-the-decade. That is to say: Butchered original cover art, no liner notes, and thin sound. The music is truly great, but please don't purchase this thinking you're going to receive newly-remastered and -packaged editions."
4,My indoor lens,"I've had this lens for my Rebels for a couple of years now. It was the first lens I bought with my original Rebel. Coming from a background in 35mm SLR's (Back in the day) I thought I needed to start with a prime. Apparently that isn't the case as my 28-135 IS is the lens that has become 'glued' to my camera(s).This lens, however, is my goto lens for indoor shots without a flash. The fast f/1.8 comes in handy when I don't want to wash out a subject with flash (even with a speedlight).I only give it a 4 out of 5 because I think it is a bit soft for a prime, but I've kept it around while other lenses have gone back to the store or been sold on eBay.I am using it on my Rebel XT now and I suspect I will use it on my next DSLR body (EOS 30D?) whenever that happens.For a fast, wide-angle prime, this is it from Canon..."
4,Good normal lens for APS sensor Canon digital SLRs,"Last summer I sold all my Nikon gear on Eb*y and switched to Canon. This after over a decade of using only Nikon film and then digital SLRs. I bought the 17-40f/4.0L at the same time and consequently found very little use for this lens. I use my digital SLR primarily for travel photography. On my first trip I used this lens less than 5% of the time, preferring the wide zoom even if it was necessary to increase the digital ASA. Still, it's good to have it just in case especialy at this very reasonable price. Construction quality is slightly below that of L lens, with plasticky feel and some wobble in the focus mechanism."
4,Good Prime lens,"I like this lense for group shots in a small area, however when I did some test shots with my UV filter, I had some rainbow spots in my picture. I am unsure of the correct terminology of what that is called but I didn't like it!I removed my UV filter and took some amazing pictures with this lens, however I like to have a filter on it to protect the lens from scratches and dust.This lens is a bit pricey however it does the job well. I love my 50 mm prime lens more than this because of the depth-of-field aspect of it. However right now I can say those two lenses are what I primarily shoot with."
5,a solid lens,"This purchase was a replacement because my previous lens (same exact model) was lost/stolen. It works great on my Canon APS-C sized sensor, with a 44mm equivalent. If I could afford the IS on the newer 28mm lens, I would have bought that. But, considering the price of this lens is half of what it used to be, this lens is now a great value.This fast lens, at f/1.8, beats the standard zoom lens (f/3.5-5.6) in low light any day. Big difference."
4,Great,Awesome lens. Previously owned the 50mm 1.8 and I must say I use this lens more often now. Allows a nice distance for a good shot.
4,Good prime for daily/indoor use,"This is a good prime lens for daily indoor use.Pros:- Fast at f/1.8 although soft- Reasonably sharp from f/2.0, gets better from f/2.2- Rugged- Good 'normal' lens for APS-C sensor with 1.6 multiplier (mine is the 450d)Cons:- Very soft at f/1.8- My copy has a front-focus problem at timesOverall, happy with the lens since I can take available light pictures indoors where my 50mm f/1.4 prime (must have!) is too narrow. I can see the front-focus issue on some shots when compared to my 24-105mm f/4L in a reasonably contolled test. Also, from shot to shot taken indoors, the focus is slightly off at times. On a second test indoors, the focus was spot on."
3,Responce to Nov 23 review,"The reason I bought this lens was to use it indoors in lower light conditions. I have had this lens on my Rebel XT for about six months and it does a fairly a good job. It maybe true that the 50mm 1.4 is better but that type of lens on a 1.6 cropped sensor is only good for portraits in my opinion. It is true this lens is a little on the soft side. You will not have to worry about it long as your not blowing up your image too big. Since there is not much to choose from in 28mm f/1.8 arena for a reasonable price, this was the best choice. Take a look at the picture I posted and judge for yourself. Can you purchase a better lens that will break the bank? Sure! But why would you want too!"
2,Not all that impressed...,"So, I couldn't wait to get this lens. I finally bought it, and was so excited to put it to use. I quickly found that the focus at 1.8 is very soft.In my opinion, the value just isn't there. I mean if your paying double the price of the 28 2.8, you'd think it would keep sharp focus at the 1.8 setting, but it didn't. I'm just gonna buy the 2.8(which ive rented in the past, and loved) and be happy with my purchase.Needless to say I returned the lens a couple days later"
4,Fast lens for 1.6x SLR cameras,This lens is almost a perfect 50mm equivalent for my 1.6x SLR. The large aperture is incredibly fast and allows great indoor shooting in low light. Beware that using a UV Haze Filter causes glare across the lens. It's almost unusable with the filter on.
4,I like it,"This lens works well, and is the primary lens I've been using (but that's mostly because my other two lenses are cheap Canon lenses.) Wishing I would've bought a little bit wider of a lens, but it takes nice shots, autofocuses alright, is a comfortable fitting lens to carry around (I bought a cheap Fotodiox dedicated bayonet lens hood for cheap that I'm happy with), and the 1.8 is great. The 1.8 is the main reason I bought it; I shoot predominantly in low-light situations. I kind of wish I would've bought the canon 50mm 1.4 instead (didn't because I have the 1.8, but you'll never want to touch that lens again once you use the 1.4 -- the focus ring is actually responsive and usable!) but it's a fine lens. I'll be very glad to have it once I add some more decent lenses.EDIT: After using it more and more, I really do like it. I'm still definitely going to have to add more, but it's a very solid lens that I use often even when I have my friend's 11-16, 35, 50 1.4 and 85 1.8"
5,"This lens sounds great, but you may want to get a Canon S95 instead","In reading the reviews about this lens I really started to want one for my Canon EOS, but then I realized that for about the same money, my S95 Powershot gives me similar lens capabilities and it's a self contained camera with excellent ISO range. Probably isn't going to give quite the image quality that this lens will, but it's very impressive. I think if you're considering buying this lens and you're not a pro and don't like lugging around a your big DSLR all the time you will love the S95. Don't get me wrong, I still want the 28mm too!"
2,Ultimately: unsatisfying,"This book was interesting, but left me unsatisfied. It was an extremely small book. As a result, it couldn't ever tell much of anything because it was in too much of a hurry to get to the next topic. The author also claimed that the book should be easily understandable to anyone. As I was reading, I kept thinking, ""How would someone without upper-level mathematical training possibly understand this section.""Ultimately, I would not recommend this book. But if the goal of this book is simply to whet the appetite and cause the reader to look deeper into the subject, then I believe that his mission was a success."
3,Basic introduction to knot theory within the grasp of the second-year undergraduate,"Knot theory is one area of mathematics that has an enormous number of applications. The actual functionality of many biological molecules is derived largely by the way they twist and fold after they are created. Over the years, a great deal of mathematics has been invented to describe and compare knots.The purpose of this book is to present the fundamentals of knot theory while avoiding the fine details as much as possible. Sossinsky has succeeded in doing that; he develops the machinery used to describe knots in a manner that is generally understandable. While it is necessary that the reader have some understanding of higher-level mathematics, the level does not have to be too high. It is well within the mathematical grasp of a second-year math undergraduate. There are many diagrams to aid in the understanding."
3,Too far fetched even for Parlabane,"This is the second Parlabane I've read. Compared with ""quite ugly one morning"" which I found to be witty and insightful, I found it harder to connect with Country of the Blind. Too many Scottish references, I think.Still, a gripping detective story, full of action and drama. Too bad the plot was in no way mysterious or surprising."
2,too soft wide open; inconsistent autofocus,"While this lens will allow you to shoot in very low light, the resulting images will be very soft. It sharpens up nicely by f/4, but there are several zoom lenses (e.g. 24-105mm f/4L) that can match it at that aperture. While quick, the auto focus is not very accurate. I spent a lot of time dialing in the AF micro-adjustment on my camera (7D), and while I was able to improve the average case, the variance was just too large to yield an acceptable ""keeper"" rate."
1,I will not buy a lens again from AMAZON!,"My review is not about the lens, but about AMAZON. Today, 9-19-2012 I received my order, the 35mm L lens form AMAZON, which was not new! Both the front and back caps have marks on them. The lens hood is also scratched. I could not understand why amazon sell it as new?No warranty information was found inside the box!Beware if you are buying an expensive lens from AMAZON!"
3,Front focuses wide open,"I am guessing I have gotten a bad copy, since no one mentions this issue. The lens focuses just fine at the minimum distance, but as I step back couple of yards it starts to front focus. At first I thought it was a user error, just so strange the all the closeups were so perfect, but every time I tried to do a full body portrait the eyes were just slightly out of focus 2-3 yards away. So i started testing, first with the ruler, that showed that focus was off at least 1"" if not more at about 2 yards from the subject. At 4 yards it was about 3"" off. I don't know whether this is OK for such a pricey prime, but it's not going to work for me.Maybe I should mention that by f/2.0 AF was right on since DOF is not nearly as narrow."
5,Even More Useable Than I Hoped,"I agonized for months about this lens. It is no second thought purchase at the price. I knew I liked it since I had used a friends, but I wasn't sure how much it would be on my camera since it is a prime and i shoot in a variety of situations. It was for that reason that I was hesitating spending the money on this rather than a more ""responsible"" lens that had more versatility.When I put this lens on my camera all my fears melted away. This has become my primary lens and it rarely leaves my camera. I am addicted to the clarity and the beautiful bokeh so i always loath to use my other lenses. I don't mind moving around to get the shot either...it keeps me on my toes.I will never regret investing in this lens."
4,Rio Cot,Well made. Better than expected. Easy to put together. A little heavy but comfortable to sleep on. Good for the average built person. Is plenty long but you might need a little wider if you are built larger than the average person.
4,Great product for the price.,"Product as discribed. Cot was tight to put ends together but has velcro to loosen if needed so, the point is to be tight. Everything worked as hoped. Would buy this product again."
4,Very satisfied,"Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend it. Very easy to assemble. I used it in our camping and it's comfortable too."
1,Doesn't assemble properly,"On receiving this item I found it impossible to assemble as the hole in the cot did not allign with the pole.I have tried to return two of these (purchased in mid September) but have had no reply to two emails sent, one immediately after trying to get the thing up and another four weeks later. Will keep trying.Hard to recommend both the product or the customer service!"
3,Blue Rio Adventure cot,"I think this is good cot and easy to set up and fold it down quick and space saver, too. I think this is good size for 5'10 tall and under if you are a curl sleeper then it's probably a little uncomfortable. Strong structure cot."
3,It's....okay,I purchased this cot for my son to use when he has a friend over or when he goes camping. He likes it. It was rather difficult to set up the first time and it has two very small (hopefully they won't get bigger) holes in it. Not enough to justify time and effort to send it back but annoying none the less.
1,Poor Locking feature,The locking features on the end of the cot where the bars lock are not designed well! As a manufacturer of plastic and metal I looked at this thing out of the box and knew it would not last! .... 1 year later... it did not last. Trying to reach the manufacturer now. Cutting corners on a $.04/u piece of plastic cost them a quality product. Ughhh.....
3,About what you could expect for the price,The cot ripped after a couple of times of camping. I got it sewn with new material for another $30. The ends fall off quite often but I use a little rope with a double half hitch to keep them on now. It is really great with a Therm-a-rest Trail lite pad on it. My son sleeps on it every night and takes it camping. He has a small 3 person tent and it just fits inside.
4,Excellent Cot - large and comfy,"After a few years of sleeping on the ground while camping I vowed last year that we would buy cots the next time we camped.I searched for quite a while before settling on this cot. Just slept on them last night and both campers give this cot a thumbs ups. It is sturdy and firm and the instructions for set up are a breeze. They are high off the ground so easy to get in and out. A very convenient multi-pocket storage on the side is the prefect place for glasses or your book.Two important notes. First, this cot is heavy. It is definitely for your car camper type and not for carrying around. I wouldn't want to lug this very far. Second, this cot is long. When it arrived I had to pull out our tent to be sure two would fit. The dominate our Coleman four person tent. Fortunately only two of sleep in that four person tent.If the size and weight work for you then I would get this very affordable cot."
4,Does the trick,I bought this for when we have young guests sleep over or for when we go on the road with our 3-year-old. My 15-year-old nephew moved off it in less than a half-hour (it's a little wobbly) but my 3-year-old loves it. It's fine for what we're using it for. I'd buy it again.
4,"Solid Construction, Has a distinct 'odor'","Cot arrived before promised date in good shape. Very solid construction. Despite being used 4 times, this cot still retains a distinct odor - probably from the canvas - hopefully it will fade over time."
1,the material does not last,i purchased this product based on the amount of reviews that it received.and i made a wrong choice.the cot cover is already reaping apart.i'm so dissappointed with my purchase that i feel that is not important to return it.i hope that i don't receive another garbage product from amazon in the future. i have always trusted the quality of products that they sell.but that's the risk you take when you purchase something in good business faith.
2,Broken Part,"I received this cot a while ago and although it seems like it will work out fine, I am still waiting for one replacement end cap. The cot I was sent had one end cap without the nib on the end to make the cot work.I called the company that day and have yet to receive the replacement in the mail, it has been over a month. Guess I need to call them again."
2,Lasts for about one year of use,"I have used this product for almost a year during the nearly 2 years of ownership. At first, it was very sturdy and the fabric held tightly against the frame. After about a year of use (about 16 months) the stitching started to come loose on one side and the fabric is now sagging and more stitching is gradually getting undone."
4,Great Cot... Very Handy..,"I bought this cot for a scouting trip with my son... It works wonderfully, no more sore hips for me :)I am actually thinking about buying another one for the wife.. Very sturdy A little tough to put together but it is a good qaulity item.. I have used it twice and so far so good.. Enjoy..."
3,End bars difficult to connect,"I received this cot a few days after ordering it. It was easy to unfold.It was very difficult to put the End bars that stretched the canvas. It took a lot of time and frustration getting the end bars to stay in place while stretching the canvas over it and securing it with the velcro adhesive. When you were able to do this, the cot worked great and was comfortable to lay on and it was able to lay on it with room to spare. I think they could design the end bars better. That made it very difficult to set up.It was easy to disassemble and put back in the convenient carrying case. I might look at purchasing another cot, but with a different design."
3,a badly recorded live 5th,"The reason to pick up this disc is the 9th, an excellent recording by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. The live 5th, a 1967 recording of Mravinsky and the Leningrad Philharmonic, is an inferior recording of an excellent performance. For a much better recording of the same forces with a performance every bit as good, try instead the 1980s recording on Erato (see my review).Mravinsky and the LPO premiered many of Shostakovich's symphonies, including the 5th, and Mravinsky didn't change his interpretation much over the years, so even via the old Mravinsky of the 1980s you can still hear something very much like the original performances back when he was in his prime.See my SHOSTAKOVICH: A CENTENARY LISTENER'S GUIDE list for more of the great Dmitri Shostakovich."
3,5.1? teehee!,"Welcome to the amazing crappy sound of SIVERLINE! If you see this name on your dvd-a and dualdiscs recordings,move on. Truly worthless,except for the Curse of Blondie.It is real 5.1,but all others that I've purchased are lousy. The regular engineer at ""Silverline"" must have been sick the day Blondie mixed their gem of a cd"
2,Audio/video,"When I purchased the dvd, I was under impression it would be a live video of group doing their songs. Very disappointed because only video on dvd is a Still Picture. It would be nice if a Tracklist of Songs was included in description."
5,we play cribbage,"great deck of cards, they don't start peeling apartat the corners like papper cards.we play cribbage at work while eating lunchand if some food or something gets on these plasticcards you can wipe or rinse them off."
3,Good/Mundane,"Some of the songs here are real winners like Comes A Woman,Loosen up your Grip and Sailor but the rest of the album fails to impress."
2,The Original Chopin by Angela Lear,"Angela Lear is a British musicologist in addition to a performing artist. Her love is the study of Chopin's piano music, and she has found many discrepancies between current performing practice of Chopin's music and the autograph scores and other original documents.Unfortunately, her performances do not stand up to most of the competition. She is quite slow and even sounds inert at times. The tension, so important in Chopin's music, gets short shrift from Lear as she plays the works in much too relaxed a manner.Further, the soundstage is not up to snuff; the acoustic has a swimming quality and the bass response is too loud and indistinct."
5,Canon 14mm F/2.8,this lens is one of my favorite it is great for landscapes but at the same time the autofocus is fast enough for me to be able to capture moving items as well. i have heard in other reports that the CA(chromatic aberation) can be seen around the edges of the image when using this lens but in thousands of images i have only noticed it a very few times.
3,Commercialised Rap,"This song was absolutely fantastic, great beat, fantastic lyrics and good flow. What went wrong? Well, it has been played at least half a million times on the radio and I'm sick of hearing it quite frankly! Beautiful song, ruined by the media and poser fans."
2,fairly average,when you hear a song 99 times out of day be it on the radio or on tv you start too feel one way or the other.this song sounds like a Busta Rymes knock-off track.Eminem rises His voice up alot through out this track but the song just doesn't pack the punch of His Boasts through out it in the end overall.
1,I HATE THIS SONG!!!!!,"This song has gotten on my nevres. Why do peaple think that this is the best song ever? Its not even close to being eminem's best. I did hear better songs than this. But i will admit that i used to like it when it first came out, but then they played it every two minutes now i just hate it."
5,Great Song Ruined By Overplay,"""Lose Yourself"" is one of Eminem's best written songs. The beat and production is great and the lyrics go directly with his character in the movie as well as experiences in his own life. It's too bad that pop and rock radio, as well as music video stations killed it by playing it 5 times every hour."
4,The only good rap song from the only good rapper,"Of All Eminem songs(Yes,I've heard em all)this is the onlyone I like and the music video is not bad either.Here it is:1-Lose Yourself [4 Stars]2-Lose Yourself (Instrumental) [4 Stars]3-Renegade [2 Stars]If you like rap,you'll love it.If you like eminem,you'll love it.If you're not into rap,then don't even hear it."
1,Great episode - but no extras?,"I love Quanrtum Leap. No, I mean I LOVE Quantum Leap. But this DVD had zero extras, a cheesy menu board with chapter selection only, and the menu didn't even use the real Quantum Leap logo. It's like they didn't know what Quantum Leap was when they put the movie on the DVD. Overall, a poor DVD.Advise to producers...put the whole series on DVD and take the time to put extras and gooodies on them with menus that match the shows atmosphere, just as all good DVD's do.Leaping out...Al's Placehttp://www.quantumleap-alsplace.com"
2,Quantum Leap - The Complete First Season,"This is a great episode, but I wouldn't buy any of these until they start releasing entire seasons."
4,And so it begins,"This is an excellent transfer of the pilot episode of the brilliant TV series Quantum Leap. Now if only there was a way to get past all the copyright problems and release the entire series on DVD.The pilot introduces us to Sam Beckett, a scientist who steps in the Quantum Leap Accelerator in 1995 and awakens in 1956. Unfortunately something has gone wrong, his memory is patchy - at first he can barely remember who he is. Finding himself in the body of a USAF test pilot about to make an attempt to break the Mach 3 barrier in an experimental plane, Sam must ensure the survival of the pilot in addition to trying to restore his memory and hopefully return to his own time. Helping him out is an holographic image of his colleague, Al, who can only give him minute snippets of advice in the hope of sorting things out in both 1956 and 1995."
3,image quality disappoints,"The 24-70 2.8L should be a fantastic piece of glass - it is clear to me that canon has some serious quality control issues with this lens. I cannot find the sweet spot for image quality -- I sent the lens back to Canon, they ""repaired"" it and it came back no better than before. After I wrote their CEO, they replaced the lens under warranty. The new one is slightly sharper -- but still disappoints. Images are generally soft when viewed very critically - body is a 50D so it's not for want of pixels. Do not buy this lens without testing the one you are to purchase !!"
5,Most versitile lens I own...,"I'm addicted to this lens! This is my GO TO lens for almost everything. Even though I have an 85mm f/1.2, a 70-200 f/2.8, a 50mm f/1.4... this is the most versitile of all. Granted the others have specific uses that I won't use this for, but for events this lens is SOLID."
4,great portrait lens,Incredible lens. use it for studio portraits and outdoor portraits and the results are incredibly sharp and focus is always spot on.
5,great wide angel zoom,"I've been a Canon photog for a good 20 years, and have shot alot with their L lenses, but this is the first ""wide angel"" L lens I've owned. Being that it'f f-2.8, it will be good for, maybe indoor sporting events or general photography. I own the Canon 2.8 L IS macro lens, which makes a good portrait lens. I'm very happy with Canon lenses. I thinking of getting the f4 70-200 L IS zoom. It's a little slower then these 2.8s, but the IS will give me a 4 stop boost. That will give me an f-1.4 shooting range. I'm excited to try this."
2,Very soft even at higher apetures,I'm a novice who is working on becoming a better photographer. I bought this lens and returned it after using it for 7 days. The majority of my pictures were soft though out. I couldn't get this lens to take a sharp picture.**Note the price of this lens was $1199 back in December when I purchased it. I guess demand is very high. I ended up going with the 24-105mm instead.
5,I am very please.,"After a long time of talking myself out of dropping the large amount for an L series lens, I finally decided to bite the bullet and pick up the Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM lens. I am very impressed with the image quality that this lens constantly produces and am rather disapointed I didn't purchase this years ago.IT weighs significantly more then my non-profesional lenses, but is not awkward to carry or shoot by any means.It's true that you get what you pay for, and in this case, you are getting a really nice lens."
3,Back focusing galore :(,"I am a wedding photographer and recently replaced my 15-85mm lens with this one. I've been working toward all L-lenses for my wedding lens line up and was so excited to finally have a fast wide-angle. Well... I am extremely disappointed and frustrated right now. At 24-35mm, the lens backfocuses LIKE CRAZY! I set my own focus points, usually using center focus mode and then recomposing. This method has always worked with the other lenses I use (my most-used lens is the 50 1.4). But with this lens, I get a blurry subject and sharp background. I HAVE figured out that if I set the focus point to auto-select with this lens, it seems to work better. But still. For the money paid for this lens, it should be on the mark. Now once you are past 35mm, the lens is tack sharp and works fine with center focus. I'm stumped and wondering if I should go back to my 15-85. It wasn't fast, but at least it knew how to focus when wide open."
3,Beware focus isn't accurate,"I bought my lens after years of unsatisfying results with dedicated non-Canon lenses.The main attraction to this was the environmental seal, designed to keep out dust particles. However, after one year of use the lens has several permanent dust particles deep inside (which have to be digitally removed from the photo on a computer), although admittedly unsealed lenses were a lot worse.The primary problem with this lens is that it doesn't focus accurately at the 24mm setting. You have to zoom in to 70mm, adjust the focus, then zoom back out for the wider angle. This is infuriating if you need to work quickly - which in my case is taking live action news-related or entertainment photos. I wouldn't buy this product again; it's overpriced and produces images that aren't pin-sharp anyway."
1,"This Lens Retails At $1,399.00 - This is NOT Version II","This same lens is available from Canon at a price point of ** $1,399.00 ** - it is being replaced by version II ($2,299.00), but that is *not this lens*. This item listing is misleading and confuses buyers into paying the new price for the old lens.See [...]"
3,great lens,"great lens, but heavy. i did not like the huge hood at first, but turns out it offers great protection while in use and during storage. lens is sharp, great colors."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Extremely disappointed with this lens. Poor focus after 15', Images never sharp under any condition. Not at all what you would expect from an L series. Lots of $$$$ poor performance. Working on third copy. Unfortunately did not get chance to evaluate prior to warranty running out.CAUTION!!!!PS failed to research product reviews prior to purchase, My Bad, Better luck to all!"
1,Hmmm,"I have one of these lenses andf it's either faulty at point of purchase or it's jut not as sharp as it sould be, specially for the price!"
2,Not very sharp,"I've heard great things about this lens so I spent the $$$ on it. To my disappointment it wasn't very sharp. I'm not sure if I had a bad lens or what but I would think spending that much money it whould at least be a little sharp. I posted a few orginals on some photography sites and the most comments I got was ""its very soft"" and ""not very sharp"". I'm a die hard Canon person but I'll have to say that I'm not very happy with this lens."
3,Not as good as it should have been,I bought this after trying the Sigma and have since returned the Canon to get another copy... The lens back focused between 24-50mm but was very sharp out to 70mm. I'm looking to get my next copy locally so that I can swap until I find a sharp version. Maybe the 50D lens focus tweaking will fix this!!
1,Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L,"The lens was first released at a price point of $1350ish 10 years ago? And the current price just double that price? You gotta be kidding, especially when the version II of 24-70mm has already came out at a 2200ish price point and obviously better than this version I selling at at the same or even more than new version II. THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!"
5,The most wanted lense,"I've used several copies of 24-70mm 2.8L in the last few years. I bought two copies from Amazon. All of them are sharp, fast and accurate focus. It produces high quality images. I like this lense very much and always the first lense in my camera bag.If you are a frequent traveler and like to do landscape + street photography then this is a good choice. 24-105mm is also a good option, but I prefer 24.70mm because of 2.8 A factor. It will produce nicer colors, bokeh, ... Also, from 50-70mm, you can also produce excellent and truly portrait photos.For indoor photography with natural light (wedding, event photos) then this is a must have lense. I don't have to say much but most of wedding photographers will use this lense most often."
4,Great All purpose but still loses out in some aspects,"First off, I think that this is a great lens. The lens covers a very useful focal length, large aperture, and built like a tank (weighs like one too). So I would like to reflect many of what have said already about the good things.One thing I have found however is that color saturation and its ability to pick up detail sometimes is very lacking, especially at the long end. Compared to my 300 dollar Tamron 70-300 at 70mm, detail and saturation are lacking. Maybe this is because it is in fact at the long end but from a 1300 dollar piece of glass compared to 300 dollars I expected more. So just a caveat and a little nitpicking."
1,rip off,"Be carefull. As someone stated in the reviews, this is the version 1 of the 24-70mm lense originally sold at 1300$ for the price of the new one (2300$). In short words you will got the old one for the price of the new one. Enjoy..."
4,"Great for the professional, but a bit much for the amateur","This is a fantastic lens, don't get me wrong; incredible color, contrast and sharpness, however, it's very heavy, and is not easy for a woman to carry around - one should definitely have a tri-pod when using this lens. Mine was one of the many I have heard about with ""soft images"" - that, coupled with the fact I would need to bring so much equipment with me on the field for good shots, made me exchange it for the 28-135 with IS, which is much more portable, takes fantastic shots, better zoom range, and 1/3 the price. Sure, if you blow up the pics 200% you'll see a difference, but to me, the price, portability and IS make it a much better choice for the amateur."
5,Perfect.,"Ok here it goes. It is big,havy and in my humble opinion perfect. I broke my bank for this but I got lucky and I have a good copy to play with. All the great reviews from pros and non are true. I have nothing else to say but this "" HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY"" . This is bar non the best all around lens at this price tag.I own two more of the L class lenses. This is the one I should have bought first. Some of the negative reviews are the result of some ""soft"" in short defective lenses.They sould have send them back and get other ones. Perhaps from a different vendor.If you have the dollars spend them on the L glass.Camera bodys will become cheeper and better and most of us will upgrade again.But this lens will stay with you for a good long time and will keep its value.Look at the prices for used ones and you will understand . Always buy through Amazon. Play safe and good luck to you."
2,This lens is BIG AND HEAVY!,"I bought this lens to use for children's portrait photography and quickly learned that it will not work simply because the lens is too big and heavy to use while chasing around a child. It also does not have images stabilization (IS). The Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens is much smaller, has IS, but has a wider aperture (f4 instead of 2.8) - a welcomed trade-off after my experience. The worst part is I had to pay $50 to return it to Amazon.com since it needed to be insured - and they don't reimburse you for that cost so my recommendation is to go to a camera shop and at least hold the lens in your hands before purchasing!"
1,Terrible for an L series,"I purchased the 24-70mm f/2.8L in early December 2011. I wanted to buy the perfect portraiture and fashion lens for a 24 to 35 focal length to suit my home studio. Though I am relatively new with photography, I have owned 3 L series lenses. The standard I use to judge all lenses is Canon's EF 100mm f/2.8 macro. Tack sharp. I bought the ultra wide 17-40mm L and it was blurry. I returned it. I bought the 24-70mm f/2.8 L and it too was blurry (and not the good bokeh blurry). I am returning it today. At all times I used a tripod and a remote shutter release. The 18-55mm kit lens with IS turned off was WAY sharper in my test with the same lighting conditions. All variables were the same except the lens. I used a Canon 60D. I have sent Canon an inquiry today but I cannot imagine an explanation that would resolve the issue of how a $1400 lens is outperformed by a $150 kit lens."
3,Don't use with flash on Canon 10D - leaves a shadow,It's a great lens with a terrific picture but when it is extended for the widest angle shots the extended part of the lens blocks part of the built in flash from the Canon EOS cameras. It won't be a problem if you use an accessory flash like a speedlite but it will be a real problem with the built in flash. Most of my flash photographs have a nice dark arc without light because the lens blocks the flash. If you are going to spend that much for a lens you should know it will be a poor buy for photos with your built in flash.
1,Totally DISSAPOINTED - VeRy soft AND bad colors,"I bought it TWICE on Amazon.com (an UPDATE - I bought it 3rd time - now on eBay) and have returned it twice (I am now selling this crap) - I was so not impressed by that lens - so much hype about it and a steep price tag, but images are blurry due to the lack of image stabilization and quality is not 4 times better compare to 4 times less expensive consumer-grade lens. I'll wait for that lens to get IS finally. An Update - colors are not natural too - I have other L-series lenses and this one is totally bad, bad, bad - I am selling it - finally and forever."
4,takes great photos but it's too big and heavy,"I bought a Canon 70-200mm L series lens and loved it so much I thought there was no point in using non-L lenses anymore (assuming you can afford the L lenses). And this lens is also very sharp, although not as reliably so as the 70-200.The main drawback is this lens is a lot bigger and heavier than the 70-200mm one and as an every day lens it's just too big and bulky. It barely fit in my bag and I found myself not using the camera nearly as often once I put this lens on it. That's the sad truth.In the end I decided to get two non-L series lenses from Canon: the 50mm F/1.8 II and the 28-105mm zoom. Now I am back to using my camera again. I love both lenses because they are small, but the 50mm lens is hard to resist, working on indoor shots without a flash in ways I had hoped my F/2.8 L lens would have. With the Rebel Xt 1.6x factor, I am now considering a 28mm or 25mm Canon lens as well. I love quick lenses: it changes everything for indoor shots."
1,Excellent Lens but beware.,"This is an excellent lens. However, do a search on Amazon for the EF 24-70mm f2.8 version ii of the lens and compare prices before you purchase."
5,Jaw-Dropping Results!!,"I recently purchased this lens as general purpose use. Let me tell you that these pictures come out extremely sharp, and the saturation and contrast are dead on. The 1.6x factor on my 20D doesn't really make a difference when your shooting group or birthday shots, because it's still wide enough, believe it or not. It is a bit heavy, but you'll forget about that as soon as you see your first shot. This lens is high on my recommendation list to anybody that is looking for the best all-around lens. Don't forget about the f/2.8, so this is exellent in low-light situations too. 6 BIG STARS!!!"
3,Very sturdy lens but not as sharp as I expected,"I purchased the 24-70 2.8L and was expecting a superb lens for the price. After comparing with my 70-200 4L, the 24-70 performed worse at 70mm f4 than my 70-200 4L. At 35mm, the sharpness was only average, slightly less than my 28-135 at f4. The image does get sharper as I increase to f8 or higher, but the whole purpose of getting this lens is for the f2.8. The color and contrast was outstanding as expected from Canon L series. The lens is also big and heavy, not a lens you want carry around your neck all day. It's not very practical lens for me and copy I got doesn't perform up to optical quality I expect. I won't bother send it back to Canon for calibration. It's going back to the store."
5,Just buy it!,"Ive rented this lens several times and now I finally own one. By far in my opinion its the sharpest lens Canon makes. Its the perfect walk around lens. The contrast and sharpness it creates allows for amazingly detailed photographs. If you have to buy only one lens, make sure this is it!"
4,"Great lens, but is it worth the premium?","I wanted this lens for a long time and finally bought it. Its a great lens and the other reviewers point out all the great attributes.But to be honest, I also have a Sigma DC 17-85 F2.8 for my crop sensor 20D. That lens is nearly as sharp at all apertures. Sigma also makes a DG version for full frame cameras and is about $300 to $400 cheaper.In the end, I'm not sure the Canon L's price premium justified it because its performance in my experience isn't that much better than the Sigma DG. Read up on the Amazon reviews on the DG and you will see that the Sigma is also a great lens but 30%+ cheaper.No regrets, but my next lens may be a Sigma instead. Canon seems to keep increasing their prices with little improvement in product quality to justify those repeated increases."
5,Wonderful lens!,"After using this lens, I have found it to be my favorite. It is versatile and sturdy. Some say it is too heavy and I don't find that to be the case. It does weigh some but not enough to offset me using it."
5,"If you must start with ONE lens, this is it!","When selecting a ""starter"" lens for my new 40D, this lens looked perfect, and it is! The quality is superb (typical of Canon's ""L"" series), and the zoom range makes it a perfect all-purpose lens. I couldn't see any point in accepting what Canon (or sellers) thought were ""starter lenses"" if I was buying a good-quality camera body. I strongly suggest NOT wasting your money on a cheapie lens; this is a great ""first"" lens! I expect it to remain on my camera 90% of the time. Highly recommended."
5,Super product!!,"Heals extremely deep wounds, promotes healing from the bottom up and then the sides and then skin begins to grow. Speeds the healing process and protects from infection."
2,"not real quick to warm, and","It would have to stretch a LOT to reach the 150 degrees advertised, but it works. Have lots of rechargeable double a batteries on hand. The alkalines that came with it barely got it to seventy five degrees, then crapped out."
1,didn't work out of the box,"I bought these last year and only thought to add a review of them now as I continue my search for good hand warmers. The product descriptions don't tell you that each firepod requires 4 AA's which make them pretty heavy to tote around in each pocket. Secondly, the plastic housing they're made of is rather cheap. Installing the batteries I already chipped part of the battery door. And finally they have never worked, not a single bit. I started by installing the included factory batteries and when that didn't work I put in a fresh recharged set of batteries and still neither firepod ever warmed up."
1,Lukewarm!,"This item fails to reach the maximum temperature of 150 degrees! The batteries get hotter than the case! I bought two of these products and even tried new batteries--Duracell--on both and nothing happened!Great concept, but should work as promised! My hands are like popcicles, and require more heat than these put out. So, if you're an outdoors enthusiast, stick with disposable or reusable handwarmers."
1,I Tried,After reading the reviews on this product I still wanted to give it a try. I am not a hunter nor do I spend a lot of time out in extreme cold. I just wanted to keep my hands warm in a house set to 66 degrees. I ordered two. One did not work at all the other barely got warm (like I couldn't tell if it was just warm from being in my hand) I tried using lithium batteries with hardly any difference. These things are THE WORST THINGS I HAVE EVER TRIED. I never write reviews but I had to warn people about these.
2,2 Good songs... The rest = Garbage.,"I am going to make this quick an simple...The song ""Masquerade"" is addictive, and makes you want more, but if you buy this album you won't get any more of that crack music... You will get ALOT of garbage with the two ""Masquerade"" mixes you will love.I was raised in Tampa Florida, and Skating rinks were the scene in the mid 90's. As a child I loved this song among others.I suggest buy the Single instead of this, unless this is cheaper. I got this for $3.33 on here with Expedited shipping. Pretty good deal. I get a physical package, and pay only $1.33 more than I would have if I had just DL'ed the songs off of Itunes.For the price it's a good deal, an cop it. But cop it knowing that you will only like a few songs.Unless however cheesy songs with bad production and laughable lyrics are your fortay."
4,A 'cool idea' as one of the newspaper puns put it.,"I read this book recently after 'McCarthy's Bar', but wish I'd read it first. I can see however where Pete McCarthy pinched his ideas from.Hawks hawked (sorry!) his way around Ireland with trusty companion and, with a lot of help from RTE, in particular Gerry Ryan, gained a lot of free hospitality, which would be unthinkable in almost any other country.Yes, it was a daft idea, but it seems that not only did many people laugh with - as well as a few, at - the eccentric English 'eejit', but he himself felt a great deal of warmth for the country and it's people.The surfing had me in stiches and the Batchelor Festival cringing with embarrassment for him. It's only a shame that he didn't circumnavigate the whole island, only flitting in and out of the 'British' bit and rushed from Wexford back to Dublin.Anyway, highly recommended, it takes a few chapters to get 'into' but it's worth it!"
5,Because it's there.,"Why climb Everest? Because it's there. Why hitch-hike around Ireland with a fridge? Because it's there.Sure, maybe the latter is pointless, but so are a lot of great acheivements of humans. Hawks is a funny guy, and I found this book very entertaining."
4,Round Ireland w/ a Fridge,"Well written book, fun and enjoyable. I got this book just before I went to Ireland. The book is much better then Ireland."
5,This is no Frommer's Guide to Ireland.,"How can you resist a book with a title like this? I couldn't and am glad I didn't. It becomes apparent very early that Tony Hawks never met a pub he didn't like and ends up spending more hours signaling to bartenders than he does to passing motorists. One delightful insight he passes on is that each Irish pub has a resident drunk and more unique characters than a dozen American bars can offer. The whole concept of the journey was insane, he should have been ignored or laughed at. Neither happened, the Irish took him to their hearts and laughed not at him but with him. Thanks Tony for sharing your insanity with us."
2,Silly book,"A light read, but boy does it jump all over the place. I've been to Ireland. The people are charming and often funny. This book was Not that funny. Tries too hard to find absurd adventures to make the reader laugh. Disappointing, the author spends so little time in each place that the reader never gets to feel a sense of what the hitchhiker is experiencing beyond his inconvenience in the creature comforts. The author's writing was too choppy for my taste. And he was condescending to the very people who were trying to help him. I never got a sense of what in the world the man is trying to convey in each place. The goodness of the Irish? No. Rather, I did get the sense that Mr. Hawks was trying to make a buck off writing about his Irish adventure. Without that radio show, the endeaver never would have succeeded in a month, and it soured the effort. But it sure made ""Fridge Man"" famous."
5,"Lacked the impact of ""Round Australia with a Wardrobe""","Tony Hawks is a dirty cheat. I tried this myself before he even did it. I only got about 15 feet into the journey before a mysterious force stopped me from proceeding further. Hawks obviously must have unplugged it before he set off.I enjoyed the premise though, senseless madcap booze fuelled adventures are what make the world go around. If Christopher Columbus hadn't have had a few pints with Queen Isabella of Spain and suggested that he ""sail over the horizon for a laugh"", 96% of these reviews would not have been written.Why, I myself have been known to put a traffic one on my head and say ""Im Harry Potter!"" when leaving the pub.Hawks however fails to provide any of the skateboarding tips we might have expected from him."
3,ma ci fai o ci sei?,"...literally: ""are you really so (naive) or you simply pretend to be it?""yes, i did not appreciate the ""Troubles"" being described as... well i can't quote, it's the rule... see pages 82-83.ok, this kind of description can be a good way to express his disapproval on that conflict, but i simply felt it as noncurance, inability to go in depth when facing some more complex problems than the temperature of the shower.this is my disappoinment: i hoped to read what does an englishman think of ireland, rather than what does an englishman think of HIM WHEN HE IS IN ireland.many pages are however very well written and i would advise you to read them, if you do not expect ireland to be the protagonist: a fridge is on stage as well!"
1,round ireland with a fridge,"Having been a reader of travel essays since Paul Theroux's ""Great Railway Bazzar"" and dipping into the British travel books of the thirties, I think I can tell what is good and what isn't in this genre. What makes a for good travel book? Well, for armchair travellers, the descriptive power of the author always helps along with what they encounter and how they use it in their book. Theroux is great at this because he becomes part of the environment. He travels light,knows a bit about the place and is able to get the most from his chance meetings. Now about ""Round Ireland...."" I tried to like this book. Really. But the more I read the more fatuous it became. I'm very surprised that he found a publisher. In an genre where terrific books abound, please pass this one by."
1,"""A Pointless Exercise""","Author Tony Hawks describes his journey with the fridge as a pointless exercise. I was intrigued by the possibilities of his comical take on his Irish journey. After reading his book however I can't quite figure out which exercise was more pointless, his journey or my time wasted reading about it. This booked seemed to fail on all levels. As a travel book it offers little in the way of information. As a book to detail the Irish personna as seen from the outside he offers little other than ""stage irish"" observations which at times seem to be delivered in a condesending manner which befits his British background. Even as book written by someone who makes their living as a comic, I found few humourous anecdotes. For those looking for books in this vein I would recommend McCarthy's Bar or more highly No News at Throat Lake by Lawrence Donegan."
4,Good light reading,"A good fun read, especially for something to pick up and put down easily when you don't want to read a huge heavy tome. Great holiday reading."
4,A Fun Read!,"This is a very enjoyable tale! I was a little disappointed when I found out that the ""fridge"" was a little cube model, not a full sized Amana, but everything else is a lot of fun. To win a ridiculous bet, Tony decides to hitchhike around Ireland with a fridge in tow. A local radio station gets wind of his scheme, and follows his itinerary around the country. He ends up having some fun adventures along the way, including lunch with some Benedictine nuns, and everybody gets into the spirit, or the ""craic"", of his journey. It's a fun read, with some delightful descriptions of the Irish countryside mixed in with a lot of good humor!"
5,It lives up to it's title,"Tony Hawks is quite entertaining, this story of his trip toting a refrigerator around Ireland is a fun read. It shares his journey and introduces the people he meets along the way. My favorite aspect of the book was that this was a true story, the poeple were real. The included pictures made me feel like I was right there with Tony all along the way."
2,Round Ireland with a Fridge,"This is a difficult book to get into. It rambles and rambles. Lacks conciseness...I am an avid reader (10 or more books a month) and it took me three attempts to get past the first 20 pages. Nothing grabs you. It is somewhat confusing as to why he is doing this, how he is doing this and how does he have the time, money etc. TO do it. I finally got about halfway through the book and gave up. It never did grab me. I expected it to be fun reading...it wasn't."
2,just ok.,"This book seems to be an interesting story when you first hear about it, but it's not that exciting of a read. Some parts are interesting, even a little funny, but it just seems to go on and on, and is pretty boring overall. I would not recommend this book to anyone. :("
3,Well the title says it all...,"If you ever wanted to know if it was worthwhile to travel Ireland with a fridge in tow, Tony Hawks has the book for you. Taking an odd bet that he could hitchhike around Ireland while bringing a fridge, Hawks takes an often comical, if predictable journey. It starts a bit slowly as Hawks disposes of the necessary details of how this came about but picks up as Hawks starts to confront some of the problems this type of journey obviously entails. Meeting a number of eccentric characters, which seems to be requirement in these types of travelogues, Hawks is a clever, occasionally repetitive, tour guide with many of the episodes involving too much Guinness and getting dragged into odd situations, but taking the fridge surfing may be an all time classic. I basically would have liked the book to be a bit funnier as I wasn't expecting any actual depth, but for a light hearted look at one aspect of Irish hospitality it's a bit of fun."
5,The Philadelphia Orchestra recording is more pleasing,"I have another recording of this piece with Toscanini. I find that the Philadelphia Orchestra recording is more pleasing. There seems to be a misplayed note in the first movement, but even more than that, the Philadelphia version is better played and more relaxed."
3,A little bit about a lot of topics,"This book gives a little bit of information about a lot of different topics. Therefore, you may find a tidbit here or there that adds to your knowledge. However, because the book covers so many topics, the amount of in depth detail is very limited. For this reason, rather than getting this book, I would prefer to spend my money getting more specialized books on specific climbing topics rather than trying to get a little bit about everything from this book. If this is the only advanced climbing book you are going to buy and your experienced friends can fill in the blanks, then it would be a good introductory book for you."
3,You should know what you don't know after reading this book,"As other reviews have mentioned, you get a little bit of everything in this book, and I think that's what it is good for.I picked this book up when I was moving from a beginning top rope/gym climber to a more advanced multi-pitch trad climber. This booked helped me know what concepts I had a strong grasp on, and what concepts I needed to study further.If you are already comfortable with your climbing technique then there are many better books such as those published by ""The Mountaineers Outdoor Experts Series"".If you know you still have a few things to learn, then by all means, pick up this book and you will get a good idea of what you do and don't know."
2,never again from the same authors,"technically useful, but written in an irritative prolo-supposed-funny language, and culminates with offensive comments about ""European trash"" climbing sites. Must be good to promote the patriotism of the USA climbers."
5,A most undeserved neglect,"I write this review in the almost certain knowledge that it is very unlikely to be read by more than a handful of people. I hesitate to make unreasonable claims for I have seen reviews written by people with an agenda who claim excellence and relevance for books of degrees of talent varying from the mediocre to the laughable which they claim were created by people of genius.But I promise you - find this book. If you cannot (and it is listed in Alison & Busby paperback by Amazon with a 3 month wait)find Johanna at Daybreak or One Light Burning. But try, try, try to find Recollection of a Journey. The writing is sublime, at least a sentence a page to note and re read. An unforgettable story, often painful to share but ultimately profoundly affecting and uplifting. RCH is the most neglected English writer of the 20th century. If you read this - and read the book - let me know what you think. I've introduced him to at least 10 people, readers of all kinds, and they all agree."
2,"Ok, but not great...","I would prefer to give it two and a half stars, but I'll have to stick with two. Perhaps I criticize the book unfairly -- I saw ""Jackie Brown"" before reading the novel. I have read several other Leonard books, and this was just not my favorite. He has a fantastic ear for dialogue, but here I often found that it overshadowed the plot, storyline and characters. Although I enjoyed Max Cherry's more substantial role, I found it hard to care about Jackie Burke, Louis, Melanie or Ordell. The over attention to dialogue also led to lags in the story. This is ok for a plane ride, but for a better taste of Elmore Leonard (in this reader's humble opinion)read ""Get Shorty"" instead."
2,Structural disaster with bland plot!,"I have heard so much about Elmore Leonard and how I would love his works. I have a couple of his books sitting on the shelf for quite awhile and finally got around to reading this and am a little unclear as to where the large scale appeal comes from. The plot here is pretty basic and I was waiting for something unique or unpredictable but it never happened. It was pretty basic. My biggest problem was with both the dialogue and the structure of the book. Many many times it was difficult to keep track of conversations and who was talking and what they were talking about. Overall, this is something that I would have been fine skipping."
4,...,"Like many others, I read this book after watching ""Jackie Brown."" I hadn't read a Leonard book before, so was unsure quite what the writing would be like. I was pleased to find that it didn't try too hard to be deep and descriptive. The story moved and was a quick read.The interesting things about ""Rum Punch"" is also what makes ""Jackie Brown"" a really good film. Leonard has other side plots and stories happening that don't appear at all in the film, so there are still some surprises for those who watched the movie. Yet, for the movie story, it was definately good to cut those out as it really tightened up the flow of the story.The best thing about the book was the ending. In ""Jackie Brown,"" Tarantino takes the ending beyond ""Rum Punch's"" by a hair... making a conclution for the viewer that Leonard had let the readers make for themselves. I prefer the way Leonard doesn't make any definate conclution about whether Max goes with Jackie or if he stays with his bail bonds business."
5,This is a great novel,"I love Elmore Leonard and I think that this is his best novel. Everyone is a bad guy underneath, even the law enforcement officers. Again, Leonard writes excellent dialogue for all of his characters and writes a very entertaining story. If you liked the movie Jackie Brown then you should definately give the book that inspired Tarantino to make the movie. If you like stories where everything gets messed up and nobody really wins then give Rum Punch a read."
4,I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!,"I have come to love Leonard's work.I didn't think he could top Maximum Bob, but this book has witty scoundrels that are credible. In fact Ordell could live down the block. I loved the plot configurations wherein justice is served, albeit in a wicked , twisted way.Leonard's books read like screenplays and all the characters that are in the movie version come to life here. One of the main characters race is changed but this does not take away from the story.I loved the streetwise dialogue.The rationalizations the characters give for their lives, the messes they have made of it, are a hoot.Ordell is completely amoral and considers his indiscretions as the natural order of things.Every character gets what is coming to them, and it feels right"
3,Ok.,"Once, more Leonard put together a good story with good characters, but it lacked Leonard's usual sense of cool. Tarantino's film was surprisingly more stylish, funny. It's a good book, but I'd call it sub-par for Leonard. I wouldn't reccomend it."
3,"Not Great, but maybe worth the read","I was a little disappointed. This was my first Elmore Leonard book, so maybe I'm missing out on something better. But there were some great characters. There were also some memorable scenes. But the plot just wasn't compelling enough. Even so, I can't say I didn't enjoy the book."
3,OK,"I was a little surprised early on when I realised I'd seen this book as the movie, `Jackie Brown'. Although it started differently, the giveaway was the description of the bail bonds office - they really caught the feel of the place in the movie. There were a few changes here and there - the white Jackie Burke of the book became the black Jackie Brown in the movie, and Max the bondsman is more central, but the flavour of the thing was all here, and the movie was pretty faithful. I wasn't reading it as a foil for the movie, but I wonder if I would have enjoyed it more or less if I hadn't seen Tarantino's spin on it.Max was likable, the characters, settings and plot all capably done. Still, nothing really soared for me here either - there are other crime writers (Hammett, Perez-Revert?, Chandler, McCall Smith) I'll look for first."
3,Good But Not That Good,A good idea with interesting charcters. Which are certainly a good contrast to one another. The book was well written and his use of his character was good. However the plot lacked the excitment it needed to keep me really hooked. I thought parts of it were unecessary to the plot. It was generally a good read but it wasn't a book I couldn't put down.
2,couldn't get into it,"I enjoyed the film based on this novel, but couldn't get into reading it. I don't know why, maybe it's just me. Maybe because the characters in the movie were changed too much...I don't know...but I just lost track of the book less than half way through."
5,Better than the movie,"For obvious reasons, I say that this is so much better than the movie. First of all, it gives you actually FEELINGS the characters are experiencing. And thanks to Leonard's wonderful way of changing the point of view, you never lose interest. The events are fast and quick, the dialogue so good I wondered why Tarantino did a thing to it. The story is very simple, and the scenes drawn out mostly by the dialogue and a few descriptive terms to let your mind fill in the details. All I can say now is that the movie, if you have seen it, is nothing compared. This is a must-read for anyone who likes action and love and guns and a very intense ending. The last forty pages run through your fingers like sand. Vintage Leonard!"
1,Terrible,"Elmore Leonard writes as if he understands nothing. He has no feel for his material. Much of the credit for the rewriting of the story is much deserved by Quentin Tarantino. Leonard involves pointless conversations and meaningless details. It is so corny that I COULDN'T stand his words. The plot is much refined when it was made into the movie, Jackie Brown. The author writes as if he is super cool like Ordell Robbie. Basically, he makes Ordell as a joke just the same way he makes a joke out of his work. Rum Punch is too tedious to read that I was dying for the last page. There are good ideas, but he fails to let them flow."
5,better then the movie,Jackie brown is a exciting crime novel. The book is better than th e mvoie because the book gieves a better discription of the events and gives you a better look of the what's going inside the character's heads.
5,Had for 29 years!!!,"I've had this Waterpik handheld shower sprayer for 29, going on 30 years! The cosmetics have changes slightly, more trim-line and less boxy. I just bought a second one for a separate bathroom. I was very excited to see that they still made them. In the 29yrs I have had this, it has never leaked, dripped, or given me any problems. I am still using it to this day. I would definitely highly recommend this Waterpik handheld shower sprayer!"
3,"Good product, but low pressure","Its ok, but there appears to be some sort of non-removable internal flow regulator that I'd rather not have."
1,Looks good in the box- leave it in there.,"Went through 2peerless showerheads and 4waterpik showerheads because of shoddy quality and operation and high price. this was number 5, i figured its tried and true design would make for a good product.the plastic is cheap- the dial feels like its connected to nothing, and has no click, making changing the settings guesswork. out of the box i saw that the pivot ball was almost welded in- even with vise grips i couldn't budge it, so then i just removed the screen and regulator and threw it on. it had no pressure with the regular spray, and the massage mode was incredibly loud- like putting plastic in a blender, it then started to leak internally after 5mins.so in short, it was a low pressure, loud, overpriced, biggest piece of junk that i have ever seen.spend $20 on the similar model- maybe then its worth it."
2,Not the old Teledyne unit,"I agree with the other reviewers that have a problem with the quality of this expensive unit. When WaterPik spun off from Teledyne in 1999 the quality went straight downhill. (The quality actually started to go down in the late 1980's, but this might have something to do with the spin off) This unit is not worth over $40.00.I had a few of the 5-mode units in the past and have switched over to the model #JM-351 (3-mode) which goes for $9.00. It is much lighter and easier to handle, and will clog up just as fast as the $40.00 version."
2,Not Like the Original,"Unfortunately, this Waterpik is not as well-made and of the same quality as the original Teledyne Waterpik. The Waterpik showerheads still, however, have the best shower massage I've found, but the cheap plastic head and cord simply do not measure up. We returned the product. I did contact Waterpik customer service before purchasing this showerhead and they were very nice and helpful. Too bad their product doesn't match the quality of their customer service. Perhaps another shower head that isn't made of plastic would garner a better rating."
2,Not usual Waterpik quality,"Waterpik is the only brand of shower head I have owned. This item is very poor quality. I installed this in February, within a week it it was leaking from the sides, water shooting all over. I am not happy. I would like to exchange it for another, but am in fear the same thing will happen."
4,Very HOT Album,"Another CD in the series of Breakbeat Science Exercises... starts out a little weak but ends up not disappointing in the end. Take a listen... at this price, how could you not?!"
3,Wrote a review before,Some of the information is helpful. Some does seems bigoted. I wonder why my last review was taken down? Perhaps because I was critical of the author?
1,Very hidden meaning,"Yes, this book has a lot of novel information and the author offers no rational or empirical validation for the diversity of psychotic topics he fabricates. I didn't think it took 700+ pages to tell the world you're crazy, but Niles eloquently externalizes his schizophrenia in this classic tome of wisdom, or something. Do not read this book. But, if you must, then make sure you go to Niles' website and buy his panacea pills, they're expensive!"
1,Total Fluff,"In between books, Mr. Carr must be busy posting positive reviews of his own books (or asking friends and relatives to do so). I agree with several of the other 1-star reviews -- this book is complete fluff, and I fail to see how it has garnered so many positive reviews. Indeed, the instruction manual to my VCR has more substance than this ""drivel"" (to borrow one of Mr. Carrs oft-used words). This book is the Easy Way to stop buying Mr. Carr's Easy Way books."
1,This book is a joke!,"I read this book hoping for a decent albeit ""easy way"" out of my drinking problem. Unfortunately, one cannot argue with an addict, which is what Carr intends to do. There is no science, no hope, and no reason to be found in this book. Don't waste your time or your money."
4,The Easy Way To Stop Drinking,"This is a do-it-yourself book for anyone who genuinly wants to stop drinking. It is very easy to read and debunks a lot of myths about alcohol and the problems with stopping. It is a waste of time for anyone who does not genuinly want to stop drinking but for the others it is brilliant. It actually causes the reader to look at themselves and their habits in a totally different light. Allen CARR calls this the easyway and he is correct, but that is because of the commonsense way the book is written without the psychobabble. I would reccomend this book to anyone who genuinly wants to stop and up to now has found it too hard."
5,Awesome Book for addiction,We have used this book in our family and this works.We decided to buy the book after we checked it out from the library.I can only say that Allen Carr is right on. This is the best route by far to deal with Alcohol addiction. Thanks
5,Best book to quit drinking,"I had a drinking problem with beer. Couldn't quit no way even with rehab. I saw this book in a bookstore and said to myself, ""Oh yeah right. Easy to quit drinking?"" I bought it anyway and read it in a couple of weeks. I haven't had a beer for 6 months and don't miss it. I don't know why it works; it just does. I didn't have any problem quitting either. It actually was easy. I just sent this book to my sister too. I hope it helps her. If you or someone you love needs help quitting drinking, this is the book to buy."
2,Disappointed....,"After reading all the great reviews and realizing I had a problem I needed to control, I was hoping this would be the answer. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I have read this book cover to cover and to me, all it centers around is willpower, which I lack or else I wouldn't have bought this book. We all know the cost and health issues of alcohol, no surprise here. We all know that alcohol does not solve our problems but only numbs them, has no real benefits, etc. I didn't need this book to know that. I'm glad that it helped so many others here, but fell very short for me."
2,The Easy Way to Stop Drinking,It seemed like it took for ever for Carr to get around to his point. There was a lot of self promotion for a message that most of us implicitly understand. Perhaps a short essay would hav been best for this approach to stopping drinking. There are probably much more useful books out there for this difficult subject.
1,Not for me...,"I was very disappointed in this book. I was looking for a resource to help educate me on the physiological and health impacts of drinking alcohol - mainly so I could improve my fitness and lose weight. This book is a collection of the author's personal stories and opinions on why one should stop drinking and it offers suggestions on how to view the problem with alcohol abuse so people will hopefully quit drinking.There is very little, if any, scientific evidence or data provided in this book. Maybe that's good for some people but I'm looking for facts, not fluffy, motivational pep-talks."
2,Too much description not enough help.,I got nothing but a waste of time reading this. I couldn't get through most of it because it was useless.
1,Full of non sequiturs,"Drink as you normally would while you are reading this book and, when you finish it, have one last drink to toast the fact that this is your last. Incredibly, this is the actual advice of Mr. Carr. He attempts to make arguments with a semblance of logic but all of them are non sequiturs. He offers no independent support for any of his arguments as to why you shouldn't drink. Most people quit addictions on their own (The Truth about Addiction and Recovery by Stanton Peele, PhD.) and for those who are ready to do so, reading this book will only create a minor hindrance. For anyone else, it could be a major impediment. If I could give it less than one star, I would.There are many effective addiction recovery programs (I like SMART Recovery myself). This is not one of them."
4,Very big handbag!,"It's bigger than it looks in the picture, which is great. It's very pretty, the only bad thing about it is that it doesn't have an authenticity certificate. Also, the only thing that keeps the handbag closed broke like 4 days after I bought it, so it's not very safe... But other than that I really recommend it... :)"
1,"Sketchy, at best","Alas, calling oneself a scholar, a researcher, a writer, or a rabbi does not make it so.But probably anyone who accepts Mr Pollina's claim that he is ""great"" or ""distinguished"" (he appropriates for himself the title ""Rav"") is a good candidate for reading this book.Anyone else will find almost anything by Moses Maimonides to be more useful."
1,Returned two of them,The tank itself was nice but heavy. Only problem is it came with no hose. You get just as pictured. The description states you will get a nice threaded hose. I ordered a replacement and it too came w/out a wand/hose. Sent both back very unhappy.
3,Front focus problem,"I have been using this extender with my canon 70-200mm f/4 L IS and Canon 5D Mark 1 body. Together, this lens and body has produced sharp in focus photos.The extender has consistently front focused enough that all the bird's eyes are blurry in favor of a sharp pole or wire. Where it is focusing, slightly closer to me, it is very sharp. My Canon 5D does not have focus adjustment, so I'll return this unit. Since DXO does not have a module for this combo, I think I will wait a while before I consider ordering another. Though about the Mark III extender, but it is nearly half the price of my zoom - just not worth that extra reach."
1,I must have gotten a bad copy,"I had heard this converter would produce acceptable results when used on a nice fast prime lens and wanted to give it a try for sunny conditions. I used this converter on a 7D body and Canon 300 mm f2.8 IS lens. I was surprised that the results were very poor quality, both in sharpness and missing focus. The 300 f2.8 with the converter installed missed focus almost as often as my Canon 100mm - 400mm f4.6-5.6 IS lens and the quality was on par with the 100-400 so I returned the converter for a full refund.It seems some bodies don't play nice with focus and quality using 1.4x II converters. I expected some loss of sharpness but had heard that the 300 f2.8 was a lens that would produce acceptable quality with a 1.4x II converter. For some reason the converter I purchased new from a well-respected vendor did not produce acceptable results."
4,canon 1.4x II extender,"This is a great addition to the accessories bag if you need that littleextra mm for distant photo's.I experienced too much pq loss to be totallyconvinced this was what I really needed. I am better served with a longerlens for those keeper shot's, I have gotten spoiled with my [L] lensquality picture's.This may work fine on some len's with good light andshort to moderate distance's, this is a quality product and may work wellfor some people."
3,No Majic bullet here!,"I bought this extender in hopes of liting my load when out in the feild. I shoot a Canon 40D and a XTI as my backup. My thought was attach this baby to the back of my canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS and extend my range and leave the Canon EF100-400L F/4.5 5.6IS at home when not out birding. Auto focus and IS work well on the 2.8 but as you know it does not work for the F/4.5 Well here it is, image quality suffers to much for my taste. For a guy like me this must be used when on a tripod. I dont believe this is the soulution for a serious photographer or even serious amiture. take the 300 bucks and stash it away for a lens with a longer focal legth and buy what you want the first time. Just my two cents!"
4,Let me comment on the 100-400mm with the 1.4x extender,"Don't do it! It sounds just plausible on paper, with a 1D professional camera it'll even autofocus using the central focal sensor (on lesser bodies it won't autofocus unless you tape up some contacts to fool the camera into trying, then it'll sometimes autofocus), and the 1.4x generally doesn't soften images too much. But no. It's not a usable combination on either professional or amateur bodies, the image quality just takes too much of a hit.The four stars are for using this well built tool with a more appropriate lens, the 70-200mm f/2.8 or any of the telephoto primes. But there are lots of reviews telling you that."
4,Work as designed,"Good product. I knew already (obvious) it would turn my 70-200 f/4 into a 98-280 f/5.6, but I was not sure what the effects would really be when I bought it.The product is well constructed and have very good optics. I would definitively recommend.The only reason I dont give 5 start is because I think Canon should improve documentation on their website, explaining better the effects of the extender (reducing speed in 1 f-stop)."
2,Auto focus not working,"I have a Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 L IS USM but it is still not long enough for shooting birds. I searched on the web and found that Canon EF 1.4X II ExtenderCanon EF 1.4X II Extender Telephoto Accessorywill work with my lens with auto focus. So I ordered it through Amazon. However, it turned out that the auto focus does not work once this extender is attached to my 100-400mm lens! So I have to return it to Amazon. I still need an extender that can work with my Canon 100-400mm lens with fast auto focus capability but just can't find it yet."
5,Pricy but nice,"Be sure the lenses you have will work with the unit. I have seven lenses for my canon and it works only on the 100-400 ""L"" series. Course I bought it to extend that lens and it does a great job on it. But, it DOES NOT work with the great EF 24-105 f/4.0 'L'lens.A hex on Canon for not making a lens capability list easily available!"
2,canon extender won't interface with Tamron lens used on Canon 30D,How disappointing! I expected the Canon 1.4x extender would fit my Canon 30D with Tamron 18-200 lens which I have used with 2 Canon cameras but alas the mount for the lens has a part sticking out so that the Tamron which fits on Canon camera won't fit on Canon extender lens. It seems it will only fit with a Canon fixed focal length lens. Would be nice if the ad makes that clear before ordering.
5,Prime Suspect#6,Just love Helen Mirren. I have them all. I wish there were more. She is a striving woman in a men's world.
1,Poorly packaged.,"I ordered the entire series of this excellent show. Unfortunately, I had to order episode #5 three times before I got one that arrived undamaged. Seems the discs were not properly secured inside the package and they arrived scratched. I was not pleased to have been charged the cost of return shipping to Amazon. I will think twice before ordering anymore DVDs from Amazon."
5,The entire series,"Helen Mirren is a superb actress-we all know that--what this series gives you is a look at the Brits other than the rose garden,white fence cottage or the Downton Abbey--it is raw in comparison..raw in the way people treat each other, the way they live, the places they live look like a ghetto in Russia-boxes of cement 10 stories high, no protection,little privacy and a sense of hopelesness--also shows that choices made along the way can come back to you-even the strongest and most determined can fall victim to themselves--I will probably watch the entire series again--I know I missed something along the way."
5,Excellent,"Excellent, as always. Helen Mirren is always fantastic, PS is written well. I don't find the heroine a likeable character but certainly a complicated one. Worth getting."
2,Needs subtitles,"As an American, I would love to be able to understand the dialogue. All the stories are very good, but the language is a problem. The only person I can understand most of the time is Helen Mirren."
3,300mm f4 sharp but slow and noisey,"I own the 70-200mm 2.8 IS and didn't have enough reach for birds so I bought the 300mm f4 IS and used it with the 1.4x. I found the images very sharp, but the noise of the IS kicking in is quite noticable and also the focus was slow. My other lens was smooth, quite, and fast compared to the 300, and I was somewhat unhappy about the focus and noise of the lens. Seems like for the price, it would be alot quieter and faster to focus. It does shoot sharp though, and maybe I can live with the other problems.."
2,Poor copy,"I received a poor copy of the 300mm f/4 from Amazon.com. Unsharp at all apertures, and a ton of chromatic aberrations, even at f/8. Obviously there was something wrong with the optics. Could have been a bad copy from Canon, could have been Amazon's terrible packaging. Either way, it cost me $30 to insure/ship/return the faulty lens to Amazon!"
5,Observation,"A loverly book; however, the indication that it is a pre-teen book is off the mark. While children between 9-12 could indeed enjoy this book, it would be more correct to label it for ages 9-adult."
3,For the serious Beene-ster only.,"To be honest, I was a little disappointed by the book.The copy was lacking and drawings looked more like something a bored nine year old would draw during an American History class.There are much better books out there on Mr, Beene to be had."
4,Only for the beach,"This product is good for the beach. If you just want to work on a sunless tan, you should use a non-oily aerosol spray after your shower and before dressing (like L'Oreal Sublime Bronze Salon Airbrush or Neutrogena micro-mist airbrush sunless tan) which dry in just a few minutes. The Banana Boat Deep Tanning Oil is, as the name implies, oily and the oil is not really absorbed by the skin. Good for the beach, and you probably want to shower so it doesn't stain your sheets."
2,"Good, for a few years","My VAN-420A started popping like an automatic firearm then blew out my sub-woofer and part of my receiver as it melted down and began smoking. Luckily I was able to pull the plug hopefully before it destroyed my $2000.00 computer and my $1400.00 APC UPS. The power cord was so hot I thought it was going to melt as I yanked it from the back of my computer. Smoke damage to my $1000.00 TV cabinet. Have to buy a new receiver, power supply, Bluray player, and hopefully not a new $1500.00 Infinity surround system (will find out when the new receiver shows up on the 10th). I have been building dozens of computers for over 15 years, this is only the second PS to fail, and the first to damage anything other than the PS. Very unacceptable."
2,Not a winner.,"I'm afraid the Dillman/Masefield series is getting very repetitious, and this novel is a good example. The protagonists investigate thefts and a murder on a voyage from England to Egypt and wrap things up before the vessel reaches Port Said. However, it's the same cast of shipboard characters with diferent names, and not much new happens, although the author tries to introduce variation by adding a purser who is hostile to the detectives and the appearance of Genevieve's former fiance, a creep if ever there was one. There are lots of red herrings, and, as it turns out, two sets of villains, but one has the nagging sense of having read it all before. Maybe there's just nothing left to do to liven things up on board. Pirates??"
5,The Best Conrad Allen mystery to date,"Murder on the Marmora, brings us back in time to a point where travel on the ocean was the only way to get to where you were going, and the most luxury that you could find anywhere. These ships were also a great place for the criminal element.In this story we follow George Dillman and Genevieve Masefield as they track down confidence men and more sinister characters. Like the title suggests there is a murder on board and it is up to Dillman and Masefield to solve the crime.With great detail, many characters are brought into the story, and fans of Allen will delight in meeting Genevieve's former fiancée. The characters and settings are rich in detail, and the mystery will keep you turning the pages.Again Conrad Allen scores a touchdown with Murder on the Marmora."
5,Amazing as always,"What can be said about these guys that hasnt already been said. They always seem to amaze me when I hear something new from them. I have been an avid fan of hybrid since Wide Angle came out and have loved every minute of their material. This new album touches deeper into their grown up sound while still maintaining the unique style they have developed from the beginning. You get a taste of breaks, house and downtempo with this album plus their beautiful orchestrated ensembles flow over these songs to add just the right emotion. If you are a Hybrid fan, theres no question if you want to buy it or not. If your new to Hybrid's unique style, be prepared to fall in love with something that will emotionally move you from the first track."
3,an incident in the history of poe--and wallace--studies,"Shortly after the turn of the century Wallace published two articles in ""Fortnightly Review"" concerning what he thought was the discovery of a previously-unknown Poe poem titled ""Leonainie."" He was soon told that the poem was a prank played by the Indiana writer James Whitcomb Riley, but at first refused to believe that intelligence. The Marriot letters contain a good deal of analysis by Wallace on the poem, and are informative both with respect to Poe studies, and to Wallace himself, who is known primarily for his role as a scientist (in the development of the theory of natural selection, and as a field naturalist). P.S.: No one seems to know much about the genesis of this little collection of letters--an unknown compiler put it together sometime between the dates of the letters themselves--around 1904--and its original library cataloging date, in 1930."
2,Pretty complicated,"Lots of fairly intricate designs, but no actual photos of a finished piece. Very few designs in color. It would take someone with a whole lot more experience than I have to complete these."
2,Disappointed,"There is a good sampling of easy and more challenging patterns in this book, but the majority are not very artistic or graceful. I wish a color rendering was provided for each design, because there are several patterns which I find difficult to interpret."
4,Not The Greatest Pattern Book,"I guess I was expecting a little more variety. There are some nice simple patterns here, nothing outstanding. It's a good book for beginner-to-moderate stained glass skills."
5,~Virtuoso Performances Of Six Masterpieces For Violin & Orchestra~,"Niccolo Paganini is one of the most talented violinists that has ever played or composed for this instrument in human history, and the recordings in this box set are absolutely first rate! The Orchestre Philharmonique de Monte-Carlo does a great job accompanying and providing the soundscape/launching pad for violinist Alexandre Dubach's outstanding virtuoso solos. He plays these concertos with complete authority and in outstanding fashion: at times smoothly & elegantly while at other times a bit dryly with just enough gritty roughness to bring out all of the best qualities of his instrument. These compositions are amongst the most technically challenging works ever written for violin and to have them all here digitally recorded & in one set at such a bargain price is delightful!Easily and highly recommended box set that runs just over 3 1/2 hours on three discs.Enjoy & God bless :-)"
2,Not sensitive enough for f/1.4,"I bought this screen to use with a manual focus Zeiss Planar T* 1,4/85 ZE. The image split is not large enough to allow a sensitive reading when the lens is used with f/1.4. The actual focus can be off several inches (ears very well in focus, while you target for the eyes, etc.)."
2,REALLY disappointed,"I ordered this for my granddaughter because at not yet 3 yrs old, the Enchanted Movie is the only movie she loves and only one she will watch at my house....she knows it all by heart. I received it today to find that the dress was not white at all, the gloves were yellowed too and there is a tear in the neckline at the right shoulder. I paid over $[...] for it and I am just sick about it."
1,"A cheesy waste of money, forget this doll.","No wonder Target lowered the price! I bought this doll thinking it would be lovely. It is poorly made and really quite awful. I cannot return it which makes me sick because I paid a fortune for it and as a barbie collector (this is a disney product, I guess)I can truly say to parents save your money for something else. Yuck!"
4,Every girls dream,The movie was so fantastic that I knew my daughter had to have this doll. She loved the way she looked on Christmas morning in the box with that huge white gown. It was a hit.
2,Outdated Recording Doesn't Hold Up,"There's little doubt that, at the time, the Toscanini/Shaw collaborations were models for decades of classical music listeners. However, today, with the advancements in recording techniques and the availability of a wide-range of performers, these recordings are beginning to sound dated. The studio sound of the recording definately limits the dramatic impact, especially of this Missa Solemnis. The soloists, too, sing in a dated style which only serves to detract and not inspire.The tempi are also too slow and Toscanini inspires very little ""magic"" from the orchestra. Again, the studio recording often produces a sawing tone from the strings and a blasting tone from the brass. All in all, listeners would be better suited by more modern recordings."
5,Armadillo studs,This pair of sterling silver armadillos are the just the thing if you're from Texas. They are small and wear beautifully with any color. Tell the world that you're from Texas.
5,tiny and unique,These earrings are different and very detailed. They are high quality and people are always commenting about them.
2,Not comfortable and tight head band,It does not look attractive. It makes me sweat when I wear it. The feel is kinda it's squeezing my head.
2,Great sound but doesn't last well,We bought one of these about a year ago. It has really good sound and we liked it for awhile. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be made well. The IPOD connectors get pushed out of shape and the IPOD doesn't keep contact. Now we use a dish towel to make sure the IPOD stays in place and connected. The remote stopped working about a month ago as well.I'll try do a video of our wonderful dishtowel supported iYiYi and how the IPOD will not stay connected.
2,does not support newer Ipod devices,"Since the system does not have the means to have its firmware updated, and apple sees fit to modify the hardware interface to each ipod/itouch/iphone device it creates, this unit is stuck in the past. Expensive to boot. Ours are still working fine after 3 years but, I wouldn't buy it again as other vendors are doing a much better job with sound quality, features, and new device support."
3,"Not bad, but....","Not bad sound, but for $100 more you can buy a re-furbished Bose Wave Radio (with CD player) that blows the doors off the Tivoli. I bought one and returned it...speaking of which, dealing with Expo NJ was quite easy and they were very amenable, I had my refund in short order."
2,Same old thing AGAIN,this is redo of about maybe 1/2 of the rock albums from the late 60's and early 70's...... hasn't this been done before???
5,Great CD.,"While I was, and continue to be, a big fan of the LA punk scene during the late seventies and early eighties, John Doe stands out as a real musical and lyrical talent among so many others that were simply able to ""strike a chord"" among the angry youth audience. John Doe has written a thoughtful retrospect that has elements of rock, punk, folk, and country. Rarely is an album released where I am able to enjoy more than one or two songs. This album is chocked full of great tracks."
2,Same image quality as kit lens!!!,"Reading the reviews, why do you all sound like sales people? What is in it for you if I buy or not??I have been using my kit lens EF-S 18-55mm 3.5-5.6 IS on my Rebel Xsi. I was looking for a lens that would give my pictures that punch/pop sharpness even when viewed in my LCD.I decided to try an L series lens...took a bunch of tests various conditions...anylized in PS...NO DIFFERENCE IN SHARPNESS/IMAGE QUALITY! Went back to store and salesman couldn't explain.The IS in kit lens actually made it sharper when shooting handheld indoors!The L was blurry.The construction of L is certainly better, but image quality wise...the same.Is there a lens that will produce a better quality image than the kit lens?Prove it. The sample pics posted with each lens do not convince me.Is there some one else in the same situation who has found the solution?"
3,buyers read this,"I am frankly quite disappointed with the overall experience... coupled with the digital rebel xt, this $650 lens wont give you any more sharpness than the 50mm f/1.8 which runs at about $70. Further, at 17mm (27.2mm equivalent on the xt) the wide angle distortion is very visible...Also between 35-40mm, the lens' transmitted contrast degrades very fast (look at the MTF charts on canon's website). Further, in low light conditions, the f/4 isn't very helpful...The UV filter runs at about $40. This $700 experience isn't very pleasing. You don't get what you pay for at all."
1,Think I got the wrong lens,"Hello Amazon,Now that I have taken some pictures and compared them to my 18-55 USM lens that came as ""standard"" with my Canon EOS Rebel XTI, I see NO advantage or difference. I'm comparing by taking a picture, changing lenses, taking the same picture with the new ""Ultra Wide Angle"" USM lens that cost almost as much as my whole camera/lens/lens package, and see NO DIFFERENCE. Is this the wrong lens? The instruction manual makes no reference to ""Ultra Wide Angle"" anywhere. Please advise. Thank you. William"
3,Not for use with Built in Flash,This is a great lens if you do not plan to use it with a built-in flash. I actually returned this lens because it casts a large shadow when used with the built in flash. If you don't use flash or have an external flash you will love this lens - especially if you miss the full-frame in your canon digital...
2,Not good for Canon Digital SLRs,This lens is really not meant for Canon Digital SLRs. The multiplying factor negates its wide angle capabilities.
5,This is my favorite Lens,I like landscape and interior photography and this is definitely my favorite lens of those I own; with the 10D's 1.6 crop factor this lens has a nice equivalent range of 27.2mm - 64mm.I use it all the time and the images are nice and sharp--considerably better than the images I got from the Sigma 14mm.If you're into portraits 64mm (with a 1.6 crop factor) is maybe a bit too short but for landscapes and interiors I would highly recommend this lens. I love it.
5,photographer,"17-40mm is an older style lens, superseded by 16-35 f/2.8, faster, bigger, heavier, bigger filter size and more than twice the price. 17-40 excellent range and size and all my 77mm filters fit, perfectly satisfied with this lens. 17mm or 16mm, just a step back, well worth the difference in price. F/2.8 or 4, if you use a tripod nobody knows the difference. Depth of field difference is barely noticed between 2.8 and 4. Lastly, half the price of the 16-35. If that matters, and if you're in business this does matter."
5,VERY VERY pleased... WOW,"I'll just let the photo's I took do the talking, I took some of my Fender Stratocaster (see most recent photo's)... The lense is amazing, my company is doing product shots now and I bought this lens so conquer the troubles that it might bring... With very little setup I got some tremendous shots... Amazing and the price it fantastic... If you are thinking about it, it's a no brainer... My shots were shot with a Rebel XTI.. and these people sent this item fast... You will be very happy with this lens PERIOD!!! Have no fear, click the buy button..."
1,Very poor lens...save your money,"I am a professional wedding photographer, and have photographed over 100 weddings. I used this lens for a number of those (fortunately sparingly) and have found this lens to produce very soft images 90% of the time. I have used it under all kinds of lighting conditions, and no matter what the conditions, most shots are soft. I see the price is around $800, which is insane. Don't waste your money."
3,mediocre lens for L-glass,"Perhaps it's always true of wide angle lenses (i'm still new to this arena), but this lens seems a little dark, a little sloppy, just not quite good enough. With the exception of a few panoramic lake-front or ocean beach shots, i've seldom been pleased with the results, despite pairing it with my full-frame Canon EOS 5D. In contrast, i love the photos from my not-L-glass Canon 100m macro or my similarly ""inexpensive"" Canon 70-200L f/4.0 (which has amazing color rendition and excellent bokeh). It could all be my fault, but i think this lens just isn't sharp enough (despite its L-glass designation), and the color isn't rich enough. Sure, there's always post-production, but i hope Canon comes out with a better wide angle lens in this price range."
3,"After a year of use: sadly, I have to say ...","I have taken between 3000-4000 photos with this lens (with a 5d2) in all conditions ... and I'm sorry, but the sharpness on this lens is just terrible. My other (non-L) Canon lenses are way sharper than the 17-40 at nearly every aperture.The build quality is fine, colors are vibrant, etc., but the sharpness is very disappointing."
5,Exelente,"Uno de los mejores angulares que he tenido la oportunidad de provar, se los recomiendo, lamentablemente la abertura llega solamente a 4."
5,17 40 ef,"sharp pictures ,have a silent and fast focus .the wheight is accepteble , im using it with a crop sensor ."
4,Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens for Canon SLR...,"Very good lens. Have not had the opportunity to test this lens fully. Bought it for landscape photography, so I would not forget to turn off the IS that my other lenses have."
5,Great general lens for a digital SLR,"If, like me, you are a fan of wide angle shots with their greater sense of depth, and encompassing vision, then you will love this lens.The 1.6X multiplier of my Rebel XT takes away the extreme wide angle capability of this lens, but nevertheless the range is impressive at an effective 27 to 64mm. This makes the lens a very effective general purpose lens, ranging from a great wide angle to slight telephoto. I normally leave this lens on my camera, only swapping it for a telephoto zoom for outdoor/sports shots.The quality is just great - the pictures jump out at you for their color, contrast and sharpness. Even though this lens costs almost as much as the camera body, there is no question that it is worth every penny. If you are thinking of buying the new 30D with a lesser lens, then you might want to consider saving the money on the body and splurging on this lens instead.You won't regret it!"
1,"Another dissapointment from an ""L"" lens :-(","I have purchased several Canon lenses off Amazon, and this is by far the worst yet. I own an Olympus C-7070 and it takes sharper pictures at f2.8 than this lens takes at f12. Canon has some major quality control issues that they need to resolve, because this is not the first time I have had issues with soft lenses from them. The first lens I bought for my Canon 5D was the 24-105mm. When I received it, I had the similar issues with shapness (or lack thereof), so I returned it to Amazon and got another copy. Again, same problem. It took me sending the lens directly to Canon for calibration to get the problem solved, but who wants that kind of hassle?? Come on Canon, get it together, and improve your quality control. I love my 5D, but it should not be this hard to find good lenses from your ""L"" lineup..."
2,overrated,"This is my first L lens. I own a Canon 50 f1/8 and also a 100 f2, bothfixed length lenses. My rating is not so much to say that this is a badlens because it's not. For 600+ dollars it is just extremely average. Iwould recommend looking at aftermarket lenses before buying this one.You could save a lot of money."
5,Klas&#305;nda,Canon K&#305;rm&#305;z&#305; izgi lenslerden en kolay eri&#351;ilebilirler aras&#305;nda ve kalitesini kaybetmeyecek güzel bir lens... FF makina ile ok güzel neticeler ald&#305;m. tavsiye ediyorum
4,Happy but not satisfy,"Received this item on Oct 20, 2012. Immediately went to S. Lake Tahoe for hikes, took 236 pictures with this lens. F8-11, 17mm, 28, and 40, focal length. Results, there were some CA when it was wide opened from 24-17mm, but no big deal. They can be fixed in Adobe.I used to have Sigma 10-20mm F3.5 DC, and it gave me wonderful pictures on Canon 7D. In comparison to this lens, I like the Sigma better for it gave little bit better in saturation, clarity, and sharpness.Since I upgraded to Canon 5DIII, that lens was not compatible, I wish Sigma have FF version of that lens.Overall, I believe 17-40mm F4.0 will be good for ""walk-around"" lens, and it is good buy at the price $729.00I am looking to purchase either 35mm/24mm F1.4. Hopefully, by black Friday, Amazon will have discount on those lenses:=))"
5,Moved me to another level....,"This lens is a must for those looking to shoot at another level. It is FANTASTIC!!! Thank you so much for your prompt delivery of the produce. It arrived in excellent condition, just as promised!"
2,so disappointing....,"It is very unfortunate the one I bought from Adorama renders fuzzy images. Shooting the same scenes, my Nikon D70 kit kens 18-70mm always beat this one. Even worse, Adorama is not willing to replace or return the lens after 14 days, which is very very short."
4,Canon 17-40,"Having planned to move from a crop body to a full frame or a 1.3 crop (if i decide to get a 1DMkIII instead of a 5D) i needed to replace my 17-55mm lens. Given the 17-40 build quality and weather proofing this was really value for money even though it is an f4. I really didn't need to go into a 2.8 for this as I use a couple more lenses if i really need a wider aperture. The picture quality is good and i need to use it a little more to rate this as great, since i'm currently using it with a 40D i may not be seeing the best of it."
4,Hood included,Great lens. I'm writing this review to let others know that a lens hood was included with the one I purchased; something I haven't seen in the product description.
5,fantastic lens,"Even 2 years ago the 17-40 L Canon lens was reserved for professional photographers because of its high price. Now it became available also for amatours. It's an amazing lens. Any picture taken with it its just fantastic. The colors, the sharpness, the quality its just beyond other lenses. ""L"" form canon holds its quality. I highly reccomend this lens for all photographers for whom taking pictures is more than just a hobby. IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH ITS PRICE!!!"
5,Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM,"This is an ultra crisp lens. I have been using it for almost all shots now, with the exception of macros."
1,the logic of this compilation eludes me,"Carole King is great, no doubt - but what's the point of throwing 'Tapestry' and 'Greatest Hits' into one box????? As a result, five songs are featured twice on this set (And 'Smackwater' actually three times...good grief). For an intro to King, get the similarly priced 'A Natural Woman'."
3,Carole King Box set review,"This box set is pretty good if you're a Carol King fan. This album does have some unspectacular songs on it, but it also has a good number of hits. I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys the music of Carole King and to anyone who wants to get to know her music better."
4,Foundation Instruction,"A lot of women turn to Titus 2 for instruction, encouragement and direction on being a mother, wife and woman. Susan Hunt has laid a great foundation of mentoring and mothering.One person at a time, is the heart of Susan and she guides is through the who, how and why spiritual mentoring is so important.I recommend this book to mothers, women in leadership positions and those who have a heart to reach other women for Christ."
3,women's ministry primer,"Spiritual mothering is a good starting point to developing a meaningful women's ministry. The ideas brought forth in this book are very basic. It is too bad that the author did not go into more depth as to how spiritual mothering can be developed in a local congregation. I presented a program on this book to the United Methodist Women's group at my church. The women in my group felt overwhelmed by the title, but later concluded that Spiritual Mothering is a ""heavy"" title assigned to christian fellowship among women. I am not sure Mrs. Hunt had this in mind in writing this book. I recommend this book for women who are new to the christian faith, and for those who are just starting in women's ministry."
5,A timely work,"This is an excellent book for a Womens' Bible study or a general lesson/study. There is currently a great need for such a topic, as church family is often the only family nearby...Marilyn BakerOPC"
1,NO USE AT ALL,"THANK YOU, AMAZON FOR YOUR PROMPT DELIVERY.THE BOOK THOUGH WAS VERY BADLY STRUCTURED AND WRITEN.I WILL BE SENDING IT BACK TO BE SOLD AS USEDI WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU TAKE IT OFF YOUR SHELVES.I HAVE BOUGHT NUMEROUS BOOKS FROM YOU OVER THE YEARS AND THIS ONE MUST RATE THE ALL TIME WORST.YOU ARE DOING YOURSELVES AN INJUSTICE TO SELL SUCH A LOT OF TRASH."
4,Great book!,"I read Coetzee's ""Disgrace"" before I read this and I was instantly hooked on to his style of compassionate and insightful writing.Michael K shows a fresh way of looking at war, peace, love, compassion and the very nature of our existence. Beyond intelligence, logic and conventions - its nature at its pristine form.The last lines of the book are truly outstanding."
3,Perplexing,"This is the first book I've read by the Nobel Prize winning S. African novelist. It was an interesting Kafkaesque novel set in war-ravaged Africa. Michael K. is an aged sexless, hair-lipped simpleton who goes on an inexplicable journey to get his mother to her place of birth to die. It becomes a strange tale of struggle and survival. A forceful and curious book, still not exactly sure what to make of it."
4,A Haunting Novel of S. Africa,"I am a fan of J.M. Coetzee. Of all his books, I found this one the most difficult reading.It is an allegorical tale of a young, somewhat isolated and intellectually slow man who wheels his mother across the South African landscape in the midst of a civil war. This man, Michael K, innocently becomes the victim of a time and circumstance he does not understand and has not participated in molding. Actually, he is a recipient and victim of these circumstances throughout his life.The ending, which deals with his self-sufficiency and gardening, along with his ultimate demise at the hands of the 'system' is beautifully described through the eyes of a physician.The book is both stark and poetic at the same time. I recommend Disgrace: A Novel orIn the Heart of the Country: A Novel if you are new to this author. They are both more accessible than 'The Life and Times of Michael K""."
3,Universal theme,"This is not a book about South Africa or the apartheid system. This is a universal theme. No where in the book is ""race"" or ""colour"" mentioned. We do not know whether Michael K. is Caucasian, African or Asian--all these races and mixtures are present in South Africa. The area around Cape Town has many descendents of slaves brought by the Dutch to the Cape. We cannot tell by his name what group he belongs to. It seems to me that the author has deliberately avoided a racial theme.If we change the ""place"" names to that of North America, Australia or Argentina, the message of the book would be the same. A simpleton person surviving in a hostile environment. (partly of his own making)Good people and evil people populate this book as they do our world."
2,Not the best,"Well J.M. Coetzee attempts to make a statement on the human experience, he did so not through his character but by his simple writing and the lack of plot in the book,and how resilient one must be to read the whole book where NOTHING HAPPENS. The whole book seems to have been written in simple sentences starting with ""K"" and then some meaningless action verb. This book is really hard to read because often times one gets lost in the hard to follow sequences in the story, or one gets lost in the mundane activities that the protagonist partakes in. The book successfully avoided any of the problems in apartheid South Africa and focussed only on a simple man who wanted to grow some pumpkins. The book drags on forever. Only read if you enjoy the three D's; DULL, DUMB, and DRAB. My favorite thing about the book is that you can tell where I fell asleep while reading it because all the pages before I fell asleep are crisp and all the pages after it are wrinkled, I fell asleep on page 59."
4,An important treatise on FREEDOM,"South Africa once delivered one M.K.(Gandhi) who taught the world a thing or two about freedom and now comes the second one, M.(Michael)K, through Coetzee. True freedom is the state where one can assert ""I do not belong to any camp"" and it does not come easy. Freedom also must exclude ""dependence on charity"" and the temptations are not easy to overcome at times. Michael K succeeded in both the aspects and the novel enumerates the price one has to prepare for. A remarkable novel. And the language! After Naipaul it is difficult to name another author with such mastery and such effective use of language!"
5,Great set of Northern Exposure,"For fans or even casual watchers of Northern Exposure, these are two must-see episodes. The series pilot introduces the plot and characters, and ""Cicely"" is, in my humble opinion, the greatest episode of the series. The first episode I ever saw was ""Cicely"", and I loved it. The unique humor I found to be very engaging, and the ensemble cast is terrific. You don't need to be familiar with the show or its characters to appreciate the quality of this extremely witty and very well done portrait of Cicely's colorful past. When the town doctor hits a 108 year old man with his car, and the man spins a tremendous yarn of the town's early development while being treated, the unfolding tale twists and turns with many delightful surprises. For any fan of Northern Exposure, these two episodes are mandatory viewing, and for those new to Northern Exposure, they are an excellent introduction, embodying the wit, intelligence, ambience, and color of the outstanding television series."
3,2DVD`S which are...but one of the best Carpener films EVER!,"Alright,these DVD`s aren`t the best in picture & sound and obiously Dreamscape isn`t one of the best movie ever made,but you can enjoy it if you are willing to do it.But when there is an alright there is of course a but,so:but Assault on Precinct 13 is one of the best Carpenter-movies I`ve ever seen and for Tarantino-fans:you know what written on the shirt of the little preachersons T-shirt?!It`s a realy good movie and look at the price(!),you can`t make a mistake with this order!"
5,Get the 2nd Edition of the this book!,"Hi y'all...The authors have released the second edition of this book titled as ""Managing Gigabytes : Compressing and Indexing Documents and Images"". It is more upto date & also covers image compression rather than the first edition (this book, that is, Text Compression) covering only textual compression. It also has lots of other new info in the second edition. Btw, the second edition is cheaper than the first edition.BTW, this is a tremendous book to have if you are brand new or a pro in compression technology. One of the authors also wrote another book called ""Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools & Techniques with Java Implementations"", which is a really good addition to one's library!"
3,Very Expensive ......,A bit out of date ....However it is still the only book which discussesppm modelling ..
2,Not as Good as it Looks,We had to secure all the leaves onto the vine. They kept falling off. We re-attached the leaves and bent the wired stem down to secure the leaf.
3,if you're budget is low...,"and if you live near a Micheal's craft store, the sell a variety of fake plants, vines, and that sort for cheap. you can get 6ft worth of fake vines for $5 bucks !! :)"
3,Air Filter for my C5 Corvette,"I wanted to go with the OEM AC-Delco air filter for my C5 Corvette but local prices at the auto parts stores were a bit high. The best price I found at Amazon was a bit lower but not what I'd call a bargain. The item arrived in the original packaging but the box was dirty and stained. A section of the pleated filter media was a deformed and folded over as if it got crushed. I fussed around with it for about 10 minutes and was able to get it acceptably back into form. If I had purchased it locally, I would have taken it back. While I would definitely go with the AC-Delco brand filter in the future, I'd go with a different seller."
3,Fun way to learn,"In learning a language, sometimes you just want to step away from the lesson books and the tapes and do something a little different. Why not crossword puzzles?I agree with the other reviewer who felt that the puzzles in this book were a little too organized into ""themes"". It would have been more challenging to have constructed them like ordinary puzzles. In fact, it would have been even better if a variety of word puzzles were included. However, the book is useful for learning vocabulary and the puzzles are small enough that they can be completed fairly quickly.Not perfect, but a helpful tool."
3,not as expected,"The front cover of the book shows a particular kind of crossword puzzle, and that's what I had expected to buy. Those puzzles are fun because you can learn new words and, with increasingly more letters available, even guess a new word. Easy Italian Crossword Puzzles does not use this type.What does the book do? Each word puzzle concentrates on a topic: weather, color, time, animals, etc. The early puzzles give words in English and you need to find the Italian word, or vice versa. Later puzzles give the word in Italian and ask for a synonym in Italian. At the end of the book, you will find answers to all puzzles. The whole book is more of a vocabulary quiz than a puzzle. I was disappointed."
2,All the fun of an exercise book--and not much more,"As noted, the cover is misleading. Each puzzle is about 80% black space. The relatively few words in each puzzle intersect in one or two letters, so that the crossed words provide little help in finding an answer."
5,My Reputation,wonderful movie this move and Barbara Stanwyck is great in this movie if you love B~S you'll love this movie
5,Great Movie!!!,"Barbara Stanwyck, what an amazing actress, George Brent, I feel is a great actor that was one of the greatest leading men and wasnt recognized for his work in my opinion.I put him up there with Clark Gable and Henry Fonda. This is a very good movie and as a classic movie collector I would recommend this movie."
2,Cast deserves better than this soaper!!,"I found this one of the dullest of Stanwyck's movies....... Boring, boring plot so even good direction, acting, and photography can't save it.For a much better Stanwyck soaper, see Eastside Westside!"
5,Best Baby Info Book!,I don't know how I would survive without this book. I keep it right on my coffee table and consult it almost daily as new questions arise with my baby. It is very thorough and it is easy to find what you are looking for. Every new mother needs this book!
5,"Great book, practical advice, easy to find answers!","This is the best book on baby care. It's easy to find things in the index, the book is well-organized and the advice is practical."
3,"Overall, OK, but beware of bias","You'll find lots of short, direct answers to a lot of common parenting and medical questions in this book. However, I was bothered by Dr. Brown's bias when it came to certain topics; she presents her opinions as established fact when at times it isn't.I would still recommmend buying this book, but take some of the advice with a grain of salt. Nothing beats doing research (if you have the time and the topic is important to you!); circumcision and sleeping styles, for example, are very important and personal choices for each family, do what's best for yours!"
1,Biased,"Author Ari Brown, M.D., presents her opinions as if they were commonly accepted wisdom. For example, the book's section on circumcision comes down squarely in favor of the practice when, in reality, there is no consensus medically or culturally. It's bad enough that Brown can't bring herself to present both points of view, but it is unconscionable that she offers hers like they're gospel. There are lots of better new baby books out there -- skip this one."
5,ESSENTIAL for the first time mom,"I don't think I can give enough praise for this book. It is so well written with humor and common sense. As a new mother I skimmed it constantly for answers to my daughter's latest skin issue, bowel movement, eating schedule, etc. I consider myself well-read. I am college educated and have a good head on my shoulders...but there was nothing that fully prepared me for motherhood once I got there at 30. This book was a blessing for both our family and our pediatrician's office who had one less phone call to answer!"
2,Passport Cover,"Not what I expected for the price and the color shipped was wrong. Even though I contacted the seller, have received no response."
2,Shipping rate is more expensive than the item itself,"The passport cover is nylon with the word ""passport"" written as pictured. For some reason, I imagined that the item was leather and that the lettering was in the photo, but not on the item itself. More surprising though was that the shipping charge was $9.75- more than the $8 item itself!! At that price, you might as well invest in the nicest leather case out there. I've learned my lesson to read more carefully when purchasing from Amazon sellers. It would be a fine item for a cheaper overall price."
5,What do you expect... it's a Canon,"Just as the title states. Canon makes the best lenses on the market. The 15mm fisheye is very sharp. It is my primary lens for shooting surfing in the water. For the price, you can't go wrong."
4,Great Lens,"This is a great lens, especially on a crop sensor body, its like a 24mm instead of a 15mm. It does extremely well in low light and is sharp even at f/2.8. I have used this to do filming in an aircraft simulator where lighting conditions are very low and it performs like a champ. I have also used it during a choir performance in a church to get a wide shot of the entire group, with only ambient lighting and it did very well. This is a quality prime piece of glass."
5,Canon FD 15mm fisheye,"Full frame 15mm fisheye lens is totally amazing!180 degree field of view, close focusing to 39cmSome bending , curving , but this is to be expected with a 180 degree field of view, and isan awesome perspective when shot with a low angle."
4,"Fun Lens, but Limited Practicality","The fisheye lens is a lot of fun, and I enjoy using mine. However, I find that the practicality of the lens is minimal. I don't usually want my ""serious"" photographs to have fisheye distortion.I don't tend to like the 1.6x crop on Canon's lower-end digital SLR cameras, but with the fisheye this has an interesting benefit: it's reasonably easy to use the fisheye as a standard wide-angle lens, since most of the distortion is removed by the 1.6x crop. You can still get distortion, but it's a lot easier to compose a shot without it using a 1.6x camera than a full-frame camera.Either way, lots of fun. Buy one for the enjoyment, or even for professional assignments if your work calls for it, but think about if you really want the distortion before getting one of these."
4,Adds some drama,"I am a wedding and portrait photographer. I use the lens for these situations and love it.1. To add some interest to dancefloor shots. I just hold the camera above the crowd and shoot down. The shots are playful and energetic.2. To make a small, boring church look huge. Just shoot inside and watch out to keep your toes out of the shot.and for fun3. To shoot kids and pets with big, cartoony heads.It's a great lens and fun to use."
4,Great lens!!!,I purchased this lens because I love wide angle shots and have always wanted to use a fisheye. The only reason I am giving the lens a 4 star is because as someone else mentioned it is a much older Canon lens and think they should have a new version. The quality of the pictures is wonderful. The built is great except it is older. I think this lens is perfect for someone who loves the fisheye concept but already has a nice selection of various lenses. By no means should this be the first or second lens someone buys as it's amazing yet very limited.
4,Great product!,I live in a small town. We have really hard water. I go through a filter every 3 months! They shipped very fast as well.
5,spoiled,I can not stand to drink water that is not filtered as I can taste the chemicals. I love this filter.
5,PUR filters are great!,These filters are great.....lots cheaper than purchasing them at a local discount store! Thanks!
5,great price on great product,better price than store and quick service on great product. what more can you ask.
2,Not as good as the original,"I installed one of these in the filter, but the light on the filter is still showing red from the original filter. I'm going to have to call the company and see if this is supposed to automatically reset or if it has to be reset manually somehow.The filter leaks water out of the cheaply made adapters, so I'm not thrilled with its overall performance. I would NOT recommend this filter or these replacements, but I'm stuck with it/them now."
1,No longer last but 1 month.,"After using these filters for over 4 years, the last two batches I rec'd are only lasting 1 month. Don't know what has changed about them, but I use to have them last 3 months. Am very disapointed with these new filters. Guess I will have to look elsewhere for another type of filter.PUR MineralClear Faucet Refill RF-9999, 6 Pack"
5,Love Pur!,Ever since we purchased the Pur faucet mount filter system that has the press to release feature we couldn't be more satisfied. We had tried another brand but it was always leaking and Pur has really helped us to decide to never go back to that brand again.These replacement filters are just so easy to change out and last pretty long in my opinion that they are well worth the peace of mind of this small investment.
1,Don't Buy This Product,"These filters only lasted for about 3 WEEKs each, as opposed to the advertised 3 MONTHs. I contacted PUR but their only comment was an offer to send a coupon for 1 free filter. No help."
5,Amazing deal!,"Buying the six pack is well worth the price. It averages out to $8 a filer where in the local stores, you'll pay around $18 for one. I just changed the filter on my sink faucet and it was fast and simple to do. I love this filter and it really helps to keep my humidifier water clean...and my cats are happy as well drinking fresh water!"
5,"Fantastic filters, but faucet mounts leave something to be desired","I'm a big fan of these filters. I live in an agricultural town that uses well water with questionable quality: high mineral content, sulphur odor, and the possibility of agricultural pollution. These filters made a drastic difference in the clarity and taste of the water.Is agricultural waste really contaminating my water and does this this filter remove it? I haven't had the water tested, thus I don't know for sure. There are also mixed opinions about town as to whether bad water is a problem. However, letting my taste buds judge, I'll guess this makes a difference in removing pollutants that I can and cannot taste. These are relatively low-cost filters when purchasing in bulk.The faucet mount for these filters is a different matter altogether, and I think it is a shame they are not built to the same quality standards as the filters they hold."
5,purchase directly from Amazon to save,"Admittedly I don't drink a lot of tap water, but this 6-pack of Pur replacement filters has lasted me a full 17 months. They're pretty easy to install and once they're in you'll know that they work by the green LED light that flashes (once they need replacing the light turns red). I purchase directly fromAmazonas their price is the very lowest I have seen (online and in stores). These are made by Proctor & Gamble (who warrants this product for a year) and work with both the standard Pur faucet mounts as well as the Pur flavor sensations faucet attachments."
3,Not quite sure about these filters,"I'm not sure if I received a bad batch, but when I first installed this filter and turned on the faucet, I immediately was disgusted by how slimey my hands felt. Just to make sure it wasn't just me...I had my boyfriend run his fingers through the filtered water and he felt the same thing. We ran the water for an hour (waste), and it was slightly less slimey. The taste is a bit different than the pur filters I've used previously, but this may be attributed to the mineral bed. We've been using the water for over two weeks, but just for coffee and filling up the dog's water (which they surprisingly like). I'm hoping I'll get used to the taste. Is this normal????"
3,Decent filter but questions remain...,"I have been using PUR filters for a while and when I found this product I switch, reasoning that it would provide a higher level of filtration. However, I am not certain what it does exactly in terms of heavy metals in the water...Company stipulates that it REDUCES heavy metals, however by how much is unknown...Has anyone tested the water filtrated by the PUR?"
3,"works, but not as good as...","A friend recently purchased a ""ZeroWater"" water filter that comes with a device you can insert into the water to determine what they refer to as ""detectable dissolved solids."" Water filtered through her ZeroWater filter came up with a reading of 000 (as it should). My Pur-filtered water was in the upper 90s and not that much better than the measure of my unfiltered water. That being said, there could be other things being filtered besides ""detectable dissolved solids"" which are more critical, so I really don't want to make a scientific judgment, just put the comparison out there for your consideration."
5,Pur RF 9999 Faucet refillls,Cannot beat the price when ordering these items in bulk from Amazon. Free shipping also. Will always use this company for ordering my refills.
5,clean water,These filters provide clean and fresh tasting water.It removes the chlorine taste and smell and makes the water drinkable and makes it crystal clear.
3,PUR faucet filter refills are OK,"I like the PUR set up but the filters seem to last a shorter number of uses than they use to, and of course the price is higher than it use to be as well."
4,Good 3-stage filters,"As the title suggests, these are good 3-stage filters. We've been using these types of water filters for a couple years now and have had absolutely not trouble with them at all. They appear to be doing exactly what they are supposed to do - clean the water for drinking. On occasion these filters seem to come to a crawl when filling up our coffee pot, but usually it goes back to a normal flow the next time around. Kind of weird, but I guess that goes with the territory. Overall, good filter and good price from Amazon, and as always, fast shipping."
5,HAPPY FOR SEVERAL YEARS WITH PUR FILTERS,"I have had a PUR faucet filter for several years - only reason I had to replace the unit was because I broke it when trying to remove the filter - the newer ones are ""cheaper"" but they do seem easier to get open to replace filter! I have not had any problems with replacement filters. They do not last too long - maybe 1-2 months and I only use for drinking water and coffee water - however, the water here in our town in Oklahoma is TERRIBLE!! It is not drinkable unless filtered and we always get reports on all the crap that is in our water, so I don't expect it to last as long. And it must be working, as when I change the filter it is very heavy compared to new one! At less than $10 per filter, it's still waaaay cheaper and better on the environment than buying all that bottled water!"
4,great,works great. Make Florida water palatable. Prices vary wildly-almost 3 times as much at the grocery store. Amazon is best price.
5,Pur 6 pack,This is a very good value! These are the same filters that I can buy at my local store at a price of $20.00 for 1 filter. The stores do not carry more than a 2 pack at $35.00. So for me this is the only way to buy my filters!
4,MUCH CHEAPER AS A 6 PACK,I've been using this pur filtering system for years. It's much cheaper to buy this 6 pack. Saves me about 20% and I don't even have to leave the house. Doesn't get any better than that. Once again we went from American made to made in mexico. My only question is if they are getting all of our old jobs why do they keep coming over here?
5,5 stars,"Speedy and efficient delivery. Great product, works as advertised. Have ordered many times before always the same results...excellent! Will be ordering again until the life of my filter expires whenever that may be."
4,takes the chlorine smell out of the water,"The filters have reliably been taking the chlorine smell out of the water. However, they do not last as long as advertised before the ""need to replace filter light"" turns solid red."
1,Never Purchase PUR,I will never purchase another PUR Product EVER. Their not helpful at all and think there product is perfect which I found was not. It never showed it needed to be changed an I ended up having loads of mold in it when I did take it off to change. Made my stomach turn over. I will never forget that day.
3,Great deal!,Amazon is the best! I love this website! OK now that being said this was a great deal to me one that I couldn't pass up. The order came on time which is amazing in itself. The water is so clean. My only problem is that it doesn't last 2-3 mos. Mines only last 3weeks and my daughter and I most of the time don't even use it.If it wasn't for the company telling that huge lie I would have giving it a 5star. Hopfully the company will work on this.
1,SHAKE FILTER....PLEASE READ!,"I gave this a one star hoping most will read negative reviews! I don't have a problem with this system other than I feel it's a bit flimsy.Filters will last an unbelievably long time if when light turns yellow you remove and shake it. Like a spray paint can. You'll hear the contents shaking. Do this EVERY TIME the light turns yellow. Reinstall, green light. When water flow is restricted it's time to replace.Replacement filters are the major cost of this system. This will cut this down significantly."
1,Pur filter,The filter unit which this replasement filter is intended was discontinued by manufacturer prior to my order.Amazon still carried the replacement filter. I ordered 2.Meanwhile the unit on my faucet broke and became useless. I could not order a replacement unit to use the new filters. The filters arrived and had to be thrown away.I won't buy another PUR product.
4,Refill cartridge,Haven't used them yet but are exactly like the one that is in my pur faucet water filter. Were a lot cheaper than buying them in a store.
2,PUR filters,"These filters are susposed to last for 90 days. However, they last seventeen (17) days at best. The flow of the water from the filter starts to slow down until it becomes a trickle. At that point, the filter must be replaced with a new one. This becomes very expensive. At this rate it is cheaper to buy bottled water on sale."
1,Life is too short!,"These water filters are expensive and only last about 2 weeks, I am on my second one since 8/17/08? Certainly for $12.00 I had hoped to get a month out of it? I do not run through filters when washing dishes either!"
5,"Great buy, great service, no problems!!",I loved it. Great price and it arrived on time. I would recommend it to others! I saved money buying the 6pack and now won't have to worry about my water problems for awhile. Will purchase more when I finish using these.
3,weak stream,Sometimes the water pressure does not get enough pressure to send out a stream. Filter fills quickly with impurities. Glad I have it though!
1,NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THE QUALITY!,The first filter stopped working in about a week. Hopefully the 2nd one will do better. Never had a problem with PUR filters in the past.
4,PUR,"What do you say about a water filter? Where I live, you wouldn't dare drink the water without the filter. I'm glad to have it, and find that it does work better when hooked on the faucet, than using the pitcher filter system."
4,"Buy in bulk, not 1 at a time","I needed a refill for my Pur faucet filter and was dismayed by how expensive they were for 1 at the store. They were almost as expensive to buy 1 online as well.I went with the 6 pick at less than the cost of 2 individual filters would have cost if I had purchased them online. My girlfriend has the same filter, so I gave her 3 of the filters.It takes a while to go through 6 filters so it would be best if you could find another person with the same filter and split the cost and filters."
5,Excellent,Very good: delivery on time. 100% efficient to eliminate chlorine flavour to our tap water! Every refill last around 2 months. Good for the price we paid.
4,PUR filters 6 pack,This is a good buy on this product. Buying in quantity is the only way to go because of the high cost of buying individually.
1,I received a bad batch,"This was the third pack of six I'd purchased over a few years. I installed one of the filters and noticed that its initial flow rate seemed much higher than the initial flow rate of previous filters I'd installed, and the water had a different taste. So I tossed the filter and installed a second one. Same high flow rate. Then I measured it's actual flow rate, which turned out to be 445 grams in 10 seconds. For comparison, I measured the 10 second flow rate of my faucet without the filter -- 914 grams. So the filtering was doing some filtering, but still it seemed too fast. So today I bought a 3-pack of the same filters (RF-9999) at Walmart, installed one of them, and immediately noticed that its initial flow rate seemed much more normal to me. I measured its 10 second flow rate at 301 grams. So yes, I definitely received a bad batch. Unfortunately, it's too late to return it."
5,Great product,"I have been using Pur Water filters for more than a year now, and it indeed make a difference.Amazon's service is excellent, delivery in time, price is right."
3,so much hype,"these filters cost a lot so they should last and work for say three months instead of two to three weeks, the water pressure after say a week and a half starts to slow down and it does not come out straight i""m very dissapointed with these filters i""m not rich i cannot afford to keep buying these filters every 2 or 3 wks"
4,"PUR Mineralclear 3-Stage Replacement Filter Refill, RF-9999","The refills were reasonably priced and fit my filtration system. The packaging was flimsy. The filters were new (in their package), but just put in a baggie in a bubble envelope. The contents came through the mail fine, but a more sturdy mailing method would make me feel more comfortable about ordering them again."
2,"Good Filter, Bad Device","I bought this six pack almost 2 years ago. I haven't been able to get through it because the attachment keeps failing. I've gone through three since I bought this.I'm dying to get through these so I can buy a completely different type of water filter. But my third attachment, less than 6 months old, has sprung 4 leaks.Updated 05/31/2012: The newest faucet attachment pops on and off, so you only have to put it on when needed. It's been almost a year and no leaks. This seems to have solved the issue of wear and tear which leads to the leaks. Why couldn't they have thought of that years ago? Now we'll see what the longevity of the part that ""pops"" on and off is."
2,Defective filter,"So far, the first filter in the 6-pack I received was defective - it only allowed water to flow for 2 to 3 minutes, then stopped working. I've been using these filters for a few years, and this is the first time this has happened.The second filter was fine, but given how expensive these are, I'm going to ask PUR to replace the first one."
4,too short a life,"Excellent quality, but I find that the amount of water in gallons that is filtered is too small. Your other filters offer more amount of water."
4,Pretty good for the price.,"Where I live the tap water kinda sucks. Lots of chemicals added to it and such. Tastes like taking a drink from your swimming pool.Went to Pura awhile back and it works pretty good for the money.WARNING if you run any hot water through the filter it will toast it. And they arn't cheap. So if you can get a deal for a 6 pack like this, it's well worth the money.Other than that, I love it. Cleans up the water, tastes.. well.. like water should.. assuming water is supposed to have a taste. ;)You really can't go wrong with this. It's allot cheaper than buying tons of bottles water, and alot better on the enviroment. Not all those plastic bottles going into land fills."
5,I like it!,"We have been using this filter system for 2 years. The filters signal when it is time to change them but, we usually get another month or two of use after the signal ends."
4,Pur H2O,Am happy with the Pur filters but my onlycomplaint is that it does not get Fluorideout of the water and is a chemical that I do not wantto drink.
4,Cant beat this deal,"This is the best deal that I found for these water filters. It might be more expensive than buying a 2 pack, but it is a way better value, its less than 10 buck per filter. And in my home they should last at least half a year. And I'm sure just like everyone else it is really handy to have a sink mounted filter."
3,Good product for the price.,"I purchased a PUR faucet filter from Target and enjoy the taste of the water. The filters that I bought on Amazon do a great job, but I was somewhat disappointed in how long they lasted. The first one lasted just over 90 days, which to me, is far too short. I use it every single day, and it's more convenient than having a jug filter for the fridge. So it is what it is. Good filter, ok longevity."
5,Throw away your Britta,"This is an excellent price for a superior quality filter. Throw away your Britta and/or stop buying water at the grocery store. Because this 3 stage filter filters out many more bad things. Your water will not just taste better, but it will be better for you."
5,Great filter lasts 2-3 months,Great filter lasts 2-3 months for us. We have been using it for past few years (along with 2 stage earlier) and we have no complaints. PUR customer service is good too. They will give you coupon if anything goes wrong with your product.
3,it ok,"for some reason, even right after changing the filter, the light still remains red. It is supposed to turn back to green after a new filter is put in, but not in this case."
1,Lickage,Not worth to spend money on PUR FAUCET. I am switching to Brita as it is more effective and cheaper. Faucet is giving hard time with lickage and which creates lot of rust on bottom of faucet. Costco is cheaper place to buy this product.
1,False advertising at its best!,"Purchased filter system FM9400B and Filters RF9999 In June. Advertised at 100 Gallons!!!!! Well, trust it from someone whom tracked evey filter/gallon, not even close. I am a pro athlete who is required to track daily water intake which Is why I purchased system. Well after carefull documenting each gallon and days used the news is really disappointing for consumers whom dont track its production or lack of. Average is 60 gallons and turns yellow in less than 30 days. Bottom line is this product does not produce as advertised. Dont waste your money!!!!! FYI I contacted Kaz 1800-332-1110 whom handles Pur line and they do not back this product in any way, shape or form. Lots of exscuses no real answers."
5,Fantastic Price,Always bought through the store and you get 2 in a pack. But this offer of 6 you can not beat. The you get free shipping and you can not beat the price. It cuts the price in half. Our water in Florida is drinkable but has a not so pleasant taste. With these filters it gets rid of all the bad stuff.
5,Great price for a great product,"I have been using this water purifier for a little more than a year and to be able to get the refills for 60% less than Walmart prices, that is worth it"
3,I bought PUR,"Filter works fine enough I guess. But people who say it only last about 2 weeks are telling the truth. I was not happy with how fast it blinked yellow and then red. I expected like 4 times as long. I had a different type of filter, I cant remember the name, but it lasted like 4 - 6 months. It was the type that had a white line that slowly turned black. I'm gonna be going back to it. So If you got a lot of money this is great for you because it only last a couple of weeks."
4,Good filters,I bought these filters for use in our boat. We have a 30 gallon water tank and rely on these filters for our drinking water.
4,don't think about it until I have to replace it,"I have the Pur Flavor Options faucet mount hooked up in my kitchen and I really enjoy it. Truthfully, I don't see much of a difference. My tap water always tastes very good. And I usually do not drink sink water simply because I have a KitchenAid filter hooked up to my fridge. But I know that Pur is something that will benefit even if I can't taste it or see it. It's just a little added bonus that I use when I boil water because I know my family can't tell that I'm doing it but like I said it will benefit them. My main complaint is that these do not last very long. I generally have to replace them within 6 weeks of installing them. That wouldn't be so bad, except these filters are a pain to find in the store. So I just order them online."
5,satisfaction...,The poroduct does what it is supposed to do and the company did what they said they would do. What more could a consumer ask for ???
4,just the way it was supposed to be,"price for these filters was right -- much better than home depot, and the quality is as it should be. oh, delivery was very prompt."
4,PÜR filter sent fast!,"Sent within 2. Days, just before all my family showed for a visit. Perfect timing. Will order in future w/ the senders."
4,Pur water filter,This is the best price I've found except at Sam's Club which haven't offered this six pack in several months.These filters really take the bad tasting water and make it free from odors and bad taste.I have used these filters for several years and they have always worked to make my water great tasting.A six pack will last me for a year .
5,stinky water,"The Pur filter replacements I purchased through Amazon were a wonderful deal. I live in Florida with ""stinky"" water and have to use a filter for my drinking water. Thanks AMAZON!!!! People on a fixed income appreciate it!"
3,pur 3 stage water mount filter,The filters do not produce the rated 100 gallons of water before they run slow. I think that the water pressure is too low in my home.
2,Newer But Not Better,I've used Pur water filtration systems for years. I've always been satisfied with the taste and quality of the water until I tried the new filter. The one that is suppose to leave the taste of minerals the water. I now know that I hate the taste of minerals. After using the stage 3 filters for so long the new filters make the water taste like something horrible has been added to the water. I will try to find and buy some of the older filters before they get phased out. I will only need six or so because the quality of the water is so bad with the new filter it will not be on the shelves for very long. And if it does not change back then I will have to shop around for another water filtration system.
2,"Overstated filter life, useless customer service","Pur Stage Three filters do improve the taste of my water. I don't know if they are actually saving me from all the bad things they are claiming to save me from. I'd need a lab analysis for that. Sadly, the good news about the water ends with its good taste.As other reviewers have pointed out, Pur largely overstates the longevity of its filters. I get no where near 100 gallons; maybe about half of that. Also, the ""indicator"" window is totally useless. My output can be reduced to a trickle for weeks and the red lever never moves beyond about a third of the window. Lastly, don't let Pur's friendly ""we're here to help"" 800 number fool you. It's a telephone tree where all branches lead to the same destination: a dead end recording that suggests you buy another filter."
3,I Hope the PUR works as Designed...Water with a different taste than GA Tap Water!,"The Water tastes nicer than the Tap water in GA...Or Atleast I can taste water! I hope the specs on the product are as designed/stated, but I have no reason to believe otherwise."
2,Purdisappointed,"Purchased this in April 2012. The first filter performed well. Had a hard time getting the 2nd filter to indicate green, but finally worked. Purchased the 6 pack of replacement filters and have only been able to get one to indicate green after replacement. The rest all indicate red. Not cost effective with the trial and error of replacement filters!"
2,lack of forsite,although the filters eliminate the cost of buying bottled water and disposing of the plastic they come in the filters themselves are not re-cycleble and they don't last as long as projected. they are easy to use and provide cleaner water
3,Easy to install but expensive!,"I bought this product and I had to again purchase the filters on Amazon (as Wal-mart did not have stock) after two weeks. That means I had to change the refills once every two weeks. There are only three ppl in this house (apouse, baby and myself). I usually use the filtered water to drink and boil water for my baby. I feel that it is expensive as i noted that ive to change it twice a month. :("
3,Lasts maybe a month - of moderate use,"Seattle city water is tested to be pretty clean. I don't get sediment in the faucet traps like I used to previous places I lived - but these things still are toast in a month. We're also not super heavy water drinkers. It gets steady, moderate use. They're the shortest lived filters I've yet used. They're also not cheap.The redeeming quality - the water tastes great - like bottled water great - and supposedly these do an uncommonly good job at filtering crap out. I just wish they either lasted longer or cost less."
4,Good Quantity Package,"This is the first time I've seen Pur refills sold in more than 2 or 3 to a package. The six pack is definitely a very good idea especially because the longevity of use has been shortened since the product was changed. Your price is also very good. The older version of refills lasted about three times longer than the new version. I would imagine that the amount of water filtered until the light goes to red is less than 8 gallons now,PUR MineralClear Faucet Refill RF-9999, 6 Packand am curious to know why, plus how long it can be used once the light turns red."
2,Clean water,"Recently i bought from that site a package of six pur water filters.I have a water tester and it shows that water running through filter has more components (214)that without filter(200).Bottled water shows only (20).The water runs faster through filter than though faucet,it means water is not filtrated.I'm going to returned that product."
3,Good Product. Vendor a little on the expensive side.,"Good product., Vendor price was a little expensive and charged too much for shipping. Overall Good"
1,Good product - Very short life,"This product is good in the sense that it works fine for the first few days. Then, water flow thins down and it becomes hard stop in 2 weeks. It is very misleading to advertize that it lasts for 2-3 months or 100 gallons. Dude!! Use and test it before you sell or advertize. The filter is good for about 2 weeks. This is far expensive than good old trusted bottled water. Don't buy this unless you are stinking rich and are comfortable with false advertisements."
4,"Cleaner, Fresher Water",I found it easy to install after figuring out the best way to align the notch. A filter lasts me about 5-6 weeks and I like having the flashing led to let water initially run thru the filter.
5,Like the 6 pack,I am happy with my pur Mineralclear I didnt save much on them but they where delivered to my door and they came in a six pack .I have only seen a 3 pack in stores.
4,could be better,should last longer it gets used very quickly it is the system I have so no choice in this product
1,Pull The Plug On This One,"I obtained this set for Christmas which I added to my existing AC/DC DVD collection. This piece of work is the worst of the lot. The sound lacks 5.1 and DTS, plus the picture quality for the most part is equally as bad as the sound.Save your precious dollars and steer clear from this dud. ""Live at Donington"" is what you should be looking at getting.Shame on the boys from down under. They pulled a fast one on their audience.BTW, thank God that I didn't get the 3 disc set."
1,No Closed Caption or Subtitle in English??,No closed caption or subtitle in English for the deaf and hard of hearing viewers???? What's up with that??
5,For AC/DC fans,"Make sure you get the 3cd edition. For the occasional AC/DC fan that should be enough. However for the hardcore fan this might not be enough. There are lots more great material out there, so AC/DCology 1, #2,#3...Bring it on......."
5,AC/DC Fans Only,"I'll keep this short. If you dig Family Jewels, you'll love this as a live addendum. If you don't get that last sentence, avoid this DVD set and go for AC/DC ""No Bull"" live, which is definitely the best w/ Brian show ever recorded and released. Gotta go, my Kilkenny is getting warm."
4,AC DC DVD Plug Me In,"Good dvd (set of 2) for the price and free shipping. Delivered on time. Enjoyed watching AC DC from the early days with Bon Scott, and also Brian Johnson with more current concert footage. If you like AC DC, you like this DVD."
2,"4 Stars for Content, 1 Star for Sound","I can NOT believe, in this day and age, that they could release such a DVD set and not even provide Dolby Digital sound. Let alone DTS or 5.1, there is simply NO excuse. Cheap, cheap cheap. To top it off, there is a Dolby Digital logo on the back of the box. What was that, to fool the consumer??? I've rarely felt so gyped in my life. PATHETIC.The content on the DVD is nice to have, the video quality of some of it is poor, like it was filmed on someone's old Super 8 camera. Some of the video is pretty good quality, but nowhere NEAR up to snuff by today's standards, and yes, I know that a lot of the footage is old, but so is the Led Zeppelin DVD and the Kids are Alright, and gee, they didn't seem to have a problem there. There is SIMPLY NO EXCUSE. That shows you what happens when you file reviews, as the 3 before me did, BEFORE the release of the product. I wish I could return mine, but since I can't, it's getting sold. I'll stick with my Donnington DVD."
3,AC/DC's Plug me in gets unplugged very quickly!,"First off..AC/DC should have a statue of them somewhere in the world of Rock'n Roll, that's how great they are! having that said, this box set is really in my opinion crap that was lying on the floor and was unused for different reasons. Yes there's some few cool stuff in it, posters, pictures, etc... but that's all stuff you could get on the net if you look in the right places. Main reason why I bought this, I collect everything from them. Listened to it once, put it back on my collectors shelve and wait that someday it will be worth something. Great piece of collection to own, but the content is less than satisfactory due to the fact that i pretty much know everything about them. A great gift for their new fan's."
1,Not worth it.,"A rehash of previous stuff, some unreleased ""offically"" live stuff that the quality really sucks on. For 60 dollars they should have properly remastered it."
3,AC/DC circa 1979?,"I have to say, this was a major disappointment. Let's put aside the fact that you cannot get any AC/DC in digital format like Itunes, napster, etc so we have to buy the stuff in the store. So no Dolby?What about the fact that I cannot play the darn thing in my computer's DVD player!!!!! Is there some type of cripple on it to prevent this?IS anyone else having problems?Oh well the videos were cool"
2,"5 Stars for Content, 1 Star for Sound","I can NOT believe, in this day and age, that they could release such a DVD set and not even provide Dolby Digital sound.

5,Awesome!!!,"Warning, this is for hardcore AC/DC Fans. If you are a casual fan, you probably won't like it. It shows some vintage footage that doesn't have best sound or film quality. However, that is the beauty of it. They didn't have the high def or surround sound that we are use to now. It is like opening a time capsule on the greatest hard rock band ever."
5,Great for the AC/DC lover,"This is a great collection to add to your AC/DC stash! So much great footage, good quality and totally worth it if you're a big fan!"
1,Very unhappy customer,"I was extremely disappointed. It was a Christmas gift to my mother. It arrived and it was not working. Thinking that maybe it just needed a new battery it was taken to a jewelry shop to have the battery replaced where it was discovered that a spring was broken. I figured no biggie just send it back but unfortunately their return requirements were absolutely ridiculous. I feel certain its made the way it is so that it is virtually impossible to meet all of the criteria for returning this product and having it replaced. I am extremely disappointed and can only hope that when I get it to a watch repair shop that it wont cost as much as the watch itself to fix. I wish it had been sold directly by Amazon, at least then I couldve replaced or simply returned and purchased another watch instead."
4,Great Long While worth the long wait.,"I picked up my copy at their ""release party"" concert in New Haven, VT. Note: included in the CD are 6 MP3's of songs that would not fit on the CD.Mud Spring Draw 1 + 2, See too, Sweet L, Stepin 1 and 2. Download with a PC computer.(This is not mentioned on the packaging) Great Band and CD. A couple of songs are a little different sounding studio, than live; added a little enhancement to the voices, added horn and keyboard. Recomend you buy it. Only thing I do not understand is the ""title track great long while"" did not make the CD or MP3. I hope it is released as a B side."
3,Not worth buying it,"In spite of its educational value, it is not worth buying this game. Way too expensive just for a deck for cards."
5,At the top of their form.,"This l989 reunion album shows why the Airplane was the Airplane. Here you've got five virtuoso musicians, all except Jack Casady also being virtuoso songwriters. Unlike other rock reunion CDs, these guys don't fall back on rehashing their old hits. No White Rabbit here. Instead, Gracie gives us Freedom; the diva is at the top of her form, and Jorma's flamenco-tinged rock lead showcases the master in action. Kantner and Balin wrote Madelaine Street together, after not having written together for eons. It's brilliant. So is the whole album. (Beware of a same-titled CD, tho, that is not their '89 reunion album). Especially outstanding: Paul's Planes, and Marty's Summer of Love."
5,Product Description,"When top scientist Carl Wiseman announces that a gigantic asteroid hurtling towards Earth will miss completely, Stegz is suspicious - his calculations say it's going to sideswipe the Earth, causing terrible damage! The Dinosaurs are right to be suspicious: the Raptors forced Wiseman to lie and then kidnapped him to keep him from warning anyone. They think the asteroid impact will push the Earth closer to the sun, making it a lot warmer.....too warm for humans, but just right for Raptors! The Extreme Dinosaurs must rescue Wiseman from the Raptors, and find a way to stop the asteroid before it's too late."
4,Transfers Celtic knots onto fabric art,"The author has taken the traditional Celtic knot, and combined the angular lines with fabric bias strips, to create a new art form. The technique creates frames and borders that are elegant. Quilters will enjoy the ease and speed with which these go together, and Celtic artists may also be inspired. I even put them on sweatshirts and pillows!"
4,A little different but better than original.,The replacement knives are the FLIGHT pattern but the butt of the knife is not as rounded. The good news is that the replacement design is all one solid piece and should not come apart as did the originals. I am ordering 6 more.
2,"I have used it twice, and both times were a pain","First time I used it, the light bulb slipped out the side and smashed down my wooden stairwell.Second time, a year later, the spring got hung up in the bulb while putting in a new bulb, I had to fight to get it back out, by then the spring was ruined. I replaced it with a rubber band and I was able to get the light bulb in."
1,Terrible design for using with recessed can-type floods,Terrible design for using with recessed can-type floods. The spring attaching arms are installed on the outside of the spring with the hooks to hold the spring in in place on the outside of the spring. When attempting to use the flood light r/r tool with a recessed can the can usually has a trim ring held in place by springs. The tool then gets caught on the can springs and is almost impossible to remove without damaging the can springs/trim ring and or breaking the light bulb.I took another reviewers advice and removed the spring arms and turned them around so they are now on the inside of removal spring and it works. 1-1/2 hours to do correctly. No reason the mfg. couldn't have built this way to begin with.Do not buy unless you are mechanically inclined!
1,Shoddy design,I purchased this product at Lowe's and it broke less than 10 minutes after I started using it. The spring-loaded ring around the top of the gripper came apart immediately. Not recommended.
1,wont work for me,Bought the Product thinking it would be helpful in not breaking bulbs while removing them but there is a greater chance of breakage because you have push this spring loaded grabber on and off the bulb which I also dont think would be good on old sockets... however the suction cup attachment does look like it would be helpful in putting in the flat style bulbs.
1,JUNK,"This is total JUNK - don't buy it. The suction cup won't stick to bulbs - I have had three bulbs slip off and crash to the floor. The manufacturer will only replace the crappy suction cup and not the bulbs, so I'm out about $6 each for 3 CFLs. Get a ladder or some other product."
2,Very limited applications,"This product has severe limitations. The large basket is pretty useless for anything but floodlights and the small basket is too small for standard or CFL bulbs, so this product works poorly on most common bulbs. The large basket grips poorly on bulbs and CFLs, and it is so large and shallow that it's a balancing act to get the bulb to earth withour having it spill out. The pole must be tipped to get the bulb to the ground of course, but the basket is too large to cradle most bulbs."
3,It did the job,"I was able to change the bulb for my flood light outside which is really high but it wasn't easy. The changer didn't grab the bulb well so it took some work. Then screwing the new bulb in, I needed a nap by the end!"
3,GOOD DESIGN BUT NOT TOO STURDY,I purchased this product to change bulbs that obviously I would not reach. I used the product to change perhaps 5 bulbs when it broke. Being Amazon it was easy to get a replacement. The new kit arrived promptly and I am under the impression that this product if used a lot will not hold up that well in time.
1,"Get a ladder, skip the pole","Poorly designed for light bulb removal; an adequate ladder is much better. The torque required to loosen a light bulb is much greater than the torque required to loosen the extension locks. Even if you can grip the bulb, the extended pole will only loosen the locks and recollapse."
3,The hardy boys in 2002/3 review,Wow after reading the books as a kid I finally found a place that sold the video's. If you think the books are corney then get a load of the video's. I was hoping to find a DVD of them but after watching them I can see they will never make it to DVD. 70's kids police type drama. Great for its day probably becasue it was made by Glen A Larsen (the A-team etc)If you loved the books then this is something for the memories but even young kids will pick the video's to pieces.
3,mechanics about how herbal medicines works,about herbal medicines?(any mechanics or any herbal plants
5,This book will put more herbs than food in your fridge!,"As a student of herbal medicine myself, I find this book ismore practical than any on the market. It is written so thateven my cat can understand it, and oh... the information isvery up-to-date, something us both future and already herbalistshave a hard time finding. I even have caught my boyfriend readingit. So if your looking for a book that will help you discoverhow to make your fridge fuller than what it really is, this isit!"
3,OK,"Love Bloom, but weak movie. Would not recommend to watch unless you are in need of spacing out for an hour and change."
3,Some good actors but the story line was weak,The story started out interesting but didn't really go anywhere. I also didn't like Colin Firth portraying a Texan. I missed his accent.
2,Disappointed,"Was drawn to this movie because of the all-star cast, but the story line and lack of integration between the characters, not to mention the extremely slow pace of the dialogue, all left me feeling as if the movie was lacking. Only watched the film in its entirety in the hopes that it would get better, but it did not."
2,Still Waiting,"I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never really does. There's not much of a story here, and what little there is you can figure it out after the first 30 minutes. The acting is better than OK, the actors just weren't given much of a story to work with. The feel I kept getting from this movie is that it must be a pilot-movie for a TV show because it's so slow developing, as if there were to be more episodes to continue the story. There's never a build up to a climatic point, the viewer is left waiting."
2,Glad I didn't pay for this!,"What a lackluster film! With such a great cast I fully expected Main Street to deliver something interesting, but the implausible plot, terrible script and mundane directing and camera work certainly overwhelmed any possibility that these normally fine actors could deliver anything except something bland and uncooked. It was one of those films where you keep expecting something to happen - and it never really does. Don't be sucked in by any sense of mystery in the description - it's only mysterious how this film got made and why these actors agreed to be part of the project."
3,hullo? Bill Clinton there?,"I have been a Firth fan for years. His part as Jim Whitaker in Easy Virtue made the movie for me. In Main Street, every time Firth opened his mouth and spoke--it sounded like he was channeling Bill Clinton--or he sounded like Bill Clinton trying to fake a British accent--I couldn't decide which. Colin Firth's voice was so distracting that I couldn't get into the dialogue or plot or the other characters--so the entire piece didn't work for me. Sorry, Mr. Firth, you should have passed on this one."
4,"Main Street...Durham, NC","Horton Foote wrote this screenplay about the city I call home when it seemed there wasn't going to be any revitalization in Durham. Some local viewers of the movie have not been happy about the way our city was portrayed. It's a bittersweet movie about a city's downtown area that has seen better days and the people who are affected by the downturn. Give ""Main Street"" a chance...Orlando Bloom and Colin Firth do pretty decent southern accents!Durham is now a beautiful, revitalized city that supports the arts, history, diversity and many other great things."
2,Skip it,That is an hour and a half of my life I will never get back! Great actors wasted on a movie that has plenty of loose ends.
3,Great actors but bad storyline,"Just OK to watch but nothing more. Will soon be forgotten by me as the story didn't engage me as I found the manuscript to be boring. Just easy-going, no big drama or excitement, very likable cast of characters, it is all very nice and ordinary but it is missing some kind of tension to make it interesting. So many great actors so this is really very sad. I was expecting more."
1,A movie in which nothing happens,"Such a waste of a wonderful group of actors. But, then again their performances were weak at best. I think the director tried to set the tone of a small southern town, by making the movie slow and the acting slow, but then nothing happened in the end. Being from the area, all of the ""yes ma'am""s and bad accents were embarassing."
2,A movie for what?,I think that there is a lot of money in the world to make movies. But they could be better...
4,Nobody gets shot; nothing blows up.,"...and I know that bores some of you to tears. You just can't sit back and watch ""a slice of life"". Several characters, interracting with each other, no real SUPER-intense moments. Yes, you are left wondering how it ends; who stays with each other and who doesn't? First time a movie did that to you? GET OVER IT!!! Fine cast, and worthy of ninety minutes of your life."
3,Ho-Hum,"As I understand it, this movie was based on a script that was designed to be a play, and it might have worked well as a play. However, when you try to turn a play into a movie, it can seem very disjointed, and this is what happened here. In addition, WAY too much time was spent on the random musings and reflections of the old lady.Finally, the plot of the movie involves a company wanting to store hazardous waste in an abandoned warehouse in North Carolina that had previously stored tobacco for decades. People are upset about the hazardous waste. No one seems to make the connection that the hazardous waste is replacing tobacco!!!!! How much more hazardous can that be? I thought to movie would eventually get around to pointing out that both are hazardous, and then making social comment about which is the worse of the two evils. But that never happened."
2,"wanted to like this movie, but","wow, great casthorrible scriptactors seemed lost trying to make sense of where to go with the scriptB movie, a shamecolin firth, god love him, great actor, but HORRIBLE southern accent..... geesh!!!and then the ending.... total deus ex-machina... all the sudden all is great and forgiven... PATHETIC...i hate blatant moral tale movies.... it's like the milagro bean field war on steriods.THUMBS DOWN"
1,Main Street,"I absolutely ""love"" Colin Firth, but he must have done this movie for the money. Totally miscast. He did live in the Carolinas at one point in his life but that Texan accent (distracting). The other American and Mexican actors were a good choice. This movie was a sleeper with no excitement, bogus and predictable plot, and the ending.... what ending? Just left us abandoned like the canisters. This movie was boring even with the excellent actors. No wonder it went straight to DVD."
3,scarlet,I LIKE COLIN FIRTH THAT IS THE REASON I GOT THIS MOVIE BUT I WAS VERY LET DOWN NOT INPRESSED WITH IT AT ALL COLIN IS ALWAY GOOD BUT I THINK IT IS BADLY NEED OF MORE OF A STORY LINE .I WOULD HAVE LIKE MORE INFO ON WHAT OR WHO WAS CAUSING THAT PROBLEM
4,Good Character Study of Small Community Life,"This movie was a good character study of small community life. Having been brought up in a small town myself I could really relate to the characters. It was a sweet, sensitive, modest film that enthralled me. The acting is superb. Some people will find it slow moving. I enjoyed it however."
2,"Weak plot, no i mean no plot!",What the heck was the plot!! Who ever wrote the script has no imagination No entertainment value. Only reason i went to the end. I was hoping something would start to make more sense of what you expect out of a movie...thumbs down!
1,Most Boring Movie Ever,"I'm not sure how this movie got such good reviews. The actors were fine, but it was such a slow moving movie. You have a guy who comes to town to say hazardous waste can save their town, but finally realizes accidents happen and that would be bad. There was a second story taking place, one of those I love you, but I want out of this town things. Too bad the whole love story received so little screen time."
1,What a waste!,"What a waste of a cast! The script was as flat and uninspired as the movie's direction. Patricia Clarkson delivered the weakest, most boring performance of her career, in my opinion. The story was lacking in a compelling conflict. There was no story climax or resolution. What was anybody thinking in being a part of this train-wreck? I guess the actors and crew desperately needed a paycheck."
4,Great addition to the AquaDoodle Mat or Travel Set!,"These stampers are very durable, a great size, with the perfect size handle for toddlers, and come with a very nice tray to dampen them in. These are a very nice addition to any AquaDoodle set! Definately recommend them!"
3,Tire Storage,"Buyers should be aware of their tire and rim dimensions before ordering. My Honda Odyssey tires and rims would not fit completely in the bag and just slightly too big. Other than that, it was as expected. I had a similar product that fit those tires and just assumed the two items were close in specs.Buyers beware....."
4,Tire Storage Garage,It is utilitarian and does the job I wanted it for neatly. I hope for seveal years of use so I will not know until later whether to add the fifth star
3,"Nice concept, but not very robust","I think another reviewer mentioned how fragile (relatively speaking) this storage system is. I can confirm that it isn't very robust. The seam between the rubberized bottom and the gray nylon side is not strong. Pull a little too hard on one of the straps and it will rip. My rip appears to be small enough that a piece of duct tape will fix it, but it's still extremely annoying.Otherwise the product is good. Easily fit my 4 wheels (215/50R17 Blizzaks on alloy rims) with room to spare. The material used for the main parts seems to be reasonably sturdy. I wouldn't leave this outside in the sun and elements, but under a deck or in a garage should be fine. Although I'll be testing that and can report back in a year."
1,Falsely Advertised,"BEWARE - this is not ""a universal fit"" covering. This product although claimed as fitting any tire will only accept rather small communter car tires.Email the seller to get specific sizes. I tried to get a set of small SUV tires into it and the they would not fit at all."

4,rice cooker,"The quality is great, the rice cooks to perfection. I have not use any of the other features. Generally, I cook rice daily so I have not tested the quality of the rice left overnight. The top removable steamer could have been of better quality. Other than that, it's a great little guy!"
5,Sanyo ECJ-F50S Rice Cooker and Steamer,I have used this item three times a week since I received it for Christmas. It makes the most wonderful rice and is very easy to use and clean. Bravo!
4,Basic rice cooker,I purchased this to replace mine. My daughter walked off with the previous one. It looked similar but not as easy to operate. Make sure you wash the rice first. It does what it is designed to do. Good rice.
4,its ok,"noticeably slower than the 30$ Macy's rice cooker.rice is better, but not great (worth extra 90$): even cooking on the slow mode, top of the rice is slightly drier ... although it does not brown the bottom like a 30$ cooker. rice is fluffiest on the bottom 1/3rd ...maybe i havent figured how best to use it although its not rocketscience.menu sucksmuch easier to clean than the 30$ rice cooker..."
4,"A chip off the old (Zojirushi) block - micro computer chip, that is","Impressions:Fuzzy logic and a (relatively) thicker cooking pot were the primary reasons I bought this. Lasted for about two years before the aluminium steam plate cracked around the rubber cup where it attaches to the lid. Sanyo doesn't have a model-specific parts replacement. Good thing it's heavy, which enhances its use as a doorstop. But while it was in service it was indispensable.In summary, a haiku would be appropriate:Cooks rice well, fluffyGood cooker but some better;Zojirushi best"
3,buyer beware,"This is a discontinued product. Therefore you will not be able to replace the inner pot which scratches easily. The cooker has performed well, if slowly.But don't buy it without getting a second inner pot at the same time. Since Sanyo is out of business, this may be impossible."
1,Doesn't last - DO NOT BUY - bad design,"The rice cooker works well, BUT it has non-serviceable lithium battery soldered on the circuit board in the electronics box that houses the control panel. When the battery is depleted after ~5 years the unit won't work. And it will cost more than 50% of the original price to send it to the Sanyo service center for replacing the $3 battery. If you are handy and try to replace the battery, there isn't a standard battery holder, just two flimsy contacts that you have pry off the old battery and no straightforward way to insert the replacement battery without doing some modification / hacking. Search the internet for this problem and you will see it is a common problem with ALL Sanyo rice cookers - do not buy any Sanyo rice cooker - bad design, bad service, and you will lose the entire machine for the sake of $3 battery that the manufacturer intentionally decided to make inaccessible and non-serviceable."
1,STUPID: Owner may not replace battery!,"Well, this is the most idiotic thing. When the battery dies - and the battery *will* eventually die, you have to ship it to a repair center for replacement! I live in NYC, so I have to pack it up and send it to California - the only center in the USA that Sanyo refers to handle the unit?I spoke to the repair center and the cost would be $25 for a diagnosis, plus $40 for labor, plus shipping costs: $65+ to replace a tiny battery! Even the person I spoke to at the repair center thought it was economically ridiculous to send the unit to them just to replace the battery, and she tried to dissuade me from doing it.Seriously, you have to disassemble the unit in order to get to the front panel, then disassemble the electronic front panel to get to the battery. I kid you not. Trust me, it ain't easy - and you risk breaking something in the process. Unless you feel comfortable performing brain surgery, stay away from this unit!Sanyo - very, very, stupid."
1,"Sanyo out of business, parts no longer available!","I bought this a few years ago. It worked fine with some limitations.However now it's unusable because of a minor feature which renders the whole unit unusable.It's the rubber gasket around the inner lid that has cracked. When you cook rice, especially poridgethe liquid leaks out from the crack (it boils over and the pressure pushes it out from the top)and rice was left uncooked. This product came with 2 inner lids. When the first one brokewe switched to the 2nd one. Now the 2nd one broke as well. I called Panasonic (who bought Sanyo)they claim Sanyo is out of business and the parts are no longer available.This is too expensive a rice cooker to throw away after a minor thing broke. If they don't supply the parts they shouldn't even sell this product!"
4,Good General Rice Cooker; Easy to use;,"Pros: Easy to use for basic Rice cooker, just add rice, water, press the start button, it does the rest. Nice titanium coated heavy pot will hopefully last longer than our previous rice cooker pot did before it started rusting.Cons: After cooking rice, the top gets dirty easily and has to be cleaned after cooking each pot of rice. Does not come with a rice paddle or holder.Summary: Haven't yet tried the timer feature. Easy to use, solid rice cooker, Nice Heavy duty pot, hopefully won't rust. Have to clean the top inside part after cooking rice."
4,Dan in Oregon,"First, let me say, that I love Shostakovich. Unfortunately, the recorded sound is so bad that this CD is painful to listen to. The microphone sounds like it was situated in the last row.The instruments take a back seat to coughing and other room noises.Well here I am writing an ""amendment"" to this review I wrote several years ago. {the preceding sentence] I now think that I was overly harsh in my criticism of this recording. Although there are some extraneous noises, overall, this is really an excellent performance."
2,"Lemon, Tangerine & Lime are good. Yechy Cherry & Pineapple","If only there were a way to get an assortment that consisted of the Tangerine, Lemon and Lime.The Cherry & Pineapple are terrible. Expensive candy and I'm throwing away 2/5ths of it."
5,Sour Candies,"These are some of the best sour candies. They have a tart liquid center and are my husbands' absolute favorite hard candy in the world. They arrived on time, in fact a little ahead of time, from the vendor. They mad my husbands' birthday a little ""sweeter""."
1,Rascist Swine,"I don't know where this author gets his ideas. Where does he come off calling the South Vietnemese ""Snookers? "" They were our allies for crying out loud! Without their help, Communism would today be running rampant throughout our glorious nation, and we would all be atheists! This man should try living in a VietCong death camp for four years, 3 months, 6 days -- and then critize the US!"
4,GOOD QUALITY,"The product can be delivered to my home on time.Amazon send email to me to report the progress of delivery! Good!The quality of this book is good. The price is resonable! if the postage fee can be decreased, it would be better."
3,"More writing and talking about sex, than how to do it","I picked up this highly priced book for my collection of ""sexual techniques"" books. I wont go as far as saying that its terrible, or that its wonderful.I thought that it had way to much writing in it, just random talking about history of sex and other stuff like that. It needs to have more about how to go about doing the possisions etc.The pictures are all drawings, other than a few in the beginning, but the drawings are old looking and a little dull.One good thing that I found about the book is the slang that they used in it though. It is hard to find a book that uses slang terms rather than the correct way. I have quite a few sex books, and this is the only one that goes far enough to use [modern phrases], rather than, ""vagina"" and ""penis"". I mean, come on, we all know that most people in bed dont use the term ""vagina"".If you are looking for more of a history on sex, get it. If you want detail, pass it up."
2,Nothing New Here,"On the plus side, this book has nicely artistic erotic sketches and a few tasteful photos, but on the whole, unless you know nothing about sex and are starting off from scratch, you won't find much new in this book. The book was considered hot stuff when it first came out, but let's not forget it was also still taboo to have a good heart to heart about S-E-X. This is a nice book to page through in a book store, but don't waste your money buying it."
1,Seemed to be male-chauvinistic,"The book has some good points. I was very annoyed with the author's bias view on sexual body parts. He is a medical doctor yet uses vulgar terms for women and medical terms for men. Hm, sounds a bit chauvinistic to me. There is much to be said for the positions suggested in this book. I purchased the book but returned it after discovering that it was void of how to have ""Joy""."
5,Catholic History made Readable and Informative,"Well worth its price, this book covers the history of the Catholic Church in America in great detail. It combines interesting stories with the basic facts. With a good index, I need no other book to study American Church History."
2,"""The Theology Department is Down the Hall""","Think of four of the most orthodox Catholic colleges in the U.S. Okay, one of these - and I'm not naming it so that they don't get a diatribe - is so negative about this book, that when students have referenced it in class, the professors have responded drily, ""We teach history here. The Theology Department is down the hall."" I know this because my son graduated with a major in history from that school.When one parent complained to a long-distance learning school that was basing its American history curriculum on this ""history"" text - because, as the reviewer ""David"" notes, the entire chapter on World War II makes no mention of Jews - she was told by the director, ""Well, lots of people have suffered. Look at the Irish - they've suffered."" If that kind of reasoning as to why Jews should not be mentioned in a chapter on World War II makes sense to you, you may like this book."
1,Not Really History,"If your objective is to teach about the Catholic Church in America, this book might be of some value. But as an American History textbook it is a joke. Significant events -- such as the 19th amendment and the women's suffrage movement -- are entirely ignored. And if you think it is possible to write about the Second World War and never once mention the words ""Jew"" or ""concentration camp,"" then this is the book for you. But there IS an entire chapter on ""no Irish need apply."" You'll also have to deal with a prose style that is ponderous and often difficult to understand, and a polemical presentation that is determined not to let the reader make up his own mind about anything.It's worth noting that the author has no credentials whatsoever to write a history text, but since that's not what this book is, apparently that doesn't matter to Anne Carroll."
2,Content Good but book damaged,"I ordered this for a class I am teaching for Middle Schoolers about all of the J.K. Rowlings books. It would have made a nice addition to the course but it arrived damaged. The cover had seperated from the pages. I was very disapointed that my only choice was to get a refund. I would have liked to get another copy of the book but that option was blocked out on the web site. As a result I had to change my lesson plans and the kids missed out on a great lesson about mapping and literature. I've never had a problem with ordering anything from Amazon before, so this turned out to be an unwanted surprise."
2,"Alright, but.....","There wasn't nearly as much information as I'd thought there would be, but the map is pretty neat. As far as the myths go, anyone over the age of 15 or so should know most of them, but there are a few in the book that even suprised me."
2,A Little Disappointed,This book is fine for real young readers who are just getting into mythology. It is a fine introduction but not a lot of details.
3,Cute...,This book is simple yet cute. It has a nice map with exaggerated drawings representing where the certain items are that they are discussing. Great addition to a HP collector but only takes about 10 minutes to read.
2,Short and inadequate book.,"I bought this book from Amazon.com. I couldn't have the chance to explore the item from the net. When I took it in my hands, I really was disappointed. The idea is perfect. But this book should have been like an encyclopedia, with maps, illustrations and all the stuff. But it was a short, very brief version of the huge idea.. but again, the idea was perfect."
2,sloppy,"I read this book for a class, and was disappointed. The writing could have been a lot clearer, and there were numerous typos which is very problematic when you are trying to read/learn code)"
3,"What an exhausting product, whew!!","To the person saying this is a ""Shoulder Massager"", take a look at the title of this page, please?!?""Hello Kitty Vibrator Massager MASTURBATOR - New From Japan""Hello?And to the person who tried it five times before returning it - first of all ewwwww - but second it really took you five times to decide you don't like it? (ehem... fickle... ahem)All in all it was worth the money. The little pink bow melted between my thighs like a little river of cotton candy. I thought the ears were painful too, but then I just turned it around, there are no sharp edges on the other end and I can see Kitty better like that!Three meows up. Its only distinction is the Hello Kitty tip, but who doesn't love Hello Kitty. Look elsewhere for products that actually work better."
1,Buy my vibrator,"I would like to start by saying that of all the Japanese animated vibrators I have owned this was by far the most disappointing. The pink bow added no stimulation whatsoever and the ears were down right painful. After 5 completely unsatisfying uses I returned the item and went back to using my old friend pikachu.Imagine my surprise when a week after my ""return"" a used Hello Kitty Vibrator pops up for sale at double the price tag, whatever you do dont purchase the used item I beg of you!!!"
2,Drivel,"Betsy is a tall young woman who dies, is brought back to life somehow, and since she's immune to several things that other vampires are (sunlight, garlic, being killed), she's nominated as the queen. She's a shallow shallow girl, without much personality besides being perturbed most of the time. She starts a relationship with another vampire, and there is a lot of sex. As for plot...well, they throw that in once in a while, but otherwise, I cannot see much reason for reading this book...and I read every one of the four-book collection. Just wasn't interesting."
3,Could have been easier...,"I've been baking the past month and am very excited about baking. So far, I've been using recipes from Allrecipes.com. Getting this book really excited me because of the wonderful pictures and easy step-by-step instructions... until I tried actually baking with it, that is.I felt that there were not enough information for a novice baker regarding a few key important details that would help with a recipe. For one thing, I don't know what amounts to ""1 package active dry yeast"". In addition, my oven temperature is in deg celsius, while the recipes are in farenheit. There ought to be a conversion table somewhere in the book to help. Also, after trying out a recipe, I realised that there might possibly be a difference between US cups and UK cups - and *shudders* I am beginning to suspect that that might have affected the recipe too.Nonetheless, I do like the variety and pictures that the book has - it does inspire me to try out the recipes because the steps do look manageable."
1,Burnt dirt,I tried this and couldn't eat more than one cracker. My entire family agrees that these crackers have a flavor best described as burnt dirt. These are the worst-tasting thing I've had since going gluten-free.
3,"Good, but...","Mary's crackers would have gotten a 5 star rating - I really like their taste, and they have lots of crunch to satisfy my crunch cravings. I'm not gluten intolerant, but was looking for a healthy, crunchy snack. I thought I had found it, however, they are a little *too* crunchy. There are pieces of rice in these crakcers that are a little bigger than I think they should be. Many times, I worried that I would break a tooth because of these pieces that felt like rocks, and I ended up having to be very careful how I chewed. I would love to purchase more, but I fear doing some serious dental damage..."
5,Amazing Crackers!,"Even if I wasn't gluten free, I would LOVE these crackers. They are so flavorful and are good for you. Eating them plain is wonderful but they are to die for with almost any cheese. Try a smoked cheddar."
4,Interesting product...can be difficult to find locally,"One of my friends is big into organic foods and introduced me to these crackers. They are extremely crunchy & crisp, reasonably low in calories (140 calories for 13 crackers) and don't contain any gluten, wheat or high fructose corn syrup.They do have a slight nutty flavor, but the texture makes me think I am eating bird seed.They don't taste salty at all to me, but contain 190mg of sodium per serving.Obviously, if you have wheat or gluten allergies, these crackers could be perfect for you. If you are like me and eat pretty much anything there are better crackers out there, but these are probably a bit healthier than most.I would like to try other flavors, but I'm not willing to purchase a box of 12 just to find out I didn't like it. It would be nice if Amazon sold an assortment of 12."
1,DISGUSTING!!!!,"If you all want a tasty, light, crispy wheat free cracker I recommend KOYO brand organic rice crackers. They have a few flavors like garlic and I think teriyaki (though I can't find that one lately). These mary's things taste like card board and sand. Who would review these so highly? Maybe they like the flavor of cardboard and sand. I myself like a light, crispy, more flavorful cracker. I like teh KOYO but I am getting bored of just that one brand so I keep looking for more organic wheat free crackers but when my husband and I tried the ""Mary's"" we both almost threw up. I instantly threw the whole box in the garbage. Also the KOYO are sturdy enough for dipping too."
5,Best Cracker EVER,"My friend brought the sesame crackers to an appetizer party and they were gone in a matter of minutes. I had never had these before and have to say this is the best cracker I've EVER had. I love the sesame flavor and the awesome ""crunch."" I'll be buying these from now on."
2,Mary's gone and so too will be your teeth...,"These crackers are way too crunchy. They remind me of the corn nuts people used to eat in high school. Just way too hard on your teeth! The flavor really isn't that bad considering what they have to work with being gluten free and all, but I just can't get past how crunchy they are. My teeth ache just looking at them."
1,These are the worse tasting product I have ever had!,"I bought a case after reading such great reviews. UGH!! I spit it out. Was VERY VERY strong tasting, but not a pleasant taste at all. I thought well maybe its just me, so I have a few friends that are celiac so I shared with them. Same reaction, this 1 used it in her turkey thinking well its strong but maybe with a big turkey, oh my no 1 could eat it. I really don't know how people can say these are good, I only got the original flavor, it really was terrible, I threw them away. I know some people get paid to leave a review on here, I don't know if that is the reason for the good review or what. Usually the reviews help me decide what products to try with Celiac, but wow you guys were WAY OFF for me anyway. I threw the whole case away. IT was the only thing in the trash that the raccoons didnt get into for real. buyer beware~~!!!"
1,Burnt Birdseed!,"I bought these accidentally, because I thought they were the crunchmaster crackers. I tried eating them multiple times, putting cheese on them, creamed cheese, jam, etc. It ruined the flavour of the things i put on it. They were so gross I couldn't believe that they would actually be for sale, so I returned them to Costco, who understood that they were inedible, and let me get the right crackers instead. Blech, I get a bad taste in my mouth just remembering them."
2,Too crunchy,"The flavor is OK, considering it's gluten free, but actually not that tasty. After eating half a bag, I threw the rest away, because it has hard grain bits - really hard. I recently broke a tooth biting down on something as hard as the grain bits in this cracker, and the dentist bill was close to $1000. I'm not going to chance breaking another tooth with these crackers."
1,Taste like dirt,I could not finish the box I bought. My daughter's friend said they taste like dirt. He was right.
1,Found a Small Rock!!,"While eating this cracker, I bit into what seemed like a peppercorn, but upon closer inspection, it was a small rock! I couldn't believe it! Good thing I was chewing slowly and didn't chip my teeth! I emailed the company but received no response."
1,Taste Awful,"These crackers taste awful. I thought it was just me until my family tried them.YUCK!!! I've tried putting peanut butter on them, dips, guacamole but they still taste bad.I'm an MT and also look for Gluten Free, but these crackers just do not taste good. I through the box away."
1,Tastes like burnt popcorn...,"My dd has celiac's and while I don't often try to replace foods, I do like to have easy, crunchy snacks for her. I love flax so I thought these would be great. They are horrible and taste just like burnt popcorn. Even my husband agreed that is what we tasted. I threw the box away."
5,Best munchie around,"Love keeping them in the house for snacking. Cannot go wrong. Great value, and sooo much better than chips or sweets. A great product!"
5,Love these! ^_^,"These r great I like them with cheese or fruit on them or just by them selves.Thy r crunchy with flavors of toasted nuts, sesame seeds, caraway seeds which r a little bitter but still good."
2,a rushed random ending...,"At first I thought the story was cute, but as I began to read more. I started to dislike this book at the very end. Some parts seemed very rushed while other parts seem to need more detail. I felt as if the author put to many things in this book without taking time to address them right. Leaving it with a rushed random ending ."
3,Not the originals,"I was expecting poem-format for the Lais, but these are translated into Modern English and prose verse poetry. I wouldn't mind the translations if they weren't so bland."
4,Unique and Insightful,"The Lais of Marie de France are some of the few poems written by a woman during the middle ages. Her account of King Arthur's court brings a new perspective on the King Arthur legends. Written from the perspective of a woman, Marie offers a unique interpretation on the King Arthur myths in her lais ""Lanval"". In this distinctly female poem, the action is all driven by the female characters, Queen Guinevere and the Maiden. Marie juxtaposes these two characters to comment on the social constructions of her time, most importantly courtly love. Marie also sets up a parallel world to Arthur's kingdom and court with the Maiden. Through the development of the Maiden and Arthur, Marie portrays the Arthur myth in an uncommon female light that offers to the reader a new perspective on the Arthurian love as well as the lives of medieval women."
4,Far out space operas,"""Destination Moon"" and ""Rocketship XM"" both came out the same year -- but that is where the similarity ends. I consider ""Destination Moon"" the father of the modern science-fiction film. The quality of the production and the gorgeous Technicolor give this film a quality few later '50's sci-fi films would achieve. What helps this flm is the fact that there are no real stars in it -- but very competent and very recognizable actors at the least. ""Rocketship XM"" on the other hand was a hurry-up film made to beat ""...Moon"" to the theaters. The B/W print quality is gorgeous, having been restored to its original sharp quality. Lloyd Bridges stars. The special effects for ""XM"" were decent for their time, but the effects for ""...Moon"" were ahead of their time. If I were grading these films, I would give ""..Moon"" a B+, and ""XM"" a C+. Both films are enjoyable, and make nice companion pieces."
3,Units stop working,"I have owned 3 Maxi-glides and have always had good results with the performance. The other people who complain about burning their hair probably have the heating element set too high. Those who complain that the units are not straightening their hair, are obviously not partitioning off the sections to get the best results. My hair has always come out great. My only problem with this unit is that one side ceases to heat up after using it for a time. The last unit that I got stopped working properly 5 days ago and the blue light just continues to blink, as one side does not heat up. I agree that the cost of this unit is horrible compared to the reliability of it. This company needs to guarantee their units for longer than just one year. This last unit that I own only lasted 18 months."
1,:(,"I thought this product would be excellent, because of all the good reviews. I followed the directions. It didn't straighten my hair. It pulled my hair. waste of money."
5,holy cow!!!,"I am in absolute shock as to how great this thing is! I never believed it would work half as well as it did on tv, but due to the great reviews I bought it. I have to say, if this flat iron cost 500.00 I would pay it. It is so worth the money. My hair is long, thick, curly, frizzy and puffy. One gentle slide of the iron and it was bone straight and SOFT!! I only spent maybe 10 inutes and my whole head was done! Normally I would take up to 45 minutes, easy and not get nearly the beautiful results. I am so happy, especially since I have a two year old and this is such a time saver. Awesome value, beautiful results. I must say though, I like a little wave in my hair and this iron makes it bone straight, but I have since perfected how to use it to make some pretty waves."
3,"It Straightens, BUT . . . . .","The product does straighten as advertised, BUT I find it very heavy and clumsy to operate and to pack when traveling. Very disappointed with mini glide as it doesn't heat up and straighten nearly as well as the maxi glide."
1,Pulls at hair too much,"Like many others, I have seen the infomercials for this product and finally decided to give it a try. I have been using hair straighteners for years, but liked the idea of a product that was not so hot (therefore, not so damaging), plus the steam option. My first reaction upon trying Maxi Glide was that it pulled at my hair too much. I tried not squeezing the plates when closing it, but it still pulled at my hair. I also didn't like how heavy it was. I purchased this from Bed Bath & Beyond and returned it yesterday. I was disappointed that for this price the product was not a lot better, it seems as though it should range in the $20-30 range."
3,Excellent iron but it broke pretty fast....,"This iron is excellent, but I'm surprised that as expensive as this iron was, that it is already broken. I've owned it a little over a year and was extra careful with it, as you all know it's not cheap!The dial that turns it on and sets the heat level, just broke , I always handled it very carefully, all my cheap irons last for years no problem. But it is very good otherwise and best of luck to the rest of you with yours. I'll try the Conair one next that someone here mentioned ."
3,it okay,"Well i was so excited for this product, i used it and it did a good job, my hair was still frizzy even though they talked up the steam burst, it bursts your hair up if you don't know how to use it properly and it is a lil heavy. Make sure and watch the dvd for proper instructions."
2,"Lots of errors, but useful for learning ""trick"" questions","WARNING! This book contains MANY errors about how Photoshop works. If you're looking for a good learning resource for Adobe Photoshop 5, this is a poor choice. To learn most effectively about the program you would be far better off with Peachpit Press' ""Real World Photoshop"" or their ""Photoshop 5 for Windows and Macintosh - Visual Quickstart Guide,"" or Adobe Press' ""Photoshop 5 Classroom In A Book.""What this book IS good for is learning about the process of taking Adobe's proficiency exam, and what kind of trick questions to look out for.

1,Great door-stop book!,"As review books go, this one needs to be worked on some more. It isn't very helpful when there are so many inaccuracies. I finally gave up and found this book makes a better-than-average doorstop. At least it's good for something!"
3,Good information with few errors.,"I bought Photoshop 5.0 Exam Cram to study for the ACE Exam. I found that the book contains a wealth of information that is essential to passing the ACE exam. This book is intended to help the reader focus on information pertinent to the test. The book does this well. However, I was dismayed a bit to find the few errors that I did. It is my professional opinion that a certification guide should be without error. Overall, I would still recommend this book to anyone interested in passing the ACE Exam"
4,Concise Helpful Guide,"The ACE exmaine I don't think is an easy task. This book summarizes and organizes information that is important to passing the exam. What I found helpful was details on how to take the test, and the little trick question that can throw a monkey wrech into taking the test if your not aware of them. Have fun and good luck."
3,Good!..,Full of errors but gives u a feeling of the exam tricks.. well i can say it's useful somehow..
1,Does not charge the battery,"I bought this thinking that it would charge the battery, but it does not. It is only for powering the camera to save battery life while downloading pictures to you pc or while printing. i guess that you can also take pictures while its plugged in. Why would you need something like this? It doesn't seem like a very useful product to me."
4,Starr Bright,"""Lady Lessons"" provided great insight into this unique Regency Period of time. A very enjoyable tale with unforgettable characters and a wonderful love story. Sarah Starr's first time novel is a pleasurable evening read."
4,Satirical and Educational,"I read this book for a class at USydney. It discusses Aboriginal attitudes to the destruction of the Outback through uranium mining & nuclear testing in the style of the Aboriginal oral mythology tradition. It was a very fast read, entertaining, & informative on all sorts of levels. It's also a good introduction to Aboriginal writing styles & Aboriginal issues. An interesting book in its own right."
3,"Jeopardy was okay, To Please A Lady was better",Bought this DVD to see Jeopardy which I had partially seen earlier; it's a captivating story but the ending was disappointing.I was pleasantly surprised by To Please A Lady... it's a good all around flick for a lazy Saturday afternoon especially if you like heritage racing.
2,Both could have been much better,"To Please a Lady needed leads 15 to 20 years younger. Even then its pretty ordinary except for the ""thrill"" driving stunts. Gable and Stanwyck deserved something much better. Watch them together in Night Nurse where they both sizzle!!!Jeopardy is pretty boring......not much of a vehicle for anyone, a real waste for Stanwyck,"
3,Eh,"It's not the worst movie, but it certainly isn't the best. Robin Williams does a good job as an actor for this film, but the storyline itself is rather lacking. This is the kind of movie that is best to rent or better yet, watch for free on TV. I can't really recommend it otherwise."
2,BAAAD....,"Robin Williams is definitely not like wine... As time goes by, he gets worse and worse, accepting ridiculous scripts like this one. I hope he improves, because he has already given us great performances like ""DEAD POETS SOCIETY""."
2,The car saves the film from the scrap heap!,"Robin Williams soaring in the heavens in his cool T-bird is the only thing worthwhile in this remake of the classic ""The Absent-Minded Professor"". The robot assistant is cute and the dancing flubber shows off the prowess of the special effects technicians, but, as a film, ""Flubber"" insults even the intellect of a three-year-old."
1,SLEEP MASTER 2000! GAURENTEED SLEEP IN MINUTES!,"I gave it one star because there was nothing lower! This piece of trash wasted the rest of my night. I fell sound asleep in 15 minutes. I didn't wake up until 9:00 am. I'm just warning you not to watch this poorly done movie. There absolutley no plot-line what so ever. A spray that can make you bounce in the air higher than a basket-ball hoop in the NBA! Please! Kinda funny I heard, but I wouldn't know of course because I was asleep. If you like robin williams, get Jack , patch adams, or jumanji."
2,Dancing Globs make me wozzy,"Wow this was disappointing. The stupid parts outweight the good stuff. What a waste. With all the potential to make a real interesting story, and with all the high tech capabilities now vs when the original was made this should have been a real fun movie to watch. It is not. Most of my kids had left the room before the end. definitely rent before you buy."
1,NOT HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!,i'm not going to rate you good until i get one that i'm satisfied with...............!!!!!!!!!!! iF YOUR GOING TO SELL SOMETHING BAD LIKE THIS YOU SHOULD HAVE IT TO WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE IT BEFORE THEY BUY......
1,Not one of Robin William's best,"We purchased this because the previews looked hilarious...good grief they were the only good part of the film. Foolish and simple and we didn't find it funny at all...actually we were pretty surprised we made it all the way through. I remember the old Absent Minded Professor movie from years ago and maybe it wasn't as funny as I remembered (I was just a kid and back then everything was funny), but I believe it was a lot better than this movie...off to the thrift store with this one!"
3,Kids Did Not Like It,I bought this as a movie our whole family could watch. My kids really did not like it. I love Robin Williams and the movie is ok but I would not buy it again.
3,Not as good as i thought it would be,"Flubber was a very interesting movie. Some scenes were funny, and some scenes were just not. But Robin Williams did a okay job. This movie you should worth seeing once."
4,Good family fun and inspiring for inventive types,"The movie is a great escape, with some good humor and energy. After seeing the cool flying robotic assistant and the flying car, it made me enjoy dreaming and innovating. Some of those negative reviews were apparently given by those with the sense of humor of a piece of wood. Robin Williams is great at playing an absent minded professor, with some hillarious statements and events. His fiance was a great companion in the movie, with her sweet disposition."
2,The first (and hopefully last) Disney let-down,"Well, even the best have to fall someday, and Disney managed it with the release of Flubber. Robin Williams, who isn't greatly entertaining at the best of times, is actually quite acceptable in this film. However the general jist of the story, and the comedy, and the adventure, and the dialogue ...etc etc has all been done better before. The story follows a professor (Robin Williams) and his discovery of an exciting new elastic material - technically known as Flubber - though he is hunted down by corporate businesses, whilst his absent-mindedness severely puts his love plans on hold. Predictable, dull and a genuine failure of a film. The 1967 original is much better.Looking for good family entertainment? Go buy Free Willy"
1,It stunk!!,This was a horible movie!! It made me puke when I watched it!! This was the worst movie I have ever seen(other than the adventures of Barney).
1,I give this a one becuase ther is nothing lower,Here are some of the things that FLUBBER is missing. - Acting - A point - Some funny parts - Did I mention a point - Intelligent dialoge - And of coarse the all importent point to the movie.
2,GOT RUINED BY SLAPSTICK COMEDY,"THIS FILM IS FUN TO WATCH,BUT WHAT RUINS IT IS IT'S RESORT TO SLAPSTICK COMEDY IN MANY SCENES."
3,flub you!,"there is a really old version to this too.the only real 2 flaws in this one are robin williams and his pesky wife.why cant he seem to get along with women in any of his movies?well,robin is an extremely absent minded inventor who makes a jelly like putty that is semi-intelligent and has many many uses.the kids dont really go for it except when the putty is about.its worth seeing once id say.like i mentioned,robin has a girls name and cant seem to keep it together with chicks in his films.in birdcage he was gay.he was a cross dresser in mrs doubtfire.there was some movie about drag queens where he was in briefly as a gay character.i think ive made my point.kids tend to cry when robins robot dies.that guy who played in the rocky horror picture show as a transvestite is robins rival in this one."
1,! DANGER! This film blows chunks,"This is an excellent example of a bad film. Disney has really outdone itself on this one... Viewers should be warned that this film has been documented to cause decay in the frontal lobe of the subjects brain. Please, I beg you, Do NOT even bother viewing this. I'm suprized Robin Williams hasn't lost his will to live after participating in the making of this monstrosity."
5,Sword of Despiration,Another great movie and I like the action and story plot . The actors were good in their portrayal and sequences.
2,"Was so, so","IT was not the sword action I expected, and a lousy story, but still OK but nothing like Young Samurai"
4,The A to Z of the Tao,"This dictionary explains the basic doctrines and terminology of the ancient Chinese philosophy in a clear and understandable manner. It does not cover the entire range of Taoist concepts as it is intended for the general reader.The literal meaning of each entry is given when it differs from the definition of the entry title. In more than 300 entries, from Chai to Y? Yen, the book unlocks the meaning of concepts and terms that are nowadays encountered with increasing frequency in the media, sciences, psychology and health professions.The Wade-Giles system of transcription is used instead of Pinyin and there are conversion charts from the Pinyin to the Wade-Giles system and vice versa. The book includes illustrations and concludes with a bibliography."
5,Most Worthwhile; a must for serious students of Taoism,"From the time I first discovered this little book in the public library, it has been my constant companion. Although a Taoist sage or scholar may not find it useful, to a beginning student it will be indispensable. Most works on Taoism are reminiscent of a Russian novel: lots of strange names that the reader has a hard time remembering and keeping straight. With this book you can actually do it. There's an entry for just about any name or term that you're likely to encounter, and the cross-references are superb. Some readers may be put off by the author's preference for the Wade-Giles transliteration, rather than the official Pinyin. But once you've become familiar with the former, the latter will be easier to learn. I wouldn't hesitate recommending this book, even though, in time, the student will probably outgrow it. J. Thacker"
2,A decent introductory dictionary,"This work serves as a decent introductory dictionary to Taoist terminology, but is not nearly as comprehensive as it could be. I would have preferred the use of pinyin romanization instead of the old Wade-Giles/Yale systems, and would also have liked to have seen the Chinese characters included (unlikely to happen in a text meant for the general public, though) as well as the actual diagrams which are mentioned and not shown (the ""taijitu"", for example). For beginners this is a good work. For those who already have a fair knowledge of the subject, it's not really necessary. Not a bad effort, though."
1,Biovault 2.0 quit working,"I let the battery run down, I replace with new batteries ,now it does not recognize my fingerprint and I can't find a help website.The web site in the handbook does not work."
1,Stopped working and Sequiam no longer in business.,"Like others here, the BioVault works great for a while, 2 years for me. Now it drains all 3 D cell batteries every 2 weeks, and won't open without a fresh set of batteries. I've checked the voltage of the power supply and it checks out, and the safe even acknowledges that the power supply works, but still drains the batteries. Finally, there is no support because the Sequiam corporation no longer exists."
1,Eventually will Fail,"Just like all of the other reviews, this product will eventually fail (mine within 3 years). It became less and less responsive to my fingerprints. Mine is now locked without any support from the bankrupt company and I will likely be forced to cut it open. Do not buy this product."
1,Do Not Buy This Product - Sequiam Biometrics no longer exists!,"I bought this device a few years ago and it worked well for quite some time. Now, like others you'll read in the reviews, the safe drains the D batteries within a couple of weeks and renders the unit inoperable until new batteries are used. I'm going to try to use a different power supply however from what I understand it doesn't make a difference. There must be a way to fix it however there is zero support out there for this product. Amazon should remove it.I will say that IF the safe worked properly it would be great. Other than the obvious deficiencies the safe seems well built and even with losing power and the batteries dying so quickly it still remembers our fingerprint scans. It is a shame that Sequiam Biometrics is gone."
5,Outstanding Series,"I bought the first of these three DVD's(Beginner 1) and found that to be an excellent DVD. It taught me the basics of right turns, left turns, and other basic turns.I then got the other two DVD's and found that I had a great foundation as regards to learning basic Swing Dancing. I found it best to see the DVD's several times and master one move before learning the next. I liked the explaination of both lead and follow basics. This way no one is left out.Also, the sections are well outlined so that if you want to practice one or two specific turns, there is easy access to that particular turn.This was a very wise investment for me.In addition, from e-mails that I have gotten from them, they really care about their students.Thanks again for an excellent series."
5,Much Better Than The Recent Version,"I first saw Black Christmas many years ago when I rented it on VHS at Blockbuster; so you know it was awhile back. I love 70's & 80's horror movies. I don't know if its' the creepy atmospheric scenery or what, but I love old horror movies from this time period. I like Black Christmas for the most part because you never get to see the killer; you only hear his creepy, crackling, high pitched screams on the other end of the telephone. I also love Margo Kidders' character, as a crass talking, booze drinking, bitchy housemate. I will say to anyone who loves horror movies; get Black Christmas and add it to your collection, you won't be disappointed."
5,My favorite horror movie,"I bought this with low expectations. I had never heard of it, but I saw it on that ""100 Scariest Movie Moments"" show. I figured that if Rob Zombie said it was scary, I should at least check it out. WOW! I loved it! It was not a gorefest and didn't have any sex scenes that were common to 70's horror, but the psycho in this movie is SO DISTURBING. All of his little voices and things really freaked me out! I thought it was a perfect plot, with perfect execution and a perfect ending that was common to many of the 70's classic horror movie genre. As others have said, it was the predecessor to Halloween and many other scary movies, so they all took bits and pieces from this awesome and underrated movie. I fear the remake will not be nearly as good as the original. How can you beat horror perfection? LOVED IT! And if you like great movies that are not jam-packed with senseless gore but freaky nonetheless, watch it!"
4,Review,"I saw this version of this movie for the first time recently in the past year or so, and liked it. And was happy to find out that I could purchase it from amazon.Thank you."
4,good christmas movie,"This is an overall creepy movie. way better than the remake, but not as gory. This movie that is based off a crazy man who is killing girls in their sorority house is quite scary. he picks them off 1 by 1 and ends quite chilling."
3,Saw Black Christmas Back In The Day...,"...in a theater and it scarred me tremendously. As an adult, nothing special. Some good creepy moments, but over all very typical 70's horror movie. There is noticable camera work (subjective angle shots by the psycho killer) that was adopted by John Carpenter four years later in Halloween. Halloween is two stars superior to this movie. Can I recommend it? Only if you are a huge fan of horror from all time periods and do not expect too much from this film. Don't get me wrong. Its not a bad movie, just not as great as many of the reviews I see glorifying it. You will have to decide on your own about whether its worth a purchase or not. It does not have the re-watchability factor like Halloween does. Its not the ending on either film, but the journey along the way that brings you back again and again or not. I just didn't think this journey was worth much of a second time around."
3,Not The Best Slasher I've Seen...,"Don't get me wrong, if you've read my reviews before, you'd know I love horror films, but this one is sorta boring at some parts. I actually saw the remake of Black Christmas before I saw this, maybe that's why I don't like it as much. In other words, I'm saying I like the remake better than the original. Usually, it's the other way around. It does have some good parts; like the killing scenes, and it has the classic look of the 70's. People are always saying this is the original slasher and HALLOWEEN isn't, but that doesn't matter to me. It doesn't matter which is the original slasher, because I love HALLOWEEN better. Maybe one day, I'll give this movie a 2nd chance. If you love classic slashers, maybe you'll like BLACK CHRISTMAS!!!"
4,Better than the remake....,"I like this stylish and atmospheric thriller by the director of A Christmas Story, but I didn't like it as I thought I was going too.I guess I was too excited because of all the hype the movie had gotten.Don't get me wrong though, I am not all disappointed I purchased it, and it's a masterpiece compared to the remake. I was just hoping for a more shocking film, I suppose.P.S.-The remake is ok, but that back story is gross...."
5,Underrated is an understatement!,"It's a shame that in this age of dime-a-dozen horror flicks, a film as great as Black Christmas can be pushed into such obscurity. I've repeatedly tried to rent this movie, and have found that NO area video store (including Blockbuster) carries it. It's quite a shame, when I search the racks and can find Blackula, but no Black Christmas. If this review can accomplish anything, I hope it will inspire someone who has not seen this movie to take a chance on it! It's well worth the money."
4,Very underrated,"Black Christmas is a very underrated slasher movie that needs more recognition. Jump starting the slasher scene, Black Christmas uses many of the elements Halloween does. But that can't be, Black Christmas came out 4 years earlier. When a Stranger Calls also owes this film plenty. Black Christmas is a very creepy movie with a great cast. Starring Olivia Hussey from the 1968 movie, Romeo and Juliet. The old Mrs. Mac is just a riot as she has many liquor bottles hidden around the house. Rent this movie better yet buy it it's worth every penny, but don't watch it alone for the first time it will give you major goosebumps."
5,I'VE SEEN THEM ALL.......THIS IS A CLASSIC!,"This movie made its mark well before Hallowe'en and Friday the 13th. Saw it first as a grown woman......saw it twice and the 2nd time only because it was re-released as Silent Night, Evil Night. Gave me serious nightmares. Expect it to happen again now that I own it. BUY THIS!"
4,"""Good Slasher/Horror Flick!""","Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder and John Saxon star in this 1974horror film. A psychotic killer stalks girls at a sorority house.This is a good film and this special edition has nice pictureand sound plus some neat extras. I recommend this."
4,One of THE BEST ORIGINALS.,"First time I saw ""BLACK CHRISTMAS""...I was spooked.I finally saw a REAL ""SCARY"" movie.I really have seen save alot of horror and chiller-thrillers from ""NOSFERATU(1922) TO NOW.Black Christmas is a cult/classic directed by the same director of CHRISTMAS STORY! THAT's GOOD.THAT'S TALENT OR INSANITY. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE.HEY,if BLACK CHRISTMAS rattles your tree,you can always watch CHRISTMAS STORY as a remedy to feeling safe to check ANY part of your house. 4STARS. jendrey123"
1,"disapointment, save your money.","I rented this because of the great reviews, boy I wish I had not wasted my money on this unscary, long, dull, predictable movie. Some reveiwers said this was one of the scariest movies they had seen?????Give me a break! There are some nursery rhymes that are more frightening than this. Margot Kidder is just annoying and I was so glad when she was killed."
1,HORRIBLE!,"i went to see this movie when it first came out, and i nearly fell asleep watching it. THIS MOVIE IS NOT WORTH WATCHING. it's so fake, & it's easy to tell whats going to happen next."
1,Completely Overrated,"This flick was so hyped I just had to see it. What a waste. It's stupid, totally ridiculous throughout. Plot has more holes than the Houston Texans defense. Predictable, not even scary. I mean they never check the attic? Cut the comedy please. We never find out a thing about the girls, this guy or really just about anything. The other reviews are just so bad. Honestly, what were you watching? This flick is a dog with fleas. Trust me take a pass on this dud. A total miss."
4,It still scares you,"""Black Christmas""is one of those handful of movies that inspire imitators galore. By today's standards, it seems a bit dated and not all that graphic - since most of the violence takes place off screen. But what it does have - psychological suspense, it has in spades. Those phone calls! They are disturbing to hear today as they were to listen to years ago when ""Black Christmas"" was first released. The rage and violence of the killer's voice is so explosive, so disturbing, that it elevates the typical formula of the movie (sorority house, isolated chicks being picked off by a psycho killer, clumsy cops) into the genuine ""cult"" zone. ""Black Christmas""deserves its reputation not so much because of anything new or groundbreaking as far as thrillers go - but because it remembers the one thing you need in such a movie (with all its limitations): a truly frightening killer. It's not a far leap to imagine that the guy screaming into the phone is Ted Bundy - and THAT is scarey."
4,Great Movie.....,"I just finished watching this movie and I must say it was good. Definatly what you would expect from a 70's horror movie. After watching this movie I realize how many horror movies that came after it that copied this classic. One of the things I like about older horror movies is the fact they provide ""mystery"" to the movie. Unlike with movies now that have an ""happy"" ending. Movies like this leave u wondering who was the killer? Definatly a buy for those that love classic horror movies."
5,This Is The Edition To Get! Ignore The 25th Anniversary Ed.,"This is the Critical Mass Collector's Edition of Black Christmas, released December 03, 2002. It's an update to their previous release, the 25th Anniversary Edition, and is available only in Canada. It is a dramatic improvement over that edition, featuring a brand new 1.66:1 widescreen transfer (though not anamorphic, alas), and a plethora of new extras including a 36 minute documentary, 2 audio commentaries, the complete script (!), poster galleries, still galleries, reversible cover art, TV spots, radio spots, interviews with principal cast members (including John Saxon) theatrical trailers, and alternate title sequences.This is the version to get. Ignore all others and order this."
4,Black Christmas,"I thought this move was alright. The phone call were creepy, but the in between was kind of boring. Like someone said, the last 20 minutes were pretty good. I did expect more by the reviews that it got. And to answer someone's question; I heard that ""when a stranger calls"" was supposed to be the sequal, but obviously it didn't out that way."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be....,"After reading several very positive reviews for it, I had to get this movie. I threw it in the DVD player and was fairly disapointed. Its a cool movie, but very SLOW! There are a few jumpy parts, besides that definetly not worth buying. This movie cant even come close to being compared to a great film like Halloween. So overall, Its worth a rent, the killer is pretty cool in some of the things he does, but dont buy it, You'l watch it once and it will be left on the shelf forever......"
2,"""not on my top 10 list...""","I waited a long time to get a rental of this movie from Blockbuster Online, and when i finally did; i was disappointed. This movie is not on my top 10 list of horror movies. i can see how it would have worked in the 70s and 80s, but having seen it for the first time today, it did nothing for me. although many people say that HALLOWEEN and WHEN A STRANGER CALLS borrowed a lot of ideas from BLACK CHRISTMAS, they were better movies than this. i will give it credit because the telephone calls were creepy, and the last 20 minutes of the movie were good. But was the identity of the killer supposed to be left unsolved? was a sequel planned? i can't imagine how the remake will make this movie any better."
5,movie,Ordered three copies of the movie for Christmas presents. They were delivered in two days! Great service and movies were in excellent shape. Thank you and will most definitely use that company again.
3,"And all through the house, not a creature was stirring... except maybe Billy","Black Christmas is a fun, old slasher pic. One that eschews most of the slasher film formulas for the better (not surprising since this was done before there was a 'slasher film' genre). The characters behave realisticly and they respond to threats in ways that won't make you angry.The movie has a nicely creepy opening and a terrific half hour of an ending. The problem is that there's forty minutes or so in the middle that is sorta draggy. It isn't wasted time or anything, but maybe shoul have been paced better.Still, 'Billy' is genuinely scary. The obscene calls will make your flesh crawl and that 'eye behind the door' shot really haunts me. Easily worth watching (andthe remakeisn't as bad as you've heard either)."
3,Quite gripping and scary,"This film was made before the groundbreaker Halloween and shows that John Carpenter may have lifted one or two ideas from this movie. They don't make 'em like this anymore. It takes it's time getting there, and some scenes may seem outdated, but the thrill is there. Scary fun."
5,Don't Pass This One By.....,"This is a great horror movie. When watching it remember it was done before Halloween and the slasher films of the 80's. I am 38 and remember this movie and was thrilled to see it on DVD. The story(original at the time) still holds up, the atmosphere is creepy as hell and the acting is pretty good, especially Margot Kidder. Has some slow spots but the last part is really well paced and the ending is disturbing,if not predictable. Overall a very good movie,watch it with When A Stranger Calls for a decent theme night."
5,Great,The order came in on time and in excellent shape . I will order through this company again and again .
3,Black Christmas,wasn't as scary as I remember it being all those years ago but still LOVE seeing Olivia Hussey!!! Glad it's part of my collection.
3,incomplete story line,"This remake of Silent Night, Evil Night does not give the complete story line needed to follow the movie. Still a good classical scary movie."
2,very scary but very stupid!,"I had heard this movie was very scary so i watched it.And i thought it was dumb,the killings were fake!But the thing that saved it was the fact that it gives you nightmares.The acting was terrible.And the ending could have been a little better.If you want a movie that just scares you,then i do recommend this one.But if you are picky with acting and other things i can almost guarantee you will not be impressed with this movie!"
2,"Very slow pacing, remake is BETTER","I just recently saw this film, buying it a) because i love horror/slasher films, b) i LOVE the halloween movies and c) i really liked the remake. This 1974 version is a VERY SLOW and mind numbing movie. it takes a LONG while for anything good to happen, very small amount of blood and gore, not that many kills are fun to watch, NO nudity (unforgivable for a slasher in my book). The remake to me was a better movie(see my reveiw of that film) as it had lots of blood and gore, some nudity and acually explains who billy is and where he came from. in this movie he just goes to the house and starts killing without the veiwer ever know why. I can see the elements borrowed for Halloween and yes halloween did things 10 times BETTER then this movie. Honestly im glad i got it nfor just $8 brand new because if i wouldve paid more i wouldve hated myself. Some people love this movie,some hate it, i for one will never watch this ever again and will rather rewatch the remake."
2,Nothing Special,"I bought this movie when I heard about it over the radio. I can see why it was a breakthrough movie as far as the cinematography, but everything else about it was mediocre. You're not missing much if you never see this move."
2,ARE THEY SERIOUS????????,"OK WHAT WAS THE WRITER OF THIS MOVIE THINKING? NO PLOT, NO EXPLAINATION OF ANYTHING....WHY? IF YOU GET SCARED DURING HORROR MOVIES DONT WORRY YOULL BE FINE. THERES NOTHING TO THIS MOVIE. DONT WASTE YOUR 2 HOURS."
2,Scary??...yes.....Overrated?..yes!.....but u decide.,"Listen here goes, Black Christmas is without a doubt a landmark movie, after seeing it u will realize how many movies including Halloween copied it. My major downfall with this film is that it is way to slow,,I mean real slow, I do not think it is a top-notch horror flick, and I despise these new genre of horror/comedy films like Scream,etc... I do think I need to watch it again and then maybe my review will be different. It does have some scary parts but I just thought the killing of the women could be more of the focus in the movie, way to much soap opera like B.S.,,,,check it out ur self..u decide."
3,"Good, but not great","This movie has been hyped as the ""prequel"" to Halloween. That ideas is even pushed in the commentaries/extras. While it is a somewhat entertaining movie, it just didn't live up to the billing. The acting is rough and some parts of the movie just don't make sense. Why would the police search the town and local campus area without first completely searching the house? Bob Clark, the director, has currently been pushing this idea that Halloween was his ""idea"". And that is what brought the rating down, the last thing I want to hear on a commentary or in the extra features about a movie is how another movie that was made better and performed better was originally ""their"" idea."
2,Overrated,"BLACK CHRISTMAS is not as effective as HALLOWEEN. The killer is annoying, some gurgling lunatic who uses obscene language to get his point across. The direction and editing is weak. How many times do we have to see the woman wrapped in cellophane up in the attic...she's dead ..I get it...Move on! I wasnt routing for the characters or the killer for that matter...this movie just didnt deliver. HALLOWEEN and WHEN A STRANGER CALLS ""borrowed"" from this film and both movies were scarier!"
2,nothing speacial,It has its moments but nothing speacail could you stop the rumors that Halloween copied this if you see the documantrys on halloween they say they named it Halloween because it would be cheaper since itwill take place in one night not because Bob Clark wanted to make a sequel named Halloween so please stop making thees rumors that Halloween copied this they are just pethatic attempts to make Black Christmas more popular
2,The sum is not as great as the parts.,"Black Christmas has creepy suspense, yeah. Great buildup, sure. And those phone calls? Freaking weird.But it does not have cohesion. Or closure. A movie doesn't need those things to be good, but their absence in Black Christmas wrecks the whole ship. All that suspense and those phone-melting calls are pretty good on their own, but the anticipation of figuring out ""But who's doing it...and WHY?"" is the driving force behind the movie. And what they actually led up to? Pllllllbbbtttttt. Totally unsatisfying.It's fitting that this movie is set around the holidays, because watching it is just like opening a bunch of cool presents on Christmas morning, saving the best wrapped one for last, and then ripping it up only to find nothing inside. Black Christmas, definitely."
2,I'm Confused,"I really don't understand why so many people like this movie so much. I consider myself a pretty big horror buff, but this fell way below my standards. I thought it was boring, had weak murder scenes and had an absolutley horrible ending. There was more shots of the house mother taking nips of Mad Dog 20/20 than killing scenes. I liked the killer's dialogue though, haha, but that's about it.I can see people enjoying it somewhat, but to call it the best slasher of all time and think it's the scariest movie they ever saw is just plain upsurd."
3,Scary-entertaining BUT NOT FOR KIDS,C_nt repeatedlyF_ck repeatedlySh_t repeatedlyC_ck several timesAnd a whole lot of raw sexual inuendo.Those are the words that make this film unsuitable for children. Watch it when the kids aren't around.Also the film promotes youth rebellion against moral and parental authority and adult rebellion against police authority.It IS scary but the movie script creates it's own predictablility.And you never find out who_dunnitIt's worth watching at least once.
5,BLACK CHRISTMAS ENDING,This is a wonderful scary movie and well done. Does anyone know if Jess gets killed in the end? They sort of leave you wondering. Thanks
5,Great mid-70's Horror Flick,"I just received my copy of this movie today and I really liked it. It has a very spooky atmosphere and the Soriority house is the perfect place for the murders. The movie has u guessing to the end and unfortunately, it never properly reveal the killer but the killer's harassing phone calls are so chilling that it makes ""When A Stranger Calls"" look amateurish. To sum it up, this movie ranks up there with ""Dawn Of The Dead"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Masacre"". Definately paved the way for other less than stellar horror movies and even though it was made in 1974, it still can give u chills.A Killer on Christmas, what can be better!!!"
3,metal mania gone,"i must admit to liking some of the songs, but i think that the individual albums of these artists are better. some of the live tracks are good, but i enjoyed their regular studio albums better. not my cup of tea, but could be for other metal rockers."
2,safe,just not what i thought it would be but the company was great and took it back with no hassle. thanks
5,Excellent Disc!,"Awesome! Really enjoy this disc! I think we have a new queen of the 88's! Have friends who have seen Kelley live, and said that she puts on a great concert live as well!"
5,This is a wonderful story!,"My three girls read this book over and over again. They identify with the fear and love the way that Precious doesn't fall for the Boo Hag's tricks. It's a great story for my girls' ages: 8,9, and 11."
3,Couldn't get into it,"I enjoyed Portia, but this work, as much as I tried and all, I just couldn't get into this book. Maybe it was me, but the scenes flew from one thing to the next, I couldn't get head or tails of what was being said, so I stopped reading it."
3,Out of the Ordinary Regency,"I enjoy this book because it was a different story line for Regencies. The characters are charming. The Aunts are very funny.When Lady Greenlea is sent to London to find a husband, Mr. Carlyle follows her, afraid that the girl will choose an inappropriate alliance. This is fine with Lady Greenlea since Mr. Carlyle is the husband she wants.Lady Greenlea pretends to look for a suitable match to make Mr. Carlyle jealous and does seem to be seduced by an impoverished earl, his eccentric aunts, their bevy of pug dogs, the spectre that haunts their mansion and the ghost's treasure hidden there.This book is a little long and with a predictable outcome but it's worth reading if you like Regencies."
2,Old video hard to watch . Bad picture quality.,Bad picture quality . Colors not vivid . This is a DVD created from 1970's and found to be so boring I just shut off . Not one of the better ones on Amazon .
1,lens has a flaw,"All the L lenses that I have tested are awesome, except this one. The lens has severe front focus (about 1.5-2.5 inches depending on the copy) at around f1.8. Some people call it soft focus but it is really a front focus issue if you know how to test for it. I bought and returned four of these trying to get a good one, only to find that it is a design flaw. It exists in the majority of the series II, but often even the pros don't notice it because it only shows up at specific f stops. I wish Canon would do something about it, check out the canon reviews on the canon site for more detail."
2,just ok,"this book was not what I thought it would If you had a complete set, (of about 15 books) then it would be fine. But by it's self it is incomplete."
1,"Good message, lousy execution.","While the information provided may be engaging in a discussion after viewing, the production value of this movie is absolutely horrible. Filmed in someone's backyard, the noises of the cars and birds in the background are incredibly distracting, and the actors tend to flub their lines quite a bit. Granted, I understand that the message that is being relayed through the movie is key in understanding the role postmodernism plays in relation to therapy, but the shoddy workmanship that went into this detracts from the message. It was painful to sit through."
3,Thin coating?,"I just received this Satin Black 3.5Q Oval Oven, I noticed the knob is made of metal, and the dull Black color enamel coating is very thin or nonexist on both interior and exterior of the pot. It reminds me of a Lodge seasoned cast iron pot. I will use it to cook short ribs this weekend."
1,Wow what are the five of you listening to?,I can see why Peter Frampton said he didn't like this album! The five 5 star reviews are laughable. The production on this album is EXTREMELY generic sounding and the songs are all average at best. Peter has SO many better albums than this (most of them matter of a fact). This is a stinker if for no other reason they didn't get a good sound producer to make it even sound good. Every song has that same lousy sound to it.
3,Love Me Tender,"THIS IS ELVIS' FIRST MOVIE. IT IS NOT TO BAD AN EFFORT. ELVIS LOOKS OUT OF PLACE WITHIN THE STORY-LINE. A CIVIL WAR MELODRAMA. HE SINGS AND MOVES AS ELVIS IN 1956. WHICH IS AWSOME IN OF IT'S SELF. HIS ACTING IS AMAZINGLY GOOD FOR BEING AN AMATOUR. ON THIS RELEASE THERE IS NOTHING ADDED IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. JUST A TRAILER. TYPICAL OF PARAMOUNT, WHO SEEMS TO HAVE A DISDAIN FOR ELVIS. THE TRANSFER IS CLEAN BUT IT COULD BE BETTER. AFTER ALL IT IS A BLACK AND WHITE FILM. JUST SEE WHAT CRITERION DID FOR ""THE BANK DICK"". THIS WAS AN HISTORIC MOMENT IN POP CULTURE THAT SHOULD'VE RECEIVED A LITTLE CARE. PARAMOUNT EVEN PUT A PICTURE ON THE COVER OF ELVIS IN THE 60'S!. HOW LAME IS THAT.? BUT AT LEAST WE CAN BE GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE SOME MORE ELVIS ON DVD."
3,A singer turns to acting,"An otherwise forgettable black-and-white western that has achieved immortality as the film debut of a rock and roll singer of some note. There isn't any rock and roll on the soundtrack, but the kid with the sideburns and the curled lip belts out a quartet of nifty country flavored songs, including ""Love Me Tender,"" a charming ditty that looked to be so popular that the folks at 20th Century Fox dumped the original title (""The Reno Brothers"") and renamed the film in the song's honor. Their instincts were correct about the song and the movie: both were monster hits. The critics were not too enthused, especially about that new guy's performance, but he's actually pretty good. And no matter what anyone thought, the singer kept on singing and making movies, too. ""Love Me Tender"" is no classic, but it didn't need to be either. It achieved its purpose (to make a mint for its studio, and to send the image of its star to fans around the world) very well."
4,Very entertaining,"I enjoyed this movie very much. There are several worthwhile songs and Elvis has great chemistry with his co-stars. The title song is very memorable and for Elvis fans, this is the one where Mr. & Mrs. Presley can be seen in the final concert scenes."
2,"Content is great, VOD format is bad.","I watched this on the travel channel and loved it so much that I wanted to download and share with my family who will be visiting. First off it's DRM's so the concept of sending them a DVD doesn't exist. Next, VOD cuts off 35ish seconds too soon so you miss the ending. Audio is poor, sounds like a warped tape from the 80's. It's a pity as this was really good to watch on the travel channel."
5,Great for deterring a marking dog (on carpet),"My newly adopted female dog continues to mark in the same area of my living room carpet despite it having been professionally cleaned 2 times. I read online that cinnamon oil and eucalyptus oil deters remarking. Apparently dogs hate the smell. My dog, thus far, has not remarked the area and it has been over a week. A great improvement because I have been going through a 1.5 gallon bottle of Nature's Miracle a month ($35 cost) so I am hoping this oil continues to work! The best part is that it has a mild cinnamon scent so it doesn't smell like you are in a candle shop.I ordered from Red TAG Sale seller and it was nicely packaged for shipment. I ordered 2 bottles and the price was good."
1,Yuck - Smells Terrible,"I bought this to scent the house....I'm used to using cinnamon oil and I bought this brand for the first time due to the price. Well, you get what you pay for! I opened the bottle and there is a cinnamon scent - but also a soapy/petroleum/weird kind of scent. It's horrible. If you want a pure cinnamon scent - like you're smelling some cinnamon sticks, this is not it. Mine ended up in the trash. I'm not even sure this will do much to make the trash smell better but it's the only place it deserved being put.Update: I tried two other brands and I finally found what I was looking for. Simplers Botanicals sells Cinnamon Leaf oil. This is the best stuff - it smells exactly as you expect it too. I didn't find it on Amazon - I just did some research and found their site online at [...] . A friend said she's found their stuff in Whole Foods and Co-Ops too. It does cost a little more - but totally worth it."
4,Cinnamon Cassia Oil,"It will take some time to know ifthis product serves the purpose for which I purchased it, will have to review again in the future."
5,Magic,"I bought some of this to use in a Success Spell that I wanted to cast in preparation for an Important Job Interview. Wow! It was more potent than I had expected. Not only did I get the job, but I accidentally won the lottery, too. Now I'm rich, and have joined the Republican Party. Also, all my neighbors have fallen in love with me. (But that could be more from the lottery than the cinnamon oil.)I have also used it as an aroma therapy oil to help me fight off Lyme's Disease. It worked great; not only did my Lyme Disease go away but it also cured a nasty foot fungus that I had acquired while on an epic Spiritual Quest in the jungles of Bolivia, where they call this aciete de cannela. I thought I was going to have to live with that funky smell for another hundred years!It also tastes great when added to muffins; just be careful not to use too much or the taste will be too strong and it could cause your Chakras to get all out of whack.All in all I give this product five pentacles!"
5,Wild Second; vivid Serenade!,"Svetlanov was, together with Mravinsky the most remarkable conductors in the vanished U.S.R.R.But dislike Mravisnki, his approach was less intellectual and much more volcanic. The way he achieved from the orchestra these wild crescendos, astonishing fortissimos din't blur his aristocratic gaze around any single work he conducted.In particular, in what Tchaikovsky he will never bore you, because he will have something to say: Imagination, flair, taste and superb good taste; supreme elegance and excel refinement at the moment to phrase and underline any particle of the score.His importance since his death (2002) has been exponentially growing.Don't miss this album."
4,Thumbs-up for amish dolls,Esy to follow instructions mingled with a bit of Amish history. Looks fairly easy for intermediate sewer or above.
5,CUTE GUY + AWSOME VOICE = GREAT CD,"THIS CD WAS THE BOMB! AARON HAS THE GREATEST VOICE IN THIS! ESPECIALLY IN ""I WANT CANDY"". THIS OUT OF 5 STARS SHOULD BE 10!"
1,Are u Serious?,"I can't beleive people actual pay money for this CD, the only reason Aaron is at all famous is because of Nick. People say that he's 12 and that the songs he sings about aren't too old for him,but over half the stuff he's singing about has probably never happened to him. A hint to Aaron: wait till your older and can get a little more respect, look what happened to Shirely Temple."
4,Let kids have their idols!,"Kids (especially girls) are ga-ga over Aaron - let them have their idols!! We saw Aaron on Broadway in Seussical and his adoring fans (mostly young girls) were lining the street to see him. Obviously, this isn't an adult CD, it's something that kids can identify with. Remember the Brady Bunch? They were far from talented singers, but we loved them in the 70's. My 9-year old girl loves Aaron and hopefully he'll remain a healthy role model. You Go, Aaron!"
1,Everything That Is Wrong With Music Today,"You're kidding me, right? If this is the kind of music that companies are signing today, music must really be dead. The only reason someone would actually buy this album is because they think the little runt is cute. You're only fooling yourself if you think this is good music. The only reason this kid's famous is b/c of his BSB brother Nick. This kid's influences (brother Nick, BSB, NSync, etc) have little to no talent, so naturally he's much worse. If you do decide to buy this, look deep down inside your soul and ask yourself, ""Why? Why would I, in the right mind, buy a CD of a 12-year-old kid doing his impressions of what he !thinks! (keyword ""thinks"") is rap music and street talk?!?! Avoid this at all costs. Buy something else instead."
1,Another Kids Bop Album,"Aaron's Party by Aaron Carter is a childish attempt to making a music CD. The CD is basically a child's album that was attempted to be made for teenagers. This disc is a weak attempt at a rap album and the artist sounds like a twelve year old girl. The lyrics are juvenile and some songs have been stolen from artist of the past. The album includes many interludes and the amount of talking that is done in the album takes away from the music itself. The artist has attempted to make the album into a rap version of pop songs. An example of one song that sounds very juvenile is called ""How I beat Shaq"", it's a young boy's fantasy on how he beat a major basketball star at his own game. The song includes many other children yelling and trying to rap but the song sounds very mixed and very unprofessionally edited."
1,Sad,"This is the worst cd in the history of music. Not only is this kid like 3 years old, hes white and trying to rap and dance. His lyrics are so badly written and sadly anyone could write them. I cant believe music has come to this. Im sorry for all the 12 year old girls who like this and are offended by this but im sorry 3 year old white boys rapping just isnt cool."
5,Great Music!!!!!!,His music really rocks. It means stuff to me. The music is the best. It really gets to me. Most stuff I like is because it sounds good but yet it means nothing. Right now this is my favorite c.d.
1,COMPLETE STOW AWAY!,"This kid is known only as nick carter's brother, and that's all he'll ever be known as. This CD has nothing but songs you might hear on Barney. Like his older brother, he can't sing without whining and his ego is almost as big as his inevitable career failure."
5,Aaron Carter - the Little Prince Of Pop,"I rate this CD from my first opinion about it 6 years ago. I've had a lot of fun dancing to this album! It's really fun and ""alive"", also there are some interludes with Aaron and friends talking - and this, I think, works out great. One of the best songs on this album is ""That's How I Beat Shaq"" - it's all around fun! But, of course, the CD is not for grown-ups or kids who have passed 12. But if you're 12 or younger - go and get this album right now! You will have a lot of fun growing up with this CD. Aaron's 6th album ""Saturday Night"" is supposed to be out sometime this year (2006), and I must admit: I CAN'T WAIT!!! It's going to be very exciting to see how Aaron has grown and matured since this CD. Keep going, AC! You've got my support - no matter what!!!"
1,Oh my gosh-this is MUSIC?! Just a kid with no talent.,"Ok-it's not music. It has no genre. Pop, no, he is way worse than that. It's just some ordinary kid spitting out some meaningless words getting a chance to make a record only because he's the brother of B.S.B. Nick Carter(who isn't half as good.)How 'bout this, Aaron. Lets have a ""Party,"" and I'll have some real music, and you can ""Come Get It""Gosh, ""music"" these days. Phew! These companies can't be THIS desparate?Don't be fooled-I would never even consider buying anything like this. I listened to it from someone I know.Bottom line-If you have it, thow it out. It's not even good enough for a kindergartner sing-a-long.Hope you don't buy it,The Advice GiverSave your money, and buy-Lifehouse-No Name FaceAlanis Morrisette-Jagged Little Pill"
1,And i Thought Vanilla Ice was terrible...,"I'm just telling everybody that If you really want to see young talent get a hold of Lil Bow Wow..He's a lot more professional, his lyrics flow much nicer, and most of the stuff he sings about probably has happened to him..."
2,Blah....,"This cd is good if your under 11, and just want to listen to some fun music that really is (cheesy).But, if your any older, and looking for creative lyrics and some meaningful music coming from this cd, you'll probably laugh (or cry) when you listen to it."
3,review of Aaron's Party,"I think the only reason Aaron Carter is famous is because he is Nick's brother. He's not a bad singer-will be better when his voice matures. The lyrics are basically awful. But the tunes and his voice are pretty okay. There are a few really okay songs on here: ""Real Good Time"" ""Girl You Shine"" & ""Bounce."" Some of them are a waste like ""Iko Iko"" and ""Tell Me What You Want."" He was a cute little boy on his previous CD's, now, he's basically filling time. Give Aaron a few years; he'll probably do better."
1,Seriously,"Anyone who admits to owning, liking, or listening to this should be ashamed of themselves.Worst music on the planet."
3,A Golden Boy,"Will AARON CARTER finally be able to step out of big brother Backstreet Boy's ...shadow? Perhaps not but at least he tries to be different. Little Carter's first American release is a cute blend of hip hop and pop with infectious tunes perfect for your junior pop fan. Only 13, his voice is still a little weak but he shows definite talent just waiting to be refined. This album is a fun party mix filled with fun interludes between the songs. Take a listen to ""Aaron's Party"", ""Iko Iko"" and his own version of the old hit ""I Want Candy"". Pick it up for your kid sister/brother..."
1,"Hey look, Alvin ditched Simon and Theadore to go solo","My Internet Girl? Stupid... Well folks, here's yet another pretty kid for the superficial preteens of America to gush over. He's not too young, not too old... and not too talented. What does this little kid (try to) ""rap"" about? Overdue library books and report cards? Him and his little buddies chillin' in a kiddy-pool? Ridiculous..."
1,What are you people thinking?,"I don't own this CD, but thank goodness I don't. I heard a clip of a couple of the songs and I wanted to ask you people...WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? I'm sure Aaron appeals to pre-adolesent 10 year olds, but I'm fourteen and all I'm saying is ""uhh...no."" I""m sorry to any of you who LIKE him, but for any of you NOT into that sorta thing, don't bother."
2,"You're kidding me, right?","If your over the age of 12... then this is definitely not a CD for you. Filled with remakes of 50s/60s songs and a few new ""jams"", this CD makes you laugh more than anything else. Aaron Carter is a product of his record company. He has no say whatsoever as to what he sings or how the music sounds. Basically they hand him a sheet, say ""sing this"", and he does it. They ask him to smile... snap a few photos... go on a few TV shows and WHAM! your a star. There are a lot more harder working musicians who you should spend you money on. Let Aaron grow up and then maybe he should try again."
1,I'm not going to aaron's party!,"Perfect CD for a 5 year old's birthday party. The songs are so cheesy that you feel sorry for Aaron. He has no talent and his voice sounds like a girl. Why did Nick bother getting him a record deal? If Nick wasn't famous nobody would've thought twice about giving Aaron a record deal. I mean, GET REAL."
2,wont the carter's let one of their kids finish high school?,"Wow. What a waste. I'll start off by saying this cd should be in the dollar store under the coaster section. Aaron has no talent (yet, even though I hate pop music), his lyrics are aweful, and they should've at least waited for him to hit puberty before they let him start singing(don't get me started on his rapping ""skillz""). I'm not bashing young rock stars (Billy Gilman can actually sing pretty good), but Aaron's voice is like the sound barrier being broken 3 feet away from your ears. If you like Rap/Hip-Hop try Jurassic 5, Black Eyed Peas, and Wu Tang. And even if you like BSB or other boybands, you'll probably still think this is a steaming load."
4,Aaron definitely knows how to keep a party goin'!,"Okay, I must confess--I'm an Aaron Carter fan. I am 20 years old, and I like Aaron Carter. But hey--he's a cute kid, and he's got some really great material on his new album! Now, if you're looking for music with some deep philosophical message, try some of Sting's older stuff. If you want pop music that you can sing along with and dance to, this is what you need! I was a little disappointed that there are no slow songs on the album whatsoever, but hey, it's pop. Turn it up and have fun!"
4,Cute for kids,"When I bought this, my daughters loved him. Now they gag at his music. It was just a faze."
4,Not Bad For Someone Just Starting Out,"This isn't a half-bad album by Aaron Carter. While this isn't in my CD player as much as it used to be, this is still a really good album, considering Aaron's age at the time. As an Aaron Carter and Backstreet Boys fan, I feel it is necessary to collect at least some of their CD singles but all of their CD's (the US released ones anyway). I happen to like some of the Interludes on here, but there are too many in which Aaron and friends use the telephone. Other wise, I thought this was pretty good."
2,So now singers can start their career as toddlers?,"How old was Aaron Carter when his producers had him make this CD? He looks like he could stand to go back to kindergarten basically. His voice sounds like a newborn crying, and his songs are written by little kids probably between the ages of 6 and 9."
4,He's a kid,"This CD is music by a kid, for kids. My 7 year old daughter loves Aaron. Don't understand all the hype and negative reviews. If you don't want kid/teenie bopper music...don't buy it. He doesn't appeal to me either...but my daughter has a blast dancing and singing to his music. Good for him! and good for her! Wish I had the talent and ability when I was his age. Wish I had it now! Go Aaron!"
1,WARNING!,"...Maybe I am more conservative than some; however, songs that suggest it is fun to have a party when your parents are not home, or suggestive songs about a 12 year old ""wanting"" a girl named Candy, go too far for a 7 year old little girl to listen to. This music, while seeming harmless, takes on a different look at closer monitoring. I would not buy this CD for anyone younger than 14. Borderlines on sexually suggestive."
1,What?,Does Aaron Carter think he can rap? This is absolute trash no matter which way you look at it!
4,You should really Come Get This!!!,"This is the first CD of Aaron Carter I ever heard.I really enjoyed this a lot.This music is great and fun to dance to. Give this CD a chance.1. Aaron's Party (Come Get It) 9/10 Really fun to dance to.2. I Want Candy 10/10 One of my favorites.3. Bounce 10/10 Enjoyed it.4. Internet Girl 5/10 Not the best.5. That's How I Beat Shaq 10/10 The best song on here!6. The Clapping Song 3/10 Not very good.7. Iko/Iko 10/10 A great song.8. Real Good Time 9/10 A really nice song9. Tell Me What You Want 10/10 A fun song10. Girl You Shine 10/10 Go Aaron, Go Aaron!!!"
3,Okay!,"Hmm,my copy of this CD had a scratch when I got it from my friend Diana so I never really heard alot of the songs. Basicly the only songs by him I really like are ""I want Candy"" and ""Oh,Aaron""(I got that CD from a cereal box but I really liked it). But mostly the only reason to buy this CD is for the interlude thingys,they are ALOT better then the songs."
4,"Pretty Good CD, Not Aaron's Best","Aaron's Party is a good CD, but not Aaron's greatest. (I liked Oh Aaron much better) The songs are pretty good, with my favorites being ""Aaron's Pary (Come Get It)"", ""Bounce"", and ""My Internet Girl"". There are interludes at the end of some tracks which are a bit annoying, oh well."
2,"Oh, come on..","Aaron is a somewhat respectable performer... if you have ever seen the little kids go crazy over him, you'd understand. His newer CD's are actually somewhat OK, but this one can really hurt the ears. Especially considering his voice has not even sprung to maturity in this album. I consider, if you really want some of his music, get one of his newer CDs."
2,Aaron's Party is good but Needs Improvement,"One star for techno and style and one star for vocals. The little brother of Backstreet Boy Nick Carter is following his older brother's footsteps. Don't get me wrong, Aaron Carter is a good singer because little kids aged from 8-14 admire him because his songs give it a ""techno kiddie"" feel. (Come Get It and Candy are ok for the little ones) This album seems to be designed for that age group but minus one star for not writing the songs, minus another for undeserved popularity, and minus another star for Aaron Carter being almost foolish to challenge the music industry through his kiddie pop tunes. Hey, Aaron's just a little guy but he'll get there if he can just try to meet these standards."
3,The kid is allright,"Yeah, neither Aaron nor his brother will ever be a threat to Pavarotti, but what pop singers are? He's an appealing kid who sings as well as he can, and imho does pretty well for a 12 year old. I'm sure his family connections have helped his start in show biz, but that's not unheard of. People looking to buy this album probably have a general idea of what to expect, and for kid pop, it's pretty good. Don't, as some reviewers seem to, hate Aaron for not being eminem or limp bizkit."
3,what is this garbage?,"OMG, this is the future of pop music? The only good song is ""I Want Candy"" and it's a remake from Bow Wow Wow.I caught his concert on Disney Channel last nite and it was OK. He's a cute kid and all and he has some good dance moves, but the lyrics to most of his songs are lame. I think we are better off sticking with his brother's band, BSB."
1,Absolutely Not.,"I'd rather stick a potato peeler up my nose and twist it instead of listening to another minute of this styrafoam pop from boy wonder Aaron Carter (brother of BSB's Nick). Everything on this album is bad: songwriting, vocals, and production. The difference between this and a bag of Cheetos is that the former comes in a CD and the latter comes in a bag. But both are made of cheese."
4,Very good,"Well, I must admit that when I first heard about this CD I was a little skeptical, but for a 12 year old boy he did a fabulous job wtih this CD. He had a large hole to fill after his brother, Nick, carved a reputation of exellence in to the face of music, and he scored a perfect 10."
1,this music [stinks],"don't buy this horrible noise..hes basically riding the coattails of his brothers success in BSB.get some real music like: the smiths, the cure, david bowie, spacemen 3, jesus and mary chain, pink floyd, guns n roses, velvet underground, kiss, my bloody valentine, bronski beat, talking heads, and some other bands with talent.please ignore the whole pop scene of 99-01 and find some real music...its already fading away (thank god), so hope you found the review helpful."
1,Oh come on!,"What does anybody see in this little boy with no talent? First of all, he wouldn't even have a record contract if it wasn't for his brother. Second of all he can't sing worth two cents. The only time I have ever seen him perform was on the Rosie O'Donnell show. He lip-synched the entire thing and very badly too. But you would think that if it's lip-synched that the vocals must sound good. Not so. His voice is high, squeaky, flat, and just doesn't sound good. He dresses like one of the New Kids on the Block. The material on his albums are completely meaningless. Why buy this album when you can buy something of quality? Go buy Shania Twain. Throw Aaron Carter in the trash."
1,COME GET IT--IN THE TRASH!!,"This has got to be one of the worst musicians ever! Wait, did I say MUSICIAN? Aaron Carter cannot even rap, let alone make good music. Most of the songs he uses anyway are remakes of ones from the 50s and 60s, but done in a crappy way. And what's with his retarded song, ""That's How I Beat Shaq""? If that were really happening, Shaq would've thrown Aaron's a** across the basketball court and then dunked him head first through the basketball hoop. Seriously, somebody shut this kid up!"
1,"If you are ill, do not listen to this album!","Just grateful I didn't pay for this one. I thought I would listen to this album as a joke. Not only is this material non original, Carter sounds like a little girl. Annoying."
1,"""uh..... "" is right","My niece was playing this the other day... I suddenly realized how late it was, and that I should really be going. Honestly... it made me wish my nephew had won the argument and gotten to play his Ricky Martin disc instead. Still, and all, it got me thinking, later that night. I blame my family for a lot of things. But one thing I will always be eternally grateful to them for is my musical prefernces. My Emerson record player was always well-stocked with the likes of Pete Seeger's ""Children's Concert at Town Hall"", ""The Beatles 1967-1970"", or ""Songs of the Civil War"". I would gladly listen to any of those today. I had my low points, yes - there was a time when I thought Hall & Oates and Duran Duran were the bee's knees (hey, it was 1982), but, getting to the point, it's kind of distressing to think that this is what kids go nuts for today. I think I need to remind my brother that when I was his daughter's age, he was giving me ""Led Zeppelin IV"" for Christmas."
3,Probally the best music I have ever heard!,This was terrific! His music is great and really easy to dance to. Aaron is much better than Nick. I know he got famous off of him but Aaron definatly has his own beat. I would recommend it for ages 10+ definatly for girls.
2,THIS SUCKED!!,"I bought this CD and I am highly disappointed with it. There are not any good songs on it. I got really annoyed with most of the songs, and I shrill when I hear his voice now."
5,I LOVE POWER METAL!!!!!,ths is one of the best pwoer metal albums ever it's even better than stratovarious i wish erin cartman was more popular because he's real progh not liek tool and modest mouse they suck this is awesome it's almost as good as micheal botlon powr metal 4evr!!!!!!
1,yeah let's party!,Party? What the hell kind of party does this guy have? Oh no I spilled grape juice on my moms new carpet. Go cry you sissy. This album is a disgrace to the music race. Buy something that actually involves talent like silverchair or Rage. This stinks.
1,How can people fall for this?,"First of all Aaron Carter is the worst in the ""teen pop"" marketing strategy. He has no talent, has no punch-packed dope rhymes and have writers that are about as clever as my 3-year old sister's socks. (No offensing the writers.) OK, I made a merciless diss to him and it is actually clever. Please avoid this album at all costs. Buy wisely for this Christmas. Happy Holidays.PS There IS a good point on the album, ""That's How I Beat Shaq,"" which does have a catchy beat but who cares cause HE TALKS IN THE SONG!!!"
1,Squeaky Voice,"My little brother paid 13.98 for this CD at Wal-Mart 3 weeks ago and sold it at our yard sale for 2.50 1 week later. TAKE A Hint. Aaron has a voice as squeaky as a little girl age 8, and his songs are just soooooo cool, ha ha ha."
1,I could write better lyrics,"Wow! Some punk a year younger than me with a Backstreet Boy as a brother decides to create a musical masterpiece with the greatest lyrics ever! Forget Tool! Forget Rage Against the Machine! I don't care about how corrupt our capitalistic society is, or how many people are killed on the Mexican border. I just want to hear about a buncha drunk primates or having an online relationship!Aw, who am I kidding? Being in a REAL rock band myself, I can say that even with my limited life experiance (the people who write Aaron's lyrics are probably in their 30's), I can write and sing much better than Aaron Carter (or his songwriters). Aaron should realize that he can't rap, and give up on music as a career."
1,No Way,"This is not Joseph, this is his youngest daughterAaron Carter is... well... what is aaron carter? I'll start off by saying that AARON CARTER CANT SING. i'm not saying this because i hate him but i'm saying it because after listening to his CD i thought for a second that i was being punished. Paying money for this crap is unbelievable. Sometimes girls, you need to look past a loveable face and face the music no matter how dreadful it is.Aaron carter is a branch off of the talented Nick Carter (his older brother) without the talented part."
2,It could have been better....,"I was hoping for a really sweet cd (cuz Aaron is a sweet kid) but the only song I liked was ""Aaron's Party (Come Get It)"" and soon I got bored of that song. Then it's just another CD that sits in the back of my CD holder-totally useless. I advise not to get it."
1,Oh no,"Not another Nickelodeon promoted .... There are only 2 and I repeat 2 reasons why this guy gets ANY recongnition, one reason would be Nickelodeon and the other reason would be his BSB brother Nick. ""I Want Candy""? Come on, I bet a 1st grader could come up with equally intellingent (if not more intelligent) lyrics than that. The singing is bad, the songwriting is bad, nothing here is worth wasting your time on. The only people this appeals to would have to be 7th and 8th grade girls. Avoid this and most of the ""pop"" music over the last few years and go listen to a Guns N' Roses, Ozzy Osbourne CD, or any other band with talent."
1,The Little Prince Of Pop????,"Whatever talent this young man has, it's certainly not exhibited in this album. With an endless supply of money from 12 year old girls, this mediocre at best album has become a mega hit. Some of his lyrics are questionable, and the story lines of his videos are not appropriate for younger viewers, who by the way, are his biggest fans. It's amazing how far you can go with a big brother in the business."
1,THIS CD IS GARBAGE!,"This CD is a joke! This is like some 3 year old trying to be 'cool' by a pathetic attempt at being a rapper. I,m surprised that 17 year olds can even listen to this junk. It's virtually unlistenable retching noise!End Of Story!Don't buy this junk! Get some Amethystium, Underworld, or anything by Enigma.That's all I have to say."
4,"Tight Album, much love to Aaron.","He's 13 now, and his voice has matured more. im proud that he's made it this far, even after being under Nick's wing for years. Congrats, Aaron! Ur doing awesome for a 13 yr old, especially with all those peeps hating U. There just jealous, many people couldnt make it to where you are, and ur still going! Keep it up, and keep SHINING!"
1,"Yes, that's right!","I agree with you, Dan! We are not jelouse excuse me jealous. What makes you think anyone over 5 is jealous of this little turd. Someone keep this kid from singing. The person who gave him a recording contract should be dragged into the middle the street and put a knife down their throat. Just because his big brother is famous, doesn't necessarily mean he will be. If his brother's fame fades, I will not feel too sorry! If you are looking for coasters, here is some."
1,Lame,"There isnt one song on this cd I like in fact i dont even like Aaron. I think the only reason he wrote a couple of pathetic songs and got them put on a cds is because he had connections from his brother Nick. If u like Aaron Carter,stop and if you dont like his dont start."
1,uuuuuh please,get a life. my radio sounds better than aaron carter.... my radio is broken!!!!!!!!!!my favorite part of the album is when it's over!he thinks he's rapping!get a life
2,aaron carter CANNOT sing!!!,"i don't know why aaron carter thinks hes so good, he can't even sing right he sounds like a chipmunk. all squeaky. And also he's trying to get famous off his brother (who CAN sing) and who worked hard to get famous! But aaron doesn't deserve it. he did nothing, all people know him as is oh yeah Nick's little bro. thats all. he needs to work harder to get himself a good rep, not just taking part of Nick's fame! this cd is really boring if you want to know the truth, all the songs sounds the same (in a bad way cuz they all stink)"
4,This is fun music for kids 7 - 10 .,"This is a great, vibrant and energized bubblegum mix of music for young children - my 7 year old has had it for over a year and still loves it. My neighbor, as a result, plans on getting it for her 8 and 6 year old girls because they love it as well. The writer before me was OBVIOUSLY writing a joke of some sort about the album, a poor joke at that."
3,It's Okay,"I have had this TV for about three years though it's only used for games, not watching TV. So far it works fine, sound could be better and the picture quality is not as sharp as you would like."
1,Piece of Crap,"Well, if all you want is something the equivalent of an oversized computer monitor... go for it.The remote & side panel buttons will die within six months due to achingly crappy quality control during manufacturing. The picture will still work fine, so if you're using something else to provide audio you're good... oh, and something else to change channels, too.Definitely NOT worth $200, or even $100, except as a computer monitor."
1,Can't transfer to computer or my ipod player,When I load this CD into my computer to load on itunes it says its a dvd and can't transfer to itunes. Now I can't play on ipod.
5,My Review,"I'd like first to correct Mr. Seb Jarakian ""beatzblog.com"" ... Fadel Shaker is Lebanese, Not Egyptian ..This is the best volume of the series (even surpasses Volume 4) .. HIGHLY Recommended ...."
4,"Adding to Review posted in March, 2006","I fully concur with the comments of the reviews. I would like to identify the Boy's choir. It was called the Columbus Boychoir and was, at that time, under the direction of Herbert Huffman. The choir has flourished since then and is now called The American Boychoir."
3,"Fast, Light, but not without flaws","Pros: You can setup and breakdown this tripod in seconds (all quick-lock legs, very light), it's very light, so if you're lugging it around downtown for an afternoon, you'll be thankful you have this.Cons: Joints aren't extraordinarily smooth, and have a tendency to stick a little. The camera base tilt adjust sits at about -10deg when not tight, instead of a flat 0deg or 90deg (for landscape or portrait). Heavier kits will make the tripod pretty unstable (I'm not keen on putting my 70-200mm L with my Rebel XT on it).Overall, it's a decent portability-focused tripod, for use when you just want to run out, setup and shoot. In that sense, it serves as a decent second or third tripod, but definitely not a primary."
3,Flimsy,"I liked the light weight and how it deployed so quickly. Took many nice shots with it, but it didn't take long for the tripod to break. It's definitely not recommended for use as a primary tripod."
1,Very flimsy don't buy it,I also have a problem with the base of the tripod head. It doesn't sit level at 0 degree when not tightened and it's impossible to tighten it.I have a Canon 20D with a 16-35mm lens (considered very light) and the base cannot even support the weight such that it collapses and ends up tilting about 10 degree. It's made of cheap plastic and always loose. There is a little screw underneth the base to adjust it but it doesn't really work. You can just wobble it with little pressure by your fingers.This tripod has brought shame to Canon. I am hoping Canon doesn't make their cameras the way they build this tripod.
2,I should'a read the reviews more closely,"This is what I should have paid attention to:""Sure enough, the very first time using the tripod a tiny little piece on one of the plastic snaps that keeps the legs anchored to the center pole broke, allowing the leg to flop around freely with no bracing.""Mine arrived today, nicely packed ... and with that little piece pre-broken at the leg end, not the center pole end.Gee Mom, I'd rather have broken it myself. Needed (note past tense) it for an awards banquet on 31 January. I have great faith in Canon, was gonna put my new Canon digital camera on top of it. I have gambled, and asked for a replacement, not a refund. I neither want nor expect a high end tripod at ~$40. I do expect it to arrive intact, and last a couple of years of infrequent use before it breaks.Keep watching this space! I will report on the delivery speed, and physical integrity, of the replacement."
3,Flimsy,"Purchased this in January 2006.I liked the light weight and how it deployed so quickly. Took many nice shots with it, but it didn't take long for the tripod to break. It's definitely not recommended for use as a primary tripod."
3,Good bang for the buck.,"For the price, you can't get a better photography tripod - look elsewhere if you wanna do video, though.Firm, lightweight, easy to use. The cons are the horrible bag (get another one), whose handle is simply impossible to use; and the fact that it's not designed for video (the movements are not swift, it is designed to stay still)."
4,operates better then expected,I am by no means the professional claiming vast knowledge regarding tripods. Basically I'm a weekend warrior filming grand-children's sporting events and family gatherings. I do however know a thing or two about smooth operation. I was prompted to look for another tripod when the one I had caused small minute jerking when moving vertical. ( up & down ). These small jerks played out big time on the film being shot with my HD Camera. The cannon deluxe 200 is very smooth horizontally as well as Vertically. I gave this item 4 star rating because of my own experience. For the money this particular tripod is a home run for me. I would recommend this product.
5,Excellent tripod for great price,"This is the first tripod I have ever had. I have seen some others from my friends and this one is one of the best you can have for 30 bucks. It looks very nice and not cheap at all. And the poles are bigger than most of the tripods I have seen - which means more stable. It's also had bubble level (in the description it doesn't say that when some others' have, so in the beginning I thought that this one doesn't have bubble level. But it might be standard for all tripods). I'm very happy with my tripod. Don't go for some junk 10-buck tripods, spend some more money and you don't regret for your purchase."
1,Piece of junk,"I was extremely disappointed by this tripod. First, the base isn't level! If you set the legs so that the level reads that you're on level ground, the camera is actually tilted to the left about 5-10 degrees! And no amount of tightening it seems to get mine to sit straight.Furthermore, after just a few months of use the head cracked making it impossible to adjust it. I've superglued it back together and it's OK for now, but who knows how long it will hold up?You definitely get what you paid for with this product - which is to say, not much."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TRIPOD,"This is a throw away tripod. There are no replacement parts available through Canon or anywhere else, according to my local camera shop. This includes the easiest part of a tripod to lose, the quick shoe/mount that attaches the camera to the tripod."
1,Crank has issues/ Head broke off,"The first time I used this tripod I didn't know whether or not I broke it or it just had a horrible crank set up. The top piece (basically the neck) of the tripod kept collapsing down even after I cranked it to increase its height.Also one day while working for a client I set my tripod against one of the walls, it tipped over, and the head broke off.Must have been really cheap plastic for it to have just broke off so easily.I went looking for a warranty in the box or online and apparently cannon doesn't have a warranty for their tripods.So now I have a $40 + s&h; tripod that has a broken crank and the head snapped off of it. The lifespan of my tripod was 2 months tops.I would not recommend this tripod nor any tripod from cannon."
4,Great tripod,Tripod is great. Works smoothly. Only drawback is the length when fully broken down is a little long and I ended up packing it in my suitcase. My concern was that it might end up in getting a bend in one of the legs making it less smooth to set up and or/crooked. It made the trip okay but this issue will be an ongoing concern unless I purchase some really tough hardsided luggage.
1,this tripod is trash,"Tripod shipped from Amazon on Jan 5 2010 on Mar 15, 2010 plastic head on tripod broke in two dumbing the camera to the floor. Cannon web site lists a 1 year warranty for ""hardware"" called Canon and was told there is no warranty for tripod. Sent email including link to page that listed 1 year and was told no warranty for tripod. Net result Tripos lasted approximately 2 months, failure mode caused camera to fall to floor and Canon response is sorry for inconvience but to warranty (Just trying to get service for tripod).My last Canon product"
4,Canon Tripod,This is a great beginner camera tripod. Perfect to use this for all those shots that require a long exposure time.
4,"a doctor's review of ""Nature's Magic""","""Nature's Magic"" is a DVD designed to promote relaxation and it does so very effectively with peaceful images of wildlife and plants, relaxation- directed classical music and occasional poetry. It is as beautiful disc and well worth the asking price.As a not too scientific experiment, I measured my blood pressure before and after watching twenty minutes of the disc and found drops in both systolic and diastolic pressures. Since my blood pressure is essentially normal, I would project a much greater effect on those folks with elevated blood pressure.""Nature's Magic"" is both a treat and a treatment."
4,Latin physical comedy with a gen-x sensibility.,"I really liked the comic timing of the unknown latin actors. This is a scenario often told, but not like this.The production value was a little on the low side, but the off-the-wall dialogue and physical comedic timing, more than made up for it. I look forward to seeing the next projects from the young actors and Bahia Productions."
4,Fake but Fabulous,"From a previous review:""These concert radio broadcasts of Mravinsky's Shostakovich Symphonies 6 and 12 are vital, searing, dramatic readings in good sound for their period. The 6th Symphony was recorded in 1955 and the 12th in 1962.""All true - except the ""radio broadcast"" part. The 6th *was* live, but from Moscow 1972; the 12th a 1961 studio recording, also from Moscow and with a few audience noises added to it.It's still Mravinsky, and it's more likely that Czech Radio (or an individual there) duped ""Le Chant du Monde"" (licensing recordings they had no right to license) than the French label the customer, but it's curious, to say the least.Still riveting performances to be had, though inferior in sound (but not as bad as a DSCH 5th from the same label, same conductor, and equally misattributed.[...]"
5,Nice Portable Magnifier!,"I just acquire this item and I can say this is a great tool for bible students who helps to read the passages more meticulously. Also is good for fine print books. Anyone who has low vision, this can not miss in the bookshelf. Highly Recomended and Good Quality Easy to Carry Inside The Book!"
1,"Useful, but Poor Quality and an old edition to boot","I ordered and received this reference work in November, 2007 only to find that the binding was so poor that the page signatures literally fell out.Adding insult is the fact that the edition Amazon sent me is an old one, although the publisher, Boydell and Brewer, lists the new edition on their website and has since April, 2007 before I ordered from Amazon. I was never given a choice of an old or new edition. The difference, of course, is the price: the newer is $10 more and is the same as the list price from the publisher. The only savings is free shipping.A caveat: before ording anything from Amazon, check with the publisher first to ensure you're getting the latest edition. As for the book itself, I'm confident it will be useful and worth the money once I've gotten one that holds together!"
5,Can't go wrong with Collin Raye!,We are definitely enjoying this album of love songs. As usual we can understand all the words and love listening to his great voice.
4,Great ablum,"I only bought this ablum because I am a die-hard Collin Raye fan. True, his ballads are remarkable, but come on just buy his Direct Hit and you get his greatest songs."
4,Good lens but is it really worth $390?,"I use this lens at work every day, and in general it's a very good lens. The optics are sharp, and the focus, athough not fast, is not something to complain about.The only problem I have is that for $400 for a 20-35mm lens that's f/3.5 is a little pricey in my view. It's also not the sharpest lesn on the market, and when you can spend a another $200 for some 17-85mm IS I find it hard to justify buying this lens for the asking price."
4,"For devoted fans, this is a treasure trove...","Erasmo Carlos was a '60s teenybobber idol in Brazil's ""jovem guarda"" rock scene, who went on to sing romantic ballads like his costar, Roberto Carlos. His later work is gathered in this immense, 15-CD set, which I have to confess I'm a little afraid of. It picks up his story in 1971, skipping most of the teenybopper stuff, and plows through to the 1990s. Included are three special discs, one of rarities, another of duets with various guest artists and a third of songs sung in Spanish. For true fans only, I'd wager. (Although if the folks who control the RGE catalog wanted to (hint, hint) put out a box set of his earlier albums from the '60s, I'd be way into that...!!)"
3,jelly,"Good, but not much of a bite to it. If you like the flavor of Jalapeno without the bite, this is for you."
2,Not as hot as I thought it would be,"I had some Jalapeno Jelly with some Cream Cheese and Crackers at a party. I asked what it was and they told me Jalapeno Jelly. I could not find any in a local grocery, so I looked on-line and found some at Amazon. It was reasonably priced and looked good. It does have a good flavor, it just was not as tangy and the one I had before. I really thought it would have more kick to it."
4,"4 good movies, 3 great ones, and one bad one.","I will start off talking about the movie I was let down by. It was ""Phantom of the Opera"". Big fans of opera music will injoy that one. Big horror fans like myself will find it lame. I hate opera music and this flim as alot more in it then is needed. The really old, classic, silent one is the one to see.""Frankenstien"", ""Dracula"", and ""The Invisible Man"" are my favorites out of this package and are some of my favorite horror movies of all time(along with ""The Exorcist"", ""Evil Dead"", ""Jaws""), and are ture landmarks of the genre.""Dracula"" has not lost its chill over the years, and ""The Invisible Man"" and ""Frankenstien"" have not thier important meaning.The other horror movies in this package are good, but I did not love them like I hoped I would."
3,Reluctantly bought it,"I wish that this wasn't a collection and that the individual titles were released. It is much easier to organize them in my DVD library that way. Still, I bought it."
3,Price - are they kidding?,"Great classic movies, certainly. A great nostalgia product for those of us old enough to remember watching them syndicated in the early 60's on 'Shock Theater' or whatever your local tv channel called it.But $159 MSRP? They've gone to the well on these one time too many for me. If the prices drops (a LOT) I'll pick it up."
1,Why now DVD format?,Many computers still only play DVD. Why is there no option for DVD format? I know I sound like an old fart in saying that but I like the option.
1,Eh.,"Look at the box set (slipcase) that Universal released these films on DVD in 2000. You'll see they were - in a couple of cases, at least - too lazy to put new photos of the characters on this one. Just flipped the photos of Lugosi and Rains as Invisible and Phantom, used the same of Karloff's Monster. That and the fact that all the extras were ported over from the DVDs, and that these blu-ray discs hold a HECK of a lot more data - it adds up that Universal rushed this together to get it on the shelves for Halloween. Seems to me that if the studio had any real respect for these films they'd have gone the extra mile for them, or at least the admirable job they did on JAWS. As for these, no thanks."
3,Upgraders be-aware...,"Upgrading to Blu for these Classic Universal Monsters, once again I feel Hoodwinked and dissapointed with what's missing. Yeah, OK Movies are crisp and improved, however all extras are not transferred from UCM Legacy Collection Box Set. Missing are the extra Movies, for example: The Blu Collection does not include Werewolf of London, Frankenstein Meets Wolf Man,on Wolfman Blu-ray disc. Creature from Black Lagoon Blu doesn't include Revenge of Creature, or Creature Walks Among Us. Invsible Man Blu missing,...Returns,Revenge... Sooooo Hang on to your Legacy Collection if you decide to ""trade up"" to BR and like these sequels. Why other reviewers haven't stated this is a real shame, an incomplete product review far as I'm concerned, especially at this price ! Don't have 3D player for C of B L = wasted extra paid for."
4,SUPERB CLASSIC MONSTER MIX,"I waffled back and forth on whether to get this. By the time I was ready to go for it, it was TOO LATE. It was no longer available for sale here. But then, wouldn't you know it, dumb luck paid off when I checked back and it was available AGAIN - and for only $120!!!! What's great about this set is the original poster artwork featured on the cover of each dvd case. Plus, the individual sepia-tone processed photographs of each monster featured on the cardboard slipcase is cool. Lots of nice special features (commentaries, et al.) It is a great collection. Unfortunately Universal saw the marketing possiblities years down the road after having green-lit ""Van Helsing"" (which I've yet to see, hearing how ATROCIOUS it is), so the only way you can have these films is individually in their current incarnation, which I suppose will suffice as long as all original 8 in this collection are released. HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!!!"
5,"Sharing the love of the movies, with the love of my child","I remember when our son ,and I would watch ""Spooky""movies, we would turn out the light's make sure, we had plenty of popcorn and soda, and pop-in a movie,and enjoy not only the movie, but, the joy of watching your child enjoy what you as a child and an adult, also enjoyed!!So, take sometime, order a pizza grab a pillow and put in the movies and Enjoy,sometimes the memories will last a lifetime."
5,Almost Perfect,"These transfers are terrific. I love seeing the classics in high definition. It should be noted that most of the supplements are ported over from the previous standard definition releases, and so they don't ""pop"" like the hi-def stuff. They are still enjoyable though. Where I really have a problem is in the so-called ""archives"" for each film. These are essentially slide shows, including poster art, lobby cards, on-set photographs, etc. Universal ported these over in standard definition and they look like garbage. Seriously. These still images should have been re-scanned to take advantage of the new format. They COULD have looked amazing! For something this important, Universal should have stepped up to the plate on the ""archives"" section. I'm giving this 5 stars for the main features. If you're even a casual fan, you should get this set."
1,"how can you ""review"" something not yet released?","I certainly agree that these are classics (and ""Werewolf of London"" should've been included) but it is decitful of Amazon to publish ""reviews"" of a set that hasn't even been released. These are reviews of the standard DVD set not the Blu-ray. What we who already have these want to know is whether the Blu-ray transfers are good and enhance these films or stay with what we have. Again, Amazon shouldn't be publishing ""reviews"" of something that hasn't actually been reviewed. 5 stars for the set (standard or probably Blu-ray) but 1 star for Amazon."
2,Awful packaging,"While the quality of the content is fine, the packaging has a horrible problem. I went to pull out The Mummy and found that the adhesive used to put the sleeve together had not fully dried and the disc was glued into the sleeve. This proved to be the case for all of the rest of the discs except for the first two (Dracula and Frankenstein). With a cloth and some rubbing alcohol I was able to recover all of the discs but, given the price of this product, I found this to be inexcusable. I would steer customers to the British version available on Amazon.uk which costs less money and has a different packaging scheme that should avoid this problem."
1,Much Cheaper on Amazon. UK,"I am excited for this release, but the one star isn't a product review. If you go to amazon.co.uk you can get the same thing (In slightly different packaging)for much cheaper. I myself ordered the Limited Edition Coffin box set and it still came out to be $40 cheaper."
5,Universal Monsters Coffin Box Collection,"I love this box set with all my heart. It is gorgeous! However, The Mummy disc skips every time at the same spot, which is very annoying. Other than that it was a great buy."
5,This is the best that they ever look,"Wow this is the best that they ever look. i bought these movies on every format VHS DVD and now Blu-ray The picture quality is Awesome with Clear sharper Picture With Rich B&W; You can see every Detail of the film. The sound Quality is good too, Sometimes you get to hear things you never heard before.."
2,"Great Classic Monsters The Essential Collection, Poorly Packaged","I really like the Classic Monsters,The Essential Collection. I am a fan of those movies when they were in the theaters on Saturday afternoon. I would have given it 5 star. but won't because of the cheap casing of 100% card board. Every time you remove or insert a Blu-Ray disk into the card board sleeve you take a chance of scratching the Blu-Ray disk. You would think that for the HUGE price you pay for the collection, the packaging would be of better quality. I give the collection itself a 5 stars and the packaging a 2 stars."
3,Audio quality severly lacking,"Although the video transfers are simply superb, I'm afraid the audio is only mediocre. In Dracula the hiss of background noise can be noticible to the point of distraction from the excellent video quality. The Mummy shows simular noise, but not as glaring."
5,THE BEST CLASSIC MONSTER COLLECTION YET!!!!!!!,I think that this collection is probably one of the best I have ever seen. All the movies are in great remastered condition. This would be a good set of classic movies to own. You will be very happy with what you buy. P.S. Planet of the Apes RULE!!!
3,I DON'T SPEAK SWEDISH,"Had I known that I would be sent the Swedish version of this collection, I would have bought the regular collection that does not have the Coffin Box. The book was written is Swedish and I can't read or speak the language."
5,Great Transfers of Movies I Love,"This is a super upgrade of the eight masterpieces of the Universal Monstercanon. My jaw dropped several times watching Dracula look so much better than I have ever seen it.....the scene where Dracula enters the concert hall is so clear it looks like it was made yesterday.......also great is the improvement in audio tracks over previous releases....this set is a keeper and thank you, Universal, for these magnificent discs.My disappointment is the lack of 2 masterpieces not included in this blu-ray package: Dracula's Daughter and Son of Frankenstein where Bela's Igor still impresses me as the best performance by any actor in any Universal monster movie. Oh well, maybe one day we will get these movies in blu-ray format.I recommend this package highly...............watching these has been fun."
4,Images look there best but the packaging has some problems.,"The 3D version of ""The Creature"" is fantastic, but all the disks have sticky glue on their edges from the slip-sleeve packaging."
1,"Too tense, ragged and raw","The problem with this ""Traviata"" is not that it is ""too fast""--Maazel's recording of the mid-60s and Carlos Kleiber's of the late-70s were just as fast or faster--but simply that neither Albanese nor the NBC Symphony has the technique to negotiate these passages flawlessly. Thus, we have a Violetta who huffs and puffs through a PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE tempo for ""Sempre libera"" (Moffo, Olivero, Sutherland and Cotrubas had no such problems in their recordings of the aria, at similar speeds), and an orchestra that sounds rough and steely at every turn, even in the lyrical passages.This, along with the ""Fidelio,"" the 1941 studio recording of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto, the Nutcracker and Carmen Suites, the Schubert 8th and anything by Shostakovich or Sibelius, are the NBC recordings one should avoid. Toscanini made many beautiful recordings--some of them are still unsurpassed after more than a half-century--but this isn't one of them and never will be."
5,New Immigrant Classic,"I had not heard of this novel or author when I saw the book on a list of ""new immigrant classics"" in a special New York Times feature on immigration, which is my area of study. And I must say that I agree that it shares something with the classics I love: that powerful, intangible that hits you and lingers after you finish the last word and makes you want to read it again. While ostensibly focused on the tribulations of a family of Koreans who immigrate to New York, the author has successfully transcended the genre and has provided a compelling and nuanced portrait of family relationships. Beautifully written and very highly recommended."
4,Great to read first hand the first scientific steps,"Putoff and Targ were among the first scientists to put anomalous cognition under the scientific spotlight. Through their work at SRI, remote viewing became a reproducible phenomenon in scientific laboratories. In reading this book I gained a more intimate knowledge of those exciting early days. It comes across on a personal and honest recounting of their experiences and experiments, and the people they worked with (within the limits of military program secrecy obligations they were under at the time).This book is certainly a valuable library addition for anyone seriously interested in the historical roots and facts concerning remote viewing."
3,Great Movie but should have been warned,My son is totally obsessed with sharks. He got this movie for Christmas. The second episode is very graphic and gory. There was no warning and it is rated PG. I fast forwarded through several parts. The other episodes were all very interesting.
5,Love Sharks,"To me Sharks are the king of the deep blue sea & ocean. There are over 300 different kind of sharks. To see them glide through the water and burst with such amazing speed for there size, its just awesome! Anyone who likes to watch sharks & learn about them this DVD is the one and more!! You can't go wrong. I have all the shark weeks. There just Jawsome!!!!!!"
3,a little disappointed,"This release is OK given the price I paid. I was disappointed to find out that it is just collection of four episodes. They should just call it ""Shark Week: Four Random Episode Collection"", instead of something like ""25th anniversary"". My two year old did enjoy it so that is great. Picture quality is great. They also need to do a better job in story telling."
1,Very disappointing,1 Start is for the release the episodes are good and if you don't have any of the other DVD releases it's a nice mix of episodes. The 20th Anniversary DVD set was great it had a ton of episodes and was a box set. Not that they need to do a big box set every anniversary but this is just a bad release 4 episodes and 3 of them are on other Shark Week releases so really if you are a fan and have the others like I do you are buying it just for Great White:Uncaged.
4,"It was a great, well-written book.","I think that Cry, The Beloved Country was a great book because it was exciting. I never knew what was going to happen next. One thing I didnt like about it was it was kind of confusing when they used South African words but it was still a great book. When I started this book I couldnt put it down. The Rev. was a man of great christian values, even when his kids did something not acceptable. He took in Absaloms wife and that was a great thing to do. In conclusion, I think that anyone could read this book."
3,"Cry, The Beloved Country was a very fascinating novel!!!","I liked the book of Cry, The Beloved Country. The begining of the book was a little confusing, but then when I began to understand more of what was going on, I began to like the book. The book demonstrates the racism that existed in South Africa and how different types of people were treated. The book is about a parson from Ndotsheni who went to the city of Johannesburg to find some members of his family, who have moved there. Most of the book explains what happens while the man is in that city, and what happens afterwards when he comes home to his country. This book would seem like an interesting book to someone who likes to read about segregation and family life. This book is an exciting adventure, which includes many interesting suprises and evens. Overall, I learned many facts about South Africa and the life that people have there, while reading Cry, The Beloved Country."
4,This novel was an excellent portrayel of Apartheid in Africa,"This novel paints a vivid picture of the tragic injustices that occurred in South Africa long ago. It portrays the life of a native man as he struggles to reclaim his old life. Umfundisi, reverend Kumalo's blind eyes are exposed to the dreaded reality of famine, fear, and inferiority. Kumalo ventures to Johannesburg to rejuvenate his lost sister and find his son Absalom. Through his triumphs and disappointments he clearly sees the ways of life and becomes consumed by them. His life begins to crumble, but his hope for the country grows. After descrimination, lies, murder, and betrayel, the only rejuvenation that will be done is the renovation of a country in trouble. This book's symbolic message moved me greatly on account of its horrible truth. It displays descrimination of the past and how it thrives through the future. This is a bold book that opens eyes and minds, but will leave your mouth closed."
4,Fundamental treasures worthy to collect them!,"Around the celebration of his 75th anniversary, Toscanini decided to record in Carnegie Hall in three different dates of 1941 this superb Op. of Brahms, visibly the preferred of the conductor. Although its visible tautness, gains in expressiveness and muscular propulsion and assertiveness. It's not his best version, but it's worthy to have it!The Serenade No. 2 reminds us in its first bars, far echoes of his Second Piano Concerto Op. 83; this is one the best musical achievements of this renowned director. Plenty of delirious spring airs, it evokes perhaps more than any other Op. - except the Second Symphony - those far youth `s dreams. With the only exception of a formidable performance of Istvan Kertesz in front of the Vienna Philharmonic, no other conductor has been able to extract with such refulgent intensity and faultless lyricism as Toscanini did it."
4,No Instructions Either,"I ordered this from Canon, in August and finally got it on Dec 1st. No instructions either. After tinkering around I knew even if I got it set up the way I thought it should be, I was afraid it was not correct and might fall apart. It was 229.00 after all. Someone sent me this great link from the Canon learning center, on the 100mm macro lens. Included is a diagram on how to set up the ring mount. Lifesaver. Hope this helps someone else too.[...]"
4,good Pittsburgh punk rock,"Probably made better by the fact that they don't seem caught up in any trendy ""scene"" or genre that will be here today and gone tomorrow. You can tell these guys are in it because they love the music. No posing, no skateboards, no fake British accents pretending to be The Business. Just straight ahead pub-style punk rock. They know how to change it up just enough to keep the melodicism and the hard edge in proper balance. If I had to compare them to a band, maybe I'd say The Workin Stiffs from San Francisco, or a streetpunk band that just sounds that way and isn't trying to be some '77 throwback. They are in the here and the now, and the honesty is refreshing. A quality listen."
4,Very nice!,"Very high quality craftsmanship in these headers. I installed them on a 99 Dodge Ram and I am very pleased with the performance. Noticed small mid range gains and slight increase in gas mileage.Only con was fitment wasn't perfect when installing them. Had to pry exhaust to get collector lined up. Other than that, I love them.Will definitely be finishing off my exhaust system with something from Gibson."
2,Disappointing,"Skrape's debut ""New Killer America"" was a surprisingly solid debut album, but their follow up ""Up the Dose"" just screams the word generic almost the entire way through. While the band still has a heavy vibe with some killer grooves, most of the songs just have a feel to them like ""I've heard this before, and heard it done better"". I saw these guys live on the Extreme Steel tour a few years back, and I felt they had the energy; and judging by they're debut album, the potential to be the next Pantera, but with this lackluster release, I'm wondering when Skrape will show their true colors."
3,Turn Down The Bass,"All I have to say is that this CD gets a little boring after awhile. The band needs to take a different approach in their sound. The bass was the real problem I had in this CD. The bass drowned out all dynamics of the audio and killed anything worth ""JAMMING"" to."
2,Fall from grace,"Skrape really threw it all away on this one. Their debut was strong, with heavy guitars overshadowing vocals (in a good way). Here, the vocals take center stage and the lyrics are quite a step backward.I'm just glad I only spent 8 bucks. This one is headed for the trash. Stick with ""New Killer America""."
3,Change for better or worse?,"I have listened to the cd all the way through, and while it is good, it doesn't really sound like the same band. I find myself struggling to hear the same vocals that defined the band on the first album. I'm all for melodic stuff, but this sounds almost akin to the metal that has taken over the mainstream. The first album was gritty and exciting as others have said, but this one just isn't as catchy. I read a review that they toured with Pantera and the learned alot from them. I don't tink they learned anything. I think someone offered them money to change their style. So, while it is a good cd, it simply doesn't measure up to the first one. It sounds like a different band."
2,"Inadequate, distorted view of Zane Grey and his books","Contains inaccuracies about the books, which he fails to understand. His views appear to be dominated by political correctness. He states Zane was ""conservative to the core'--this about Zane Grey who relishes students rioting against police and has the hero slug an officer trying to arrest a coed for speeding and who never described a sheriff or indeed any law officer he didn't ridicule and despise! As a professional psychotherapist, I am aghast at his inept view of this happily married, good father as neurotic and a failure. Do not read this book. Buy Grey's wonderful Robber's Roost or The Rainbow Trail or The Heritage of the Desert instead."
5,Classical Passion,"I was delighted to find the one particular piece of music I had been looking for on this c/d. Even though I could not hear the pieces (due to unavailability), the c/d arrived in great shape and all the pieces were clear and well played. I did not expect such a quality c/d at such a low price especially since one could not hear the selections."
2,"No matter what else anyone says, here's the truth....","First Truth: Arturo Toscanini was a great conductor of the NBC Symphony Orchestra--back in the forties. It is easy to hear his very mature readings of Beethoven barely pushing through your speakers when you listen to this recording. However...Second Truth: Unfortunately, though the remasterers did all they could, I would not recommend the poor sound quality of this CD to anyone. Unless you are a Toscanini fan (why?), there are way too many other good versions of Beethoven's symphonies, especially the ninth (Bernstein is good, Szell is better...), to buy these scratchy five discs. The setting of Schiller's Ode to Joy in the last movement of the ninth sounds more like ""Shriller's Ode to Noise."" Your CD player hearkens back to a dirty record player in a barrel; this sounds nothing like digital or ""Living Stereo,"" and the sound inadequacies make this set impossible to recommend...."
4,An exciting mystery story for those who like dolls,"""Missing Melinda"" involves twins named Ophelia and Cordelia, who, despite being tomboys to some degree, are still fascinated when they find Melinda, a beautiful old doll. Unfortunately, Melinda is not only beautiful but valuable, and is soon stolen. The girls have a suspect and rig an elaborate plan to trap him. This is a very good children's mystery and despite involving fancy old dolls, is neither prim nor prissy. I read it when I was about 10 and on vacation and thought it very exciting - it also inspired me to become interested in antique dolls."
5,This CD is truley a Blessing!,"When I first heard this cd I could not put it down. The singers are truely anoited. I quickly fell in love with I'm Blessed. WOW, what a powerful song. But then I continued to listen and the vocals got better and better. Roof Tearor and I'm Healed will touch your spirit. You let me know and Affirmation are just exceptional. The chior has a mixture of vocals and they sound like seasoned professionals. Dont sleep on this new group. All of the songs on the cd are different, that is one thing that I like. They don't sound the same, not to mention the tracks are on point. This is a MUST HAVE for your collection. You wont be disappointed,you will simply be BLESSED!"
1,very poor in quality,"The explanations of the answers provided by the book are superficial and almost never insightful. I sometimes couldn't help wondering if not knowing the correct answers, how many right answers the author would be able to pick... What a waste of money!"
1,Turtle gets stuck,I have had this log in my turtle tank for a few years. First we thought it was great but as our turtle has grown he gets stuck inside the log. This log is great for small turtles but not for one bigger then the palm of your hand.
4,Great,Our two red eared sliders love this floating log. It is bottom heavy so rolling it around in the water is hard. The only reason I wouldn't give this a 5 star review is that I feel the bottom could be a little heavier because my turtles are so big that they actually have rolled this log a few times!thanks
3,Sadly 'samey',"I bought this album after hearing one delicious, seductive track on the radio. Unfortunately there is a dreadful sameness to many of the tracks, with only a couple of very twee folky pieces for variety. I suggest you hear it all before you purchase."
3,Disjointed book; many color and B&W photos,"It is hard to discover the organization of this book. It is very British in orientation and style...a bit off-putting to the American reader. All rh drive cars. My biggest annoyance/complaint with the book is that there are probably 30 color photos of one particular blue Turbo SE Cab. Beautiful car, but it doesn't warrant this much of the book. I recommend Peter Morgan's book (Original Porsche 911) as a better alternative. Better organized, better photos."
3,Confusing Continuity,Nice book with plenty of great photos but trying to understand the sequence of developement of the 911 in this book is a real challenge.
1,Delivery canceled days before Christmas,"I ordered this watch for my wife a few weeks before Christmas, with a reassurance that it would arrive in time. Then a week before Christmas I got a notice that the order had been canceled! No explanation or remediation was given.I scrambled for a replacement (from a different company, which will not arrive in time), but people should know that the delivery from this company may be extremely unreliable."
4,Critism (constructive),"I love these guys to death and it makes me happy that they tried to write their own songs, but some of their lyrics are laughable. 'Up down, All around shake your booty to the ground?' I mean come on guys, not everything has to rhyme and if you do make it rhyme it doesn't have to be non-sense, it's not as bad as Rich Cronins but it does bring the cd as a whole down a notch. I also really liked the accopela interlude and was disappointed that there wasn't more!"
3,Not their best work,"""Revelation,"" by 98 Degrees, is a fairly good CD from this vocal group. The songs are a mix of sugary ballads and fast tempo dance songs. The lyrics have an emphasis on love and romance.The group sounds as good as ever, both in terms of lead vocals and group harmonies. But much of the material is weak. Few of the songs are particularly memorable, either in terms of lyrics or musical arrangements. The exceptions are ""Give Me Just One Night (Una Noche)"", a catchy dance number that gives a nod to the ""Latin explosion,"" and the tender ballad ""The Way You Do."" On the negative side, I disliked the gratuitous electronic vocal distortion on part of ""The Way You Want Me To.""98 Degrees has done stronger work on their CD ""98 Degrees and Rising."" Still, if you like the ""boy band"" sound, give ""Revelation"" a try."
5,Absolutely Amazing!!!!!,"Wow, this cd is incredible! The guys are sooooooo talented. Each cd just gets better and better. My faviorite tracks are: My Everything (a really romantic song) and Dizzy (an awesome dance track where Nick raps!) Well, what are ya waiting for? BUY IT!!!!"
4,Good Stuff Baby,"Honestly, 98 Degrees has never been my fave band, but they're definitely proving themselves. I found 98 Degrees and Rising a tad too sappy and love dovey, but not without talent. Revelation is an excellent comeback. Una Noche is a terrific song as a first single and opening song. The best uptempo songs are The Way You Want Me To, Dizzy, and You Should Be Mine. However, there are a couple of their signature ballads on here, especially My Everything. If you're a die hard BSB or NSYNC fan, this probably isn't for you, but if you like good looking guys with lots of muscle and singing talent then 98 Degrees is definitely yours."
3,The Kobayashi Report,"I don't know how I got the CD but it was pretty decent, but it was never really a favorite."
3,(3-1/2 stars) Good but not great,"I never considered 98 Degrees to be a boy band. In fact, every music store I went into always had their albums filed under R&B, and that's really what they seem to be, evidenced by the production and harmonies. While Revelation has some good moments, it's not without its problems.The guys still deliver on the mellow songs. ""My Everything"", ""Stay The Night"", and ""You Don't Know"" are excellent pieces of work. And the fast songs...well, the production on the fast songs should have been more varied, because except for ""Give Me Just One Night"", most of them sound the same. And ""Dizzy"", with its unnecessary rap, could have been left behind.So, this album isn't a washout or anything, but it would have been better to have been able to tell the difference between the uptempo songs. The harmony is still there though, so things are still a little worthwhile."
1,What were they thinking?!,"98 Degrees was always my favorite boy band because they had a special, ballad-y style that made them special. This introduction of new influences didn't make their music better, it DEFINATELY worsened it! Props to ""People"" for rating this CD one of the worst of the year!"
3,Nice Try,"I give 98 degrees a lot of credit. They try really hard to please their fans, and they do a good job of it. But as for picking up new fans, ""Revelation"" wont get the job done. The CD just seems to be lacking something that other boy bands have. 98 Degrees are coming real close to it, and I am sure if they continue on this path that they will find pure perfection, but until then, unless your a big fan, dont expect this cd to be a revelation. How ironic."
5,5 Stars makes this CD the top!,I really thought that 98 degrees new CD Revelation was really good. Some of the songs have really upbeat tempos that you can really dance to and then there are some slow songs that are really great. This CD would be a great addition to your collection.
3,Nice Attempt,"And yet comes another album from yet another boy band. America can't seem to get enough of them, eh? Well, I must say, that this album sounds much better than their first album. Kudos. The songs are all the same, however. Ballads, dance, it's all the same from boy band to boy band. ""Give Me Just One Night (Una Noche)"" was good, the first 10 times I heard it, but now it's just a lil' redundant. ""The Way You Want Me To""...I heard a 2gether version that sounds just like it, and it's not a bad song...all the other songs really aren't that great. If you're debating which 98 degrees album to get, I would get this. If you're just a boy band lover, I'd say get this. If you're kinda into 98 degrees, but not really, don't worry if you don't get this...you're not missin' out on much"
5,"Amazing CD - It really is a ""Revelation""","98 Degrees has truly outdone themselves this time. This CD is truly amazing. It may have the corny lyrics like every other pop CD out there, but ther music speaks for itself. The most amazing track is ""My Everything"", which Nick Lachey wrote for Jessica Simpson, his girlfriend. It speaks so much about love, but it is not a traditionally extremly slow song. It has some drum beats and is a little more uptempo. ""Una Noche"" doesn't give the true flavor of the CD. I think ""Dizzy"" is the est fast song. It is very reminiscint of ""Digital Get Down"" by *NSYNC because it uses computer generated voices, but its fun. I would definietly go out and buy the CD again."
3,HQ web-cam for the money.,"It's cheap, easy to use from the hardware side. However, you have to install some software to get the thing to work with the instant messenger programs. Even then, there is no promise that yahoo messenger or msn messenger will pick the thing up."
5,Could Be The Best Alto Man Around,"I was born, mostly raised, and currently live in Manhattan. That, and the fact that I've had the pleasure of listening to Vincent Herring playing in non-leader roles on a few occaisions at Club Smoke, originally drew me to this recording. I was not dissappointed. The music selections are excellent and Vincent plays sweet and improvises with imagination and verve. Don't hesitate to add this one to your collection."
4,Good times are back,"This was a very welcome return to form for the Destroyer after some lacklustre times and the thing that pleased me most was the fact that Remo was facing somebody as superhuman as him. Although the recent Nazi stories were taking Remo and Chiun back to how we like them (bickering and smartmouthing each other) the villains were hardly much of a challenge so there was a bit of a ""ho hum"" flavour to them. This story was great though in that we had somebody who could damage Remo which gave some much needed tension to the story and which led to a great showdown. A really entertaining read."
4,HOLD ON,"KETCHUM is one of the most underrated authors out there. He does it again with another great novel in STRANGLEHOLD. Very fast paced read, hard to put down. One of the reasons I love Ketchum's work so much is that it is believable, scary thing happen to regular people without the supernatural asspects of most horror authors. (except in his novel SHE WAKES which is my least fav book of his). Stranglehold is a novel of suspense, horror and retribution. Thank you kindle for releasing this hard to find gem. If new to Ketchum I recommend first reading THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, it will change your life and you will be a Ketchum fan too, that is if you can get through it."
3,Not Jack's best work,"While the book will entertain and has all the disturbing markings Ketchem is known for, it's not his best work. The ending is pretty implausible. Still, not a bad way to spend a few evenings."
1,fell apart day 2,My son saved his summer allowance for this beyblade and day two the spring caused the tip to crack and everything fell apart.
3,Beyblade Fans - this toy disappointed my 6 year old,"My son is a Beyblade FREAK. He watches Youtube videos of them daily, has probably over 30 American Beys, and has been dying to own a Japanese Beyblade.I purchased two for him for Christmas and this morning we had our gift exchange. These were going to be the exciting toy! First off the directions were completely in Japanese not English anywhere. So we had to try to follow the directions by picture. Simple... NO! This was VERY challenging and I have put together my share of Beys. Very frustrated with this.I thought there would be something ""special"" or unique about these but if I had to pick - I would totally say skip this and just buy the normal ones sold in Walmart/Toysrus.This was sort of a let down. I am sure he will figure it out but they are very tricky to put together correctly."
2,Not a great bey,My son found this particular beyblade to be made from cheap/inferior parts. The engine gear piece broke as the result of a broken gear and coil. It's spin was consistently off and lost speed too quickly.
4,Son's Christmas gift,"My son had added this to my amazon wish list and I bought it for a stocking stuffer. He has played with it every day since and loves it!Fast shipping, it was brand new, it the box!"
4,One of the first blades in my recollection process,"Everything came like expected, except that the box was slightly damaged... Which isn't a big deal i am just happy that i actually got it!"
3,Relive a classic Doctor Who story,"The Target novelizations are a great way to relive the old Who stories without being bound by TV's special effects budget. ""The Time Warrior"" has a special place in Who fans' hearts as being the first appearance of beloved companion Sarah Jane Smith. No great surprizes in this novelization, but just plain fun."
5,Great toys,"Our boys like these, although they are mostly interested in putting them in wagons and hauling them around as they are pretty young. Give them a few years and we'll have mock battles. My husband says these are ""early"" or ""classic"" legionaries, as opposed to the later Byzantine ones, so apparently they're authentic enough for recognition!"
5,The best,"These pencils are great and you should use them for everything you use a pencil for, as well as mostly everything else. Shipped on time and had a litter of 11, despite my ordering a single pencil, so bonus!"
4,"Two bands that emerged from the 60s, back to back","Interesting pairing of UK (Hollies) and US (Byrds) bands, featuring 5 tracks by each. The Hollies' great calypso charmer, ""Carrie Anne"" starts it all off in fun fashion. Of particular note is an excellent B-side, ""Everything is Sunshine"". Byrds tracks include the cynical ""So you want to be a rock & roll star"", apparently a jab at the manufactured Monkees, who at the time were cutting into The Byrds sales figures. No rare tracks, but a good sampler for casual listeners."
4,A good sampler.,"This set is an interesting combination of the Hollies and the Byrds, it is also a very good sample disc for its price.No, it isn't the GREATEST hits but not bad at all. The perfect way to tell if you want to get into either the Byrds or the Hollies."
4,women's roles in a male world,"I read this book to better my understanding of issues in the Middle East, and more specificly, women in the Middle East. I am an outright feminist and, as an independent project, I am researching the role of women in many different locations of the world. One location is the Middle East, and this book provided me with a lot of background infromation and gave me specific examples that I could site in my papper. A VERY useful tool for all Middle Eastern historians and Women's studies majors."
1,Hate it...Hate it...Hate it!!!,"This is not a program that ran well on my computer. I could get the lessons to download. However the ""reward games"" part of it would not. Everytime you finished a lesson I would get an error code and then I could only go on to the next lesson. This is no reward for a child learning how to type. I called the company and they e-mailed me a link to get the updated version and I got the same thing with that one too. There is a link to download a ""fix"" to this problem. Instead of fixining the problem it messed up my computer!The Sponge Bob typing program is the next one I purchased and I must say it is much more ""user friendly"". The only drawback is that you need the disk everytime you play. But you will get better results in the end.I would advise against getting Typing Instructor for kids...either version. Sponge Bob is slightly more expensive but you know the saying: ""you get what you pay for""."
2,Bored my sons to tears...and me too,"I bought this because of the excellent reviews, but my 8-year-old and 6-year-old sons found it horrible. I thought they were just being whiny, so I ran the program myself. Turns out my sons weren't just complaining! The characters are undynamic to the point of uninteresting. So we also tried SpongeBob Typing a month later and found it much more engaging. SpongeBob Typing also did a better job of controlling the children's progress so they would be ready for the games and drills, and for moving to the next lesson. Typing Instructor moved them before they were ready -- perhaps attempting to compensate for the dull nature of the game with premature advancement.Ugh, look for my copy of Typing Instructor II on ebay!"
1,Typing Instructor for kids,"This product is not compatible with Vista, and trying to contact the company to get the appropriate patch is almost impossible...."
2,Got stuck after the first level.,"My child cannot proceed with the next level/lesson because he says it got stuck on the 1st one. I haven't looked at it yet, but any decent program should automatically advance to succeeding level. Hopefully, I can make it work when I find time to mess with it."
4,Easy to use and a great tool for the kids,This has been a great tool for my son. He really does not like to write and it has been beneficial for him to learn to type.
3,"A good game, not a good instructor","I bought this product because the reviews were so complimentary. However, this product is not meeting our needs. The pace is too quick and my son (8) is permitted to move before he has really mastered the lesson. I am able to set the Words Per Minute higher but once he reaches that he is given another 4 keys at once. Although it seems he has mastered the lesson, only his short term memory has learned anything and any long term muscle memory has no chance to develop. Also, there is no way to go backwards and repeat a lesson to review so I have had to make my own worksheets in MSWord to cover keystrokes he is not competent in. This is a fun game for him after his normal keyboarding lesson but I will no longer use it as his instructor."
1,What a boring book!,"Nonsense. I never read such a book like this one. Maybe the author study very hard, but it is no use. My English is very poor, so I can't accurately express my feeling. But, I must say, this is a boring book."
1,Did not last,When pulling the tape measure out you need to make sure when you get to the end you handle it very gingerly as when it is out to the maximum length it basically got stuck there and never returned back to re-coil mode. Used it a few times but that was it.
3,Vacuum bags,I haven't really used them yet; they are just spares -- but the bags are small and in no time will need to be replaced which then becomes costly.
3,"Not the brand shown, but will likely work OK","The picture for this item shows genuine Hoover brand R-30 bags. The ones that arrived are ""EnviroCare Technologies"" R-30 bags. I'm sure they'll work fine (I haven't tried them yet) but I think it's a little sneaky to show the manufacturer's brand in the picture and ship another brand. I don't see anywhere in the description that says that a different brand will be shipped."
5,"Hard to find locally, fit perfectly","Man, these are hard to find in any local hardware stores. Fortunately they're always in stock on Amazon and they fit my floor vaccum Hoover perfectly."
4,classical short stories,"All the stories in this book are written way back in time, in older style English....i found it very hard to get into as i like to read and turn my brain off a bit....but these stories require you to be 'on'.They are classic stories, but not my cup of tea.....if i want to read old English I will go and get a classic Charles Dickens novel and 'go there'."
3,"Perhaps not ""short short""","The book has some good stories in it. The problem I have is, it's caked ""Short Short Stories,"" but most of the stories are simply ""short"" stories."" if you're looking for flash fiction, this isn't the book. And while it's nice they are arranged in a book (which is well put together), these are stories in the public domain, so if you're looking for anything written in the past 80 years or sop, you won't find it here. Al that said, it's a well done arrangement oof the stories, as long as you know what to expect of the stories themselves."
5,Exquisite prose,"Unlike most multi-author anthologies of short stories, this selection has no guidelines other than Mr. Negri's personal assessment of quality. i think he is a fine judge."
1,Not for couples who have experienced treatment,This book discusses the journey up until treatment but the author has 1 infertility counsel before getting pregnant. For those of us who are in the throws of infertility treatment the book is somewhat frustrating. There is no discussion of what it is like to have secondary infertility AND seek treatment with a child. After 14 months the author is preganant with spontaneous conception. The author misses the crux of secondary infertilty
5,LAN CAT 6 Cable,"I used this cable to watch VOIP TVs through my Wireless Router. So far the streaming is good, no loss and interruption occurred. This cable also matches my wall color- white. No issues with this cable."
2,"Fun for child, not fun for parents...","...because the arm/handle broke shortly after we received it. It was dropped on the handle's corner and snapped easily, and super glue, tape, and all the faith we could muster wouldn't seal that break together again. Our daughter absolutely loves it, though, so we keep adding more tape and glue until she comes crying again that it's broken! : ("
2,Careful with your newly-walking child!,"We bought this for our 1 year old and the first time she pushed it she got four steps when her hand slipped and the stroller rolled right out from under her. She fell on her hands, thankfully, and not her face but it scared her so much she didn't even want to look at it again! We were sold on it because we were told that it had some special design where it wouldn't do that, but it did. We are disappointed. I think if our daughter was bit older it might be better--I would suggest you wait to buy it until she is at least 2."
2,product arrived missing a part,"i'm sure that problems can occur, but it was disappointing when this stroller (assembly required) arrived with a key part missing from the box. the return was handled efficiently, however."
2,Save Your Money,I purchased this over doll strollers from stores like Target or Walmart because the reviews led me to believe it was fairly well made and suitable for a 19 month old. I was wrong. It is flimsily made and so small that my grand daughter will be too tall for it by the time she is 2 and one half. Her 12 inch baby doll looks like a giant in this stroller. I am very disappointed and do not recommend it to anyone.
3,functional and fun,"I bought this stroller for my daughter since she has the corolle doll; the doll fits nicely and she can stroll her doll around the house just like mommy. I would not recommend using this stroller outdoors since it is a little flimsy, and I think it would break eventually. Unless you buy 2 and use 1 inside and 1 outside. But it does serve the purpose for which I purchased it."
3,"Fun toy, but not great quality","We bought this for our 16 mth old. Whilst the actual quality of it is not great, and the moulding was faulty and required us to use pliers to cut bits of plastic off so that we could assemble the stroller (we didn't want the hassle of trying to return it as we are overseas), our daughter LOVES it. I'm assuming it is suitable for little ones as it does not fold up, but that is a fault, as it makes it very hard to take around, and our daughter wants to take it everywhere. We couldn't travel with it unfortunately. She gets hours of enjoyment out of it though, so all in all it was a great purchase."
3,stroller,"I think for this stroller that is way over priced for this,I think you can buy the same item at a toy store or walmart for the value.Would I buy this again NO!!!"
5,Worth 100 lessons!,"I hesitated to spend the money on this DVD but I've had lots of fun with it, and it has certainly paid for itself many times over. As someone who is an ""advanced beginner"" without much natural talent, I had reached a plateau after many guitar lessons. I find this DVD far preferable to taking lessons because of the simple fact that segments of interest can be endlessly studied. The songs are over my head, but with many repetitions I am beginning to get them. Equally importantly, I am learning some of the more subtle points such as how to use vibrato, arpeggio, and dynamic range (varying volume) to make the music sound more nuanced and meaningful. Jorma breaks down the songs into digestible little segments and demonstrates them with an incredibly clean style, all the while throwing in lots of nuggets about technique. A plus for me is being able to learn his beautiful song ""Genesis"" which I have loved for years. Jorma -- if you happen to read this -- MANY THANKS!!"
5,One of the best from Homespun,"I found this dvd and tab to be excellent. Jorma is very clear in his teaching and his playing fits the tab very well. Only my limited talent is holding me back from mastering the material presented. As for the individual who rated it one star, well, the pickers he mentioned are definitely masters, but that's no reason to pan Jorma's dvd. Go figure. I highly recommend this dvd to fingerpickers, especially people just getting into it."
3,mom of a 22 mo old,"well, this is not a firm mattress. I do not think this mattress is good for a new born because is not sturdy at all. But if you want to buy a not expensive matress for a toddler, I think this is perfect. It worked for my daughter. She is transitioning from my bed to hers. Its still hard to make her sleep all night on her bed, but we are getting there."
3,"Okay for a toddler, NOT a newborn!!","We purchased a Colgate foam mattress for my son when he was born and absolutely love it. With the impending birth of our 2nd child, we received the Kolcraft Pediatric 1000 as a free item with the purcahse of our crib. Everything I've read says that an infant should have a firm mattress, and the Colgate one we purchased for our son is definitely firm. The Kolcraft mattress - not so much! We decided to use the Kolcraft mattress for my son who is 15 months and his old Colgate mattress for our new baby once she arrives. The Kolcraft mattress is fine, but I would NOT recommend it for a newborn!!!"
2,interesting approach but not the best,"The cartoon approach is interesting, and may be good for younger readers, but the edition Tao Te Ching by Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English is still the best for sheer poetry and beautiful images to go with it."
5,Great for people who like Chinese,"Taoism is one of the most interesting of the Chinese religion/philosophies. The idea of ""The Tao,"" Yin and Yang, balance, and going with the flow of nature in my opinion is very interesting and something we all need to look at.There are many great translations of Taoist texts and books that interpret them. However, not everyone is big into East Asian philosophy. It is for those people I recommend this version and this entire series of cartoon Chinese philosophy books. They are really cute, make good gifts, and are great in the classroom.I recommend this book for teachers and as a gift. People who are deep into this stuff, will understandably have problems with these books. However, for beginners, kids, and as a gift these books are great."
3,Most decent book ever,I have the simpsons 1-8 on dvd so i figured this would be a great companion piece to read while i watch. I was half right. There is some great content but the pages are mostly filled with quotes from the episodes. I was hoping for more behind the scenes stuff and writters notes like the amazing commentaries on all the dvds but instead i got a bunch of quotes mixed in with a few freeze frame notes (about 4 per episode) This is more of something i would have enjoyed as a kid and brought in to school to look up my favorite episodes with my friends
5,"""Better than Duff""said Homer on Eye on Springfield","I'm a diehard fan of the Simpsons,and this book is better than all the other Simpsons books.It gives you short bios on Homer,Marg,Bart and Lisa.As well as all the other Springfieldyins.It gives a page or two about every episode made up to the end of their 1997 season.It tells you things you might have missed as well as highlites from that episode.Thats lines that are said.It tells you the original air date.I found one episode that aird on my birthday of 1994.It also tells you what each episode is about. If I could give this 100 stars I would do it in a hartbeat. SIMPSON ROCK!"
2,ok,I thought the book was ok it did have many interesting facts but i thought it had very little factual information that people don't already know
4,"FUN, BUT SOMEWHAT HARD TO USE","This is a great book! it has a lot of fun information and hidden jokes from each episode. It is a little hard to find each episode even with the index, though. Overall, it is a treasure to all simpsond fans."
5,i Have 2 Words 4 U. THE BEST !!!,"this Book Is The Best Book In The World An I Think Everyone who loves the simpsons Should Own a copy of this fantastic book. On A Scale Of 1 to 10,I give this book a 1 000 000!!!"
3,The print is too small.,"If the print were bigger, I'd love this book. It's comprehensive, funny, and informative. But unless you have particularly sharp eyes, it is too uncomfortable to read. I couldn't finish it, and wish I hadn't bought it."
5,I TOTALY LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I think this was a great book. This is a perfect book for Simpson lovers. I loved the details and pictures in it. I(being an 11 year old Simpson fan) enjoyed every page in the book. It's my Bible.I have seen every episode known to mankind. I would love to meet the creaters of the Simpsons. That's my dream.
5,For Simpsons fanatics! See is you missed an episode or two!!,"This book tells you all you want to know about episodes, charecters, and jokes. It has ever mmm and dough of homer. And every different position that the simpsons have sat on the couch. Want some info about anyone? Including the Blinky the 3-eyed fish or mabye Sideshow Bob's brother. E-mail me. Singndance@hotmail.com"
2,Not nearly appropriate for the real Simpsons-aficionado!,"I know many readers gave this book 5 stars - but they surely have never read other simpsons-guides before! Groening's guide (and im disappointed, he lent his name for it) contains only a very small percentage of hidden details and movie-references, but mainly relies on large pictures (which unofficial guides cannot offer, as those pics are under copyright of 20th Cent. Fox!) In a few words: This book might be interesting for the novice, but real simpsons-connoisseurs will miss loads of information! (watch out if you can get W. Martyn's & A. Wood's ""I Can't Believe it's an Unofficial Simpsons Guide"")."
1,"Uh, I read it...didn't like it...","When I [found] A Complete Guide..., I could not wait to dig into it to relive some of the funniest episodes from my favorite show as well as catch quick and/or subtle jokes I might have missed. After spending an hour or so flipping through its page by page guide, I was ready to clean my ceiling fan blades. A Complete Guide utterly lacks the satiric tone of the show. It's the equivalent of having someone you work with who isn't terribly funny describe an episode of the Simpsons from the previous evening. Simply reading factual accounts of bits that are sublimely funny left me cold. The ultimate Simpsons book has yet to be written."
4,A Fairly Complete Episode...,"The Simpsons have been a part of prime-time televison for over a decade now. This encyclopedia worthy book is basically the companion novel to the first 8 seasons of the seasonly classic. Within it, you'll find so very much information, the book pretty much lives up to its title as it is essesentially the ""complete guide."" Each episode is summarized, has the couch gags, the blackboard gags, Homerisms, and D'oh so much more. The book overall provides for an excellent read and is worthy of placing on your coffee table. The read is easy and provides a lot of insight into the show we all love so much. Pick up the book, because ""it's the right thing to do,"" as a Simpsons fan, in the words of Wilfred Brimley."
5,Simpsons EVERYTHING,"Wow, this book is great. It has everything you wanted to know about the Simpsons, and if you're a real Simpsons fan, you'll buy it right now. It has episode guides, character guides, and LOADS of funny jokes, pictures, and things you may have missed in the episodes."
5,As Homer might say: mmmm......best Simpsons book ever!,"Has to be the best simpsons book i have ever read! It gives lots of info. on each and individual episode up to season #9. But it doesnt give everything, because the creators are still making more episodes. But i hear they are making another book that comes out this christmas! I advice you to buy this book and the new one in December, if you are a true Simpsons fan!"
1,Rear Window Deflector,THE AIR DEFLECTOR DOES NOT CLEAR THE WINDOW AS STATED.THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE WITH OR WITHOUT IT.I WOULD NOT BUY THIS ITEM.
2,Challenger??NOT!,"Of all the Dodge/Chrysler/Plymouth muscle cars of the late 60's and early 70's, which is the ONLY one that has been put back into production? Right, the early 70's Challenger...the Vanishing Point icon. In fact, today's Challenger is intentionally based on the 70's design...looks very similar except less angular and more rounded here and there. So, you would think this book would devote some real space as well as pictures of these 1970's Challengers, say the R/T and more. Forget about it!The author is devoted to the shaker hood, so the only 2 pics of the Challeger are not a Challenger with the 2 air scoop hood, as is also the hood design of today's Challeger only these butterflies can be opened for a ram-air effect...NO, all we see in this book is a Challenger with the shaker hood. Call me former owner of a 1971 Challenger...and greatly disappointed in this book."
3,1/2 size Small to size on width/length,"I love Clarks shoes and they are the only shoes I can wear due to hip pain. The soles are like shock absorpers. I ordered this pair in the same size as the last and it seemed a bit tight fitting in width and length. I am assuming that with wear it will loosen up. By the end of the first day of wear, this particular shoe gave me pain right where the top leather material ends and is sewn into the sole - on both feet. Funny - there is a bit of elastic there. My other Clarks don't have that feature. Maybe that is the problem? I may need to get a shoe stretcher to reach the desired comfort level, but if there is elastic there, I am not sure how well that would work. I should have gone a 1/2 larger."
4,a little small,I bought a 7 but a little small so I returned them back. but they look cute and comfatable.
4,Looks almost like Leo.,This action figure is the closest matched (looks almost like Leo) as far as the others in this set goes. He seems to be a bit more sturdy as well. I'm guessing because he isn't as dainty as the girls are.
1,Handbook for Prospectors,But then one gets one pays for. A poorly written reprint. Very vague with poor substance. I am disapointed that someonewould offer this to the public
1,Horrible film,This film is a waste of money so spare yourself the torture. That is unless you are a fan of the 80's mall teen singer Tiffany because she's in it. But it it is still hooorrrribbblllleeee.
1,What movie were YOU watching???,"Isn't it wonderful when a filmmaker gets friends and family to pack a film with great reviews???This movie opens with a murder that is stiff and badly acted (even by 1960's horror movie standards). Then it follows a bunch of completely boring characters around a cabin with no action, really bad dialogue and worse acting. (Even the actors seem bored to tears.)Gore fans will be disappointed. The primary horror of this movie is that the viewer is so bored the eyes are rolling back in his/her head before you ever get to any of the fake-looking gore.A complete waste of 90 minutes."
3,Not bad... Not good.,"Okay, it starts off a bit slow, but when the main conflict begins it picks up. I really liked how the cast worked together. I was waiting for some really bad/cheesy acting and useless gore. But everyone was pretty good. I even jumped a couple of times."
4,Darkroom classic,"Dub is from the Darkroom Familia. If your not familiar with him, Dub is a rapper and a producer. In my opinion, I feel that Dub is one of the tightest producers I have heard. In hip hop, 50% of a good album is done by the producer, without a good producer a talented rapper is worthless. He has his own style and thats what I like about him. So he produced this whole album ""my way or the die way"" and I was feelin most of the songs. So I think this is defenately worth picking up. With featured artists such as Lil Wyno, Duke, Sir Dyno, and J-Loc add extra hype to this album."
3,pauline theology from a theological view point,"I purchased this book in order to write an essay about Philippians 2:5-11 along with many other materials. His focus on Pauline theology (I personally don't like the word 'theology', though) mainly consists of Adam/Christ parallel and Israeli history, which prevails throughout the book. His argument is very coherent and clear, though, I'm a bit embarrased with his too much emphases.Still, his exegetical analyses (especially on Philippians 2, Galathians 3, and Romans 8:3) are quite impressive. I know there are a lot of pros and cons about his books, but I have to admit this one is certainly one of the NT theology books in our days. Even if I don't agree on every point he makes, I owed this book a lot in my writing."
2,nomadin,This is a jumpy book with very little character development esp. when there is a book 2 . The story line does not flow well and leaves you wanting. Much better fantasy books than this.
4,Waiting for book three,"A fantastic journey! Awaiting Book 3, Mr. Cormier. - Rita Schiano,author ""Painting The Invisible Man""Painting the Invisible Man"
4,Piyo Piyo,This volume is not one of the greatest romantic moments in Maison Ikkoku. The first episode in this volume was invented purely for laughs. The whole wacky Maison Ikkoku gang get stuck in a well during a holiday festival.The second episode is all about misunderstandings between Kyokyo and Godia. Poor looser that Godia is belives that he lost Kyoko to Coach Mitaka. This was my first Maison Ikkoku episode that I have purchased. I assume that there must be better volumes to purchase. Somehow to me it seems as if the anime falls really short of the original manga. I have nearly all of the manga and I was prepared for the characters and the situations. If you are just getting into the series buy the first volumes first. Do not go randomly picking videos unless you know what you are getting into.
3,For little children,"I purchased this horn in hopes of a good sounding horn for a low price, while my horn was being fixed after a horrible school concerct accident(long story). It turns out, this horn's bell is so close to the instrument that even an average sized person would have problems holding this horn properly. I am a very tall person, and I had to hold it much higher than a horn should be. As for the sound, it is a bright sound, much sharper than a concert horn should be. It sounds like a mellophone, which for those of you who don't know what that is, it is a marching french horn. This should only be baught by a BEGINNING student who is on a budget, and even then, a double horn of better quality should be baught in the juinor high years."
4,Test lead set covers almost all possible needs,"Test lead set is very versatile, with multiple leads and a multitude of ends, making it cover virtually all possible needs. Nice compartments in roll-up soft case keeps the many components together in a sane fashion. Good ideato get with the Fluke meter unless one already has a rich selection oftest leads."
4,"Like the leads, don't really care for the case","The leads seem very well made and the kit provides a great variety. However, I found the case not to be of the same quality as the leads or the case that came with my multimeter ( the Fluke 289 kit)."
5,Perfect Complement to the 87,Nice set of quality test leads for the Fluke 87. The leads are very flexible and the probes are quality product. The case is fine for holding the leads.
5,Cables,Thanks very much AmazonYou are the best.My product arrived to my house in the date that you wrote in the web and in very good condition.Regards
5,Fabulous!,"This disc is good, groin-grabbingly good. It's got the kind of high quality mope rock that all of the flavor-of-the-month dandies of the indie scene wish they muster during their guest appearances on ""the O.C."" and ""MTV College TV News."" It's got bass, it's got cacophony contrasted against big harmonies that manage to be catchy without being dumbed down. As a means of comparison, Overlord sounds kind of like the Magnetic Fields or the Smiths, but definitely distinct. For me, the highlights are ""warm body"" (which I heard on NPR's Open Mic thing) and ""landlubber,"" but I could listen to the whole disc, which is way more than I can say about a lot of cd's I've bought lately. Anyway, get into Overlord before they get snatched by some big label and sell out and start having guest spots from Ben Folds. This disc rocks (and I don't even feel self-conscious saying that)!"
3,90% How To and only 10% samples,"Although the sample notes were very good, they could have incorporated many more samples instead of the How To's and Scenario Set-ups necessitating the Notes."
3,Handy little guide,"I have this book myself, and I just purchased a copy for a friend. Much of the information is common sense, but it is great for inspiration. It was a great help when I was filling out our wedding thank-you cards."
3,Someone should remove the old labels,"Purchasing a used book, I realized I could receive a book in just about any condition. However, I was surprised to pay $9.01 for a book with a $1.99 price tag."
5,Loved it Then! Still Love It Now!,"As a child of the 70's and being ten years old when Starsky & Hutch started on TV I grew up watching it and it is very clear to me that most people who were kids when this show started had more open minds about it and appreciated it a lot more than the professional critics who hated this show and lets face it most of them were kind of old and set in their ways and they seemed to hate everthing that kids liked anyway, a whole big geneation gap thing. Anyway I loved this show as a young girl and I had crushes on both David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser and I still love this show and I recommend the first season DVD!"
5,starsky and hutch are alive and well,"forget the movie..... buy the tv show dvd's.. and enjoy. i have all 3 seasons,"
5,THE BEST COP SHOW OF THE 70'S,If you loved this show. This DVD is a must have. I loved this show as a kid. The first season was the best.
3,A Red car with a White strip.,This was My High school days revisited and A great team of street detectives at work...
1,Where is Miami Vice,Come on? Where is Miami Vice?Who cares about Good Times? The Jeffersons? Sex and the City?The best TV show of all time was Miami Vice. PUT IT ON DVD ALREADY!!!!!
5,"Starsky and Hutch, the magic is forever!","What an incredible journey back to the most magical time in the history of buddy shows! Recapture the very essence of everything that this show stood for, beautiful friendship, caring, love, laughter, honor and trust...The action and adventure is still there, but most of all, the relationship that rocked Hollywood with its beauty and its warmth. It's all here in the first season.Tip your hats to Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul for having the courage and the heart to give the spirit of humanity to these characters!"
5,A must have DVD set.,"Great cop show, amazing car chase and good fight scenes. Loaded with humor and 70's pop culture. I will not repeat the good things people have already pointed out.Don't compare it with the Ben Stiller (who is a fine actor and actually imitated Starsky's walk really well) and Owen Wilson movie Starsky and Hutch - the movie does not do justice to the show. Yes, we all know that the movie is more of a spoof but still the characters can't portray what Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul brought to this hit show. The stories have a lot of substance into them and it not just some show with fast car, shooting people etc. - there are several dialogues/lines/scenes that force us to think of various painful issues that are present in the society - especially in the later seasons.You will not regret buying it. It is a must have for any fan of good cop shows with sensitive characters that are passionate about their work. The show is pure fun."
5,BEST COP SHOW,"I was a teenager when this show was on. It had everything a show needs, humor, drama, good stories, wonderful supporting cast and two very good looking stars. Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul had amazing chemistry together.I have all The seasons. It makes for a great collection."
3,Cop Show,"It wasn't as exciting as I remembered it. I guess it all comes down to our tastes changing as we age. Still, its a pretty good show. I will watch it again."
5,A sick pony...,"Mandy Hope loves animals and she knows a lot about them, too, since her parents are vets. She is sad when, Prince, a pony she knows is sold and even more sad when she finds out his new owner is Susan Collins, the most stuck snob in the whole school! Susan is entering Prince in a contest and Mandy realizes that Prince is ill and not fit to take part in the contest. Can she and James save Prince's life?"
4,I love the Animal Ark series!,I think the Animal Ark is a great series for kids. Mandy is always trying to save animals and I think that's what makes the book so great. I loved Prince the pony because on the cover he looks very cute and he sounded like a very nice pony. Once he got sick I was scared. I am now reading Kittens in the Kitchen and I plan to read Puppies in the Pantry and Goat in the Garden.
3,tasting notes,"Hello, I just want to know if the book of american whiskeys includes tasting notes of several american bourbons and whiskeys, and do you know others books that includes tasting notes. Thanks so lot to give me these informations, Yours sincerely Thierry"
5,It reveals the Conciliator,"I disagree with many of the other reviews; simply put, this wraps the glorious Book of the New Sun up wonderfully with terrific experiences of non-Euclidean, non-Einsteinian time.I glimpsed worlds beyond any human's comprehension.It tells the story of the Conciliator, humanity's trial, and the end of the world- the Coming of the New Sun. For Yesod!"
1,Quid ?,"Never, in my entire life as a reader -- and believe you me, I have read quite a few -- never have I read something as incomprehensible as this. If someone could explain the thing (but please don't for I couldn't be bothered), I would vouch for the star I was forced to give on this review."
4,"Unnecessary, but still Wolfe at the top of his game ...","The Book of the New Sun is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. It is entirely self-contained, and brilliant in many ways. It is my favorite sequence of books, and Wolfe is, far and away, on of the best science fiction writers alive. The Urth of the New Sun provides an interesting perspective on the ""actual"" events that resulted in features of the old Urth from the viewpoint of Severian in the original tetralogy. It is an interesting supplement, but given its purpose, unavoidably lacks much of what made the New Sun books so memorable. The Urth of the New Sun is a must-read for Wolfe aficionados, but is not a necessary or key part of the New Sun narrative."
2,Frankenstein,Book in great condition. Different edition or cover of book received then shown for sale. Disappointed with that. Unsure if correct book. Son needed it for college so went to school bookstore to purchase correct edition.:(
2,Disappointing,"I have to disagree with the previous reviewers. Although I'm a fan of 30s-40s swing, and particularly of female vocalists of the period, I found O'Connell mediocre compared to her contemporaries. Part of it is her style, which is pedestrian at best; and when she tries to imitate Billie Holiday I can only groan. There is no comparison. Worse, a good portion of this disc contains those awful, insipid novelty songs that became so popular in the 40s - ""Boog it,"" ""I Bought a Wooden Whistle,"" ""Six Lessons from Madame la Zonga,"" ""Little Curly Hair in a High Chair,"" ""Bad Humor Man,"" ""Arthur Murray Taught Me Dancing in a Hurry,"" etc. Yuck! CD quality is overall good, but that's about all I can say."
4,Great cooling but noisy,"You can't beat these fans for cooling. The difference in air output between the Tornado and a regular 80mm fan is night and day. I placed 2 of these fans on equipment in an office server room. They provide much better cooling than the old fans. These are the most powerful fans I ever used, but they are also the loudest. The sound is comparable to a vacuum cleaner. I can hear these fans 25 feet down the hall from our server room. I'm considering getting a fan control to turn these down when I have to work in the server room. I definitely would not use these in a home environment without a fan control to throttle them down. According to the specs, the fan pulls 1 amp which is a lot of power for a fan. In conclusion, you can't do much better in terms of cooling, but the noise is likely a deal breaker for many."
3,Good fan if you use headphones.,"Fan is very sturdy, offers good cooling. The downside is it is very loud, would not recommend unless you use headphones."
3,Be careful,"This is a fun toy. If you have a server rack, its amazing, if you want to build a hovercraft, its a must have! But I warn you, WATCH YOUR FINGERS! I had some fun with this fan, until one day I heard this terrible crash, it had eaten a wire inside my PC(due to just zip tying the fan to the cpu rather than mounting it properly), all of the blades disintegrated, I had to clean more than 100 pieces of black plastic out of my case, not to mention being bummed that my fan had just eaten itself.... As a side note, you will need a nice fan controller for this to have practical use inside your PC, the noise is just too much to leave on all the time."
1,Burned up in about 30 seconds,Little noisy for the 30 seconds it ran before burning up (too noisy for a home fan). Made a horrible smell. Cannot really comment on much else as the product did not last long enough to evaluate. The thing plugs in to a normal 4 pin connector that ran other fans before this fan and other fans after this fan. Obviously could not recommend.It is a good thing I was there when it pulled this stunt. The incident makes me think that this fan presents an unacceptable safety hazard. I could see it causing a fire.Oh yeah it stinks really bad when it burns up.
4,Easy and addictive read...,"This is an exceptionally light ready, but much better than most other chick-lit texts, although remaining as predictable as most works within this genre.The characters are well-developed and interesting, and with the exception of Hannah, likable. The writing is generally satisfying, although there are a number of cringe-worthy lines and incidents within the work, and the book needs a good editor to weed out numerous grammatical mistakes.Other than that, this is an enjoyable work which will sate any desire for chick-lit."
3,"What does ""Good Condition"" really mean?","The book arrived in very good time and for the most part was in the condition as promised, slight streaks on the spine really just showed that it indeed was used. However, the brown goop on several pages and a few pages that were torn all the way from the bottom margin to the middle of the page were dismaying. Also the publishing was substandard - the version I received had several typographical errors, especially towards the end. I would buy through Amazon again, but perhaps not from this resell-it vendor. Disappointing!"
3,No surprise here,"After the introduction of the three main characters and a few chapters into the book, if you could not figure out how it would end, you have certainly never read a book before! The book was too predictable. It did hold my interest and I did read it to the end, but I like books where the ending is a little more of a surprise. Cathy Kelly is no maeve Binchy!"
4,Irish Ya-Ya's,"Three Irish women, all in their 30's, meet on a trip to Egypt and form an instant friendship. Hannah is recovering from being dumped after a 10 year relationship with a man who had no intention of anything permanent, Emma has been happily married for 2 years and desperately wants a bby and large, lovely Leonie, who is divorced with teenaged children, still can't give up the search for Mr.Right, Yes, it does sound like a typically chick lit novel but these three women are so real with their imperfections and their loyalty to each other that the reader can't help but become immersed in their stories. It's a big, warm read and, if you're in the mood for one of these girly books, you'll love this one."
2,Recommended Summer Reading ......,"....if you have nothing better to do. The characters were kind of cute and their settings were probably right on-- but the story as it unfolded, had its ups and downs. I found myself eager for this long read to end. It was not a book you simply could not put down. I put it down and walked away for several days and did not miss the story or the characters at all. But-- when you had time to fill, it was just ""ok."" I think I bought it because the book jacket had a comment from ""Rosamund Pilcher"" (one of my favorite authors). So-- there you have it-- if you need to grab a book to fill in some summer hours-- and you've read all the other good reads of the summer-- go for it-- but I would probably have gotten it at the library instead of springing for the full price."
4,"Remarkable, extraordinary talent!","I had the opportunity to hear this remarkable Latina jazz singer perform with Clark Terry at the Monterey Jazz Festival and again in London at Ronnie Scott's Club. What a talent! She's got it all--great range, passion, brilliant choices of material that she makes her own. Brazilian, Portuguese, rare jazz gems, sassy blues. This CD captures it well. I recommend it for anyone interested Jazz. A true joy to listen to!"
4,A great way to look at food,"There are a lot of conflicting philosophy's regarding diet but I think that this book offers a way to think about eating in a way we can all live by. This book makes sense and it works! I've lost 10 pounds and I don't think I've had to make a MAJOR lifestyle change. Forget Fergie and her points, forget Jennie Craig and their pre-packaged meals...You can do it yourself and this book can show you the way."
2,Not enought quality on final pictures,"I decide to shoot my under water picture without this filter, some picture start looking so red that I decide to take it off.Could be is other setting on the camera but I tryed different ways...Just try it by yourselve, good luck."
3,Very interesting remixes,"The album version of ""Famine"" isn't even on here, just two remixes. Both are unique and add a very interesting take on the song. Neither are dance mixes. Both feature the entire song, just in a new presentation. A must for a Sinead fan.""All Apologies"" is the album verson from Universal Mother."
5,Great Book,I used this book for my bike. Its very useful and gives alot of tips and how toos. Would recommend this to common sense people though. If you can hold a tool right forget it. Save your money and go buy yourself a Britney Spears audio cd.
4,Good reference.,"Loaded with nice full-color photographs and clear directions, this book is a great reference for anyone looking at performing some basic maintenance on his or her bike. The large page size definitely calls for a two-column text layout, but that's a minor quibble. Content is king, and the book delivers on its promise.That said, the Park Tools website contains a good deal of the same info, and tends to be updated as trends and components change. The Park Tools book is also a good deal, and most local bike shops carry it (a good opportunity to support your local economy)."
2,Nice book but not great,"After reading the other reviews I was expecting this book to be the only book that I would need when it comes to mountain bike maintenance. However, I ended up being a bit disappointed.The photos are fine and there is a lot of material included but the author is awfully verbose and some of the advice he gives contradicts with other repair manuals. Reading the book is akin to listening to repair advice by some friend who has fixed his own car a couple of times but who isn't really a car mechanic by training.Sadly, I will still have to rely on a bike tool manufacturer's website for maintenance guides."
2,Double the trouble,I purchasced the Dual Spray nozzles for all my Rain Bird sprinklers. The Dual Spray seem to spray every where but where you want as they clog very easily. I am always out in the yard trying to fix the spray pattern and end up giving up and replacing the whole nozzle. The bottom nozzle is directed lower than expected leaving a large puddle closer to the sprinkler. The Dual Nozzle sprinkler heads are also more difficult to adjust and do not spray as far as the single spray heads. Some lower nozzles just spray down rather than out. I recommend staying with the single spray sprinklers.
5,Great series,I saw this series when it came out on public TV. Excellent series on Western art. Glad to know it's finally going to be available on DVD. Too bad not on BluRay.
3,informative but dull,"I purchased this set of DVDs to supplement by AP Art History class. It covers an impressive amount of material. Unfortunately, it is presented in a very dull and monotone style. My students don't enjoy watching it and I haven't used it as much as I hoped I would. The BBC Series: The Private Life of a Masterpiece is much more enjoyable to watch."
4,Michael Wood does a good job.,Excellent material. Very good explanations. Good explanation of historical and cultural environments and personalities involved in producing these works of art.
2,Art of the Western World,"It's listed as ""A sweeping overview of western painting, sculpture, and architecture."" Sweeping is the optimal word. Woods doesen't really go into much detail about the art or the artist. Just a romp through history with a few pictures. If you want more than just an overview (and this is not a very good one), sweep this one aside and pick-up ""Every Picture Tells a Story"" or ""The Power of Art"""
5,"great intro to Spain - educational book, not just guidebook",I bought this book not as a travel guide (although we did use it to find out which major sites not to miss in unknown cities) as a way to introduce Spain to my parents and to my students. It is an extremely visually-attractive book; you get the urge to pick it up and discover something. It also has a detailed but manageable-length history section at the beginning. I recommend it to any Spanish teacher (or student).A colleague of mine who is from Spain and is writing a Spanish Civ. textbook even recommends this book.
4,Very helpful on my trip to Southern Spain,"This was an extremely helpful guide during my vacation in Southern Spain. Lavishly illustrated and well organized, it helped us find some of the more remote vacation spots. I ended up reading it cover to cover, just to learn more about Spanish culture. The series must be popular because we ran into other tourists, from France and Italy, who had the same guidebook in different languages. My only complaint is that the authors seemed to focus too much on architectural showpieces, rather than on historical or literary sites."
1,Really sorry I bought it,"This is the heaviest book I own. I like to travel light, and wouldn't consider packing this book. It is full of detail that you would use while traveling, but not very interesting to read in advance and get a general sense of what to expect. I will have to order another guide - and donate this to the Friends of the Library Sale."
5,Absolutely perfect book i would recomend to everyone,"Has everything in it to make your traveling there easy and interesting. Great pictures and maps (I would add some more of them and improve existing ones, but it's Ok in general)."
2,Ridiculously heavy.,"If you are like me and:1. Are backpacking.2. Don't like extra weight.3. Don't care about pictures.4. Dislike cutsie, snobbish writing style for the +45 crowd.then don't buy this book. However, the low end hotels that the book recomends were very nice, clean, and it had more than a few restaurants as well.The book was written for the **budgetless traveller**, those travelling on busses or renting cars, etc. This wasn't made for those that are actually carrying their stuff themselves for any extended period of time."
2,Diary of a Psychic: Shattering the Myths,"I thought it would be a lot different, just didn't like it . I did like her other books and cards."
5,Don't Miss Out On Reading This Book,I just could not put it down. Sonia has an easy writing style and tells her story effortlessly. An absolute must read.
1,Boring,"most of the incidents in this book were recounted in a much more interesting way in this author's earlier works. It almost feels as if she can't really write, it's just that she had better editors at her other publisher. She spends a lot of time retelling her training with two eccentric teachers and her courtship with her husband, renovation of her house, etc. and not much on psychic experiences. A huge disappointment."
5,The Real Deal,I have read some okay book on the subjects of psychic process but this is THE REAL DEAL. I kid you not. This book was very informative and very enjoyable. Sonia goes out of her way to share many lessons in this book. I have read many books even ones from famous TV show psychics. This book is different because it goes in depth and can provide a lot of guidance and understanding. I was very touched with this book. It was very amusing with lots to learn from. This is one book I definately recommend!!!
5,"Grace, Wit and Wisdom","Sonia Choquette, has been a guest on my WLS-TV program ""Chicagoing"" a number of times over the years but when she came on to talk about her newest work ""Diary of a Psychic"" I was especially delighted.The gift she gives us is one of connection in the most profound of terms. She does this with a style that is graceful, filled with wit and is grounded with a quiet and gentle wisdom. She not only shares from the heart but from the depths of her heart as she defines her humanity and ours. She tells the story of her life in ways that speak my truth too. She offers answers, brings light to darkness and provides compelling reasons to believe that those abilities we all have await only our discovery and exploration. Sonia is the consumate and giving teacher, this her newest book, is proof."
4,Taken on a journey,"""I think this is a wonderful book for a person trying to understand being a ""natural"" psychic. It's about a young girl that had a mother that was dabbling in psychic ability and she wanted to do it too! Since we are all ""psychic"" it shows her journey to embracing and acting and WORKING to develop her God given skills! I suggest this book to all my beginning students!"""
2,Childish,This was on the same level as a bad romance novel. Not very interesting and most egoic. This was truly someone who had the chance to say something but chose to be boring.
2,Unreliable Locking Makes These Poles Dangerous,I have been Nordic walking (really hiking up and down mountains) for nearly 4 years. I have had these poles for about 2 years.I used to love these poles. They are carbon and don't vibrate like aluminum poles. And they are light.However I continually have issues with the locking mechanism not locking. I have sent the poles back once. Leki has a lifetime guarantee. They sent out repaired poles.However... having the locking mechanism fail (will not lock at all) is terrible. Once I had to use the poles at their shortest size since I couldn't lock them. Another time I had to abandon the trip.I have Leki traveler poles I use when traveling by air and have had no problems with them.I have given up on these an have just ordered some SWIX fixed length carbon poles.
5,Trident Cinnamon Gum,"I am a gum lover and Trident has made the best cinnamon gum on the market. It's not too strong that it burns my mouth, like other brands. Unfortunately this gum has been discontinued which I do not understand why."
4,Third of the Star Commando Series,"The charm of this series is the exuberant enthusiasm that the author brings to what is essentially a simple story line. The heroes in this case are a crack commando team who are sent into the deadly underground caverns of Hades to retrieve a weapon called a planetbuster.The commandos led by Islaen Connor, and including her consort Varn, her old companion Jake Karmikel, demolitions expert Bethe Danlo and the irrepessible Bandit, a telepathic birdlike creature, are forced to penetrate deep into Hades, battling nature and bad guys.It's a fun trip."
1,It's a bootleg,"This C.D. was produced without the consent or authority of the owner of the recordings, Joni James herself. All the music is available legitimately from her own catalog. The music sounds great because it was taken from the digital remasterings Joni herself financed at great cost and lovingly remastered."
1,Horrible.,"This is amongst the worst I've seen in any kind of instructional DVDs. When I tell friends or expert instructors about it, they have a problem with fathoming it; either they live in Norway or Chamonix in France."
3,Important Message,"Mouw has a very important message that he clearly lays out, and I believe it is one that we need to hear. Although I agree strongly with his position and call in this book, I did not find his arguments very compelling, and I wonder how convincing this book would be to someone who is not committed to civility in their discourse."
5,A reader,"From the moment I read the first page, I have loved this novel. I have read it several times and each time the characters come to life and I find myself caring about them. Hall has to deal with so many issues--least of all, is Ruth the woman he truly loves or should he be with the evangelist? Arthur-the gay gospel singer who sometimes would just as well have a drink or a man than sing the gospel, but who sang it so well when he chose to. Then there are the complex lives of their friends and parents that seem so real and yet so tragic. Baldwin created a masterpiece!"
3,Handy at Home,"If your looking for an inexpensive set of locking pliers for the price bracket these are good.5 in one set give you options when your approaching a situation. Yet, if I had more heavy use I would invest in ones which had better grips. For handy or home use there good, though."
5,Definately worth the money,"We love this pack and play. The bassinet with changing table have been the best things for our newborn. It is great having everything right in your room. I didn't think that we would use the vibrate function or the sounds, but she loves it! I highly recommend this item!"
3,serves its purpose,it's sturdy enough to hold a baby. my baby was 5lbs when she was born and so we used the changing table a lot as her main crib since she was soo small. it's easy to assemble and store. she is now 16 months old and we still use it.
3,Helpful,We didn't use the bassinet feature...but recently started putting are baby in it to play. She seems to be fine for short periods. We also have a superyard... which is MUCH better....mostly because it's bigger.
4,"Cute PACK 'n PLAY, however,,,","I bought this for my daughter, and it is very cute. She loved all the features (the changing table,the light and my granddaughter loves the music). However that being said ,,,this brand of Pack 'n Play was EXTREMELY difficult to assemble, making it impossible to transport and negates the purpose it was designed."
4,Very pretty; Vibration and sounds not so much...,"I am really into the chocolate color for babies now and I love this print. My 4-month old sleeps in it. I don't use the changing table very much now that she's older but it's extremely easy to remove if I need to. I actually leave it on because it creates a cozier feeling for her when she's sleeping in the bassinet. The vibration, sound and light unit that attaches to it was pretty much useless. Fortunately, that wasn't the primary reason that I bought it."
2,"Too wordy, too scientific","too many details....which I personally dont like, too wordy, too scientific. My preference just may be different. I just dont like a very nerdy explanation to every single incident. Wish there was much more humor as parenting is always."
3,Good info,"Good book for generalized information. Claims you can toilet train in just one day however it doesn't tell you HOW! Most stuff in here is common sense and just gives me a sense of validation for my instincts. i have a 26 month old and a 10 month old. the 26 month old will not eat any meats, vegetables or starches and this book does give ideas to help but basically says not to worry or freak out and eventually his eating habits will change, on his own time! when i purchased this book in June of 2012 it said there was a new edition coming out but didn't say when."
4,"Nice, handy quick reference","What I love: Easy to look up the topics in the index, Small enough to sit on coffee table, Topics are short and to the point.What I don't love: There's nothing in here about ""what to do if your toddler WILL NOT take a nap for you but does take a nap at day care."" I wish it covered even more topics.All in all, it's a great reference and I recommend it."
3,Lots of medical advice with little else,"I bought this book as another resource for ideas on the trickier areas of raising a toddler -- temper tantrums, taking away the pacifier, potty training and the like. I expected some medical-related chapters in addition to practical advice on other issues. After receiving the book, I eagerly sat down and started reading. To my disappointment, the book is mostly medical advice. While it's been great when I've wanted to figure out which teeth should be coming in next or narrow down what could be causing a rash, it has very little information about other topics. If you're looking for a medical reference book, this one is better than most. If you're looking for new or creative ideas on how to deal with the behavioral and social issues of raising a toddler, keep looking."
4,Pretty Good,"I really loved Baby 411, so when my son turned 1 I bought Toddler 411 as a followup. I don't know if I was just feeling more confident because I was an experienced mother at that point, but I just didn't use the book a fraction as much as I used Baby 411. But I think it's still good to have on the shelf and even if I've only used it a few times, I was glad I had it when I needed it. I would suggest maybe buying it used, at a reduced price."
3,Not as good as Baby 411,"I loved Baby 411 and Baby Bargains by the same authors, but was disappointed by this book. It is too medically-based and doesn't have enough information on developement and management. While it's certainly helpful to have that medical stuff (esp. in the middle of the night when you're trying to decide whether to call the pediatrician or not), this is not sufficient for raising a toddler. The other big flaw in this book is that I think it tries to cover too many ages in the same area. It covers ages 1-4, and doesn't differentiate between what's appropriate for a one-year old and a 4 year old."
4,This book is great!,"This book is great for any parent of a toddler from the moment they turn 1! However, it more medical in nature than psychological. I was actually looking for something to help with the terrible 2's, and this book is very light in that area. But there a plethera of information in this book, which includes potty training tips, getting rid of the pacifier, nighttime waking problems/concerns/tips, transitioning from a crib to a bed, as well an exorbinant amount of information on childhood illnesses/remedies/prevention from the common cold and broken bones to Staph infection and life threatening viruses/bacterias. This is definately a must have for any parent, and a great companion to What to Expect the Toddler Years!"
5,Toddler 411: Clear Answers and Smart Advice for our Toddler,"I loved Baby 411 and was excited to see Toddler 411. It's easy to use and reference. Has great practical advice with a sense of humor. I lived by Baby 411 and recommended it all new mothers I knew. The same is true with Toddler 411. It's a great quick reference for child development, medical issues, behavioral stuff!"
5,Total must for all parents!,"I read ""Baby 411"" like a textbook when I was pregnant with my son. I highlighted the passages that were particularly revelatory for me, and have used it like a baby bible for the last year of my son's life. We constantly pulled ""Baby 411"" out to consult it about baby-related questions we've had. I even made my husband, who doesn't particularly enjoy reading, read it, to be certain that we both had a working knowledge of babies before our son arrived. Now that he's turned one and become a toddler, I knew I needed to read about toddlerhood, and ""Toddler 411"" was my first choice.I again highlighted the heck out of it, and am continually referring to it. So far, it has been extremely helpful and educational, especially for someone like me - a first time mom who's kind of afraid of toddlerhood and the tantrums it may very well bring. This book is a must-have for parents - it is super thorough and easy to read. Five stars all the way!"
5,Love this book!,"I find myself turning to this book time after time, month after month! I'm definitely getting my money's worth from this book! The format is easy to read and easy to look up information in a hurry. It tends to be more factual with little or no personal opinions coloring the advice. It might be impossible to find a parenting book that a parent will agree with 100% of everything in it but this one comes close I think because it seems to try to stay objective.Honestly, I would recommend this book for any parent of a toddler! I will be giving this to family members and friends as a gift when their babies turn one year old (giving it to the parents, they deserve a gift too!)in the future."
3,Get Fishbone 101 instead...,"This 10 song cd can hardly be compared to the hefty 2-cd 35-song set Fishbone 101: Nuttasaurusmeg Fossil Fuelin. Unlike Fishbone 101, this cd gives you the hits without the alternate takes and B-sides, so it may be slightly more efficient if one has a desire to have only the familiar Fishbone songs without the price of a 2 cd set."
5,Fun,This is a chapter book. My daughter read it over a period of nights to her children. She said it was enjoyable to all and humorous.
1,don't waste your time,"I saw these guys live once and they got that same sound all the mainstream garbage has nowadays. They have really weak lyrics and cheesey riffs. Buy this cd if you like pretending you're a punk, in the meantime steer clear of this laughable nonsense. unoriginal did I mention?"
4,Nice little camera bag,Its the perfect size for my little point and shoot camera. The color is a little greener than I expected but it still looks great. Ive even gotten a few compliments about!
5,A Brilliant Debut,"This is one of those albums that takes a few listens before you really start to appreciate its rich textures and complexity, at least for me. Katonah has some really beautiful moments on it that caught me by surprise. Perhaps the two best songs are ""I was on the Moon"" and ""The Egg"", but the whole album is quite an interesting listening experience. You can hear influences of other bands, such as the Grateful Dead and the Beatles, but in the end these guys create a very unique and full sound. Although it is now three years old, this one still has me riveted."
5,Apollo Sunshine,"Apollo Sunshine's new self titled album rocks! It's fun, easy to listen to to, and thought provoking (hear: ""A Finger Pointing At The Moon""). The first track ""Flip!"" is cool because it has a lot of expected highs and lows. You'll definitely be playing this one on repeat. ""This Is The Day"" is another song worth checking out. It's an upbeat song that sounds like reminds me of just a cool, laid back feel...like Summer. Overall, the album reflects a cool, creative band that has something new and fresh for all Rock fans."
5,Best I've Heard all Year!,"These guys first caught my attention when they came through Detroit opening for Hot Hot Heat 2 years ago. Also on the bill was the Starlight Mints, another pop-rockatoonish band worth a listen.Anyway, I was blown away. Smart, a little nutters, and obvious musical geniouses, They didn't even have a CD then, but they were already stuck in my mind.I finally caught Katonah when they swung through Ann Arbor last year, a few weeks before their appearance on Carson Daly's show. It outdid my expectations. Garage rock has had its day. It's Bathroom Rock's time now."
5,Protect Yourself from Parasites Looking for Deep Pockets,"There are simple steps you can take to protect yourself from many dangers -- frivolous lawsuits, predatory taxes, thieves, and greedy bureaucrats, just to name a few. A good place to start is with Adam Starchild's book.This book will give you everything you need to completely safeguard your home, your family, your money, and your privacy. In other words, everything that's important to you.You'll also find out how to create ""invisible wealth"" and how to use trusts for wealth protection... how to use family limited partnerships... how to structure a corporation for the greatest safety... how to go offshore with your wealth... and how to use foreign bank accounts."
2,I agree with Tennessee,"I have to agree with the reviewer from Tennessee. When you think of a vocalist of the calibre of Ella you don't think any recording could be marginal, but this one really is. Ray Brown & Oscar Peterson's playing are top notch as you expect, but Ella's voice is shaky, often off-key and I hate to say it but she just sounds old. Additionally, even though these are great old standards, the album never achieves any kind of ""swing"". Choose another Ella album."
2,Even Ella had a bad day,"If, like me, you couldn't imagine a bad Ella Fitzgerald record, especially with Oscar Peterson, beware. This is it. It was recorded late in her career, and apparently on a day when her health and voice were rocky. There are literally dozens of great CDs by Ella. This one will make you feel bad for her. It should never have been released."
4,A Very Good CD,"This cd is not as good as her pairings with Joe Pass, but still this is a very good cd, Oscar's playing is great, Ella is in very good voice, yeah a little wobble here and there, but i hear some emotional vulnerability in her singing, and she does some things with certain notes that you don't hear on any other of her Pablo recordings."
4,Music for your ears,Classic Jazz Ella & Oscar just as I expectedTwoo of the most revered artists ever
1,"DON'T BUY THESE GOGGLES, THEY ARE KIDS SIZE ONLY",Do not buy these goggles if you are an adult. The add does not mention that they are kids size!!! The company knows about the problem for months and still hasn't changed the web site describing the goggles. THEY ALSO MADE ME PAY THE SHIPPING TO SEND THEM BACK!! I will NEVER purchase anything from [...] ever again!!!
