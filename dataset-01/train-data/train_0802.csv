2,Christmas Soap,"Sometimes funny and heartwarming, the Whitfield's Christmas homecoming often comes off as a fragmented, episodic, soap opera. The heart's in the right place, but the execution could have resonated more than a substandard holiday greeting. However, when there's singing and dancing, the whole venue shines like a holiday star. (The soundtrack is a must though.)"
5,Antitrust Law in Perspective...accurate title!,"After two years in law school, it is refreshing to use such a well-organized, comprehensive casebook. I have the additional pleasure of learning the subject from one of the authors. Professor Gavil conveys the same passion and clarity for the subject in the classroom as he does in this book. Definitely a great investment, and I would even suggest as a study aid to those law students unfortunate enough to be using another casebook! Good luck in law school."
4,oh yes; definitley yes,"Most people listen to music inadvertently, it merely fills the dreary silences in our mundane lives. This album, though will have you foot-tapping, shuffling round your lounge and having the odd giggle too. An outstanding collection of tunes, the album is what gives eclectics a good name. Check out Spanky Wilson's Northern soul rip-snorter and as for the Reggae version of 'Shaft', well... Don't buy this album if you don't like outstaanding tunes. Buy it if you want to add at least a half dozen tracks to your Top 20 different tunes of all time (mate) then get this pupster in your collection pronto. If you dig it, check out Fat City in Manchester and they'll point you in the direction of some other belters."
1,"1978 Documentary, 35 minutes long, poor film quality","This DVD was a big disappointment. It is very much outdated in narrative style, extremely unsophisticated for a Western public that now has had a high level of exposure to Buddhism. The focus is Buddhism in Ceylon. The visual quality is very poor, the sound quality moderately poor. I am sorry that Amazon is selling it."
1,"For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall s",Ralph you lost it!!! The very sign of our savior you now deny! The whore church and her daughter use this Sunday sunrise to change the commandment of GOD! Only the elect will understand and KEEP the laws of God. First becaue we love him and then we love you (neighbor). Wake up and smell the coffee again. Satan is the real emeny. John6:44
4,Upgraders Beware,"I upgraded Acrobat 5 to 6 Standard and found out too late that the function to create PDF forms is no longer included. Of course, I had to remove version 5 first, so now I have no way to edit my existing PDF forms files other than to remove 6 and re-install 5 or upgrade further to Acrobat 6 Professional. Adobe does not make it very clear at all on their website what features of 5 require Professional or are lost with Standard. Other than this big disappointment, I find the user interface modernized and cleaner and more WindowsXP familiar. The bloated Standard takes longer to open/load than 5 - wonder how much longer 6P will take! Another annoyance are the Office toolbars for PDF functions which don't behave themselves by staying put or staying closed and insist on opening as a separate toolbar row."
2,Batch Processing IS NOT Included in Standard,Do not purchase this product if you are assuming (especially due to the descriptions on Amazon of this product) that the Batch Processing feature is included. It isn't included; save the $7.00 and just order professional. (or better yet use an open-source product)
3,"Beware, this is the expurgated version.","Sometimes you watch a movie because of a good story line, and ""Love Letters"" has a good story line. Other times you want to see a woman with an extraordinary body naked, like Jaime Lee Curtis, for example. If you are a member of the last department, seek out the (very rare) full-length version on VHS that was the theatrical cut. This one is chopped up. Just when things get interesting in the bedroom major portions of the scenes disappear"
4,Highly Recommend this show for your viewing pleasure,"While its not my favorite of all the video official releases, its sure up there. The boys are having a lot of fun (Jerry is practically doing arobics), and it shows. Songs are not supercharged but very deliberate and inspired. CR&S; is very methodically great. Deal is a smoker. Set II has some significant highlights. Ship of Fools is played as close to perfection as the guys could get. And Morning Dew to boot.All in all, a very good show and a lot of fun. Summer time come and gone!Wanna know the kicker? All of the 1989 and 1990 Summer Tours are on this high quality video."
5,Truckin' up to Buffalo,"Love it! Excellent sounding and looking DVD from start to finish. Jerry Garcia looks a little rough, but the man could play the guitar like no-one else could. If you are a fan, you need this DVD."
5,minnie rules man,"love her voice love these laid back jazz fusion tracks put down by the crusaders boy therse songs were sampled by a lot of rappers mainly a tribe called quest, chico and coolwadda, 9th wonder, daz dillinger and more minnie was the perfect angel, another banger is every time he comes around for you guitar freaks who like easy listening fusion this is for you also featrures a young deneice williams singing backup. rest in peace minnie you was ione of a kind."
2,Ummm...,"Well, I actually bought this CD for the song title ""Inside My Love."" I did attempt to listen to all the songs; with the exception of the fav- ""Lovin' You""- I don't listen to to the other songs."
5,I Still Miss Her...,"Minnie was simply the best, with an octave range that would embarrass any of todays contemporaries. Listening to ""Inside My Love"", still raises hairs on my neck, and brings reflection. She struck a tone within everyone who heard that beautiful voice. I remember clearly where I was upon hearing of her untimely passing. All I could think of was, ""God had given, and taken away one of his Angels."" Anyone who heard her voice, can never forget her, and this compilation of songs reflect her true essence."
3,Okay I guess,"It's not horrible or great, it just is. One reviewer wrote ""'Secret Agent Man' (James Bond theme)"" is actually the thems song from ""Secret Agent AKA Danger Man"" TV series, easy mistake to make I admit. You might be thinking about ""Live and Let Die"" by Paul McCartney and Wings which was a James Bond theme , just wanted to clarify."
3,Buyer Beware of this Beautiful Book,"This book, while beautiful to look at, has many errors. The publisher's web site contains an errata and should be looked at before any of the projects are begun.On another note, I did make the My Constant Companion bag and enjoyed it tremendously. The bag gets a lot of compliments."
2,Yarns galore,"Personally felt that the title is misleading. The first two words says Knitters Stash so I thought that the patterns would make use of odds and ends of yarns or allow for easy substitution. But flipping through the patterns, it uses yarns which hides the stitches which may be good for beginner with uneven tension or use specialise yarns not readily available. So not very sure I can find a good substitute for the yarns stated. Otherwise, it has alot of patterns that may interest people but nothing too exciting. It is comparable to pattern leaflets that may be available outside in the shops. Look through the book in your library before buying it."
3,Sorry this book was so disappointing,"I was excited to get this book because I figured ""how can I go wrong?"" with so many different patterns from varied sources. But the patterns are mostly boring and bland except for the patterns from Sophie's Yarns and Maura McBride. If you are looking for something wow, check out ""Poetry in Stitches"" by Solveig Hisdal. That's something!"
2,Doesn't pay off,"I really love the idea of this book -- yarn store owners are great resources for good, real-life designs and use of interesting yarns to make them. And I loved Melanie Falick's book, Knitting in America. But I hate this book for its design. It's an awkward shape (why haven't more people caught on to the brilliance of the purse-sized VK Knitting on the Go series of books?), and the faded pictures of the yarn stores and owners...they look like the printer printed the blue line proofs by mistake. I mean, knitting is nothing if not about color and texture, up close. The patterns were disappointing to me too. Very few I would actually make. Maybe the store owners didn't want to give up the rights to the really good, classic patterns, the ones that really sell? I hope someone else takes a crack at this great idea."
1,One dissenting vote.,"I'll be the one who doesn't think this is anything more than another knitting book. Disappointingly, it is filled with typical ho-hum projects; odd sweaters, ugly shawls, uninspired baby ensembles, and for some reason, many of the projects are felted, not knitted, which was not made plain in the reviews. Add to that the fact that only a few of the projects are written with changes for plus sizes and I am stuck with a book of color photos and anecdotes about projects I will likely never make or wear. I wish a project list had been available, and the drawbacks were pointed out as well as the glories of this book. There are lots of instructions for specialized techniques (like the I-cord bind off) but these are available in books that in my humble opinion contain better instructions and projects at a much better price."
5,Knitter's Stash,This book is almost as good as going to your favorite yarn shop.The patterns are tried and true and easy to work. This is a great book for new and experience knitters.
4,interseting books - not the best patterns,"this book is really interesting - great pictures, but I wasn't too impressed with the patterns - nothing I was too thrilled with."
3,Great for the wannabe yarn store owner,This book is inspiring for people who may want to open a yarn shop. The designs are not for beginners. I just wanted to read the book and the tips. Not do the patterns. The book is too large and the title is not representative of the content. I would recommend the book for knitters looking for challenging projects and using expensive yarns.
2,Only for those with $$$$$,"This is yet another ""catalogue"" written primarily to sell expensive yarn. It has NOTHING to do with using up yarn you may already have from other projects. There is no information on yarn substitution, and there is a lot of blank margin on the pages, which makes the book larger than it needs to be (and necessitates extra page-turning). A good knitting book needs to be useful beyond the lifespan of the current yarns available, and this one doesn't really pass that test.As another reviewer stated, there are more projects than clothing patterns, which is not necessarily bad, but look before you buy. Even with the Amazon discount, this book is 'way overpriced for what you get. I'll wait until this one is remaindered."
2,Not on the Knitting Edge,"I was disappointed with the book. I found some of the patterns to be old fashioned...and not quite retro yet. I am planning to knit the rug, but have not chosen a project from the book yet.This is a book you should check out of yoru library before you commit. A long list of knitting stores is at the front of the book."
2,Where's Virginia?,"The first error I noticed was that Virginia is missing from the comprehensive list of yarn stores.Next, the rug Mom wanted to knit does not give adequate directions; just a color chart, not a stitch chart.It's a beautiful coffee table book but I don't plan to knit from it."
2,Please don't buy it,"There are only few patterns available for such big book, and they range from odd-looking vest to no-use-felted-fish. Unless you can preview the book and find some of the pattern attractive, I think you shouldn't take the risk buying it.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it might be an OK book, if you don't care about the undesirable patterns but you wanna learn about different yarn shops in the US."
4,An Inspiration,"I have also read this book, and met the author. She is a very sweet, wonderful woman. I personally feel that it took a lot of courage and strength to write this book. I believe every word. Some people choose to live in denial about the events that occurred in this book. It is not pleasant to think about the fact that these things do happen, but that unfortunately is the reality. I really admire the author. You are an amazing and strong woman; an inspiration to all! Keep it up!"
1,This lady (Judy ) is nuts,This book is a LIEI bought the book cause my father is in it and told outright lies about him She Will be sued and is known in the Yukon as jumpin junction judy says alot about her she really should bein an instatution
4,Know your Javascript,"This book takes a unique approach to learning. It focuses on redundancy - metacognition and such. I would recommend getting your Javascript and PHP down cold before moving into Ajax. That was my drawback. I give the book four stars because I realize the information is presented well, although some may find its approach a little too ""dumbed down"". I just wasn't ready for it when I read it. You may consider checking out Sitepoints Javascript Anthology if you are an inexperienced client side scripter. Also, check out Larry Ulman's PHP books... It will help!!!"
2,Makes my eyes hurt,"I was wanting to learn something about AJAX, and this book caught my eye online. I wish I had browsed it in a store, because I could have gotten a book that would have been more useful to me. I'm sure it is an excellent book, but I think it is targeted for people younger than myself (I'm 47). All of the ""hand written"" notes with arrows, the ""thrown on the page"" layout, too many different fonts, it all just makes my eyes hurt, and makes it very difficult for me to follow. Will either sell it, or it will collect dust on the shelf."
2,Not so great ...good for beginners,"I purchased this book because it was the ""required"" book for the course I am taking for Masters. But being a programmer myself for many years, this book is a waste of time. The chapters are lengthy and drags the content too much. May be a good book for beinners, but not for anyone else. The book lacks in-depth discussion and not to the point."
2,Not a great book,"I checked this out from my public library last night, and now am thinking about writing a letter to ask why it wastes money on stuff like this.This book takes 30 pages to explain what other books would in a page or two. If you like lots of white space around your text and diagrams, this is the book for you. The entire book could be presented in a couple of chapters.But that's not the biggest problem. The book is solid on fundamentals but teaches nothing about Ajax design strategies or code refactoring. Many frameworks have evolved for developing Ajax applications. These can save programmers a huge amount of time and pain, but the book only mentions some of these in passing at the end. A better book, one like Ajax in Action, would make refactoring a big part of every chapter."
1,waste of money,"This book doesn't teach you anything. Instead of telling you how to do it, the author is wasting your time explaining what you can do with AJAX.If you want to impress your nondeveloper friends, this book might be an asset."
4,Helps You Understand AJAX,"This book is for people who know JavaScript and they are a step above the ""pop-up windows, rollover images, and steal scripts from the Internet"" crowd. It assumes at least a novice amount of knowledge.I'm the kind of person who needs to understand a concept before I get details, else I get lost. I was an ActionScript expert, and mediocre at JavaScript... but didn't know what a DOM was. I read the book very quickly and I was up and running at work, where I was expected to be doing some very advanced stuff. This book helped me get going, but I couldn't have succeeded without ""Ajax in Action"".One of the founders of the Head First series is Kathy Sierra who writes the ""Creating Passionate Users"" blog. I'm not a big fan of blogs, but I read her's everyday."
2,Indirect learning - doesnt work for me,"The book spends about 20 pages introducing you to their genius learning methodologies that keep you interested and involved. That would be great if I was reading this book to kill time and had to be kept interested with pictures and games. In reality, I want to learn the material as quickly and directly as possible. If you are like this, skimming the book is about all you can do. I skimmed it in about 20 minutes (I have previous Ajax knowledge) and it was an OK Intro refresher. If you are serious about learning this and have an attention span greater than a 6 year old, you do NOT want to get this book. It's like playing Where's Waldo for relevant information among the spam of dialog boxes and arrows zig-zagging across the screen.With that said, if you are learning Ajax grudgingly and don't care how much time you spend, this book will be great."
3,Nice book for AJAX beginners,"This book does one good thing, and that is introducing the reader to AJAX.Compared to other Head First books it is a little more repetitive, takes longer to get the reader's head around the topic at hand and finally it has external requirements for the reader to be successful in going through the book in follow by example mode.The external requirements of the book are:1) You need to be able to understand PHP on a very basic level in order to follow through the examples in the book.2) In order to follow step by step the book, you need to set-up your test box as a WEB/PHP server.Requirement #1 is not problematic, #2 may be problematic to some folks, to others it may be even fun -- BTW: The page at [...]I would have given this book four stars for beginners if the instructions for #2 would exist, at least in the head first site, but they are not there yet by 4/10/07.Additional notes:- Chapter 3 example runs dog slow in FireFox and does not render properlyin IE7."
1,Not my style,"For me, all the information in this 400 page book could have been effectively presented in about 50 pages, using a normal page layout with illustrations. While reading this book, I felt like I was wasting my time. Eventually, I found myself skimming the pages for nuggets of useful information buried in all the fluff (handwritten notes, arrows, and pictures of dogs and guys in ribbed sweaters.) I am willing to consider that perhaps the style of this book is just not right for me. But even for someone who likes/is compatible with this style, I believe the limited amount of actual information contained in this book makes it not a good value."
3,Beginners Bible,"HI this is good for Beginners. not for experts.Lot of things repeated 3,4 times. Which is not there in other headfirst books?Good for who wants to know Some Javascript/HTML basics + Good AJAX"
1,So redundant and so boring,"I bought 4 other head first series books, java, EJB, Design pattern, and Servlet. These books were fast, funny and of course, informative. I really love these series. However, when I read this book I was so disappointed. Most explanations are redundant and it made me boring and the reading pace was suspended. I think the author have to add more examples and shorten the explanation. I regret to buy this book. Not recommended."
3,A bit too basic,"I like the concept of this line of books and for me they definately help me get off the ground with new programming techniques.Unfortunately, this book is just a bit too basic, and after I was done with it, I still felt like I had only a very minor understanding of the subject matter.Cons:-- The first two application examples are nearly identical, so if you understood the first chapter, you get very little out of going through the second one.-- One chapter isn't even devoted to Ajax. It teaches you how to create a DOM only application. While it is a nice introduction to the DOM, I bought this book to learn Ajax and I would have much preferred another Ajax application example.Pros:-- At least I now am off the ground and should be able to understand more complex books."
4,"Straightforward Introduction to ""Ajax""","This book is great a way to get an in-depth look at Ajax internals in a short amount of time. The style of the book, including pictures and diagrams, makes the technical material less dry than it normally would be in a text."
4,There are worse out there.,"I dunno about everybody else, but I honestly didn't think this book was all that bad. Though a bit convaluted and extremely hazy, it was a story worthy of every other Star Trek novel I've ever read. And I was pretty happy Barbara took time to develope and expand on Christine Chapel's character. Chris has always been one of my favorite characters on the original series and I liked that Barbara gave her character significance rather than commiseration.All in all, it was not that bad. There are worse Star Trek novels out there."
3,WORTH READING,"I am currently going back and reading some of the ST:TOS novels that I either never read or read so long ago that I have forgotten them. THis one is a time travel/conspiracy story which I'm a sucker for. I feel the book could have used some editing but it has many nice moments including some particularly good writing of Nurse Chapel. Also, throughout the book we are told someone on the Enterprise will do something in the future and when we find out who it is I was surprised-- I had guessed wrong. Last word: entertaining, worth reading."
2,"Dee lundgren, licensed professional counselor, Bucks County, PA",Not worth buying but possibly ok to flip through. I read the book and didn't find much helpful. The illustration weren't that memorable. I liked that the author included scripture since the book was about Jesus as a life coach. This was an easy read book that I felt was alittle dull.
4,Good Battery,Seems to last as long as any other camera battery. Bought this one because it qualified for free shipping.
4,Great book to start MLM.,"It was very simple yet inspiring, and easy to read. But somehow it was too simple for me."
5,this is staight out of the european dance raves,this cd starts with one of its greatest song god is a dj. this song truly has the ability to move you.
2,Not really worth it.,"Conceptually this is a good method of transforming hard water into ""soft"" water via an ion exchange resin located inside the column. Unfortunately, hard water (which exists where water is pulled from the ground, typically) reduces the usability to about 10 gallons of water. Further, the columns are difficult to swap out without producing periodic leaks, they are awkward to store when not in use and they cannot be regenerated at home necessitating the purchase of new columns very frequently.It does not provide value for the cost."
5,Great Water!!,This little item is easy to assembly and use. Makes great water for my fish.I'm glad I bought it!! Donna
1,Horrible Odor,"Used this filter a few times and it worked well until it suddenly started to cause the filtered water to smell something akin to a strong chemical cat urine odor. I had added some water to a fish tank and the tank smelled rank. As a result, I had to change out the tank and add clean unfiltered water. I think the fish are okay. I will throw the unit away as it also is causing the entire room to smell awful. Total waste of money and I hope I didn't harm the fish by using this product."
1,Returned it,"I Had to return this product. It did not work properly. Too bad, I was looking forward to using it."
1,why you changed the post service but i did not know!!!,the postage is expensive than the item!and anybody did not let me know that!!!whay you do that did not tell me!!!
5,More Powerpuff Girls!,"This video pack of the Powerpuff Girls was a suprise for my children. They enjoy watching these so with more than 1 video in this group there will be hours of fun. Thanks so much for carrying these as a set & reasonably priced, too. RL"
2,Tedious example of HK humor missing the mark,"I am a great fan of goofy. Chow Yun-fat at his dopiest is always fine with me. The inane excesses of ""The killer"" and ""The Chinese feast"" (Jin yu man tang) delight me. But this is simply dreary. And it's such a shame, since I generally enjoy these actors. Here they huff and puff and make faces and it's just not funny. Avoid this one."
2,"Same old, same old","Fourteen billion different compilations later and BMG/RCA continues to offer little of what as been out of print for years. Most of these songs are readily available elsewhere, but BMG/RCA is just too lazy to go digging for songs that are less common and more worth hearing. This particular compilation isn't the worst, and it actually has a notable highlight or two (""To Daddy"" comes to mind) but by and large it is just same old, same old."
5,This one is really fine.,"I've been a three-penny freak ever since I was a hanger-on at a Stanford production 40 years ago directed by a Brecht associate from Berlin. It's wonderful to get the authentic original cast records. I really like the added Berlin Chansons, too. ""Don't Goggle at that Tango Dancer, Keep Your Eyes on the Guy You Came with!"" Or Marlene Dietrich, with ""Jonny, When it's Your Birthday, I'll Be Your Guest for a Night."""
3,Acceptable but a bit disappointing,"I used to have the whole Dreigroschenoper on LP's a long long time ago. This recording is not as good, but it seems to be the best that is currently available."
5,Queen Rocks On In True Royal Style!,"I own the original version of this concert on VHS and I must say the commemorative release of ""WE WILL ROCK YOU"" is a must have for all Queen fans, if not for the rare (not included on the VHS original release) of ""Jailhouse Rock."" The band is playing at their best and this concert is only topped by their earlier 1970's stuff. Queen is at the top of their game. Music fans and players could learn a few things from Queen in this wonderful DVD!"
2,Not DTS,The DVD that I received ordered from this page was NOT DTS.This is the main reason I bought it. Overall the DVD was ok but no comparison to professional DVD recordings by Styx or The Eagles.
2,"Queen was OK, but the quality is terrible","Queen gave a good show, but the sound quality is very poor. Besides, the audience is pretty turned off, and the don't even sing along the lyrics. If you want a great Queen video, get Live At Wembley, or the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert."
2,"Good concert, poor to average DVD","I am a big Queen fan, this DVD is OK but nothing compared to my other DVDs in terms of sound/Picture quality. The people that think this has good sound probably dont have the system I have. Freddie exceded himself during the concert by singing with his mouth shut (I think the dubbing got out of control at that point)."
2,Doesn't do Queen justice,"When I first saw this at the store, I wondered why it was released on DVD. This has always been the worst of the Queen live videos, but that's not their fault. Queen play as well as ever, but it seems that both the audience and the audio engineers were asleep for the whole show. Even in 5.1 digital audio, the sound is horrid. The drums and bass are completely lost throughout, as if you're listening to it through a drive-in theater speaker. And the audience...good Lord, they don't even know the words to ""Love of My Life"" (as Freddie dejectedly points out during the song). More than once he tries to coerce them to stand or even clap their hands, but to no avail. So avoid this one, as much as I hate to say it, and start bugging Hollywood Records to release Live at Wembley or Rock in Rio...tapes that do Queen justice."
1,Not up to par,"I got this DVD expecting the full, rich sound Queen os known for. I was seriously disappointed. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Queen We Will Rock You DTS,Finally we get to see and hear the greatest act on earth on DVD and in DTS 5.1!The new DTS mix is clearer and more consistent in sound with the vocals especially advantaged by the DTS makeover.Picture quality is the best I've seen of this 20 year old footage.A wonderful performance from the four greatest human beings ever to live. An absolute must!
2,The Boys Must Have Been Hung Over,"I bought this DVD to get a sense of how Queeen did a live performance never having seen them in person. After viewing the concert, I thought they performed at several levels below their best effort.Sometimes live concerts result in a more energetic and better product than studio recorded music. This live effort was spotty at best with Freddie doing a little too much improvising, and Brian missing some of his great guitar licks (badly) especially in ""Bohemian Rhaposody"". Also, what happened in the middle of that song? I think the great harmony part was ""dubbed in"" since one only sees a lot of smoke (and mirrors) onstage with the band nowhere to be seen. Altogether a disappointment........."
1,horrible,"I have loved freddie for almost 25 years and this dvd is a waste of money. It has poor quality and sound. If you work for a living, save your money and buy champions of the world."
2,Do not buy this for anyone!,"I have to say I am a HUGE Queen fan. I gave this to someone as a christmas present. I later borrowed it from her, because I had never seen it. I must say I was embarrassed that I gave it to her. Freddy Mercury has a voice that you either love or hate (and I love it), but on this he sounds like he is singing underwater. The show itself is good and I like Freddies camp style (which is why I give it two stars instead of one)"
4,A Truly Dynamic Performance,"Love it or hate it? There doesn't seem to be any in between. Given the comments so far, I think the consensus is that the music is fantastically good, and the production quality isn't. Of course, this is unfair. The video is only as good as the film it was made from. That is not the fault of the DVD. The sound is far better than some have claimed. If they had the system I have and then tweaked it to take into consideration that this is not a sparkling new digital production, they would be more than satisfied. I have played this for friends and it has blown them away."
3,"Queen Rocks, DVD does not","To me Queen was one of the best live bands I have ever seen play live and although the performance here is when they were really rockin' sometimes I just can't get past the poor sound quality - and yes I have the updated DTS version. The songs are great, seing Brian on the piano for Save Me brings back great memories. They really need to release some concerts from the 70's (like Hyde Park and Earl's Court)- that's the REAL Queen, even though I love the Wembley DVD (how about a Knebworth video?)"
2,Don't blame DTS,"This is definitely NOT the DTS version. The sound is definitely less than desirable and quite shallow. That said, be on the lookout for the DTS DVD-Audio disc of Queen's ""A Night at the Opera"". (I think it's coming out sometime in the beginning of 2002). I've heard a couple of tracks and it is absolutely breath-taking. And even though it's a DVD-A, they still have the original ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" video on there that will blow you away. The guys at DTS definitely know how to do surround sound."
3,The screen resolution is way lower than I spected,There's no such a big difference watching between the old VHS version of this concert in Montreal and this dvd. Although some Queen fans could apreciate the additional features such the places concerning this group.
4,Queen lives on dvd.,"What a concert dvd this is of queen preforming their songs live , but i wish they would have tight in there harmonies ,besides that it one rockin show even though in the people there looked bored. i enjoy every minute of it well almost every minute the first we will rock i did'nt like it does'nt sounded like the record but the reprise does i love it gives me goose bumps all over & crazy little thing called love cooks i'm not putting down the others, but those are my favorites . if i had to rate this i'd rate it very good . PG-13 for lanaguage if anyone want to know or are worry about getting this disc."
1,"No Energy, Not Much of a Concert","This concert DVD was extremely disappointing. The performance left much to be desired. The members of Queen seemed to be just going through the motions with little or no connection with the audience or each other. Except for brief moments from Freddy Mecury, there was little or no energy in the performance.As far as the quality of the DVD, it was OK, but there were times when the sound didn't seem quite in sync with the video.Don't bother buying this DVD. Even hard core Queen fans will find little enjoyable about this concert."
3,"Great performance, but really bad renditions of the songs!","My hubby and I were pretty disappointed with this. We know the songs really well and it's liek Freddie forgot how they went. He changed them all so they were only recognizable by the music behind it. He has beer all over the top of his piano so maybe it's cause he was drunk, but it was not good at all. Every song he pretty much ruined. Still love Queen, but the way he did the songs in this concert sucked big time!The quality of the DVD seemed pretty decent. I have nothign to compare it to really besides movies on DVD, but I saw no issues with this recording."
4,Classic Rock at its Energetic Best!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This show is great.Filmed professionally pre-live aid,it offers a glimps at one of Freddie Mercury's best performances. END"
5,They Are The Champions!,"I loved it! Queen, and Freddie Mercury, at their very best!Awesome performances of such titles as ""Love of My Life"", ""Under Pressure"", Roger Tyler singing ""I'm In Love With My Car"", ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" just to name a few.Freddie shows of his sense of humor, and wit, and made it an even more enjoyable performance.A must, for any Queen fan."
4,"Pretty good, but not really ""Queen""","By far, this isn't the best you will ever hear from the greatest live band of all time, but it's good enough, I guess. The Montreal audience is pitiful, failing to respond to almost anything and not knowing the words to ""Love of My Life"". There is the ""Killer Queen"" problem where film and sound are different. However, if you're just looking for kind of a 'Greatest Hits Live' DVD, this is just fine. Lacking old classics like ""Stone Cold Crazy"" and ""Liar"", however. If you can get your hands on a performance from earlier days, I would recommend that. Still, this is a great DVD, and if the concert would have been performed to a more enthusiastic audience, I would have given it 5 stars."
3,Fantastic Band but the DTS sound is terrible,"I am a very big Queen fan since is saw them in 1975. It was my very first live concert and since I was about eleven the memory has stayed with me since.I ordered the DTS version as I prefer this sound format over Dolby Digital, but I must say that the DTS version is terrible.It sound like Roger Taylor is playing a toy set of drums. There is hardly any surround sound coming from the rears, just a very thin crowd sound.It is the worst soundtrack I have ever heard, there is no depth at all to it and I would hazard a guess that it has been encoded wrong.The Dolby Digital version on the disc is better, but as I opted specifically for the DTS version it seems a bit pointless.This is a real shame as the video quality is fantastic and..apart from the crowd being a little apathetic in places,the show is really great.If DTS had put a ounce of the dedication that Freddie put into his shows then we would have had something special to remember the band by."
4,Queen Will Really Rock You!,"I got this tape last year as a gift. I put it on and was returned to Madison Square Garden where I've seen Queen many times as a young lad. The show starts off with a blistering version of ""We will rock you"". The boys then mix the musical sets from old and new tunes. During ""get down'make love"", Roger performs an incredible drum/timpani solo. Of course Brians guitar solo is delightfully magical. Freddie as always steals the show, exhibiting his incredible vocal range. Songs include an acoustic set including ""love of my life"". From one guitar and one voice to an all out assault of your senses by these rock and roll gods...er...Queens.-A truly remarkable show captured on video. A must for any fan of classic rock."
2,If you were expecting great sound better buy a cassette,"Most than half the movie I resisted the temptation of turning off that awful sound and began a break dance on the DVD.Freddy would hide of shame.This DVD are live performances, with bad shoot places.If I have not bought it, I wouldnt finish seeing it, thats sad because I personally would give ten stars to Queen itself."
2,Good for historical purposes only...,Dissapointing video overall. The sound quality jumps in and out as other people have noted. It's not the quality of my audio system - it's the DVD itself. This thing is bootleg quality at best. If you're a big fan you'll still like it though.
5,Queen fan must buy this DVD,"The quality of video and sound of this DVD is unbeatable. The package looks cheap, though. I surely buy it again if I lost it."
3,Spongebob Pinball Tabletop,"Not as fun as I thought. Best for the older child-over 7 yrs. old. Not easy to keep ball in play even for me. Should be easier, I think, since it is a child's toy. Kind of frustrating to get the ball to the right to pull the plunger and put ball into play. Sometimes works great, sometimes have to try 2 to 3 times to move the ball over to the right. It is an ""OK"" toy."
5,A Must buy!,"Great durable case, with neat zipper pocket on the top and sub compartment inside. Very happy with purchase. Fits my c725 perfectly !"
4,Camera case for Olympus C755,"Good deal I got from Amazon.Plus the packaging is good.May not be the best of the cases around, but it holds the camera pretty well and also allows you to carry a pack of extra batteries and memory chips.Material is soft and provides a good cushion to the camera on the inside."
4,Olympus Camera Case,Fits camera well. Extra pouch on top holds extra batteries and cards nicely. I like the adjustable strap.
3,case is just ok,"The camera fits great in the case and it has a place for holding an extra card but, there is just a velcro closure for the top and sometimes it opens unexpectedly causing everything to fall out."
4,camera case,"the camera case was as expected. no complaints, and I searched for the best price on this item, and found it here. I just think that the shipping charges are way too high. I know that the sellers charge these rates, but I believe that they should reconsider. It is not unusual for the shipping charges to exceed 50% of the price for an item (such as this one) that is not so expensive. In the future, I will be giving my business to sellers that have no shipping (or low shipping charges). and you should too."
2,Top heavy,"Bag is ok but you must be careful if your moving around a lot. With extra batteries in the top zip compartment it is really top heavy and tips upside down while on your shoulder if the camera is out of it. The velcro does not hold it closed well either. My memory card fell out of the bag during one of these episodes , Thank goodness my husband noticed."
4,Just Right,Not to big or to small. Lightly padded with a small compartment to hold an extra battery.
5,Absorbing,I do not think anyone can claim to be a student of the history of India without having read this account. It reveals many unknowns and is a masterpiece.
4,FOR THOSE WHO APPRECIATE THIS KIND OF MUSIC WILL BE IN 7th HEAVEN!,"No, It never graced Billboard's Pop Charts, No 'Hit' Singles released, but a very enjoyable album for this period (Early 60's). If you're a lover of the lady's voice.....You'll be VERY pleased!!! And then being backed by The Andre Previn Trio doesn't hurt either."
2,"Find another cd for ""Porgy and Bess""",I really like the music to Porgy and Bess but this one is a totally different variation. I didn't like all the jazz music and her voice didn't come across very well. I couldn't even understand some of the words. There must be a better one out there.
1,"Yeah, Right...","I could not wait to finish this book...so I could start reading a realistic one. The idea sounded great, the writing was a huge disappointment. Even taking into consideration it is over 30 ears old, it is so farfetched and the main character is one of the dumbest ""heros"" I've seen. The ending, when I finally got to it, was disappointing....I expected more from the author of the 7th Secret."
2,Adequately interesting but nothing memorable.,"This story concerns the adventures of several people on a future Earth that is under the power of a computer that can only be ""turned off"" when five rings are found and brought to a special place. The protagonists' virtual lack of free will takes away from the story's efficacy."
4,Great set that gets tons of compliments...,"We bought this flatware a few months ago and we are still delighted with it. Unlike the previous reviewer, we do not find it at all uncomfortable or awkward to hold. It is attractive and looks as fabulous now as when we bought it, despite frequent use and dishwasher cleaning. I highly recommend this set. It is a much better value to find a retailer that sells the larger set (63 pieces can be found for $299)."
4,The awesome power of The PUSA...,"""Volcano"" alone is worth the twelve bucks; the ""Sgt. Pepper"" reference was clever as well. But this CD: it will not disappoint."
3,Not up to par,"It is a wholly uninspired album. Their first self-titled album and pure frosting are great, but no matter how much I want to like this one, it just doesn't seem to work for me. Buy the other two. Ignore this one as an unfortunate fluke."
3,2 1/2 stars.. maybe,"I know I'm more of a ""hits"" person, but I also like the non-hits of groups and on CDs with hits (or in this case, no known hits that I have heard of). So I was thinking about how catchy ""Peaches"" and ""Lump"" are by the Presidents and saw this album in a trading store. It's a good thing I only paid $5 for this because as much as I enjoy their unique style (one that is an acquired taste for some), I found this album had lacked catchy songs, only a few of them I found okay (which names fail me at the moment). I'd save your money and buy it cheap if you really feel the need to spin this disc. But hey, why not listen to some of the samples and see for yourself?"
2,Whoops - no ideas left over for the 2nd CD,"The debut CD of POT USA was fantastic - 5 stars. It remainsa fresh-sounding classic. Unfortunately, the follow-up triedto repeat the same formulas and ideas but didn't do it as well.The songwriting is struggling and repetitive on this one. Avoid."
3,Rare giallo film,"I love this film! What you find being sold might be a dvd-r version!!! Be warned!!! If you're a hardcore ""giallo"" fan, this film is a great addition to your collection. It has been officially released, but the high price one from Eurovista is a dvdr. Search for the official release (on Code Red) of this item."
3,Code Red DVD Review,"After the Eurovista edition comes this new dvd from Code Red of the italian thriller ""L'Etrusco Uccide Ancora"" (The Etruscan Kills Again) by Armando Crispino. The cover incorretly states anamorphic, format is 2.31:1 letterboxed 16/9 enhanced; the image is quite strong but a little soft and there are numerous scratches and little signs of wear around the reel changes. The audio is muddy at times but dialogue remains clear. No menus whatsoever the movie begins with a trailer as intro. Region 0 NTSC"
2,boring.,"I'm a huge fan of horror, Italian horror and giallo but I could not get into this movie. It did nothing for me. I tried to watch it but stopped each time. Maybe ill give it another chance though."
3,"Good buy, but could be better.","This is an OK product which could have been a really good but for the lack of some key features and attention to detail.The good: Digital tuning, good metal build, clockradio function, decent speaker sound (for a little radio), good FM reception, mediocre-average AM reception, good led flashlight, good headphone sound, use of AA (vs AAA) batteries) thus getting longer use. This has some shortwave capability but I wouldn't want to rely on it for that purpose.Bad or poor: sloppy tuning dial, fiddly switches/knobs too small to use well, NO STEREO through headphones.Would be nice: a light for the tuning dial, a beeper for the clock for times when you don't want a radio.Still for $10.00 it's a pretty good buy. If you want a better pocket radio, try the Kaito KA11Kaito Pocket-Size PLL Synthesized AM/FM Shortwave Radio, KA11. It's better in all categories and not much bigger but 4 times the price."
3,"Tiny and fun, but inadequate","The Kaito KA202L radio is extremely simple to operate. A tuning knob, a volume dial, and a band switch is all you'll need to know. However, this inexpensive radio is too much of a gamble. The digital frequency display does not show enough precision on shortwave to help you find the signal you want. The speaker is tiny and has limited frequency response. The antenna is not strong enough to pull in many shortwave signals; a clip-on antenna can help here somewhat.If you are considering purchasing this radio, I would instead suggest that you give strong consideration to the Kaito WRX911. That radio is a bit more complicated to operate due to the analog tuning display, but it has a much more capable speaker and the antenna is good enough to give you adequate reception of strong signals on shortwave. The WRX911 is more expensive than the KA202L, but the extra cost is justified due to the higher quality product."
3,Good am/fm radio,"This radio works fine as a radio. Battery life is good as well as reception.But since the world went digital short wave is no more and there is no need to sell a short wave as part of the product, as it si no more."
4,response,Response to reviewer above: I'm guessing... tou can hook it up to a 7.1 speaker but this cable will not make sound come out of all 7 speakers + adjust to surround sound settings
5,Love it,"See other review best peelers around. It makes less work out of a niserable job. Yea, yea yea more words required."
4,This baby peels tomatoes!,"No more blanching! It is just amazing. I saw them using it on America's Test Kitchen and could not believe it. But it works. The only caveat is that if you're peeling 8 or 10, say for sauce, blanching is still quicker. And for everything else, the OXO peelers are still the best, especially the new ""i"" series swivel model. But for that ""one tomato, peeled and seeded"" recipes, this is it."
5,The Number One gift for every new bride's kitchen...,"should be this little beauty. Could not believe that it worked exactly as I saw it demonstrated (after I figured out that I needed to remove the piece of tape over the edges) on my favorite cooking show..ATK (a/k/a AmericasTestKitchen.com.) Told my daughter about it and now she, plus friends, are going to order some. Everyone should own one! Plan to order other items, soon."
5,Scarlett,Excellent always loved gone with the wind and this was great. you get to know more about the characters and was happened to them after the end of gone with the wind.
2,Poor Packaging,"For the first one I received, the plastic covering the case was in terrible condition...all buckled and wrinkled like it had melted. So I returned it and was sent another. Outside packaging was improved, but both discs inside were not attached to the spindle. They were just loose and sliding around in the case. One of the spindles was broken and it apparently scratched the disc, because when I watched it, there was one section that had both sound and picture deficiencies.As for the movie itself, I liked and enjoyed it very much."
3,Go Read the Book...,The movie is ok but if you want a really fantastic story - read the book. I was very disappointed by how the movie does not follow the book. The murder trial was so different. So much more is involved in the book than could possibly be covered in the movie.
4,"Not GWTW, but still pretty good","Okay Gone With the Wind fans, we all know that Scarlett can't be compared to GWTW. We know that Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton can't be compared to Vivan Leigh and Clark Gable. The books don't even have the same author, for crying out loud. But inspite of these facts, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I believe that despite the fact that they're not Leigh and Gable, Whalley and Dalton have excellent chemistry. This movie is based upon more of the relationship between Rhett and Scarlett than the politics of the day (except for the Irish movement.) But as another reveiwer stated, this movie has a much more satisfying ending.So if you enjoyed GWTW, I urge you to at least watch if not buy Scarlett. Hey, even if you're a stickler for minute details, you'll at least know what happened to your favorite characters."
3,discontect it from the book and it would be a good movie,If the movie would not have been a sequel then this would have been a great movie. I was disapointed in the ending only because I had read the book first. Now after watching it over (and over) again I have come to enjoy the ending to the movie too.
3,"okay, but not true to the book","I greatly enjoyed both the book and the movie GWTW. I read the book Scarlett as well. The ending of the movie was entirely different!! I thought the rape and involvement of Mary w/ Sean Bean's character was totally unnecessary. The way Scarlett's priest cousin dies is also better in the book. The show itself was well done, but it changed too much from the book. I think the character of Scarlett was also altered a bit. She never actually grew up very much. Altogether, I'm glad I saw it and we probably won't find a movie that can live up the original epic."
1,Not worthy of the name!,"GWTW the book is fabulous. GWTW the movie was excellent. Scarlett the book was entertaining and this Mini-series is simply not worthy. Although the plot generally follows Alexandra Ripley's novel, it deviates several times for the worse. JWK is not who I'd like to see as Scarlett but gave a bearable performance. (providing she wore contacts, which she did not) TD was an absolutly, not very good Rhett. There was nothing resembling Rhett Butler about him or his acting. The bloody rape and murder scene was completely unneccsary and ruined the entire thing. Generally, anything considering the plot of this mini-series is bad. I did however enjoy Jean Smart and Anne Margaret. They where the light of this awful mistake. GWTW fans should see this so that they can appreciate the GWTW book, movie and written sequal all the more"
1,No Stars At All (Would like to leave the rating blank),"To call ""Scarlett"" the sequel to Gone With The Wind took a lot of gall! I've read Alexandra Ripley's book and watched the movie and tried to capture the GWTW essence, but as hard as I tried to like the book AND the movie (Scarlett), I can't bring myself to give it any rating at all. Let's just leave it where Rhett left Scarlett at the door saying, ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."" It's kept audiences guessing for over 60 years, and the magic of GWTW never faded. ""Don't fix it when it ain't broke."""
5,Scarlett,"I read the book, watched the TV mini-series,and bought the movie. I gave my Gone with the Wind DVD and Scarlett VHS tape to my daughter, replaced them and now I've ordered the rerelease of the DVD to replace my vhs tape. Thought this was a great movie."
1,By far the most horrible movie I have EVER seen,"If I could I would give this movie no stars.The people that made this movie completely butchered the book. I honestly wish that they had just not made Alexandra Ripley's book into such a horrid display. Not only do they stray SOOOO far from the story, the characters that portray Scarlett and Rhett completely overact and are a mockery to GWTW.What a waste of time and money. Way to go William Hanley, You royally botched it up and took away 6 (more or less) hours of my life I will never get back."
3,"The first half is okay, the second half isn't.","I liked the first part of this movie, even though it did take some liberties with the book (it didn't have the woodland witch character, for example... and Scarlett's grandmother was the one who actually performed the Cesarian section on Scarlett.) But, the second half... with the murder of Lord Fenton and that trial?? What the heck? THAT DID NOT HAPPEN IN THE BOOK. And it wouldn't have been that difficult to stay true to the book's story for the movie!Don't get me wrong, the movie is okay in and of itself, but anyone who was expecting it to be like the book will surely be disappointed."
1,Totally dissapointed,"Ok so I knew this wouldn't be anywhere near as good as 'Gone With The Wind' but wow, they just totally changed personalities and everything. But that's not the worst of it!! The dvd itself wouldn't play right, it would skip and the picture would flicker and scramble. I didn't really enjoy it at all."
2,"Well, it didn't even come close!",As many other GWTW fans..I craved more of Scarlett and Rhett.. and wanted a happy ending for it all. I read the book Scarlett.. and was happy and quite sad. Seems that the original haunts you (I am a big fan!) and Scarlett left you a bit disapointed. I dont think that the best of actors could have pulled off what we the fans expected.. but it did give me what most of GWTW fans wanted.. a happy ending.. right?
2,Did they even read the book?,"So poor quality that it is embarrassing that they call it a ""sequel"" to Gone With the Wind. The story line is very weak and completely follows a re-write from the novel."
2,Not as good as the book,The costumes are pretty good but they completely change the story and this actor doesn't do Rhett justice.
3,Quality concern,The movie itself was good. The quality of the DVD was not. Loud static occurred during the last have of the DVD.
3,Scarlett,I was disappointed....the DVD was rated a Region 2....not a Region 1 and it would not play in myDVD player. I notified Amazon and the seller and was allowed to return the DVD to the seller.I am still interested in finding the DVD of Scarlett(Region 1)
2,technical problems,I've loved this movie ever since I saw it on CBS years ago so I was really excited to own it on DVD. Unfortunately the experience was ruined when I discovered that there are big sound problems on the second disc. Loud popping sounds completely cover up the dialogue in an entire scene. I was very dissapointed.The movie is great but the sound problems aren't worth the purchase. Stay away!
2,GWTW sequel does not measure up.,"I enjoyed reading the book, but was disappointed by the mini-series. I found the cast lackluster, failing to inspire the passion of GWTW. The terrible attempts to imitate Irish and Southern accents were distracting."
1,"Scartlet, Could not watch it in the usa. , so it is useless to me. Wish I could get my money back or a different copy they woul","I could not watch this movie on my tv. because it was sent from over seas or made overseas, it cannot be viewed here. Very disappointed but you have to watch what you buy. I assume it is my fault. Will never do it again."
3,An Okay movie,"This movie was okay.It was not what I exspected but okay.If you like soap operas this may be for you.I loved Gone with the Wind,it was a classic.Scarlett really should not have been made because Margret Mitchell didn't finish it and the original cast was gone and too good to replace.My advice is to see Gone With the Wind and if you are ready for Scarlett go ahead but it may be a disappointment.Oh and watch the movie then read the book Scarlett because it will be a bigger disappointmen since the book was quite different than the movie.Hope you like it!"
3,Okay,I liked the first part of the movie. I think It showed all of Scarlett's determination but I hated the ending. I don't know what was wrong with the ending of the book. I did not like all the rape and murder. I was not nessasary I think it was more romantic in the book because Rhett came looking for Scarlett
3,It was a pretty good show,"I like the way they brought Scarlett from the innocent, selfish life to reality, but they took away alot of her innocence, and selfishness. She hardly does any scheming. It is one thing to make her into a woman, but to completely take away all of her childness eliminates the true Scarlett, the one we have come to love."
2,Read the book 1st if you want to be disappointed,"When I purchased this movie I thought it would live up to the character of the book. I was sadly mistaken. It seems like when this script was written ""they"" decided to take the book and use the ideas from the book and not the book itself. This movie doesn't capture the spirit of Scarlett. I recommend that if you are to buy this movie - don't read the book first."
5,Scarlett,"My favorite movie ever!!!Great story, beautiful picture, Scarlett's character you just cant get enough of her! Red Buttler awesome choice if actor. Incredible movie for when you are feeling down and tired and not only,it give you strength and uplift you. It makes you wana watch it over and over again. Totaly recommended!!!"
5,Scarlett DVD,"This movie is fantastic, wonderful story line, acting supberb, hated to have it end , Gone With The Wind is my ALL time favorite, now I have a SECOND all time favorite. It is a MUST BUY."
4,Pretty Good,"A huge GWTW fan myself, I truly enjoyed reading ""Scarlett."" This movie was good, but the book is much better. A great ending to a wonderful story."
1,Complete Injustice to Gone With The Wind,"After reading the book Scarlett, I was excited to see the movie based on it. Or, well, it's supposed to based on the book. I watched this movie in complete horror as it remade the entire storyline of Scarlett. All of the main plot in the book disappears in the movie; Fenton takes the main stage, leaving Scarlett's maturity and Cat completely in the background. If you are really interested, read the book instead, it does Gone With the Wind much better juctice than this movie."
2,so dissappointed,"The character of scarlett is just plain awful...she doesn't even have green eyes...did the director even read GWTW or Scarlett, Timothy Dalton is not so much of a bother. The Scarlett book sequel was slightly different than expected by Alexandra Ripley but the movie was just way out in left field-not so much the story but just the actors...do watch it if your a fan just like I am but don't hold your expectations too high, in this movie Scarlett is not likable, not beautiful, and not endearing to us and the feeble attempt she makes at talking like a southerner is irritating...why the directors chose English actors is a mystery to me??? Timothy is handsome and big of course and he fits Rhett decent-not Clark Gable of course but still I know none of us expect either of them to equal Vivien Leigh or Clark but it would have been nice to at least seen a good attempt for a novel that was a sequel to such a phenomenal book like GWTW."
1,Horrible,"This movie was horrible! Not only did they distort the book, but they made it into something sordid. The first half of the movie remaind more or less true to the book, but it just went steeply downhill from there. Fenton was nothing like he was in the book; he was a sick evil man. Cat also did not play the major role she did in the book. I'll never see this movie again and am throughly sorry I bought it."
2,Extremely Dissapointed,"The movie is EXTREMELY different from the book, but it was good in its own way. Too bad I didn't get to see how it ended because something was wrong with tape two and my VCR refused to play the last 30 min of it."
2,fiddle dee dee,this movie is not anything like GWTW. I fast forwarded through most of it. If you want a happy GWTW ending then fast forward to the last 3 minutes of the movie.
1,Better Than Gone With the Wind,"Perhaps there are many who would not agree with me, but I enjoyed Scarlett more than the original. I thought the actors were every bit as good, if not better, and there was an excellent plot."
5,I love this movie!!,"I've always been a fan of Gone With the Wind so when I heard of a sequal airing on television, I was there every night watching it unfold. I loved it then so much that I ran out and got the dvd as soon as it was available. I loved seeing what happened to Scarlett and Rhett and what tommorow really brought. All the actors did a fantastic job portraying these wonderful characters. The sets, locations and costumes were just amazing. I also fully enjoyed the behind the scenes making of the film included with the dvd. A must see for any fan of these cool characters!!"
5,Very satisfying,"After the abrupt, and almost inconclusive, ending to GWTW I found great satisfaction with the ending to Scarlett. You were, however, led through many plots along the way sugesting a similar ending to the first. Even with the supposed non-relation to the book Scarlett, for someone who has not read it and has seen GWTW, you will not be dissapointed. The indepth plot and new twists every minute engulfs the viewer with hurt, anger, frustration, fear and relief almost to the point where you will wish the 6 hour movie was longer. Amazing movie."
3,"Although great, it lacks a few things mentioned in book","Yes, like those who enjoyed the movie, I have found that it lacks a few things that were mentioned in the book. For example, in the book it mentions a few children from Scarlett's previous marriages. Also they changed somethings that would have made more sence than what was written in the script. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but I feel that these few things that were either left out completly left out or changed would have made the movie a tad better."
3,moderete,"I read both Gone With The Wind and Scarlett, and I thought that both of the book were very well written, but when the movie version of Scarlett came out I was very dissapointed. They did a wonderful job in the casteng department but the story line was a little off. I hope that they will make another version of Scarlett soon"
4,Rhett and Scarlett live again!,"I had such a good time watching this film! Scarlett grows up and finds a life for herself, with many dangers in between!Joann Whalley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton are very believable as Scarlett and Rhett.Don't listen to the nay-sayers about this movie..judge for yourself!"
2,"Blue-eyed Rhett, brown-eyed Scarlett?","I was sorely disappointed in this mini-series. It was not true to Alexandra Ripley's book, which in turn was not true to the original GWTW. The whole murder and trial plot line was bizarre. Why did Belle Watling appear in Charleston? Rhett with blue eyes, Scarlett with brown eyes? Whoever wrote the screenplay was not familiar enough with the original material to realize what details were just not meant to be messed with. Okay as a television drama, but it doesn't live up to its association with GWTW. If you love Gone with the Wind, the characters of Rhett and Scarlett, or just want to see the screen adaptation of the book Scarlett, avoid this movie, you will be disappointed too."
4,"Fun, if a tad disappointing too","At first, I couldn't get into believing the character of Scarlett. My problem with her was her brown eyes. This may not sound like it should be a problem, but if you're a fan of the novels you know that there is much emphasis on the beauty of her green eyes. This was very important to me, as I'm sure it is to others. Why they couldn't give the actress a pair of colored lenses is beyond my understanding.There is simply no comparasion to Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, to try and do so would be impossible. If you watch the movie without trying to compare everything to GWTW, you might just enjoy yourself. Overlooking the fact that this actress has brown eyes, I did soon come to like and enjoy these two actors and believed them to be Rhett and Scarlett. It was a good bit of fun, and I believe it is worth the money to add this DVD to your collection."
1,scarlett o'hara has BLACK HAIR & GREEN EYES,Duh! Could they find an actress with green eyes? Or buy contacts for the new scarlett??? This movie is awful...the book is a little better...
4,A lot better than Ripley's book!,"This is a fun movie, very soap operaish. It does what Ripley's book didn't and put Rhett right in the middle of the action. It also more believably portrays Scarlett's and Rhett's love for each other than the book did and has a plot that's easier to follow. Stop whining about how it doesn't measure up to Gone with the Wind. I wasn't expecting an Academy Award winning movie when I bought this. I wanted a happy ending to Rhett and Scarlett and that's exactly what I got."
2,Not dissappointed but not satisfied,"After watching Scarlett and having read the book twice, I am here to tell you the movie and the book are competly two different things. THere are numerous mistakes in the movie. Scarlett didn't have green eyes and her eyes are the thing that draws men to her, they could of atleast put eye color contacts in and I was dissappointed in the Rhett they chose and how they presented him in the movie. They made him too soft. In the book, the trial of when Scarlett is commented of murder doesn't even happen. Its like they didn't even try to keep it faithful to Gone With The Wind, let alone the book, Scarlett is portrayed as a strong-headed woman, in the movie during the end she is portrayed weak and ends up letting a man beat and rape her which Scarlett would never do and THAT didn't even happen in the book. As a movie, it was ok but as a sequel to Gone With The Wind, absoutly a failer, and trying to be faithful to the book, they did an awful job."
3,pretty good,"i watched this movie the other day after i watched gone w/ the wind. i thought that the movie was good and that joanne whalley did as good of a job as anyone could do. lets face it there is only one vivien leigh and no one is going to measure up, but i think that joanne did a good job. joanne wasn't quite as sassy and selfish as vivien's scarlett which i missed. timothy dalton looked just like clark gable with that devilish grin but wasn't as quick tempered and passionate as clark was. oh and what is the deal w/ him marrying that stupid ann girl or whoever in the movie? um i don't think so. has the person who wrote that part in ever seen gone w/ the wind. that was definitely a mistake. all in all, scarlett was pretty good and i think that it takes a lot of guts to make sequel to gone w/ the wind. everyone has to at least respect that."
2,Ummmmm.......,This movie had nothing to do with the book Scarlett. I am an eighth grader and I just finished reading the books amonth ago so I decided to rent the movie. Oh My Gosh! What a wast of my time. They changed the ending so much that I thought that maybe I had gotten the wrong move. My friend and I turned it in to a comedy though; we just laughed at it's stupidity. That was fun.
4,I thought it was good but not as good as GWTW,"I thoughtit was very good. VERY different from the book, which I read. It is not a movie for young children. I thoughtjoanne Whally Kilmore was better than Vivian Leigh."
4,The Wind Cant Rise Again,"After reading the reviews for the sequel to Gone With The Wind, all I can say is GET OVER IT!!!!! First of all Vivien is gone and so is Clark, Joanne Kilmer does the best she can and so does Timothy Dalton. The scenery and the costumes are beautiful althought they can never rival the brilliance of Selznicks demands on the set, the sequel brings a closing to the saga of the fall of the south and the Scarlett's emergence as a woman.Although the movie is very different from the book, it gracefully wraps up the story and the passion that is Rhett and Scarlett."
2,"uh, what in the world happened?","okay, i was so excited about seeing this movie, and the first half was okay, but what was with colum dying like that? and lord fenton being murdered, and scarlett getting arrested? where did all that come from? and the girl who played scarlett was not to my liking at all, she tried to do a southern accent, and it was terrible. the first half was pretty much straight by the book, but the last half really made me MAD! well, if you want to watch it i guess just don't compare it to the book, or the actors to Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. it just doesn't compare."
2,GWTW Comix,"It seems I remember reading somewhere that only the Bible has sold more copies than GWTW, among books, and no movie more admissions. Don't worry: this effrontery will never challenge anyone's or anything's record. It's to GONE WITH THE WIND as NEW TESTAMENT COMIX is to the Bible."
1,Not even close,"I have read Scarlett and GWTW and seen both movies. The Scarlett portrayed in the movie does not do justice to the character of Scarlett herself. Nor does Rhett. In my opinion the movie adaption of the book was right on. The book was horrible to begin with. The characters are just not the way they are supposed to act. As a movie by itself it was good, but as an accurate portrayal of Scarlett and Rhett, they couldn't of done any worse. I hope someday to see a sequel to GWTW that will give due credit to the beautiful spellbinding charaters the Mitchell created."
1,NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL,IT WAS BORING. I REALLY TRIED TO KEEP MY EYES OPEN. NO COMPARISON TO THE ORIGINAL MOVIE.
5,i loved this movie i watch it at least once a week,i loved gwtw but this movie is in some way better. i love the happy ending. i have not read the whole book but from what i have read the movie is much better. i know many books that are turned into movies and under go changes for effect. i think they did a marvolus job on this movie and would recomend it to anyone.
1,Awful...,"As a made for TV movie that comes on in the middle of the day on a Saturday afternoon that you watch because you don't feel like changing the channel, it was okay. As the sequel to GWTW or the screen adaptation of the book I enjoyed reading so much, it was appallingly AWFUL. The acting was weak, and the woman that played Scarlett was mildly attractive at best. It was a complete waist of time and money."
4,Great service,"I got it delivered quickly, we used it for vacation viewing. There was one little spot on the second tape that skipped for a second. Otherwise, great quality and service."
2,OK - but could be 10 times better,"I've read both GWTW and Scarlett, and was pleased with Ripley's sequel to the wonderful love story, but when the movie came out, I couldn't help but be disappointed. I hope that soon there will be another one made, but for the big screen, and they put a lot more effort into it and follow the book more closely. I would like to see people crying and enjoying ""Scarlett"" as much as they did ""Gone With the Wind"""
1,just horrible,"I was expecting a deviation from the book Scarlett, but never in my wildest thoughts did I ever imagine that the movie would be as altered from the book as it was. And it wasn't changed for the better. if it was just the plot maybe I wouldn't be so mad, but I feel that the characters were also changed in very drastic ways. i cannot believe how much they butchered a very enjoyable book."
4,Interesting,"Don't watch this in the hope of seeing Gone with the Wind again because you aren't. It deviates from the book at the end but wraps the show up much more nicely than the book. I enjoyed the movie and seeing what finally happened to Scarlett and the way she moves from place to place trying to get Rhett back is very typical of her. If you watch this show, make sure you watch the filming of it as you'll understand more of what it's about. I liked it as it completed a bit of a mystery."
3,"""Scarlett"" CD review",I was very disappointed in the story line. It deviated so much from the book and even had story lines entirely made up that were not in the book. A terrific movie could've been made by following the book instead of changing it and adding more sexual scenes to show on TV.
3,scarlett,"It was a very good sequal to the original except for the lead actress.Timothy Dalton was very good as rhett butler, but no Clark Gable. Tom Selleck might have been a better choice."
2,The story is fine,"Comparing with the prequel 'Gone with the Wind' this story is nothing. There are some part that annoy me and and also Rheet characther. How on earth his love interest changed so quickly from Scarlet to other girl. And for Rheet's new wife, i dont like her also, her characther is swallow for me. i know she likes Rheet but she doesnt respect Scarlett at all.Well for me the story is not good but that's only my opinion. And forgive my grammars also, English is my second langguage."
1,Part 1 and Part 1?,"I was very disappointed in this VHS. After watching the first VHS, I was very excited to watch the second half. To my dismay, the second VHS was exactly the same as the first one. Now, I do not have the ending."
1,bad tape,the tape had tracking problems. i realized it was a used tape. my fault i guess. i still watched it but it was annoying
4,Great Classic,"This was a great movie, almost better than Gone with the Wind. Just be sure you have the time to watch the 400 minutes."
2,Made a disaster of the book,"If you watch this please do not read the book first. I was so ready to enjoy this movie, because the book was so good. Timothy Dalton as always was great, but why in the hell did they have to rearrange half the book when they made this movie, and they added a slew of stuff not even in the book, it blew the whole thing. The movie starts out ok but gets worse as is goes. As long as you have not and will never read the book, this is an ok movie...but wow are you missing out if you don't."
3,"A major artist, an insightful text, but poor reproductions.","This book is undoubtedly the best available on Susan Rothenberg, even though it is far from perfect and stops at the year 1990. The text is a detailed appraisal of her career, with focuses on the critical reception, on her working process and on her sources of inspiration. Overall, this introduction is a high-quality text obviously written by a critic who knows and loves the work. However, the many illustrations (most of them in color) are at best average. A few fold-outs (for the horse paintings of the mid seventies) do stand out, but the book is devoid of any close-ups and therefore the reader does not get a chance to appreciate the artist's brushwork and the texture of the paintings. Slightly disappointing in this respect, maybe because the book was published 17 years ago and has not been updated since."
2,Caution: Audible electric buzz on recording,"While the playing is certainly excellent and spirited, there's unfortunately an annoying electric buzz on this recording - caused maybe by a fluorescent light or something else present in the room while it was being recorded. It's quite audible using headphones (and I've checked this on several different pieces of equipment, initially thinking it was my iPod or something had gone wrong when I added my CD to iTunes). Unfortunately, it's there. Buyer beware - you may find that you don't hear it on your stereo, in a room acoustic, but on headphones you'll hear it."
3,Dissapointing selection of pieces,"I was anticipating this album with excitement after reading the excellent reviews. The performances were very good, though heavy fingered on the cello at times, however other than the early cello sonata, which is the first piece, there were no other notable Beethoven masterpieces. The variations were dull and I was not moved by this 2 set album. The first piece on the album is the cello sonata. After that it declines steadily."
5,Originality at its best,"There are many opinions of Wispelwey's playing which seem to fall into two camps: those who love it and those who hate it. Personally, I fall into the former. Regardless of personal taste however, there is absolutely no denying the explosive originality and craftsmanship.Wispelwey's cellistic and musical personality is incredibly compatible with Beethoven's faceted music. The sudden changes in mood and dynamic are delivered convincingly and with a rich sound which is as diverse as the music he's playing.No matter your taste, this is a top quality recording."
1,Caution!,"MP3 version of this work contains only half of the original version (I mean this supposed to come with 2 CDs, but MP3 version contains only CD1). Three famous sonatas are not included. It is very disrespectful to MP3 music customer who cannot afford SACD."
4,a feel good jam,this jam was a banger from the word jump and it still is banging. Fat Joe and R.Kelly create a tight jam together that just shakes and has plenty of Musical bake. this is the jam I blast on a Summer sunny day.
3,Okay single,The single featured R.Kelly and it was just okay nothing to special are any thing I have never heard before.Lyrics 5/10 Production 7/10 Overall 6/10
2,kelly is faking the funk,okay kelly went from a bald head ... to gospel to pouring crystal on the ground wearing bandannas talkking about he's so thugged out this is sorry and singing old hooks from sesame street won't get you there either.
4,DOC In His Best Of Moods...,"Just Think, All His Best On One Album, Is That Not Great, Then I Don`t Know What Could Be Called Great..."
4,the songs are all good.the high points are ........,"first,long haired redneck.this is one of david allen coes best.tennesee whiskey is simple enough.he uses whiskeys to describe his woman.its a cool song,especialy if youre a drunk.its like............youre as smooth as tennesee whiskey............your as sweet as strawberry wine.............youre as warm as a glass of brandy..........its cool!the other song i really liked was the cover of a waylon jennings song called take this job and shove it.a lot of the outlaws have done this one.its a cool album."
1,They tear,They are pretty useless. They do not hold up and they are not slip proof. I work in my studio and have to replace them frequently. So it is a good thing there are so many of them. Would not buy them again.
4,Still functioning well after 6+ years,"This HP VS17E monitor came in a bundle with a Pentium desktop I started using back in 2005. It has performed admirably, and served me well in the past 6+ years.Some thoughts:* Good bright screen with easy to use buttons on the side of the monitor to customize aspects like contrast, color, brightness* It's fairly thin for a monitor made back in 2005. It's still considered thin.* Built in speakers aren't the best, but they certainly do the job.My mother now uses this desktop with this monitor and it's more than enough for normal computer surfing, email, watching videos. If the price is right (anywhere between $40 - $65), this is still a very good computer monitor option."
3,"Ghost images, and is not compatible with some resolutions","This monitor only functions at certain resolutions, and at the ones at which it does function, desktop icons appear to have ghost trails (at least on my machine). They're not too bad, and if you need a budget monitor, you might be able to deal with it. Heck, it may not even happen on your machine (mine is a Dell) but beware that this is not the highest quality (as reflected in the price) but it works, and it's cheap, so if you're not interested in super hi-rez quality, this will do the job."
2,A mildly entertaining light read,"This book is short enough to finish without feeling too much time has been wasted. The characters are shallow and unsympathetic, yet the story moves sufficiently quickly as to make it endurable. Sorry!"
2,Clever but rather shallow with a title that is bothersome,"The book is clever. The characters are shallow. The title ""East is East"" is bothersome. Kipling's words ""East is East and West is West and Never the Twain shall meet"" are well know. The author would be well advised to read a few more lines of Kipling's ""Ballad of East and West"".----------""East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet -- till earth and sky stand presently before God's judgement seat -- but there is neither East nor West, border nor breed nor birth --- When two strong men stand face to face though they come from the ends of the earth""."
1,Unfunny Cartoon,Has American literature really come to this? T.C. Boyle thinks that he is a latter day Swift. No way. He has merely created an unfunny cartoon.
5,One of the Best,"I have now read all of Boyle's work, except ""Riven Rock,"" which is next on my list. ""World's End"" was so great, I didn't think another of his books would be able to equal it. Yet, ""East Is East"" does. It's great, simpler than ""World's End,"" and just as interesting."
2,Not nearly as good as the reviews led me to believe,"The story revolves around a young Japanese/American ""half breed"" who flees from Japan to find himself in America. He's hoping to find acceptance in the great melting pot of America. Unfortunately he lands in redneck Georgia and is met with contempt and racism from the minute he washes ashore.It's all down hill from there for Hiro in his attempts to make it to the city of brotherly love.This book was given to me by a friend with assurances that I would love it. How wrong he was.I found the writing to be tedious and over done. Much of the time I spent reading I was thinking ""who cares?"". While the characters were well developed much of the book was spent on details that didn't seem to matter to the story.I would have just stopped reading it about 1/2 way through if I didn't have a hang up on not finishing a book I start. My recommendations on this book are to spend your money elsewhere."
3,East is East a wild romp,"Short story virtuoso TC Boyle weaves a wild tale about Hiro Tanaka, a half-Japanese half-American sailor who jumps ship from a Japanese freighter and makes it barely alive onto the Georgia coast. Fleeing the racism and time in the ship's brig off Japan, Tanaka arrives on a swampy island inhabited by the descendants of slaves, lower class whites, and the self-obsessed denizens of an artist colony.What ensues is at times hysterical: mistaken identity, self-delusion, pride, jealousy, hyperbole, and deceit. Tanaka, whose hippy mother became pregnant from a relationship with an American ""barbarian"", is taunted mercilessly as a ""gaijin"", though he was born and raised in Japan. He dreams of a place of half-castes and mixed-bloods, where he won't stand out. What he finds in America is misunderstanding and betrayal."
2,Hype Leads to Huge Disappointment,"My feelings about this book are based on hearing a two-audiotape abridgment, and that is always a major caveat. Nevertheless, I've heard plenty of abridged versions of books on tape that have propelled me toward the whole book. This one repelled me. The characters are tired cliches, the situations aren't terribly original, and the writing (the expressions used, the occasional metaphor) is sub-par. The main character, Hiro Tanaka, is oddly inconsistent. (I suppose you could say that about a lot of people, but why waste your time reading about them.) The fact that much of the action occurs in the artists' colony on a Georgian island is particularly a source of displeasure. Please, authors, stop writing about yourselves and your craft and your trade! Two points off just for that. Don't buy this book without giving it a good look-over first. A word to the wise..."
2,Takes FOREVER to receive,"This has finally arrived! It took 8 days.Upon inspection, it is much prettier in the picture than in person.the sizing is nice, and it stands up pretty tall. The amethyst stone is a beautiful rich purple, very natural looking, and the polished silver is very bright.My only complaints, and why I had to give it 2 stars:1. the well of the ""V"" that holds the amethyst isn't polished, it looks barely sanded. IT detracts from the face of the ring.2. the CZ are not even as close to sparkly as they are in the picture, even under florescent lighting.3. the band is so thin, that with everyday wearing, the band will break soon.For $24, it's ok. But if I had seen it in a store, I wouldn't have purchased this. (hence the 2 stars instead of 3.)"
5,Now you'll know what makes a greath journalist!,"Before, Daniel Schorr was simply a figure on my tv or a voice on my radio. Reading this book I have finally met Daniel Schorr. Now I know what makes a great journalist!"
5,Absolutely incredible -- an inspiration to all Americans!,"This book is simply fantastic. It contains numerous examples of why the right to free speech is necessary, and explores the eras in which this country has had to question the importance of such freedoms in regard to national affairs.This collection also acts as a tremendous biography of one of the greatest journalists of our time. By charting Schorr's career, each article simply goes straight to the point of showing how our country has evolved and continues to struggle with dominance of the government and the protection of individual liberties.This is a must read for everyone interested in journalism, communication, politics and the law. Thank you to the publishers for this generous contribution to academia."
4,Necessary for understanding the presidency,"Kernell's fine work is a wonderful addition to the scholarly literature in political science on the American presidency. It's well-written and well-organized. His insights into why, when and how presidents ""go public"" and take their case over the heads of congressmen to the people are informative and worthwhile. Not all of his observations fit the case studies he uses, and he sometimes exaggerates his case a bit, but overall he makes good points.Highly recommended for scholars of the presidency, or American politics in general. Also a good book for a knowledgeable layman interested in politics."
3,Okay,Not as nice in person as in the picture. The pink material is very cheap looking but my granddaughter does love it.
5,Best blade I've ever used.,"I had ordered several types of Irwin's jig saw blades for future projects being I needed U shank type now that I had a better saw. I recently used the 10 TPI blades for sawing ” thick laminated particleboard. Wow, it was like cutting thru butter. I hadn’t experienced anything like it for years. I’m looking forward to my next job hoping for the same results."
2,The Demise of a Dragon,"The story is fantasy, with some well known literary names: i.e. Merlin is the main character in this book. Sigrud is the Dragon Slayer. The problems they must overcome before meeting with the dragon are many. The handeling of each situation by the unlikely pair, make for an entertaining reading. The book is short in length, but long on morals and duties. The book is out of print. Amazon Books has found a scource for three hundred books at the home of the Author. Immediate shipment can be expected.."
3,Cute First Bike... But,"Don't plan to put this bike together the day before Christmas, especially if you're an apartment dweller or don't have a tool chest.You will have to run out and buy, as per the manufacturer's instruction: One Small Adjustable Wrench, One Large Adjustable Wrench, One Phillips Screwdriver (get one with a large tip) One Slip-Joint Pliers, One (Large) Metric Allen Wrench.Okay. Having done that, the assembly isn't too difficult to figure out, although a magnifying glass would come in handy to figure out the instructions. But if you had a bike when you were a kid, you can do it.Now - you've gotten it together, and it is cute. But WAIT, now you discover the tires are NOT inflated. That's right. They look fine, but give them a squeeze. So tomorrow it's off to buy a pump. Enjoy."
2,so sad,"After listening to juxtapose three times in a row, I'm afraid that try as hard as I might, I can't bring myself to like it. It is by far the worst tricky album to date; the production is cheesy and lacks class, and Martina or someother singer of substance is sorely missed. Tricky has gone lounge, and not in a good way. Two songs are good, one even sliding into a stereolab moment, but the rest of the album is abysmal. Previous tricky music has been sexy without trying, and this unfortunately tries without suceeding. Maybe tricky's problem is his lack of a strong woman these days; the album needs a bjork or a martina. This is the type of cd that you would listen to in the back of a convertible, coiffed hair bobbing side to side. I've been waiting for this cd for months, and yet I'm already listening to NearlyGod again just hours after running to the cd store.And in my opinion at least, I like the girls isn't funny. It is however, annoying and stupid."
4,Interesting Departure,"I have to say, this is not what I expected from Tricky, but it is a pleasant surprise. The rythym is substantially more discernable then previous albums (attributable to Muggerud, I would guess) but it maintains that subtle complexity that makes his stuff fun to listen to long past the initial scan. It's a step in a new direction for Tricky, but everyone must progress and evolve, and as long as he keeps going this way, I'll keep buying albums."
4,"Tricky's best since ""Maxinquaye""","I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about this one. I've been a huge Tricky fan for several years, but his last CD ""Angels With Dirty Faces"" was not an easy listen... I still found myself going back to his debut ""Maxinquaye"" disc to hear my most favorite, haunting Tricky tunes. As he progressed with each album, Tricky seemed to be drifting away from us, into his own paranoid realm. I'm glad to see he's altered his direction a bit. This album is very good - instantly likeable, filled with great hooks, heavy beats and samples, and it still retains the off-the-wall, darkness-looming, I'm-Tricky-and-I'm-really-stoned trademark. The only thing missing is the wonderful Miss Martina Topley-Bird's vocals. That's OK though, I'll just wait for her solo CD. :)"
3,not bad. not good either.,"i am a very serious fan of Tricky, and usually i don't complain about any cd but this one is extremely sold out. even DJ Muggs, one of the collaborators doesn't like this cd. This cd was supposed to be DJ Muggs and Tricky. Looks like it's back to Pre-Millenium Tension for me. Hopefully his next release will be much more satisfying."
3,Switching gears with inconsistent results.,"Tricky has reshaped his music again...manifesting into a twisted NYC version of Bristol trip-hop--stressing more on the hop than the trip. Juxtapose is courageous but not ambitious nor brilliant. Those accustomed to Marthine will be fantastically disappointed as she is not on this release. Instead, we have guest-producers and guest MCs who add dubious value. ""Contradictive"" shines as the albums best track, but tracks ""She Said"" and ""I Like the Girls"" are dumbfoundingly silly or stupid (particularly lyrically). Tricky appears to be reaching and clawing for meaningful lyrics--which started to show on Angels with Dirty Faces--how much more can he pine about his record deal? When compared to his earlier works, Juxtapose falls horribly flat and uninspired."
3,not the best tricky,"I'm a die hard super Tricky fan. I bought Fifth Element because of him. I bought A Little Romance because he wrote a song about it. This CD is ok. I mean, it's Tricky, it's better than most stuff, but he's gotten really bad guest stars. I want to know one thing... where is Martina on this CD??? They work so well together. This is something I play at work and I find it to be more... ""crowd pleasing"". If you weren't a Pre-Milennium Tension fan, don't listen to me, because I loved PMT. Juxtapose was... eh..."
2,"Could have been worse, possibly","At least we got one good song. And: I am fortunate enough to be buying overpriced Japanese releases which include, always, bonus tracks: in this case, as with Angels, the bonus tracks were as a whole better than the album. Not as overdone and histronic. Though in the case of Juxtapose you could also chalk it down to them lacking 'Mad Dog' Bionic, the weak weak English *rapper* ruining half this album by his very presence. I cant stand that kind of lawn-sprinkler ratchety delivery. Should of got Roots Manuva instead though if he had Tricky would have lost heavy in the lyrical content department. Seems like he just gets more lightweight every time. PS: I wish he didnt feel the need to perform Rage Against the Machine-style when he plays live. Saw him here in Tokyo and it was worth it for only one song, the Chll rob G cover off PMT. Pick up the baton or drop it completely T."
4,Nearly Great,"This is no where near as good as ""Maxinquaye"" or Nearly God, but it's leaps and bounds beyond Pre-Millenium and Angels with Dirty faces. It's good to hear some of his songs actually having structure again. ""Call Me,"" ""Contradictive"" and ""For Real"" prove he's still amazingly talented. And I can't believe how much ""Hot like a Sauna"" has grown on me. Oh yeah- anyone who's a tricky fan MUST pick up the ""For Real"" LP single with the song ""Bombing B*st*rds"" on it, it might be his best ever."
4,This album is very unique and an overall above average album,"I hadn't really listened to trick until Juxtapose came out and I'm glad to have discovered him. He is very original and I haven't heard anything like him before. I definitley recommened this album, even if you don't like it at first (I didn't like it at first), it definitley grows on you. I can't really get enough of this cd now."
3,Juxtapose is a surprising departure from usual Tricky,"This album is another example of tricky changing directions with each album he releases. What surprises me the most is the amount of very prominent guitar work. The guitar on ""For Real"" is extremely reminicient of Nirvana's 'Plateau' from their unplugged album. Some of the songs have junk lyrics, but not a bad job overall, once you listen to it a few times."
5,I LOVE THIS FOUNTAIN!!,I absolutely love this fountain! It is beautiful! They had the best price on this fountain by far. I had a little problem with the paint chipping off the fountain but they sent out a new one super fast.Definately people to do business with. Great product and will do business with again.
4,Randy Delivers.,"I have been a fan of Randolph Scott since i saw Ride the high country on TCM.Leonard Malton's TV movie book gave all these films high marks but were not on DVD until now.Ole Randolph has some good lines here as he confronts some fine actors from the day.Pernell Roberts,James Coburn(film debut)Richard Boone,Henry Silva and Lee Van Cleef.some good entertainment to be had here."
5,Just great!,For years I've been waiting for Boetticher's films on DVD. It was worth it. The Budd Boetticher Box Set is just great.
5,A Speedy Bargain,"This item from Amazon.com was at such a bargain price, it enabled me to place the order and avoid possible UK Customs & Excise charges of around $20.The delivery was so quick I thought that Concorde was back in service.Many thanks Amazon."
3,"Not Accurate, No Longer Use",I bought this thermometer for my 75 gallon tank. It does not give an accurate temperature reading. It is about 1.4 degrees off higher than the actual temp. It does not have a way to calculate it so I took it out of the aquarium and it is in a closet already. I do not recommend.
3,"Follow the 1st Cavalry Division, Airborne","Though a paltry twenty-one minutes long, this documentary has some nice 'in-country' shots from the early years in Vietnam. It is remeniscent of those old films one watched in high school years ago, with watered-down historical reference and just enough information to keep your interest. Inexplicably, at midpoint in the video, the narration stops for a few minutes and the viewer gets the feeling the director tried to pad the film with extra stock footage not even associated with helicopters or the 1st Cav. However, there are some nice shots of Hueys in action, a couple of Jolly Greens and even a Grasshopper is caught hauling off a wrecked fusilage. All-in-all, it's an interesting video to add to any Vietnam collection."
5,Proud of You,"I am as proud of you as if you were my own daughter. From the reading of this book I'd say that your father raised you to be gut-honest,straight-forward and relentlessly thorough in examining the aspects of your life that people seldom hold up to such scrutiny. Bravo, girl. Write on!"
1,I died of boredom,"I tried. I really tried since I hardly ever don't finish a book but this book bored me to death within 50 pages. It was wordy and dry as hell. While it may get better later on, I think a book should grab a reader within the first few pages. This one didn't even bother tap me on the shoulder to grab my attention. It's a shame, too, because I've read quite a few mysteries and was looking forward to a new writer"
1,The Kindle version is useless.,"This is not a comment on the printed version. The Kindle version is so poorly formatted it is basically useless. Subscripts and other crucial pieces of notation regularly overlap, have inexplicable spacing, or simply fail to appear at all readably. Get the print version instead."
3,Good & Bad!,"The meditations for peace and self discovery are good but to say that the information came from the Pleiadians is a lie! Sorry, but there are no Pleiadian. The Pleiadies is a place in space 400 light years from earth. There is no life on the Pleiadies. The planets are to young to have human (alien) life yet. Any writings that use the Plieadian name is a lie, scam, con! Any contact are are lie! And yes I do believe."
1,Bad Vibes,"I've been reading lots of books like this and I thought this would be a good one because it mentions the ""pleiadians"" and I have enjoyed Barbara Marciniak's books.Just a few pages into it and my being, my higher self, rebelled. I got bad vibes just reading- not necessarily doing- the meditations. This book is NOT for me. I have done much better with the meditations in ANGELIC REALITIES by Ashayana Deane.I would proceed with caution. The book I have is brand new & I'm looking to get rid of it! My suggestion is to go to a book store & feel it for yourself before making a decision."
1,Complete baloonies !,Anyone who is truly in the search of the miraculous should thus book a miss. It is another one big stories in the mind. It will not get you closer to truth one iota. Each to their own and I would rather read Ramana Maharshi and Nisargadatta Mahaaj than any if this pseudo spiritual knowledge. In fact I should as for a refund !
2,I tried...sort of,"I couldn't get into it. I enjoyed reading Marciniak's book about empowerment and I like the Pleiadians, even if it turns out just to be a thought form, but this was a little too far-fetched to me. Roses, all these ""techniques"" the author claims to have channeled just sounded ridiculous. All the power to you if you want to practice this stuff and it helps you in some way, but I think this author in particular has just jumnped on the Pleiadian bandwagon and is selling rubbish. I believe the Pleiadians might exist, but this author sounds full of it to me. I can not put my faith in her."
1,BAD EXPERIENCE WITH MEDITATIONS AFTER 1 YEAR APPROXIMATELY,"I just wanted to share that I am having a bad experience with the meditations in this book. I am feeling a lot of invasive energy and have more confusing thoughts now then before I purchased the book.While I do believe in the modern mystical experience and spiritual experience, I do not believe this is a safe method for developing those experiences.I highly recommend against it. Peace."
1,Divine ka-ka,"If the world actually evolved according to the Pleiadian prophesies and 'wisdom', how incredibly tepid, boring and one-dimensional life would be. You will never have light without dark, happiness without suffering, birth without death, growth without decay. These are the raw facts and it's science fiction like this that leads people to focus on forces outside their own consciousnesses to find happiness."
3,Time and Circumstance,"Simply beautiful music from a truly gifted pianist. Reflecting Mirrors and the title track are my stand-outs, but the whole disc is just wonderful. At times it makes you wanna cut a rug and then it turns to something mellow and dreamy. That bass and drum just don't quit."
3,"Hate it, Love it","This album was hard for me to rate. I really don't care for ska that much, but I liked some of the old Dingees material. The thing about the Dingees is that they combine several styles in their cds. Some of the songs on here aren't ska at all, and those are the ones I really love! But the others just get on my nerves. Although I don't like to skank and I don't like ska, Dingees are top notch on the ska list. Compared to Goldfinger, Bosstones or whatever they are just as good. So if you like ska, punk, or reggae you may want to check this out. It you like all of the fore mentioned you'll definately want to check this out."
4,Dingees RAWWK!!!,"This last Dingees album represents very well what they are made of, every tune represents some unique and fresh,also very well on the albums final mix, its got the balance beetween the punk, ska and reggae The Dingees are distinguished by"
5,This book seriously rocks!,"Maybe ""Dracula Fan"" needed some more blood in his bloody mary-something to nourish his rather small brain. Okay, I'm sorry to get personal, but his (or her) review just doesn't track.This book seriously rocks! I've made most of the drinks in it over the past year . . . they're not only super EASY, but FUN and DELICIOUS! And as for the ""no pictures"" remark, well most of us haven't needed pictures to understand things since grade school-the recipes here are crystal clear. Besides, smart people know that photos pump up the price, and this book has 150 recipes for a very reasonable $10.36 (Amazon price). Yes, this book is small (5 x 7 inches), but it's packed not only with great recipes, but with loads of other information-from definitions of liqueurs and liquors, to measurement equivalents, to garnish ideas, and so on.Too bad a dead-head review can knock down the rating of such a good book. I'm giving it 5 stars and it deserves it!"
1,Awful Book!,"If you like small print, and NO pictures at all, then by all means buy this very small book. I'm returning my copy for a refund."
3,Informative!,"Daniel Boone is a bloodhound. But he is much more! He is a search-and-rescue dog. In One Incredible Dog! Boone, the reader experiences a day in the life of Boone. From a classroom where the children discuss Boone's job to the hunt for and successful recovery of a missing child, a lost grandfather and the apprehension of a thief, we follow Boone and learn so much about the importance of a search-and-rescue animals.The black and white illustrations by Judith Friedman are appealing. This book is part of a new Early Reader Series that honors dogs that do incredible things for people. It is geared for children ages 4-8 and is a remarkable book that will not only educate but entertain. I know my grandchildren will enjoy this book. I certainly did.One Incredible Dog! Boone is a grand read for those special children in your life."
4,Cram time? I think these might be of assistance...,"I'm a senior in high school...so procrastination is my middle name. These flash cards not only help with preparing for the AP test at the end of the year, but also with exams throughout the course. I love how concise they are. The only thing I would like to see is more illustrations when it comes to cycles and systems."
2,Not recommended,"Although the flashcards say that they're best used with Barron's book How to Prepare for AP Biology, I found that they are largely unhelpful even in tandem with the book. (Those hoping to use solely the flashcards would be even more disappointed.) Instead, I would rely on a good review book. The ""flashcards"" themselves are more like notecards with bulleted information on the back; however, they are oddly organized and are sometimes difficult to understand because of their brevity. Within the nineteen categories, the cards are arranged in a strange order - for example, the ""blood"" flashcard comes after the flashcards with the components (plasma, RBCs, WBCs) and some cards seem repetitive (there is one called ""pathway of blood"" that is nearly identical to ""human heart"", save for a diagram on one). If I had to study again, I would simply purchase the Barron's AP Biology book alone, and not waste money on these."
3,one of his lesser efforts,"I've read two (Making the World and Small Things Considered) of Petroski's other books and loved them both. This I snagged mainly because of the cover wanting to read about the Guggenhiem Museum in Bilbao. Sadly, too much of this book is basically on bridges.Nothing wrong with that but they are not my thing when it comes to engineering. The other half of the book covers such fascinating areas as the aforementioned in Bilbao, the Dorton Arena (little known but very early precussor to the domed stadiums of the '70s and '80s) and the Three Gorges Dam in China.The only bridge story that really grabbed me was the ancient Britannia Bridge because of the construction methods used that are not in vogue today (mainly brick). I'm willing to give the half of the book that revolves around bridges a second read but you really do have to be into bridges in a big way to want this book. My advice--borrow it from a library first, if you're not a bridge afficiando."
2,spend the extra bucks........,"While this is an alright deal on a saw it is not the UNISAW version, but the Canadian version and parts are not interchangeable. Also be careful of the mobile base u buy as the 1 the claim for it doesnt fit, had to return 1 and order different version. Bottom line either buy the Unisaw model or a Jet JTAS model, u will be happier........."
3,Great novela but...,The novela is a classic. One of our family's favorite. The problem is that the encoding used to fit the 9 hour's worth of programming killed the resolution and audio (especially the music score). It is a disappointment that such a great novela has to be reduced to such poor quality. Even worse is the official reproduction. They should have done a boxed set instead.
5,"kate del castillo at her finest, this is her best!","this soap opera has everything -love,hate,deception,and great scenery and location. kate del castillo and guy ecker are fabulous together. and kate's father as her uncle is great too. the story is great as one cousin basically gets away with murder and kate's character is confused to be the one who did it, so guy ecker's character decides to get revenge, being as it is his brother was the one who died, by the cousin's lies and deceit.soon he finds himself in love with the supposed person who made his brother die, and he constantly tries to make himself hate kate's character, and the story is left with figuring everything out towards the end with lots of action as well. a must for the latin soap collector."
3,Good Soap,"Though there were important scenes left out, its a good movie to watch. For those who want to enjoy a romantic soap over and over."
1,Think Twice before buying,"I have notice that when buying other shows that are not spanish speaking, they are complete from beginning to end. But when buying this show ""La Mentira"", was totally disappointing that most of the show was missing. It makes me wonder about future purchases. Is this just for spanish speaking shows? Please do not offer, if you can not produce a complete show."
5,Excellent,I love this Kate Del Castillo is awesome in this she does a great job I don't like old soap operas but this one I don't even see as a soap opera
3,La Mentira,"It was ok. I wish the original song would have been kept. That was one of the main reasons I liked this telenovela when it aired on tv. Alot of the scenes where cut. In the end, I don't regret buying it."
5,La Mentira (Resumen de la telenovela),"Excelente resumen, trae una sinopsis muy bien escogida de los detalles mas relevantes de la telenovela, manteniendo el hilo de la trama. La entrega fue rapida y puntual. Disfrutenla, vale la pena!"
4,Great Story.,"I love the characters in this soap opera but it seemed that beyond editing the boring,filling material there were a few too many critical scenes eliminated. If you hadn't seen it on TV, you would have missed imp. details. There were some scenes I was looking forward to from the TV series & they were absent. I'm still happy I purchased this but I was disappointed. I do realize it's difficult to condense such a long story."
2,Not Complete episodes. condense very dissapointed,"I was so dissapointed to see that it was not complete episodes of the novela. It's very cut and if you never watch it you won't know, what you miss, but I know that they cut all the good story. I wish I could get my money back but I'm stuck with this."
4,Perfectly adequate citrus fruit,"I ordered this for making homemade limoncello (and lime-cello), which only uses the zest, so the actual juice is all sitting in my freezer and I can't really comment on its flavor. The Meyer lemons were large and beautiful, definitely of a quality that I would never find in a grocery store. The limes were big and pretty but there were only 6 of them, not 12. I guess it works out because of their large size, but it was still a little annoying. The Lisbon lemons were cosmetically nice but nothing to write home about. I would definitely order Meyer lemons from this company again, but maybe wouldn't bother with the other stuff. However, I will say that this box would make a neat, unique gift if you know someone who really, really, really likes lemons."
5,For those who want to understand what it is to be human,"Edward Farley has written a superb book on what it is to be human. While drawing on the riches of the Christian theological tradition, he remedies some of the tradition's deficiencies--especially with regard to the tragic aspect of life. Farley is particulary insightful with regard to how human beings are made in the image of God and yet are temptable and fallible. Farley is to theology as Tolstoy is to fiction: both manage somehow to be unblinking observers of human wrong who yet see and report not with malice but compassion."
1,"Small knife great, big knife mediocre.","The large knife came dull and doesn't want to hold an edge. I tossed it... somewhere and haven't looked at it for a while.The small one isn't bad, but it also came quite dull.$40 (current price) is way too much to spend on the set. The only redeeming feature is that it goes on sale for much less sometimes."
4,A Decent Knife,"Though definitely not lacking in style, this knife is just a little bit lacking in design. The frame-lock (practically liner-lock) design is still a bit un-secure for my liking. I recommend that, if you do get this knife, open the blade and press the ""locking"" part of the frame down firmly, and leave the blade open for a while so that the metal has a better tendency to spring into that position. It'll make it a bit safer to use. The blade steel is not junk, but it is also nothing extremely special - probably 420 but it is hardened a bit better than other 420. Four stars because of locking system. All in all, it's not a bad knife. I do love Gerber Gear."
4,Great knives for the price,"Large knife is not quite as sharp as the small one, but it is the right size and weight. Small one is perfect for every day small use and hold edge nicely. The large one does need a good sharpening every now and again but the serrated always seems to stay razor sharp. definitely recommend these if this is your price range."
4,Mini Paraframe is perfect,I have used the mini daily as it is light and easily accessable from my pocket. It keeps a nice edge and is very easy to open and close.The only reason for a 4 instead of a 5 is the larger paraframe has not been useful as of yet. I have not needed it due to the mini and have not really been in the field due to weather.
1,2 crappy knives for the price of one!,Blades come without even a decent edge and then refuse to take an edge. Machining (?!?) of the Mini is so poor that engaging of the locking function is darn near impossible. Buy these knives only for someone you expect to get into a knife fight with in the future. You safety and success are certain.
2,"Neat looking, but don't hold up well","I have the larger of the two knives, which I bought to use as an everyday type tool to have in the pocket, smaller than my Buck 110, and larger than a penknife. The knife worked well for a while, then the screws started to fall out of the handle. If I had been able to find the little buggers, a little loc tite would have fixed the issue...but who knows where they went...It was a disappointment to see something like this happen on what I believed to be a quality product. I have replaced this knife with one of the folding box cutter types. Nicer on the hand for me, and it hasn't fallen apart yet."
3,OK for b sides,"The title track, ""Nonstop to Tokyo"" didn't quite catch my fancy, nor did the radio edit which is basically a shortened version. A bit too repetitive and not much melody.So that leaves the B-sides: Room service - easy to listen to in the loungy style Bossanova 3003 - Snippets of previous releases are mixed here, but not sustained enough and it's all over the place... Mademoiselle - Upbeat and funky.All in all, if you're a collector it may have some value, but for others I'd suggest getting their US released (and much cheaper) albums first. As a side note, the special packaging is rather annoying to use and I accidentally ripped mine, at least the packaging for the combination spaciale EP was more sturdy."
5,Animals and A Cracking Good Storyline--What More Could You Want?,"I am not going to give away any spoilers, but this series is just swell. It's way better than a soap opera, but it has situations in it that would fit in a soap opera--in other words, never a dull moment! This family that runs this veterinary practice is full of rich characters and the writing is quite good. Watch two episodes and you'll be hooked, and it's likely you'll ""waste"" the day watching the rest of the episodes back to back.I'm waiting anxiously for the next season!"
1,Not so great,The peels get stuck. I'm going to buy a good old-fashioned peeler - they work the best.
5,Awesome peeler,"Awesome peeler - really works. I've never peeled kiwis so easily. Also peels tomatoes very easily. I don't use it on potatoes since simpler ones work and I want to keep it sharp, but I'm sure it would do a great job.Removes a little more skin then a flat peeler (another reason I don't use it on potatoes), but it can peel things regular peelers can't."
5,Best peeler I've used.,"I saw this peeler recommended about 5 years ago, and got one. After much use and abuse, it ended up breaking when it got stuck in the dishwasher. Up till that point, it was still working as well as the day I bought it. I purchased another different one, and really missed my old one. So I bought another one that looked just like it...looks were deceiving, it wasn't the same. I finally stopped wasting my time and money, and bought this one again. Finally, I found what I was looking for. A great peeler, that requires minimum pressure to get an effective peel. I expect this one to last for a long time too!"
1,plastic parts broke with first use,"I had to return this product. It was horrible.I was using a Neverkink hose with it, and this plastic contraption broke as soon as I turned the water on. The side parts blew off.Poor quality."
1,not very champa,used it and it is not worth the money! chandrika is 1/4 the price and it smells way more than this. will not be purchasing it again...disappointed
2,Use Caution...,Not sure what happened. I received the smaller 75gram bar instead of the 150gram. Not sure if it was a human error or if it was mislabled (it has an added barcode sticker added). The product discription is hard to read and I only caught the error because I also ordered an additional box of 4 150gram bars so I was able to compare. I contacted Amazon and they refunded me the cost rapidly.The product it's self is outstanding. I love the smell and the soap leaves my skin clean and doesn't dry it out. I love it and will order more when the time comes.
4,authentic surf sounds from the 60's,"the two Richie Allen albums are finally available on CD! Recorded in '62 and '63, they are the real thing, authentic surf sounds from SoCal. The band includes such L.A. studio luminaries such as Plas Johnson on sax, Sandy Nelson on drunms, and Tommy Tedesco on guitar, as well as Richie Allen (Podolar). This is the real thing, folks, get this one as well as The Rising Surf!"
3,"Not bad, but not particularly good, either.","Pretty standard Star Trek fare; not as much action as we sometimes see, but a bit of moderately good drama, some alternate dimensions, Spock and Scotty's technical know-how is what separates the Enterprise from all the rest, a crackpot villain with good intentions who's sadly misguided, some annoying civilian politicos, and some Klingon bluster. Most of the usual elements of a Star Trek story, mixed together in a slightly new set of proportions. Nothing really exciting."
5,"Slow Start, But Excellent Plot: A Winner!!!","To date I have read many Star Trek books-both from the origanal and T.N.G.-and I believe ""The Starship Trap"" by Mel Guilden is one of the best! It combines some new well-developed charactures, a good share of action and a intriguing plot. From begining to end I enjoyed this book and would read it again anytime. Another winner from the world of ""Star Trek""!"
4,It's a trap!,"Good character developement, good story. The villian is your typical mastermind--with a little twist. The novel is a good read, with a great little alternate dimension spurt added in the later half of the book. It flows very well and will be a good choice for anyone into classic Star Trek drama without much ""action""."
3,Hijacking starships in hyperspace.,"A TOS novel, this story is typical of the later TOS when smaller and smaller plotlines are drawn out and explored. Some sence of a pirate under current."
5,here we go............,"I got this for that song (which is one of the best rnb songs ever), and honey dip, which is a dope song. the rest is more ballads and slow songs, which they do really well."
5,the cd,The album is a classic all the slow songs were nice!!!! About to buy again reminds me of prom and freshman year in college a must buy if ur old school u will enjoy.
4,Do You Have One of Those Groups?,"Once of those groups who have been playing for years, and they know every single monster and all their stats from all the Monster Manual books? Are you a DM who is sick of every time you start to describe a Cockatrice they already know what you are talking about before your sentence is finished? If so, you are like me, and this book plus the others from Sword & Sorcerery did the trick. Finally some monsters no one had heard of! This book has a great selection of all kinds of things, perfect for any campaign. My only complaint is that its not in color."
4,Nice CD,"This is a really nice cd. If you like Diamond, you'll like this. Has a few religious quickies in there, but it is the soundtrack from the movie. Good listening. CD was brand new."
3,Jazz Singer CD,This was not a new CD to me - I love the music. 3 of the songs were distorted and could not be heard correctly - I was not happy with this CD.
4,Still great after all these years,"Some of Neil's best-- Hello Again, America, Love on the Rocks and Songs of Life-- vintage classics!"
5,flashback,"I recently had the chance to watch this movie again and remebered how much I loved the music from it. Actually I am a long time fan of Neil Diamond,and just had to have this music. Pure nostalgia. What can I say. It just brings back fond memories of a time that was the best for me."
4,My favorite movie album!!!,"I love this album!!! The movie was okay, but the music is sensational!!! My favorite song is ""Love on the Rocks""."
1,"""America"" is one of the most spectacularly horrible songs!","""America"" is quite the phenomenom. It collects so many of the hallmarks of a horrible song into such a concise package. We have a wonderfully insincere patriotic message, a marvelously cheesy pseudo-heavy guitar part, a woefully synthesized orchestra, a flat spoken word section, and a terrifically horrendous choir of everyday people containing some sort of message about democracy, I think. Few songs reach a peak of sheer banality this high. After this monumental opener there's not too many other places the album can go. There's no way it could possibly get worse, but that doesn't mean that it gets that much better. All in all, a spectacular achievement in the annals of horrible music!"
4,Comparable to the likes of Jolson,"Having seen the original Jolson version, then Diamond's you must learn to appreciate both. If you choose, you can look at them from the aspect of different time periods. Diamond's is a much more modernized portrayal of The Jazz Singer, especially with the music, hehe. The story is different to a sense, and it involves the likes of a rock star over Jolson's Broadway character. We must also remember that ""The Jazz Singer"" was the first film of all-time... being silent, per se it would be incomparable to this. If you have seen the Diamond film this album might be heavily valuable to you... if you haven't then it is only good music."
4,Great CD! A triumph...,"This cd is excellent from track one all the way through. By comparing its sound quality to other Neil discs, I'm assuming it has been remastered. (although the cd doesn't specify this) My only complaint is that there is a great deal of ""hiss"" heard in many of the tracks. Other than that, this is a very enjoyable album. Who could possibly dislike ""Hello Again?"""
3,honest seller,"this person who sold this CD to me is an honest person. The CD arrived cracked and played only some songs. I replyed through the receipt and this person returned payment to my account. Although, it was only $5.98, but the seller returned every cent. Thank you, we need more people like this seller in the world. dennis in hawaii"
2,The way not to publish a book,I'm hopeless at organization; and was desparate to do something to get better at it.Having laboured through most of the book it appears that only the writer and publisher were impressed and knew what was being discussed. It is a visual rubbish heap. There is the impression of wanting to save the planet; rather than staying with a number of points and principles that will enable simpletons like me to understand it.The deluge of information for the likes of me is mind-deadening. Poorly presented and a total lack of consideration for the intended audience. The author is so busy getting organized she forgot to organize the direction of the book. She might be super impressed with it; but I'm not!
1,Never buy from Amazon,"I will never buy anything from Amazon again. I placed an order on Dec. 5th and the item was in stock. When the item did not arrive as of 12-18 I called to see what the problem was. They told me it would not arrive until after Christmas. Unacceptable! I asked that they ship the two items I ordered 2-day at no extra cost to me, they said they could only get one item to me now and the other after Christmas. I said okay, but at no extra cost to me, they again said no. I canceled my whole order! They are horrible at customer service! If you order this item, I am told on the phone (not on the web) that it will take 1 - 3 weeks! Don't buy from these people!"
5,"Educational & lots of fun~teacher, mom, & kid approved!","My boys love the Laurie Keller Scrambled States books, and we first learned about the game from an educational game night at their school. As a teacher, I love that this game is educational AND fun--it is a great way to get kids familiar with the states, capitals, and nicknames as well as locating them on a map. Our whole family enjoys to play."
5,Awesome game,My 6-year-old and 4-year-old play this game everyday! It's so educational and fun to play too! We also love the book and the dvd.
5,A must have!,I bought this game for my daughter three years ago when she was in first grade. This is the BEST game for learning where all the states are and also for memorizing capitals. Now in fourth grade there are map tests and she zips right through them. The game is also fun and it is one of my favorites to play with her.The Scrambled States book is also a must have. The little side comments are the funniest things you will read in any kid's book.
5,Lots of fun,My boys love playing with maps.I am very glad I decided to buy this game.It's lots of fun and now it's our favorite game.It's a good size for traveling.What I like about this game that it forces kids to take turns reading the cards which is great for early readers.I am very happy with this purchase
4,Fun game for teaching,This was a fun and informative to get the kids to learn and study the states. I would buy again and recommend.
3,disappointed,"This product is educational however, the format is very competitive and the first person to respond wins that round. I felt some of the questions could have been individually answered instead of always depended on fast response. My grandson is seven and love facts about the states. The format makes success dependent on responding first and being no penalty for a wrong answer, the faster individuals throw out answers and confuse the issue."
5,Educational,A wonderful way for a child to learn the states and capitals and know where there are on our map
5,Excellent Game for 8 and 9 year old daughters,"We currently live overseas and our daughters go to an International School. We were concern that they would not learn about the States and purchased this game for Christmas. Besides the game being educational, it's fun to play. The girls have played the game over and over plus they are already learning the locations of the States. Game is also easy to take on trips, another plus for our family. Highly recommend this game."
4,Fun game,"Bought this game for a 7 yr old, she thinks its fun. You definately have to know how to read and understand what 'vowels' are. The object is to be the quickest to set your card down so to play the game accurately, the child has to understand the questions.Our game did not come with instructions so I had to look them up online, also the colors on the game cards do not match the reference map they give you (red is pink and the brown is different)overall, fun game though and it makes the child learn about the States."
4,More fun than expected...,"We got this game for our daughter (she's 8) because she loves the book. I have to admit, my husband and I had as much fun with this game as our daughter did. It's fun and fast-paced, as well as educational."
3,This isn't as fun as I thought,"I thought this would teach my 7 y/o the states and state capitals but the actual game has nothing to do with learning them. I don't know what I expected but this wasn't it. If you are looking for a fun game, this isn't it. He enjoys it but I don't think it's very good."
5,Very educational and entertaining game,"Following reading the book on which this game is based on, I decided to purchase for my daughter both the book and the game. Even though the game states it's intended for ages 8 and older, my daughter who is 6 (but can already read fluently) enjoys it immensely. My younger daughter who is 4 joins in as we'll and can do some of the activities by herself, such as recognizing the first letter of a state and so on, but most of all, my husband and I also enjoy the game and we really love seeing how quickly our daughters can locate a certain state on the map. Truly an amazing game."
2,Not as expected,"Not satisfied with purchase. But the sender is not at fault. It is not what I was looking for. A little pricey too, I thought."
5,Nostalgic Moments,"I love compilation CDs that include hits from a certain year. These songs are often never heard from again. Solution? 1996 Grammy Nominees! This excellent CD includes huge hits (One of Us, Kiss From a Rose, Waterfalls) that we became sick of. Now, 4 years later, we wonder where they went. This is a great CD to be listened to at any time. It is very upbeat and includes the first hits from Shania Twain (who now has about 60493 hits), Hootie & the Blowfish, Alanis Morissette, and the divine Joan Osborne. This disc is recommended for its wide spectrum of styles and variety. You will love this!"
5,Memories Come to Life,"my step sister would always come over to my house and play this CD non stop. i grew up on this CD, literally. I developed my ear for hip hop, my first true love. i remember rapping to Left Eye's rap from Waterfall in my living room. i still know every lyric to this CD even today. ""Kiss from a Rose"" by Seal and ""One Sweet Day"" by Boyz II Men feat. Mariah Carey are my favorite romantic songs ever. And ""One of Us"" literally changed my life. It made me think philosophically at such a young age. i was such a hip hop baby. I remember rapping in the car to ""Gangsta's Paradise"" over and over again until my mom yelled at me. This CD is magical in my opinion. its the ultimate CD for any collection and i advise everyone to have it."
4,Classic Updike,"OF THE FARM is not for the feint-hearted, nor for those looking for sympathetic characters. It is grueling, a word by word march on strained relationships and bad decisions. But, that's also what makes it worthwhile, Updike prying into the human condition. Joey is undoubtedly Updike himself, leaving Olinger, marrying poorly, and living by the ocean in order to breathe. The mother is selfishness personified. The new wife lacks compassion. The only redeeming character is the young stepson, too young to know exactly what is going on around him. Still, intense Updike is great Updike, even if it brings a twinge of pain to turn to the next page."
4,Updike or Not,"I am not a huge Updike reader. Of the Farm is rich in description of character & scenery but not much of story. So is it worth a read? You bet it is. He reveals more about emotions & how to handle them than any shrink is willing to do. After all the purpose of a book is to read it at least once, not come back repeatedly for hundreds a dollars an hour getting nothing done except getting the shrink's car paid for & detailed. I enjoyed the book. Actually the farm is the main character."
3,REVIEW,"Not bad for my first Updike novel. The mother teetering on the edge of insanity kept my attention. I like the simplistic writing of Updike. For the most part, I read history books and was looking for something recreational, which it was."
4,Great jokes.,Simple story. Quick read. Great old jokes though. The entire story with Neal and his girlfriend is a nice way to wrap things up also.
3,"Light hearted, uneven, but worthwhile for beach, bus, or bedtime.","Lighthearted, and a little uneven, but worthwhile for beach, bus, or bedtime. And if you love borscht belt humor there is plenty of that to grin and groan over."
3,Not My Favorite,"I really like the first few 'Neal Carey' novels by Don Winslow (whom I love and buy anything he writes). This one was funny and fast paced, but left me wondering what it was all about. Normally Neal Carey gets involved in strange, but weirdly compelling, situations and prevails in the end. But this one seemed almost trivial and I never did see why Neal's employers were involved. Lots and lots of funny one-liners, but in the end mostly pointless.This is not to say I won't read more Neal Carey novels if Winslow write them, just that I can't in all conscience recommend this one very much."
3,a lot of changes,"Unfortunatelly i rate this cd with three stars because i think that is the weakest one of this band. Soft -pop- sound compared with the good -FLNL line- and imaginative songs of the last two works. If you like For Love Not Lisa, you are going to enjoy with ""Sugarless"" and ""Closer Than You Think""; but maybe the band's member changes are no so good. Michael Lewis (guitar and voice from FLNL) and Geoff Riley (drum), i think, they are not enough.Where are the others? And i don't understand why, Miles (FLNL guitar), are not in the band as in the second album and why Clint Mcbay (FLNL bass), only play in live with them.Anyway; you can enjoy with Lewis voice; but this work miss the magic touch of the other two. Maybe, they miss a full band."
4,Great selection,"I love this trilogy and wish they would re-make it in this decade. It's a great learning tool and great documentary.I remember they aired it twice once in October of 2004 and then October of about 2006 on PBS. I tried taping it and it didn't pan out. After trying to find a good priced dvd set, I finally found one. Grab it up before it's out of print!!"
4,Excellent,I enjoyed the film and I also use it as a teaching tool in my Women and Religion class. They are fascinated with Wicca and pagan religions.
1,Don't waste your money!,Ultimately you get what you pay for. In this case you get even less. The one I got made a lot of bubbles which my fish enjoyed swimming through. That's the only positive I have for it.It's made of cheap materials. It didn't hold together well. It was a pain to adjust. Not that adjusting it made a difference. The assembly instructions were horrendous.In short: Don't buy!
1,DO NOT BUY,"Cheap, does not work and expels tons of micro-bubbles into the tank. never skimmed an once of anything all the bubbles went out into the tank not up to skim!!"
2,Runs BIG,"My son received this as a gift for his 4th birthday in the Child size Small which is meant for boys ages 4-6. He is tall for his age, but this costume is huge on him. It is too long and there is no way to realistically make it smaller for his size. Also the belt falls off of him because it's so big and there's no way to make it tighter.He is so disappointed because he wanted to wear it for Halloween this year, but it bunches up at the knees. I'm disappointed by their sizing standards and wish that I could figure out a creative solution for him."
4,cute,"My son loves this costume, he still plays with it after holloween, I would recommend this site to anyone."
3,poorly made costume,"This was a very bad costume because it ripped! I was having a great day until then. I was the first one to see the clone wars.When the clone wars was done,I was happy.But when it ripped,it took the happienes out of me."
2,Clone Trooper costume,I purchased a clone trooper costume for my grandson...It came as discribed and was in wonderful condition. It was a brand new costume and was the costume he wanted. As for me.. I feel it was very cheaply made and not worth the high price I paid...but then again. I'm an old woman and what do I know about costumes...except that i've made several of my own for many years and was very dissapointed in the cheap quality of the product. And he will have a terrible time being able to see through the slit they have on the mask of the costume...Which he'll probably end up having to take off to see and then he won't look like a clone trooper. But a kid in a one piece pajama outfit.....but welcome to 2008...As long as he was happy and doesn't know the difference...so be it....
5,Clone Trooper,This costume fit well . My son is six years old and very slender so the fit was no problem. The mask did not fit so well and it was hard for him to see out of.
1,very disappointing,"We sent this back the day after receiving it. Cheaply made, yes, but we expected that. We were disappointed mainly in the fit, which was not even close. Size runs much smaller than stated. Helmet is poorly done. It is more like a mask which was uncomfortable and didn't fit properly either. My boy couldn't see out of it. Amazon was excellent about taking the costume back. You can get this at Target too. Go check it out and see for yourself. This isn't worth half the money they're charging. Wish we could find good star wars costumes that didn't cost a ton. That would make a lot of little boys happy."
5,Absolutely perfect costume for Star Wars Fan!,"Thank you my son was begging to be a trooper for Halloween. Thanks for the low price on this costume, we made a little boy very happy."
3,"Pretty good costume, just one complaint","The costume itself is good. The mask is terrible. There is no area molded for the nose. The mask is completely flat in the nose area, so when wearing it, it presses and squishes your nose. My son doesn't seem to mind it, but his nose is all red when he's done wearing the mask. Not to mention, it's not easy to see out of, which I knew would be an issue when buying it."
3,costume was dirty,Very good costume but it was dirty. I was reading about a princess costume from the same provider (Rubies costume) and they had the same problem!
2,Too tranparent,"Too short and too trasparent, does not cause the desired effect, it will be better to invest in a more expansive model."
2,Much larger that stated,"HUGE! Like the other reviewers said, the mask is flat on the inside and pushes on their nose, so my son didn't wear the mask much."
4,my son likes it,"My son was almost 8 and he's tall. With the M size he could fit in a sweater underneath, since we had delayed trick-or-treat this year thanks to Hurricane Sandy."
3,good,The costume was good for halloween but the helmet strap came undone and the outfit didnt hold up much past halloween without a tear
3,Ok for price,My main issue is with the very thin and weak Velcro on the mask. My son could not keep it on because the elastic was so weak and it only has a tiny bit of Velcro to hang on too. There is no adjust for the mask because of this. Overall it is what you pay for and he still had a blast on Halloween.
3,short stories,"It's a quick read but the stories are short and I like to follow the characters and not get it quick (character, story, plot, the end). The story lines were good but they should had been more developed."
1,Junk. Broke in the first week.,"The poor quality die-cast metal collar for adjusting the height of the top pole broke where the cheap, plastic tightening knob is. This is a huge piece of [...] and I would not recommend it. I am sending it back."
2,Cheap Construction,I am only half way through this book and pages are falling out. The bunding is bad. Cheap romance novels have better binding. I need to read this as part of my Theology course but it won't last long enough to go into my library.
5,ACAPPELLA-CD,CD WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION! IT ARRIVED PROMPTLY AND CONFIRMATIONS WERE SENT OUT PROMPTLY! THANK YOU FOR SUCH WONDERFUL SERVICE. IT MAKES BUYING ON-LINE THAT MUCH EASIER!
5,Absolutely beautiful harmony!,"I've always loved the sound of Acapella and they have some really beautiful songs on this CD! All of the songs have a wonderful message to them. My favorites are ""I'm at Your Mercy"" and ""If There Were no God""."
3,"Is not 1"" square","I purchased the medium block punch, thinking I would have a 1"" x 1"" square.After receiving the punch, however, I find it is smaller. On the back of the package it says it is ""1 cm/.625 inches"" . First, I don't think 1 cm equals .625 inches. Second, there is nothing in the descriptions (here or elsewhere that I could find) saying it is 1"" across DIAGONALLY. So if anyone is needing a 1"" x 1"" square, this is not it.Otherwise, the quality of these punches are fair. Not excellent, but they are handy and easy to use."
2,Not as described,"I ordered this product for a school project, it was supposed to be a one-inch square. What I received was an irregular measurement of 11/16 of an inch. The punch itself works well but the project was made exponentially more difficult due to this error in description. I would be wary of purchasing from this seller again."
3,"Works well, but not 1""","The 1"" square punch actually creates a square that fits inside a 1.5"" diameter circle. This means the square is more like 1.06066017 inches. (Diameter of the circle is 1.5 inches. If you put a square in the circle, the diagonal line across the square is 1.5"", creating a triangle with a 1.5"" hypotenuse and unknown size of each side. A squared plus B squared = C squared. if A=B, you get 2A^2=1.5^2. It's easy to solve from there...)It doesn't matter a lot, except if you are creating squares that you want to fit into a larger project - like cover a certain size surface. As you put square next to square, the difference adds up surprisingly quickly!"
2,"Its not the book, its the editor","The Chopin Etudes are some of the most difficult and interesting pieces to master, and I find then fascinating. However, Carl Mikuli creates an obstacle in this book. Mikuli, being one of Chopin's dear students, thought that because he was a student of Chopin he knew Chopin enough to change his music. While editing Chopin's works, he would change notes, fingerings, and other important articulation tools to the liking he believed was Chopin's. When comparing Chopin's original transcripts to those that Mikuli edited, there are huge differences that make the music quite different to what Chopin had hoped. I personally recommend Chopin's works edited by Paderevsky (or Paderewsky), for he kept every single aspect of the music Chopin wrote, even specific dynamic marks. The Paderevsky editions give a clear understanding of what Chopin wanted for his pieces."
3,You're sure to get a smile,"This album from 1957 features Tina Louise singing pop standards. Tina has a decent voice, but her singing is really nothing special. The songs have tasteful arrangements, but they aren't too exciting. In short, this is an average ""album by a starlet"" of the era. It will mostly be of interest to fans ofGilligan's Island."
3,lush and lovely,"Although she has limited range, Tina Louise's appeal is mighty--especially among baby boomers and nostalgia buffs. Her renditions of smoky lounge favorites like ""Embraceable You"" and ""Let's Do It"" are very friendly and sexy, just like Ginger Grant herself. Fans take note: Tina also did a single for United Artists not available here: ""In The Evening"" (with ""I'll Be Yours"" on the flip). It's worth finding."
5,the only cd i'd take to a desert isle,"in my opinion it's always time for tina. this cd is a must for any tina louise fan, but not just for nastalgia but becauseit's a darn good listen. miss louise has talents the hollywood casting agents never dreamed of. you've got to admire someone like her who just keeps plugging at it and turning out great performances, one after the other.this cd is no exception.it comes from early in her career but shows the talent of a seasoned pro.tina louise is a master at reinventing herself,that,long before anyone ever heard of madonna."
4,excellent,"I admit I have solidly been in the ""Ginger"" camp when it comes down to the ""Ginger or Mary Ann?"" question. Tina Louise's 1957 album clinches the deal. Her collection of torch songs is well done and her takes on ""Embraceable You"" and ""Let's Do It"" are outstanding. ""It Had to Be You"" was the only song that she later did on ""Gilligan's Island"".Tina Louise had a career which was far beyond and above her work on ""Gilligan's Island"". By the time she was on that show she'd already been in several Broadway shows, had recorded this album, had won a Golden Globe for ""God's Little Acre"" and had been a nationally famous magazine covergirl and photography model. I also have an album of songs Marilyn Monroe sang in different movies and Tina's album measure up to Marilyn's in every respect."
3,This is a Rare Gem,"Bill Champlin can sing like crazy, and play any instrument in the band. I think Terry Haggerty probably took too much acid at some point in time, but still plays some nice spacey licks.The high points of this CD for me is ""Hey Children"" a nice shuffel blues track, and ""Beside You"" a nice ballad featuring Bills excellent falsetto.This is a great CD--don't be scared off by the 3 stars--I'm a tough grader."
4,The Difference Between Yams and Sweet Potatoes,"Years before cable TV became a household menace, P&G brought us this just-as-good-as Four or Five Crazy Guys production. While Phil's ""Roller Maidens..."" is equally fun, this tops my list of solo (or duo) efforts by the Theater. Ouch, I just hurt myself. Can someone get me a lozenge?"
4,excellent seller!,"Item was as described, good value and fast shipping. I would buy from this seller again without hesitation!"
2,Second rate Nascimento...give it a pass...,"I have three Nascimento disks and this is definitely the one I like least. ""Clube da Esquina"" is experimental (for its time, 1972) but joyously musical and engaging, while ""Minas"" tries to take the experimentation a bit further but runs off the rails. ""Minas"" just doesn't gel as a musical experience for me -- and certain touches like the children singing/chanting in track 1 and then intermittently in other tracks are especially offputting and, at least from today's perspective, cliched.""Travessia"" is a great disk in the more ""traditional"" or ""vintage"" Brazilian music mode (from 1967). So if you don't like experiments so much as a more traditional vintage sound ""Travessia"" will probably work for you. ""Clube Da Esquina"" experiments but focuses on offering great music and succeeds at that. ""Minas"" is not successful musically or experimentally, in my opinion."
5,Great video!,My students really enjoyed this video after reading the Mark Twain play. We developed a Venn Diagram between the two.
5,The best of them all!!!,"I saw this movie years ago, and have been stuck on it ever since. I've seen all of the other versions, but I find this one to be the best. The young prince was excellent, Jonathan Hyde did a wonderful job, and the late Alan Bates was actually a good father. All in All, I loved it!!!!"
4,A good value,"My daughter who is 6 saw this costume and had to have it. When it was delivered, she instantly put it on. It is beautiful on her and she loves it. The only negative is that the tulle is a little rough next to bare skin. It is not bad and wearing a shirt underneath will fix this issue. Plus. on Halloween I would want her to wear something underneath just to keep her warm. Overall, I thought this was a good costume for a good price."
2,New School Punk Rock Mostly,"The only reason why I don't rate this highly is because I don't like most of the bands in it. But you might:The Ataris, AFI, The (new) Vandals, MXPX, Gob, Snapcase, Refused, Descendents do ""I'm the One""... But anyway, I wanted to let you all know what is on this DVD. Stereo, color, running time is 80 minutes. This is volume 1. There are other volumes like this."
1,"CD/MP3 player failed, no service as company is bankrupt","I was in the market for a CD/MP3 player with ID tag compatibility and an Auxiliary input for when that inevitably was replaced by some newer technology. i searched the web and found a product that had great sound and power quality and the above options with a detachable faceplate. I thought it was heaven. So i got on E-bay and bought a used version of this product. The product was deleivered sans manual, so i searched again and began to see a distrubing pattern of reviews. While, the company that bought Jensen (when it went bankrupt) was kind enough to send me an electronci copy of the manual, the product has some serious flaws. After a few months of use, the CD/MP3 stops recognizing tracks, even on store bought CDs. Check the reviews out there before you buy this!"
4,Good Little Scrubber,"I bought this after a long, cold winter and feet that had been in boots for months. I came back to California, and my feet needed some serious therapy.Mr. Pumice was a success. I like this two sided bar because some parts of my foot are softer than others, and the dark purple can get too rough on my sensitive tootsies. Yes, there was purple shedding everywhere, but what do you expect from this kind of material? Honestly, that doesn't bother me as long as the scrubber works and lasts a reasonable amount of time, which it did."
4,great & unexpensive,"I first tried out the product at my sister-in-law's house and was amazed.The product has a long lifetime and is so cheap,i would recommend it to everybody."
1,WARNING: ***NOT PUMICE!***,"Although this product is listed as ""pumice"" is it NOT pumice -- which is exclusively the natural material. It is STYROFOAM-like man-made junk that crumbles on the first use."
1,"Ineffective, styrofoam-like block makes a mess","The Mr. Pumice ""stone"" was a waste of money. It didn't work, dropped a lot of granules and made a mess. The block felt like a piece of flimsy styrofoam. I would not recommend this product."
5,pedicure perfection,"There is nothing like this product for ""callus management"". If you collect cute sandals, this is for you."
5,Used these for years,I love Mr. Pumice. I use it every time I take a shower. They wear out and the are disposable... So dont expect it to last forever. It works great on my feet as well as my moms. she has very dry cracked heels and i have realitivly soft feet... but i get dry from time to time. But I love this product.
2,Not what I expected,"Upon arrival of this book(let) I was confused....did I actually order this? It seemed to be a small primer for young children by it's simplistic text and odd illustrations. In order to make this a 46 page book the numbering of pages began with the first sheet of paper in the publication, including publishing information, contents page. It was quite a strech to call this a book and not a pamphlet. I cannot recommend this book for parents looking for answers or help on the subject, it is too broad and vague. It may be a good book for a sibling in upper grades of elementary or middle school to help them understand a siblings diagnosis however and for that purpose I could recommend reading this book. As with all books I would read it first before passing it to a child to read but for your own edification I would skip this process!"
5,Unique and valuable,"Gunilla Gerland's book is designed for children with high-functioning autism and Asperger's to read as a step to understanding their diagnosis. As far as I know, it is one of the very few books of this type in existence, and it does its job excellently. Blaming it for not being a book for parents seems beside the point."
2,Finding out about Asperger's Syndrome....,I did not find this book(let) to be very helpful. It was a sparsely written book that appeared to stretch out the very little information to a few words per page to make it a 46 page book. There was information that could explain the syndrome and associated symptoms to young children but was too simplistic for an adult to gain much aid from. Even the pictures were simple and the combination made the book appear to have beena hurried and poorly planned venture on the part of the author and/or publisher. I cannot recommend this book for a broad overview of AS or High functioning Autism. There was not enough information to make this book a good value.
2,Disappointing.,"I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this book. I usually do, but I guess it was an impulse purchase. In my quest to find out more information regarding my son's difficulties and diagnoses I am trying to read all I can. The information regarding how many pages this book is should be listed. It is a tiny booklet that is specifically for children or adolescents. It is not at all what I hoped it would be."
1,Disappointed - no English subtitle and no closed caption!,"TV show of ""I Dream of Jeannie"" was great and it still is one of my favorite TV series of all time, but I am very deeply disappointed that there is no English subtitle nor closed caption neither. How couldn't video company neglect our educational needs such as English subtitle? We suggest you to avoid this product for two major reasons: 1) no English subtitle/no closed caption and 2) there is no list of episodes in this product - that made me difficult to find which episodes and so, I had to look on DVD plate info. There was no real Jeannie bottle in this product which it said ""Jeannie bottle included"" and it turned out to a pink cardboard bottle of Jeannie bottle - a gimmick."
1,Still waiting for the right stuff on 1/12,"If the factory had properly picked the components, the item would not have to be returned for exchange.... the contents had 2 copies of the #6 disc and 0 of the #7..... I hope when the replacement arrives, it will be correct....... UPS picked this up on 1/2, and the tracking for the replacment by USPS NEVER seems to be updated. Even though the delivery should have been on 1/10 the on line tracking still said it was transmitted for pick up by USPS. Too bad UPS is not used for the shipments AND pick up...."
4,Should Have Waited!!,"I was 7 years old when I first remember watching IDOJ back in the early 70's. The bottle fascinated me,and I use to draw it on construction paper and cut it out. Anyway, I only stumbled across this beautiful box set after I had already purchased the 1st. three individual seasons..aaarrrhhh..I'm so mad. I will have to see if I can sell them because I want this box set. For those folk who wrote bad reviews about the cardboard ""bottle"", they can always buy real bottle replicas from the many people out there who make them. I have one, and a little Jeannie ornament that fits perfectly in the top appearing to look out as she did in the show!"
4,I,I Dream of Jeannie the whole series is fun for the whole family. I purchased it for my 10 & 13 year olds and we have been having so much fun watching this as a family. We have had so many laughs and conversations have come out of this purchase that I highly recommend it to any family that is looking for some good clean tv time with the whole family. We look forward to the nights so we can all sit together and watch an episode. Any age can watch and get ready for the fun. My 13 year old son laughs from beginning to end - he loves to watch what they do to Dr. Bellows the poor guy!!! Well worth the price.
4,Interesting Package,I purchased these videos not expecting or knowing they would be packaged within a Jeannie bottle. I was not pleased but they were a gift and the person I purchased them for said the dics being contained in a Jeannie bottle was alright. I would have preferred a disc packaging.
4,Maravilloso contenido,"Fue, de nina, mi serie favorita y tenerla es revivir mi infancia. Aunque la primera temporada es colorizada eso no altera su contenido. Toda la serie es MARAVILLOSA. La recomiendo. La estrella que no les di es porque el empaque de los DVDs es impráctico (viene en una ""sinfonía"" de cartón que se abre y se caen los DVDs al piso, eso me sucedió). Hay que cambiarlos a cajas plásticas para preservarlos. La botella debería ser, al menos, de plástico (viene de cartón)."
4,A wonderful classics to be enjoyed for years !!,"I used to watch I Dreamt of Jeanine when I was young, and I've loved it ever since. I must confess, every episode is warm, funny and surprising! I would love to give it a 5 star, but the cheap cardboard ""bottle"" needs a makeover. Perhaps if they invest more in material, it would be more sturdy (e.g. use plastic or at least woodply) So, I'm not displaying the bottle, and keep it in the case.I know my family enjoys every Friday night watching this series!"
3,I dream of Jeannie: special packaging.,"I purchased the box set of ""I Dream Of Jeannie"". Love the show, the concept of the packaging is cute, but not practical! For the price that Amazon offers, it's a good deal."
5,Awesome,I love the bottle it came in.. The disc's are inside the bottom of the bottle. It's a really neat gift idea
4,Great DVD - Lousy and Dangerous Bottle,"Altogether the collection is nice (although season 1 is colored)My only deception with this collection is the ""bottle"". I own over 500 DVD's at home and this is THE single most hazardous box to hold a collection of DVD's.Each DVD is inserted in a sleeve and all these sleeves are glued together in an ""accordeon"" type of holder. I use term ""glued"" very loosely: 1 tiny drop of glue at the top of the sleeve and another tiny one at the bottom.Then you slip this ""accordeon"" sideways ""inside"" the ""bottle"". If you try to lift the bottle by its ""neck"", chances are all your DVD's will slip to the floor faster than Jeannie could blink!...Even getting a DVD out of this ""accordeon"" is hazardous; picture 20 DVD's held in a barely glued cardboard Slinky and you will have a pretty accurate idea!!!Word from the wise: forget about keeping the DVD'S it their original holder... Put your them in a safer box!"
4,Complete Classic Series of Jeannie,The series are wonderful with good quality DVD's. The only downfall with the set is that the DVD's are not secure enough and can fall out. That is the only reason I gave it a 4 star.
5,Seen In The Blink Of An Eye,This was a pleasure ride through memory lane. All 5 seasons brought me back to my childhood when I saw the series on NBC all those years ago.This collection is a must have!!!
2,Clumsy to use,"I didn't have any problems at all with the Internet-based rate update, unlike others reporting problems here. Unfortunately, though, the scale is a huge pain to use: you place an item to be weighed, hit HOLD, then the ""shipper"" button to select the carrier, then the ""service"" button to indicate delivery type. Only then do you see the rate. It then requires three keystrokes to prepare to weigh another item, after which EACH of the steps above must be repeated since the settings aren't persistent from one weighing to the next. Bottom line: this scale is functional but not really useful; it's clear that the people who designed this don't actually ship packages very often, and that they didn't solicit feedback from anyone who does."
4,postal scale,"I purchased this because my daughter had this exact same model and was very happy with it. I, too am very happy with it and glad I made the purchase."
2,An expensive scale,"This product does a good job weighing packages, but the calculator for determining rates to foreign countries does not work. It's a frustrating machine. I would not buy another one."
1,Royal slow to provide updated rates,"US Postal rate changes went into effect today, 5/14/07 and Royal has not provided updated rates for download onto this scale.A call to customer support revealed there was no definitive date when the rates would be available. ""Try again in a couple of days.""This is an unbelievable failure of customer support.This equals lost $ for you as you tediously look up rates on a chart or on the internet, and wait for the rate update that is coming who knows when.The RC40's value is its ability to quickly look up rates. Not having current rates available makes the RC40 no better than a scale costing $5.Although I must admit the RC40 makes a very nice (although expensive) paperweight."
1,UGH!!! Worthless!!!!!,"I purchased this for Ebay. I thought it worked just fine... but the post office kept telling me that I was putting too much postage on my packages. Those were the ""up to date"" rates the scale was giving me! Then I had to reformat my computer and that meant re-installing the RC40 software on my computer (which was not a hard thing to do) BUT from then on, this thing will ABSOLUTELY NOT download the new shipping rates from the internet. It keeps telling me that for a regular letter, the postage is $0.34... and we all know that's not true. This is a waste of good money. You're better off buying a cheap $10.00 scale for weighing and just look up the rates on the internet. Don't waste your time or money on this thing. Oh yeah... I emailed customer service at Royal and never heard from them."
1,Nice looking junk.,"I've never written a review but this product deserves it.This product is junk. I bought mine off eBay for $70 or so.When I tried to program the pricing data you could not read the""Download?"" on the scale-screen it was garbled. I kept tryingand the PC software would just hang saying it was erasing memory.Eventually the ""Download?"" was visible and I got it to program.Then the batteries went dead and I could never get it programmedagain. The company's site is awful. Do yourself a favor andlook for a different product."
4,A quality Scale,"The scale itself is a great unit, and quite acurate. Also it is very functional. The unit is currently to ship internet placed orders. Overall this is a good piece, but the support from Royal leaves alot to be desired."
2,"Not fit for measuring, in order to sell a pound of chocolate","The machine I bought at Staples, measured a certain item accurately, how ever, if I needed to sell a pound of chocolate, I kept adding to scale, little bit at a time, untill, it got to 16 oz, and when I remeasured the chocolate, it was actually 18.4 oz. Thats a loss of 2.4 oz every customer we sold a pound of chocolate to. This may be good for a postal scale and not beyond that.I was measuring ingredients to make soap and they were measured inaccurately as the digital scale is insensitive to a small addition until it is 0.4 oz or more of change. messed up the whose recipe.The scale only reads 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 etc and the odd digits are missing. Although you rarely see an increase as you add to the scale in that order. It usually goes up by 0.4 or 0.6 at a time. When you remeasure it, it is a different weight altogether.At first I was excited.... this has really turned out to be too good to be true. Yes it is too bad."
2,"Weighs OK, no support, downloads gone","The scale performs its basic function well enough, which is weighing packages. I've even weighed packages over 40 lbs successfully. But it's very annoying to use. Actually finding a rate on the scale, if you can get them downloaded successfully, requires pushing a number of buttons in the right order. Plus you can't alter the rates to match any discounts you might have gotten from the shipper. I quickly gave up on trying to use it to find rates -- the web is faster and more accurate. A major annoyance for me is that you can't set it to stay on until you shut it off. It will shut off after one minute of non-use, and you can't change that. Good if you use batteries, but I have mine connected to an AC adapter, so I'd like it to stay on until I shut it off. Finally, it looks like software downloads for these are no more.... Oh well, at least it does weigh accurately and is still working."
1,Royal pile of stinking dung,"Anybody who got theirs to update should consider themselves lucky. If you like making multiple calls to Indian call centers to receive worthless advice, buy this scale. If you want to waste money on replacement serial cables, buy this scale. If like repeating the same process over and over and receiving the same lame error message, buy this scale. If you enjoy wasting hours of your time, by all means buy this scale. YES I know how to read and follow directions, and YES I know what I'm doing around computers. IT DOESN'T MATTER!!!!!!"
3,"Limited customer support, but low price","My RC40 successfully downloaded the latest software update from the company site. However, the scales then stopped working. Royal provides a customer support phone number (non-toll free), where I waited on hold a long time for a person and then was transfered to another person's voice mail. Royal's site also offers an an email address (...) where Royal promises to respond to your email within ""two to three weeks."" However, a customer service rep did return my call within one day, and told me to return the product to the place I bought it. I also checked prices and was not able to find any similar machine at a competitive price. And so I have increased my rating of the product to 3 stars on account of low price. But it is a good idea to buy an extended warranty at original purchase in case you have to return it."
5,engaging!,Fantastic book that makes it insanely difficult to put down. Tomasso has a way of building his characters that makes you want to know about their lives. The story is quick to build but details are not missed. Great read.
1,NOT 18/10 AS DESCRIBED,I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I RECEIVED THIS FLATWARE. THE DESCRIPTION STATED IT WAS 18/10 AND IT IS ACTUALLY 18/0. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IF YOU WANT STURDY FLATWARE.
5,Excellent service/fast shippment,Excellent service/fast shippment. Will order a back up item when in stock from same supplier!
4,Great TV,"We bought this product under some semi-expert's recommendation and it turned out he's right. We were told that Sharp has devoted much R&D; in the development of LCD TVs and by far is among the best and that this model is more advanced than other Sharp 37 Inch models (in terms of resolution & etc.) Sony has good LCD TVs but is generally more expensive. If you were ever in the store comparing different LCDs and there picture quality you wouldn't even be considering certain other brands.Anyway we are happy with this product. This model only has 37 Inch and 45 Inch, the latter is way out of our budget. So although we had wanted something more like a 40 o4 42 inch, we have to settle for a 37 -- it's not that bad actually. Also some Sony TVs has a feature with you can connect your computer to the TV so the TV serves as the moniter when you play video files on computer. I wish this Sharp had that too."
4,Yes you can hook this up to your computer,"for the individual that stated before that he wasn't able to hook up this model to his computer, I can. It comes with the s-video hookup with which most new computers now come with it standard as one of the features. So unless you have a macintosh from the 80's you should be able to plug it right in. :)"
1,Mr. Blue,TV broke 3 weeks ago. Sharp has a no return policy. Now suffering through the repair process. I deeply regret this purchase.
3,Not as good a panasonic plasma,"I own both this Aquous and a 37 inch Panasonic plasma TV. As good as the Sharp is, it is not as brilliant and exciting as the Panasonic, which looks almost 3d sometimes. I have waited about three months to make my final decision but the Plasma wins.."
4,The swashbuckling continues,"Carter's fantasy, an open tribute to Edgar Rice Burrough'sBarsoomsaga, continues in this fourth book of the series. The first sentence in the story reads, ""I had only minutes to live."" That sets the headlong pace for our hero, accompanied by a winged man from a long-lost race, a chitinous Kalood who has learned the emotion of friendship, and a ""bold and daring young princeling."" Together, they set off after Niamh the Fair, a princess chronically in need of being saved. Little things like the giant serpent from the ruined temple of an ancient death-cult decorate their landscape, assuring plenty of fun for all.You get the general idea. It's all there: the hero so honorable that he stumbles over his own nobility, the bumbling romantic confusion, powerful but deranged bad guys, and swords-and-zapguns combat. It's not one to remember (even if you try), but good escapist adventure anyway.-- wiredweird"
3,Good movie,Very entertaing if you're into the style of music and dance themes. Good follow up to the first movie and has a slight message built in.
4,Fun movie,"MY good friend is a huge fan of the ""Step Up"" movies and this is one of her favorites. The dancing is great and it has a pretty good story line."
4,step up 2 the streets,It had a few scratches on it which caused it not to play the first time. Cleaned it and it was good.
3,My favorite dancers...,"are in this, so that was really the only reason I bought ""Step Up 2: The Streets"". Otherwise, it was alright overall."
3,Fun Movie,Acting is bland; piture quality is mediocre; But movie is very entertaining especailly if you appreciate dancing & urban music
5,It is so good to wacth and dancing.,I love the movies it was so good wacth and will make you cry and smile and laungth too.
5,step up 1 rocks so will 2.,IM excited for 2 to come out since i did not get to see it in theaters. but hope channing tamtum gf on the 1st is on second if not it would be a dissapointment. heard its great so thats why igave it 5 stars hopefully ithink the same when iwatch it.
2,"Meh, wouldn't recommend","Entire ""Step Up"" franchise is something I approach as movie junk food/with low expectations, but first movie and Step Up Revolution were much better in my opinion, in terms of acting and dancing. Not a fan of Briana Evigan - just got sucked into a holiday movie she did, and regretted that as well, think I will avoid her in the future."
5,If only there was 6 stars,What could be a better dance movie series than the step up franchise. I don't know it and i don't know if i want to!
4,A Step Above what you think this movie would be like,"The music and dancing just blew me away. Way cool! The story itself is quite nice, but just watch the way all the actors can move! I was strapped in my seat because I watched this movie in the airplane, but if I was at home, nothing could have stopped me from dancing along (or kind of). I love Andie, the heroine. She had skill in acting, dancing, and always had a cool outfit (not to mention).This movie is kind of different from the first, but not any worse. Go ahead and buy this movie, or rent it at Blockbuster. But first make sure that when you watch it, you have the speakers on loud and have plenty of space to dance!"
3,Double order,I was charged for and sent two and have no need for the additional productm and would like to send one back
4,Epic ending!,"Held my attention the whole time, the story wasn't bad and the final dance sequence was epic. I have no more words."
2,Nothing gained in tracing two rabits simultaneously,"When I decided to buy this title, frankly I worried that how well Osprey would jam so broad story into tiny volume in their well known chronicle fashion. Then alas, I had to ease my mind with a small charge with this book. In summary, if you are a novice then you can think that would be enough for that price. If you're hobbist, some nice illustration of the internal scenes of Sturmg 3 and other case for various vehicles will be referable. If you're bit knowledged, don't give any glimpse at this book. Touched here and there without points and no new photo. Just licking over chewing gum!. sorry for crude my English."
2,New Vanguard series... more like in retreat mode.,"Yet another dissapointing book in the New Vanguard series... The book is disorganized jumping from Pz I to Tigers and back, wide spectrum descriptions that not even scratch the surface of the actual use, doctrines and effectiveness of the Sturmartillerie and Panzerjagers.One of the poorest Osprey books."
1,Turned into Water Wiggle first week... :-(,"Remember the Water Wiggle toy from the 70s that chased kids around the backyard with a insane spray of water? In the first week of use the input feed coupling on the side of the box came apart from the box. Plugged the coupling back in, but continues to come out. The problem appears that the design of the coupling is such that it will not handle the pressure if there is a cut-off on the hose. So when I turn off the water when I move from one area to another, the coupling cannot handle the pressure and shoots off, spraying water all over the box, patio, furniture... Looking at the coupling appears it just has a flimsy plastic notch to hold onto the box - very poor design. Returned box for a refund as this appears to be a design defect inherent in all boxes. Too bad, nice concept. Also the Suncast web site has no useful info on products. :-( Sigh, can someone please make a product that doesn't come apart under normal use?"
2,"Works well, until the fitting on the reel splits.","As with all of these plastic reels, the fitting that is on the reel that the primary hose feeds into splits and sprays water out constantly unless the valve is shut off.The reel pulls in the hose very evenly and effectively. Its also pretty easy.The other problem is that unless you fasten it to something or put heavy rocks on top, it will likely just fall over when you're pulling your hose out.This would be a 10 if the parts that mattered were metal and didn't break, and if it didn't fall over when you pulled your hose."
3,"Broke immediately, but can be repaired","The unit stores and reels a 100 ft hose very easily. However, the feed hose occasionally pops off and floods the area around the box. I contacted suncast by email and they quickly sent a replacement part at no charge. Some dis/assembly work is needed to change the part."
2,Don't buy this box!,"I bought this box about 8 months ago and it worked fine for most of that time. The box does tip over sometimes when your pulling the hose out and you get 1/2 the hose out. The box also has to sit perfectly level or the plastic twists and the lid won't close tightly. Also, the wind up reel and automatic winder sometimes get out of sync, which causes you to move the spindle to a place where the unit will work properly again. The worst thing about this box is that the spindle the hose wraps around is made of plastic and will break, as mine did, rendering the box useless. $[...] bucks, down the drain! Get a metal hose winder or a more sturdy one than this piece of junk!"
2,Do not purchase,"I am very disappointment with my purchase. It is big and heavy and does not always stay in place when you pull the hose. You actually have to manually turn the hose handle to get the hose out. It does not prevent kinks in the hose. Also, you have to buy a o-ring to prevent it from leeking at the water source. I'm only giving it two stars because it does keep the hose contained which was my main objective. This is the kind of product I suggest buying at a store so you can see it's size first."
2,I wouldn't buy another one,"I found most of the problems other reviewers noted (e.g. tipping over, hose not tracking, etc.) Now the hose won't even roll up because the mechanism gears don't appear to be aligned. I've used it very little (probably less than 8 times) before it failed. Save your money and buy something that is a better design."
3,THEY'RE ALL THE SAME,"THIS IS THE 2ND HOSE HIDEAWAY THAT I'VE PURCHASES FROM AMAZON(SUNCAST). THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH THEM IS THAT THE HOSE CONNECTOR IS MADE OF PLASTIC. THEY BREAK VERY EASILY. EAST TO STRIP IF YOU OVERTIGHTEN. I HAVE A PERFECTLY GOOD HIDEAWAY SITTING IN MY GARAGE THAT CANT BE USED BECAUSE THE PLASTIC CONNECTOR IS LOOSE AND THERE IS NO WAY TO FIX IT!!! IS THERE A DURABLE,WELL MADE HIDEAWAY? I'D BUY IT IF THERE WERE."
1,Lasted 3 months then hinges broke inside,"It was a good for about a month then the hose dessert starting getting stuck... After 3 months the wheel hinges broke inside the unit and it became useless. Barely used this thing, maybe 15 times... It was my second and last Suncast product. Stay away, these people make junk !"
2,Not up to par,Can't stand this thing--it tips over if you pull the hose out over half way and the lid flys off even with the slightest breeze. It also seems to attract flies. Not worth the money
1,Terrible product,"First time i tried to use the reel, as soon as I turned on the water at the faucet, the inlet blew off and sprayed water everywhere. This is the third suncast product I have purchased and they are all terrible. I will be returnig and purchasing a new product made by any other manufacturer."
1,Not durable,"For the 2 months I used it last summer, it worked great. I hooked it up this summer and the part where the feed hose connects to the box popped off. I tried to call Suncast and got a very nice recording from their consumer help line saying to leave a message and they'd call me back only for it to be followed up with message that the inbox is full and they cannot take my message. Next time, I'm buying a metal one, not plastic."
1,Cheap plastic ruins great idea.,This product uses plastic hose connector couplings when it should be using brass. Heavy duty hose will not stay connected and will ruin the the cheap plastic threads.
1,Beware of plastic Coupling,"I agree with L Courtney, the hose reel box is a great concept but the 'flimsy' plastic notch on the coupling will break and render the whole box useless. I recently bought a house and the prior homeowner left behind Suncast Hose Reel box.The first use, I turned on the water, nothing happened...so I leaned up close to 'inspect' at the exact moment the side hose disengaged and shot water in my face, soaked my hair and clothes, the deck and anything within a 8-10' range. Sad thing here is that I thought it must have been an operator error and the plastic coupling had not been pushed in all the way...so I tried again. I sloshed back to the hose. I'm rethinking the 'gift' from the prior homeowner.Thanks to L.C. for the Water Wiggle memory...didn't it have an upside-down yellow cup with a face?"
4,David Rymel,When I was looking for a garden hose rewinder . I Researched first the auto winder the reviews were not encouraging. I saw the suncast and thought I would try it. It was great buy. The winder has reduction gears and I wound a hundred foot hose on it nothing flat. I would reccomend this. Dave Suncast SMT200B Hose Hideaway with Smart Trak Hose Guide
5,I am very pleased with it.,I like this little filter. It seems to keep the oil in and the dirt out. That is the reason I bought it and it works!
5,Top Quality Flatware,"This is top of the line flatware, very heavy hot forged solid material. You won't be bending these spoons on hard ice cream ! The set I received is fully polished (easier to keep clean), with very good attention to detail, in between the tines of the forks and the pierced openings on the spoons are the only areas not fully polished. All the handles are solid, half round on all the items except the knives, which feature a slab sided oval contour.As far as price goes, the average price I've found matches Amazon's, but with a combination of the Friday sale and incentive bonus made a $1.75 a piece quite a bargain."
5,I recommend this seller,"I received my book before expected, which is always a good thing. It arrived in the condition that it was described.I would recommend this seller to someone looking for used textbooks."
3,ok,"ok, but i had to purchase the newer edition of the textbook because this one has some inaccurate info. was not the fault fo the seller though."
1,Who dun such awful writing?,"I picked this book up at a bookstore and clearly didn't make a wise purchase. For those of you who really like mystery and suspense, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! The writing is terrible and if you really like mystery and suspense, these are not the authors for you. Although I should qualify that and state that after the first two stories, I did not read the last two because I was sure they were probably the same style as the first two. The stories have no real plot other than ""tired and bored city girl meets hunk and has sex with him."" In fact the first two stories are so short on plot, suspense and writing ability that you could swear they were written by the same hand. Even the author's beloved sex scenes are poorly done and sound like the ramblings of an adolescent.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book. It is awful! The only mystery contained within these pages is how and why they were actually published."
1,I was so disappointed!,"Mary Janice Davidson is a hit or miss author with me and this story most definitely MISSED. I couldn't deal with the character motivations. They just made no sense.Amy Garvey's story was okay...it wasn't predictable per se, but it also didn't pull me in.Jennifer Apodaca's story was by far the best. She engaged me and interested me in the plot. it was a BIT predictable but by FAR the best.Nancy Cohen is a mystery writer so I expected her story to be the best. It was the worst. There were continuity errors all over the place. The romance wasn't developed at all.This was one of the weakest and worst edited Bravas I've read."
1,Complete waste of time,"I could review each short story individually, but they'd all merit roughly the same response: awful. They were raunchy and juvenile, reading as if they were thrown together in a weekend without any serious editing. A fringe of mystery as an excuse for sex scenes, mostly, with shallow characters and weak, rushed plots. Hardly worth the time it took to read.I expected better from these authors. Do yourself a favor and pick up Davidson's 'Undead' series instead."
1,Doubt I'd try them again.........,I couldn't even get through the first story in this book. The writing was so horrible and I could not follow the plot at all. I moved on to the next but it was just as bad as the first. Unfortunately this was the first book I had read by any of these authors so I'm not sure if I'll try one of their novels again.
1,Waste of money,"This product did not work. It didn't clean my coffee pot, only left it with a funny smell that took forever to rinse out. Don't waste your money!"
5,Good to hear Three dog night after three decades,I have really enjoyed this CD and it has brought back good memories of the seventies time era. This CD really does have all of their greatest hits and I recommend this one to anyone who was a teen in the seventies.
2,CD Quality,"The quality of the CD (not the music) is poor. Trouble getting a number of songs to play and have to hit the skip button and return etc. I am sure Chuck Negron wouldn't approve of this! However, this is an exception based on the number of purchases from Amazon."
3,3 Dog Nite 20 GH's,"Good music and the product is functional. However, the sound does not have the warmth that the live performances do nor does it sound as good. Recommend buying live performance over this one."
2,Not Appropriate for a Music Instrument,"In my opinion, any case for an instrument should protect that instrument. I think this case does a very poor job of that. It is a soft case. What kind of idiot would store a quality, fragile, wood instrument in a case that cannot protect it from crushing? Of course I realized this when I bought the item, but this was the only case available for the instrument. If they had a hard case available, I would have bought it instead.If you really do want a soft case for your instrument, I would recommend this case. It is well made. However, don't be deluded with false secuirty. This case will provide only very minimal protection.Mark"
2,Not Really Western Swing,"The title of the DVD is somehow misleading. You'll be embarrassed if you expect rare footage of the Western Swing legends in concert. Almost all of the tracks are taken from old Western B-movies of the 30s and 40s, with the musicians standing on a porch, in the woods or a similar scenario, the music (back then) was synchronized.Nice piece of nostalgia, but worthless if you are looking for the ""real"" Western Swing of those bygone days."
3,An adventerous life and times viewed from a social historia,"A surpassing interest in the first of anything is as old asAdam. Just as we are different from the first man and yet in many waysstill the same, Dean Mohamed is also different from the first of Amitav Ghosh, Arundhati Roy, Vikram Chandra, or Shashi Tharoor... You name them .The main difference is in the use of the language and the market targeted. The similarity lies in the location and contemporary timing of subject matter - their own India!"
1,Not the original versions,"The tracks are not the original release versions. Labeling states: ""All songs recorded 1994"""
1,Just not good,I do not like this cd either the songs are not even the original versions and it just seemed kind of dull. Super Hit collections on most singers are always not good at all.
1,1.5 Stars,"Basically, there is only one reason I got this album: for ""God Bless the USA"". Still, it is the only song I like on the album. If you like that song, get a compilation CD. If you don't like it, don't bother."
2,"Item not as pictured, very disappointed. Not a great throw. Fast shipping though.","Item not as pictured--totally different style, and not appropriate for the person I bought it for (it was a gift). Very disapointed."
1,Invest in something better,Very itchy and the second it snagged on something (the day I first used it) a lot of yarn got pulled out and bunched up. I never wore it again. Don't waste your money!
1,Going to Hell for This One...,"I'm sure all those alterno-folk hipsters out there who worship the ground that Ms. Lord walks upon will wish me a slow and painful death but...She stinks like a forgotten Easter egg! Yes, it may seem hard to believe but it's true. Her voice makes me cringe, her wigs are aweful (indeed she has a fetish for wigs) and she is not the brightest bulb around. All and all I wish that people could see through her image and cut to the heart of the matter and they would find that there is nothing much there to get excited about. If there was a negative star rating she'd get about a -3. Guess what, Unwound makes me puke too."
1,Lathered In 30 Weight Motor Oil,"Voice like a cheese grater and slightly less talented than all the occupants of the short bus put together, Mary Lou squeaks and sqawks her way through bad covers and even worse originals. She belongs in the subway where she can't do the general populace anymore harm."
4,A window into a very different world,"One of the great things about fiction is that not only do you get the fun of plot and characters, sometimes you really can learn something. This book really opened the eyes of both my husband and I about the world of 1950's Watts and the whole red-baiting McCarthyism scene. Pretty scary stuff but a good thing for two white boomers.EZ Rawlins continues to grown as a character. Clay's narration on the unaudited tape is terrific. The side characters are pretty interesting. The plot is solid and has a dandy twist at the end. Still, what lingers with me is the scenes of black life - the churches, the bars, EZ's wisdom on concealing his wealth.A good read if you like mysteries and/or are interested in a look at African-American culture from a point of view other than the Oprah books."
3,OK READ,"Just ok as a listen. The storyline, unlike Mr. Mosely's later works in this series seems more contrived and predictable. It's good to read this series in order if possible so you know the history of the characters and see how they grow. I highly recommend that which I didn't do, but still enjoy them in the audio format."
3,NOTHING SPECIAL!!,"This is the first Walter Mosley book I have read. Everybody seems to be rating this author very highly and say that his books are amazing. I'm not convinced. It seems like an ordinary mystery story to me. The dialogue and language is a lot more relaxed than you would find in most books which makes it easy to read. Nevertheless, I found a lot of it hard to follow and found that I got bored with it very easily even though I did manage to finish it. It is worth reading but don't expect anything special because it really isn't. The characters are very believable but they suffer from a disjointed and in some ways unbelieveable story. Make your own mind up. I prefer John Grisham every day of the week and twice on Sundays."
3,Where's the bass,"Owned for three weeks and decided there wasn't enough bass (no seal problems here). Even classical sounded lacking without decent bass.Also lacked ambience - transients - the sound of notes decaying and richocheting around your ear drums. I got used to this, though, and didn't mind it.The bass I minded - even if just for classical, but there is also rock where bass is even more important!Decision made."
1,Great sound... when they work,"These headphone sound great, but they are FAR TOO FRAGILE and break all the time. I've had mine for 3 months and in that time I've had to replace the earphone components 4 times! (They come with 6 replacements if that tells you how often you can anticipate these headphone failing.)Now I'm out of replacements, am in Asia where I can't easily get any, and have a 22 hour noisy flight tomorrow and a pair of $300 headphones that only work in 1 ear."
1,no bass,"I checked these earphones against the ones that came with my iPod. The Apple earphones offer a much richer sound, deeper and more bass. According to a separate little warning that comes with the ER-4P it is important that complete closure is achieved, perhaps by moisturizing the earbuds, or the bass will not be there. I followed the advice. But it doesn't bring the sound up to the level of the Apple earphones, not close."
5,Etymotic Research ER4S,"This is my third set of these earphones. As a production Sound Mixer I first bought a pair for High Noise monitoring. For this they worked as good as my regular headphones, but with the added bonus of being a fraction of the weight and a lot more comfortable during a 10 hour work day. They handle the full spectrum audio well including the bass response and are not tinny like some earbuds that are on the market. My last pair I took with me on a reality show in Palau Micronesia and once again they performed well, until they were caught on a tree branch. When I returned them to Etymotic for repair I experienced fast and excellent repair at no charge, as the earphones were still under warranty. As an added bonus these fit under a crash helmet and help keep wind noise down whilst riding my bike."
4,Secure Hoop Diamond Earring,"Great idea and nicly made. Diamonds good. Locks good, could be just a bit stronger, can feel some play in lock that should not be there, but they seem to be holding very well. Nice weight. Good price."
5,Best earrings ever,"Do you want super-comfortable earrings that look great with everything you wear? Then these are the earrings for you.If you're prone to yanking off earrings when you pull on a turtleneck sweater, these are the earrings for you.Sleep in them, shower in them, play soccer or snorkel while wearing them. These earrings stay put, and look great.I just wish they had some inlaid with Australian opals; I might be tempted to take the ones I'm currently wearing off long enough to try the opals."
3,Good for a beginner player only,"This is a good product for an extremely novice player. I got bored with it after only a few minutes. Conceptually, it is a good product to help a new player understand cue ball movement and improve the accuracy of their stroke. For an intermediate player, this product is too remedial.If you can't shoot using English or don't understand how English will effect the cue ball movement, I would recommend this product for you. If you use English successfully in your game, I would not recommend this product at all."
2,Cheap isn't always better,"I have had this item for months and its ability to punch through normal lightweight paper began to degrade rather quickly. In addition, the guide used to make sure the punch was lined up wasn't 100%, so I had a lot of crooked pages. Loading the comb was always hit or miss, but once it was on, the pages went on the combs rather smoothly. It doesn't work on your larger combs (1""+) and the prongs that is used to keep the comb in place breaks easily (I had to return my first one because several of the teeth had breaks at the bottom). The kicker was when some paper got stuck in the punch mechanism, completely locked it up and I had to rip the paper out of the machine to release it.Overall, it's was good while it lasted."
3,Terse walkthrough for OpenBSD admins,"This book is a raw front-to-back walkthrough of the OpenBSD operating system targeted a systems administrators. There are no diagrams or pictures anywhere in the book. It consists entirely of Courier type shell work with terse exposition to hold it together.I can recommend this book if you are a Systems Administrator for OpenBSD and you are looking for something to guide you through the morass of commands in a step by step manner. And even then, I think you should look at the book in person first to make sure that it covers the topic you are interested in adequately."
3,Intro to OpenBSD? Yes. About security architecture? No.,"I should have read the other reviews:""at first glance the title may lead you to believe it's about securing OpenBSD - it's not. It is about using an inherently secure operating system, OpenBSD, to its best advantage.""Fair enough. As an introduction to OpenBSD for those with experience with other Unix systems, this is a great book. But I can read the man pages and other documentation. I wanted a book that discussed a way to build secure networks with OpenBSD as one component.The chapter on VPN setup is the best that I have seen on that subject. But otherwise, it's a walk-through of basic installation and configuration.I also purchased ""Building Firewalls with OpenBSD and PF"", and it is more what I was looking for: less about OpenBSD itself, and more about how to apply the system to protect your network."
5,Love this ball!,"Great ball, not too hard not too soft. I bought the Navy ball and love it. I highly recommend this ball."
4,nice ball,Used this for indoor volleyball and found it to be one of the best volleyball I have ever used. Firm and weigh just enough for competition volleyball.
5,V-Ball,"This is the second ball.... We play hard and beat the hell out of it...The price , including shipping , beats Dicks Sporting by $20+ !!!!!!"
5,A Grab bag of goodies !,This accessory kit for digital photographers is a grab bag of goodies and a must have for any digital photographer. The Canon HF-DC1 high powered flash alone is worth the price of the accessory kit since thesehard-to-find flash guns sell for well over $100.00.
4,Did not recieve the official one.,I ordered this headset because I wanted to give one as a gift since when I ordered my V360 phone it came with a Motorola 2.5mm headset for use with the phone.The title and picture suggest that it is the OEM Motorola headset since the picture looks exactly like the one I have but upon arrival from AccessoryOne the headset was not the OEM one. When comparing this one to the OEM one the sound and mic sensitivity was lower.When I meant to put 4 stars that was meant to be for the one in the title and picture not for the offbrand that I recieved. I would have gave it 5 stars but the mic was a bit far from my mouth so it might pick up some background noise.
3,Nothing Special,Your basic ear bud headset. Works OK. Most of the people I talk to when I'm using it say it sounds faint - definitely much softer than not using it. It has good sound to my ear but I'm still looking for one that does a better job of carrying my voice.
1,Crackly whenever you move the connector,"It fits nicely, but if you move the connector it crackles. Cheap price, cheap product."
3,You get what you pay for,"Not a great product. Everyone I call complains about how ""distant"" I sound, and I have to hold the little microphone up to my mouth or clip it to my collar (if I'm wearing one). The earpiece doesn't stay too well either. I only spent three bucks on it so I can't complain too much. But I'm surprised Motorola puts its name on these things. It's almost complete junk."
1,Broken,It didn't work from the start. I have an Android and it didn't even fit. Plus if you have a case don't even bother.
1,Does not fit a Motorola Driod maxx,"I bought 3 pairs of these for my wife, mother and I and even though it says they will fit the motorola driod it doesn't. I sent them back and sent a email to the seller about getting my money back and have not gotten any response."
3,Robs review,"Products works good. Performence wise its a good unit, but is uncomfortable. Needs a clip. Put one on it from an old broken setand it is much better."
4,Good sound quality but uncomfortable,"This product is exceptionally convenient, and for the most part when I use it no one can tell that I'm using a headset. My only complaints are that it did not appear new when I got it - the rubber covering on the headset was starting to come off and the metal underneath was rusty - and it's also somewhat uncomfortable to have in the ear. Overall, for the price, the sound quality is great and I would recommend this product to someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money and doesn't mind the mild discomfort."
3,Not a good product,"I received this very quickly, but the product itself is not very good. There is a lot of static and at times, an echo can be heard."
4,Nice microphone,Works great I hear well and the other side hear me well. I remove one star because mine came without the clip on the cord. Luckily the microphone is good enough so there is no sound pickup problem.I also bought a 2.5mm to 3.5 mm converter so I can use this as a headset to my computer. Very nice to only have to carry one headset and a tiny one.For the price this is an unbelievable good headset.
1,Waste of money and your precious time!,"Do not buy this product. Voice volume of the headset was so low and muffled that nobody can hear me. And the seller will not reimburse shipping, which means refund will be only A CENT! Only after I received it I realized that is the way they prevent return and refund of their poor products. They make money on the 5 bucks so-called shipping fee!"
3,Not Compatible with All 2.5 mm phones,"While I can hear clearly with this headset and listen to music, no one on the other end can hear me speaking to them. I'm disappointed since the description states it is compatible with all 2.5 mm phones. I have a Huawei Ascend cell, and it's hard to find headsets that work with these phones.I'll keep these as a spare to listen to music, but I'll just foot the $15 for the correct headset for my phone."
2,don't talk without one,The first one of the two I ordered was OK but a few people said that my voice came through very soft. The mic on the second one came apart on the second use and is not usable.
4,Simple and effective,"I bought this for a Kyocera Jax phone with no bluetooth and a 2.5mm plug. I had tried buying a similar headset at a big-box store but it had a 3.5mm plug with a step-down adapter to 2.5mm despite saying the opposite on the cover. This one came as advertised as a 2.5mm for a low price that included shipping (cheaper than just driving to the nearest store). It arrived about 3 days after I ordered it and about a week ahead of the expected time.Pros: light, clear sound, mic works well, long enough cord, comfortable earpiece.Cons: no button for answering / hanging upOverall a nice headset if you need something simple and effective."
5,What a BARGAIN!,"Great price for a simple, easy to use device for hands-free cell phone use. Also great for those that believe that having your cell phone pressed up against your head is NOT a good idea. Great clarity & sound. Clear as a bell. Definitely worth the $2-3."
1,Doesn't work with the Droid Pro,"I bought this to use with my Droid Pro and it doesn't fit. The ear bud falls right out of the phone. It's too inexpensive to return, so it will go into the endless pile of useless electronics accessories."
3,Arrived quickly,Product arrived quickly and is new but for some reason didn't work well with my phone. It may not be the product though.
5,Excellent device!,"I have been quite impressed by the audio clarity of this Motorola hands-free headset. For all the talk about bluetooth headsets, none comes close to this when it comes to voice clarity, sending or receiving.Also, the ear bud makes it a comfortable wear.This device is like a Toyota Camry. It does the job to perfection. You couldn't ask for anything more reliable."
1,Motorola?,"If you buy this from this seller please note that the item I received was not Motorola but another brand which upon emailing an inquiry to the seller was assured it was identical.The function is OK and equal to one I purchased at the 99 Cent Store the next week for 99 cents to compare.In my opinion, since not Motorola and not any better than a cheap one, buy the cheap one and save the money."
4,Comfortable and Clear - Speaking or Listening...For X2,"I don't need to say much besides my review title. Unlike a lot of people, my use for this thing is for X2 (XBOX 360). It's absolutely perfect for XLIVE gaming. Simply plug it into the ear, then the control and THAT'S IT. I highly recommend it over those ridiculously over-priced and crappy Microsoft brand headsets. ANYONE who plays over XLIVE knows that they suck...massively. The worst thing about this ear piece, is the durability. Their much too delicate.I'm done here so I'm gonna conclude with this: Buy it and just be gentle with it. Don't let it tangle, get pulled and put it away (when not in use) in a moderately safe spot."
2,Poor microphone quality,When using this headset your voice sounds low and muffled on the other side. Seems to be like a poor microphone quality.
2,Not too great,"While the headset works, the earpiece does not stay in well. I bought a similar headseat with longer rubber earpiece for the same price. Perhaps it's just my ear shape, but I'd say go with another model..."
1,not motorola oem,This was bought from BTO. It's not Motorola as described. There is a lot of static noise which pretty much renders it unusable. It's a waste of money.
3,*,good temporary fix since the device works fairly decent overall. The ear piece is a bit large for smaller folks so it's not the most comfortable.
2,Disappointing,"It was sad to see how the brats and wanna-be hippies destroyed the Deadhead scene. I think Jerry died of a broken heart seeing what these selfish gen X'ers did to his ""family"". Our family."
2,Disappointed,"I thought this was going to be more of a ""chat with the band *AND* fans"" kinda thing, but it's mostly just film of the parking lot parties before the Dead shows. I came to the Dead late (about 2002) as a fan, so maybe I just don't get it (and I'm completely anti-drug). It could be that this film is just for those who actually were there and this is like a filmed class reunion."
1,"If you absolutely have to 'relive' the 1995 lot scene, or wonder what it looked like...","This video may be worth renting, once. I saw shows on the 1995 summer tour, and it was just sad. Their were very few positive things happening, and SO MANY bad things happening. If you REALLY need to see that, watch this video. (If you're looking for Band Shots/Concert Footage - don't bother.) Don't expect much in the way of cinematography. This is NOT a high-quality Montery Video release. This is someone who had alot of parking lot video cam footage cashing in on it."
1,over an hour of rambling hippies,I found this dvd a total waste and I'm a fan. Aimless interviews with deadheads talking about their travels with the dead.No music clips.It seems the point was to pick the weirdest looking and least articulate fans and hear their words of wisdom. I was bored after about 5 minutes. Save your money.
1,this book doesn't deserve 1 star by jordan,"This book when i picked it up and looked at the cover the wax paintings looked good. This book shows not to judge a book by it's cover.This author tried to be funny, but the ideas were everything but funny. This guy also tried to make The Pied Piper a better story And yet he made it stupider."
5,An Old South culture that has long vanished,"If you are interested in gunning or fishing, you'll love this book. But even if you aren't, read it anyway for the most richly evocative prose imaginable concerning the late days of the old rural South. For better or worse, this world is gone and will never return, but something of its flavor can be had in this book."
4,The Big Book of Humorous Training Games,This is a good book in where the humor combined with the training technics help the consultant work many curriculums more easy and with more effectiveness.
3,A okay book,"After reviewing this book, it was very helpful in doing physical activities for groups when discussing training activities. There are not many worksheets to help drive home the point, if you were looking for something for a group to do and discuss. These activities are more discussion after some form of activity. These can be fun. The book does have great insight in the begining about discussing being aware of participants needs, physicality, and outright safety when doing these activities. Overall is okay if you want to through some different ideas into the mix of your workshops."
1,Serious pain for a brighter smile,"I received the peach flavored trays as a gift from my orthodontist after getting my braces off, so price really wasn't a concern. The directions that came with them said ""Wear for 60 minutes per day""(the instructions didn't mention a 30 minute option). I made it 55 minutes before I was jumping up and down, clawing at the trays to get them out. I had horrible, sharp ""zings"" that felt like the dentist had drilled through a nerve in all the teeth across the front of my mouth-top and bottom. Five hours later, I'm still having them constantly and have been drooling a lot! I read online that flouride rinses help with the pain, so have tried that. Neither that nor ibuprofen have lightened it up at all. I'm sure the pain will probably go away within the next day or so, but my creamy-colored teeth are not worth all this."
3,Kinda hard to get the technique down...,"I'm currently trying out some samples of this product my dentist's assistant gave me. I have just started using it, so I'm not sure if it will be effective, but my main problem with it is that it's hard to put in. You have to push the rubber device in and slide the outside off, keeping the inside in. This is tricky, and I've failed to do it properly the three times I've tried it now, opting to push it on with my fingers instead because the tray doesn't separate from the inside adhesive stuff."
5,better than other over the counter products,"I was given this as a gift by a dentist friend. I don't mind that the gel comes over the edge a little. It doesn't burn my mouth at all. The gel coating is a little gross when you go to rinse your teeth at the end but I am glad that the product thoroughly covers my smile. After one application I noticed a difference in the color of my teeth. I still haven't finished the supply but wanted to write a review since the other review is so negative. I am going to buy some for my sister. Compared to other strips etc., I thought this was easy to use and liked the immediate results."
4,Excellent,"Earl Greyhound are one of the new bands from NYC who are making some noise. They are not a band rehashing the same old new wave influences. They are a hard rock trio with male/female vocals. They are more inspired by the hard rock of the 1970s. It's sexy music. It makes no apologies. ""Fashion"" is almost as hard rocking as Cream. Earl Greyhound would at the end of the day seem like another good time band like Young Heart Attack. It is excited music to hear. It's four songs, but it's enough to make me what to stick around. I saw them play recently with Soundtrack of Our Lives, and they got a positive reaction."
4,Essential reading for the Falklands and Gulf wars,"This is one of the most readable personal accounts of the Falkland and Gulf wars that I have encountered.Chris Craig commanded the frigate HMS Alacrity during the Falkalnds war. Alacrity was in the thick of action - searching for blockage runners (sinking one), was near-missed by an Argentine submarine, and carried out many fire support missions. Naval operations during the Gulf war have been overshadowed by the land campaign, even though it is unlikely that Desert Storm would have been possible without command of the sea. This book partly redresses that inbalance. Craig commanded the royal navy squadron during the conflict and this book provides much insight into naval operations."
1,Utterly Bad,"Clive Barker is a terrible writer. For some unknown reason, I've read several of his books over the years, most likely because they're sold at the airport bookstore, and I need something new to read on a long flight. His books are uniformly badly written, with plots that go nowhere, and full of ridiculous metaphors (the sun rose like a stripper...) and bizarre sex (invariably, someone is aroused by killing someone/being killed/seeing a monster/being a monster/etc). I personally don't understand how his books even get published, let alone sell, and THEN also get turned into movies! How does this happen? Fight the insanity, and just say no to Clive Barker."
5,why haven't you already read this book?,"Early Barker, stunning, beautiful, horrifying, terrifying, heartbreaking. All the things we love Clive for. If you haven't already read this book, why the heck not? If you have, read it again. And again."
4,exceptional horror stories,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. For me, Barker knows how to use just enough detail to keep the story interesting, while still giving the reader a sense of the disorientation of the characters. Sure, it's not great literature. But it's entertaining, and quite good as horror writing goes. I'd compare it more to the works of Poe and Lovecraft than King and more recent authors."
4,Thoroughly enjoyed,"A nice book for a scary escape for a little while. Loved the idea of the story, and the ""villian"" was awesome, and could have been expanded on. It is also a fairly short story, with some other short stories added that are pretty good. Ejoyed it, but this is one of the few times I enjoyed the movie better than the book."
1,Do not recommend this item.,Item arrived and looked nothing like the picture. The items were in a tin and not in a basket like in the picture. Very disappointed in this purchase! Would not recommend at all.
2,Unsatisfactory,"The item arrived on time, as described, and in good condition. However, there was NO greeting card with the product. This had been defined at the time of order. There was nothing of this nature: on the outside of the delivery box; on the inside of the delivery box; on the outside of the delivered basket; on the inside of the delivered basket.The recipient did not know who sent the gift until I called two days after delivery info was posted. We went over the package in detail to confirm the lack of any kind of greeting card."
2,too much repetition,"the author does write well, but it gets kinda tiring when huge sections are repeated over and over. for example, an incident is described. then, described again -- almost word for word -- during the investigation chapters. then again -- again, word for word -- during the testimony chapters. obviously, the initial description was taken from the court transcripts. i don't see the need to go verbatem again during the testimony chapters. makes reading the book quite tedious. i was skipping pages at a time because it was stuff i'd read earlier -- twice or more before.however, this is a scary story and keeps you on alert for sweet-talkers."
5,Easy to read,book was very easy to read. could not put the book down. very well written. i would recommend this book to all
1,Tedious,This book was extremely boring. The writers style was monotonous and I didnt get a feel for the characters. I had to skip sections as I couldnt persevere. I do not recommend this book
5,So So WORTH IT- AWESOME DVD,"January 30, 2013 By JacobBrandyDoggyNo regrets at all. Great price also. Very Very HIGH QUALITY. I also love the artwork that it has. 4 discs if you include part two. Thank you. I love it. Awesome buy. If I could give a 6 STAR review, I would, but there are only 5 stars.I HIGHLY recommend this DVD."
5,Great Series,I'm not a fan of the show but my 6 year old started watching it on NetFlix and she loves this show!
4,This is definitely worth looking at,A useful and crisp description of Alaska by an inveterate traveler. Scott has a good grasp of the art of writing clear and readable prose. A good view of the Idiatrod race and a cursory history of Alaska as well.
5,very fun read,"A great read for anyone who romanticizes the great white north, or at least wants to know what its like. I was captivate by the crisp clear prose and was swept up in the adventure."
5,Reef tank,Does everything I need it to do. I also dose with purple up so calcium levels are not as much of a concern.
5,Great product no issues,Great price and I've been using this product for 2 years now and haven't had an issue with it yet.
2,Makes water cloudy,Used this salt solution to hatch brine shrimp. Did not work and made the water very cloudy. took a few hours for the dust to settle.
5,fantastic company to deal with,"was not happy with purchase, had an emediate responce from seller, easy return and prompt refund offered, A+ seller"
4,good guide,"Somewhat outdated, but a good book to have around for reference.A fairly complete and large selection of plants, animals,and different foods used by different birds and mammals.Also included is information on marsh and water related plants and birds."
1,Not A Very Strong Read!,"This book had great potential but I feel that it fell a little short. This may be due to the fact that this book only totals 192 pages and most of these are filled with sexual activity. I have no problem with erotic stories but I do like to have a ""storyline"" between the two characters that are supposed to be ""finding"" love.Bridge and Fallon have great potential but the storyline is very thin and not well fleshed out so their romantic encounters although HOT left we at times feeling rather cold. If there was any emotional growth between the two I missed it.There are plenty of good erotic reads out there that offer not only steamy love scenes between the characters but storylines as well. If you are in the market for love scene after love scene with little emotional depth of storyline than this is the story for you. If on the other hand you need more than this look elsewhere.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"
1,Too bad it's not accurate,"Two very big problems with this computer are accuracy and settings. My wheel circumfrance is 2038mm. Using that circumfrence setting, according to the instructions I compared the GT Computer to my GPS. The result....at exactly two miles by the GPS the GT indicated 3.38 miles. Of course the indicated speed was off (high) as well. I might have been able to eventually calibrate the computer using the GPS except for an even more frustrating problem. Whenever you attempt to reset the wheel circumfrance it automatically defaults to 2124. So you can never recheck the number you set to confirm that you set it correctly and if/when you do correctly calibrate the computer you must write down the number in case you ever need to reset. Also, all other settings (such as clock) go to default settings. So you must reset everything anytime you change any setting. However, the clock is accurate! The only thing I really like about this computer is the mount."
1,SCAM,"This bracelet broke into two pieces. When I took it to a jeweler, he said it was junk. The silver metal is junk metal, not sterling. The 24k gold covering was brass. So now I have a junk, broken bracelet. Please do not waste your money on this item like I did!!!"
1,bad business,I ordered this item. After a long wait. I was informed that the item was not available for sale. Bad Business
3,Nina's Not My Cup of Tea,"Not one of Trollope's best (although he thought it was pretty good).. He apparently tried to disguise his authorship of it, but the critics soon recognized it as Trolloope's work."
5,Excellent book!,"This book is funny and realistic. It's about a girl, Carrie who works for the newspaper. A cute older guy, Chip, asks her to do a secret column, ""Dear Lovey Hart"", where she answers questions that the readers write in. It starts out fun, she gets tons of letters, helps epople out with serious issues, and gets closer to Chip. Only Carrie's best friend, Claudia also has thing for Chip. Carrie's other best friend, Terry has a thing for a teacher, which leaves her in depression after embarassment and rejection. Marty, Carrie's older guy friend, who's Chip's age, has a crush on Carrie. He wrties to Lovey Hart, asking for information, but when Carrie gives him info, everything goes wrong. Jen, Carrie's little sister soon finds out that Carrie is Lovey Hart. The book countineus and is really exciting and interesting. I strongly reccomend it!"
1,Product not as advertised,"I ordered this DVD based on the description and the product photo. In the photo of the cover of the DVD it says it includes a Bonus Side with How to play Hard Rock, this was not on my dvd. Guitar world has the same product and description, and its describes a two sided DVD, mine was not. Not sure if this is a copy but certainly not an Original Guitar world DVD"
3,"The Penguin Guide is a fun read, but not much more","I've loved reading through the Penguin Guide over the years, and I recently picked up this version at a used book store. I still enjoy reading them, but like others have said, it's not quite the same. Also, you can't always believe their recomendations are a sure winner. For example, I love collecting Boyce's Eight Symphonies, and I recently bought Naxos' (2005) version with the Aradia Ensemble, and it was a wonderful recording and far more enjoyable than Trevor Pinnock's version. But, the Penguin Guide (2006/07) gave the Naxos recording just one star, but Pinnock's got three stars. I couldn't agree less!!!So, it is a fun read and you can find some great recordings through the Penguin Guide, but other times they'll recommend turds. If you are looking for music references, the best thing to do is use many different music guides (Amazon, Gramophone, Third Ear, etc.) and not just the Penguin Guide."
2,Predictable and boring,"Why waste your time and money? Based on this book's standards, just buy anything by a British artist or on a British label and you are sure to have a complete three-star CD collection. What source are you left with? Listen to a lot of versions of a given work(for example in public libraries)and decide what kind of approach you like. You might find out that your tastes are not those of elder conservative British gentlemen."
5,A must have for a pottery collector's library!,"As an avid pottery collector, I have an ever growing collection of Pottery Collector's Guides. Abingdon Pottery Artware is one I refer to over and over again. Clear pictures of marks, stamps, labels and bottoms and an extensive price guide organized by mold number and alphabetized by mold type making identification a snap. This guide is filled with color pictures that I have found to be true to life glaze colors, each picture also includes mold numbers and production dates. One of my top 3 favorite collector's guides!"
3,MUCH bigger than I anticipated,"I know, you'll say ""Well don't you know what an inch is?"" Of course, but jesus! This thing is huge. Way too big for a simple keychain. It's been relegated to my car's glove box. I should have bought the smaller one."
5,Swiss army knife victorinox,The Victorinox Swiss Army Knife has all the tools that I would ever want.It is not too big to fit into my pocket and I believe the knife is strong enough to stand up under continued use.
5,Fabulous tool and fabulous price,"I have little to add to the other 5 star reviews except I am really lucky to obtain this delightful tool at this price. I wanted to buy this knife 25 years ago when it was $80 in 1980 dollars.Light weight, high quality, this is a bargain and I use it for some task every day."
5,awesome knife!,"This knife is awesome! The 21 tools are all very useful. It is always my first choice whenever I need a knife. Though I'm not really sure that people would use a grocery bag carrier, but it's still pretty useful. Get this knife, It gets the job done!"
5,Nifty Gifty,"Ignore the part of the title that says, ""Gifty."" I didn't use it as a gift. It was simply too ""Nifty"" so I just kept it.This is a sweet multitool! Swiss really packed some great tools into this set (which I'm not going to reiterate, you can read them from the description). Whichever service you intend for this product, the Champion Plus has a tool that will work. However I misunderstand why the Plus version is minus pliers from the regular Champion.But overall a very versatile gadget."
3,Missing tools,"This product is nice. However, after hours of munipulation, it is missing four tools. They are wire cutters, wrench, pliers and the steel pin. The brochure says it is the champ and has the picture of those tools. The website says the tools are included. They are not. I bought this as a gift for someone going into the Peace Corp. Those items would have been great. I and the recipient ar disappointed."
3,not completely what I ordered,"Very nice knife, and really good price but be aware! Picture is not what you are gettng! Pliars are not included in this knife like shown in the picture which was one reason why I was buying this. Kind of disappointing, but for the price it was still worth it. Just to bad sellers are liars."
3,Review for swiss army knife,The knife was up to all I thought it should be except the fact there was no wire cutters in the knife.This is my 5th knife I have owned and I would like to have a wire cutter in my next one please.
4,Very Handy,"A bit bulky to carry around in your pocket, but it has lots of tools if / when you need them."
2,Husband hated it,I had gotten it for my husband but it was a big mistake. He is used to leathermans and apparently these don't really lock. I remembered my Grandfather using them for a long time but then I remembered that was something he didn't like either. I would return it but then I would loose 45% of what I had paid for it so I will just keep it in the stuff draw in the kitchen..
2,INCREASE IN 200 %,"In January 7 Costs 30 dollars today costs 70 to $ 100, what happened? THIS PRICE LOSE INTEREST in this ARTICLE"
3,Swiss Army Champion Plus,Very heavy. Hard to open and figure out. But it's got everything you would ever need. They need to get rid of them cork screws!! Who ever uses them anyways!
2,Victorinox,I go for the price of this one and actually gor 3 more to give as gifts which is a hit among teens.
1,pix showed different product,I returned the item because the web pix showed a built in pliers and the item received did not have it. The pix above is not the one that you had posted when I ordered.In any case I was happy with the return treatment and it gies me confidence in future purchases.
1,Honest Review. VERY IMPORTANT**,"i dont mean to go against all swiss army knives or anything but a couple of years ago i got a Victorinox knife and it was the biggest piece of crap i had ever owned. Literally 1 hour after i opened it, WITHOUT using it, the crappy plastic outer shell came off. it was being held together by extremely weak glue. I got a wenger later on and it worked PERFECTLY. so much better it was absurd. If you want a great reccomendation, go with a solid steel gerber knife. I got a gerber Winchester knife and it lasted me for three years. it was like 8 bucks i got at walmart. a victorinox costs like at least 20 and lasts 1 day??? i think not. like i said... go with a solid steel real folding knife, NOT SWISS, and make sure that it has a steel handle. If the blade wobbles, tighten it. Its that simple. But the way Victorinox makes it's knives... I will never buy one again."
1,Big disappointment,"I selected this item because it was to be delivered with a second, smaller, pocket knife. The second knife was not delivered."
4,Pretty Good,"This knife is great, my only complaint is that it should have a pair of pliers to be complete. The saw is the best, and all the pieces are very sharp."
4,Same high quality Victorinox product,"This is a great knife. I had used the Explorer model which is a little thinner for maybe 20 years or so, but it was no longer available, so I tried this one. This model works just as well as that one. I especially like the file. Works really well on fingernails & should work well on plastics and fine grained woods. The other tools, screwdrivers, small ruler are usable as well, but I haven't used them very much to date.I use the knife several times a day."
5,Swiss Army Knife,"I both this item and my husband loves it. He has 3 Swiss Army Knives already, but this one has options that weren't available in the other models. Great price through Amazon! Thanks."
5,Great Buy!,Product received was exactly what was described. Fast and prompt service. Delivered in factory seal. Gift was a big hit!
4,Impressive,"I honestly thought my parents wouldn't get this knife for me. Dad, suprisingly, said no. My Mother, much to my luck and suprise, wanted one since she was 4 1/2 (go figure). She bought two of these quality knives online. The bad part about them (4 stars reason) was that with regular order, it took about a week for them to arrive. And that's the bad news over. The good news is that this knife is good for just about everything. It is sturdy, very handy in a tight spot, and can help you solve just about everything. True stry: I'm in class about to take a test and my pencil isn't sharpened. This knife is in my pocket. It takes about 5 seconds under my desk for the pencil to be perfectly sharpened =). It is a bit heavy, but this is nly a minor setback. Recommended? Definately."
3,Swiss Army Knife,"Given as gifts to sons, both say they are excellent, better than the old ones they had years ago. But, there are way too many of these to choose from and no list of what is included. I had to find it on their website in order to type out list of what tools are in it. I gave it a three because of this reason and because it's very hard to pull the tools out, at least it is for me on the one I have."
5,Swiss Champ Plus,"As with all Victorinox knives the fit and finish is perfect. The pliers are the only tool this knife does not have ,comparing it to the Swiss Champion. This knife is less than half the cost of the Swiss Champion,which makes it a great tool at a very good price point. This tool makes a really great gift."
5,"Best gift...my brother loves it...and my dad, too","I bought this knife for my brother. He loves it so much. He finds countless ways to use it. He carries it with him all the time. I think it's heavy...but my brother doesn't mind. My dad saw it, and I know I need another one for him, too. I guess it one of guys' favorite toy."
5,perfect,It's the real mccoy! If you can't find a use for everything here you don't need to have one! They are everything they say and built with precision and quality.
5,Awesomely useful!,"Great for everything!Very Handy, what i like the most is that this knife is also, beautiful, it feels right, a great gift for men."
1,Scratch surfaces,"Disappointed with product as surface was scratched upon receipt. Even though this is a warehouse sale item, it will be good to highlight actual product condition to consumer for more informed decision prior purchase. Hope Amazon Warehouse will improve on consumer communication."
3,Nice but a bit hard to open,"As you can guess, this knife is very handy when you either dont want to stop and looke for tools or you dont have any around but need to get someting doen. It is very good quality, you get more value than you pay for. Excellent to carry with you or have in your car for emergencies. I like to camp and hike. I go as often as I can and every time I go I really need to carry my Swiss Army knife with me since I seem to need it regularly.I thought I would never use every tool on this knife and so far I have not but I have used most of them."
5,beutifull knife,It's a great pocket knife. Excellent quality. Very tough. but do not understand why not in the official catalog of Victorinox 2011? could someone answer my question?
5,Ultimate Knife,"I've taken this knife on two camping trips so far and it has proven to be an necessary tool. This is replacing a ""Camper"" model (Thanks TSA!). I probably would have upgraded to this model anyway.Tools I have used: The saw, it really rips through branches, the file, both blades, the can opener, corkscrew, scissors, the ""hook thingy"" (handy for carrying bundles of firewood), and the Phillips screwdriver. I anticipate using all the features eventually. This knife has earned a permanent home in my car. Much like the old credit card ads: ""Don't leave home without it!""It's size allows for pocket carrying, barely. I wouldn't want to carry it all day every day, but when I need to carry it, it can be in my pants pocket comfortably.I have been a life long user of Victorinox knives and highly recommend this for anyone considering it. Buy it, you can't go wrong!"
5,Perfect gift,I was so excited when my 14 year old little sister asked for a swiss army knife for christmas that I knew I needed to get the perfect one. After going over the different options I decided that although this knife has a few extra features that she will never use it has everything I would require from a do everything knife.She was excitedly discovering hidden tools all night after we exchanged gifts at midnight. Couldn't have asked for a better reaction.
4,Great overall product,"This is a great overall product. The only thing is, it is a little bulky for putting in your pocket all the time. Not the products fault, but mine for not thinking about the overall size."
5,Many uses...,"This is my favorite Swiss army knife because it has a bit more than most other knifes. I like most of the tools, but I could have done without the fish descaler and the hook. The saw is perfect for camping, for many uses. And you also have all the handy gadgets you like on a knife: different screwdrivers, scissors, nail file, tweezers, toothpick and punch as well as your basic, essential knife blades. I've had one of these for many years, and have used it all over the world.Remember to carry a sharpening tool with you as well as the blades need frequent re-sharpening to be in top shape.I found a great solution to cleaning the lint/ food that gets lodged in the grooves of the handle. I simply throw it in one of those ultrasonic jewelry cleaners that you can get on amazon for around 20 bucks and it keeps on shining like new! Overall worth way more than you pay for it!"
5,It's got everrrything,"I bought this knife to be a supplement to my CERT bag in case of emergencies. It has more than I expected and is a great knife. With a file that can also cut metal and bolts and a REALLY sharp saw it is very practical in an emergency. I have it sitting where I can get to it easily now, because it is such a great knife. I probably won't put it in my pocket very often, but I wasn't planning on that anyway."
4,Gadget overload,"I bought this knife, thinking it was a replacement for a SMALL keychain Swiss Army knife I had that was getting ""yukky"" and old, so I was surprised that I had ordered a pocket-size knife when it arrived- my fault. Forgetting the size mistake, there are really too many gadgets in this one- despite the fact that I love gadgets. They are too hard to pull out individually and you have to pull others out sometimes to get to the one you want. I didn't know it was so hunting/fishing oriented either. I don't know when I'll ever need to use the fish scaler!! My 14 yr old son is drooling for the knife, so I may just give it to him for Christmas and hunt down the small one I wanted in the first place. Great bargain though at $19."
5,"Excellent, Purposeful Knife","The Swiss knife lived up to all my expectations. Great product, sturdily constructed and a good fit for the case that I already owned from my last knife."
4,Great for the Price,"I had one of these knives for years and then lost it (I think it was stolen). The knife has a ton of useful tools and is very well made. The only thing I miss from the first one I had was it came with a case, this one does not. But considering that I paid 3X the price I did for the new one I can live with out a case.If you are going to buy a knife, Victorinox is the way to go!!!!!"
5,"for the price , your getting a lot ! one of my favs","Other then the pliers compared to the Swiss Champ . Its lighter and has a ton of tools . Perfect for camping or your glove box in the car . I love the little screw driver for glasses or tiny screws that fits in the cork screw opener .magnifiying glass has great clarity . The saw will cut through almost anything , metal file. And the large and small blade are great for open boxes carving wood or limbs for hot dog sticks or making wood traps ,snares etc etc. All the tools u need here and its not too heavy or bulky like the classic Swiss champ. A plus. Even a pen to leave emergency notes or if you have no pen just to jot notes and so on . The needle is handy for splinter removal. Get it"
5,Worth it!,Like the rest of my Swiss Army Knives ( Victorinox ) this baby is worth it's own weight in gold. I once saw Macgyver build an airplane with one :)
5,i like this knife,"this knife has so many useful tools that i can catch it without any other tools at all when i is outside~so it's a very good gift to my friend, he like it very much too~"
5,Great knife,"I am really impressed with this knife. I've never owned a Swiss knife before so I was not sure what to expect. Sure enough it's Swiss made and not made in China. The magnifying glass is very clear and very strong. The scissors are great too, they cut paper very well. The smallest flat head screwdriver stored in the cork screw works great for eyeglasses. Everything seems exceptionally well made, very sturdy and strong. This knife has a great file that looks like it will really file down metal if needed. Also a great looking wood saw that looks like it will really saw wood. So dont be afraid to buy these Swiss made knifes. I'm probably going to buy another one."
4,Quality product.,This product is the perfect size and mix of tools for everyday use. The size it not too big while providing a nice range of tools. The blades are sharp out of the box. I wish the magnifier was mounted in metal instead of being all plastic (less chance of breaking). This knife replaced a Mountaineer. This knife has almost 2x the number of tools but is not much wider than the previous one that it is still comfortable for everyday carry in a pocket.
4,"Not the ""Swiss Champ"" knife but close!","I was surprised too see that it does not have pliers (very useful) like my 20+ year old ""Victorinox Swiss Champ"".Name of product is very similar to the next model up.Surprised they call it a""plus"" when it is really ""minus"" a feature!Price was great though.JS."
5,great,this is a great knife. So many functions. Gave it as a present and my son loved it. Big smiles. This is a Big knife.
4,", on time delivery, looks good,","this is basically a all-in-one tool, I just bought it to fullfill one of my old dreams, but speak the truth, I doubt I would never use some of them in my whole life time, but it is tool, and price 29.99 is worthy.if is a little bit thick and heavy for me, since it got some many items on it."
5,Pocket toolbox,"I have always bought the Tinker, but thought I would step up to the Champion. I use this pocket toolbox every single day. From opening packages, using the magnifying class to examine jewelers marks or the little screwdriver on the corkscrew for eyeglass screws every implement on this knife has been used, even the hook for carrying bags! The only implement I have used with less than success is the corkscrew: after trying it I went back to the lever corkscrew as I can see spitting teeth as a result of using it. Lifetime warranty, the Victorinex brand and the overall quality of this implement makes it handy for just about every one's pocket, purse, tackle box or desk drawer.In the day of planned obsolescence and shoddy mass produced items these pocket knives stand out for their high quality and low price tags. Compare similar pocket tool kits and the difference in materials and quality will rapidly convince you that Victorinex is the real deal."
5,Good Quality Swiss Army Knife,Got this on sale. Very much worth the price. Very useful and good quality. Arrived quickly and is good value
5,best knife ever,"I've had one of these for over 20 years, and the scissors just broke so I got a new one, they are still awesome, not to big not to small, just right"
5,One of my favorite records!,"This is a great record. Each of the musicians does justice to Vic's music while at the same time expressing their own style. Even though he's not well-known, Vic Chesnutt is highly respected in the music world, which is why musicians like R.E.M., Madonna, and Live wanted to cover his songs. Kristin Hersh does an absolutely beautiful version of ""Panic Pure"" on this record- as good as Vic's, which makes me suspect that she's actually his female counterpart. R.E.M. said it all in their comment, ""Vic is cherry pie."" If you want to get a Vic album after hearing this, I recommend ""Drunk"" or ""West of Rome."""
4,Sweet Relief II - love this CD,"Had bought this CD years ago, and it disappeared. After replacing it, I realized how much I loved it. Thanks for the great service and shipping it quickly..."
4,Madonna and Joe Henry make the album worth the money!,I had never heard of Vic Chestnutt before this cd. I stumbled upon this cd looking for Madonna material. I bought it and played it over and over(the one track) and loved it. Then I decided to play the rest of it. Garabage's cover is really awesome. Then the rest of the album blew me away. What a great song writer and terrific cd. Every cd collector should have this one
5,"Thank you, Teldec!","A superb release! The premiere recordings of Atmospheres, Lontano and SF Polyphony from the 1960s on Wergo are essential listening for any Ligeti fan, and Claudio Abbado's Vienna Philharmonic DG recordings (Atmospheres and Lontano) are impressive. But with gorgeous orchestral playing and sumptuous recording quality, Teldec has done Ligeti proud. Apparitions, receiving its first recording, remains a fascinating, frustrating piece. I heard this piece years ago on the radio, and at a concert, so I can't say that unfamiliarity is the problem. It seems the least loved of Ligeti's early works.But it's great to have it on CD at last to try to unravel its mysteries.Teldec, thank you! Sony's decision to scrap Salonen's splendid Ligeti cycle halfway through was a bitter disappointment. Teldec's decision to take over deserves a HUGE round of applause. And lots of CD sales."
1,"no ability to download on Android, PC, or Mac.","My son loves Caillou and I wanted the ability to watch it on my Android tablet without being connected to wifi. Amazon only allows the ability to download to the Kindle tabs, iphone, and itouch."
5,very entertaining,My granddaughter loves this series. Very educational and fun!! She can't get enough. Very good ethics and life rules. Awesome
4,caillou is great,"Caillou is great, kept my 4 year old grandson entertain non-stop till it was over.I didn't know he had that good of an attention span."
5,Can't live without it!,My 2 year old is obsessed with Calliou and has certain favorite episodes... this collection has all her favorites. Keeps her occupied while mommy needs to get something done!
1,Whining lessons,"If you would like to teach your children to whine every question and complaint then by all means buy up all the Caillou you can. I tolerated Barney, Teletubbies and all sorts of talking cartoon animals, and I did so gladly. Never did I endure an entire episode of Caillou. Luckily if it came on after another program my children enjoyed it didn't bother them when I turned it off. I guess they didn't like his whining either."
4,Excellent For Preschoolers,"My 3 year old just loves Caillou! She will sit absorbed for hours at my kitchen table watching on my Kindel Fire HD while I work. She is also getting some great lessons in behavior and values, that a lot of her children's DVD's aren't giving her. It's nice to not have to look over her shoulder to be assured of the safe content of what she is watching,."
1,terrible show,My kids love this show. It is about a whiny 4 year old and the theme song gets stuck in the head. I have banned it in the house.
4,Liked it!,"My girls enjoyed watching this. They are 2 and 5. My only issue is with streaming Amazon, I wish it was a bit more user friendly."
5,My kid loves this.,My kid loves this. The quality it streams through my Roku 2 XS is very nice. More seasonal episodes need to me added in Amazon.
4,My 2 grandchildren are hooked,"My 2 grandchildren are hooked, Caillou all day long. Morning afternoon night time. He is so sweet and helps children learn how to behave"
1,DOESN'T PLAY,"The reason I hate it is because the video won't load right or stops while the movie is playing, my grandson gets irritated with it. If I thought I could return it I would... REALLY TRULY HATE IT."
3,Could do without the puppets,"When the videos show actual Caillou episodes, it is great. However, in the later episodes the show becomes dominated by clips with cheesy puppets and other such stuff. Maybe other kids like to watch that fluff, but my toddler wants to watch the cartoons - not the other stuff. 5 stars for the cartoons. 1 star for the cheap filler.For those who complain about him being whiny, he seems to be a lot less whiney than most 4 year-olds I know. I don't really see any bad examples set by Caillou in the episodes."
4,Love it.,My three-year-old loves Caillou. Please create VOD APP for android! I'm able to watch this on my HTC EVO by Googling the full Amazon site.
5,"Nice set of Videos, Has Fireman, No Puppets, No whining!","Purchased this for my two little Caillou fans. My son loves firemen and this episode has Caillou as a fireman. Both my kids like these episodes. There is nothing scary, no puppets and caillou isn't whining like in some of the older episodes."
1,Whiny.,"Oh how I hate Caillou.How much of a selfish, whiny brat can one take? Why do his parents love him? Why are all the colors primary in his world?This show would be great if the people who wrote the first season of Battlestar: Gallactica wrote it.Spoiler: they didn't.If you want your kids to be whiny jerks with no self control or awareness, let them watch this."
1,bad example,"I never write any reviews but have to write this one. Caillou is a whiner, complainer, and has bad manners. My daughter started talking like him and thank goodness we banned this show"
3,My kids love this hoser...,It's nice to get a wholesome show from our friends north of the border but this kid is a total hoser. Having said that my kids love the it.
4,wonderful,"greta learnign show for our 2 year old daughter I'd recommend this, especially when Elmo and barney get VERY tiersome."
5,Great series!,My 2.5 yr old daughter loves Caillou. I'm so happy we were able to find this season since the it can be a little difficult to watch the episodes on tv.
5,love it,It's always fresh and fun...my grandchildren love it and can watch it by the hour. It's great for kids from 1 yr. old on up!
2,Hard to do,"I didn't give this meal replacement much of a chance. I read the reviews before I bought,but I really thought I could handle it. It's true it's not good tasting. My daughter loves it. I think I will try it again and add fruit this time. I will let you know how much I like it at that time.Mk"
1,Not orth it,"I lost weight with this product be cause it went through me like crap through a goose. Oh did i mention that it taste like it smells- like rotting and fermenting vegetables. Believe the reviews that talk about the taste. You can even mask it with the stuff they tell you to mix it with. If I had time to mix it with all those other fruits, then I wouldn't even need this stuff! Save your money. To add insult to injur, I requested the free measuring spoon, and they never sent it. Cheapskates!I would definitely NEVER recommend to a friend! I would recommend it if you need a product to add to a practical joke."
2,Taste :(,I'm sure it's the ultimate meal nutritionally but you must be really dedicated because the taste had me gagging. It went right into the trash
2,Great for you.... if you can keep it down!,"I bought the small container to try it out. The ingredients list is impressive and I really enjoy a good, healthy morning shake.I REALLY wanted to like this. With a banana, I could barely keep this down. The taste is THAT BAD. When I was out of bananas, I tried it again and this time I threw up (tmi sorry).When I can keep this down, I feel great afterwards. Like I said, the ingredients list is impressive. I won't be buying this again, however. I cannot justify the price for the torture of trying to drink this. As another person posted, life is too short! And there are great tasting meal replacement shakes out there."
3,NOT FILLING ENOUGH,"This is a great product for its value. It has MORE than enough ni=utrients that our bodies often don't get enough of. However, for the amount of caliries in the product, it needs to be more filling. It's designed as a meal replacement to be consumed with a few pieces of fruit, but it won't hold you over until your next meal, which leads to consuming more calories thanyour body needs. Great product if you don't mind being hungry until your next meal."
1,Unpleasant Meal,"This really must be good for you, because it is really awful tasting. The instructions call for a banana and half an apple (Fuji I believe), which enables one to drink it without gagging. I'm just cheap enough that I was determined to consume the entire amount purchased because it's so expensive. I am truly thankful that I bought the small size."
4,Just the right tool for changing oil on my Toyota truck,"Yes, girls do change oil too.this is the single tool you need in addition to a roll of paper towels (and newspapers to catch any oops).you just turn it over to reverse the direction (on / off) so just learn the right hand rule to make sure you're turning it correctly. All metal, seems strong enough to do the job. It's not as nice as a Snap on tool, but hey, the price is right."
1,Oh My GOD!!!,"Please, if you are looking to throw away your money, send all checks or money orders to me instead!"
2,Doesnt work on concrete oil stains,"Product does not work...even when the stains are soaked and allow to sit.... then power sprayed after and then resoaked, scrubbed and sprayed again. very dissapointed and still have ugly stains in my driveway!"
1,dont waste your money,"after 3 bottles of this product on my driveway it did nothing even after 4 applications just cheap bottle of degreaser did a better job, would like to see proof of any kind this cleaner works on new or old oil spots"
5,The best there is,"I have been using Meguiar's Vinyl/Rubber #40 for 14 years. Why?- Not shiny, phony glossy black.- Tires look new, not shiny, not dull, but nice rich black with a new look.- Doesn't brown or yellow.- Works well on interior dash and darker plastic on console- Doesn't leave an odor.Do not use on rubber/vinyl floor mats or leather seats. You can if you want a semi-glossy look but it leaves the surface too slippery. My local parts store CSK/Kragen doesn't stock it anymore. Good find on Amazon.Cars: Porsche Turbo, Acura CLS, Aston Martin DB9"
3,Not Their Best Product,"I was looking for a replacement for Meguiar's NXT Protectant since they discontinued it and have tried every product they have, including this one, but nothing else they have compares to the NXT Protectant. They never should have discontinued it. The #40 is okay, but it doesn't perform as well as the NXT Protectant...guess I'll have to go to another company's product."
5,Meguiar's #40 Vinyl/Rubber Cleaner 16 oz.,"Meguiar's #40 Vinyl/Rubber Cleaner 16 oz. restores the interior to like new appearence, has pleasent smell, easy to apply by hand......"
3,Time for better translations!,"Cosmos and Pornografia are probably the best, and certainly the most exquisite and profound novels, written by this eminent Polish existentialist. However, it is most regrettable that these exceptional books were translated into English from French and German (Mosbacher and Hamilton)and, as such, have nothing, or almost nothing, in common with the Polish original versions. I hope I am not doing the translators much unjustice by asserting that it is time for new translations by someone who knows Polish and can read and understand Gombrowicz in the original. This is the only way of making it possible for English and American readers to appreciate the genuine, authentic Gombrowicz, still very unknown to the English-speaking world....."
2,"Newer, better translations are now available","I'm a huge fan of Gombrowicz and think that both of these novels are excellent. However, this edition of Cosmos and Pornografia is translated from the French, which is in turn a translation from the original Polish. If something is always lost in translation, this is doubly so in this translation-of-a-translation of Gombrowicz's absurdist masterpieces. The good news is that both of these novels are now available separately in far superior editions translated directly from the Polish by Danuta Borchardt. If you really want a sense of Gombrowicz's endlessly inventive, deeply weird language, as well as the ever-shifting permutations of desire expressed therein, I strongly recommend the Borchardt translations. As for this edition, it served to make Gombrowicz available in English, but thanks to the newer versions translated directly from the original Polish, this one has become obsolete."
4,"Excellent books, but better translations do exist.","I absolutely love Gombrowicz and all his works, with 'Kosmos' and 'Pornografia' being two of my favorites. The translations in this addition are quite good and do a fairly good job conveying Gombrowicz's prose HOWEVER, for a more authentic read I would recommend those editions translated by Danuta Borchardt, for these novels or any of Gombrowicz's work that she touched. Her translations are taken directly from the Polish (as opposed to the Polish to Spanish to English of thse translations) and I feel offer an experience closer to reading his works in the original Polish."
1,"Harry, Please get back to the good stuff!","As a devoted Harry Fan, I bought this the day it was released and could not even listen to all of it. A few songs were tolerable - but Harry, you have developed a following of swing music junkies that don't have grey hair - get rid of this -and please return to music we can dance to!"
4,"Experimental, maybe...but solid","I've bought this fantastic album a few times already, and I hear more with each listen. The tracks are spirited and lively, not just 'genre' music. This album seems to be the opposite-but-equal of 'Blue Light, Red Light'; seemingly more brash, less refined, but with equal amounts of heart and crafty song structure. I recommend this album to anyone. Give it a chance and find your own opinion regarding 'Star Turtle'.Don't miss out on a chance to hear unique and meaty tracks such as ""Nobody Like You to Me"" and ""Eyes of the Seeker."" This is the only Harry album that has that kind of raw honesty."
5,I still remember....,"Ok, the cd came out, originally, when I was 15 years old. My mom purchased it, and while my classmates were reveling in N'sync and Savage Garden and No Doubt... I listened to Star Turtle. And I know what you're thinking...and the answer is no, its not because my mom made me, I selected this CD, I listened on my own, I loved it, independently.Here we are (blah blah blah) and I am almost (gasp) 30! I still love it. Coming today to purchase the mp3 download, as the old tape doesnt work anymore, not that I have a tape player to play it with.I read the reviews and I am saddened a little bit. I don't expect long time HCJ fans to love every single bit of his work, but seems like the die hards are the hardest to please. Give it a chance, it is upbeat; fun; and, while different then the normal crooning, still the voice you love.Thanks for reading."
2,Sometimes Different Isn't Always Good,"I bought this album as a present for my Connick Jr.-loving husband. I thought something new from this prolific composer-performer would be nice, since I've heard the When Harry Met Sally... soundtrack a million times. I let him listen to it alone first, to get the full impact and to be able to analyze every move made. When I asked what he thought, he said, ""Eh..."" Eh. Okay, so I had to listen to it. My reaction? ""Eh..."" It's theoretically and technically strong, as can always be expected. There are interesting chord progressions and the musicians are phenominal. But it's not Harry as you expect him, and I guess I'm hooked on When Harry... I'm all for trying something new, and will continue to do so with Connick Jr., but I love the original works, and think I'll fall back there every time."
5,Just keep coming back to this one,"I have had this CD for many years, and through all of the great new stuff and the fantastic old stuff, I just keep coming back to this one. I rate it as one of the (if not THE) best of Harry's work. There can never be any question of his talent, versatility and passion, as it lives in every note played and sung on anything he has ever recorded. He is more passionate on every subsequent release and this one explodes out with all the noise and power with some funk added in, that we should continue to expect from such a legendary artist."
3,"Harry, Harry, Haaarry!.. Where did this come from??","Granted there were a few songs on the album that I enjoyed: ""Hear me in the Harmony"" , ""Just Like Me"" , ""Boozehound"", and ""City Beneath the Sea."" I'm not sure if the intergalactic turtle was a good idea though. Plus, if ""She"" was a departure from the other stuff and an attempt to get back to his roots, sure he accomplished that; But Star Turtle just went off the deep end and became a whole new change in style. Harry, I love you dearly but you're not a pop artist. I'm sure he was hoping to pick up some new fans with this album, but I don't think their love for him would last very long. If he tries another album in this style, let's hope he leaves space turtles and other weird ideas like this to maybe one song and not try to make a whole CD out of it."
5,He did it again,"Yes, this one is TOTALY different than any other one he's ever made, but that sure doesn't make it bad! I will say that the ""Star Turtle"" songs themselves are a bit much, but the rest of the songs, ""Just Like Me,"" ""City Beneath the Sea,"" ""Never Young...."" Make this one of the Funnest CD's I've ever heard. Perfect for a hot, summer day. I am a huge Harry Connick, Jr fan, and have liked every CD he's put out. And this one is one of the best."
4,Sure it ain't pure jazz or big band...,"I bought this album not having the slightest idea what it was about. I absolutely love Harry, so I figured he couldn't go wrong. At first, I HATED this album. I figured he was just some guy trying to make money by making a rock album. I thought he had sold out.I have since acquired an affinity for funk music. now I LOVE this album. reading the other reviews, it seems obvious that he wasn't trying to sell albums or make what people really liked. He was playing what he wanted to play; and I'm sure he was having a helluva-lotta fun doing it. this is good summer-time music. put it on when you're driving on the freeway with the top-down. or put it on when you're lounging on the beach. Or looking at the stars at night in your shorts.it's good stuff"
3,Average Franco,"""The Devil Came from Akasava"" was made around the same time and with much of the same cast as ""Vampyros Lesbos"" and ""She Killed in Ecstasy"". It's not as psychedelic nor as good as either of those, but it's still a very watchable Franco film. Soledad Miranda is good as usual and the underrated Ewa Strömberg also does a very good job.Those who expect to see a horror movie or a sleazy sexploitation film are likely to be disappointed. This is more of a spy movie. If you take it for what it is it's not bad."
4,This was a very good book,"I really enjoyed this book, it's really a four and a half stars. I had read some of the other Blossom Culp books first, and enjoyed having Alexander as the narrator, although I think I prefer Blossom. I loved the setting. This was a funny, exiting, and somwhat spooky book. I recommend it to pratically anyone."
3,8th grade review,"This book is probably my least favorite out of all the books I've read this year for 8th grade. This story is about a boy named Alexander who finds out that he has a ghost living in his family's barn! After the news gets out all sorts of crazy things start to happen, newspaper reporters, from all over and all sorts of people hes never met come to his house to see the ghost. This book is NOT a horror story or ghost story even though its about a ghost. i would recommend this book to 4-5 grade kids."
4,This book is good,I have read the first chapter. It is about a boy named Alexander and he thinks there is something in his barn. He is to scared to go see what it is in the barn. so he tells his friend to go see. That is all i know about my book.
1,BEWARE! Nothing like the photo or desription!,"Just got this costume today and it looks NOTHING like the photo I relied upon in purchasing it - the mask is tiny, with straps in the back (not desc with no hair (as shown in the photo) and the slits for the eyes are huge and ON TOP OF/OVER the actual eyes of mask. The robe and sash are not the same color depicted in photo and the quality is shotty, at best. Don't buy this. Even worse, is that Amazon says it can only be returned if unopened but you cannot find the deficiencies without opening the package. I am glad I opened it in time to realize this and get a better costume for the price. I even purchased hands and light sabre separately. My son and I are SO disappointed!"
3,Yoda costume,The package was sent the same day I ordered it and arrived a couple of days later. I am very pleased with the product and the turn around time from when ordered and when I received the item.
1,Dangerous!!!,"The formulas in this book contain about 10! (TEN) times the amount of oil that is needed. Infact, at some of the doses Ms Austin has in this book, these recipies are DANGEROUS. Nutmeg.... can cause liver problems! There are 2 formulas that call for 30 drops of Nutmeg. Wintergreen and Cinnamon Bark are very corrosive to the skin. Ms Austin has formulas that call for almost the entire bottle. 1 to 3 drops is all that should be used, NOT the 20 TO 45 DROPS Ms Austin has recogmended.Please, Please be carfull."
1,Aromatic Ignorance,Ms. Austin obviously has no knowledge of the safe usage of essential oil therapy! Many aromatherapist's use this book as an example illustrating disreputable practice when teaching classes on aromatherapy. I would strongly urge potential readers to steer clear of her potentially dangerous recommendations contained within this book.
1,wack-o,"This book was a well-intended gift to me from a fellow relaxing-bath enjoyer. I didn't realize it would contain very subjective material that is actually not at all useful to me. I had a hard time even relating to this book, being from a scientific background though I try to keep an open mind. I would not recommend it to anyone--it seemed to me essentially hocus-pocus."
3,Still state of the art?,"It is now 6 years ago when the last version of this oncesuperb book was released. Meanwhile, bunches of booksaiming a similiar audience were published. Some of them,in particular G.W. Stewarts, are nowadays more seasonable.Notably, the ""iterative"" sections ask for lightrefreshments. The lack of references to appropriatesoftware routines in these parts is another disadvantagewhich could be easily overcome in a new edition."
3,Might be a good reference,but not a good book to learn methods. I guess a book explaining the ideas of main methods in an easy way will help.
5,Wonderful product!,"This sheet fits smoothly, washes beautifully, is extremely durable and comfortable for the patient, and also adapts perfectly to a regular twin bed."
4,good sheet......but,"I have ordered four of these. They are good envelope type hospital bed sheets, but they come with the fitted sheet only. No pillow case, no cover sheet. Not sure who's fault it is about the misleading page."
2,just small enough for the camera,I thought it would be bigger but good enough ok for the belt for on the go
5,The Best,"If your imagination is better than any book or movie, you'll love these CD's (and their precursor, The Fourth Tower of Inverness). The sights, the sounds, the smells -- I was there, in the story. It surrounds and involves you like nothing else I've ever heard. And the story itself is fun, fascinating, and educational at the same time. I have enjoyed listening over and over again, and always pick up something I've missed. This will open doors in your mind!"
1,bad service,I specifically ordered a discontinued item that was shown on this site as still available through them. They substituted a different item and now refuse to send me a return label for the wrong item shipped.
1,Great Idea - poor execution,"I first heard about this CD from a review in the local paper. It mentioned dance beats to Kitaro's songs. I thought to myself..what a great idea. Instead, I was very upset to have wasted my money on this. The dance beats are NOT HOUSE or TRANCE (which would have been a better idea for a CD), but rather Jazzy (Fusion?). Of the songs that Kitaro has...they picked some lames ones to use for this album. There are 12 songs on this CD and not one of them is worth ever listening to again. I have been a Kitaro fan for YEARS...and NOTHING really good has been part of the DOMO label for Kitaro. I keep hoping to hear his melodic sounds and his soft high pitched keyboard that he uses in the earlier works...what happened to that? I wish Kitaro would compose songs like he used to. As for the artists on this album...nice try...but next time try using actual themes in your songs, PLEASE!!!"
4,Just when things get good....,I opened this book with high amounts of anticipation. I was not disappointed. I was very excited at the beginning but as the book progressed I became annoyed with the whole mysterious point of view.I am also annoyed at Gaia for standing Ed up.All in all though it was a entertaining read and I cannot wait for the next book!
4,Lost,I don't like that Sam is back. There were a few parts where I though Sam and Gaia were gonna make out. And I think Ed knows something is up but he isn't saying anything to Gaia because he loves her so much. I think Jake and Gaia should get to know each other and become friends but not the best of frieds for sure. I have to admit the book is getting boring again with Sam back in the picture. I thought Ed was going to end up asking Gaia to marry her some day and that would be so sweet.
5,quiltmaker,I have a set of dishes (Friendly Village). This salt and peppers shakers was a welcome addition to this set. I use it frequently.
3,Johnson Brothers Friendly Village Salt and pepper,"Shakers were great, but the stopper in the bottom of one didn't fit and contents would spill out.Sent them back 2 times and both were the same.I would buy them if the stoppers fit like thy should."
1,A definate miss!,"If you're a fan of constant historical inaccuracies, improbable, cardboard characters, and cliched writing, this is the book for you. Apart from the, of course, handsome, studly hero, (who, even though captain of his ship, is kind enough to give the helmsman plenty oftime off by taking the wheel himself) and the, naturally, incredibly beautiful, feisty heroine (who can outdo the average man at fencing and knife throwing and even cooks) even the sex comes from the ""how to write a romance novel"" book. The author is also bored enough by this book that she cannot keep track of the fact that the couple ""waltz together as if they had been doing it all their lives"" at a Christmas ball in the first half of the book but, towards the end of the book, at another ball ""they had never actually danced before""."
1,Vaguely disappointing,"I really wanted to like this book but couldn't. The characters are one dimensional, and the flavour of New Orleans and England are both lacking. LaFitte's character is ridiculous. The general vocabulary and tone of the book do not refelect the era in which it is set. The protagonists are a promising outline that never expands beyond that. I recommend the reader pass this one by."
5,Magic moments....,"""Deadly Happy symbolises for me those magic moments when time stands still, everything makes perfect sense and you feel in a moment like this you could die..."" this is Deadly Happy in the sonwriter's words. And Deadly Happy gives you these magic moments...Andreas rocks with his guitar and he also writes gorgeous ballads.There is End of The World, you hear it and you'll be singing it for days! Listen to Brand New thing ,Spirit of you and The pretty ones guaranteed the house to be rocking! And The greates day has a warm, mystical sound.Deadly Happy is ...perfect songwriting, touching lyrics and a lot of heart.If you are a Johnson's fan you will not be disapointed, if you are not a Johnson's fan..You just might become one. Trust me on this one...Fantastic!"
3,The Professional Log Home,"I am an electrician and not a home builder. And while I can frame a wall or build a shed fairly well I won't pretend that I could build an entire home without technical help. One day I would like to build a small log cabin with my family, even if it takes years. This book along with a few others that I read basically assumes that the reader will build a log home with the help of some contractors and even gives tips on being a GC. And while that is probably good advice to find the best and most experienced people to help build this home it isn't very pioneer.If you are looking to build a log home as your primary residence than by all means read this book and others like it. If you are looking to build a small place and have fun doing it there are other books out there that are better suited."
4,Very comprehensive,A very easy to read book(although technical in places) for the person serious about building your own log house. Beautiful photos make dreaming easy in this book.
5,Effective,"I bought it for my daughter who was getting anxious as her wedding was approaching, so she started taking it and was really effective so she could regain a deep sleep."
2,Maybe they were just trying a little too hard,"I checked out this book for the one story about the chain letter. I guess, yes, if I lived in a world where magic was commonplace (or, I should say, remotely plausible) then the scare factor of the ""forward this or else"" clause would be much higher. Because then it might actually be able to curse you, unlike here on Earth. Where it's forwarding the chain letter that will get you cursed... at by everyone you send it to!But the book itself was adolescent and cliché and boring, something I might have read in middle school. In fact, it did seem very dated. One or two of the stories were cute, but mostly it wasn't worth the time."
4,LOL!,"Eighteen stories of warrior women who come to men in distress. The tables have been turned! This is the second in, what I hope will be, a series. These women may look like ""babes"" in very little chain mail, but they show themselves to be able to take care of themselves...and other men. My husband and I enjoyed it thoroughly!"
1,Ugh,"I really wanted to like this book. It was impossible. Utterly IMPOSSIBLE! Ok, now I understand why S&S gets worse every year, if THIS is the cream of the fantasy-writing crop. The 1st story was so horrible, I couldn't even finish it, couldn't uncurl my contemptuous lip for 45 minutes. I almost threw the book away right there. Fortunately, the rest of the book is slightly better but I'm still sorry I wasted money on it."
5,Defensive Racism,"Very eye opening. Ed Steele brings out points that few are willing to do so. I can see how the white male has been subjected to criticism and has cowered over the years. I can see his point of Western Civilization diminishing in importance and the Asian influence to take over. Well written and not at all offensive. He did not point out things that are not true. But I can see how the Liberal Establishment would attack him for what he said, but cannot refute his ideas. Ed Steele won me over.DP"
1,Author charged with attempting murder for hire,"It should be known that this ""honorable man"" has been has been charged by federal prosecutors for hiring a hit man to kill his wife and mother-in-law. If this is the reality he is espousing, he can keep it. Real men of any color can exit a relationship without murder.[...]"
5,great product!,"I just started using this product and I'm happy with it. It's designed well, it meets my needs, and is good for environment."
4,A safer alternative to chlorine bleached pads,When I learned of the dangers of using chlorinated pads and tampons I switched to non-chlorine. Companies use chlorine to bleach the pads and tampons white. Well I certainly do not want to put chlorinated things near a very delicate place. These pads are good although be careful to change them often as leaks may occur. But this is definitely a safer option and I would highly recommend. This is also a good price as they can be quite pricey when bought singly at the heath food store.
1,Green and Embarrassing!,"I was very excited to try this product because of the trustworthy company who manufactured it and the fact that it didn't have chlorine, however I believe some additional testing and a revision of the current product is in order. The absorbency is fine for a light day, but for those of us who suffer from heavier periods, take my advice and don't rely on this pad! I've never had an accident before using these, and the one I had in front of my friends was horrifying to say the least. I'd hate for anyone else to go through that, so please use caution with these pads. They are not absorbent enough and a bit on the short side of things. I also agree that the stickiness is sometimes too much and can leave permanent reminders."
4,Good daytime pad,"The best feature of these pads is that they have a soft, cottony cover that doesn't irritate my bikini area the way Always' plastic-lined pads do. The price is great on Amazon with Subscribe and Save; I feel good about using products that are safer for my health as well as the environment; and they stay securely in place. Two things that could be improved: (1) the pads are a little stiff right out of the wrapper, so I bend them in half long-ways a couple of times and they're fine; (2) I wish the wrapper had a resealable sticky tape like Always does to make disposal easier and more sanitary. Also worth mentioning is that I did have a leakage problem when I wore it overnight -- so I suggest wearing the Ultra-Thin Overnight for that purpose. But I'm definitely sticking with these, and never going back again!!!"
3,Too Sticky!,"The wings of the pads stick so well that sticky pieces of the pad stick to your underwear. On more than one occasion I had to try to scrape and pick pieces off which took forever. I don't like wearing ""granny"" underwear when I have my period but I don't want to ruin my cute ones either! With the same stay free ultra thin regular I did not feel wet. With these pads I feel wet and uncomfortable often. I might try a heavier pad (without wings) through seventh generation before giving up hope."
3,Review of 'Trail of Tears',I found the writing to be very elementary. I guess I had expected it to be more sophisticated. But the reason for my buying it was for information and that I certainly have gotten. CM
2,Not what I expected,"I read it in search of a history of the Cherokee nation. I was disturbed by the historical mistakes that have already been pointed out.An attempt is made to portray Indian culture realistically, not as a mythical spiritually advanced lifestyle. And they are shown to have both highminded idealists and untrustworthy self-seeking SOB's, just as the Anglos did. However, the uneven style -- from biographical narrative to didactic textbook to philosophical musings -- make the book virtually unreadable. Not recommended."
2,Very detailed...,"I ordered this book for a research paper on how Western Expansion affected Native American culture. It's the kind of book that one needs to sit and just read through. It's not the kind of book to easily extract information out of for a paper.The author includes much detail about Cherokee culture and characteristics of the people, about politics at the time, particular events during battle, etc. This is spread out through the entire book. It would make good summer reading if it could keep your interest. My suggestion is to read the inside before purchasing."
2,Very Disappointed,"This book was a big let down. Like other reviews have said, he focus almost entirely on the Ridge family and is very biased toward them. He also puts hundreds of letters and documents in the book, which I cannot stand. I have a better idea: Why don't you read those documents and give me an interpretation of them? I have read several books about Native American History out west and this was my first book on the Cherokee. I do not recommend this book."
1,Arrogantly Biased,"This book is disjointed and very hard to follow when reading. John Ehle (E-Lee) has no Native American blood running through his veins and after struggling to get to the end of this book it is quite apparent. The title is misleading. The title could have read, ""John Ehle's Personal View of the Cherokees During the Trail of Tears"". His writing style is one of the worst I have tried to wade through while reading. Do not waste your time with this book."
3,It could have been better,"The historical information and the story itself was interesting, but I didn't favor his style of writing. His writing was very one dimensional and undescriptive. Instead of creating vivid images that pull you into the story, it was like reading a police report. Also, the author seemed a little biased against the Cherokees. But if you are interested in Native American history I still think it is worth reading."
1,A much better version . . .,"If you want to read a much more unbiased and factually correct version of this story, please readCherokee Tragedy : The Ridge Family and the Decimation of a People (Civilization of the American Indian Series, Vol 169) by Thurman Wilkins.The tragedy of the Trail of Tears was that all the Cherokee leaders were trying to do what they thought was best for the tribe. It was, obviously, a no win situation. Ehle is much to skewed to one side over the other and this bias makes this book unfortunate. I do not recommend it."
3,Trail of Tears; The Rise and Fall of the Cherokee Nation,"Well written however, this is not the book to buy if you wish to read about the Trail of Tears. I think the title of this book is very misleading and should only be Named the history of the Cherokee Nation. It does however have wonderful historical letters and documentation from within, which keeps it a good read. None the less I found it leaned to the ""White"" version of historical events. Certainly the case in the last 20 pages which is about the Trail of Tears. I was disapointed."
2,Trail of Tears,I didn't like the book because it was boring and went into too much detail on rituals of the Cherokee Nation. I would not recommend it to anyone to read.
4,Interesting,"This was my first introduction to the history of the Cherokees. Unlike other reviewers, I can't judge the accuracy of the history. Some reviewers give it high praise, and some think it's riddled with mistakes. I think the book falls somewhere in between.The beginning of the book was very difficult to get through. The book does pick up and becomes quite disturbing. However, this is part of the forgotten history of our country. Overall, I think the book was forth 4 stars."
5,"very interesting, fasinating, daughters loved it",Found at a new bookstore..15 year old daughter found it...read it we all did not know any of the info that happened to the Cherokee...Government at that time..& still is hurting the Native Americans and even their Other citizens of this country...I pray that something will change... but change has to come from the citizens & natives of this country before anything can happen...I pray soon before it's too late.
2,Woefully inomplete and biased,"The ""Rise"" of the Cherokee nation is nowhere to be found in this book. In fact the ""Fall"" is well underway before chapter one, and continues to this day with the publication of tripe like this.Any fair depiction of a clash of cultures needs to see each culture in it's context. Ehle doesn't seem to attempt this. His descriptions of Cherokee and settler life make no attempt to relate to their specific histories, but merely poke at them with a judgemental 20th century stick.Two stars are simply because he has thrown out many names that anyone with a serious interest in the subject can use as tools for research."
2,full moon is full of filler songs,with any rodney jerkins based album youre going to have repeats --- songs that sound like others and with this album theres no difference in the pattern lisntening to this cd i thought i was listening to the lead off single with each new track that came on. . . i was dismayed to find that what about us is #9 . . . there are many low points but rather than criticize brandy and hurt her or sonya's feelings ill say the highpoint is track # 3 brandy really actually shows that she can sing --- even though shes under the weight of all those sound effects --- on a personal note i am glad to see that she has taken such a positive direction in her adult years and is to be commended to being a vegan being married and getting a new stylist --- i can sum this album up in a simple sentence. i like brandy which is why i have the album . . . the ONLY reason
2,Average&Standard,I can See Why Michael Jackson Turned down alot of Rodney Darkchild Jerkins Tracks.Rodney got One Good Hook&a Smoothed out Flow for a Good Run but that doesn't make a Song.Brandy should have gotten with Teddy Riley to add some real Grooves here.Her Voice is on the Janet tip a Bit&that ain't good.Brandy can out sing Janet Jackson in Her Sleep.only a few songs worth given even a 2nd listen to.Average Set on a whole.
3,Not Brandy's Best,"It's sad. Full moon tries so hard to impress, but fails. Gone are the innocent, slightly funky, always enjoyable songs of Brandys past efforts. Now we hear a more mature, grownup woman. Is that a bad thing? No. Is this album bad? Slightly. I won't lie, Full Moon is very appealing. There's something about the songs that draw you in, feel you with confidence that this is going to be a great ablum. Then somewhere down the line it loses it's touch. Halfway through the third song i felt dissappointed, and annoyed. Brandy inlisted Rodney Jerkins to produce most of this album, and that was a mistake. Full moon is to electronically driven. The machine created beats fail to trully offer a level of funk that you'd expect. while this formula is less than successfull on the fast paced jams, it's even worst on the ballads. Only the songs that that sound less computer generated, and more insturmental really shine. Full Moon offers few good tracks, and much useless garbage."
4,Earlier albums were better...,"Brandy has come a long way over the years, but I don't know why she had to change her style so much for this album compared to the previous two. I enjoy listening to her first two albums, so I automatically bought this one when it came out. I think I've tried to listen to it twice and gave up after skipping through the songs. I'm sure true R & B fans will get into this cd more than I did though."
5,Brandy's new album is the best,"This album is the best out her other cds. She has all these banging songs, with these nice touchy R&B beat. The best songs are, Full Moon, When you touch me, All in me,What about us,I thought,Can we,Its not wirth it,He is(My favorite) and Wow. Mainly her Cd is all good."
5,Wonderful Album,"I see why they call this album the R&B Bible! This is the album where Brandy's voice took a turn for the best! She was already great, but wow! From start to finish, there is not one song that I did not like. My favorites include When You Touch Me, Like This, Wow, Love Wouldn't Count Me Out, Full Moon, He Is, Nothing. I pretty much loved every song! Brandy is the greatest!!!"
5,"Grown up CD, Grown up Woman!","I LOVE this CD. The beats are all that and then some. I think she has matured and all for the better. She is a wife, mother-to-be and this CD proves she is ready to be an adult in the R&B world too. I have never really liked any of Brandy's CD's always thought them to popish. But... I had to get this CD when I heard ""Full Moon"" and ""What about us"". Yes I definitely say get this CD, those two songs alone, are worth it, but the other songs round of the CD very nicely. I like ""Apart"", ""I thought"" etc. And the new version of ""Die Without you"" is sweet with Brandy singing with her younger brother. Bravo Brandy keep getting better:)"
5,A Full Moon indeed!,"Brandy's junior album is one of the hottest albums currently on the market. I purchased her cd days after it was released, and I have been impressed every step of the way. Her talent as an artist supercedes her previous albums. Her sultry beats are felt in this cd. The passion it took is heard loud and clear. A die hard fan of both the late Aaliyah and Brandy, Brandy's tracks (like Aaliyah's), are melodic tunes of love, pain, joy and redemption. She has claimed her name as an adult on this album. This is a woman's opinion.""Keep it Rockin, B-Rocka"" :-)"
4,B-Rock's All In Me,Full Moon is a great album. It shows that Brandy's vocal talent has really sky rocketed. Her voice is da bomb her songs however are not as good as the ones on her last album 'Never Say Never'. Most of the songs are ear catching but u find yourself getting tired of them easily. It's still a relatively good project with songs like 'All In Me' and 'It's Not Worth It' being potential#1 hits. Brandy's back and here to stay. I look forward to furture releases form this talented singer.
3,Mechanically Correct,"After listening to this album, I came to the conclusion that with Brandy it's all about the production. Though Rodney Jerkins pulled a few new tricks out of his hat, he made Brandy's true talent disappear. She always had a flair for improvising her songs like no one else could. She always had a good flow, like Whitney used to have. This album doesn't showcase it at all. It sounds too mechanical. It's just full of staccato licks pieced together. The lyrics aren't too bland, but there's no real fire in her vocals. This album doesn't come close to her previous ones. On those, she showed much warmth and depth for a young girl. This time out she sounds like a robot. I hope her live performances allow her to bring out the true vocalist she really is."
1,I WISH I COULD GIVE IT 0 STARS,I am a fan of Brandy's but the cd STINKS. I wish I could take it back and get my money back. It is just too much Dark Child for me. Maybe she should have worked with a more variety of producers. She sounds like a robot. But that's just my opinion. PEACE
1,you have done better,"Brandy is talented - we all know that. Hence I was disappointed with 'Full Moon' because it did not capture her true music spirit. I gotta give it her though on the track ""Full Moon"" and PM Dwan's ""I'd die without you"".....very well sung and produced. All in all, I felt that with the new marraige and pregnancy, she was not able to give it her all as I have felt she has done in past."
4,Brandy is back....,"Brandy has made a major comeback and I am glad becuz she has talent for real. I really wasn't feelin' the song ""What About Us"", but it grew on me. However, I LOVE ""Full Moon"" and I can't wait for the next single. I'm also happy for her having a baby and happily married. Good luck and much love, ma!"
3,Rodney Jerkins is to be blamed for this Album's Fall!!,"Brandy is a great artist sometimes over looked or even bashed by most because of her lack of thug appeal but she can really sing. This album was a flop but only because she let Rodney Jerkins do most of the album. Every song he produced sounds the same or wack except ""when you touch me"" This song shows real vocal growth in brandy. Full moon by Mike City should've been the first single. There are about four great songs on this album but the songs by Rodney Jerkins & Robert Smith which are horrible drown them out with computer sounds and strange sounds from brandy. Mike City and Warren Campbell should be used again and a couple new producers would do her some good."
4,Brandy's Full Moon Delivers More Than Bargened For,"It has been awhile since fans have heard from the beautiful Brandy and now she makes a return with Full Moon. This is a very solid R&B album. There are some real nice uptempo tracks ('What About Us?,' 'I Thought,' 'Anybody') and plenty of perfect slow jams ('Full Moon,' 'Come A Little Closer,' 'When You Touch Me,' 'Wow'). And the duet with her brother Ray J is awesome. 'Die Without You' is such a great song; the lyrics, the rhythm, the mood, it's all perfect and shows the chemistry between Brandy and her brother. I'm not much of a Brandy fan, only actually a fan of her songs that hit the radio, but this is definetly a great change from what R&B I usually listen to. I'm used to artists like Tank, Jaheim, Boyz II Men, Joe, Jagged Edge, Case..you know, that kind. But THIS is a great album and is definetly worth checking out."
5,WOW,"Brandy's new album has been long awaited, and one that was worth the wait. I wish there would have been more fast songs, but I am overly satisfied with the CD. The fast songs tend to be kind of electronic sounding, with strong beats and catchy hooks. The slow songs all sound like love ballads, but all the songs are good. If you are a fan of Brandy, or if you aren't, this CD is different from her others so check it out!"
5,Brandy's Back,"I love this new CD. I loved it before I even heard it. I was trying to listen to the CD online, but my computer kept having trouble with the buffering for me to hear it. However, I heard bits and pieces of Full Moon (the second track), and I loved it, as well as the wole album. I have been a huge Brandy fan for as long as I can remember. The album shows Brandy's progress as an artist and as a woman. We should expect nothing but the best from her. And this album is probably the best from her yet, I'm sure we'll have much more good music from her, but at the moment this album definitely suffices."
4,Awesome,"I have been a huge Brandy fan since NSN and I totally love Full Moon. She was my door in to full length cds that I enjoyed. Everyone is complaining about the length but I love having lots of Brandy songs to listen to, it makes the wait even better. I honestly think this is an amazing cd. Brandy has got it all. Stand outs:2. Full Moon4. When You Touch Me8. Can We10. Anybody14. Come A Little Closerand the best track on the album is 16: WOW.That is single material."
5,"""Full Moon"", it's Brandy at her best!","I have been a Brandy fan forever. I really didn't know what the new album was going to sound like. So the night before Full Moon came out, I looked out my window and looked over at the lake in my back yard and seen a Full Moon. At the point Brandy's single,""What About Us?"" came on, and I knew then and their the album was going to be a hit. If you loved Brandy(self-titled), Never-S-A-Y-Never, you'll die if you don't have this. It is the best R&B album of 2002 so far..."
1,Disapointing to say the Least,"Brandy is back with a new album, called FULL MOON. I have to say, as much as I want to like this album, I can't. The album is overproduced with garbled and mixed up songs in terms of production, thanks to Rodney Jerkins, who hasn't produced a good song since 1999. This leads many of the songs to sound the exact same. Take ""I Thought"", ""What About Us"", ""All In Me"" and many others and you have the exact same songs with different lyrics. There are too many songs, 17 songs and you feel bored at the end, especially since this album has no consistency whatsoever. It puts all the ballads with a few exceptions at the end of the disc, and during the middle you will feel lost with songs that sound like they are the exact same. Overall its very disapointing and if I had to pick one jewel in this crown, I would say the ballad ""Come A Little Closer"", which is a wonderful song. Overall be careful when purchasing this one."
1,A terrible comeback.,"Brandys third album is just absolutely TERRIBLE.Aaliyah's third album was much better, and i suggest you check out ""Aaliyah"" instead of ""Full Moon"".Do not waste your money on this album, you will definetly regret it."
3,READ THE WHOLE THING THEN MAKE YOUR VOTE,"Brandy is not one of my favorites right now.I really liked the song featuring Monica ""the boy is mine"" but this album is starting to annony me!The song ""Full Moon"" is a great song and some of her others,but spear me for ""What About Us?"".Of course I know I'm out voted If all the Brandy lovers read this but I want to tell you my opionon.""What About Us?"" (to me)needs some work.It sounds like a bounch of pots,pans,and dodads just clanging together to make a noise.Of course there is back ground music to back it up and stuff,but the song bits.One thing I noticed in the song is that a guy says ""Dark Child"" at the end of her song.Dark Child is a company that preduced the songs basically.So even though I'm out voted on this I still got to say my opionon and it's your chose if you think I'm right."
3,The Wolves aint out cause there was never a full moon....,"OKAY lets start out by saying.......Brandy is a craftful singer ho really can sing and has great talent, but this album sounds like she was at home chilling with Monica on he karaoke machine sampling and Monica was like,""yeah girl that is hot"", so her album would sound better.....but come to find out Monica has done the same thing. Have you heard ""all eyes on me""..... I'm sorry Brandy, the album has couple of good tracks like,""When U Touch Me"" an ""Nothing"", but production sounds like smeared Timbaland beats that Darkchild jacked.... Darkchild is to Brandy to Timbaland is to Aaliyah and everything must come to a good end.... Brandy....the sun on your career has set and yours to Monica. Sorry but All Eyes aren't on u anymore. They are on Amerie and Tweet.... Ashanti, sorry, keep writing for Jho, i man JLO... thats my opinion, email me if u agree"
1,Brandys career is over.,"Anything else Brandy releases will FLOP. ""Full moon"" ruined hercareer forever..(Thank God)."
5,BRANDY AT HER ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!!,"I am amazed with this CD. Brandy's last cds were great but this one tops each of them. I love practically every song! The last time I bought a cd and admired it so much was Janet Jackson's Velvet Rope!!! Simply put...BUY IT!!! And even after that, purchase a couple for your family and friends!!!"
3,7 months after the fact,"Well, I've had this album for 7 months, and I have to say it sounds much better now. I was expecting this album to impress me as Never Say Never had initially done, but it didn't, and still hasn't; however, it's one of the best R&B albums of the year (That should say a lot about R&B music)!!! The thing about this album is, you either love it or hate it, there is no neutrality, and I love: Full Moon, All in me, Can we, What about us, Anybody, and Wow. Nothing is also a favorite because it reminds me of Put that on everything. This album works really well to an extent, but I hope her next LP (expected next year)takes it to the next level."
3,Nothing Bad But Not Much Good Either,"Brandy's cd has good production but aside from several songs their is nothing special. Her first single What About Us? has a nice fast beat and is a great song but their are several other songs which sound almost the same with alike beats. Full Moon is probably the best song which shows Brandy's excellent voice range and a good all around second single. He Is is her best of many so so ballads that is beautiful. All In Me is also a good song that sounds a lot like Destiny's Child in parts. Maybe in her next effort she can make a little different of an album, write some of the album but this is improved."
5,NO BRANDY DIDN'T...,"Brandy, all I have to say is that you came TIGHT with this one. I have always been a Brandy fan and hearing this CD made me realize why I like her so much. If you are a fan of Brandy's and you like that ""Brokenhearted"" Brandy, You will love this CD. It shows her true talent and how she has evovled. So yes, I feel her when she names her CD Full Moon. You Go Brandy!!!!!"
5,FULL MOON IS BRANDY'S BEST ALBUM,"I remembered waiting and waiting and waiting for this album to dropped. I thought that there could never be an album released better than NEVER-SAY-NEVER but I was wrong. FULL MOON is the bomb. I've listened to this CD over and over and over and I like it more and more everyday. Brandy is fierce and she's a talented singer and actress. Unfortunately, FULL MOON has been only certified PLATINUM which is good for selling albums but a let down for her. NEVER-SAY-NEVER sold over 5 million copies to date. I think that people was trying to compare this album to her last one because everyone loved her last album. I wish people would listen to FULL MOON more so they could understand what she's saying. She has grown and matured so much and she'll always be one of my favorite entertainers. Right now, she's going through a divorce but she's in the studio right now getting ready for her 4th LP. Brandy is the bomb."
4,Brandy's New Style,This Album showed a change from what she normally does and what makes it interesting is that she still was wprking with Rodney Jerkins. All the slow songs are good and the only drawback would be the upbeat songs. They are either a hit or a way miss. A perfect balance of slow & fast and I like her new attempt. I believe this was a good CD overall.
4,She has Grown,"Ive been listening to Brandy since I was a child coloring in the first grade. I say she has really grown in to a grown woman. I think this album is more of a mark for her being an adult but its not her best, her best work I would have to say is Never Say Never the multi-platinum chart topper of 1998. She has come a far way from fighting over a man to know talking about her man needing her and her not needing him, but its all that comes with the role of being a super girl turning into a Super Woman."
5,THE REVIEW OF BRANDY'S ALBUM,"Bandy's new album is so amzing, to me I think this IS her best album yet. The title of Brandy's album explain it all. Full moon show that she is more mature and is at her brightest stage of her life. I love every song on it I listen to it everyday.This album everybody should pick it up."
5,This Album is Hot,All I can Say About this Album is Wow I mean Brandy is All growned up I have Much Love 4 Brandy and I will still always be Brandy's Fan YOU GO BRANDY!
5,Brandys back & Full Moon is Rockin,"I dont think there could have been any other Album as good as this one. Brandy has gone all out to make this CD be wonderful. Everyone has gone through a lot of stuff, and now we know that Brandy is now an adult and on Full Moon she shows it all. With her song ""What about us"", believe that, that song is not the only good song on the album. If you thought ""Never Say Never"" was good then you have to check out ""Full Moon"".With the out standing beats to Brandys eatiful voice,""Full Moon"" will go more then just platinum."
5,"A wonderful companion album to ""Aaliyah""!","When Brandy first showed up on the music scene back in (I think it was) 1994, she was just considered as one of the young child singers. Now 8 years later, that little girl is married, about to have a baby, and has released a brilliant album, entitled ""Full Moon""!Now if you are a big fan of Aaliyah or Brandy, then if you haven't purchased this CD, then you are crazy and don't know what you're missing!This album has some of the best constructed songs on a CD that I've heard in a while! I absolutely loved this CD! Please do yourself a favor and buy this awesome disc w/Aaliyah, you won't regret either purchase!"
5,Grows on ya,"this cd grows on you, I like the fact that there are 17 tracks! high points include WOW, FULL MOON, and WHAT ABOUT US? The actual cd flows pretty well and my only compaint is that on WHAT ABOUT US? there is a little editing on the track, I know there would not be a ""parental advisory"" just for leaving WHAT ABOUT US? in original form. Also a remix of WHAT ABOUT US? would have been nice since there was only a vinyl cd single available."
4,Growing up with brandy,"Yes we all loved ""Brandy"" with her pop/r&b sound. ""i wanna be down"" and ""best friend"". ""Never Say Never"" was a beautiful album a personal favorite of mine was ""put that on everything"" But Brandy has grown on every album, and i think this one really expresses who she is. When i first got this album i listened to it in my car for 2 weeks straight! Her voice is so much richer and full of tone then on previous albums. ""He is"" is def. my favorite. Those of you expected another ""i wanna be down"" are down right foolish. Brandy is matured into a mother and a wife and no longer needs to talk about meeting boys at the mall and waiting for phone calls in her room. I think i've grown right with her we are around the same age, I think she has a wonderful carreer ahead of her for years to come. Any one who likes Brandy and is a true fan will love it. If you like ""teen fluff"" I recommend sticking with Britney and Lil Romeo."
3,"OK, BUT NOT HER BEST","I have been a fan of Brandy's since day 1; she is one of my favorite singers. This album is nicely balanced with ballads and fast songs. However, most of the fast songs are overproduced; there is too many sound effects going on at once. The producers of this album did a great job on NEVER SAY NEVER, but were a little off on FULL MOON. On the other hand, the ballads are great, as Brandy's ballads always are. The best song, to me, on this album is ""When You Touch Me."" Her voice sounds really smooth and pretty on it; this song showcases her range and how much her voice has grown. Other good songs are ""Full Moon,"" ""Love Wouldn't Count Me Out,"" ""All in Me,"" and ""It's Not Worth It"" (which has vocalizations by Michael Jackson). If you really, really LOVED the sound of ""What About Us,"" then you will probably like FULL MOON, but I feel that NEVER SAY NEVER is Brandy at her best."
5,She's amazing!,"Brandy is beautiful singer. All of her albums shine especially Full Moon! I dont yet have this CD, but I'm sure it's really good as I've heard a few of the songs on the radio! The cover of the CD is excellent! She looks more beautiful than ever! This album is a must have for any R&B music lover! The song ""Full Moon"" has got to be the most beautiful song on here! How can anybody dislike her? She's the best! Just buy her new CD, have a listen and within a few secs, you'll think so too!"
5,there is not one dull moment,"from tracks such as Full moon to the very slow sensual songs like he is, I think that Brandy is going places and she has highlighted the fact that it's o.k to take a rest instead of rushing into things, artists who have lasted so long are always prepared to wait and not over expose."
1,Worst Junior album ever,Their are only 2 important songs on here Full Moon and What bout Us i jus thought the rest were filter and the rest wasnt important
1,Nothing like you have not heard a 100 times before,"When she was on Oprah years ago, she semmed like a nice person and she's cute and have a okay voice. But her songs are very very boring and I really hope she will making some really hot dance songs soon. I will not buy this but I What About Us and Full Moon. So Brandy has the voice and the looks but the songs are not very good. Nothing like you have not heard a 100 times before."
3,Not enough hype,The songs that were released were good. Too bad she didn't promote the album more but being is more important than a career that she will always have for a while. Do your thang girl. Be sucessful and excel at both
3,A little dissapointed cause never say never was lots better!,"This is not a completely horrible album. But it shows no maturiy from her last LP. The title track is just an average rnb songs but the best on the LP. The good songs are: Full moon,What about us, it's not worth it and he is. The rest are just over-digitalized over-killed dark child joints. A lot of the songs are just evolved versions of her predessessor tracks. The cheezy ballads at the end sound like disney songs. The album is just boring. Oh yeah, When u toch me is a good song though. When i got this Cd, I played it with my sis in the car and found myself constantly on the ""next"" button. I pull out the Cd and she says"" sorry bought a sh*tty Cd! Sorry Brandy."
5,Innovative Nu Soul.,"While it's somewhat tempting to view ""Full Moon"" as a producer's showcase (and in many ways it is) the truth is there is really no other voice in modern soul music to match the sonic beauty and adventurous spirit of this brilliant LP. Brandy already showed us she's at home crooning sappy ballads and middle of the road uptempo cuts, but nothing she's done before will really prepare listeners for the sound and textures explored here. The already classic ""What About Us"", the thumping ""Can We"" and the astounding title cut are reason alone to own this masterpiece. She should be prepared though, most listeners claim to want something new, but with music this 'new' she's runs the risk of scaring away her teenybopper audience. Ah well, us grown ups will just have to take her under our wings now....and she's a welcome addition to the family!"
4,Definitely matured,"I think the Cd is definitely good, you can tell she's matured alot, especially in her voice; in some songs, comparing with the Cd Never say Never, you couldnt even tell that it's the same singer. But has had a positive effect on her music, and it's obvious that she's worked hard to get the record put together, (i mean really -almost 4 years in the making). It's pure R&B, with some sweet ballads in it, which compliments really nice. If you're in to R&B get it! I love it!"
2,Other books are better,"While Meyer has conducted many studies, this book remains unengaging and void of useful evaluation. Kovach and Resenstiel's ""Elements of Journalism"" offers more insight to emerging journalists about the state of the profession of journalism. Meyer's book has more to do with the theory of social science studies than journalism. Meyer took 250 pages to say what could have been said in one chapter or one magazine article."
5,Just as I remembered!,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday, but I am sure it was more for me. I remember when these first came out so long ago and were the ""tickle me elmo"" of the early 80's. She loved it as much as I remember loving mine! How could a little one not love her cabbage patch kid?"
1,very disapointed,I ordered this doll for my daughter 2 days before christmas. The doll that i ordered did not even resemble the doll in the picture. the doll that came had yellow hair instead of blonde hair and is very ugly. I could not return it because i had to have something to give my daughter for christmas.(the stores here had been out of them for a month) If you want the doll in the piture....don't get your hopes up. it will be diffrent.
4,"A beautiful piece of art, but does not engage today's kids","As a young girl, I was truly struck by this film; the music, the texture of the lighting, and the tall, dark, and handsome leading man leant it an uncannily romantic feel. However, when I tried shared the movie with the little girls I babysit for, the sophisticated narrative and general lack of explosions bored them to distraction. This particular telling of BLACK BEAUTY no longer serves its function as a children's story, but is nonetheless compelling for adults."
1,This version is not for young children!,"After hearing so much about Black Beauty, and studying horses with my 5yr old we got this movie at the library. I was sad that I had not previewed it before letting her view it. I was surprised to see the fighting with the men stabbed in the chest. After talking with some friends I have found out there are other versions of Black Beauty that are wonderful and good for children to see."
2,Not for the book's fans,"It is a fair movie with nice horses, but some of the scenes get kind of weird and it isn't at ALL like the book. The photography is good and the story is heartwarming but it gets very dull and strange. BTW, It was a great movie I thought!!!!!!!!!!!!!, June 30, 2002--is a verry long review somebody should take it off its as bad as the miovie."
2,Music lovely as always but vocals out of place,"I have long liked Lost in Twilight's music, and don't get me wrong I still do. However I do not like the vocals on any of the tracks. Perhaps if they were not singing in English I would be more accepting but they are. Or maybe singing is the wrong word, speaking would be more apt. The lyrics themselves are okay but they way they are ""spoken"" really doesn't fit with the music.But just because I am not as fond of this their new CD does not mean it is bad. In fact this CD is perfect for any angst ridden teen-aged goth looking for something to sulk to."
2,Please Forgive Me,"I was bored with this pretty quickly.I've been listening to Echo and the Bunnymen for 20 years and consider them, probably, one of my most important musical influences. I'm not sure that I'll be returning to this one anytime soon. It sounds to me like Will and Ian recorded this in two different worlds.Buy ""Porcupines"" instead.I am so very sorry."
2,Where are the Tunes?,"Like many on here, I'm a huge fan. Unlike many on here, I actually liked their last effort, ""What are you going to do...""This CD, however, is just so unremarkable. I only long for the ""old"" Echo insofar as I long for songs that, from the first time you heard them, would stick with you, get under your skin, demand that you play them again -- immediately.That's what made Ocean Rain great. Even (so called) filler like Kingdom just totally stuck with you. Subsequent albums, though often maligned, still had their fair share of grabbers.I have listened to ""Flowers"" three times and find myself trying to get into it. For the first time, my appreciation of the band is, well, forced.Tonight they play live -- perhaps the songs on Flowers need the conviction of an Echo and the Bunnymen live performance."
1,Only one song worth listening to more than once,"If you grew up listening to the Bunnymen, you will try hard to convince yourself that this is a decent album. It's not.The only song worth your time is ""It's Alright."" Nice pace and catchy. The title track would get a rating of tolerable. The other songs you wouldn't remember if you listened to the album ten times and then listened to it again the next day. In other words, the other songs have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. They're not interesting in the least. Seems to me the Backstreet Boys have more soul.I, for one, am quite upset that I shelled out fifteen bucks for this tripe. This album is a good reason why Napster was so successful- people just don't like buying albums when only one song is worthwhile."
1,Stunned,"I am stunned at how bad this album is. It's nothing but palty and, as another reviewer commented, dead boring. There was some hope after the ""What are you going to do . . ."" aluum but this new record only re-affirms how the Bunnymen utterly .... They were the best - and their first 4 albums are still simply incredible - but the band's current efforts are no longer sad - they're starting to get annoying."
2,Unrecognizable!,"Echo & The Bunnymen have been one of the few guitar oriented bands that I have loved. Apart from the warm voice of Ian and his great vocal melodies, I feel that the strength of the band has been its originality. From the urgency of their second album (Heaven...) through the lucious strings of their fourth album (Ocean..), they created unique atmospheres and soundscapes. Their late 90s return album was awsome too.But ""Flowers"" was a total dissapointment. For one thing, in ""Flowers"", they sound like a 1960's Cover Band. Except the songs aren't classics but rather uninspired material. And no soundscapes here."
4,Buy this CD! The band just gets better with age.,"I have been a fan of Echo & The Bunnymen since around 1985. Once I heard them, I had to get my hands on everything they had made previously, and I continue to buy what the band releases.I thought they had reached their peak with ""Evergreen"" in 1997, but ""Flowers"" -- albeit more mellow than other releases -- is musically and lyrically superior to most of the band's releases. Doubtful they'll top the success of their self-titled album in the late 80's (or ""Ocean Rain"" for that matter) but it doesn't matter. The band has a made an album that reaches across genres to (hopefully) give the band a wider audience. It is such a good album. Fans of any of their old stuff will be instantly amazed at this release.Let's hope they get the promo they deserve in the States.I suggest buying a few copies of this--give them to your friends."
4,The Best Bunnymen CD Since Ocean Rain (That s/ be 5 stars not 4),"Trippy guitar! Psychedelic sounding songs (rather than mere pop songs) - this is the Echo & the Bunnymen we know and love. It took awhile for these Flowers to grow on me - in fact, I discovered the greatness of the songs via the Live in Liverpool album, where they play several excellent tracks from this album.Lotsa Eastern-influenced hooks on this one, and that makes the big difference between this and Evergreen the other late-period stuff. It may take awhile to grow on ya, but once it does, you'll really dig this album, if you love Echo & the Bunnymen."
2,Another dud from a washed-up band,"It pains me to say this, since I have been listening to Echo and the Bunnymen since 1981, but the band is washed up and should never have reformed. ""Flowers"" is only marginally better than the appalling ""What Are You Going To Do With Your Life?"" This new CD, with a few exceptions, is slow, boring and completely uninteresting. Even Ian McCulloch's lyrics disappoint. I'll always listen to ""Heaven Up Here,"" ""Ocean Rain"" and the self-titled CD, but this is the last new release I intend to buy by Echo and the Bunnymen. It's just too painful listening to what once a great band descend into bland, middle-of-the-road pop."
5,For software engineers / programmers an excellent choice,"This excellent book enabled me to design my first graphics pipeline from scratch. Even though technologies like DirectX, OpenGL and Glide provide this all for you on a platter today; if you want to understand the maths that they all share at their core, this is the book !"
3,FACT OR FICTION?,"Just reading an excerpt from this book I have noticed at least 2 discrepencies..He has spelled Hierins wrong. The Lipstick Killer)and The shooting at the Mcdonalds was in San Ysidro,Ca. Not Los Angeles. Small details I know but still"
3,not much,"very imcomplete.Speck,isnt in book..theres beter ot there fast service.very fast using frrree delievery jimmi"
5,Informative & Concise,"For anyone interested in serial killers and the reasons behind their actions, this book is highly recommended. I especially enjoyed how the author includes possible biological reasons as to why the men profiled in the book murder repeatedly. This is a good book for people who have not read anything about serial killers."
5,A mind blowing look into the mind of a serial killer,"If you wanting answers into why serial killers kill, and or reapetedly, you need not to look any further. This book gives an insightful and explanitory look into the mind and body of the infamuos serial killer. I recomend this book to any that wants an answer to the question ""Why""."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,This product is absolute Bunk. Do not buy it! The covers do not clip on to the screw caps at all. The covers slip right off and are not made to the correct size for the screw caps. This product is absolutely worthless. Do not waste your money.
3,Can't Fraser get better roles?,"I see Fraser as a good actor with lots of potential for stardom but he is being typecasted in dumb roles lately (except for the Mummy series)-- this film being one of them. Though there were some funny scenes, I did not find the entire film hilarious. There were other ""stars"" in the cast but they were not given more exposure. The film was primarily carried by Fraser, who though great with his goofy antics, was simultaneously tiresome being typecasted in such roles. If there ever was one thing I would remember it for for a long long time, it would be the annoying monkey character that Stu has made. If they meant that creature to represent the dark side of our ever lovable protagonist ""Stu"", then at least, they were successful in irritating the viewers."
2,Silly And Outright Not Funny At All,Brenden Fraser Is A great actor but chooses dumb film roles thatmake him look like a fool thus not making a great actor he canbe. After a car crash Stu(Fraser)after comming to from a comastu's alter ego Monkeybone takes over his body and escapes towreak havoc on socitey. This film is by far Fraser's worstcompared to his other terrible comedies AIRHEADS(1994)BLAST FROM THE PAST(1999) Despite what other people say his best role wasin the powerful 1992 drama School Ties where he plays a jewishstudent who hides his herritge from his friends at an upscaleprivate school. It's been a long while Fraser Has done anythingmemorable dispite the sucsess of THE MUMMEY.
1,Brendan is so much better than this.,"Let me say that I love Brendan Fraser and will usually buy all his movies. However, this movie stinks! Brandan's sense of humor is obvious in this movie and it is the only thing that gives it the 1 star. The story line is stupid and I could not wait for the movie to end. Even with some great stars in it, and some good animation - all the best parts were in the commercial for the movie. Leave this monkey in the zoo - unless you have to have Brandan in your collection. Oh Brandon is not even shirtless in this. Bummer but then it is obvious he is on his weight gain period of his life."
1,"UGLY,OVERBLOWN,HORRIBLE,MESSY,AND UNFUNNY","Worst film from director Henry Selick,he did well directing outstanding films such as A Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach.this terrible mess seems like a cheap comic book and not to interisting, Brendan Fraser is wasted in this film and Bridget Fonda is poorly performed in this film.the whole cast is wasted,but only chuckles come from lewd Monkeybone and Organ Donor Chris Kattan at the end.just terrible and unbearable."
1,An hour and a half I'll never have back...,"I hate to say it. Aside from a couple of fairly sharp gags, it's not all that funny - or dramatic - or good. Half the gags are stolen from Beetlejuice and the other half fall flat. Here's how bad this is - Whoopie Goldberg's appearance is a high point. Youch."
3,Good sfx and animation. The rest? Blech.,"Great interaction of CGI, animation, and live action. Seamless special effects. That's all that's good. Not in my list of the worst 10 movies, but darn clos"
3,Chris Kattan makes this bad film funny as hell,"This movie had a really interesting premise and characters, but fell short of actually being funny or interesting. This is not a movie I would recommend, except for Chris Kattan, who pulls off an amazing physical performance that was pure genius. This movie is only worth watching to see Chris Kattan in action which gets all 3 stars I give for his performance and 0 for the actually movie itself."
5,Great!,CD arrived on time and in great condition. Movie is an enjoyable addition to CD's I like to watch around the Haloween season.
4,"Fun, ridiculous, completely entertaining","The only way I can describe this movie is that it is weird. But that word doesn't do it justice. It's funny, hilarious at times, creepy, and more. Brendan Fraser seems to select the oddest scripts, but delivers fun with a lot of style. Bridget Fonda is spectacular in this film, delivering a strong presence. It's odd, with a strong psychological twist, but kick back and enjoy it!"
3,Mediocre Comedy,"Brendan Fraser plays an uptight cartoonist known for his character, Monkeybone. He has just hit it big but is not really interested in all of the hoopla or the merchandising contracts. All he wants to do is get married to his girlfriend/doctor, played by Bridgett Fonda. Before he can pop the question, however, he is in a car accident that sends him into a coma. In the coma, he enters a surreal world inhabited by others in coma. They all vie for their chance to return to the world of the living. When Fraser gets his chance, his opportunity is hijacked by Monkeybone, his cartoon character and a disturbed part of his own psyche. So the cartoon runs amuck in his real body while his mind is stuck in the comatose world trying to scheme its way back.The results of this situation are a few laughs but there is nothing truly memorable. The idea had potential for so much more. It was a find diversion but nothing memorable."
4,"I know it looks stupid, but trust me.......ts funny","I know it may look stupid but it is real funny. This movie is about a guy who is in a deep deep coma. He is in this fantasy land kinda thing. It reminds me of the set of Tim Burton's nightmare before christmas. Then he has this kinda pet named ""Monkey Bone"". Then once he finally gonna get out, Monkey bone betrays him. So now Stu (Brendan Fraser)has to find a way back to his girlfriend. This is a real funny movie. It has the kinda smart comedy we needed years ago."
1,one of the worst films of the last 20 years..this is no joke,"the plot is very original and the special effects are cool but the jokes all fail...badly..with jerking off jokes like ""excuse me i have to go choke my monkey"" this is a film that falls short in laughs and i mean that"
2,Ugh!,I love this movie and was really looking forward ti getting it. The shipping was very fast but the dvd is so scratched that is skips in multiple areas. The description said like new and in very good condition. That is not what I received. It would have been very nice to know that the disc was scratched.
1,a back breaker,"a week ago i injured my back at work and was laid up in bed...i asked a friend (yes i still call her friend after seeing this drivel) to borrow some dvd's to pass the time...along came monkey bone...i simply (chris kattan close your eyes) challenge anyone to turn off your tv for a week then sit through monkeybone...better yet please send 14.00 dollars my way if you care to throw away your cash...im at:patricio ramonep.o. box 45red bank,nj 07701"
4,Good one - but don't let the title fool you.,"Just because it has Brendan Frazer and Chris Katan in it and it's got some cartoon action, do not be fooled. Yes, it's VERY funny. But some of the humor is a little beyond youngsters. I don't recommend this movie for children under 10."
5,A True Cult Following Sort Of Movie,"After reading of the low success this movie found while in theaters last year, I am somewhat shocked by the fact, for after viewing the film several times on cable, and then finally deciding to purchase it on video, I found this title to be very entertaining. So much so, I even purchased its official movie poster and a lil' Monkeybone doll from another site to go along with the nostalgia of the movie..it was that good to me, and I'm sure to a few others as well. While disappointed at knowing pretty much there won't be a sequel, I'm satisfied knowing I gave this movie a try and let myself become indulged into its deranged and often times off the wall humor. A word of advice to those who've not seen it, I assure you that if you see it once, 50/50 your going to like it or not, so it just depends on your preferred comedy type. All in all, a funny Brendan Fraser flick."
3,Worth A Look,"I found this to be an entertaining and thought provoking movie for the most part. There were slow moments and scenes that had a choppy feel to them, but no more than the average slapstick type flick. EXCELLENT song during closing credits by Eleni Mandell, an incredibly talented new artist on the L.A. scene. Why they didn't include it on the soundtrack is a mystery for the ages. I would have bought the soundtrack JUST for that song. Oh well..."
3,The movie was ok....,"I liked the movie, and there were some humourous bits here and there. There really isn't anything that makes this film stand out, and I can see why some people wouldn't like ""Monkeybone"". All in all, this is a decent film good for a few laughs."
3,Working within the (Oxford) Form,"A good one-volume introduction to sonnets in English. John Fuller's strategies for selection are rational, given limitations imposed by his publisher; I'd have prefered inclusion of modern sonnet sequences and more selections by American poets. Perhaps John Fuller will publish a second volume of North American poets; the Oxford ""Companions"" follow this pattern. Solid, but, oddly for the Oxford Press, neither a comprehensive anthology for scholars nor a compendium for the general reader."
2,good acoustics,the product came in great condition shipped in a timely manner. the cd wasnt what i thought it was going to be it really sucks
4,Their best,"This is the only Firehouse album I have. I have heard their so called biggest hits in their original form, and I must say, the versions on this album is far better.This is a true ""summer"" CD, with loads of catchy melodies and good songs.The acoustic versions of tunes like ""Love of A Lifetime"" and ""When I Look Into Your Eyes"" is allright, but thats it really. The new songs on this album is the one that stands out.""You Are My Religion"", the song that opens this album, is simply catchy. And what a feel-good song. Number 4 on this album, ""Nothing At All"" is the albums best track, if you ask me. And of course, one of my favourite Firehouse tracks ""I Live My Life For You"". Why this song never was a hit, I cant believe.If you like acoustic rock, with catchy tunes and good songwriting, this is the album for you."
4,Music,I used to own this CD in the past. It was shipped in great condition and brought back the same memories as before.
4,A GOOD ROCK CD WITHOUT THE HEAVY EDGE.,THE SONGS ARE THE SAME EXCEPT FOR THE HEAVY ROCK EDGE. I RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANYONE WHO LOVES ACOUSTIC MUSIC.
4,Really Good if you like acoustic versions,I am a fan from Mexico and I think this is a really good CD. I like this versions better than the normal ones. I think it is worth to buy it.
5,GREAT BOOK,"The book contains:- Superb hints & tips- Broad, thorough examples- All source code on CDThe title suggests the target audience brilliantly. Great book. Nice one Gary!"
5,The Silver Crown,This book was read to me by one of my elementary school teachers and I remembered loving it while not remembering the entire story.I recently bought it to read to my 7 year old son who is as captivated by it as I was.
3,Shorter is Better,"After having read Robert C. O'Brien's other major works, I must admit that I was somewhat disappointed in ""The Silver Crown."" The plot is excellent and so is character development but the story doesn't really get started until page 200. The first 200 pages are about two children wandering in the woods. The remainder of the books is an intriguing story about a very young girl who must fight impossible odds in spite of the terrible burden she carries. Ellen is easily Ann Burden's equal (see ""Z For Zachariah""). I do recommend reading the book because it all comes together nicely at the end."
3,A mediocre fantasy book.,This book has an interesting plot i will admit. But by my opinion the story wasnt as well written as i thought it would be. Everynow and then it would seem to go on about nothing. It simply doesnt seem to be as good as i expected it to be. I wouldnt recommend this book but if you would like to read it....its your choice.
4,"Brava, Ellen!","The Silver Crown is one of the best books I have read. The descriptions used by the author were stunning in that they transported you there, following after Ellen as she went on her journey. Ellen is a very stong heroine. She still makes her share of mistakes, and she is someone almost anyone would want for a friend. I first borrowed this book from the library, but I ended up checking it out 4 times to reread. Finally I bought it, and have not regretted doing so. Every time I read it, I find somthing new and different. It seems so real that when I go hiking, I always check above the trees for the black malignite walls of the Dark Castle, or the glittering opening of the quartzite cave."
5,What We All Know!!!!,"The book "" The Silver Crown"" was a great book. It had describing words and interesting sentences. Ellen is a brave girl because if I was her I would not know what to do. This book showed me that I should be brave and ask for help when I need it. It was cool how they started the story on Ellen's birthday. I think that all the characters had a great part in the story and if I had to be a character in the book, I would be Ellen."
4,better for kids than adults!,"I just got a copy of this book after searching for it for years. It was deeply satisfying to read it again after so long, but it's no Harry Potter or Stuart Little! So much seems so absurd or predictable or off-topic that I can hardly believe that it is the same book that I remember. Nonetheless, based on the strong impression that it left on me 30+ years ago, I would still recommend Silver Crown for the elementary-age crowd."
2,Not for serious bike commute,"It is light and have enough capacity for bike commute if you are not carrying a laptop. But, it slips from back to side quite often and therefor not suitable for relatively long and serious bike commuting."
1,Pointless,"Not particularly spacious, and literally began to shred within three months of use. If you plan on using this more or less daily (like I did as a gym bag) you're definitely better off giving this one a pass. There's absolutely better to be found."
5,shoulder pack,"I shopped around for a shoulder pack, everyone I saw was over $40, I did not want to spend that much. This one is just as nice as the more expensive ones, great quality, just what I wanted."
1,don't waste your money.,"This bag is very cheap but the $15 would be far better spent on some takeout Chinese food.As I guess you would expect, cheap materials, very flimsy design, the strap is adjustable but not long enough for an adult over 6 feet tall.All in all .. basically worthless. I threw it in a closet never to be used or looked at again. Not worth the trouble to send it back. This was an impulse purchase that just did not work out for me."
3,K-Cliffs Messenger Bag,"I liked the style, but material was cheap and seams came apart in a short amount of use. I purchased two and same result, they are good for about six months."
5,Great Album,"While Taco is a one hit wonder, this is an excellent album. Something to really sing and enjoy. I highly recommend it to everyone."
1,Not Recommended,"I do not recommend this product. I get terrible reception (with all four station options), and the result is a scratchy confusing mess of music and talk radio. Perhaps it will work out of town? I will take it on my next road trip to see if I get better results in other areas."
2,Doesn't Work in NYC,"I've tested this thing in the NYC area. It does work, but you get a constant hissing sound, crackling, and sometimes reception fades. Sound quality is worse than FM, and thus defeats the purpose of playing digital media through it. I gave it 2 stars because it is a nice concept, but it doesn't work in practice. Irock, try again."
2,Shady Engineering,"A long time mp3 user, I was real excited to use this little gizmo with my car stereo. Shortly after acquiring the iRock, I had a major problem. The wires between the jack and the unit easily severed. Too difficult to splice the wires back together, the unit is now useless. I discovered this engineering flaw too late. Would not recommend it.Really disappointed. I hope they fix this flaw as the unit would create a ton of utility."
1,sound is garbled and staticky,"FM-broadcasting music from my mp3 player to any radio sounded like a great solution for listening to my music in the car and the gym. Unfortunately, THE IROCK DOESN'T WORK WELL.In the gym: I *physically put the irock on top of the radio's antenna* and the music is still garbled and full of static. It seems like for it to work, there has to be *no* other transmission on the frequency you select (and the irock only offers 4 frequencies). I'm in Boston - if you're somewhere without radio stations, maybe you'll be in luck.In the car: Most cars have their antenna integrated into the rear windshield. The irock comes with a power adapter for the cigarette lighter. Which is nice. But it doesn't let it reach to the back window! Plus, even if it did, the music would sound bad, given my experience in the gym."
5,iroc fm transmitter,This unit performs much better than any others of this type.I use one in my car to play books on cd while I am traveling and another in the home to broadcast internet radio from my computer to the radios in the house. In this way I can hear the internet broadcast on the deck while eating breakfast and not have to disconnect the computer and take it out to the deck.A word of caution: You will note that the Amazon page shows a power suppply with the iroc. The vendor did not supply the power supply with the irock. It must be purchased separately at additional cost.
2,Flawed Hardware,"simple to use, sounds good. but the input wire for the sound breaks only after a couple weeks use in the car. I sent the first one back only to have the replacement do the same thing. You need to use the lighter power supply ans the use of the internal batteries does not do it. I eventually re soldered the wires myself."
1,"Bought two, and neither lasted","It is plain and simple, I bought two of them, and neither went for more than a month. I have a Belkin now, and it is lasting me for more than a year. Don't waist your money, buy Belkin"
1,Not worth the money,"This item only has 4 channels. If you have local stations on those 4 channels, it will NOT work. The sound quality is no better than regular FM stereo, not digital as advertised on the package. And, it does not work with Satelite radio as advertised on the package. The Belkin model is a better choice considering the broader channel selection. Would not recommend buying."
2,"Has potential, but merely OK","The iRock is an interesting and reasonably effective device. It works as advertised and generally would be a reasonable buy.I travel a lot and I used to carry this device with me to different cities in my laptop bag. The design is not well thought out and does not allow for shielding of the On/Off button. As a result, the device can be inadvertantly switched on while in the bag. This is a significant problem for battery usage.I also think that the workmanship leaves a little to be desired.I have used the device for a little less than six months before the linking cable developed a small break in the wire. This left me with the alternative to throwing it out and buying another or spending the time to replace the cable.On the whole, I was not impressed. This is a frist generation device. As these devices become more pervasive their quality, design and variety will improve."
1,Engine noise filter issue,"This unit has several problems. First, it has a very limited amount of selectivity for the FM station. Second, my unit has a problem with picking up engine noise through the cigarette lighter. This manifests as a loud whirring sound when the engine is running. This sound is absent if the engine is turned off, or if you are running off the internal battery. This second problem is not present on both of my cars, which leads me to suspect that some vehicles have filters in place to prevent the problem. Battery life is nowhere near the nine hours I have seen advertised. Finally, the signal sometimes ""drifts"". I think that this is because of the mechanical tuner.I recommend this unit for in-home use. It is more of a crap shoot for use in a car"
2,"Good, when it works","I had the adapter that was just like this without the lighter adapter and it worked great. I got this new one after I lost the other. It worked well, but then the radio stations became a little stronger and now it cannot work in my cars at all."
1,Very let down,After searching for a way to play my portable cd player in my car i stumbled upon this interesting gadget. I was tired of the tapes you could use ..you always had to rewind them..well believe me i would deal with that now. It is a good idea..but just does not work that well. I spent too much money on an item that provides bad quality sound. It sounds bad..does not even sound like radio quality..and none of the stations seem to work very well. I would not reccommend this to anyone. It was a great idea but did not pan out the way i had hoped.
3,Used the older model (ie. pre 12v adapter) was alright,"I had the older model, as my title says, predating the 12v supply option. It worked great for over a year... I could get reception from 2-3 houses down or in my garage when the Irock was in the basement on the opposite side of the house... however one day when I unplugged it from my laptop... the minijack stayed in the laptop... and the wires stayed in the IROCK... not the best of situations... after that I bought a Belkin which let me TUNE the station I wanted to use from the full FM spectrum.... and included the 12v car adapter... definately an improvement and a recommendation over this.."
4,Works as promised,"I live in Minnesota, southern Twin Cities, and drive a Camery, commuting into the metro area. The product works great on 88.1, with no 'bleed in' from surrounding stations. It's not CD quality sound, but it's as good or better than the quality of any FM station. I use it to play MP3s on my iPaq. The option to use either the AAA batteries or the lighter adapter is a great touch.The only thing holding back the last star is I'd like to have seen an 'auto-off' feature to conserve the batteries. Too easy to forget to turn it off. (this isn't a problem if you use the lighter power adapter vs. batteries)Overall a very good product!"
2,"Great in theory, but...","When I first saw this little doodad, I couldn't wait to get one. Finally, I thought, I can use my XM radio and iPod in my truck. And for only $25? Turns out, though, that it's too good to be true. While I can now use both XM and iPod in the truck, the sound quality is so bad that it's not worth the hassle of setting everything up. To be fair, I live in a major city with FM stations at 88.3 and 88.9, which pretty well obstructs the useful range of the iRock. I'd say the sound quality is on par with AM radio at best. So I wasted my money...if you're going to buy one, make sure there's a free spot in the FM 88.1-88.7 range beforehand."
2,Disappointing,"After reading the reviews, I was disappointed to find that the iRock 400 gave a distorted, sibiliant, bass-light, hissy and squelchy sound. I have used this with my iRiver ihp140 and have tried a number of radios both in the car and at home. The iRiver is great, the iRock not.Anyone want to buy it?"
1,very poor,"FM transmitters of this size don't last forever. That is a fact I accept but I had hoped it would last longer than 2 weeks. I bought my first one from Target before a road trip in a uhaul without a cd player. The sound was marginal at best and by the end of the three day drive to Oregon it was extremely noisy. I plugged it in to my computer to transmit some streaming stations and it had trouble hitting the receiver (direct line of sight) no more than 40 feet away. Two more days and it crackled its last and died. I exchanged the transmitter at Target for a new one and a week and a half later I was returning that one as well. Spend a few extra bucks, save yourself the hassle and get a Belkin."
2,irock 400fm fm transmitter,This product is hampered by its' seriously limited range. The device must be w/i a foot of the FM receiver to work with any semblance of any reasonably acceptable listening standard. I must with an unequivocal clean conscience rate this product as unacceptable.
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"The irock's audio wires float loosely within it's blue connector cable. Every time it's bent, they fray a little more. Within a month of purchase, the audio started going in and out. Within two, it stopped working completely. I split the cable open and found that the audio wires had, through regular, non-abusive use, severed completely, just above the 1/8"" jack. If you're looking for a decent, long-lasting FM transmitter, look elsewhere."
5,Great,"I just bought this album from curiosity when I read a review in a greek magazine .... It turned to be one of the best metal albums I have ever had and simply the album is great and it is a shame that Metallica are more famous than this incredible band who can write legendary songs like Fuel / Long Whip / Redemption City , not to mention that all the songs are more or less great and really innovative ..........."
5,i give this album 6 stars!,i love how they combind punkish riffs with metal and i love Pepper's voice it's greatit just has all the right elements that make good albumsif you like this album i also suggest deliverance and blind because they just plainly kicks @$$
4,These Guys Are Not Pretenders,"I just received two Corrosion of Conformity CD's (""Wiseblood"" and ""America's Volume Dealer"") as gifts, having never heard of the band before, and I could not be more pleased. These guys realy rock, and they rock true to rock's roots. Both CD's are refreshingly free of over-the-top, Red Bull-fueled, rap-...-thrash that passes as rock in 2002, and are instead filled with powerful guitar riffs, intelligent and creative lyrics, and a musical quality that ties it all together. Evidently it's taken the band some time to assemble the right lineup, but it sounds to me like they got it right. This is powerful stuff."
4,More Good Stuff,"Picking up where they left off with Deliverance, C.O.C. stradle the line between stoner rock and 70's hard rock, with a little boogie thrown in for good measure. This makes for one hell of a muisical stew and an album that is rock solid from beginning to end. Guitarist/vocalist Pepper Keenan has a gift for writing about the seedy side of life full of pitfalls and exploits alike. ""Long Whip/Big America"" showcases this in pure southern style, while the almost hardcore ""Man Or Ash"" brings man's destructive nature to task. ""Redemption City"" sounds like their hit Albatross and the title track centers on a shout along chorus tailor made for audience participation. These guys just keep getting better and better."
4,"you past reviewers are retarded, learn the coc history first","let me just say im a big coc fan along with metallica... you so called coc fans that wrote a review, dont know anything about the bands history... you degrade metallica, but if you took the time to find out what coc is about you would learn that, if it wasnt for metallica coc wouldnt be around... metallica found coc and took them under there wing!!!! plus do you [*] realize that man or ash has hetfield singing, and playing guitar..... why dont you morons pull your thumb out of your ear and stick it back in your a**......"
4,Mixed Bag from a Master Raconteur,"""The King of the Night People"" spins his yarns and shares his insights in this, a wonderful collection of some of Shep's better bits.I, for one, never really ""got"" the enthusiasm over Shep's preoccupation with Orphan Annie, a cut on this CD that I personally would skip. Where this late, underrated cult figure excelled, I believe, was in his trenchant social commentary and understanding of the human psyche. Here, two riffs - one related to Role Reversal, the other to the connection between male sexuality and autos - presaged societal trends, and they really hit their mark.Shep was at his finest in the late Fifties to mid-Sixties, and this CD captures some of his better material quite nicely."
5,Tiny little bike.,"I got this for my 2yr old granddaughter, who is a tiny little thing. This bike is just perfect for her. It is the right size for her, and she loves it. Makes her feel like a big girl."
5,Poetic Schubert,"This CD, containing the less frequently played Eb Piano Sonata, D.568 and the 6 Moments musicaux, D.780, is poetic, searching and beautifully played. Unlike her recording of the D major and lesser A minor sonatas, which I felt were over-interpreted to the music's detriment, Uchida lets the music speak for itself.Highly recommended."
4,Blues greats pay tribute to SRV,"As one of the all-time great lineups of blues artists hits the stage, Stevie Ray Vaughn is remembered the way he would have wanted it; as a musician. The CD contains outrageous solo performances by these artists, but the jams at the end make this a needed addition to any blues collection. As the greatest players in the world swap leads, you really feel the joy in the performances as if Stevie's memory was bringing out the best in all of them."
4,Nicely done..,"OK. maybe B.B. King could have rehearsed more, but this is a great CD. Among the highlights are Buddy Guy, who gives the best performance of the night singing ""Long Way Home"", and a great arrangement of ""Cold Shot"" by Dr. John. The group then play ""Six Strings Down"", which is probably the highlight of the evening. This is a emotional, fitting tribute, filled with exceptional music."
4,A Tribute To Stevie Ray Vaughan,"Although the intentions were good, this CD can't possibly live up to Stevie. Don't get me wrong, this was still a good CD, but it's just not Stevie, all you SRV fans know what I mean. All in all, I still think it's worth it for the CD, but don't go in trying to listen to the music in the same way."
2,A big let down from an all-star line-up,"I was really disapointed with the sloppy performances on this album. I'm a big fan of all the musicians that were invovled, but Stevie and this album deserved a little more rehersal. Eric Clapton and Robert Cray were the only ones who sounded as if they had actually practiced the songs a few times before playing them. A much better album could have been made by local bar bands that really love this music and Stevie."
2,Starts out OK...,"and then the second half goes completely downhill.The first half is pleasant enough with its spacey, floating mood. And then the second half - they added a counter-rhythm that is really annoying. I thought it was one of my neighbors with a stereo turned up loud. But no, it was on the CD. Too bad.If you want beautiful, relaxing EM - check out Liquid Mind or Kevin Kendle."
5,The Interrupters,"The good news: violent crime in our cities has been in decline for more than a decade. The bad news: that's cold comfort to those who live in areas where violence remains prevalent. The Interrupters is the story of a group of brave men and women who are doing something about it; as ""violence interrupters,"" the members of CeaseFire attempt to defuse potentially deadly conflicts as they happen. Director Steve James, whose classic Hoop Dreams captured the difficulty of teenage hoopsters with startling intimacy and power, has delivered yet another haunting portrait of life in urban America, and even though there were many great documentaries in 2011, I think The Interupters was one 2011's best documentaries."
4,Important and informative,Impressive inspiring work by remarkable people captured respectfully through this fine documentary. I highly recommend this film for it's social awareness.
4,I understand what the guy was trying to do and I like it.,I understand what the guy was trying to do and I like it. I have tried learning this stuff on my own. I have tried scouring the Internet to find examples of how to program these machines and you know what. I still cannot do it. I am almost through the book and already I have a lot more confidence than I had before about my ability to program games. This book is helping me to understand the complete picture of what it takes to build my own games.I do not know if I am going to become a professional game programmer or not. What I do know is that I am having fun with this book and I consider it to be money well spent.
4,"The lost art of conversation, complete with her signature cuffs.","I knew of Fran before this documentary. I, like many others read Metropolitan Life, watched interviews with her and noticed photos of her while at various social/industry gatherings in New York through the years. It's all the same Fran - what you see is what you get, not one to mince words, no apologies and all the while insightful, provocative and witty. I doubt if anyone reading or listening to her comes away unaffected.The documentary was filmed primarly at a restaurant table and is interspersed with film clips of her interview with Charlie Rose, etc. The time flew by as I watched and listened to every word, including the Extras.I'm so glad Martin Scorsese thought Fran was documentary-worthy. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will again.The Fran Lebowitz ReaderThe Portable Dorothy Parker (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)"
4,Variety of ideas about silk painting,"Scarves, cushions, quilted panels, pictures, bags, umbrellas, sarongs, pictures frames, greeting cards, ties and other objects are beautifully painted on silk in this interesting book. Variety of ideas and techniques are presented and explained step by step. The cushion cover (Iznik Cushion Cover), with design inspired by the patterns on Turkish tiles, and the quilted wall hanging ""China Birds"" based on ancient Chinese bronzes, are two remarkable textiles of the book."
2,I hate nextel and this phone,I have a business acount with 8 lines.Three of my phones are the i530s. I have had nothing but problems with these phones. I have had one repaired three times. Each time I went to repair it I had to be on a waiting list because of the high level of repairs needed for this model. I would get it repaired only to have to do it again a few weeks later. Now I am having problems with another two of my phones with no reception and battery not charging. I keep spending the $35 charge for swapping them. And nextel customer service is a joke. They will not admit these phones are pieces of crap. When I call I wait for an eternity througha million automated systems before finaly reaching a person only to be transferred to someone else only to be disconnected before I reach them.
4,An Above Average Phone,"I did have the i730, but i got terrible signal strength with that. So i traded down to the i530. I love this phone. I've had great signal wherever i've gone. I live in Kentucky, so i go into city area's and rural area's but i have had no problem. i love the two way radio, saves $ on the phone bill. Also the cool GPS tracker. The phonebook holds 600 #'s, i will never fill it up. The only downfalls with this phone is the battery. I use my phone all day and i have to charge it every night, if i didnt then it would die on me the next day. also no belt clip comes with this phone. other than that i would recommend this phone to everyone, just but a car charger, it will save your life. my dad and grandfather went out and got the i530 too. Save your $, dont buy the i730, get the i530"
2,"Motorola should recall this, or remove the battery-- makes a great paperweight!","My office has numerous i530 phones that came with our contract. No person in our office has ever commented on how much they like this phone or its performance. Battery life is terrible out of the box, the interface is clunky, and our personal phones with half the bulk have at least twice the overall performance. If everything else in your life is perfect then this phone is for you-- it will give you SOMETHING to complain about. For the rest of us consider other models or other manufactures to work with your Nextel/Sprint network contract."
4,Awsome Phone... Can't Go Wrong!,"I've been using Nextel at work and all my friends have Nextel... so why not switch? This phone caught my attention because it's very rugged. Granted it's not the smallest phone out there, but its meaty design is great for a good strong grip on the phone. The i530 yellow adds a nice finish to the phone instead of having a plain ol'e black one. In my opinion some of the downfalls to this phone are, no color screen, the menu is sorrta' small and hard to read. Very small 'function' buttons (compared to the actual buttons w/the numbers). All and all very nice, though phone."
1,Why did I read this book?,"Uncomprehensible, flitters from place to place, none of the characters are likeable. I really can't believe I waisted three days on this book. Don't bother with it."
5,The reigning diva of anti-heroines!,"I loved reading this book! Katya Livingstone is an anti-heroine that you would love to hate. She chronicles her life on a day to day basis in a tabloid newspaper. She is so deluded and cruel! The readers laugh and marvel at her wit as Katya backstabs her way into Hollywood -- where a low-budget movie about her life will be filmed. There are various memorable moments. I especially liked the language the author used. I suspect that most of Katya's experiences were either lies or exaggerations of the actual experiences -- the author did this brilliantly.The only flaw I found in this gem was that Lang's writing style was similar to Helen Fielding's in Bridget Jones's Diary. This, of course, led to comparisons to the aforementioned novel. There was no need to copy Fielding's style -- whether or not it was intentional. Other than that, this is one of the best dark comedies I have read this year and I highly recommend it!"
3,Katya the snob.,"Katya Livingston I don't think there are many kind words to describe her. The first few pages of the book seem to sum her up as a stuck up brat with an ego the size of Rhode Island.When Katya finds out that she is getting audited her accountant tells her she should keep a journal of all her expenses. Well Katya doesn't just keep a journal she manages to spell out her entire life to the world and some of it isn't very pretty.As she works at the ad agency she finds more ways to cheat the company and to try and sabatage any people that she comes in contact with. But when Katya gets some news that she doesn't like she starts to change certain things in her life.Her friends in this book were annoying and at times I just wanted to strangle everyone in this book and tell them to get a life. Espically Katya..This was an ok book, not something I would read again or keep around."
1,STAY AWAY!,"Such a bad book, written in present tense, in confusing language, by an AWFUL main character. My friend warned me so I didn't waste more than an hour trying to get into it but I cannot believe anyone would recommend this book to a legion of television viewers!"
1,Terrible,"The first chapter or two were semi-entertaining, but it got very tiresome, very quick. I couldn't finish the book, I could not get into it. It was a waste of money and a waste of time. This is the first book that I have read and just had to put it down."
2,If this was funny - why didn't I laugh?,"I was looking for a light summer book with a good story and some laughs. I barely got a story and no laughs. The plot was contrived with some characters only serving a purpose to move the story along. As a character, Katya had no redeeming qualities. When good things kept happening to her, I kept routing for opposite to occur. The only reason I finished was because I held out some hope that Katya might evolve as character. Sadly, Katya was as self-centered at the end of the book as she was in the beginning. All of the other characters in the book were one dimensional....this book might be good as Lifetime movie on a rainy day and you are too lazy to go to the video store for a better movie."
2,Confession...,"Normally I thoroughly enjoy British humor and I buy loads of books. This book was almost painful to read.There is no character development and each diary entry is more shallow than the one before it. I had to reread and reread pages over and over. It was not my sense of humor, and I found the main character rather boring.Save your money, if you must read it, go to the library!"
3,A More Wicked Bridget Jones,"A book similar to Bridget Jones Diary, the novel is an accumulation of diary entries. Katya, the lead character, is remarkably unlikeable, but the novel sustains a degree of humor. Katya manages to acquire several interesting occupations, but none satisfy her. A quick read."
2,Irritating,This book to me was so irritating. The diary format was okay but I prefer chapter style. The character was so over the top I couldn't wait to finish this book just to be done with it. The character is so sick and twisted you get annoyed thinking anyone could ever get away being like that. This book to me was just...irritating.
1,"Weak, weak, weak.","Worst book I've read in a long time.I had high hopes for this book: thought it'd be like ""Absolutely Fabulous"" in book form. I mention it just so you'll know that I have no problem with unpleasant protagonists or British humor. I liked ""Bridget Jones"", too.I had to force myself through this. The tone is one of shrill forced hilarity throughout, like sitting next to a table of obnoxious drunks when you're stone-cold sober. It's positively embarassing to witness an author straining so mightily to be clever, and failing so completely. Every line turns somersaults trying to be all zany and outrageous -- but they just fall flat.Barely even a smirk, let alone a belly laugh. Don't waste your time. Read Joe Keenan's ""Blue Heaven"" instead."
2,"Blend on ""low"", three minutes...","This book reads as though some halfwit editor put pages from previous chick lit bestsellers in a blender, pressed ""frappe"" and published the results.Actually, that's not quite right. What it really reads as is a far less charming knockoff of the Shopaholic series. I think someone needs a copyright attorney, stat.I got less than halfway through before I realized the book had no plot, was filled with unpleasant or uninteresting characters, and was a big fat waste of my waning summer vacation. I desperately encourage you to read something else. The side of the Wheaties box, maybe."
2,About 100 pages too long!,"This book had its funny moments - Mainly at the beginning. However, the further one reads the clearer it becomes that the same 3 jokes are being repeated over and over and over again. She drinks...A lot! She worries about not having sex...a lot! She abuses and takes advantage of everyone around her.... a lot! What I had hoped would be a quick and fun read quickly turns to tedium. I would suggest buying this book for a flight that is going to take several hours ...but once you're done with the flight you should know that there is no point in reading any further..you've gotten some laughs and really have covered every aspect of the character that you're going to learn..even if you do sludge through the rest of the story."
2,funny but no heart,"the title character Katya was just hate-able. I did not feel anythign for her, and she was very funny, but really a nasty .....It was a quick read, thankfully.Just left a bad taste in my mouth. Mean for the sake of being mean."
1,Only because there's nothing lower than 1 star,This is one of the most [boring book] I ever tried to read. I couldn't take any more than the first 25 pages. I would like to set it on fire...that would be about the only thing that would make this nasty little piece of work interesting. I regret spending any money on this book. It's not good enough to give away...they should pay people to take it.
1,Save your money! I'm so disappointed!,"After being endorsed by Cosmo, I told my book club that we HAD to read this book. To make a long story short, they swear they will NEVER let me pick another one!Katya Livingston is the most conceited, dull, and flat character I have ever had the displeasure of reading. I truly struggled to get through the first few chapters of the book hoping it would get better, yet it simply did not. For me, a good book is centered around a strong main character, and there is nothing about Katya that is even remotely likable.To be honest, I put this book back on my shelf unfinished."
3,"surprisingly enjoyable, but not worth keeping....","I liked this book. I enjoyed hating the narrator and I loved the ways in which she got her come-uppance over and over again, and never seemed to learn from it. Adele Lang managed something interesting by keeping Katya in character throughout the entire book. It was refreshing to read a book that did not have a predictable ending, and where the bad guys were not redeemed.On the other hand, this book is a one-trick pony. There is exactly one thing going on in it, and if it had been even one page longer, I expect I would have gotten tired of it. Moreover, I found I had no desire ever to read it again. Since I was in Manila when I read it, I declined to offer it space in my suitcase on the way home.If you like this kind of thing, then you will like this book. It's done extremely well here. However, it's all taste and no substance. Which may be the point, I suppose. Still, I was ultimately disappointed."
1,"Hoping for reform, instead disappointed","It's sad to think of a world with people like Katya Livingston in it. Without morals or a sense of guilt she wreaks havoc on every person she encounters. With friends like her, who needs enemies? I kept hoping something would happen to cause her to ""see the light"" and change her ways, but alas, it never did. Still I kept reading with the hopes that Katya would develop some scruples. The only relief I experienced was when I threw the book against the wall in frustration that I spent good hours of my life reading this garbage."
1,"""Social Disgust""","This is without doubt ""THE WORST BOOK OF THE YEAR"" in my opinion, give me a break! I can not believe that I am even wasting time writing a review of the damn thing! Do yourself a favor and skip all of Kelly Ripa's picks are you'll live to regret it. You have been warned!..."
2,Not as good as Kelly's 1st pick ...,"Kelly Ripa steered me in the wrong direction on her second book club selection. She said she picked it because of the cover - perhaps she should have different criteria next time.I was bored with this book and there was no one likeable or interesting in it - just a bunch of whiners.This is a weak Bridget Jones knock-off.Oh, well better luck next time."
1,If this is a Reading with Ripa selection ...,"I hate to see the books she doesn't like.Confessions of a sociopathic social climber is a horrible book. The idea for the story isn't original, since every other book I've seen these days is about a British 20-something keeping a diary, but I bought the book because it sounded like it took an old idea to a new level.I was wrong, [the cost] wrong.Katya isn't a likable character. She isn't even the type of character we love to hate. She is self-centered, obnoxious, untalented, and thinks WAY TOO MUCH of herself -- and those are her ENDEARING traits.I can't even summarize the plot because there wasn't one. Katya just complained and moaned and was generally [uncool] for about 200 pages. I have never been so glad to see a book end.Don't buy this book in hardback. Don't buy it in paperback. We don't want to make it look like people like this book and find a Katya Livingston Chronicles Part 2 on bookshelves next summer!"
2,"Some crass fun, but a seriously flawed humorous novel","If you want to thrill vicariously to the wicked thoughts of a caricature shallow English career woman, this book has some good chuckles. Men are humiliated, women rivals are defeated, friends and family are exploited and cast aside, cute little animals are thoughtlessly murdered, and all business contacts are left to wallow in failure.The trouble is the thing has no plot, none of the characters are remotely sympathetic or believable, and it's just too darned long. As a result, it's funny enough for the first few chapters, but there's a point where you realize it's just going to meander and repeat similar gags forever. Even if you like this sort of crass humor, you look to see how much longer you have to go and wonder if you should bother to finish it. Would have been great as a short story or novelette."
2,Check it out at the library,"Honestly, this book isn't worth buying, but if you feel that you must read it, support your local library and get it there.I loved the idea of the book and was hooked from the back cover description, but tired of it after about page four.The character, as she is supposed to be, is a narcisstic bitch, and stays true to form through the entire book. That seems to be the reason why it's so dull. There is no character growth, no change throughout, nor even an interesting story line to the book.The reviews on the book claimed it to be ""a quick afternoon read"" but it took me nearly 3 weeks to force myself through. I kept putting it down for more interesting books before I finally just made myself finish it.I wanted to love it, but I just couldn't."
1,This book was awful....,Everypage was about the same thing. And if this was at all about the author and her life I feel bad for her. The main character does awful and pointless things. The whole book was a waste of my time.
1,I would give it -5 if I could figure out how.,Save your money!! This book isn't the least bit funny. I bought it because Kelly Ripa said it was hilarious. Thinking it would get funny at some point - I plowed all the way through. It is a good concept - the musings of a woman who couldn't care less what people thought about her and would be willing to climb on the backs of the people she stabbed in the back. After all how else would one climb the social ladder???!!! Turns out that I couldn't care less about this woman's whining and lack of ability to hold down a job. The concept really could have been funny. It sounded like a career girl's version of THE BROKE DIARIES but bears no resemblance. Save your money. Don't waste your time.
1,Glad I Got This Used...,"....because I'd be pretty upset if I had paid full-price for this drivel. I like a fluffy Brit-chick book as well as anyone, but this is clearly the work of someone who had a friend in the publishing business. While the character is certainly biting and at times humorous in her self-centeredness, the story goes nowhere. There is no learning or change in the character, no progression in relationships, and very little satisfaction when the book is done, except that it is DONE."
3,"Funny, Fluffy, Mean-Spirited, Goofy","This is cheesy light reading and it doesn't try to pretend it's anything else. In my view that makes it even more likable. This is a comedic record of the life of a deeply flawed, fantasy-prone, sociopathic woman in the business world whose ambition and willingness to do anything, sell out any friend, rival or co-worker, flatter any boss or hatch any plot to get ahead is the darkly funny antidote to the increasingly silly misadventures of a certain diarist named Jones. Should I be ashamed to admit I read this because Kelly Ripa said it was her favorite book ever? Ha, I don't care, cause this little novel made me laugh!"
3,Escape to a Shallow World,"Written in diary form. Here is an author of humor and wit, who creates a character of epic shallow, back-stabbing, hateful proportions. Katya Livingston believes in working as little as possible, has no true friends, sleeps around and has a nemesis in Sebastian, the boss's nephew. I laughed out loud several times but wished there was just a little more conflict with Sebastian. I was disappointed in the ending, but never-the-less, enjoyed this book and am grateful I do not work with any Katyas."
5,Sleek and beautiful,A medium face on this lady's watch--not too big or too small--just right. No superfluous dials that are not needed. A second hand is a nice addition to a lady's watch. A beautiful shiny stainless steel band. The selling point for me is the push button clasp that saves on the manicure. I refuse to buy a watch with the jewelry clasp. The four diamonds make the streamlined watch a bit special. A watch I can wear for every occasion--dressy to everyday.
5,The pleasure of reading while sharpening your eyesmto the beautynofmwonder.,"I was gifted with this book by my brother in law. It was chance but the way he went throguh the very first pages figuring I would quickly like it. He was not only right, but also provided me withnthe art of writing of Julian Spalding, the way he gets you into a new perpsctive of seeing through simplicity and joy. Everyone who might be traveling through this marvelous book would change the way he or she will see the world of art, a way not experienced before."
2,What's missing?,"The book is good but lacking a few things for me. I've read many books on Soul discovery, while I enjoy the information about the soul's reincarnation and how we are all somewhat connected. I was disappointed that in giving information about the natal chart it did not cover the planets Venus,Uranus, Jupiter and Moon. Through other outlets I found out that I have Venus in Taurus,Uranus in Libra, Moon and Jupiter in Scorpio; with list of attributes that correspond with them. I would have love some additional information about those from the book. It only covers Neptune, Mercury, Mars, Saturn and Pluto. The title is ""Discovering your soul's mission"" I did not feel that I discovered my mission because the book does not give any concrete guidelines about how to do that either. For this reason I am rating the book 2 stars."
4,Great <3,"The CD is in great condition, the album artwork, and the CD are like new! The case is a little worn, and has sticky resudo from a sticker, but thats okay, I can always get a new case.The Album is great too, I love all the remixes, this has to be one of my favorite Madonna songs. :)"
3,Madonna is still the master,"It is rare indeed that the original 'album' version of a song is superior than the mixes from renowned djs whose work comes weeks or months later. Most of the mixes (on cd singles) that stemmed from ""Music"" and ""American Life"" were superior than the original versions. They were freshly reinterpreted and a bit more polished as danceable tracks making most of the original edits somewhat forgettable.But I must say that the original versions of each track on ""Confessions"" leave little room for improvement. ""Sorry"" is no different and are only slight variations from each other and the album edit. I enjoy this cd thoroughly but found little need to look beyond the original."
3,One more item of your OCD,"Another addition of your obssessive compulsive disordered urge to Madam M's remixed collection, only the frenze is a bit higher this season with her disco diva re-invention.The best track goes to Paul Oakenfold's, vibrant enough as a wake-up mid-track after the disappointing Pet Shop Boys' maxi-mix - a rather ""minimal"" remix.Just good enough for the next 2 weeks as my sit-up's play at home."
4,another great dance track from the Queen,"This was the logical follow-up single to Hung Up. Another great beat from the Dancing Queen. I hear this and I'm on my feet in an instant. The mixes are not bad for this song, some are better than others of course. I think the Pet Shop Boys mix is probably the best."
3,Interesting tracks but craptacular recording quality,"I am a big fan of the tracks on this disc as far a cheesy dance goes, but the levels are all out of whack. There is clipping in a few of the tracks that make the disc pretty unbearable. Its kind of sad because the even the vinyl version has the same recording issues. I was hoping the CD would be better."
2,I'm not feeling it,"I usually buy Madonna's maxi singles without hearing them simply because there's bound to be at least a few remixes I end up liking. But this, to me, is just a poor choice for a single to begin with, and the remixes I have heard....what can I say...I'm just not feeling this one. The PSB mix is flat and thin, sucking what little energy the orignal had right out it. And the Oakenfold mix is just so obviously his - I knew it after about 20 seconds when I heard it on the radio. His remixes have an unmistakable sound, much like Junior Vasquez mixes, and often use what sounds like the same rhythm tracks and drum fills. The bottom line - remixes should make me want to go straight to the dancefloor, and these just make me want to head to the bar. AVOID."
2,Don't waste your money,"Unless you REALLY like the song and are an avid Madonna collector, pass on the single for Sorry. The original is great, but it's already on the album, so track 1 is almost worthless. Track 2 and 3 are good, but it goes downhill from there. Track 6 is horrible. I'm listening to it now, and its not a dance mix.If you want a good single, turn to Hung Up. And if you can find an inexpensive copy of Sorry, give it a try, but don't waste your money."
1,"Vicki, Mom",Bought this for my daughter for Christmas - worked all of ten minutes! The ten minutes it did work she really seemed to enjoy it. Too bad the quality is just not there.
2,CRAPPY PICTURE QUALITY,"I HAVE THE ORIGINAL VHS VERSIONS OF BOTH SERIALS, AND WAS HOPING FORIMPROVED PICTURE QUALITY....WRONG.THE PICTURE QUALITY IN BOTH SERIALS IS JUST NOT GOOD.SAVE YOUR DOUGH AND GET A BOOTLEG."
1,The Dud of Steel,"Don't let the positive reviews fool you. The ""Superman"" serials are poorly made and not even good for laughs. Kirk Alyn looks OK as the Man of Steel, but gives a rather cheesy performance. I'll stick with George Reeves."
1,"The ""Cartoon"" Superman","I grew up with ""Superman"" serials on Saturdays at our local theater. It was great to watch Kirk Alyn change into a cartoon and fly through the air to rescue Lois Lane or stop some bad guys from some sinister deeds. I guess back in those days they did not have the special affects that we have now. I still wish I had gotten his autograph for my collection."
3,looks good,looks good . I have the old VHS tapes it would be nice to see clear pictures. It says color...but is it?????
4,Superman Serials,"Quality from WB excellent. Unfortunately, in the Superman serial (1948), they omitted the titles from the start of each chapter after the first one. Their master is probably this way since I have the serial on VHS and it is the same. Otherwise OK. Atom Man vs. Superman is great in all respects (for a Columbia serial)."
1,"Christmas, Easter, and Sunday keeping are not biblcial","For all the religious rhetoric in justifying what is not biblical, the annual celebration of Jesus birth, resurrection, and keeping Sunday are nowhere to be found instructed in the Bible. Nor are the also pagan notions of immortal soul, going to heaven (when you don't die), and a triune Godhead.Those who observe this unbiblical package of paganism do not practice the religion instructed in the Bible, nor do they represent the one and only religion of the Creator God, contained in it.I believe anyone writting about the religion of the Bible should first read it, then if they believe contrary to it, disclose that and admit to a theology that has its origins elsewhere."
5,One of the best!,"I did not expect this to be such a great book, and only picked it up as I am familiar with the SF Bay Area. What a surprise! I am a true-crime book afficiondo, and this is one of the best books I've ever read. It takes the reader through each event in an easy-to-follow format, and it was difficult for me to put this book down. A very sad story, very touching, brought tears to my eyes at the end. Presents both the police standpoint and victim/parent standpoint in a compelling manner, making me have so much sympathy for the victim/parents' frustration, yet believing the police did all that they could at the time. A must read book--I found it at my library in paperback."
3,"Interesting Story, But Mundane Reading","Jon Dunkle appeared to be a mild-mannered, if slightly mentally-challenged boy.But lurking behind the facade lay a monster who struggled with his sexual identity and preyed upon little boys.The question that still remains however is whether Dunkle's mental incapacities lead him to be a killer.Gretchen Brinck, author of The Boy Next Door details Dunkle's crimes as well as discusses his mental state as a defense.While I found it to be an interesting, albeit heartbreaking, story, Brinck's writing left a lot to be desired; written in a cut-and-dry style reminiscent of reading boring Court documents.And I was disappointed that there appeared to be no effort on Brinck's part to think outside the box by interview friends, neighbors, etc. Everything found in this book is straight from Court records and newspaper accounts.It's an okay read, but not one I would recommend putting at the top of your list."
4,relives the story,"very good insight on the story of John Dunkle, accurate and those wanting some closure on what happened in our town of Belmont, I recommend it"
2,do not buy Kindle version,"I listened to Dr. Curtis on KERA public radio when he was at Unity Church of Dallas. This little book has some good information for visual mediation. It is not his best, however if you can devote an hour or more a day to his ideas it does work. If I were functioning well enough to do that I could use it. Not the best book to bring you out a funky place as it may make you feel more like a loser."
2,Won't Play on my system,Was made for older windows systems and won't play correctly. Very old graphics etc - I should have done more research !
3,tin cup,thought the music in the movie was great.. but just to listen to it was just ok..still very enjoyable though
1,The Worst of Its Kind,"Say It Isn't So! Tell me I didn't waste 95 mins of my life watching this DVD! I think I had pretty realistic expectations going in that Say It Isn't So wasn't going to be anything exceptional and I do normally enjoy the sick Farley Brother sense of humor, but Say It Isn't So is so painfully un-funny that it's hard to believe it ever made it past its first test screening. You'd think with actors like Heather Graham, Chris Klein, and Sally Field, you'd have at least a semi-watchable movie, but there couldn't be anything further from the truth! Say It Isn't So is one of those movies that is so bad in just the wrong way that it isn't even laughable as a bad movie. ... If you're looking for a good gross-out comedy I'd recommend some of the Farley Brother's other endeavors, including the much-overlooked Kingpin or even Dumb and Dumber. [Geoffrey Kleinman DVDTalk.com]"
1,Stupid stupid stupid...,"I don't really know how to put my hatred of this movie into words. It was THE worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I have seen a lot of bad movies in my time, but this really takes the cake. I don't think I would even wish this movie upon my worst enimy, that would be too cruel. I didn't laugh once watching this movie, it just left me shaking my head in awe of how really horible it was. Please save yourself from torture, and skip watching this excuse for a movie."
4,Cute little offbeat romance.,"I guess I'm admitting to a guilty pleasure, but I liked this quirky little romance. It was a veritable roller-coaster ride of plot twists to delight any connosieur of zany ribald irreverent comedy. And the romantic mix is a plus. To say much more would give crucial twists away, so I won't. All I'll add, is isn't Heather Graham a marvel? She makes me wonder if she was cryogenically frozen for a decade or more. Until recently I'd known of her only from LICENSE TO DRIVE back in the late eighties or so. She was or looked like a teenager then. Nowadays she reappears in this and AUSTIN POWERS THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, still looking like a teenager and never loosing a beat with her acting ability and charm. As for her looks, I've heard of Oil of Olay, but this is ridiculous. Where has she been all this time? I hope she keeps up her good work and I see her in more movies soon."
5,It is a excelent movie,"This movie is funny,romantic and even though it's rated r I still enjoy it.It's a good movie.Ithink that if under 17 or 18 you still should see it."
5,sweeest out of all the farelly brothers flicks,i actually thought of not renting this after i saw me myself & irene which was the crudest and rudest comedy i had ever seen. it was actually a sweet romantic comedy with a whole bunch of good actors and actresses including the two wonderful together chris klein and the incredibly cute heather graham. the funniest part was when the dad got covered with bees.
3,"Say, It's...OK","What can you say about a comedy that tackles incest, stroke victims, paraplegics, and mental illness? Not very much. It isn't that the film is that offensive it just doesn't mine the material for very many laughs. I give the flick a marginal pass for the engaging performances by Chris Klein, Heather Gtraham, and Orlando Jones(the 7-Up pitchman). If you're looking for a comedy that tackles incest with more wit and substance check out ""A Very Brady Sequel""."
5,Good for a laugh,"This movie is funny. Is it a classic? No. But good for a laugh from a person who is in need of putting the brain in neutral and laughing at visual and adult sexual material (not hard core). A person taking themselves very seriously would not enjoy this video, but someone with a sense of humor and open mind will laugh out loud at the antics."
4,Hilarious!!,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It's, by far, not a Disney movie. It's not a movie you'd expect to get nominated for any awards. Maybe that's why I found it so amusing and fun to watch. It's just a funny, feel-good movie. It doesn't make you sit and wonder what the plot was or what the writer was trying to portray...it's just plain fun. It's sort of like Dirty Dancing...you want to watch it over and over and over again."
5,best cpmedy of the year!,"so far fromalltdoes moviesz i'z seen this year, say it wasn't so iz the best comedy i'z seen this yeesr. i'm willing to bvet that it will make almost every flick critic's top ten list. it'z soooo wonderful and heather grahm is beauitiful. where did she come form?? she wil get an oscar nomination for this film. watch it and u waon;t be able tos top laughing."
3,Say It Isn't So Professional Review,Blockbuster hit Say It Isn't So! is an underated film. For one its theatrical release was a very short period of time. Secondly it got aweful reviews but to get down to the real perspective of the film its a good one. The movie starts out a little slow and not very funny but throughout the rest of the film the ludacrisniss of it just makes you laugh like you have in Austin Powers 2 or even American Pie. 3 Stars for good but it would of been four stars if it wasnt for the slow beginning
2,have better things to do,"bad acting, bad script. makes you want to reach up and slap the main guy character. I definitely wasted a couple hours of my life."
1,I actually paid $ for this piece of trash.,"Dear Friends,I voted for Al Gore, I attended an event with Tipper as a speaker. I spent money on his campaign in my home area and donated to his national campaign during the primaries. I looked forward to his book and bought it early.The book is boooorrrriiiiiiinnnnnngggggggggggggggggggg. Its theme is anti nuclear family and if their ideas were taken to their logical conclusion you would find public endorsement of gay adoption, which I could support, polygamy, multiple spouses, marriage between adults and children, marriages between brothers and sisters, mothers and sons, fathers and daughters and grandchildren game for everyone.I now regret my vote for him and wish there was a way to get my money and time back. President Bush now looks like a hero with both morality and leadership.Why wasn't the press able to expose his depravity before the election? It would have saved some of us who supported him from this embarrassment."
1,This Bull ... Ranks Up There With This ---->,The photo of Tipper wasted...playing the drums after Al lost.And...the photo in People magazine of Clarence Thomas & his wife reading the bible....after being accused of sexual advances by Anita B...i forget her name.Complete ... !!!
1,Al Gore,"I would say don't give up your day job, but I really don't know what his day job is nowadays. Certainly not an author nor a president."
1,A second-rate book,"I just finished reading this book. It is about 4990 on the Amazon sales list for good reason. Although I want to assume the best in an author's desire to cogently express a point of view, this waste of paper (my God, they have another book that I hear is just as poorly conceived, out simultaneously with this one!)cements Al Gore and Tipper as nothing more than political opportunists trying to manuever their political ship into a congenial harbor.Those that believe Al Gore no matter what may like it, most everyone else will gift this book to some relative they dislike for Christmas. To think, all of the trees that were killed by BIG PUBLISHERS to print this....where are the environmentalists when you need them?"
1,Joined at the Heart,Not bad...but I enjoyed the other Al Gore book--At Any Cost: How Al Gore Tried To Steal the Election better.
1,tipper was tippsy and al was fuzzy,"Can't sleep, don't read this - it is so pathetic that even gore supporters will be embarassed... The premise is that we (you, me, our parents-children-grandparents-friends-etc can learn something from tipper and al about life. gore ... have hit the big time with this one - they are the ... . Yes, sure al wants the democrats to beg him to run for president in 2004 and this book is meant to present a jimmy carter like image (read that as: i am a great person, a meaningful person, an humanitarian.. really, i am honest and caring - please love me)... and by the way, the love of my life, tipper my wife, is a really, really significant person too, please love her too.anyway, this book is not worth the recycled paper it was created on....enjoy"
1,Al Gore is his own worst enemy,"Seriously, this guy comes out with his ridiculous speeches, tried to steal the last election (but was defeated thank God) and now wants to talk about values???? C'mon. I guess Bill Clinton's book on moral values and strong fidelity comes out next right?I flipped through the book at our book store. There were plenty of copies. No from big rush from anyone to buy it.Al, you did it to yourself guy."
1,"Confusing, very dissorganized","This book jumps around so much that I feel that I am playing hopscotch. It's a classic case of throw some spaghetti against the way and hopefully some of it will stick. Gore seems to be desperately trying to grab at anythingto get the reders hooked...but alas, Gore fails terribly."
1,Its pathetic,Why did he bother to write it: it's a pathetic piece of writing (too political) and he's not even running for president.So glad HE'S not president.
1,I'm glad it was a gift...not worth the money.,"I read the book with an open mind, but in the end, I could not escape the conclusion that politicians do not make the best sociologists. As for organization and logical presentation of materials - It was not stellar and there was way too much political drivel and platform pushing to really qualify the book as a resource about family. On a side note, I was surprised to learn that a book claiming to be an all encompassing book about family did not refer to, quote or use any information from Dr. James Dobson from Focus on the Family. Seems he meets all the requirements as an expert on the family. The book was just too political for my leisure time reading."
1,Washed-up has been writes book...,"First he invents the internet, and now he writes a book. If you thought his first book was out there, you really won't believe this one!!"
3,The Original German-Language Version,"A remarkably good homage to Fritz Lang's legendary crime thrillers, ""The Return of Dr. Mabuse"" (1961) is fast-moving escapism with atmospheric set pieces and evocative postwar German locations. Though he lacks the master filmmaker's subtlety and restraint, director Harald Reinl effectively recreates Lang's cinematic world. Gert Fröbe makes a terrific Inspector Lohmann - a role he would reprise in the 1962 ""Testament of Dr. Mabuse."" Wonderfully eccentric jazz-rock music from composer Peter Sandloff. The best of the post-Lang ""Mabuse"" sequels."
3,Not for Kids,"This book contains some interesting lists and is what I call ""bathroom literature."" Much of the content, however, is NOT suitable for young children. I purchased this for my seven year old grandson, but I decided to give it to his dad instead. I don't understand why they wrote this for kids!"
1,Junk,"Intercepts the MAF signal and makes the ECU think it needs to modify fuel flow. After a few minutes, the ECU figures it out, and restores correct settings. Save your money. At best, you just waste your money; at worse, you can damage your vehicle."
1,waited to review - glad I did,"The electronic timer with battery back up concept is ideal. If only the product/timer continued to perform. It is Sep 2012. We ordered these timers Nov 2011. One by one now, they are failing. From not working at all to working as long as they are plugged to a wall outlet, the timers are failing. Do not buy these! They WILL fail."
3,"Works well, except for 2 issues...","The product works well...though it appears to have a weird issue.I noticed that when I was programming the units (held in hands) and touched the electrical prongs, the unit would reset or go into a weird state. I don't know why... Perhaps they are meant to be programmed while in an electrical socket...(?)Also the units do not appear to work with dimmers that I have for many of the lamps around the house.Otherwise they appear to be pretty good units."
3,Good Timer-Junk Batteries,I ordered 6 of these. 5 worked and one was DOA. The timer is simple enough to setup and use but the included batteries on every one failed within a week. Get quality batteries when you initially set these timers up. I would rate it 4 stars if it came with decent batteries.
1,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to using this product, however, I had to return it. The led readout was difficult to read, so it was impossible to set the timer. The problem was that the numbers all had shadows -every number looked like it could be 2 or 3 other numbers. I tried new batteries, used the reset, held it at all different angles and numbers were still unclear. This may have been a defective unit. I did not order a replacement. Still looking for another brand of digital timer."
4,Very handy,"Very handy device. Easily set once you have done it the first time. Only drawback the screen is hard to read in a dim light, and requires a flashlight if no light is shining on it."
3,Digital Timer for Lamps,Setup relatively easy with option to over-ride auto timer settings. First timer sent was defective. New timer sent quickly to replace old and works fine.
1,"I thought this would be easy, but.............","From the day I received this timer, I had difficulty with it. Originally, I thought it sounded like a great product and easy to read. Yes it is easy to read. However I had great difficulty programming the timer. At first, I thought I was doing it incorrectly. But, what worked one time, didn't work the next time using the the same procedure and instructions.I would never buy this product again nor reccomend it to my friends. I even hesitate to buy anything similar, especially if made by Sylvania. Now I have it over two, possibly 3 years and it had stopped working 6 months ago."
1,Impossible to set up and use,"Bought two of these timers thinking that they might be easier to use than the ones with levers. They are not -- we have yet to be able to get one to work properly. I am computer literate (have been using them since 1986) and my husband is a retired general contractor who could build houses, swimming pools, buildings, etc. This timer has brought us nothing but trouble. If you are a programming genius, perhaps it will work for you!"
1,Worked fine for 9 months - then died,"I used this timer for 9 months and was very happy with it. Then, upon returning from a vacation, found that it hadn't been working while I was gone. The display was messed up and I couldn't get it operating again for more than a day. I need a timer that I can rely on when traveling. This one is going in the trash."
1,poorly made,2 of the three ordered either did not work out of the box or stopped working soon after being plugged in. nice features on the one that did work but poorly made.
3,Not bad. Hoped for better.,"This device is simply the digital equivalent of the old manual type of light timer. You get an on and off time that is the same every day. True, there are two programs, but you can only run one or both at a time. So you are still stuck with lights coming on at one or two times, same every day. A better timer would randomly turn lights on and off at different times of the night, (some do this, but aren't ""smart enough"" to stay off during daylight hours). Another reasonable option would be to be offer a different time setting for each day of the week, so that the lights would not come on at exactly the same time every night. Anyway, I guess I should have read the description more closely. I hope this review makes the situation with this device clearer to YOU!"
3,Works but not made well...,"I have two of these timers, and while they do work reliably, the backup battery feature has a major glitch. Because the battery holder is not made properly, you actually have to back the battery out of it's slot a fraction of an inch, or the entire unit will not work. I have this problem on both units, and again, while they do work, I have to be careful not to push the battery in all the way, or the unit shots down completely. Another great idea, born in the USA, and screwed up via lousy Chinese manufacturing & QA."
5,As Good As Advertised,"I purchased 3 of these units after having no success with other brands purchased at the large hardware stores. I've had them plugged in for about 3 weeks with no failures. I recommend these units because they are reliable and not complicated. The timer only allows two off and on times to be set. That works out great if you are like me; need one to come on before sun rise and one setting to come on after sun down. Others had as many as 8 different off and on settings, but, that was of no value since they didn't work. These timers also have two power outlets; one timed and the other works all the time (as a pass-thru). I did not see any of the hardware store variety where you can plug switched and unswitched devices in. The best timer I've run across (after trying many others - and returning them)."
2,Parts missing,"Don't rely on getting batteries with your timer(s). I ordered 3, but only 2 came with the promised batteries. Also, the lifetime warrenty isn't worth much -- you'll pay as much in postage each way to cover the cost of a new unit. This is definitely a case where buying local would have been better -- I could have taken a timer back to a real store for replacement by a timer with batteries."
3,GOOD ITEM SLOW SHIPPING DELIVERY,IT CAME TOO LATE TO USE WHILE I WAS ON VACATION BUT WILL BE GREAT NEXT YEAR
1,Did not work with IBM T21,I was told and read many times that PC133 would work in my IBM Thinkpad T21 model 2647 but it did not. It is a completely different size so please don't make the same costly mistake I did.
3,Very Narrow Focus but interesting,"The movie follows the lives of 4 specific women with eating disorder in a eating disorder recovery center. The story is told in a bit of a vacuum in terms of statistics, origins, etc., on eating disorders. None were offered, which took away from the impact of the movie. Still, the story itself was interesting, albeit bleak."
3,sad,A very good documentary. Quite sad when one of them died though (after the documentary was shown.)
4,worth watching,this is a good documentary. it mostly shows life inside an inpatient treatment program for girls with eating disorders. the story seems incomplete and leaves you wanting more. i was struck by how lost and immature these girls seem to be. the documentary focuses mostly on the efforts made to keep these girls alive. it would be nice to have follow-up with the girls to see what types of enlightenment or insight helped save their lives.
4,"Not what I expected, but good","I was told this would be devastating and triggering to me, a 10-year sufferer of eating disorders, but it seemed mellow. I liked the fact that it was a documentary not a made-for-tv-movie. This is real-life. It won't get fixed in 90 minutes. Relapse happens, life gets in the way. It is a long journey to recovery, and I think this shows it. I could really relate since much of it-treatment and all the people-reminded me of my own hospital stays in California."
4,"Excellent, easy to use drug reference.","I have used this book in my office for over 10 years! Both medical and non-medical readers will find information easy to find (drugs are listed in index by BOTH generic AND trade name)as well as very informative regarding action, side effects, dosage,interactions and special considerations. Non-medical readers will NOT get lost in a flurry of pharmocological and medical terms...thank goodness!James J. Leonardo, MSPT"
2,"Not so new, not so special...","I had expected to have this book for quite some time, and was quite surprised when I read it. Far from being a tremendous amount of ""new"" scenery tips, it only offered SOME good pieces of advice for modeling special features like snow or ocean beaches. Otherwise, it lists techniques that have been used for years now for making trees and other mountains (actually other techniques not listed here give far better results)... No, nothing really new and a bitter taste when I closed the book. Overall printing quality is great as can be expected from Kalmbach Publishing, but for those of you that have read Model Railroader magazine for 4 years or more, the purchase is not necessary... Do I sound disappointed? I am indeed!"
3,Very high level book - Definitely not an Architecture book,"(-) Don't set big expectations on this book especially if you are looking for defining a Web services architecture.(-) Does not address the Webservices implementation complexities especially Transactions, Security, Interoperability etc. (I WAS LOOKING FOR IT)(+) This book is full of high level content if you want to know the basic story of Web services and where you can apply them."
5,Great Information on Web Services,"This book is a great collection of papers on Web Services, and cover various topics. If you are involved in Web Services in any way, then you must read this book.Its a high level, overview of different topics related to Web Services. It also has case studies for Web Services in the Financial, Supply Chain and Real Estate verticals.Overall a great introduction and overview of Web Services - without the hype and the ""silver bullet"" treatment that Web Services seems to be getting."
5,A must-have for every parent!!,"As a new mother I want to pray for my child and yet found that my prayers were often repetitive and felt ""empty."" I know God hears all prayers but this book has helped to put new life in my prayers for my child. It has helped me to be focused and specific in my prayers. It also helps me recall and claim the promises of scripture as I pray for my child."
2,Pain in the .....to install,"I usually like Belkin products. I think they have good products for the money. In this case they use a strange size hex nut for the screw that holds the wire. I have a 14 piece Allen wrench set and not one of them fit the screw properly. It took me way to long to install these. There are a million speaker pins out there. I would recommend some that use a regular small flat head, which is the norm.YattaB"
2,It's ok,"This offical guide was ok, but ti didn't have specific maps and I couldn't go throgh some of the dongeons. I perfer Versus Books."
5,The Best Game Ever Made! (One of the Best Books Too!),"This book is the best! Naturally, it would have to be to go with the best game ever made! This does not tell you everything, but it shouldn't. If it did, what would be the point in playing the game? Anyway, this was a great help to me while playing the game."
4,Good Purchase,"One of the strategy guides came in worse shape than the other. Since they were gifts I can't tell you which one, but my son enjoys using the guide."
3,Everything is not revealed,"As in the title, the book does not reveal everything. The Ice Arrows require a small quest and it isn't covered at all. The Ice Arrows are useless in this game but everything is not revealed.It is hard to read without a very bright light source.Overall though, it does get you through the game with a minimum of problems so I give it a 3. 1 point off for false advertising and 1 point off for being hard to read."
3,"Best zelda guide even,NOT!!!!!!",this guide does not use helpful maps and it dosen't give it's best effort in gold skulluta hunting either.but it still gives good descripions of the dungen even though i tought they could do better.if you want a helpfull guide don't chose this one.buy prima's or versus's.i liked the secerts though.the price was good to.only [$$] even though most guides are [$$]. don't waste your your money on it.good job on the item pictures.i disagre with the number of shields of some emimes in the sheild section.it dosen't even any thing on the gerudo training groud.not a good guide.
4,Pretty Good,"Well, fairly nice maps, detailed, and very nearly complete. It's got info on all of the mini-games, and locations of various items, such as heart pieces and Gold Skulltulas. The descriptions of some of the stuff in it could be a little more detailed, though."
3,I can realy get further NOT!!!!!!!!!,"Well I can't get further on the trail up to the volcano!I don't know how to get past the boulders.If.....I had the guide, it would do a lot of help.I rememberd that I had a dream a long time ago that was just like princess Zelda had."
4,Just about Everything you Need,"Taken as a whole this was one of the better game guides I have used. It contains all of the necessary information for you to finish the game as well as hints for almost all of the side quests. The only thing I found fault with was the omission of any tips for the Gerudo Training Ground where you are trying to aquire the ice arrows. This omission did frustrate me I have to admit, but all of the other mini-games and side quests are covered. An adequate book that satisfies most needs."
1,Worst Guide ever,"Talk about everything revealed. Not only does this guide have terrible descriptions, misleading maps, and other things, it doesn't tell you where everything is. This is frustrating when you try to get 100 skulltulas and it gives you 56! I don't care how much you love bradygames, you've never used a guide by this author. Do not be fooled by those other reviews. Trust me, they haven't ever looked at the guide. JUST DON'T GET THIS GUIDE!!!"
3,Wouldn't Recommend It,"I preordered the Wind Waker for Gamecube and recieve the Ocarina of Time for free. I bought this guide from Amazon because it was the only one available. I should have looked elsewhere. This guide is only helpful in the dungeon walkthroughs. It doesn't provide enough details into finding the Gold Skulltulas or the Heart Pieces. If you need a guide for this game, look for the one by Versus Books."
2,Not that great,"This book didn't totally..., but pretty close. The text is black andis printed on a dark background making it almost impossible to readw/o a bright light source. There are no maps that are of any use, andthe instructions are the only good part. The pictures are pretty...,and on the whole the book has a poor and pretty boring layout."
3,Confusing,"This is one of the worst strategy guides I've ever encountered. The occasional inaccuracy is to be expected, but the lack of detail, not to mention maps, is ridiculous. The walk-through is bare bones only. Don't expect any cheats or much help, only the bare minimum of where to go. The artwork is lovely, but the print is hard to read, the lists don't tell you much, and they don't have any dungeon maps. The list of golden skultula locations only covers about half of them and the ocarina song list doesn't actually give you the notes, only a description of what each song does. I ended up going online and downloading the walk-through from the LOZ site. No pics or maps, but it was more accurate and detailed than this guide!"
3,"Cold War ""Testament""","An intriguing update of Fritz Lang's 1933 masterpiece. Gert Fröbe returns as Inspector Lohmann in this supernatural crime thriller - with Wolfgang Preiss' evil genius receiving more screen time for a change. Director Werner Klingler makes the most of a low budget while creating a fast-paced noir style in the Cold War era. The 1962 ""Testament of Dr. Mabuse"" cannot hold a candle to the Lang original, but is fairly entertaining on its own merits."
5,Excellent Book,"Jack shared his experience in a most colorful and real way, even though it must have been tough. God bless our troops."
2,monotinous,"I expected a moving, uplifting harmonic experience that I would take along with me as I drive around Sedona. Sorry! This is a seemingly one-note, very long, droning effort. BOOOORING!"
1,Does not compare to the original,"As we all know, this release of ""In Times Before The Light"" is a re-issued version of the original recording. The original version of this album is incredible. I am lucky enough to own a copy. The reason they re-issued the album is because they shared the same name as a band from Sweden. Beacuase of this they were forced to change their name to The Kovenant. After the name changed, unfortunately so did the bands sound. This not being a good change at all. If you do ever get to hear / own a copy of the original Black Metal version, listen to that rather than this. As another reviewer stated, the whole atmoshpere of the original recording has been lost. The album doesn't feel the same."
1,Piece of junk,This is a remake of the first Kovenant (or Covenant as they were called back then) album.This album .... Plain and simple. The first version was a true black metal album and this version is not. I thought that Lex Icon and the other were smarter than to destroy the only good kovenant (or Covenant) album .
3,Color is not as it appears,"The couch is cute and our son loves it. But I got it to match our other furniture. We ordered the olive green or so we thought..When it came, it was forest green. It looks nothing like the picture colorwise. The fabric is polyester and cheap. But its for a kid..so its fine. Quality-wise, I am not sure its worth $139. Fortunately it was on sale when i bought it. It is a great size for our 14 month old though."
4,a bit small,"really cute, really durable, just wish it was a little bigger...seats two 2- or 3- year olds nicely, but not really meant for kids much older than that."
4,"Great couch, but they sent me the wrong color","I got this couch for my 16 month old and the couch itself is great. It's the perfect size for him and I loved the fact that it even came with the little pillows. However I ordered the dark green and they sent me the dark blue. Since it was for Christmas and I got it on the 21st, I didn't have time to exchange it nor did I want to deal with the exchange process. So it was a big disappointment there. So my conclusion is:Pros: Cute, looks very comfortable, looks well put togetherCons: sent wrong color"
2,Plesea look at the details of the sofa b4 you buy it. Not for adults dont make the same mistake i did,I am a 20 year old male and I got this sofa to put in my room so i can have something more comfortable to sit on when i watch movies or play xobx. But to my surprise this is not for adults maybe if you are 2ft tall and weigh about 30 pounds but i should have looked at the specifics b4 i bought the sofa. But i guess it would be ok for a small child but for the price you may as well get them a themed couch like Cars or Transformers or Disney princess or something.
4,Nice kiddie couch,"This couch seems to be very durable. It is on a smaller side, but a petite adult and a 2 year old can fit in it. The fabric is a cheap polyester, so that's the only thing i don't like about this couch. Overall it's nice and good addition to a child's room."
4,A New Talent Emerges,"I think ""the next Stevie Ray Vaughan"" label ought to be put to rest. I say that despite the fact that it almost always persaudes me to take a chance on buying an album. You add that to the fact that ""True To Yourself"" features Jim Gaines in the producer's chair and Tommy Shannon on bass and I couldn't live without it. Before I ever heard it. Fortunately, Albert delivers the goods. The New Englander proves you don't have to be from Austin to play the Texas blues. There's still a little something missing that doesn't make him the ""second coming"". Maybe that's because there should be only one Stevie Ray. It sure isn't the guitar playing which alternately roars into high gear and then does a slow, soulful burn. This truly is the emergence of a major talent. An extraordinary release."
4,Bound for Greatness,"The first time I gave Albert Cummings a listen I was'nt sure what all the hype was about.Sure he can sing,and he can deffinitly shread the strings right off his guitar,but there was something that just did'nt hit me down to the bone like I was expecting after reading the rave reveiws.So the CD sat on the shelf for a couple days untill I had another chance to really listen.What can you really say about this Guitar player that can't be said much better by giving yourself the chance to sit and listen to him play for you.Here is someone who is here to stay and will and is headed for who knows how far givin the talent and soul he gives to his guitar playing.You will not be disapointed with this CD if you like the blues drivin on home with the flavor of SRV,Joe Bonamasa,Johnny Lang and Kenny Wayne only to bring something even more to the show on his own.And the man can Sing too!!!"
5,A Sonic Assault,"I am lending this CD to the local beauty salon to curl women's hair. This isn't music in so much as it is a full-frontal guitar assault. Blistering, soulful, fire-spouting guitar playing. This cat may just be the new, fastest, greasy guitar slinger on the block. Buy this CD and drive vermin of all ilks away from your property. I am writing the Department of Defense and recommend they play this CD at extreme volumes while flying over Taliban strongholds instead of dropping laser-guided bombs on them."
5,This guy is the Goods.,"When Walter Trout came onto the scene, it was like WOW! Sadly, it seems that Walter has run out of ideas. I am new to Albert Cummings music, and was introduced to his sounds by Internet Blues Radio.That WOW! factor hit me again for the first time in about 15years. The mix of great blues guitar and strong powerful vocals is a rarity these days, but Albert has both in abundance. I also have Working Man and From the Heart, but True to Yourself is definitely the Albert Cummings CD to start with. Hey, the other CDs are great too, but this one is hard to top.Hopefully, I will get round to the other CD (The Long Way).An absolutely amazing album from start to finish."
1,Terrible product!,This is a terrible product. Provides NO support for your feet and the foam is made out of such a cheep material that your feel start sweating instantly. DO NOT BUY!!!
1,bad gift idea,"I got these as a gift for someone that is on thier feet all day. They bunched up in thier shoes and were thrown away within the first week. I feel bad that they did not like the gift,"
3,Its ok,This product was very slender for a man size and slides around in the shoe. I ended up putting them in a different shoe than I initially intended.
2,memory foam insoles,"hard to cut to size. a ""hard"" memory foam--not pliable and comfortable. not worth even the 8. cost. money wasted"
2,Drives us crazy.,"Yes it has lots of buttons and, of course, balls for kids to throw around and lose, but we (the parents) hate this thing. The sounds and music are so annoying we had to get rid of it. The voice just sounds weird too. And it's not like the kids really took advantage of all the buttons and stuff. They just liked that it was a helicopter.Just our luck our second kid received another one as a gift. Now we have to disappear the second one too. Don't waste your money. There are so many other things out there."
4,Educational and fun for hours,"My son got this for his 1st year birthday and he learned in a few days how to play with it. The balls are a little hard to get through onto the hole at the top of the helicopter but nothing little 1-year-old hands can't manage. He knows where the balls belong and he may have them all over the place during at times but he always manages to get all 4 balls back into the helicopter, not losing a single one. He has fun with this toy for hours, putting the balls in and out back and forth, learning about the colors and the numbers and he especially loves dancing to the music and turning the helicopter fan."
2,One of our son's most annoying toys,"This little helicopter drove me crazy. It is really loud and the songs/phrases are annoying. Balls are hard to push through. For the play value he got out of it, it just wasn't worth it to me. I was happy to pass this one on."
3,Not as fun as we thought it would be.,"I brought this toy home for my 9 month old twins and they didn't really seem interested. I don't understand why the balls don't do anything more interesting. The description says that there is a door release for the balls and that's quite a stretch. It's also very hard to understand the words being said. I'm so glad I only paid $4, and even that was more money than I think this toy is worth. I have 5 children and in my motherly opinion your money would be better spent on something else."
2,super annoying,"I don't know why but this toy is super annoying. My 16 month old son loves it but my husband and I hate it-I think it's the voice and the music. It was a gift however from someone who comes over regularly, so we can't get rid of it. It has a lot to entertain the kid, we just find it irritating!"
3,Lasted less than two months,"We bought this for our 16 month old grandson for Christmas. It quit working mid February. Thinking it was the batteries, I replaced them but still didn't work. Great toy, grandson played with it frequently but it was not abused. Disappointed it quit so early in its life."
4,Enjoys the balls and pull along string.,Recieved this for Xmas for my 16 mo. old. He loves the colorful balls that come with it and putting them back into the copter. The sounds and singing are fun too but he really likes dragging it on the pullstring behind him which wasn't something I expected.
2,There Are Better Toys,"My daughter wanted to play with the balls more than the actual helicopter. There are better toys out there in my opinion that hold a child's attention better. I also found this one to be annoying because you can't shut it off manually. It's one of those that shuts off when you aren't playing with it, but it was always randomly going off at night and scaring my kids."
4,Fun toy- many ways to play,"My son received this for his first birthday, it was an instant hit! He plays with this a little bit every day, he enjoys pushing the balls through the top of the toy. I like it too because the music isn't bad and the toy balls store nicely inside the toy. He is now 19 months old and has discovered he can pull this toy behind him with the attached string. Great toy for a good price."
4,Son Pulls away,"My son loves his new helicopter. He is still getting use to putting in the balls in, he pretty much tosses the balls around. Great purchase."
2,I'd skip it,"My 1st child got this as a gift for his 1st birthday. He LOVED to push the balls through it, but he didn't like it for long when it was turned on. It is TOO loud. I thought about tossing it quite a few times, but I thought I'd give it another chance with our 2nd child. The 10 month old baby loves this thing. It drives me CRAAAAAZY, so I now decided to keep it turned off. He still loves it...so I think it's the colors and design that attract him. He loves grabbing and throwing the balls. Oh, and yes, the balls of this toy are some of the first ""toys"" he ever played with. The colors drew his attention. So, though we will be keeping this toy, I would never recommend it to anyone.. but I would recommend buying some colored balls with no batteries needed :o)"
2,cannot recommend,"I can't really think of any reason to recommend his toy to other parents. The volume is very loud and there doesn't seem to be any value to most of the things that it says. One opening for the balls is on the side of the helicopter so that knocking it over sends the balls rolling around the house. It's one of the few toys we have that can make a mess even when no one is playing with it. Maybe our ""exit door"" is missing? I'm not sure; I've not seen a picture of how the other side of the toy should look. The toy does teach a few concepts but mostly what sticks in my head is the annoying music. In addition, my kids don't enjoy playing with it. I recommend you skip this toy."
4,Vtech Explore and Learn Helicopter,"My 8.5 month old loves this toy! He's still a little young for the ""educational"" aspects of this toy, but he loves playing with the balls and dancing to the music. My only compliant is that the string is WAY too long to give to an infant!! It must be 24"" long! Long enough for my son to easily swallow it with plenty of slack. I tied up the string, so there is no chance of my son swallowing it and choking."
1,Annoying toy,"Like many reviewers my son loves this toy, but I hate it and it makes my husband crazy. Our helicopter is stuck on the sound of the rotors and the voice is like fingernails on a chalkboard. As far as educational, my husband gets upset because balloons and kites wouldn't be at the same elevation as a helicopter and bears aren't blue. Funny enough my son is napping and as I am typing this the stupid thing came on with no one within 20 feet of it. Unless you are a very patient person I wouldn't buy this toy."
2,"Not That Interesting, SUPER Annoying","Not only does my daughter not really like this toy very much, it also is probably one of the most annoying ones she has. The music and voice drives me crazy. She doesn't really play with it at all, she just turns it on to hear the music and then walks away to play with her other toys or read her books. If I turn on my music for her, she completely ignores this toy. I think its time to donate it."
3,My daughter loves this toy but.....,It truly is one of the most annoying toys. No volume control. The songs and voice are really annoying as well. It never shuts up even when she has left it alone for minutes. I don't know if it's very educational or good for development. But she seems to love it so that's the only good part about this toy.
5,Great baby toy,"I got this for my son for his 2nd Christmas, he had just turned one. I wish I had gotten it for him sooner so he could have gotten a little more use out of it. He loved it. It makes lots of noises which he loves. Every time you put a ball in the top the toy tells you what color was put in. It has a string on the front which allows for baby's and toddlers to pull it around... Not sure why they like to do that but they do, lol. I also have had younger babies over and they have enjoyed it also."
4,My Son loves it!,"He enjoys rotating the helicopter blades, and pushing the balls through the hole on the top. The only real complaints i have is it plays noise randomly a lot.... (aka when no one is anywhere near it) and it takes quite a lot of force to push the balls through for a 10 month old. When he gets a little older that will probably change though."
1,Waste of money,"Typically this toy broke the day after the returns date expired. It is stuck on saying A for Apple and one tone or a dog barking. If left on it will make only the one noise every 10 seconds, so annoying!! If you press any other button it will only repeat A for Apple.My son was not interested in this toy so was not played with much, and it still broke!! With absolutely little to no use from a 1 year old. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of useless garbage!!"
5,Another great V-tech toy,"My 7 month old loves this toy. It has many different buttons, etc. to keep her busy. Even her older siblings will ""help"" her play with it."
1,Sooo loud and abnoxious!,"My son received this for his first birthday. This is seriously the LOUDEST toy that we own. There is no volume control. The music/voice is annoying. We ended up putting duct tape over the speaker the try to quiet it down a little. I don't know what Vtech was thinking!!It has some okay educational features, but I can't stand to listen to this toy for very long. There are plenty of other toys out there with the same or better educational features -- buy one of them and save your sanity."
1,Can not be used with a Carpent Pencil,"The tile on this product is ""CH Hanson 02001 Pro-Sharp TM Finishing Pencil Carpenter"" which implies you can use with a carpenter pencil. The hole on the sharpener is too small for a carpenter pencil. I bought the plastic pencil sharpener for carpenter pencils and it did not take long to sharpen the pencil."
3,CH HANSON PRO-SHARP,THE REASON I GAVE IT A 3 STAR IS DO TO THE SHARPENER IS NOW MADE IN CHINA. I JUST BOUGHT THE 15 PENCILS AND SHARPENER FROM LOWES AND LOOK ON THE PACKAGE AND IT SAYS PENCILS MADE IN USA AND THE SHARPENER MADE IN CHINA. I HAVE AN OLDER ONE AND THIS ONE IS FOR MY SON. I WISH THAT WE WOULD TAKE BACK MAKING TOOLS AND OTHER THINGS IN THE USA. WE MAKE THINGS TO LAST!!!
3,drill mounted pencil sharpener,"I thought this drill mounted pencil sharpener was a great idea. However, with only a 1/4"" dia PLASTIC shaft, it is pretty wimpy. The first one we got broke before we got the four supplied pencils sharpened. We were given a replacement, which is holding up, so far.CH Hanson 02001 Pro-SharpTM Finishing Pencil Carpenter"
5,"Simple, but Ingenius Product","What a great Idea. A co-worker had one of these on a jobsite, and as soon as I got home, I started looking for it on the internet. The shapener works great. Wheather it's in your cordless drill or your holding in your hand. It has a really sharp and durable blade, that lasts a long time. At first I was not happy with having to to buy the shapener and pencils together, but now that I've used the pencils, I really like them. They're ideal for the type of carpentry work that I do."
3,Will not sharpen colored pencils!!,"I rated this a ""3"" so people would read why. This sharpener is absolutely fantastic and would have gotten a 5 star rating from me except for the fact that it completely obliterates colored pencils. When we first got it my little boy went and grabbed all of his colored pencils and eagerly stuck them in the sharpener only to see it continually break the lead. The colored pencils have larger sized lead in them and the angle of the sharpener just continues to break the lead apart and it just eats the pencil. So you'll have an 8 inch pencil that will be 2 inches and it never gets sharpened. So here's the deal....it's a fantastic little tool if you only need it for #2 pencils and I give my endorsement for that job.....fully."
2,Dinosaur Science kit,This product was a great disappointment. It was impossible for a young child to do. It was even difficult for adults to do. It took much patience and strength. I would not recommend purchasing it for a child unless perhaps a teenager. I have never been so disappointed in a gift for a child and even felt like writing to ask for my money back.
4,Good for learning,Something I picked up for my son who enjoys Dinosaurs and at the same time educate him. Something to think about when you buy your children toys is to make it enjoyable and educate them at the same time.
5,Great Gift for 5 Year Old,I bought this as a gift for my 5 year old nephew. He is a very curious kid and loved this Dino Kit! I would recommend it for any kid that loves to discover things!
4,Exciting all through the whole book!,"The book is real intriguing and very exciting to follow till the end. It shows the author's in-depth research and knowledge about what really happened during the World War II in South East Asia, its geography and culture. It is a good mixture between a historical piece and a fiction! A Thai reader can read a Thai version too. Good translation."
2,KJ,"While I suppose the story is good, the book is written at a seventh grade reading level. Maybe this is okay if English is not your first language (or if you happen to be 13 years old). Should make for a good movie."
5,Wonderful Indeed,When I was a little boy I got this set for Christmas one year...and I'm glad to see this amazing set is still available for fans of Oz to enough still!! It's very simple indeed--just cut and glue each character together.! Many famous Oz characters are included to inhabit this 3-D Emerald City...fans of the books will definately recognize each one! A definate treat!
5,Oh I Can Tell If A Thing Is Wick!,"I had the privilege of preforming in The Secret Garden in my high school in March of 2008! I must say this is the most amazing musical I have ever been part of! I played Dickon and loved every second of bringing my part to life on stage with the help of such breathtaking songs such as ""Wick"" and ""Winters On The Wing""Now my school did the Original Broadway Show. Our show was word for word what you would have seen on stage when it first opened on Broadway. It had all the original songs such as ""Show Me The Key"" and ""House On The Hill""But after hearing the Original Broadway Cast so much during our production it was great to hear a New cast and new things added for this London version of The Secret Garden! So I would have to say I really like this London cast. Yes the Original Broadway Cast is still Amazing But, I know the show so well I enjoy both!I must say Dickon drives me crazy in the London cast a bit but, only because I had grown up with the Broadway Dickon!"
2,Original Australian 1995 Recording Better...,"Quast's performance on the 1995 Australian cast recording of ""The Secret Garden"" seems somewhat richer, yet his performance here lacks some vigour.The Australian recording, with Anthony Warlow, Phillip Quast (recently seen in Melbourne Theatre Company's ""The Goat, or Who is Sylvia?"" by Edward Albee) and Marina Prior (recently seen in the professional Australian production of ""Noises Off"" at the Comedy Theatre, Melbourne) are all outstanding. Though the voices on this CD do not allow the score to be fully appreciated.The Australian production played to capacity houses in Melbourne at the State Theatre, Victorian Arts Centre in 1995."
4,nice design.... for a cat UNDER 15 pounds,"I purchased this harness for my cat Howie, who weighs about 14 pounds. It's a good snug (but not to snug) fit for him, but would not work for a cat bigger than him. I extended the larger loop that fits over his body all the way. The swivel works well to keep his leash from becoming tangled, and the black oval piece that sits at the top over his shoulders does not seems to interfere with his mobility. I got him used to it by throwing a few treats for him, and within a few minutes he seemed to forget that he was wearing it. I gave this a four star rating because there is no sizing information available on Amazon."
3,Works good for what it is.,"For being an 8 loop shape, It works good. Both cats were able to slip out of it fairly quickly the first time I put the harness on having fitted it snugly. Snug isn't good enough. It has to be on very tight to be effective (particularly around the shoulders/ abdomen). Do that and it works wonderfully. Getting either cat to walk was impossible though. They would both rather be choked and dragged across gravel (at a very slow speed) than get up and walk along with me. They just don't get it like a dog does. I wouldn't waste my money if I were you!"
4,"My cat hates this thing, but it does its job",As soon as I put this thing on my cat just slumps to the floor and refuses to move. I even open the door which normally makes him make a dash to get outside and nothing. Oh well guess my cat isn't the walking type. This thing does hold him well enough. He wouldn't be able to slip out of it and it doesn't hurt him.
2,think twice,"unit came on time , but im so sorry i baught this item it is made of cheep plastic, it fell apart before i finished puting it on the walli took a chance and thaught it would be ok,but not in this case i lost out! it would not deflect the heat all the way i took my drimell and sanded it in the corners and noticed it was just bad construction. the idea is good just needs a lot of adjustments its a good thing i do have a background in repairing broken things ,but if you dont know how to repair things dont get it!!!!!"
5,"Excellent Book, Very Insightful",I gave this book to a grieving friend and they've shared it with members of their family. It's helped them a lot to understand what they are going through.
1,received wrong product,hireceived product in early december (but it was dvd not the book). I returned to sender and have written two comments but no response.please send me the book as previously ordered and paid for express postage and it has been nearly 30 days and I am not very impressedthanksdaimah
5,"I Wasn't Ready to Say Goodbye: Surviving, Coping and Healing",A close friend had an unexpected death in her family. Ms Noel and Dr Blair's book has given my insight on how to best help her and her family. It is a godsend and anyone who has close friends or family should read this book. The healing process will be much faster for my friend and I now possess the knowledge I need to deal with a sudden loss. It was an excellent read for a topic that is so difficult to talk about and that not alot of imformation is available.
3,Losing a Son1,"I lost my 19 year old Son March 2007....I've been reading every book I can get my hands on to try and cope, or get some relief...this book did help, I guess we'll never know the REAL answer, but it gave me a little peace and understanding of my own feelings, finding out my grief was ""normal""...thank you to the author"
2,READ THE 3-STAR REVIEWS,"I highly recommend reading the thoughtful reviews of people who did not give this book the highest rating. Beautiful title, beautiful cover, but the first story (told by the second author because she's got the PhD?) is about her own sudden loss of a wonderful man, father of her son, a ""dear friend and loving co-parent"" whom she adored so profoundly she had long ago divorced him! I was angry because I bought the book to try to help a 51-year-old in Blackpool, England (divorce capital of the UK - 80%!) who'd suddenly lost his wife of 32 years. He suffered so terribly we almost envied him - we knew it had been one of the rarest of marriages, but now we could see, raw and exposed, the beating heart in the phrase ""the love of one's life."" Trying to take the book seriously, I could imagine profound, life-long grief for the author's little boy, but only dollar signs for his divorcee mother. (The other author's story is more believable.)"
2,Not all that great.,"Personally I didn't find this book helpfull. I think it would be a great book for people who know someone experiencing the loss of a love one, to read. However the book didn't help me at all in terms of grief. While it does tell you about the stages you may go through and what you may experience, it doesn't focus enough on personal growth ( which i believe is exteremly important after an experience like this)."
2,Bad Editing,"Noel's and Blair's book actually had some unique features that I thought would be helpful as a new widow, but the many errors in editing, grammar, spelling, and organization were distracting and, after a while, offensive to me, considering the subject matter."
5,I Wasn't Ready to Say Goodbye...,This book is currently helping my mom deal with her feelings after the death of my dad a few months back. She picks it up almost every morning before she starts her day. It helps her to understand her feelings and realize that she is 'normal' in her grief. I highly recommend it.
3,Mostly helpful,This book offers helpful resources from other authors. What I was hoping for was a little more depth exploring grief (stages?) and constructive ideas for how to help yourself and others. The editorial errors mentioned in other reviews were only mildly distracting. This book probably provided an outlet for the two authors.
3,"Works Okay, cloth cover is easily destroyed","I bought this for my dogs outside. I don't think it registers for my smaller dog (she weighs 10lbs.) My bigger dog laid on it some, but also chewed up the cheap cloth piece. They also say not to put anything like straw or cloth over the heater. Something to think about."
3,Returned,"Good for some animals but very hard for most pets. Since you cannot put a softer cover on top of the thin mat provided, it just wasn't what I was looking for."
1,Product Melted - Destroyed Sofa - Fire Hazard,Length:: 1:06 MinsSee attached video. Product melted and fused to my sofa. Burned a nearby cushion. Absolutely do not buy. Product is a severe fire hazard.Notice how it's a heating device yet doesn't have a GFI plug?
1,Hot to the touch,I had one of these out side in dog house for feral cats and couldnt figure out why they were sleeping in box below where this was...it was so hot it had bubbled and cover stuck to it...so hot I couldnt touch it and scared me really bad....I am hearing other reviews on this....
1,Small Pet warmer,This is my first review and felt it necessary to comment on the product. This warmer is no suitable for puppies. The thin fleece mat is secured by 4 flimsey elastic cords. So Disappointed -- sorry I ordered it and it is going back. Not Recommended
3,It works,"The heater unit itself is well designed, and functions excellently. The armored cord is also well designed. The Fleece cover is kind of thin and doesn't stay on the unit well. Overall, a functional unit."
5,best book in the series!!!!!!!,"Elizabeth peters is an amazing writer I have loved all of her Amelia Peabody mysteries. I look forward to more. This is for sure the best book in the entire series. The great ""re-love"" story and the surprising ending is fantastic. I would sugest that you read the other books in her series. So as to get the full effect of this book. I would encurage everyone who is into Egypt and Mysteries to read this series. sincerely, a very devoted reader"
4,She's still the best,"Although I felt this book was a little slow in getting off the ground, it might be due to the fact that this was the first Peters book I had read, and it took me some time to adjust to her form of writing. In the end, I have to say, ""Bravo"" to Ms. Peters, for she is a giantess among women mystery writers, and her style equals that of Agatha Christie. Amelia Peabody is undaunted, unfazed, and gutsy- exactly the kind of woman all girls want to be."
5,A welcome return to the style of the first books,"Thank God! The emphasis is back on Amelia and Emerson and this book is much in the style of the very first. There is humour, romance and adventure, and thankfully they left the kids at home. I did love Ramses' letters (why did he grow up and get serious?) and the part where he writes about being rescued by Nefret is hilarious. This is one of the best."
4,Another entertaining atcheological adventure,Elizabeth Peters does it again. If you like mysteries and learning about Egyptian history you will enjoy this.Like het other novels she masterfully combines both.
4,Great one!,"At first I was disappointed that Ramses was absent but the letters this boy sends to his parents more than made up for it. Ramses is one of the best characters in the series and he's what keeps me coming back for more. I normally dislike both Amelia and Emerson but in this book I actually grew fond of Amelia and wished her husband would go away so that she could upgrade to a better romantic partner. I was highly disgruntled with the ending and disappointed in Amelia for her lack of gratitude both before and after ""the"" discovery. In the end I went back to disliking Amelia again and believing that Amelia and Emerson really belong together. Though I wish for better protagonists, this book was exciting, humorous, sentimental, romantic, and just good fun. Even if I may dislike Amelia and her spouse, at least I have Ramses to cheer on! I really do miss Sethos - a great antagonist that one."
2,It is NOT Amelie,I bought this video sight unseen based on how much I loved Amelie. It is slow and boring. It has none of the charm of Amelie. Buy the Dinner Game instead.
3,A weird dystopian film,"There is not much humor, but I guess there wouldn't be much room for it anyway in this dystopian world, where a decrepit building is inhabited by a butcher who will seek out human meat, a family getting hungrier, a nice young woman who falls for the new fix-it guy, who is a former circus clown; and other odd denizens.Those who appreciate satire and a grim look at the future with a glimmer of hope will appreciate this."
4,"""Delicatessen"" movie review","""Delicatessen"" is a French cult classic. It's a bit of a morbid story with cute little twists. The characters are neat (interesting developments). There is a romance or two. I saw the movie when it first came out and it made an impression on me then and it still does today. It's cute and creepy at the same time. Jean-Claude Dreyfus as the butcher was superb. Try it out! French language with English subtitles makes it easier to understand."
4,"Dark,dark,comedy, great for a weekend afternoon.",The French seem to be really good at making imaginitive dark comedies. Like the Lost City of Children and Delicatessan. Watch it when you have plenty of time and aren't in a hurry or thinking about something else. Great for a lazy weekend afternoon.
3,il est peut-tre moi,"As the title states, maybe it's me. I really liked Amelie and A Very Long Engagement, but I just didn't find this movie that entertaining. I could not connect with any of the actors. Not sure what else to say.I love black comedy, I don't need to be spoon fed the story, but man, this movie was out there.So lesson learned: Take my own advice and rent the movie first. At the most it was a watchable film, but not one I'd add to my collection."
