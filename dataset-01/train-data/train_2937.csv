3,"Looks good, but...","It is well built.But it couldn't give out much sound. I bought Nady Center Stage Microphone at the same time. Nady is much cheaper, but gives out much louder sound."
5,Some people must be deaf,"I can't believe everyone dissing ""I Can't Let Go"" the best song on the album. There's nothing, NOTHING wrong with sharing the vocals with a great singer like Mike Finnegan!"
4,Good item -- but overpriced on Amazon,"I needed bright flourescent lighting in my garage that would not interfere with a nearby radio I use primarily on the AM band. Because flourescent fixtures are notorious for the interference they inflict on nearby electronic devices, I contacted Simkar with a few questions. I was eventually forwarded to an Engineer who said these particular units were designed to give minimal interference in a residence. I was surprised how well they performed! I have three installed directly over my radio and there is no change in radio reception/quality. In addition, the instant start ballast is great -- no flickering.I did not buy these lights through Amazon, but wanted to post a review because, quite frankly, I'm shocked by the price Amazon's vendor lists these units at -- $50. I bought 3 of the exact same Simkar model at the Lowes down the street for $32/ea."
1,dissappointing,"I'm a huge Johnny Guitar Watson Fan, and have performed his music for the last 25 years on various gigs. I never got to see him live unfortunately and hoped this would capture some of what I heard on records. The Tempos are rediculously too fast, like some of the coked out versions of the 80's and 90's. Sometimes performers as they get older, think they have to speed everythig up to please younger audiences, but in the process they lose the funk.A bit too jive chitlin' circuit slick for me. JGW is one of greatest blues guitar players of the last 60 years, and he only plays on one song on this DVD. We are grateful for European Television for getting some rare footage of the masters of the blues, something American Television never gave a shot at. I'm anxious to check out his Ohne filter performance, a show I performed on with Long John Baldry in the 90's, that really shows off what an artist is about."
3,Pure Blues,"This is The Hogs when they were nothin' but the blues. It's a far cry from the refinement and expansion of their style that is yet to come. It's a bare bones live to 4 track recording that's very much alive, punchy and in your face.It's also the only appearance of blues harp player Steve Rye as a member of the band, who contributes two songs that feature him on lead vocals.It's not their most creative or essential outing,(Thank Christ For The Bomb is the best one to start your collection with) but is definitely of interest to fans who own their other releases and those who like the pure blues of acts like Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac and the early Yardbirds. More like a 3 1/2 actually."
1,"SHE'S PRETTY, BUT SHE SLEEPS ALOT","Leon (Michael Harris) and Rodney (Randy Clarke)are two young men who want money, but don't want jobs. Whatever money they can get hold of, the spend at a strip club, going so far as taking in their change jar. Rather than get a job to pay for their habit, they opt to start their own strip club in Rodney's parent's garage irregardless of any licensing or zoning issues. Rodney's parents are charging him for rent and every meal. Leon has gambling debts.They hold auditions and get four slightly handicapped women apply for the jobs. One has Tourettes Syndrome, one has a wooden leg, one has a voice box and another is narcoleptic. The acting was bad from beginning to end. The film is cheesy and is designed to be cheesy. In spite of that, it failed to deliver one good laugh. Not worth watching or reviewing. I'm sorry I did both.Parental Guide: F-bomb, n-word, adult rap language, ample nudity,"
4,Low budget but funny,If you are into low budget hood comedies than this is for you. This funnier than some of the big budget movie I've seen this year. Don't go in expecting great acting and you'll find your self laughing a lot at this movie.
5,Excellent,"I don't see how people can not like this CD. I mean, obviously, you probably don't want to start with this if you've just bought Play or 18 and now you want to venture into Moby's past - if that's what you want, I reccomend you look at Everything Is Wrong. But a prequel to Play this ain't.What it IS, however, is a bunch of GREAT songs, including the original Go (which everyone seems to hate except me), UHF3 (which features great early 90's piano); Voodoo Child, one of my favorite Moby songs of all time, as well as other quirks like Move the Colors and Permanent Green... even M-Four, the last track, is a great album ender. Highly recommended."
4,Apprentice Moby,"The music on this album may not be as complex or as polished as that on 'Moby' but it's a rich seam of early techno-period Moby tracks that you probably haven't heard before. My favourite tracks are Besame and UHF 4 mainly because they have the piano riffs (or whetever they're called) in them. A lot of the tracks could be seen as prequels the tracks on 'Moby' (Go Original Mix is an interesting listen) and Moby's learning curve can be heard when comparing these tracks to the ones on 'Moby'. The bottom line is, if you liked 'Moby' you'll like this."
4,hit hard,"as the provocative dance/techno movement has swept accross the world like a wild fire,moby has been there every time."
4,"Fluffy story and style, just like Charmin","I loved this book when it first hit the shelves and when I rediscovered it three years later. It is a fluffy book about a young female advertising exec, Sasha, whose boyfriend just left her. Writing advertising copy throughout the book, Sasha sums up life's offerings with equally pithy philosophies. She writes lovably bad song-jingles about bathroom cleaners and life's more serious(?)issues. Making light of one's predicaments and forging on armed with humor is what I liked best about Salmansohn's book. A predictable ending, least liked"
5,Tha Mile High City Can't Be Faded!!!,Yet another tight album out of the bak streetz of tha Mile High City...Nyke Loc comes tight on every trak of this album...Hiz laid bak style of spittin game iz bet with perfect beatz and nice hookz...Nothin but that Mile High game for ya trunk...If you don't got this or anything else comin out of Denver your slipp-n...We fint to run thangz...
4,Best James Brown that isn't James Brown,"I loved ""Funky Nassau"" from beginning to end, but it wasn't until some time went by that I realized that these guys sound a whole lot like James Brown. The singer's tone, his mannerisms, the lean, chopping rhythm guitar, the funky drummer, even the song nomenclature (""Part 1, Part 2"") all recall the great JB. If you like middle period James Brown be sure to check these guys out. I don't know if JB ever covered ""Funky Nassau"" but if he didn't he should have, since it's one of the best James Brown songs ever."
2,$15.00 overpriced for a copy,"i understand remastering to enhance the sound quality but,when i ordered the cd, the price was so elevated that i assumed,(silly me), everything would be an original product however,in all honesty the provider did offer,i repeat did offer me a return option, i just did'nt want to pay a cost in time and treasure for a return,so i smolder,pout and rue the purchase. ty blue"
3,Battle of San Pietro,"Nice Documentary/video. Great for it's time but lacking by today's standards. Many scenes are reversed in the movie. Major flaw from the editors. Easily seen as the charging handles for rifles and sub guns are on the wrong side. It was a simpler time, did anyone notice back then?"
3,Nice costume!,Bought this costume for my son. It was quickly delivered and was exactly what I was looking for. Good quality.
1,don't buy,"This product seemed ideal at first. However, after a short time,(a few months) the coiled cord that connects the irrigation wand with the water receptacle began getting kinks in it. At first it was just one place, and I could try to straighten and hold that kink with one hand and use the irrigator with the other hand. However, now it kinks in a number of places and is virtually unusable. At this point I've had it less than a year and it's headed for the trash."
1,Leaky is putting it gently,"Like other postings here, I too experienced excessive leaking from the bottom of the unit. More water comes out of the bottom then out of the pik. This is JUNK! Don't even waste your time buying it... you will be back to the store returning it!"
1,Ditto - don't waste your time or money,I wished I'd read the reviews before I bought this item. My unit also leaked out the base the first time I used it and had very little water pressure. Guess you get what you pay for.
2,"Unit leaks first time, everytime","I've used other HoMedics products and the price was right. Unfortunately, the unit wasn't. Read the instructions but no matter what I did, the unit leaked out of the base and hardly any pressure was going to the handle. After a couple of tries, returned it the next day and got a WaterPik 70W Family unit.This WaterPik unit is really compact and easy to use. I've had it about a month now and it's worked great.I would've given the Homedics unit 1 star except it had a nice tip about keeping the tips clean by soaking them in denture cleaner."
3,An invisible Man,Product was used but in good condition. Description was helpful and accuraate. Mailed at a reasonable timeframe and rate.
5,An incredibly true tale,"This book is the story of Derrick Todd Lee, a black serial killer. Stephanie Stanley, the author, got the idea to write this book from a source on this story. It was a good idea, as the other press on this story did not tell the background of Derrick Todd Lee. Mr. Lee was well known to the Louisiana police and had a long history of run ins with the law.Ms. Stanley is a superb writer. I hope that I will be able to read more by her.This is a tale of errors by the police and by the FBI. It is very difficult to read. It also saddens me, that due to errors in identifying Derrick (he was thought to be white, not black in the FBI profile, the police tended to look at the boyfriends of victims rather than the possiblity of a serial killer being loose) he was allowed to kill for longer than he should have been. At least the mistakes were not as bad as in the Coral Watts case (read ""Evil eyes"" by Corey Mitchell) and the Green River Killer case."
5,The sweet sounds of home,"Love it! It was/is good to go back to Reno, Nevada every now and again, and these guys help. Good solid sound after all these years. Good on you, eh? If you like a good old school punk sound, then this is for you. Enjoy ....PS: Kevin, get up to Seattle and play us some music!! :-)"
3,"three men, and they chase one such woman","For playwriting riddles, try this with your grandparents :The alledged DVD a glamorous look a fashion model marriage in India stlye. The desired goddess is chased by one policeman, one aging fashion expert, and of course her playboy fiance, who is actually pursued by the haughty older lover during the film. This is an off-course murder mystery, because for starters, the police are looking for the wrong female victim, and then the wrong male killer.Rog DVD is good after a glamorous India restaurant meal, and now I will have to look into similar ""esc=>backwaterlands@bollywood.movie"" lists ..."
5,Thank you NPR!,I can't say enough about this amazing CD. It's a compilation of beautiful music from Greece that will have you humming and singing along. I didn't think I could find such a melodious compilation of music from one country in one CD. The artists are obviously master's of their craft. I'm thankful for NPR's book on World Music that recommended this CD.
5,Great and Authentic,This book truly encompasses what it means to be an authentic German cookbook. My grandmother is German so I know first-hand that these recipes are accurate. I have tried many of the recipes and all have turned out well. I also enjoyed the history of the old-german which was a staple to Ann Arbor for many years!
2,Old German,"The book was a major disappointment. I was expecting more detailed recepies, and something more unique. I think it is very much over priced for the quality."
1,Where's the steam?,"This thing is ridiculous. The fact that it even HAS a low & high setting is a joke. Even at the highest setting, it barely creates any steam. What's the point? A facial steam machine should do two things:1. create warm/hot steam2. push it towards your faceThis unit does neither. A pathetic product.I'm disusted and feeling VERY ripped-off."
4,Ok product!,"I bought this item as a gift to my wife, however, she complain about it first time she use it. 1. the steam isnt strong enough so that you have to be very close to the machine. 2. the so call custom soft-touch facial mask is so hot that you dont want to put your face on it.Beside these two points, this facial sauna works ok. I heard that the homedics is better than conair, is it true? if anyone have compare those similar products, pls tell me."
3,Choking hazard!,"My daughter got this toy for Christmas, and I have thrown most of the pieces away after digging them out of her mouth! THey are so small that they fit right in there. The little ""cans"" are paper covered, which fall right off after an unexpected dunking in the potty or bathtub. I wanted something for her kitchen set, but these are way too small."
2,Displeased!,"The food, when I bought the set for my 2 1/2 year old, looked like a lot of fun. But, upon opening it, half of the items had to be put away for when she gets older, because they were too small. As for the rest of the set, everything is hollow and not very durable. I've thrown out alot of the fruits and vegetables, because they were smashed and broken in no time. I'd recommend trying to find another set!"
2,Poorly Made,"We purchased this set of food to go along with our 2 year old's kitchen. I wish I would have read the reviews first! While some of the foods in this set seem durable, most will be ruined the first time they get stepped on or mishandled! Our daughter does love to play with the food, but I hate to see what happens when her chicken legs and hot dogs are crushed!"
3,Cheap,"I bought this play food set to go with my 2 year old daughter's shopping cart/kitchen. The food is very small and flimsy. My daughter does play with it often, but I've had to throw away pieces as they get bent out of shape easily. If you have younger siblings they will find these irrisistable to chew on, and they can be a choking hazzard. There is also some strange food items, like salmon, etc."
3,go to toys r us if you want this,Ok I work at toys r us and normally I dont suggest going there. but lately i've noticed Amazon is way more expensive than where i work. that never used to be true. All these just like home products are considerably cheaper there and not even on sale. these arent top of the line toys in the first place they are cheap. so i'm shocked that amazon is charging up to ten dollars more on some of these items. i wanted to buy my son a pots and pans set here because i thought i would save money but never mind even without my discount its cheaper at toys r us
4,Good enough...,I bought this set at Toys r us for $16.99I have several 2 year olds at my house and they loove it!I did have to put away the cans and cereal boxes until they are a little olderbcause they will definatly get ruined very quickly by 2 year olds.But the rest of the pieces are fun.It is a good enough set for these kids....they seem to love it!!
3,Not worth the price,"I purchased this for my daughter for her play kitchen set. I guess I assumed the pieces would be a little bigger, which is my fault, but I had to seperate what she can play with and what will have to wait until she is older since a lot of things still go in her mouth. I do not think the boxes and cans will last long since they are thin and flimsy. I thought I was getting a great deal on amazon for spending $19.00 but after shipping it ended up being 32.00 when I couldve driven to a toys R us store and purchased it for $16. I have learned to price check EVERYTHING. The ""Just like home"" fruits and veggies in the bags at the store for $3.99 are so much bigger, and look realistic. I'd much rather buy them knowing I will only get 5 pieces of food for that price because they are well made! Buyer beware!"
4,A great chance to see Leslie Gore and Nancy Sinatra.,"Of all the Hullabaloo videos, this is definitely one of the best - and not just because portions of it are in living color. The featured performers include Leslie Gore, Nancy Sinatra, The Cyrcle, The Hollies, and, from Hullabaloo London, Gerry and the Pacemakers. All of them do a great job. As was mentioned above, this video contains The Cyrcle, which was managed by Brian Epstein. In the introduction, Paul Anka mentions that this group was named by Brian Epstein (The Cyrcle contains three members), just as he named the Beatles. ""Eppy"" might very well have named The Cyrcle, but he in no way named the Beatles."
5,Warmth and love for those who need to heal themselves,"The meditations in this book are very helpful for healing from past traumas. By practicing these exercises, one can attain a greater degree of self-acceptance, forgiveness of those who have hurt us, awareness of the present moment, and love for all sentient beings.We all need to envelop ourselves in the golden glow of love, to mother the parts of ourselves that have been grievously wounded in the past, and to let go of the pain. These meditations are designed to do that, to help us nurture ourselves and send positive energy back into the universe."
5,Meditative and Healing,"GUIDED MEDITATIONS is an excellent resource for anyone needing to contemplate and experience peace and healing. As a Spiritual Counselor for Hospice, I have used this book to help people who are dying find peace in the midst of one of life's most difficult circumstances. Each meditation is filled with words that guide one's soul through the mind and the emotions until one rests their awareness in the present moment. In the present moment, therein lies, infinity itself. -- Samuel Oliver, author of, WHAT THE DYING TEACH US: LESSONS ON LIVING."
4,if you like this 100% I'd be 5 stars.,"But if you know what other releases Rising High have been, well..these are classics and there's a volume 2."
5,Great Rockabilly,"If you like the old rockabilly days, this will be a treat. It's especially enjoyable because all of the performers are enjoying the music."
3,so so,"I bought this CD because the ""line up"" of super stars promised a great album. I am disappointed, at best. The ""sound recording"" isn't very good. I suppose one might say that this CD isn't my cup of tea. That would be a kind statement."
5,FINALLY!,"I agree with the other reviewers...the DVD is an absolute gem. But to have this finally available on CD, and to be able to listen to it on my iPod on my daily walk, or to blast it in the car...priceless.Carl was so energized and into this session, and obviously SO touched by the affection and admiration that the ""youngsters"" had for him, and that vibe is evident throughout. Of course it's now bittersweet to hear George Harrison playing with one of his idols, but George's joy is also so clear to see and hear.The CD and DVD are both worthy additions to anyone's music collection."
3,Some errors,"Granted, I have only looked at the threaded message board for my example but its taken 3 hours to make it work. There are multiple variables that haven't been defined and arrays that use the wrong syntax for the current revision of PHP. Definitely not for the true beginner, however, if you have any experience in scripting languages, you'll be able to figure out what is wrong with it and make the fixes. It has some good base code that, with a little massaging, is very useful."
1,Not worth any bookshelf space,"I bought this book in 2002 and have never found any use for it. It's much too thick to put under that table leg that's a little too short. I'm finally taking it off my bookshelf to make room for books that have some value. If you really want to implement one of the projects in this book, I'm sure that you can find much better code someplace on the Web."
1,humongous keys for a toddler,The keys were extremely large. they were too large for my grandson to play with. the picture looks so small. I didn't even receive my refund after returning the keys.
3,Does the Job!,"I do not use circular polarizers all the time, so I needed a cheap way to use only one filter on all my lenses. I got theB+W 72mm XS-Pro Kaesemann Circular Polarizer with Multi-Resistant Nano Coatingfor my largest diameter lens, Sony 16-50 f2.8 @ 72mm, and got two step-up rings for my other lenses: Sony 70300G and Sony 35mm f1.8. This 62mm to 72mm step-up ring is actually for using the CP filter onSony SAL70300G 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 SSM ED G-Series Compact Super Telephoto Zoom Lenslens.The plan works, however, I have found out that I cannot use the lens hoods because of the step-up rings! It is a minor issue considering the high price of CP filters and low price of the rings, but I should have thought it more through. Besides, I now prefer if I got a 77mm filter, so later I could use it on bigger lenses likeSony SAL70400G 70-400mm f/4-5.6 G SSM Lens."
1,Cost More To Order Through Amazon,The price for this item is less on Amazon $5.74 but the shipping is higher $6.46. On the Adorama site the shipping is $5.00. Total through Amazon $12.20 direct from Adorama $6.95 for same ring and $5.00 shipping $11.95. What gives? Costs an extra 1.46 for shipping when ordered through Amazon looks like a profit center for Adorama. Reduce the item price to get the sale and make it up in shipping and handling.
4,Very Insightful,"Great book for anyone who would like to learn about Thai vs. Western values concerning dating, marriage, and family."
5,Thailand Fever,"i didn't think that there was that much of a big difference between Thai and American cultures. But I was wrong. A friend told me to read this book because it was an eye opener for him. when my girlfriend told me that she wanted me to meet her parents the next time I'm out there, I thought ""sure, no big deal"". but, after reading the book, I learned that it was a big deal in Thai society. The book is meant for both the American and Thai, so I bought another copy and sent it to her. Now I'm waiting to see what she thinks about it."
4,Good insight,"A good insight and a must read for westerners who are thinking of, or are, in a relationship with a Thai girl."
5,Thailand Fever - Addresses the important cultural issues,"Thailand fever address important cultural issues common in Thai/Western romantic relationships. Thailand and the Thai people are warm and inviting, but for the unprepared westerner, some Thai customs are strange and difficult to understand. This is true for the Thai person in the relationship regarding Western customs. This book addresses both sides of the cultural divide with clarity and wit. It is written in Thai and English so each person can read about cultural differences in their own language. It was very helpful to me in my relationship."
3,Thailand Fever,"This is an interesting read but there are better publications out there such as `Money Number 1`, and `The Fool is Back`..I found the information in the book useful but i didnt care much for the format in that each side of a page was written in both English and Thai. The book is therefore aimed at a very small market."
3,thailand fever,"I found a lot of truths contained in this book,sure there are some things that i might not agree with but it is full of some useful information that i do agree with.I wish i had read this book before i travelled to Thailand"
3,Thai Book,This book was somewhat interesting and I like the idea that half the book was English the other half was written in Thai. I will read it with my Thai girl friend together which is a a good concept and should enjoy reading together and discuss the contents.
4,ISSUES TO PONDER,A book that provides a picture of what is to come in a culture that views relationships in manners quite different from the west.
5,Awesome knowledge,"This is the book which gives awesome knowledge and insight to any male thinking of having a girlfriend or wife from Thailand.An indepth look into relationships from the ""Land of Smiles"".In English and Thai,covers most or all misunderstandings from both sides.I recommend this so much that i have sent my copy to my girlfriend in Thailand."
5,Beautiful wine glasses,"These glasses are a good size and a nice weight. They do not feel as if they will break in your hand, and yet are elegant and classy. I would recommend them to anyone looking for stemware to match their china!"
4,This Heininger ain't a Keeper!,"Like someone else had mentioned, don't expect this to play nice with a Keeper cargo bar. The Keeper bar is TOO narrow for the Heininger. Having said that, you can always add something in between the Keeper cargo bar and this divider bar. I used couple of strips of steel (1/4 inch thick), and they work fine."
4,great accessory,This bar is as strong as it says...I bought it only because I thought it came with the original hitchmate bar that I purchased from Sportsmans guide for my husbands pickup...I thought it was a packaged deal but the divider bar is sold separately. Even so both are a good deal!
3,"Nice idea, wrong product",Seems good and sturdy but I had to return it because it would only work with a HitchMate bar. Other manufacturers bars are round but HitchMate is square. I can't say it's a bad item but it just wasn't for me.
3,Kindle version is poor import,The Kindle version of this book is poor to read. Paragraphs are disjointed. Some paragraphs never end with a complete sentence or a period. The biggest problem is between sections 208 and 220. The mathematical formula is missing. This looks like a font is missing. I am using my IPAD to view and type this review. Kindle version is 2.01. This is not a review on the contents of the book. The implementation is the problem.
4,Timely information for my family,"This book came at a critical time in the life of one of our children. I couldn't understand where the anger was coming from. This book provided us not only some background on possible sources of the anger, but more importantly, how we can best deal with the consequences for our child and the rest of the family as well. I would highly recommend this book to any parent with teenage children!"
2,Too open on the front side. Too tide.,I recommend to buy a half number bigger than you are. I'm 8 and that's the size I bought but is too tide. My fingers hurts. It's very well made.
4,J & D Delfina Review,"Beautiful shoe, beautiful stacked wood heel. I did have a problem with blisters on a couple of toes after wearing an 8 hour day, but I still love the shoes."
4,Classy Open Toe Pump,I love the looks of this shoe. It is versatile as I have worn them with jeans and dresses. It is fairly comfortable but needs to be broken in more like any leather high-heeled pump. The sizing runs normal. A good purchase.
5,wonderful dish ~ easy cleanup,"I love this brand of cookwear. I recently purchased this red piece to add to my ""collection"" and I love it. It's the best piece of cookwear I have that food really won't stick to (with no teflon involved, either, to pamper from scratches and peeling). Cleanup is truly a breeze with these corning creations pieces. I'd recommend them to anyone who loves to bake but doesn't like the mess of presoaking and scraping to cleanup. They look wonderful, too, forever!!!"
2,Good news/Bad news,"First, the good news: Beautiful color, beautiful design, affordable. Next, the bad news: After giving my family a lecture about being careful with these casseroles (I bought two sizes), I chipped a small piece off the handle as I was washing it before its first use!Considering the great care I was taking, I'd rate these casseroles as UNREASONABLY breakable. They won't last long through everyday use, so I cannot recommend them. My suggestion: Save up and buy Le Creuset enameled cast iron cookware, which your great-grandchildren will happily inherit."
3,"Excellent color, restricted use","Beautiful color perfect size. Arrived in mint condition. However, the description said ""oven use"", therefore I thought this size would be great for my large toaster oven ( I live alone) and very rarely use the ""big"" stove oven. Wrong! This is not designed for use in any toaster oven. I most definitely will not buy another piece of this stoneware and would definitely reccommend another brand!"
2,not that great,"I didn't hear anything new from the band with this. I think it was mostly re-mixed kinds of stuff. Remember this is a soundtrack and all but 3 tracks are the same acustic guitar rythems,tribal drum beat with no vocals. If you like Seplutura for their heavy head bangging, fist pumpping madness with a timely tribal beat this is the exact oppisite."
1,Hate It,"I love Tom Jones, but he has lost it. This CD is awful. His voice is not there anymore and you can tell by the way he is singing. I think he should just give it up and stop singing. This was a waste of money."
1,give this one a pass,"I agree with Ann. I have been teaching and practicing this artform for a number of years and purchase most books I find on the topic. This one is among the worst. There are no clear instructions, very poor quality equipment, and I suspect if this was a person's first introduction to brush painting it would be their last. Instead, see Ning Yeh for the very best instruction manuals and videos, along with some very good introductions by Pauline Charrett, Susan Frame, Jane Evans and Nan Rae. The best brushes and authentic chip colours can be ordered from Ning Yeh at AOS, and the best paper, ink and stones, along with high quality brushes from Acornplanet."
2,left this fan disappointed,"First of all let me just say: I love Ken Nordine. I've bought every CD of his that I can find, and my wife and I even fell in love listening to him. He was always so distinct and clever i was in constant amazement.But now, man, _Transparent Mask_ is dissapointing. None of the tracks are very clever, in story or words. Plus it's much more ""normal"" poetry than what I was used to from Ken. It felt like instead of putting energy into clever ideas (like what a museum of sound would be like, or how was the color yellow was allowed into the spectrum) he's just trying to rhyme.And the subject matter is blase also -- songs of birds and spiders, not songs of Vidiots.He still has one of the deepest voices I've ever heard, but it just aint enough. If you're a fan don't buy this CD, if you aint a fan buy Colors or Word Jazz -- they'll make you a fan."
5,"I have listened to Ken Nordine and Word Jazz, since his first broadcast, a lifetime ago. My late wife knew him in Chicago.","Great album. What a terrific voice. I would even enjoy him reading the phonebook. He found his niche in the entertainment world, and has been doing it for over sixty years very sucessfully Hang in there KEN."
4,The future of metal is this....not Slipknot,"..[This] is the bomb. I wonder why no one ever heard of this highly talented bunch of guys...One listen to this album, will open doors to the far and beyond. The samples, keyboards, guitars and vocals are to the T. The band sounds very much like Faith No More, played with a much much bigger crunch, which is a great thing, cos I really miss those guys.The band uses two vocalists, who compliment each other well. While one has the trademark Mike Patton like vocals, the other gives the songs the guttural crunch. The songs breathe a fresh air into the nu metal arena. They are melodic, progressive and as the same time, oppressively heavy. Check out ""The New Cult King"", ""Never let it go"", ""Before I die"", and ""Born of desire"".Wake up guys, this is the octet band you ought to be listening to!!..."
3,The album is alright but........,"Hmm......... The album is ok, but whoa, these dudes are complete RIP OFFS of Slipknot. They want to be Knot so bad, and they're close, but still. Their song structure is pretty good, but they're vocals are horrible. They have two vocalists, and both aren't very good. The one who sings sounds like Kud from Mudvayne (he rules, but wait for it) and Ozzy mixed, and the result is not impressing. The screamer is good though, but nothing compared to Corey. The keyboards are so easy I can play em. I recommend this album after your finshed with Mudvayne, Slipknot and Ozzy's new album, it should be the desert of a big dinner."
1,MUSHROOMHEAD,Wow!! This album has 26 tracks (#s16-42) that are nothing but four seconds of silence that Amazon will gladly sell you for .99 cents each. That's Hillarious.I would rather purchase and listen to the silent tracks than hear these songs for free.
1,Enough is enough,"two OK songs, the rest sounds just like every other Nu metal band, when is everybody gonna stop this NU-metal marketing crap, just end it all ready."
4,Unusual.... sounds like slipknot jr.(or sr.),"Slipknot was always a metal band for the ages. These new guys, Mushroomhead, are like their successors, only with the music a little less heavy. Before I Die is definitely the best track. Every track sounds like it was written for several days. They really try to put out a compelling record, and it came out great. This is no doubt a successive band that the the [public] will welcome greatly. ... Actually, these guys have worn the masks for almost a decade. They have probably worn them longer than Slipknot, and are underappreciated for it. Now all they have to do is become appreciated for the compelling music they create."
5,I'm really impressed.,I almost bought this cd when it was first released but I think I bought something else and completely forgot about them but just the other day I saw it again so I decided to pick it up. I'm so glad I got it(although it cost me $25 Canadian).Also like most people have already mentioned they are commonly compaired to Slipknot. However I like Mushroomhead far more than Slipknot.Mushroomhead also tones down the swearing which is a good thing if your parents are strick on what you listen to. I enjoy listening to a cd where you don't hear cursing every couple minutes.
5,All Hail Mushroomhead!!!!,"This is a terrific album! No flaws, no bad songs whatsoever. Every song has great meaning. Definite must-have for any true metalhead!"
4,real,"I think Mushroomhead is in the long haul. I read that the Slipknot Clown and Corey Taylor were talking trash about them cuz they were halloweenish stuff. That guy pacman44 claimed that Mushroomhead started that trend, despite it being a lie. The halloween costumed rockers go back before either band, so all in all that shouldn't make a difference to anyone; just means the band's about the people and the tunes. The best stuff I think here is Before I Die and Never Let it Go. Make no mistake, this is nothing close to a perfect album, no modern metal album is. Hardcore fans will love it. Any straight rock fan will love it. I give four stars cuz it sounds great for a debut. They're next album should be out in the spring, that one will surely be twice as good."
5,Mushroomhead are great!,"The thing that makes me angrier than anything else, is when morons say that Mushroomhead ripped off Slipknot. The fact is, Slipknot are heading straight downhill, whereas Mushroomhead have always been at the top. They will be remembered far longer than Slipknot will, because they have something most bands these days don't- talent."
5,Mushroomhead a pleasent surprise!!,"This next band has quite possibly made the most unique music that I have ever had the privilege to listen to. They offer eclectic and unique vocals from both of their lead vocalists, ranging from the growls and screams of J Mann to the melodic, unique and hard-hitting singing of Jeffrey Nothing. I guarantee this is one of the most unique metal acts you have ever heard and will ever hear for some time to come. They manage to create great metal with interesting and inventive instrumentals. They even barrow from such genres as funk, electronica, hip-hop and hardcore metal and mix it into one sound that they can truly call their own. Well, if you are daring enough to take a chance like I was you will be pleasantly surprised..."
4,Unusual,"These guys are very compelling in both image and music. I have never seen masked rockers other than Slipknot that can rock so hard. They have worn the mask for almost a decade, so everyone can STOP saying they are Slipknot posers. This stuff is fast, hard, fueled by adreniline, and extremely loud. This one begs to be cranked up on the stereo. The best song is Before I Die. There are several elements thrown into the music that really can get a person to think how they do this. The bottom line is, they throw a little bit of everything into their music, and that is why they sound more creative than a lot of other bands."
5,"Different, but good","Mushroomhead..... if nothing else, these guys have an original sound. The musical talent is good, not great, but they have a very unusual but still good sound. If you are looking for generic ""nu-metal""(i hate the term but it gets the point accross), then you may want to download a few songs before buying the whole CD. On the other hand, if youre looking to move away from the pop-infested world of nu-metal (Adema, Papa Roach, From Zero, etc) then this is a must have CD. To be honest, at first i didnt like this CD, but after listening to it a few times it grew on me. Give this band a chance and if youre open to a different kind of metal then you wont be disappointed."
5,THE MOST UNDERRATED BAND IN MUSIC,"Finally, the official national debut album is out! Double X is made up of newly mixed tracks from Mushroomhead's three independent albums and it also includes a cover of Pink Floyd's ""Empty Spaces."" Don't even mention the name of that other band while you are looking at the XX album cover! Mushroomhead is the most underrated band in rock right now and deserve major recognition. And this album proves that they deserve it. Just put the cd in and sit down or you will hurt yourself. Buy the CD right now or you will be missing the next big thing, because their rise to the top is ""inevitable."""
2,Vocals Kill It ! ! !,"Like Cannibal Corpse and Suffocation, this band's music is great but the vocals and lyrics are extreamly dissapointing. I still want to know why the lyrics make no sense and are innapropriate for a rock album. Quoting scenes from ""Star Wars"" the movie is NOT a way to ""reel-em-in"". But that is where my gripes stop. The music is unique to say the least. The instrumentals are amazing (more or less because of the lack of vocals), and the music is also great and shows a lot of tallent on their part. This is a great band music and image wise, but the vocals just kill it for me......"
4,"Slipknot wannabes, yet great music","This is very good album.""Before I Die"" is easily there best song. One of there singers has a deep, growling voice and sounds awesome.""These Filthy Hands"" combines melodic keyboarding with awesome guitars riffs. Another thing is the bass can be heard on this album, which is really rare. Also their drummer uses his double kick drums to the max. They may be considered nu-metal (which i hate), but they still sound awesome."
4,MUSHROOMHEAD: XX,"This cd is great. Amazing. Though a comment for some people who say that they did the mask gig before slipknot, um SLIPKNOT STARTED THAT FIRST. No matter what you say. Check out ""Slipknot- Behind the Masks"" (DVD). if you dont beleive me. So anyway this cd is great. Stand out songsBefore I DieThese Filthy HandsXeroxedThe New Cult King43"
5,Mushroomhead...,"Well, i picked this cd up awhile ago, after seeing them in a magazine. Maybe one of the most original bands to EVER come out. their style is a healthy mix of black metal (production and guitar riffs are somewhat familiar to darkthrone, but nothing too tracable) hip-hop (vocals from mann) techno (samples and pulsing bass driven songs) metal (classic metal vocals from nothing) and symphonic metal (nice melodic keys in tracks such as solitaire unraveling, the wrist, and the new cult king)...if you are in search for music that is original and entertaining...pick this album up as soon as possible."
2,Severe and noticable lack of melody,"I consider myself fairly open minded on music, though I have a definate prefrence for heavier genres. I enjoy listening to everything from Slipknot to Our Lady Peace, Slayer to A Perfect Circle, but I absolutely could not stand this album. At times it seems to strive towards being a ripoff of Slipknot's debut, but then veer off in their own style, which doesn't contain any talent of note, and consists mainly of droning repetitive guitar riffs and garbled vocals without the redeeming quality of melody involved anywhere. The fact that this is rated above 2.5 stars at the absolute highest is a travesty."
1,Unfortunately isn't all its cracked up to be.,"this ""clevelands best secret"" isn't all its cracked up to be-period. you'll might not be selling this one on half.com the day after you open it, but it probably wont find a resident address in your cd changer.-sorry the word is that all the songs are old rehashed songs on a ""new cd"" to get into your wallet for their ""1st"" national release. SAVE YOUR $."
1,do not buy this cd,"I first heard about this group online and downloaded their song ""Before I Die."" I thought, ""Hey, these guys sound a lot like Slipknot! This group might be alright."" I bought the cd cheap [...], but I still regret every dollar spent on it. The first track, ""Before I Die,"" was good, and actually the next track, ""Bwomp,"" is good too, featuring some tight rhyming skills. But after that, prepare for music that shouldn't even be classified as music. Most of it is one guy with an annoying, whining voice singing high, another guy trying to sound badass with his low shouts, random keyboard chords playing over and over, and songs with no melody or appeal at all. I struggled just to listen to the record once. It is downright terrible and scary at times. Do not buy this CD!!!"
5,Mushroomhead blows my mind,"Anyone out there, well the 15% of you left who think sliknot has any leverage over these guys should be sent to afghanistan. Mushroomhead has got to be the most unique and on the rise band out yet, they have a style that one minute can sound like heavy/death metal and then in the same song switch to a punk/rap with a metal backround and some turntables. these guys know there music and much love goes out to them"
5,Major assault on the ears,This album kicks. Forget the fact that they have a similar look to Slipknot because these guys are on a completely different level when it comes to music. Slipknot are just plain brutal and heavy and right in your face while Mushroomhead is complex and melodic while retaining all the heaviness you would expect. They layer their music in such an amazing way words really can't describe it. You must buy this album. Your ears will thank you in the end.
3,Sound was off,This was a gift for my son and he said-----Enjoyed it but the acoustics sounds off like rerecorded or something. Loved the disc though.
3,Its ok,"I first bought this cd when a friend told me not to get it, so it had already placed a bad impression on me. Mushroomhead is really over on these synthesizers, because they use them a lot, and on every song. There are some weird songs about canker sores. And there are numerous silent tracks, which makes it impossible to play on shuffle mode on a cd player. But other than that the second track is great and so is soltaire unraveling."
4,"Good except for the ""goth"" guy","Let me break this down very simply: The riffs and drumming are very aggressive, and definitely groove. Also, there is some really interesting use of a string section as well as a synthesizer/organ. As for the vocals, there are two vocalists; the rough/heavy voice is excellent, the smooth/singing voice is just not what I like. I expected a smooth, synth-infused voice ala burton c. bell, or perhaps monotone-ly soulful like corey taylor (8), but the voice here is whispery and whiney. Imagine the guy from Midnight Oil singing on a death/speed metal album, and that is what you get. Overall a decent release, but I expect more from the second release to be truly impressed."
5,once and for all...,"...slipknot ripped off shroomhead, not the other way around. shroomhead formed in '93, slipknot in '95. i just saw these guys for the 1st time in almost 3 years 2 nights ago and even without J Mann, they can still rock harder than sucky corey taylor, especially when they opened the show making fun of slipknot, masks, kegs, and all. ill admit, i may be a little bias, im from akron, ohio and these guys have been local heroes for over 10 years now, but creatively theyre better, musically theyre better, and when it comes to devotion to their fans, they are much better. ive been silent for too long, just had to speak my piece."
4,Better than the whole slipknot pack,"Fact-Slipknot is one of the dumbest bands in the world. Even No.4 and No.8 agreed with me by starting stone sour, a band taht i dont like but nevertheless not a stupid growl-and-whine band. Mushroomhead is new and original. Before I die, Never let it go, and These filthy hands are some great songs. The music is just as good as their images. I dont believe in new music at all anymore, and when I hear about a band I dont look them up becuase I've lost faith and now i just like the cds i liked before I lost faith in music, and this is one of them"
5,THIS ALBUM ROCKS!!!!!!!!!,"if you like clean-cut, hardcore, heavy metal, then this is the album for you. MuShRoOmHeAd is one of the most innovative bands out there, so pick this one up today! you won't be dissapointed.. i promise :D"
5,Perfect for the novice chef,"I have some hardcore kitchenware but I have no real culinary skills. What I like about this CorningWare quiche dish is that my ""experiments"" brown evenly in it. I actually have never used the dish to cook quiche. I've made salmon, potatoes au gratin, mac & cheese, and casserole-like dishes in it and every time it delivered a perfect crust. It fits nicely in my toaster oven as well so I do not have to fire up the big, gas stove during the summer months. It is sturdy construction. I have not managed to chip it though I have lightly banged it into random kitchen objects by accident. Though I do not advise this, I've taken the dish from the oven straight to the sink (removing the contents first obviously) and filled it with cold water to soak the dish. I do not treat this dish very well, but it has held up nicely and it never disappoints. Plus, the color is hot. Next to my stockpot, this is my go-to dish."
4,Quality and installation instructions,"Quality: Seemed a little bit on the flimzy side for strength of construction. Probably O.K., but I'm not convinced that the plastic DIN and dash board cowling with its metal DIN insert would hold the AM/FM CD Receiver in the slot under bumpy road conditions without coming loose. So, I beefed it up with good old duct tape wrapped around the sides of the plastic DIN and around the metal DIN, so as not to interfere with inserting or removing the receiver. Other than that the installation kit fit perfectly into my car with no need for any adjustment.Installation instructions: Wasn't clear as to whether or not to use the rectangular plastic fitting ring that fits behind the face of the receiver. There were no instruction on what its purpose was. After experimentation I determined that I shouldn't use the plastic fitting ring because the receive wouldn't lock into the metal DIN slots when I used it."
2,Great Idea but cheap construction,Per other writers one end broke off after one use. If you set or rest anything on the end of the sawhorse it will probably break the end off. The plastic is too thin to support any weight on the ends.
4,Fat Max is Slim,"Great product. Good quality, sturdy, packs away easily and is versatile.Its is time to diacard my old bulky wood saw horses."
3,"Liked it, Loved it, then came the frustration.","Exactly what the title describes. When I first got the mic it worked fine, and there were no problems... I used it for my PC for recording but the volume was kinda low. Well, I've had the mic for about a month now and the wire has gotten really sensitive and the cable has become loose real easy on the mic, and and that causes the mic to not detect sound, and there is lateness in responding sometimes. The mis is good but the cable is very sensitive."
4,Good mic for the price.,"It's pretty inexpensive, but it does a great job. Great sound quality for vocals and music. My only complaint is there it pops rather loudly when you turn it on and off. I don't know if that's something with all mics or just this one, but it's sort of annoying when you're trying to edit."
4,"So far, so good!",I purchased this microphone for my 6 year old daughter to replace a microphone to her karaoke machine that the dog chewed up. This mic was inexpensive and works fine so far. We haven't had it very long so it has not really been put to the test of time.
3,expected a little more,I bought this to use as a second karaoke mic and to double as a mic for my husband to use for his guitar. It is very light plastic-just not as good quality even as the one that came with the karaoke machine. I expected a little more from SONY.
3,"Lightweight, works ok,","This mic is not as good as the one that the Karaoke machine came with. It is quieter and more lightweight, but there are no problems with it, we use it as a secondary mic. So far so good."
3,3 stars and only just,"I respect the musos involved to much to give this any less, but boy is this hard to listen to. This is a close to a wankfest as I have ever heard HERRING / TRUCKS sound. Endless passages of "" I CAN PLAY FASTER THEN YOU CAN"" and very little material to work with. Every tune is twice as long as it should have been. POPPER gets on my nerves, his singing is totaly unsuited to this format.This is not a patch on THE AQUARIUM RESQUE UNIT or any other of JIMMY HERRING's projects. ENDANGRED SPECIES and PROJECT Z are so much better. All of TRUCKS's solo efforts are brilliant and it is hard to believe that this is the best material that these giants of the musik world can produce. There is obviously some outstanding playing on this CD, but the musik is well below average."
1,poppers folly,"This CD had the makings of a great recording. The problem was telling Popper where they were performing!Butch,please record another one but leave Popper at home.He's full of a lot of things,but TALENT isn't one of them!"
1,Croakin' Period!,"As a long time Allman Brother Band fan I was really disappointed in this pointless album. I have one question, WHY?"
3,Favorite so far,"Spoilers, so proceed with caution.This is my favorite of the series so far. He seemed to repeat himself a lot less and there was a lot going on. [It was so obvious that Mr. and Mrs. Cavendish were the Murder Masques. I was a little sad to have no Eddie or Susie in this one but Dead Boy was in interesting character."
3,"Gritty, Dark, and Ho-Hum","This is a series that so far I have been pretty middle of the road with. I want to read the next one, the storylines are good, and quick, and Green is a hilarious author. Still it is missing something I have yet to put my finger on. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the fantasy genre, especially a fantasy genre that leaves urban behind and focuses more on the world that is Nightside as opposed to all of the things crashing down in London."
4,Best so far.,"Taylor's world is not a place one would ever want to visit: a part of London called Nightside where it is always 3 a.m. But, except for the monsters, has the feel and elements of a classic detective novel. If you enjoy Jim Butcher or Charlaine Harris, you might give these a try. I'd recommend starting at the beginning of the series but do feel this is the best so far. I shall be eagerly awaiting book four and the next visit to Nightside."
5,Another Hit for Green,"I have read everything I can find by this author and the Nightside novels are some of this best and most creative. John Taylor is human with a devilish twist, a heart and a mind in conflict much of the time. I hope this is not the last of these. Every time I finish one I am in the mood for more. This is a must read for any Green fans."
3,I expected more,I went in not expecting much and that's exactly what I got. It's a quick and easy read but the ending was disappointing. I expect more from an established author. I like the concept of the series and might read the next one but I have been disappointed so far. This one is the worst of the first three in the series.
3,If I could give 3.5 I would.,I have to say that this the only installment of the Nightside series that I truly dislike not so much because of the setting which is always fun and interesting but because of the plot line. The old plotline the starlet held against her will by morally corrupt music managers has been used in every series of mystery books that I have ever read. I have always found this plot point to be idiotic but at least it proves that Green is not perfect and is as susceptible to cliques as the rest of us.
5,Great design book,"This is one of the few books, that actually take you though the thought process, it's not a Photoshop ""cookbook"" but it gives the reader an idea about how a project came to be. Many books include art/ads you have never seen, but this include well known work from big design firms and there's design pieces from clients like Bjork, Coke and Nike."
4,The war continues to take,"""Darkness, Be My Friend"" is the fourth book of the Tomorrow Series and the story revolves around Ellie and the group spending time stealthily in Wirrawee, which presents them with opportunities to attempt to further sabotage the enemy. In the process though they learn the fate of some friends and family members as the war continues to erode their old lives.The group finds themselves confronted with unanswered questions and this uncertainty is a cause of further insecurity in amongst the anxiety of an enemy that seeks them.Life on the run takes its toll as their perspective towards their future is walled by a war that seems to have no end in sight. Yet survival and knowing their next steps is what keeps the reader thirsty to continue on with the series to the very end.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
3,If you DON'T like Sad Endings--DON'T READ THIS!!!,"This book is OKAY, I mean, Book I and Book II are the BEST books in the Tomorrow Series.Anyway, I thought this book was rather boring and it didn't have as near as much good stuff in it that the first three had. When, I finished this book, I was greatly dissapointed because I HATE books with sad endings. It just tears my heart away.This is the last book I read in the series because it got SO boring when I got half way through the 5th book. And, I hate the way the series ends (I took a sneak peak in the last book and found out what happened--lol). So therefore, I advise you, if you DO NOT like books with sad endings, don't read this!!!"
5,Amazing Series!,"This whole series is absoultly addictive and burning for revenge is no different. The continuing adventures of Ellie and the others are just as engrossing as ever. I was so eager to get my hands on this book that I ordered it from Europe! I got the rest of the series all the way from Australia... A bit spendy, but what can you do? :) If you have not read this book, you must do so, you won't regret it."
4,grandsons school read,"My grandson had to have this for a school reading assignment. He liked it, but books for shouldn't be so high priced for digital reading!!!"
3,What a letdown!,"The first three books were filled with action, romance and courage. The 4th book, Darkness, Be My Friend, barely covered these topics which made the other three so great. Unlike the other ones, there wasn't a big action scene in which the five triumphed like in the other ones. There weren't any Wirrawee Bridge or Cobbler's Bay scenes in the fourth book. The romance was minimal and the book dragged on at times. However, I couldn't put it down and I read it in one day."
3,Here we go again,"I'm a big fan of the first three, and I love the way that the third one ended, but this book does nothing for the series. I got bored, and realised that the excitement that made the first one so original, has been gradually declining with the publication of each book. Nevertheless, this is hard to put down, and if you've read one, you may as well read them all. It's just sad that this is not the end, there are others. I find myself spending too much time with these characters and beginning to despise them."
5,Great book.,Very good book and a lot of fun to read. You get really absorbed into the characters. I highly recommend.
1,from an architect,"I have seen almost every house in this book published before and the ones that i hadn't seen weren't anything special. In fact several of the homes are quite old by Moore Ruble, Predock, Gwathmy, etc. If you have a collection of residential books allready, pass this one over."
5,great book,"This book gives a complete perception of the houses described, because of plans and multiple views inside the houses. That is what I expected from a book like that: not only a compilation of pictures"
4,Bett Crocker's Microwave Cookbook,It is a great book have made several of the dishes and they have turned out really good. Explains things real clear I am sure I will enjoy this book for a long time to come.
5,betty crocker's microwave cook book,Great book for getting everyday microwave cooking times. I would purchase again. very good transaction. good service. all is good.
4,"Not quite what I was expecting, but I like it","I wasn't expecing this purse to be made out of a canvas-like material, however, I am not dissatisfied by it. It feels rough but also very, very sturdy. I've already tossed all of my makeup, cell phone, wallet and hairbrush in (that's like five pounds worth of stuff) and the purse feels like it could hold more without stressing.It does not have any pockets, but is small enough so that is not a major issue."
5,Great product,I am really enjoying this handbag. All of my students and coworkers have made positive comments about this bag. Keep up the good work!
1,very disappointed,"Nothing like I expected,too small, looks more like a bag for a girl of 5 years old. I'm not recommend it to anyone."
1,Size does matter,"I was not satisfied with the purchase of this product because the pictures of the item did not display the true size of the item and gave the impression that it was bigger than it actually was. When I received the item, I was very disappointed with the size as well as the dullness of the colors. In the picture they look vibrant and bright, however this was not the case when I received the item."
2,Looks worn,"I purchased this as a gift and when it arrived, I was disappointed with it. The canvas looks as if it was stone washed and I felt that it was a bit too worn looking to give as a gift. It also arrived pretty wrinkled and not finished (as in ironed). I attempted to iron it to see if it would look better, but it didn't. This is not a bad bag, but I didn't feel it was giftable. Better to buy this in a store where you can see exactly what it looks like before you buy. By the time I pay for the return shipping, I will be out most of my purchase cost."
4,polka dot purse,"I love this purse! It is a quality canvas purse with straps at the perfect length. It is the perfect size and it velcros shut, the only drawback is that it doesn't have any pockets."
3,The scales don't line up,"This is a quality wrench (by feel) however on the one that I received the N/m and the inch/lb scales do not line up at 0. So this makes it impossible to properly calibrate the wrench for both scales. It isn't bad enough to send it back but it is annoying and shows poor quality control.This, of course, makes me wonder how accurate the wrench is overall."
3,depends on what you're doing,"This torque wrench seems more accurate at heavier torque ratings, like bottom brackets etc.... Its proabbly best to check torque specss for your job(s) on park tools.com before you buy this one or the ratcheting type.Basically, if you're buying this to do anything under 60 inch-lbs, you're probably better off with the ratcheting type torque wrench. This one seems better suited to heavier duty specs.Seems to be made just fine, except it was a bit off calibration (zero) when I got it."
5,Works as Described,I have used the smaller version of this for about a year and have been happy. So I decided to buy the 70 newton meter version. Only used it twice so far to tighten a crank set on a bicycle. Seems to work just fine. Just be sure to get a 3/8 inch hex set for your Allen style nuts. I noticed Stanley sells a set where ALL the hex sockets are 3/8th. So just be sure (for the bicycle folks reading this) you get 3/8 hex set or you might need an adapter.
4,simple and does the job,"There are two varieties of torque wrench: those that work with a ratcheting mechanism and those that work simply by measuring deflection of a metal rod. This tool is obviously one of the latter variety. If you don't need very high accuracy, then this tool is robust, reliable, and still accurate enough for most tasks. I use mine for general bike repair tasks, such as valve jobs. Some ratcheting torque wrenches can fail prematurely, but these deflection-based designs will not. Sometimes the scale doesn't line up at zero. When this happens, I just bend the indicator bar until it's re-zeroed. The only down-side is that it's somewhat bulky, but this is inevitable given the way it makes the measurements. It would be nice if the wrench had a standard ratcheting head, hence I knock off a star. Perhaps it would be expensive to make the wrench in a way that the ratcheting wouldn't impair accuracy of the measuring arm?"
5,Excellent Customer Service!,"Both the music and the Customer Service of the Seller were absolutely wonderful, thank you so much !Darius Lundberg"
3,Great product aside from the plug.,"My only complaint is that the plug is not reliable. It doesn't seem to fit well in the socket and make a good connection. On numerous occasions I'd plug it in (making sure the power light was on), go back to work on the job site for 30-45 minutes, and come back expecting a hot lunch only to discover that the plug had lost its connection and my lunch was still cold. That was only after a couple months of occasional use. Very frustrating.However, other than that issue, which could probably be solved by replacing the plug (which you obviously shouldn't have to do to a newer product, but could), I think this stove is great. It's a very manageable size, but but still big enough to hold a big helping of food for one person. It also gets the food pretty hot in a reasonable amount of time. I'm glad I bought it."
2,Doesn't work with all cars,"I was very disappointed to find out that this stove is only to be used in a car when the car is not moving. Our car's axillary outlet does not work when the car is not on and it is not advised to run the car on ""idle"" for any length of time. This makes the stove unusable in a hybrid. This info should be stated on the website prior to ordering."
1,broke after 3 weeks,i got this stove for my boyfriend for christmas and he used it for not even three weeks and it broke.
2,"Great idea, but the DC plug broke apart after 3 months","When my husband received this for Christmas, he loved it. It heated up his leftovers within 20 minutes to hot and steamy while out on his trucking route. We had noticed that the DC plug was a bit of a snug fit in many of the car power outlets, but seeing that it worked itself in with a little twist, we paid it no mind. He used it everyday for 3 months, and then, when pulling it out of the car outlet, the grounding rod in the center of the plug stayed snugly in the cigarette lighter outlet and broke apart from the rest of the plug housing. It could not be repaired so sadly... the product failed for us. However, because it is such a great concept and is amazing when it works, we're considering the lower price price of some of Max Burton's competitors and we will probably purchase another similar item from another manufacturer."
1,DON'T WAISTE YOUR $$$,The stove heated up very quickly but no matter what car I tried to use it in it kept blowing the lighter fuse. Also the plastic handle broke in less than a months time and I had only tried to use it about 2 times prior to that. I only used it about 3 to 4 times because I got tired of the fuses blowing out in my vehicle. I was very disappointed with this product.
5,Great Intro to this Topic,"I had to get this book for a class, but am very happy I was introduced to these theories. I'd recommend it for anyone interested in the topic of where online media is going."
3,no 16 page guide,one reason i selected this item was the guide.My father was a scout for I co 23rd Inf 2nd Division.I have the stories and looked to see the ground
5,Great book & value!,"I originally found this book at one of the big chain booksellers for $25, this one was a fraction of that cost & was in like-new condition. Book contains lots of illustraions & information about a war that few know very much about. I've always enjoyed these DK books & was glad to get it at such a low price!"
4,"Rich graphics, great sweep, but no proofreading.",Great graphics and excellent photographs. A comprehensive view of the war including all theatres. But too many typos and careless mistakes in the text make one wonder what other errors one is missing.
5,World War I by HP Wilmott,"I highly recommend this book for all readers whose interests include The Great War. It is an exceptionally well written book that provides an excellent overview of World War I and the immediate aftermath. The narrative is supported by excellent photographs and concise,color-enhanced maps of all the major offensives, many of which are augmented with color-coded chronological charts. Further clarity is added by the inclusion of sections dealing with the poets, novelists, and artists of the period."
4,Very thorough about current water filtration methods,If you ever plan on buying a water filter of any kind -- this is the book to read. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I wish it would have given more specific information regarding name brand water filtration systems available and where to get testing information etc.
3,OBSIDIAN SINGLE REMIXES,The single gives better versions than the album song. Fluke remix is probably the strongest. Would recommend to any Banco De Gaia fan. Reminds me of F.S.O.L. (Future Sound of London) and E.A.R. (Experimental audio research).
3,Could've done without it,"Good but not great set of remixes, done by various people, from the last album. But I keep thinkingThe Old Formula: make a few successful records and then make a best of/compilation.The New Formula: Only one record? No problem just do a remix; ...Wish I'd have waited around until this was used and cheap."
5,dont listen to the other reviews!,"okay, so i got this item for my dog, yes my DOG, she is fussy and hates to have her nails clipped and I for one am deathly afraid of clipping her nails too short and hurting her, so i've gone to weekly peticures on all her paws, the unit is sturdy, the bits are great and of course if you apply too much pressure it will stop turning, this is a nail file and buffer, not a dremmel. the charge lasts week after week, and it is worth the money. don't let those other reviewers throw you off b/c they say ""oh its too weak!"" or ""Oh! when you press hard it stops turning"" NO KIDDING!? like i said, its a buffer, not a DREMMEL tool! don't hesitate to buy this item, it works like a charm :)"
1,Sadistic instrument of pain,"My wife got one of these and typically decided to try it out giving me a pedicure. I have since learned to dread the sound of that whinning motor even more than a dentist's drill. Unless you keep it in continous motion and a at a PERFECT angle, the rapid rotation causes friction which burns your nail (and or skin) and causes intense, sharp pain. You might as well run to your tool box and put an electric drill or dremmel with a sanding disk on your hands and feet.Do not throw away your money on this thing unless you plan to use it for filing plastic or anything not atttached to a human being.-"
1,Not suitable for human nails,I agree with the reviews from the other reviewers. It basically ruined my nails the first time I used it. However what I did discover is that this is an excellent products for keeping my dogs claws trimmed. After trimming their claws you often get rough edges. I now use this manicure kit to smooth the edges and keep their claws short. They don't seem to mind it becuase it is very quiet. I must state that I will never again use this product for my own nails.
4,Be proud of your finger nails and your toe nails,I used to spend at least $ 20.00 a month for a manucurist to 'do' my nailsI decided I could do almost as good a job if I bought this little item.....I got it and the more I use it the better I get at doing my nails..the partI enjoy most is I get compliments on my nails all the time and it has cost me nothing for my nails to look great. With the economy like it is why spend any money you don't HAVE to...but you don't have to look shabby either.Gelene Matonti
3,Update on the Homedics Style Spa Ultra Deluxe Manicure & Pedicure Kit,I bought this product last year and could not get it to work (even after charging it). Not too long ago I tried it again before throwing it awaay. Ureka! this time it worked.
1,Doesn't do a thing.,"This thing didn't have enough power to even take the tiniest bit off of my soft, natural nails. It was even more useless on acrylics. I threw this junk away and bought a Dremel tool and some professional nail attachments for it instead!"
5,great Christian music for the ENTIRE family,Our entire family loves this CD. The songs are fun and inspiring. The acapella mix is fabulous. We rock out to this music!
2,You get what you pay for,"This deal was too good to be true. Of course I wasn't expecting any name brand stuff here, but at least I expected them to all work. I don't know if I got a bad earbud or what, but it adds static and noise and therefore cannot be used.The case I didn't need, but it does fit well and looks to be decently constructed. The power adapter seems to work fine. So basically I spent $9.99 and am only using the power adapter. I guess that's a good enough deal. I think I'll go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbud/headset though."
1,do not buy it !,"I agree on ""it was too good to be true"" statement for this package.The material used for earbud and the charger is really cheap !. Thecharger melted in the car after a sunny day, I couldn't even test it. Earphone quality is not good as well, giving a constant humming noise. The case is the best out of these three so far. So one out of three for 10 bucks. I am not recommending anyone to buy this item."
2,Bad cover for a nokia phone,I wouldn't recommend this product to any one. The phone cover really sucks. I just used this product for a month....and the clip cover peeled off....really disappointed with this purchase.
2,Car Charger Doesn't Fit,"The case and ear bud are fine, but the car charger I was sent doesn't even fit my Nokia 6230. That was the main reason I bought this package."
5,Aloha! from Maui No Ka Oi,My true blue girlfriend had made it her mission in life to get me hooked on Peter White and her persistence finally paid off! I'm not your typical dyed in the wool jazz fan but this C.D. went beyond my wildest expectation of easy listening jazz. I'm now a confirmed fan of Peter White; his music is a great introduction into the wonderful world jazz. I love his music!
4,Good for instrumental recording.,"I play acoustic guitar, djembe, and viola, and this mic works wonderfully for all three. One thing to keep in mind- if using the mini plug to plug directly into a computer, make sure that your soundcard settings are NOT ajusted for an alternate microphone, but be sure to use the mic boost feature (if your soundcard supports it). Also, unless the mic will be less than 5 feet from the instrument, make sure you have a good hiss reduction filter with your recording software (but that's a given). Best results are to plug mic into a mixer, run mixer to a computer.Overall, still my best mic."
4,@ss Kicking!,"This cd is awesome. My favorite is Deepsky's contribution. Overall great cd. There isn't any vocals, which some people might not like but I don't really care."
1,Not crazy about it,I want to dis Oprah's list big time for touting this book. I should have known better because I can count on one hand the books I have liked she recommends. This is a another clunker. I can't even review it. Terrible. One star for the cover photographer.
4,Oriental and futuristic!,"Wonderful ,especially ""Emergence""...it would be much better without those human voices that somehow break the meditative mood.Still a great album."
5,Wonderful,"This is a fabulous book. I got it because I was interested in doing something different for my hair that was beginning to thin and taking forever to grow. I kept an open mind and boy I was in for a surprise. Learning the lunar cycles has improved so many aspects of my family from our health to gardening and even cleaning the house. The information found in Moon Time is very valuable and I highly recommend this book as it will improve the way you live. Yes, cutting my hair in Leo and not washing when the moon is in Pisces and Cancer has improved my hair!"
3,it's ok,"It's ok. Not quite what I expected. Seller was good though ! I just wanted more of explanations about the cycles of the moon, not what to eat or not"
3,Preachy and a bit silly,"I first about this film after reading an interview with Anna Friel and became curious and started searching for a video release. I just happened upon it one day. The story is somewhat contrived and is at its weakest when it tries to preach non-conformity and freedom of choice among the young people, when ultimately they realize the only choices they have are different types of confirmity. That probably makes no sense, but now you how I felt after watching this movie. And hey, Anna Friel looks great naked."
2,Art for the Sake of Art..,"""The Tribe"" is one of those films that the viewer watches and thinks, ""Hmm, this is just too artsy for me.""A London-based cult/sect/council is encroaching upon a potential real-estate goldmine for a local businessman, Jamie (Jeremy Northam). Jamie manages to ingratiate himself with the group's leader Emily (Joely Richardson) and finds that he is in the midst of a free-love and free-thinking group of individuals. Each has a very different mindset (especially wild-child, Lizzie, played by Anna Friel), but they manage to only convey a retread, hippie lifestyle to the viewer.I initially watched this only because of Jeremy Northam and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, but was completely drained by the time I reached the ending. It is pretentious beyond belief, but if the viewer is into art for the sake of art, it's worth at least one viewing. 2 stars."
4,good 4 price,"Nice look works best on an old car with flat hood, we put on mini van and works well, probably need two for full sized sedan, material is more like foam than regular dynamat"
3,Better than Nothing,"Installed it in an Acura Integra GSR, a car not known for a quiet cabin. Fun to drive but eventually the noise takes a toll. I had no problem cutting the material or installing it. It was not however as effective as another product I used on an earlier Integra. That product lacked a foil cover, but was heavier and seemed to be more effective.But as the title says, it is better than nothing."
2,Overrated and overpriced,"I was skeptical about this product but based on the fact that my 2011 VW Touareg had no hood insulation installed as standard and created significant road noise on the interstate, I figured it was worth a try. The install was a bit tricky as unless you remove the hood, you are faced with applying the product to the hood at the usual open angle. You get one shot at this... once the backing paper is removed, you stick it once and you're done so any mistakes will be costly.The good news is that it significantly reduces the heat emitted from the engine to the hood. This will hopefully help preserve the paint. The not so good news is that I can hear absolutely no appreciable reduction in road noise which was extremely disappointing. I would have been disappointed to pay $30 for this so to pay double that makes this an extremely overrated product. Would not recommend in any way."
2,It will not effectively reduce engine noise.,"I have only noticed a small difference in the engine noise. If for example, the engine noise of your car was rated at Volume 30 on your stereo, it would probably be at 25 with the Dynamat Hoodliner. Do not expect this to reduce much noise at all. I believe the best way to reduce engine noise is by adding the Hoodliner onto the firewall that covers the engine, but unfortunately this is a much harder task than just peeling a mat and sticking it under the hood.Does it reflect heat? I can sure feel heat on the mat, so I could assume that it does help protect the paint on the hood cover.The mat and foam is very thick compared to the regular dynamats, so needless to say, I was disappointed that it did not reduce the engine noise significantly."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this product along with the basemat to try to soften the engine noise in my 91 civic, but it does not seem to deaden the sound that comes through to the cabin. I installed under the hood and installed the basemat on the fire wall and floorboards according to the instructions. The hood closes with a nice solid THUD now, which is nice, but the engine noise level is not dampened. I will not buy this product again nor recommend it."
3,Not 100% what I expected,"First off this is not an actual dynamat product, not a huge deal with me but could be with others. The adhesive on this product is terrible, I am waiting for the day when I open my good and it is sitting on too of my engine. It's does what it is supposed to in block heat/noise but I question the durability of the adheaive"
5,Does what's described well,"I have 2 of these. Use it almost every day for about 10 hours. Considering this duty cycle, both lamps had their bulbs last a good 2.0-2.5 years. I only bought the second one because I had a very tough time finding a replacement bulb for the first one. Now the 2nd one has burnt out and I happened to find replacement bulbs :TrueColor TC10002 / T13330 13-Watt Ott-Lite Replacement Bulb."
2,Full Spectrum desk lamp,I just recieved this lamp. I am not happy with the fact that the shade will only work in the position shown on the display. If you want it lower it will slowly close and the light will go out. This displayed position creates too much light directly into my eyes. This lamp would be (Would be) great if the shade had an adjusting implement on the side to hold it in a desired position. It is a great reading lamp and I love the vision max. Everything is clear and bright and very easy to see. So I will keep the lamp. Oh well!
1,Hmmmmm,Just saw this on the Walmart website for 21 dollars. Thought I'd help out and save someone some money if they're looking to buy this particular lamp. Haven't tried it so I don't know if it works.
1,The Worst,I cannot believe all the good reviews on this lamp. I had mine all of 3 weeks when it died. It was not from the bulb burning out (I replaced the bulb because I thought that was what was wrong). It just died. My nephew (a stage lighting tech) finally took it apart for me to check the wiring and connections and the thing looked intact: it just didn't work. I cannot recommend this product at all. Maybe I got the only lemon in the pack but that's enough to keep me away from investing in another one. I'm giving it one star just for the idea. It is a good idea yielding poor results in my reality.
3,Interesting compilation from some informative perspectives,Giblin selected some pretty good writers to review the 20th century. What he ended up with was an informative volume with sections here and there that summarized the century so well and so succinctly that it becomes obvious that the author put a great deal of time and research into analyzing that particular slice of American life. The book is at least worth skimming through for those occasional gems of revelation and insight.
2,What a pain to install,"This product would be so much easier to use if the holes for the screws wern't slotted. I was installing my 6x9's on upright brackets, and holding kicker 6x9, the grill and this thing was impossible to line up. This thing just kept falling off as i was line it up. UGH! I guess you get what you pay for. Overall, if your installing your speakers right side up, it'd work fine i guess."
4,Tight Than a Mug,"This CD is tight. Just the first two cuts alone solidify this album as nice than a mug. The idiot that said this album ain't nice is clearly a white boy. Stick to red hot chilli peppers baller, cuz this album is the shizzy! Especially... ""Everlasting Yay!"""
1,Awful not one good song,This is the worst cd I have heard that has ever come out of GA. There are no good songs on this album.... I can't believe Pastor Troy actually puts his name on this album at all it is just a waste.
3,Pleasant Collection of Alt Pop & Chill Tracks,"This might have the art work of a dance chill CD but it's really more of a chill or alt pop CD. The choices are pleasant and all professional but they are not really for a dance mix and they are not background chill, more like A3 alt pop - pleasant, nice and solid but nothing great and not much of a mix."
5,Very good - Powerful - Motivational,"By reading this book she gives people hope that you can over come lifes badluck. Through taking charge of her life and realizing she wanted her life back. Losing weight, working out, help from a friend Iris. Its a empowering story that gives me hope for me."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!,"Extremely P'd Off!!! I ordered these on Friday Feb. 10th. and got suckered into subscribing to Amazon Prime with the expectation of having 2 Day delivery.(I wanted these by Feb. 14th)So my Fiance was waiting by the door like a puppy for a week! Finally got these Sh***y diamonds on Feb.17th.Now my expectations were not too high considering the price.But, I was hoping they would at least look like eachother.One was noticeably bigger and cloudy,with what appears to be black sand throughout.The other was smaller ,more yellow with a big piece of ""black sand"" toward the bottom.These do not shine at all! I wouldn""t let my dog wear these!Not even worth the box they came in!I'll be sending these back,cancelling my Prime account,and visiting Overstock a little more!Amazon you suck!"
2,Very small with a black spot on one,I was surpised at the size (small) when I got them. Diamonds did not look that great either and one had a black dot on the inside of the diamond. Sent them back immediately.
2,disappointed,if I wanted mediocre quality for this price I could've gone to virtually any jewelry store. I thought one of the advantages of shopping on Amazon was a better deal. I guess when it comes to shopping for jewelry I'll stick with my local gemologist.
1,earrings were mix matched,"I had bought these earrings for my daughter and was very disappointed when they arrived. One earring was very noticeably larger than the other. although my money was quickly refunded upon the return of the earrings, I am very apprehensive about ordering jewelry through Amazon from now on."
2,"Not great, but worth the gamble.","Shipping was great as always with Amazon. However, the stones almost looked like rocks instead of diamonds. Very gray in color. I purchased these because the description showed them having similar diamond qualities to earrings that I previewed at a local jeweler. With similar qualities, the diamonds at the jeweler sparkled and were crystal clear, so for substantially less, I tried the Amazon Earrings. The diamonds from Amazon were dull, had visible large inclusions and were just all together unappealing. For the price, I figured I would give it a shot as some of the reviews were great and some were bad. Clearly I got one of the bad batches. I'd suggest chancing it if you have the time to wait for shipping. I ended up spending $200 more on the nicer looking earrings, so if you get lucky and get one of the nice pairs I have read about from Amazon, it would be well worth the gamble of the shipping charge. Don't be shocked if you get some ugly earrings though."
2,DIAMOND EARINGS,Earring are very grey in color and of poor quality. No sparkle at all. Would not recomend purchasing. Ended up returning.
2,A Boat Anchor,"The watch works well. I liked the simplicity, the look and the vibration alarm. I can't hear the typical alarm watch. I can feel a vibration! But I feel like I,m wearing a big weight. Too much, and I'm no weak armed guy."
2,Wouldn't buy again,"As others said, it is heavy and large....doesn't bother me though and I'm just an average joe. My main complaints are it's poor workmanship. The first one I got stopped working after two weeks. The mechanism broke so the hands stopped moving. I returned it and got a second. It was great for a month or two, but I noticed one thing in general: you set the vibrating alarm by pulling out the bottom knob...but it's easy to accidentally push it back in again unawares so that the alarm never goes off. An alarm watch that is unreliable becomes worthless. Then this one's back light went out. So I've stopped wearing it....it's too heavy for an ordinary watch.I LOVE the vibrating alarm...if I find another watch with the same feature I'll probably get it. But perhaps not from Timex."
5,Great New Dish!,"I've had this a week or so, and really like it. I've used it in the microwave and then as an eating dish, to keep my food warm while I take my time eating. The instructions say not to use it on the stovetop, and that does make sense. What I really wanted it for is microwave and eating, and it's just great for that. The extra space in it makes it easy to stir my food thoroughly, but it's not so deep as to be hard to eat from. So far it has washed perfectly every time. And is a wonderful cheery color!"
4,A beautifully written page-turner,"Packed with atomsphere (life of American's living in Colombia), characters, tensions and romance, this is a book I couldn't put down until I finished it at three in the morning. A real tour de force and one I would recommend to anyone looking for fiction with substance and fascination fascination."
2,Recipes just didn't work !,"I am a seasoned cook and have worked with several Indian cookbooks and I tried a couple of recipes in this book. They didn't work for me. The Okra stir-fry was terribly overspiced- I had to throw it out and the Yogurt soup was just ok.Others who have reviewed the book on this site seemed to like it but I don't know......They didn't seem much quicker than other Indian recipes. Once you get the hang of it, they never take too long."
2,Good performance; Poor recording,"A quite musical performance of well known works. However, the mikes must have been placed in kettle drums to accomplish this distorted recording. I have a very effective system for SACD and, with the exception of this unfortunate recording, has been a thrill to listen to. I suggest that any other prospective buyer select another recording of these works."
5,Wide dynamic; Need high-end system to extract the dynamic,"Due ot its wide dynamic, the soft passage may sound too low on certain systems and the loud may be distorting.The music comes alive with B&W speakers driven by Mark Levinson 333 Amp."
4,A Valuable Study Guide,"I cannot imagine getting through my exam study for corporations without this guide. It gives a very clear explanation of the topics that were covered in class. It is very helpful to people only taking corporations because of the bar exam rather than a specific interest in practicing in this area. One caveat - unlike some other outlines, this text does not specifically brief any cases, so it is still essential to keep up with the text and attend class."
3,"Comprehensive, but unbelievably out of date.","This book simplifies corporations law and gives concrete examples and good summaries.However, be aware that the book is in many places completely out of date and cites sections of statutes that were changed 12 years ago (even though this edition was published in 2002). You'll have to check constantly in your statutory supplement and in your case book to make sure that what you're reading is up-to-date.It's hard to understand, really, how an author could fail to update sections of a book over such a long period especially an author with a law degree who is, therefore, giving outdated legal advice).That all being said, the meat of the book is well done."
3,Good for meditation,I liked these cards more for meditation than oracular work. It explanded my understanding of the hebrew alphabets as such. It was not exactly what i had expected but I did find it enlightening as many interesting insights came to me while reading and working with these cards.
1,Horrible!!!!,"The ""foam"" is the equivalent of kneeling on a hardwood floor. A piece of utterly useless junk!!!"
5,d--n good recording,"I listen to this recording at least once a day in between my booker little and lee morgan,art blakey listenings.What a fresh and exciting,sentimental,fiery live recording this one is tops,peace!"
4,Great Music !,"If you are new to Woody Shaw's music.....Start with this CD.Woody Shaw's music can be complex; CDs like Blackstone Legacy, Song of Songs can be difficult for new listeners. Woody Shaw is one of the last great trumpeters gone too soon."
3,Just Be Aware,"Great album but just be aware that the song ""Theme For Maxine"" is only one minute long (that was partially the song that I bought the album for)."
4,Another winner from Mary Brown!,"While not quite as good as her previous Book, The Unlikely Ones, this book is still a fun and entertaining book about the adventures of a group of misfits and ugly ducklings.It features an overweight heroine, Summer, who inherits a magic ring from her unknown father when her mother, the village ""kept woman"", dies. She is given the choice of taking over her mother's job, or leaving, so she leaves to find her own way in the world.The mysterious ring allows her to communicate with animals and she acquires an oddball entourage of a smart mouthed, know it all dog, a broken-down horse, a crippled pigeon, a battered tortoise, and a flying pig. She rescues a blind, amnesiac knight, whom she falls for. Everyone changes greatly over the course of the story--especially that flying pig, and the end is not quite what you expect it to be. I really enjoyed reading a book that features an overweight heroine--you don't see those too often!"
2,reads like a pastiche if not parody of earlier work,"I'm sorry, but this book seemed like little more than a pale imitation of the author's earlier and far superior ""The Unlikely Ones."" Again we have an ""ugly duckling"" heroine, again we have a flawed nobleman/knight who learns to respect and appreciate women, AGAIN we have a collection of disparate animals (some of whom don't even contribute to the plot this time). Sudden plot twists are nice, but we need a little FORESHADOWING to make them acceptable; the sudden turn in male leads was disorienting. And, perhaps it was the length, but the examination of medieval society was too simplistic. Ms. Brown is a very good writer, but she fell short here; it is too soon for her to be imitating herself so blatantly."
5,When you're looking for some adventure.......,"I don't usually read books on a whole but my brother suggested this one so I thought I might as well try it out.It was absolutely amazing; i couldn't put it down after. It was refreshing having a stong heroine that I could identify with as the main character. I also paused many times to read over and over certain phrases that stuck out in my mind. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, even a non reader like myself!"
4,basic pain book,"this book is well written and well organized but also very basic and kind of expensive for what it offers. useful for the internist or junior anesthesia resident - if you are doing anesthesia or pain as a specialty, this seems to fall short... the MGH pain book requires more effort to read but also has considerable more info and is more appropriate if you are looking for an abridged pain text..."
3,Beware one size,"The tights themselves are of good quality. I'm 5'4"", 125 lbs and I found that they were a little tight, so beware of the one size thing. They fit though, but thank goodness I wasn't taller. My issue with the tights is that they are a little on the orange side and do not look good with the typical Christmas red color. Secondly, they say opaque, which I took to mean that they were thick and not see through, but the tops are completely see through. I'd been hoping I wouldn't need to wear shorts over them, when wearing a short santa dress, but you could see everything. I didn't end up wearing them."
5,High quality,"I was very pleased with these tights, purchased as part of a costume. They are a high quality knit, and did not shrink or lose color in washing. I'll definitely order from Sheer Delight again."
5,YOU CAN'T SLOW HIM DOWN,"as always rory is best live.messin' with the kid & going to my home town stand out.the 2 bonus tracks:hoodoo man,bullfrog blues make it well worth the money.BUY IT!"
4,Great for the price but could be better,"This cabasa is a great choice for those who are looking for good quality with low cost. However, if you want a really nice cabasa, look around at the more expensive ones. I'm an amateur musician, and this is the first cabasa I've purchased. It's good, but I can't say that I'm impressed.It has a comfortable handle, and the beads rotate easily around the metal. I agree with another reviewer that the metal underneath the beads doesn't look like it's very good quality. Also, the cabasa that I received is completely black. It does not have the wood-colored stain like the picture shows.For the price, this is a great deal and a lot of fun to play :)"
4,Pretty good,"Since it's probably the only pulaar-english dictionary in the world, it's also probably the best. But it's really pretty bare-bones and needs a lot of filling in."
3,"interesting, but...","not as intriguing as i expected.many phrases only vaguely resemble what they're alleged to be.still, interesting listen (albeit a one-time only listen).guess i wanted to be scared more.."
5,Essential,"Gjallarhorn (pronounced ""Yal-lar-horn""), The band is Finnish, but hails from a Swedish-speaking area on the West Coast of Finland, a fringe geographical area where 50% of the people speak Swedish and the music remains Swedish in character. Most of their repertoire is the folk music of these Swedish-speaking Finns, from the unique minuets and ballads that have only survived in Ostrobothnia, to the oldest traditional waltzes.The narrative of Gjallarhorn's songs spring primarily from Nordic mythology. The Gjallarhorn is the horn with which the gatekeeper god, Heimdal, sent messages from the gods of Asgrd to the mortals of Midgrd. The name of the horn is related to the word gjala, which means 'to shout' or 'to sing out.'--This CD is essential in every world-music fan collection--Five solid gold stars."
5,Such a beautiful celebration of the Goddess...,"is captured in the incredible vocal stylings of Jenny Wilhelm. The goddess fills her and sings through her. Gjallarhorn is a rich and potent broth of swedish-finnish myth, legend, folk music...as well as world music elements, such as didjeridoo and tabla drums. This music is beautifully and resoundingly pagan, alive, and voluptuous in its expression. Let the magic of this cd enter your world and reawaken the primeval heart of spring within you."
4,Superb fiddle styles...again!,"I gave this one a 4 because I would rate the earlier album, Ranarop, one notch higher than this one, though a couple of tracks, (especially Ye Ride So Carefully, and the Icelandic chant) deserve the highest rating. The authentic techniques are there, but I feel that the album was a little over-produced. Still unsullied by those New-Age/World Music editors, though. Also, unlike Ranarop, Sjofn's texts aren't printed in their orignal tongues. This, to me, is a travesty..."
4,Very fresh...,"I actually give this cd about 4.3 stars. It was very eclectic and surprising...as well, it was very thought provoking. It makes for quite a pleasant and mystical listen, with only a few songs that i find less enjoyable. I am very fond of its mythical yet historical landscapes, and its brilliant and unexpected instrumentations (except when there are too many fiddles used in a certain way;)But this is certainly an album you should own for all its great moments such as Suvetar, Sinivasta (which samples dolphin calls), Lila Dansa...and many more!(I as well enjoy the use of icelandic lyrics for one of the songs.)This is a great example of Nordic music."
4,These are .040 moly rings,"The term ""Premium"" certainly doesn't tell you squat but I am pretty sure they are moly and not chrome because they don't have the ""C"" designation like E251KC40. Not plasma moly I guess, just coated moly. I got this info from Jegs reference to them."
4,A strength book,"The book is divided into theme groupings such as biology, astronomy, sociology etc. It works on the assumption that the reader will put forth the effort to do all the exercises and match the answers. Checking your answers however is a major hassle because the numbering system and the organization of the answer key is not user friendly at all. Best bet is to photocopy the answer sheet and lay it next to you as you work.The book's strength is its thematic presentation as opposed to an alphabetical presentation.My advice, get Kaplan's success with words for the Toefl first and then get this book second."
3,hmmm,When I bought this dish I had high hopes from the previous reveiws however within five days the paint inside of the dish itself had began to flake off. I then had to scrub out the paint with steel wool. Would. Be an. Amazing water dish if better suited paint was used
2,You know what they say about sequels...,"Definitely not as good as the List of 7. Sparks's fall is very disappointing and, I think, unnecessary to the story. It takes away from his being the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes."
2,Muddled follow-up to a decent story,"The List of Seven wasn't great, but it was a fun, entertaining read. I immediately picked up The 6 Messiahs. What a disappointment! Too many characters doing too little, no real focus, a muddled and flat ending that leaves far too many loose ends. Readable, but it doesn't surprise me that there's never been a third book in the series."
1,"Good quality bootleg, not worth the price","I own one of these (thankfully I didn't pay 270 dollars for it)Bottom line is that it's a bootleg and while it is a very good one, it is not worth the asking price.If you can find one for 20 dollars or less, go for it.I really like the lyric sheet, though."
2,cheap construction,"I was disappointed with the 3-piece starter kit for Nokia 3220. The vinyl casing was not constructed with the cut-outs in the proper positions (i.e., the camera hole was on the opposite side; the casing covered the phone too tightly, which made pressing buttons a bit of a challenge). The ear piece doesn't work consistently and it broke the first day I used it (with the camera covered by the vinyl casing). I haven't tried the portable power charger, so I cannot comment on it. Overall I was disappointed with the package I received."
3,First Review,"this book was an indepth look at the life of J. Edgar Hoover of the FBI. It goes into great depth on his life and his services in the FBI. It is a source for information, however the writing is a bit slow at firslt. overall a great book though!"
3,Sony computer speakers,Very small which I what I wanted but I'm disappointed in the sound quality. Shipped promptly and packaged nicely.
4,"Hmmm, so who knew part of this thing would be plastic...","Didn't have time to do much research on these adapters, needed one ASAP, ...and the price seemed pretty good for the Dewalt so I ordered it. Now in my hands, I see what looks like a metal casting in the pictures is actually a plastic shroud over what I do suspect (and hope) is a metal bit release somewhere underneath this plastic shroud.I can't say if this is actually a bad design or not, or if it will stand the test of time, ...just not what I would expect to find on an extension/ adapter piece to a hammer drill."
2,"Okay, but not amazing","I used this book in an education literacy class in my undergraduate degree. At the time I was a music education major and struggled to make the class apply to my area of expertise to begin with. I read most of the book and while I found it somewhat interesting, I also found it quite abstract. Unfortunately I don't think the book is built around a wealth of content to begin with. That and the fact that it's really not readable (which textbooks really can be) and hard to glean hard and fast facts or useful ideas are why I give the book such a low review. I liked it enough to keep it instead of selling it back, but honestly haven't picked it up for 5 years, and don't foresee doing so anytime soon."
3,A good support book,I purchased this book for my stepson as he prepared for his ACT exam. He was already in AP English. I also purchased the Princeton Review for the ACT. He used this book in conjunction with the Princeton Review. He said it targets the average student. He didn't have to stretch his skills to answer the questions. He did like the fact that it was a quick read.
2,Not enough content for an A student,"This book is helpful for maybe a C student.... my daughter is an A student and this book had a very few useful tips for her. The passages in the back of the book were helpful, but I wouldn't buy this book if your child is an A student"
4,It's alright,"They had some useful tips, and it doesn't take long to complete... I used this along with a class so I'm not sure what to attribute my reading score too... (I did very well in reading ;) )"
4,A good LED lantern,"A friend and I bought 9 of these lanterns and the only problem was a bad latch on one case, which was quickly resolved. A new set of batteries lasted 28 days 24/7. The light is typical for LED's."
3,Looks OK so far...,"Guide Gear stuff is generally pretty good, and the price is right. I got this lantern for the inevitable Chicago summer power failure, which didn't happen this year. It seems adequate, and I like the LED idea - a heat source is not what you want when it's 95 outside and the AC is dead. :=( I'm sure it will fulfill that purpose, but it seems a bit flimsy as stated above for an expedition into the wilderness. Worth the money, and the case is very good - if a bit bulky. I wouldn't rely on this as my only emergency light source. But then, I'm into survival redundancy. Redundancy. Red... Oh you get it :=))"
2,Not as bright as I expected...,"If you're expecting to light a room, this isn't the lamp for you. I was a little disappointed, but not enough to return it..."
3,"Great lantern, but handle broke second time used","This is a great LED lantern. I gives a lot of light, and the batteries last forever. I once accidently left it on for two days in the case, and there was no dimming of the batteries at all after 48 hours. However, the plastic handle broke the second time I used the lantern in a way that can't be fixed. I would recommend that you purchase the aluminum version of this lantern ASIN: B000F44Q7Y instead."
3,"Underwhelming Light, Cheap Plastic Handles, Long Life","I own 4 of these. They all have light output that is usuable as a nightlight-type lamp. The handles on two units broke the first time I used them. For the number of LEDs I expected more light. Yet, the light that does shine from the units is diffused in a way so that it's actually difficult to read from, and hard on the eyes. The one thing I'll say is that they will shine for more two days with enough light to use in an emergency (with fully-charged batteries). If you want something to use for more than a nightlight, I'd pass on these. If, you want high-quality casings, pass on these. If you don't care about those two issues, then, the long-life of the light that is put out may give you reason to pick them up. In hindsight, I would not buy these again at the price I paid."
1,Poor Customer Service & Flimsy Design,"My issues are not so much with the lantern itself, but with the supplier, Sportman's Guide..... The lantern is NOT stocked by Amazon.When I received the lantern, a plastic pin attaching the handle to lantern was broken. This defect was mentioned by another reviewer, Outglare. The latches on the lantern case were also rather flimsy.I decided to exchange the lantern and waited for a pre-paid mailing label before I sent it back. After several weeks I received my ""exchange"". I noticed the ""re-sealed"" box and imagine my surprise when I received the same lantern with the broken handle back again.I have given up on the ""high tech"" LED solution and next time I'll buy a good old Coleman fluorescent at my local Walmart."
5,Great lantern for family camping,"I bought this item for a family camping trip this past summer. Overall, we were very happy with the lantern.It was rugged enough for our needs, and the amount of light it produces is excellent. We read by it, and also used it to light our whole camping area.Definitely recommended."
3,New life for an old laptop,"The product arrived on time and as advertised. The battery is physically slightly larger than original but fits perfectly nevertheless. Exact connection fit and charges well, bringing new life to an old laptop used for the basics. Thanks again"
1,Hogwash!,"It is a travesty to believe that someone outside a scientific background could even suggest a cure / treatment for AIDS that would eradicate it from a human body. It is also alarming to me that a publisher would use such a lack of scrutiny as to allow this kind of garbage to be published.Unbelievable!I have cared for so many patients with HIV / AIDS in my profession, and would NEVER suggest this kind of diatribe for them to read. False hope, unfounded and unsupported references, and puregarbage is what this book holds.Look for the next book in this series: ""UFOs and Aliens - living with us at home."""
5,The Universe Has Changed!,"'member how surgeons scoffed at the idea of washing their hands, and 'engineers' scoffed (before the Transistor Age) at electronic crystals? Well here we go again Mr and Mrs. Scoffer---Parasites are the Storm Troopers,the Evil Spirits, the Fly in the Ointment of our HEALTH!Clark boldly goes where (few) men have gone before. I researched her work, and although she is not alone, others like her have been censored by the scoffers.Clark has 100 case histories that defy healthy skepticism, and pave the way towards what I believe to be the point in all her books:SELF HEALING.This book is as complete as any book should be that makes such a profound claim: diagrams, explanations, case histories, equipment, alternatives, recipes, sources, etc.,.Life has in it a cure for HIV/AIDS, its unbelievably low cost, and can soon be in your hands to benefit you and those you love the most. Please own this godsend!"
4,The views expressed in general,I've just started reading the book and I must admit that I never read a book like this all my life. It's one of its own kind and I'm so impressed to hear the author expressing her views without fear of being victimised. This is the information the average person would like to know and has been held back by the so called professionals. It is very well true that the traditional ways of curing diseases and looking after ones health are now looked down upon by the mordern authorities and this has resulted in millions and millions of people falling on the death trap as a result of ailments that can be managed or well treated.
2,Bulova Cranbrook Wall Chime Clock,"This is a nice looking small wall clock. However, there is no night silencer or volume adjuster for the chime. There is simply an on/off switch for the chime. The chime sounds like a door bell instead of a traditional clock chime. I expected more from Bulova, but it is still a handsome piece."
3,Needs more specific description of clock,"I would have liked to have known this clock does not chime on the hour and half hour before I purchased it.It only plays Westminster Chimes every hour. Had I known this, I would not have purchased it. Very disappointed. Seller should have stated ONLY plays Westminster Chimes on the hour."
4,Chime clock,"I think the clock is beautifully made. My only disappointment was that, when the clock chimes the hour, it doesn't chime what the hour is. Other than that, we enjoy it."
1,"chime works, pendulum works, has never told time","clock looks beautiful but has never told time.........very very disappointed.....expected much more from Bulova......think having plastic parts and being made in China isn't a good idea yes the chimes work, yes the pendulum works, hardly enough."
2,Two corner edges were damaged prior to shipment.,"Two corner edges of this clock had been damaged prior to shipment. A replacement could not be sent. The damage could be touched up with a brown marker, so I decided not to send the clock back, as it is a Wedding gift. Not sure I would be a to find a replacement gift in time for the Wedding.The appearance of the clock is beautiful, however the quality of the sound is not that pleasing. The cadence of the Westminster chime is a bit fast.The description describes this clock as solid wood, but the carving are actually plastic.Overall I am disappointed with this purchase. Probably should not have made such a purchase online."
3,great tv and film detectives,It didn't include many of the really great recent detectives and many of the stories included were either from so long ago that most people now don't remember them or they weren't that great to begin with. There were a few exceptions though.
3,Ehhh...,"Started out good, sounded like it was going right, only to find out it makes a left, then veers slightly to either side, then... I don't know... I guess the ""Does Your Mama Know"" crowd knows better than I, oh well."
1,Tiny tiny and tiny,"While I realize that .10 oz of perfume wouldn't be a large bottle, this was ridiculously small and so I sent them back. No problem with my return but I would never purchase this type of item again."
4,A different setting.,I enjoyed reading this book. I am more familiar with Maggie Sefton's books about knitting. The story line in Dying to Sell was interesting and kept me involved.
2,Boring,"I just couldn't get into this book. It looked to be a reasonable premise, but soon it seemed like things happened because the author was pulling the strings, rather than because of any natural motivation of the characters. Ultimately the book failed my test of, ""Do I care what happens to these people?"" The answer was no, so I quit reading the book and asked Amazon for a refund."
1,a total disappointment!,"I bought this product thinking it would be a fun, healthy way to bake donuts at home for my family. I am an avid cook and baker and to me it looked like fun, until I tried it! The donuts stick to the pans terribly and you have to mutilate them to remove them. The pans themselves are hard to clean. As for the donuts, they taste more like a chewy muffin and do not keep well (say if you make them the night before for breakfast) I have tried several of the recipes and have been disappointed each time. I am sorry I wasted money on this product!"
3,legal,"a imagem da embalagem da uma sensao que é feita de madeira e no é. mas o box é muito bonito, apesar de que veio com algumas pequenas avarias..."
5,What an excellent box set,It's really cool. The box is beautiful and the anime series is one of the best anime's I've seen!!!
3,Not dog proof,"OK, so these collars work pretty good for the wireless containment system. My problem is that I've had to buy 6 of them so far for 3 dogs. The dogs like to grab onto each others collars and these things cannot take that kind of abuse.I wish petsafe would make the outer moulding compound more durable."
4,hidden fence replacement collars,The product shipped quicker than expected and is working great. However they were a little pricier than what Wal Mart used to sell. That is where I bought the original collars these replaced 3 years ago. Hopefully these will last longer!!!!
4,Does the job,Got as a second collar thinking it would be smaller as it was listed as lighter weight. Rather big on my small dog (see photo) but works. Delivery and price were good.
3,dog collar,after openning contents and putting collars on the dogs we found out they did not work . all batteries were dead . had to buy all new batteries thru amazon .SHOULD HAVE BEEN CREDITED .not happy .
4,My Boder Collies chew them off each other going to get the nonchew spray for them.,Instantly trained my dogs to stay off of the road. Love the product. Just wish it were made out of non dog chew able material since my dogs obsessively chew at each other collars and then I lose the transmitter. Ordered new ones and am going to get the no chew spray to hopefully keep them off of each other's collars.
3,"Good Collar, low battery life","Good collar but the battery life is not very good. Works well if your dog learns quickly, but do not get if your dog is stubborn!"
2,Not for Medium Sized outgoing dogs,This product worked really well for about 1 month. We have two 7 month German Shepard/ Chow mix one of the dogs chased a cat and ran straight though the invisible fence. Bad news for the Cat..... We now have the Stubborn dog collar on him now. We will see how that will work for him now.But if you have a low energy dog. It works Great... His brother never goes by the invisible fence. He does really well with this collar.It depends on the dog.
1,no power,the problem with this collar is that at first when my dog was a puppy he stayed in but then he got bigger and now he just runs out whenever he wants. So i had to put him on a chain and he justs sits in my back yard and can't do anything past 15yds of his chain. if you buy this make sure your dog is small enough.
1,never got it,"I never recieved the product, contacted the seller and they never answer, the contacted amazon, but never got word back. Is been 3 months and it has been the worst experience."
1,Proprietary Battery Required,"The battery only worked from June 3rd to July 4th. One Month! That's when I discovered that the collar ONLY takes PetSafe's, DISPOSABLE, proprietary, RFA-67 battery. The sales description makes it sound like PetSafe is throwing in a free battery with the new collar but doesn't explain that, unlike my other UL-275 receivers; the collar can't use standard lithium batteries from Wal*mart or K-mart. You have to buy PetSafe's battery if you want it to work for another month!"
2,Petsafe extra collar,"this product is in and of itself very nice. However, it was not compatible with my particular model of wireless fence. WHich is not, of coiurse the sellers fault. The product has no information on th packaging regarding what is it compatible with. I spoke with PetSafe rep and she informed me that as far as she knew, there is not a Universal collar made for their systems. You must putchase the correct model #."
5,Profoundly inspired and uplifting,"This CD moved me to gentle and healing tears. I have no doubt but that the Holy Spirit inspired every word. God bless John Michael Poirier for using his gift of music to touch my weary heart. If you have had an abortion, you will find this album to be a great source of consolation."
5,It is absolutely gorgeous!,"I wanted a topper that was classic, romantic, and definitely not cheesy. This topper is solid, looks great, and doesn't seem like a fad like most of the other options out there today (silver monogram letters, ""bling"" letters, etc.). These Precious Moments are perfect for a collector or anyone that wants to add a little bit of a whimsical feel to their wedding day.As another reviewer mentioned, it is a little large / heavy, but my cake artist said it should be just fine with some under support. I cannot wait to see it atop our cake on our wedding day!!"
5,"perfect to decorate a wedding cake,,,","I loved the ornament when i saw it and it is very very elegant. it is heavy but i am planning to put it on the cake table, not on the cake."
2,SSSSLLLLOOOOWWWW,"Takes a long time to make a pot of coffee. I didn't have the patiance to time it, but I would bet it would take over an hour to brew the full pot. It needs a timer so it would be ready when you wake up. It does make good coffee and it is easy to use and clean."
3,Wide and large,I purchased this for my 5 yr old son who had outgrown his helmet. This helmet is nice but too wide.
1,Think twice.,"After receiving the headphones and following the directions to charge 24 hours, they worked fine the first couple times they were used. Then I began noticing that the indicator light on the base showed the power on when they were not in use. Shortly after, the headphones started to die after a few minutes use and would not recharge even when left as long as 2 days undisturbed.Sony instructed me to send them in for service. After many, many follow-up calls I was told that my headphones could not be repaired and I would be sent a replacement. After many, many more calls Sony informed me that there were no replacements available and none expected within the foreseeable future. Sony offered me a full refund of the purchase price, which I accepted.After 3 months I am again looking for a set of wireless headphones. The Sennheiser RS-65 set looks good to me. While I applaud Sony for doing the right thing and issuing me a refund, I cannot recommend this Sony product."
4,Turn Up the Transmitter Volume,"I almost returned to seller. Went back and read the doc again. It says to turn up the volume to at least 5 or 6. After turning it up, no more problems with static."
4,Turn up the transmitter volume,"I almost returned to seller. Went back and read the doc again. It says to turn up the volume to at least 5 or 6. After turning up the MusicMatch volume on the PC, no more problems with static. Not sure if it works well with CD players."
2,Lack of tracks,I was going to buy this way back when but I decided to rent it first. Beat the game in less than an hour. Not worth the cash. At least the Xbox version has online play.
4,Good game,"I wasnt sure about this game and i blindly bought it not knowing if Id really enjoy it. It turns out that it is a very good game. It only takes a couple races to get the controls down, and the graphics are excellent. If youre not one for braking you may want to go the other direction though. It features a good number of licensed bikes but you start out with them all right off the bat so it takes away the point of competing for new ones. This is the games only downfall. Theres not enough to keep you going."
2,Bad Game,"I'm sorry for those of you who like this game, but I thought it boring and hard to play. I thought that it was hard to control and confusing to follow. My recommendation to you as a buyer is to not purchase this game."
3,not bad,"i bought this cd at wal-mart back in 2000. i just listented to it today for the first time in a few years.it has lost some of it's luster, but it's still ok. i think the best song is ""invasion over berlin""."
1,Not worth the money,Santa brought this for Christmas. It did not last two days! The mic feels nice and heavy and looks great. The problem is in the wiring. Bad design!
1,Find something else,"I accidentally came across this mic while browsing and thought, hey, I've got one like this! So just to tell you guys - don't waste your money on it, so funny that it simply doesn't pic up sound, any mic is better - your webcam's, your laptop's. And I thought Sony couldn't go wrong, lol. Cheers."
1,"poor pickup, cuts out","I have no idea why but it will be working fine then suddenly cut out and then a moment later back in. i have to have the gain on my mixer almost all the way up before it works, somehow there seems to be a threshold before it can even start to pick up. I didn't see a listing for cord length but it's too short for comfort with karaoke and the cord seems thin and flimsy. Mic itself is very cheap and flimsy feeling."
1,donnttt think about itt,its just worthless u cant hear your voice u have to shout .. and even wen u do the sound is veryy poor in quality .. the micrphones that come on any cheap headphones are muchhhhhhhhhhhh betteeerrrr .... dnt think about buying it
1,Dont be fooled by the brand,"This may be the cheapest piece of junk you can buy on amazon. After going through several replacement microphones for my karaoke machine, I thought it would be a good idea to go with a big brand name like Sony. Don't be fooled, the moment you hold it you'll know how poor the build quality is. It feels like a kids toy. You have to nearly swallow the thing for it to pick up your voice at all, there is no off switch, and the small-to-big adaptor that comes with broke nearly ruining my karaoke machine. DONT BUY IT!"
1,if there were an option for zero stars thats what i wouldve given it!,This microphone (if that's what you wanna call it) has to be the absolute worse product I have ever purchased in my entire life. You literally have to physically touch the music with your mouth with both hands cuffed around it and even then you still cant barely hear a thing even with volume on full blast. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. even if this item were a dollar I would say it isn't worth it!
3,it's cool,"i didn't expect much because it was cheap, but it works. it can be low at times but again i didn't expect some studio mic or something"
4,Dependable and CHEAP!,"So you must be in the market for a microphone if you are reading this. Depending on what you want out of a mic, this might be a great bargain choice. I recently tested 30+ of these Sony F-V100 Mics and every single one worked--nice and clean sounding in a streamlined lightweight package.Pros:Price (Under $10)Dependable--very durableGood audio qualityNo on/off switch (less to break)Lightweight (easy for kids to hold)9.8 foot cordCons:No on/off switchLow volume for some usesMostly plastic build instead of metalSo if you are looking for an easy to use and durable mic on a budget, this should be exactly what you need. If you have requirements that do not amp the mic much, then you will need a more expensive mic."
3,Good for the $$,"Purchased one of these for use with students and inexpensive DV camcorders. Works fine - sounds ok. What do you want for $10?! Is it a pro-quality mic? No, of course not - but it sure sounds much better than the on-camera microphone. Works like a charm and for my wallet."
2,This mike SUX!!!!!!!!!,"Don't by this mike.Its a piece, it cuts out, and crackles.You'd be better off going to a dollar store and finding a better mic.Save your money and buy elsewhere"
1,Sony Omnidirectional Microphone is so bad,"Sony Omnidirectional Microphone is smaller than usual one, its sound is so little whenever and whatever I adjust it to. It makes me so upset. It sucks. Don't buy it. Don't use it. It is made in china. I want to send it back to the seller for a refund or exchange of other kinds of microphone. Please help me solve it."
1,Isn't for all kareoke machines,"The procuct said it would work for any machine, it did not. You can only hear sound from it when there is no music playing. Then the music starts and nothing. I would suggest buying a mic that matches the brand of the machine purchased. Good thing it was only 10 bucks. I was really upset."
3,Not Impressed for the Sony Name,"I bought a couple of different low cost microphones from different companies and I have to say that They didnt do a good job on this model. the sound is ok however, there is more feedback than most, and the cable is extemely thin. Karaoke maybe, but dont tug on the end or you may find it just snaps off."
3,typical microphone,simply the way it is they usually sound ok at first then the slit est thing makes the noises as an user knows wanted to try and find something a little longer lasting next time
2,Not as loud as it should be ...,"does not sound great , and does not put out the same volume as the other mike I have .."
1,Sony FV-100 ominidirectional microphone,"I bought this microphone for an oral history project for school which required me to use an external microphone with a digital recorder. This microphone does not have an on/off switch which you really need for any kind of sound quality. Recordings made with the microphone were barely audible, I did much better using the built in microphone on my recorder. Do not waste your time and money on this product, it is sub par."
1,Don't buy this,"My husband bought me this microphone to replace a broken mike for my Audiostream AS 222 karaoke machine.It works - badly, so I give it one star.You can't hear anything out of this mike - it's going back to whence it came from. Buh bye!"
1,How low can you go?,"I bought it despite the warnings that the gain was very low. But I figured it was because people were using it directly into a karaoke machine. I planned on using it in my computer. Well, that wasn't good enough either. This mic needs a microphone pre-amp. That being the case you could buy a better microphone with that money. In fact, the mic that came with Rock Band outperforms this and that's a TOY."
4,Pretty ok cheap mic,"It is made of plastic, but it looks cool. The sound is pretty good. The cord is short. For the money it is a great practice setup type mic. If you just need a mic for vocals it functions well. Resist feedback - I only used live, not for recording. A little bass heavy maybe. But you can cut the bass. Not much hiss, and very little pop. The filter screen works well. It is a good cheap mic."
2,not good at all,i can't seem to hear any thing from the mic because the volume is too low. i was gonna return this product but it would have been a waste of time because i paid just ten bucks for it. it is also really lightweight. you just get what you pay for.
4,Good Cheese,This company delivers very quickly. Good cheese but very mild taste. IMO a well aged Romano should be very sharp and bitey. This cheese is best when used to flavor sauce. It's a good value if you like a mild cheese.
5,Great cheese for the price,"I still have some of this in my freezer, but will be buying more from this seller. Even with the shipping cost, it's a great bargain. I cut it into smaller pieces, vacuum sealed them and tossed them into the freezer. Now I can take out a chunk at a time instead of hunting locally for some that is usually WAY overpriced and dried out.Very good cheese at a very good price."
4,Uneven but cheap,"This collection has some dubious choices of latter-day versions of widely available rockabilly classics (a live ""Ooby Dooby"" is particularly uninpired, and Gene Vincent's ""modern"" ""Bebop a Lula"" is not the one you came for) but plenty of rare and rocking 'billy music, and one hard-to-find bona fide classic is happily included: ""Red Hot Mama"" by Wayne Williams and the Sure Shots. Worth it for that alone. Liner notes? Not worth reading."
3,Very thorough...,"This book is very thorough in its research.It would have been great (I still recommend it) except that the author did not keep his word from the forward.He said it was not a book that gave opinions and personal interpretations (my paraphrase), but the book is guilty of much of this in regards to trying to tie the ""trinity"" to so many aspects of the tabernacle.Whenever he does this, there is no scripture given to justify the connection between the trinity and the private interpretation of scripture given. That's my only beef, but otherwise it is a good book."
4,Track listing...,Tracks...1) Mekhaye2) Spitting Song3) Skrip Klezmerl4) Balkan Espanol5) Tire L'Aiguille6) The Dead Cossack7) Madre Mia8) Mesecina9) Papirosn10) Black Cat White Cat11) Rivke
5,Will this be the last,"Plumb hasn't exploded onto the music scene, but they are talented enough to deserve recognition. They've only been around for a couple years and with them releasing this outstanding compilation already it asks the question will it all end soon for Plumb? I hope not."
2,Did I miss something?,"This has to be one of the stupidest ideas to have come to fruition lately. A greatest hits for a band that has done all of....TWO albums! First off, Plumb is a great band (see my review of CANDYCOATEDWATERDROPS) but they do not deserve a greatest hits. It's a shame because I would like to be able to say that the 'Christian' music industry is less concerned with making dinero than their secular counterparts. Unfortunately, projects like this show that to be untrue. After all, if people will dish out the money...the joke's on you music buyer. Two stars because some of the music is good, but who wants FOUR remixes? Jeez. What a joke."
3,Podia haber sido mejor,"Los autos que aparecen, son muy buenos. Pero falto calidad de edicion, quizas si hubieran incluido un presentador habria quedado mucho mejor."
5,An awsome piece of kitchen machinery,"I really do love my new Kitchen Aid mixer! In fact I love the price of my new Kitchen Aid mixer even better! $99.00 and free shipping! I just saw the exact same product at Walmart for $179.96!!!HAH!!!!! This was my early Christmas present from my parents. I have mixed ground beef for meat balls and I didn't have to get the beef all under my finger nails. My husband, who loves to cook, made up an excuse to cook a cake just to use it. WE love it. WE highly recomend it. WE will more than likely be purchasing the grinder. I hope you make the leap and purchase one also. I must say it is worth the money."
5,It's a great mixer,"it's nice to have a quality heavy duty appliance. It's easy to use, and my kids love it too."
4,Every Kitchen should have one,"I love it, the Family loves it. Wonderful product, works like a champ, would recommend to anyone that bakes."
5,I love this mixer!,"Since the time I was little, I've wanted to own a KitchenAid. Owning one has not been a disappointment or let-down. It's powerful enough to mix the chocolate chips into cookie dough without balking, which is my test for a mixer. It also scrapes the bowl really well as it mixes, so one doesn't have to stop it and scrape the sides by hand. I like it so much that I've bought two more to give to my sisters as wedding shower gifts!"
5,Amazon is Awful!,I had an awful experience with Amazon. Customer service is attrocious. Will never buy anything from Amazon again.
4,Kitchenaid,"This machine is good for family use. However, it's too costly if you want to buy other attactment for the machine."
4,Debbie the Cook,"The Kitchen Aid mixer I got worked great, but it did have several scratches on it when I took it out of the box. I decided to keep it because of the hassle of returning it for a new one. The prodcut itself works great, and it was an outstanding buy. The price was lowest I could find anywhere on the interent."
5,Excellent for dough and for Indian flat breads,Makes making whole wheat dough ('atta') a snap for India flat breads!
4,Handy piece of equipment,"I LOVE this stand mixer. I do wish the bowl were a bit wider because I find it difficult to just add things to the mix while it's going. The arm is a bit heavy and I worry it'll fall down too fast if I'm not careful. But, I do love this machine. I appreciate it's quality. And it does exactly what I bought it to do."
5,The great Mixer of Kitchen Aid,"I recommend this product with 5 stars because this brand is amazing and also, amazon.com for the incredible customer service.Amazon and Kitchen Aid the best combination for businessThanks"
5,"Wonderful gift! Great, just as expected","I bought this mixer for my girlfriend as a gift and I was extremely satisfied with what I got. She cooks and bakes often and has used this mixer many times in the short time she has had it. Extremely high quality and I expected nothing less from Kitchen Aid. No problems yet, but im not expecting any. Overall, I am extremely satisfied and would recommend this mixer to any aspiring home chef."
5,"KitchenAid K45WSSWH Classic Series 4-1/2-Quart Stand Mixer with Spatula, White","Arrived promptly,but spatula broken, returned easily, and had a new one before the other arrived back at AmazonGreat price for a quality product $$$$$!"
1,Leaks oil,"Product worked great until it started leaking oil after about 3 years. It wasn't used often or for very heavy work. Would have expected it to not have issues for much longer considering the price and low usage. Found a number of others on internet with the same complaint. Did not contact customer service, will attempt to repair myself."
5,Great Machine,"Buy it!! You will never regret the purchase. This machine, with a bit of imagination and perhaps a few attachments, can make easy work of any cooking chore. Use it, love it!!!"
2,Performance not as expected,"I bought this KitchenAid mixer because I expected a quality machine that would be a lifetime investment. However, it quit working after a year and a half of minimal use. I have sent it to the factory for repairs and I don't know the exact problem, except when I turned it on, it would make a strange noise and the blades would not turn. Since it has only a one-year warranty, I will have to pay for any repairs. This mixer was used only once or twice a month in the time we have owned it."
5,KitchenAid K45WSSWH Classic Series 4 1/2 Quart Stand Mixer,"Great product, easy to use, makes work in the kitchen a quick & pleasant experience."
4,very nice except for...,"What else can be said about the amazing Ruben Gonzales and the musicianship that hasn't been said already. But, why does Ry Cooder still keep appearing on these Nonesuch recordings? His musical contributions sound out of place and are distracting. I'm not being critical of Cooder as a musician, he is one of the greats himself; check out his chops playing on Pop's Staples ""Peace to the Neighborhood"", the ""Little Village"" recordings and the Ali Farka Toure Talkin' Timbuktu are excellent. But, with the Cuban music it just doesn't click. While you are at it, make sure to check out Frank Emilio's ""Reflejos Ancestrales""...another 80+ yr old Cuban pianist who has been overshadowed by Ruben Gonzales recent fame."
5,Seond Parts Can Be Better Than The First,"This CD is a must in every Cuban music fan collection. Not only is Ruben in top form, again, the other musicians have an opportunity to show their wonderful art too, and they are all as good as Ruben. And for those familiar with Cuban music, especially dancers, this CD brings back eleven of all time favorites. You will not be able to hold your feet in place!!"
3,"Worth having, perhaps, but not Rubén at his best","While I am pleased to have this CD in my collection, I do not enjoy it as much as ""Buena Vista Social Club Presents Rubén González"" or ""Rubén González and Friends"".There is something lacking in this album, and I cannot find a continuity in it. It provides too few opportunities for Rubén to show his stuff, meaning that few of the numbers provide a solo vehicle, and those provided are far too brief. Nor does Rubén sound to be at his absolute best.Still, Rubén González is one of the best pianists of my lifetime, and the CD is worth having for the many enjoyable numbers it contains."
5,Somethings Do Work,"I have some some books on men in prison and I've found on that has a plan for everyone that works no matter which Church theybelong to as long as it's based on the Bible.I have knowen some men who have been in prison and they say that programs offered in prison for the most part fail to helpfolks, as plan for the time when they leave from they've been incarcerated.When anyone gets right with themsevles there's a differant outlook as you can see being playede out in the book as they are offered a chance for change in their lives.I wish more institutions offered these programs."
3,Cain's Redemption....HMMMMM,"I gave this book a rating of three for one simple reason, any book that can make this Warden look like a good guy must have an amazing author! I worked with this Warden for several years and I, like many others from his neck of the woods, know him as a money hungry, evil hearted, manipulating individual who will hurt anyone and do anything to get what he wants! So yes, I gave it a fair rating - it is fair FICTION! The true story of this man would really be a page turner."
3,"Aimed at research beginners, not seasoned researchers","This book is useful in two different aspects: It offers a comprehensive overview of the field of Conversation Analysis, and the book is well divided into different aspects of that field. Three downfalls of this book include pratical applications and solutions to help start or direct a conversation analysis research project. Secondly, the absence of a conversation analysis methology detracts from the usefullness. And finally the growing field of Computer-Mediated Communication is given only brief mention. The third downfall reason is why I gave this book 3 out of five stars... it overlooks an important and growing aspect of conversation analysis"
2,frustration,This bit of technology is so frustrating to operate.. The instruction manual was of little or no help...and finally after hours of trial and error and the help of a neighbor can almost use the eaudiobook portion. We have to load the book into the music section..have never discovered how to bookmark...but can finally pause and later return to the book.
4,great product and very good service,"this product works very wellhas a FM radio so, you can swicht from your music libraryto fm any time, also the have very good customer supportat case you have any issue."
4,Good Ipod alternative..,"My nine-year-old daughter purchased this mp3 player with all of her saved birthday money because she wanted an ""ipod"" like her friends but did not have the money for the video Ipod she wanted. We actually like this much better. I think it's a bit sturdier and easier for her to hold on to. We're still working through how to use it (I'm not exactly the most tech savy parent!) but it has been pretty easy to use and figure out. And when my sister gets home from college this weekend I'm sure she'll show us the 50 other things we can do with it that I had no idea about!"
5,Great Product,"This mp3 player is so ease to use ,no problems at all.also,it was shipped to me really fast and it was just as described. Thanks"
1,screen does not work,it is hard to rate this product. considering the lcd screen does not work. this is the condition of the unit right out of the box. will update review when finished with customer service.
3,Not Bad,"I like this product however, I was not aware that my computer didn't have a ""high speed"" USB so I had to spend $70 to get it upgaded just to be able to use the product. I know it's not the company's fault that my computer is older, but I wish I would have known. Live & learn I guess. If I didn't run into that problem I would have rated the product higher."
3,Sansa Rhapsody,"So I've had this for a couple years now. It's still working great. I still haven't used the expansion slot. I do have it full of music. I love this Mp3 player. It's easy to use (my littlest ones can operate it). I did buy different ear buds for it. I have small ears, and there was no way I was going to be able to use the ones it came with. I have nothing bad to say about this one. My husband still uses his on a daily basis also."
3,Value for Money!,"This is no top of the line mp3 player but scores for low cost.The controls are pretty easy and intuitive. The UI design is strictly OK and so is the flimsy cover which ships with it.It takes a major hit in sound quality. Its got just two options Normal and High, and even on the High setting, the sound is not great! The FM quality is also kinda OK. There are few fixed equaliser options. Another area of worry is the Charging. It can only be charged through a USB port, it ships with a cable to connect to your machine. This can get irritating especially if you're on a journey and you're not carrying your laptop around. The battery life is pretty sturdy. I ususally use Windows Media player for syncing my music to it. Its pretty easy and simple. The earplugs shipped with it are a nice fit.I guess at its cost, its a good bet!"
3,good but it breaks,"The item is really good and cheap, a lot better then ipod and after a short time you find out how to load music. The features are really god to but the display is to small for hole movies (I had a headach after one). The only problem is the thing breaks so fast. I had it 2 weeks and it froze, the display became a quater white. I had a lot of good music on there which I can't get back so it is really bad for me. I had to send it in and just good a new one. I try it one more time then I give up.So if you have some time and your music at homeit is better than ipod. if you have not a lot of time and you are not pacient search for somethin else or buy an ipod. I am still sticking with it because I see the advantages but it is a lot of work."
3,Disapointed,"I was really looking forward to getting this MP3 player. However I was disapointed from day one. IT WOULDN'T TURN ON!! And yes I did have the lock switched to on. The only way it would turn on was if it was plugged in to the computer. I sent it back. However, when it was on, it worked great and was alot of fun. I may buy another one someday and give it another try."
4,Wall Charger?,I'm interested in this item and upon research i saw that some people couldn'tfind a wall charger. If you go to Wal-Mart website you can find a wall charger for any MP3 player with a USB cable.Otherwise I think this is a great product
2,Not all necessary conditions to use this are included.,"First of all not all the conditions necessary to use this device are revealed anywhere. When I called the manufacturer, they told me it was a ""legacy"" device and they didn't do phone support for it. Since the device is advertised as a new product, calling it a legacy devide for service purposes is at best disingenuous and at worst a common practice of deception so pervasive in the marketplace in today's world. I sent it back and will never buy another device of any kind from this Manufacturer under any circumstances."
1,Wasn't as listed...,"This was priced to get my attention, but it turned out to be not new, but used, scratched, with a scratched installation disk. Couldn't install the software to use this product, couldn't get music on player without software. Thankfully, Amazon came through with a refund of the purchase price and the shipping, so I wasn't out anything except for the frustration of having to return it and begin the search again."
3,"it's refurbished, not new","My own 2-year-old Sansa was accidentally broken, and since I really liked the way it worked, I wanted another. Paying full-price seemed a bit high at this point, so I decided to go with a refurbished for the savings. The one I got works well, just not as good as a new one (or as good as the one I had had). There's a small problem with the volume control changing on its own, which is a continual irritant, but not life-threatening."
4,Very good competition for the IPod Nano,"Over all ease of operation was good. The quality of the pictures on the screen was great. Transfering music, pictures, and recording is very easy. The expansion slot allows you to have endless memory as long as you have SD disks to put it on, making this item a good rival for the IPod Nano. The only down side I see is that to watch videos you have to convert them first. I would suggest this to anyone who wants a MP3 player but doesn't want to pay the prices they want for the IPods and Zunes."
1,Not very user friendly,"I wanted an MP3 player that was easy to use as I am lacking some of the sophicated skills required for some of the newer electronic gadgets. This Sandisk MP3 player did not want to help me connect and navigate my Vista system. I called the company and they were useless and the suggestions offered did not answer my questions. A subsequent e-mail only sent me to a discussion group that didn't even address my concern about compatability between the MP3 player and Vista. Nowhere in the instructions were there any references to Vista. I ended up sending the player to my grandson for Christmas and with his Windows XP he was ableto use it. I can't be the only user out there with a Vista system and this player. Hopefully the company will address this problem and be able to offer valid responses and or ""fixes"" to the questions of their customer's that recieved this product for Christmas."
2,Get an Ipod instead...,"If your reading this, and thinking about buying this product, don`t unless you have state of the art music systems. Rhapsody and itunes both dont work for mine. And its very complicated to get a video on to it.Great customer service though. =)"
3,"Lots of memory, but not as good as the older model SanDisk SDMX1-1024","I was very happy with my SanDisk SDMX1-1024 (1 GB Silver) and hence I bought this new model from Sandisk. I like the 4GB memory and Lithium battery in this player, but there are several aspects that are not so good compared to the older model.Pros:1. No need to buy batteries or recharge AAA batteries2. 4GB memory size is very useful3. Volume control is easier as you can rotate it clock/anticlock wise while holding the player at any angle.4. The video play capability is nice (I tried to watch a video while working out), although it is not convenient to watch on such a small screen.Cons:1. Buttons are hard and not so convenient (SDMX1 had the best controls I have ever seen in audio players).2. The charger/sync cable is propriatory3. Cannot select a song based on the folder organization (you could do this in SDMX)"
2,Well known design flaw causes headphone jack to fail,"Headphone jack poorly designed so it breaks w/normal use on many players. There are instructions on-line on how to disassemble the thing but without extensive skills;it's almost impossible to fix.When it's good, it's very good. When it's bad, it's VERY bad. Sad because it's a nice player at a good price so when it dies...you cry a little."
2,"good customer service, but poor quality product","When I said ""poor"", I kinda hesitate if it is a too much of a strong word for sansa. I must say that it's not easy to use, but it didn't break on me. what is broken is the ear phone. I only got it for 6 month, and the earphone is broken. I had my IPOD for 3 years, and it's still good. when I emailed to the customer service about this. they said the earphone is accessory and not included in the warranty. That is just great. I am not going to buy any more of sandisk prodcut."
4,"very good, but one flaw","These were bought ""refurb"", so I wasn't expecting too much; however, they work just fine. My first time w/Sansas and for the most part I'm satisfied. They are super easy to navigate, great video, radio and of course music. Very good battery Life. My only complaint is that they both freeze from time to time. I bought both as gifts and getting them replaced is not an option seeing how I took (and left) them overseas, but if they last for some time, it'll be worth the price paid. I'd be open to buying more Sansa products."
3,kids love it,my two boys received one for christmas this year and they have no complaints!! cant ask for more than that. they use them all the time
1,Ticking Time Bomb,"I purchased a factory refurb version of this unit through a different online retailer. After one week the internal soldering of the headphone jack broke, so that only the left audio channel would play. I immediately returned the unit to the dealer and received a replacement. I have now had the same thing happen to my replacement unit 6 months later. I should make it clear that both players were carefully handled and used very lightly.I opened a support ticket with Sandisk. The will not stand by their product. They state that they do not support factory refurb units. This means that if it fails on day one you are out of luck if the retailer won't help you out. Since this is beyond the 30 days of original purchase I am out of luck.Sandisk does not stand behind their Sansa players. Run away from this brand! Trust me. The build quality and quality control simply aren't there. There are much better options out there."
3,Think before you buy,"I bought the Sansa e260 over a year ago and have had satisfactory performance from it. The first thing that I noticed is that I couldn't just drag and drop files. I had to load Rhapsody to use it for music. I couldn't listen to anything I didn't just rip to it, also Rhapsody costs to use for more than an interface. It is not easy to use nor is it very user friendly. I finally figured out how to get around the Rhapsody problem, but it is still a pain to use. Don't under any circumstances ever disconnect from your computer with out shutting the e260 down after doing so. It locks the e260 up and you will have to remove the battery to shut it down. Also even though it looks like and IPOD connect don't even try it. I had to send mine back to get fixed after doing so. Somehow it over heated the unit. I am happy with size and interface of the unit, but if you like to drag and drop files or just want something with a little less problems, look around for something elcse."
1,I hate the design,"I bought this for hiking/the gym/running. I hated this thing from the first use - the controls use a spinning wheel to navigate the menu, then push the wheel to click the menu option. It's not instinctive or simple. The wheel often over-shoots, and I have to press it harder over time to get it to work. Also, the volume isn't good on the loud side. I max out the player volume and the stereo I feed it through to have it be loud enough to work out (I work out at home).There are better models out there, with better user interface."
4,Sandisk mp3 player and radio,This unit works as advertised! I am enjoying my music on the move. My only complaint with this purchase is that I did NOT get any print document on how to access and use the various functions of it. After getting the unit to play it is a great device. I am preparing to use the SanDisk mini card to expand the amount of music that I have available for use.....
4,Would purchase again,"First mp3 product I have owned. I would purchase this product again. The only drawback was that the instruction manual did not come with this product, but it was easy enough to figure out how it operated. I also had a relative who helped with the operation."
4,Excellent. Very Satisfied,The Sansa is a great mp3 player. I've got over a thousand songs and 1 GB still left. I just plugged it into my computer and it Windows Media Player helped my sync my music to it like I was burning a CD. I can't figure out how to delete music from the player though. That's really frustrating. Just be careful what you put on it because you may not be able to get it off.
4,meets expectation,"Bought the Sansa for a Granddaughter who had a Sansa with less capacity. Both came from Amazon and both have been an exceptional value for the dollar spent. The e260 did go blank or freeze twice shortly after being loaded with music, but after removal and reinserting the battery it has performed quite well.Thanks Amazon"
4,Great MP3 player.,The sansa is truly a great mp3/movie/photo player/viewer. The picture is quite nice for it's size and the menus work really well (just make sure you keep your ID3v2 tags updated). The sound is very nice and my wife can actually use it. Because you can plug it in as a flash drive it works really well with my linux box. Now for the bad news which is why I rated it a four.Sandisk decided that you could only use it's proprietary software for pictures and movies which is not compatible at all with linux hence I run into some trouble there. I don't mind so much that the usb port is the only way to charge it but I guess it would be nice to be able to plug it into my car. Oh well.Enjoy!
4,Sansa Media Player review,"1) Its small,sleek and does what is expected - plays mp3 music2) The only limitation is the size of the screen is too-too small to view images or videos.3) I like the FM radio feature and the ability to capture and save radio snippets"
5,I really like it.,"I really like it.It's an inexpensive alternative to the ipod. And it is so simple to use in conjunction with Windows Media Player 11. You simply connect the device to your computer (which is then reconized by your media player), you drag and drop the files of your choice, you click sync, and voilà you are ready for the road."
2,5 Stars for the short time it lasted,"Bought this about 11 months ago. Took it on a week long trip for tunes then put it in a drawer for several months. Started using it just 2 months ago mostly for the voice recorder feature but also to listen to tunes. Today it puked. I figure I used it for less than 3 months total. Yes, daily use, but always gentle with it, never dropped, etc.Loved it while it worked. Great sound quality, easy enough to add and delete songs, etc. But hey - for this kind of money the thing should work a LOT longer than a couple of months!"
1,Designed to Fail; I should have known!,"It worked OK for about two weeks, then the music I had loaded onto it started skipping and popping. Songs even began to disappear! I tried to reload music and noticed mysterious unremovable files and folders in the player. Finally the firmware that runs the player crapped out. When I tried to find the firmware on Sansa's website it had been discontinued or made unavailable. So this all was an $85 education in hard knocks. Never again will I buy anything made by Sansa."
4,e260R Review,"/ e260R Rhapsody / Excellent product and this is my 2nd e260. I find this unit easy to use and with sufficient mp3 storage capacity for my purpose. Excellent audio output and portability are bonus features. I did not get a wall type charger with the shipment, and it should be provided with the unit in future orders."
5,Great alternative to the iPod,"Got this as a gift for my mother, who was hooked on her Sony CD Walkman and comprehensive CD collection for years. She loves carrying around such a small, versatile device, without a bulky CD wallet or extra batteries. Consumers are way too brainwashed by Apple's shiny sublime commercialism. This offers a mechanical scroll wheel similar the ipod, and there are several Altec Lansing speakers on the market to enjoy your music throughout the room.Here is what this device offers that the iPod does not:-Replaceable Lion battery (battery kit includes screws and driver)-Micro SD card slot for memory expansion-FM Radio-Built in microphone for recording voice-scratch resistant back (not that shiny chrome Apple uses)-Drag and drop music from My computer-average 3/5 the price of a comparable iPod-Freedom of drag and drop so, idiot proof"
2,Returned it,"I bought one of these for myself and one for my boyfriend but returned them both a few days later. It was ""ok"" but had technical issues. Navigating through the menus wasn't very intuitive and as far as looks go, it was pretty boring. There were too many problems with the computer not recognizing the hardware, the media converter not working, MTP mode not working, and tech support not being able to help. After a few days of trying to solve the problem and not finding a solution, I decided it wasn't worth the trouble. I bought a Samsung S3 instead and couldn't be happier. It was the same price, looks much nicer, is easier and more fun to use, and it works without any technical problems."
4,I love It!,This is actually a really simple product to use and it works just as great or better than alot of the more expensive ones. It is easy for anyone of any age to use. I would definitely recommend this.
4,Great Mp3 Player,"Everything that I read about this product has been correct. Great price, great look. The application wheel for the product is fairly cheap feeling but honestly how often do you use something like that to worry about? I read that the sound quality wasn't the best. It sounds just fine to me.The only pet peeves I have about the product is Sandisc's website is really lacking. I went to their FAQs section hoping to find indepth directions on creating or uploading my playlists and the directions that were there were incorrect. I wanted to be able to create a playlist in Windows Media player, sync up to my Sansa and upload the playlist, album and songs. It doesn't quite work that way. The website stated in order to 'create' a playlist you have to either select the song you want to add to the 'Go list' within the player or within your device folder in Windows.All in all a great product!"
5,Sansa e260,Great product at a great price. Got for my son at Christmas after reviewing many other MP3 players and this is the most bang for the buck. Got a micro-SD card to put in and that works flawlessly as well. Great graphics on the screen. Highly recommend.
5,GREAT mp3 player,"There's no need for me to type a lot about it because so many others have stated the finer points of this player. I got it for $130 from Amazon, and got a second for my g/f for Christmas. It holds plenty of music for me... I don't need to carry my entire library in my pocket, but with the expansion slot I could definitely increase the space if I wanted to. And with the ease of transferring the data to it (with WMP11 or Winamp) I can easily remix the catalog on it to suite my taste.You'll definitely want to get a decent pair of earphones (Shure or the like) because it comes with the standard crappy uncomfortable plastic pellets that are supposed to hang just inside your ears but never stay in. I'm not dinging the Sansa for this because I never expected it to have good earphones and I already have a set of Shure E3s. A silicone skin for it is also a good way to protect its pretty glossy black exterior."
4,Good product,Video quality is good. The video conversion is fast. Very fast and can convert many file formats. I have not tried it yet with a quality earphone so sound is so-so. I still have difficulty organizing the songs. Battery lasts long even when playing videos
4,MP3 just as advertised,I was very pleased with this MP3 player - as was my 17 yr old son.. I have heard nothing but good things about its performance
5,Sandisk Sansa e260 mp3 player,"I would encourage anyone to buy the Sandisk Sansa e260. This is my third purchase. Two were purchased last year for my sister and myself and get alot of use! I got one this year for my husband. It is sturdy, great quality, we have had no problems with the Sandisk Sansa e260. I rate it very high!"
4,great player,"This is an awesome mp3. It is the first I've own and seems to be of great quality. I guess I can't compare it to another one. Anyway, the screen is great, transfer of songs works easily and it seems like it will withstand quite a bit of usage. I really have no complaints. I like the way it sorts the songs, pictures and videos."
5,Great stuff in Afghanistan.,"It's not always easy getting stuff while being deployed in the Army. I have had to wait for items or have been told ""Sorry we don't ship to APO/FPO addresses"". It's not always easy serving the country and it's good to find people who are willing to do that extra little bit to make our time over seas a little easier. Thanks Amazon. My MP3 player works great. I got it in a timely manner and haven't had any problems."
1,Poor Construction. Short Life.,This producted is poorly constructed. The slightest pressure on the earphone plug will cause the solder to break loose from the circuit board causing music to only play through one ear. Why would any company in its right mind rely soley on solder to hold an earphone plug in place (and a small amount of solder at that). Lesson learned. What a waste of my money.
4,Sansa e260 4GB MP3 player -- refurb,"I bought this player for my teenage daughter, and it seems so good that I may get one for myself. I ordered an open box version sold through Amazon's warehouse outlet. The unit came in a box that looked somewhat worn, and there was no CD with included software. The San Disk website does not offer the San Disk media converter software for download. I tried downloading it from some site that I found on the web, but the software never recognized the player when plugged into the USB port. However you don't need the software to load music or photos onto the player. I don't know if you need it for videos. Anyway the player works great and buying a refurb saved quite a bit of money."
5,Better than ipod,"This is the best mp3 player. It is inexpensive, small, but has a lot of space for music, plus a slot for more memory, and all 4 of my teenages have one. We can download any music we want, and the battery lasts long. They like charging it on the computer, but I purchased the wall charger and the car charger for them, just to be safe. It has a big screen and it is well worth the money. Which is much cheaper than the other models we looked at. I am very happy with our purchase, and all 4 of them were purchased at Amazon.com"
5,Great MP3 Player,Awesome device. My wife and I take these kayaking in Florida. Great for personal music collection and the FM radio is great for listening to weather when necessary.
5,Better than IPOD,"This product is cheaper and better than ipod, you can easily drag your music to the Sansa, it can read more types of archives than the ipod and you can view videos. I recomend this product."
1,"TERRIBLE product, and bad service","I bought this MP3 player for my wife a year ago. Within the first month she was having problems with it freezing. The customer service person said to take the battery out and restart it(which required a glasses repair kit for a screwdriver that small). This became a monthly routine until recently when it would stop playing out of one headphone (tried multiple headphones) and it never worked. Since the 1 year warranty is up Sandisk has offered NO help. I would NOT recomend this product the system freezes, sound quality is Average (when working), and it is a pain to use the multiple software programs to load the different files onto it (MP3, .jpg, mass files, etc.)."
2,Bought two of these & returned them both,"This one had all of the features I wanted so I bought two of these, one for myself and the other as a gift. After using one for two days and experiencing the ""freezing"" problems experienced by over 100 of the other reviewers, I decided to send back both for a full refund. This was the first time I ever had to return an item to Amazon for any reason and even though one package was opened they still gave me a full refund for both due to the noted defect. Thank goodness for their great return policy. I tried to give this product a chance since so many mp3 players seem to have firmware issues but I didn't want to chance the problem staying or getting worse after the 30 day return timeframe. I'm glad I made that decision and am going to try the Samsung K3 or K5 instead, since those models seems to be more stable."
1,Had to Send it Back,"This mp3 player never worked properly. After searching the web for solutions, downloading ""updates"", and changing various settings, I gave up and returned it to Amazon. They refunded my money promptly. I replaced it with the iRiver Gen 2. It works great and has much better features as well."
4,Better for the price.,"This item is better for the price that the comparible ipod. For me the slightly larger physical size is an advantage. plus some accessories that are available for this player aren't available with ipods or zunes. I like the fact that you can upgrade the player online and it has an easily replaceable battery. The cost of the battery is very reasonable. The playing time on the battery is phenomenal- mine has been averaging about 22 to 24 hours on a single charge. We have 5 e series players in our household now. We all agree that for the money, it is the best player on the market. There are lots of places to improve- a better EQ, louder standard sound, and for the size- a speaker phone, a couple more menus, just to name a few. But overall we're very, very satisfied with our purchases. Oh yeah, I almost forgot the sd expansion slot so you can improve the size of storage capacity. All software needed is provided too."
1,"If you call tech support, plan for half a day.","Bought two as Xmas presents. Both devices have had the major issues with batteries and memory. (One player had issues when taken out of box, tech support sent new battery, but to this day, still has same problem only now every other month.) Have spent several hours on phone with technical support. At least twenty minute wait each time."
2,don't bother,"The sound quality was good and the way this mp3 player operated when music was loaded into it was just fine, but trying to download the music into this device was a disaster! My advice would be pay a little more and go for the Ipod."
1,Review of Sansa e260,Sorry I can't be any help with this item. I never got Windows XP to recognize the device even after spending several hours with my friend in India. I had to return it since I couldn't load any music on it. I like the size and capacity of it but couldn't use it
2,Works...kind of,"Sadly, I had to send this back.The pros: It looks and sounds great.The cons: No real playlist support, no bookmarking, does not intergrate well (as claimed) with online services, glitchy firmware.Somewhere down the line maybe they will improve the firmware, but why pay for an item that works part of the time?"
1,Dis Illusioned,"The one I bought was brand new. It's been on charge for 12 hours now. It won't turn on, the battery is completely dead and won't take a charge. I think I am going to stick to my 8-track."
1,Sansa-Sandisk,"It's not worth a D_ _ _!!! I can't get enough volume out of it to even hear it at the gym... guess I'll need to be sending it back unless someone can tell me why it has no volume,--(and that's using it on HIGH volume)..."
3,I have has some problems with it....,I like it ok. I have had some problems with it. Freezes up alot and i have some problems downloading songs onto it.
2,Terrible,I bought this player 2 months ago at walmart and I returned it quickly. Everytime I would play a video the screen would freeze. I bought me a Zune instead. I havent had any complaints about my Zune.
4,Soo much better than the Ipod Nano!,"I got this 4GB Sansa two days ago and I'm very pleased with it. I only paid 129.00 here at Amazon, compared to 169.00 at Walmart. Anyway, I loaded over 2 hours worth of video (2 episodes of Family Guy and 2 episodes of Friends),and 300+ songs, and I still have 980Mb left! It also has a Micro Disk slot so you can keep adding more files. I was ready to shell out 250 bucks for the Ipod Video, I'm glad I bought this Sansa. The only issue I have is with the buttons, it's kinda hard to press the buttons around the spin wheel, other than that, I'm quite satisfied. I guess it just takes a little getting used to."
2,Sandisk has the right idea but misses on some important details,"This is an okay device in a crowded product market, but there are a few details that should be improved upon before I would buy another. Perhaps my irks are addressable via firmware, but until then.....here's my take:Pros:Good battery lifeExpandable with mircoSD slotPocket-friendly form factorCons:Slooow boot time in MSC modeBug in custom EQ setting causes intermittent signal loss in one or both channelsInterface navigation is not immediately intuitive to a former ipod or creative userAudio signal is low from headphone jack - too low for practical use on line inputs to my home and car audio systems. Ipod and Creative devices didn't require amplification on the same inputs.Proprietary software required to transfer video and photos.Proprietary cable required for data transfer."
1,Really wanted to like this,"I bought this because I didn't want to get sucked into the world of ipod. Within the first 2 weeks of receiving this it started breaking down. It would freeze up, screen would turn black, wheel would stay lit until the thing lost power. Then I would have to charge back up to get it working again. It got to the point that it was no longer working. Sandisk sent me another one. It was good until the same thing started happening again. what happens now is the thing freezes up after 5 minutes and I again have to wait until it loses power to charge it again. Sandisk sent me another one, only to have the Sansa break down the same way again.Since october 2006 i have had 3 sansa players of which both have failed. I have now turned to ipod and feel that the product is so much superior. The only good thing I have to say about the Sansa is that their customer service is great."
1,Nothing but trouble from these,Bought 3 of these Sansa players last year for the family. Since then have had nothing but trouble with them. The problem lies in the software package that consistently fails and requires reformatting. Must have reformatted each one about 5-7 times now - each time requiring that all the songs be reloaded. The most recent problem resulted in one of the players (250R) not being able to reformat so now it is useless. Do not buy this product - spend a little more money and get something that actually works consistently.
5,"Excellent product, excellent price!","This was an absolute bargain! I bought it for my teen who is very picky when it comes to electronics. She loves it more than the I-pods her friends have. You can buy music from lots of websites for this MP3 player, unlike the I-pod. The video quality is impressive. There's lots of memory on it and she has several FULL LENGTH movies as well as tons of songs downloaded already. Get a case for it, if possible, to protect it from clumsy kids. Everyone will want to try it out! You'll have to beg them to give it back!!!"
1,Sansa e260 no worth the money,"I purchase the e260 after the head phone jack broke they told me that the physical damage was not covered. I was so surprised because it did not drop or any thing, It just dried our and cracked"
2,Are you up for a fight?,"Can't get it to sink video. Spent hours downloadig this or that. I downloaded the converter software from sandisk's websight. But I still can't get it to do anything. I have spent 4 hours trying to make it work. Don't wast your time buy an iPod, it's only $50 bucks more but it will save hours and hours.... And hours. How much is a headach really worth?"
2,"Player plagued with software kinks, hardware lasts for less than 1 year","I used this player for my workouts at the gym. I've gone through 3 of them already since the hardware is so unreliable. I've had a variety of issues, from the scroll circle moving up when I move it down, to buttons getting so sensitive that they are pressed inadvertently in my pocket, to the headphone jack going faulty and not allowing me to listen on any set of headphones.The software has alot of kinks, specifically this player crashed quite often. I used rockbox to get around the software kinks, and this makes it alot easier to use.I don't recommend it, and I wish there was some better alternative that is more reliable."
4,SanDisk e260,"I found the player to be easy to use and very functional. It met all my needs except one. This player will not play audio books from Audio dot com. The Company I got it from, J and R, was wonderful bending over backwards to assist me in an exchange for a player that better met my needs. There was nothing wrong with the SanDisk just the problem with audio books."
4,Good looking MP3,This is a stylish looking unit. The only issue I have with the product is it should be easier to change the volume.
2,I really wanted to like this player...,"4GB capacity for the price was tough to beat, and at first I really liked this MP3 player. Lots of features, lots of storage, good sound quality, easy menu access through the scroll wheel. Having to convert photos and video through the proprietary software was a drag, and apparently there is a firmware bug that caused the player to crash repeatedly and with increasing frequency, to the point where it would crash while it was rebooting. Fortunately, Sansa has a firmware patch on their website, so the problem is easily remedied. JUST DON'T DROP IT. I had it in a rubber case at the gym and accidentally dropped it from 4 feet onto a rubber floor, and now the player won't cut on no matter what I do. Now I'm looking to replace it with a Zune."
4,"Beautiful sound, doc link for non-intuitives","I have never had an MP3 player before, so I am totally inexperienced. I ordered this one from Amazon and spent a few hours getting acquainted. The sound quality is wonderful! I set it up to play via FM on my car radio and I am thoroughly impressed! What a new buyer needs to know is that the documentation is pathetic. The website is not much help either. However, the UP side is that the tech support is great. I made two calls and did not have to wait to reach a person on either of them. The tech guy led me to the PDF support and this is the link:[...]I am pleased with the purchase. The player is great!"
5,"Great Value, Great Product","I recently purchased the Sansa e260 from Amazon. The price was, and still is, a bargain compared to the other comparable players on the market. The player has performed flawlessly. I used MS Media Player to rip CDs and load them on the e260, I have also ""dragged and dropped"" existing MP3 music files to the player. Creating playlists and syncing to the player works well, but be sure to follow the directions in the user guide. The whole process could not be simpler. I have not tried to download any files from Rhapsody...this might be more difficult.Operation of the player is simple and intuitive. Also, the battery life is really great - took it on a twelve hour flight and did not have to worry about the battery dying during the trip.Fit and finish of the unit is good. Coupled with the ease of operation and great pricing on Amazon, it is really a great buy!"
4,Convenient mp3 player,"I would recommend this mp3 player to those who like to listen to music while jogging or exercising. It's small, very light, and comes with a handy lanyard (for some reason I hate the armband straps). Since the machine doesn't use a hard drive, it doesn't skip like hard drive players do when shaken around.The downside to using a memory card of course is access speed - it takes a bit of time after downloading new music for it to hash through all the new files, and accessing humongous playlists can take some time (a list with around 100 songs takes 5 - 10 seconds to load). Usually I just open up a large playlist and let the player shuffle through the songs. Choosing a song through a large playlist is a pain, since the machine is slow when scrolling.For a ""serious"" mp3 player I would rather recommend something like the iRiver, but if you're just using it for exercise etc. this one's great. It's a great replacement for the iPod Shuffle in my opinion."
4,Nice Mp3 & Video player,It is a nice Mp3 and video player. It is easy to use and is very portable. It a has good video resolution. I am satisfied with this purchase.
3,Music System,"Just as advertised-quick shipping.The functionality leaves some things to be desired, especially versus the iPod, but is just as good in my opinion, especially for the savings which were about 40% over similar Apple products. You get what you pay for!!"
4,Beautiful & practical. Great sound fair images.,"Yes, beautiful & practical. I used to record lectures from myself or from another people. Great sound when you listen your music with earphone or home stereo. Reproduction of photos is good but watching videos is dissapointing. May we get some software like ""Documents to go"" ir order to check Windows soft's?"
5,my Sansa speaks Korean now,"Love this Sansa, Tech support was very helpful with a firmware updade to support the Korean language to make it more comfortable for my wife to use. Pictures look great on the unit but are fussy to get on and in the proper orientation. The unit is full but with the expansion slot you can carry lots of extra media with you. very nice sound, FM works great, happy with the choice to go with the sansa e260."
2,sansa's quality is shaky at best,"After about six months it just up and stoped working. Prior to that the audio would go in and out, left ear bud only then right. Other than the fact it never really worked right it's great. I have friends with one and they have never had any problems, but I got a lemon. Their quality assurance is pretty sloppy."
4,Go bigger.,"Just get the 8gb version. Or whatever the biggest one is at the time your reading this.I've put video on it w/o any problem. It does take a long time to cook as all video is in .MOV (Quicktime) format.The entire E200 family is so far better than all of the C100/C200 players it's amazing. Don't even bother looking at the C series, especially if you think you might get the Sansa Base Station or about any other Dock for them. The docks work best with the E series.The MicroSD slot is nice but it's probably cheaper to max out the built in memory now by getting the 8GB unit, which has all the same features."
2,didn't deliver,"I was really looking forward to an MP3 player that didn't use proprietary hardware. The Sansa e260 promised that it would show up as a disk drive or enable synching to MediaPlayer. The instructions were sparse and I tried both methods. This ended up in the device being so scrambled that there was no way to gain control. It showed up as both full and empty depending on what I was trying to do (get back in control!) I couldn't delete and I couldn't add and it hung on most operations. Contacted support and they were quick to help. We tried upgrading firmware, downgrading firmware, and other esoteric tricks requiring some interesing mulptiple buttons at startup. Nothing worked and Sandisk offered to send another along. If it only took me one day to confuse it, I declined their offer and will purchase the product I was trying to avoid."
4,Compact,Great product. The only complaint I have is that you cannot put photo's on the micro sd card. The player works great and the battery last for a long time.RCS
1,Refurbished Not the way to go...,"We decided to try and save some money by buying refurbished MP3 players for the kids. Both died within four days of having gotten them. No real reason found for the failures, they just flat stopped working. Not recommended to anyone that they buy refurbished stuff. Save up the money and buy a good quality new one. You truly get what you pay for."
1,Nothing but problems,"I have owned the Sansa e260 for about a year now and after 6 months it became extremely problematic. The main issues are with playlists and uploading new songs. Created playlists often disappear, certain songs will play and then never play again, random play often puts you on a loop of hearing the same songs over and over again and syncing up to my computer to re-format and erase old songs so I can add new songs often crashes the whole player. Sansa website is not customer friendly and their downloads often do not download. ( you have to go to their website when your player crashes to re-boot it.) If I could go back in time, I would not buy this mp3 player, even though the price is attractive and the looks are cool."
4,The kid liked so I guess that's good,Good value for the price. A little annoyed with the restart everytime I unplug it from my system and the transfer program can use a little work. But real nice and easy to use.
4,Simple with great functionality,I ordered this product because of the FM recorder functionality. This turned out to be very good. The output is great and does not require any audio editing to make the quality clearer. The product is also simple to use.Great reccomendation for school use.
3,Windman,This MP3 is a study in both good and not so good. First the good: a ton of music can be stored and organized and works well with the Rhapsody subscription system: you are your own radio station producer!Way cool!Now the not so good: I've found this MP3 to be extremely balky when navigating between playlists and using the random/repeat options: you literally have to shut off the player and restart it if you switch from one playlist to another (UGH!) otherwise you will hear the same song over and over again: this can be frustrating when on the go especially when driving and using an FM Transmitter or jogging.But balance that annonyance with a lot of music space and a nice two hour battery and for the money you have a good value for your money.
5,Great MP3 Players!,"Bought these as gifts for my kids and they absolutely love them! One of the players did lock up once and we couldn't get it to play, but after rebooting, it started back up just fine."
3,Yuck. Flimsy at best.,"I never liked it. It froze, was bulky and large, and it was very difficult to put songs on it. At least it has an expansion slot for memory cards. Stick with Ipods for now."
4,Pretty good music player,"It's a pretty nice MP3 player. The only problem I've had is that if you are manually creating .m3u playlists, they sometimes don't work correctly unless all the files are in the same folder. I haven't tried creating playlists with Windows Media Player. The v2 version that I received accepts microSDHC cards, which gets rid of the 2GB limit."
5,Great quality for the price.,"I bought one of these just last week, it works great and is still working perfectly.It allows me to watch music video's, and listen to my favorite songs.I don't have any regrets."
5,Ipod Terminator,"Strengths: Affordable, Plays Video, Flash-based storageWeaknesses: Low(er) Capacity (compared to hard drive players), case shows marks/fingerprints easily, cheap headphones includedExcellent player for the price - like a smaller version of a Video Ipod, but better in some ways! It is flash based - so no moving parts to break or wear out. The battery is user replaceable so you're not up a creek when it does go out in a year or two.The software it comes with is just basic, but simple and easy to use - just choose some files (including DVD .VOB files), and it converts them and puts them on the player for you - pretty quickly, too. (Much faster than 600mb per hour that another reviewer said, though I haven't clocked it.)There's good community support, and talk of their being RockBox support coming up for this player, which will make it even better! It's arguably the best thing out there for the price!Highly recommended - you can't go wrong with this one."
4,So far I am much impressed,First off I got this for my daughter(13) who really wanted a Nano. I being one of the geeky parents knew the Sansa was a much better deal with the fm radio and the video. I got 4 gb for the price of a 2 gb Nano as well. I love the ability to drag and drop music onto the Sansa. I'm not a big fan of syncing since I have way too much music on my pc to sync. The video conversion worked great as well with the included software. The picture is small(I prefer my psp for movies and videos) but looks very sharp. Let us not forget the ability to change the battery yourself. A big factor in my book. I'm sure she will pwn all the nano kids. Be a leader not a follower. Go with the better product not the hype and trendy.
1,delicate screen,"decent product as far as features go but I bought 2 of them, 1 for me 1 for my son. On Both players the screen broke inside . Support is frustrating at best. Bottom line is I'm stuck with 2 useless and expensive mp3 players."
4,alternate charging method,I own this particular model and have found an alternate method for charging the unit other then connecting to the PC with the supplied USB cable. Griffin makes a compatible product which incorporates the USB cable that came with the unit; the AC adaptor/charger also comes with a USB cable that fits the Sansa e260. I hope you enjoy yours as much as I enjoy mine. Merry Christmas all!
4,"DOA, but easily fixed","Bought the e260 to replace an aging iPod shuffle. It arrived yesterday and appeared to be DOA. Pressing the menu key simply caused the blue switch to light up and stay lit, no screen display, no sound, and the menu key wouldn't turn off the blue light.I googled around a bit looking for hints/tips on fixing the problem and saw a suggestion to remove the battery to completely reset the device. Being daring, I unscrewed the four tiny phillips head screws on the back of the unit, removed the battery for around 30 seconds, put it all back together, and voila. The e260 came alive and seems to be functioning normally.Hope the above helps some other poor soul suffering from what seems to be a DOA unit.As for the e260, I love it. The sound is much much better than what I was experiencing on the old shuffle. I had no problem syncing my music over to the device and am quite happy with the purchase."
4,Glad I bought it,"I had been looking at prices and warrenties for MP3 players for a few weeks and happened upon this product online. I am very happy with the way it works. I don't notice a difference in quality as compared to the ""name brand"" one that my friend spent 150 dollars more on!"
4,Question,"I bought this for one of my daughters, and the video IPOD for my other one who is a bit older. I love them both, the only question I have is, where does she go to download videos? Please let me know, Thanks!"
2,"Said battery would be 18 hrs, is 5 hrs","Great product, but said battery would last for 18 hrs and in practice it lasts just about as much as a cross-country airline flight."
3,sandisk 4 GB mp3,The shipping of the item was late. The item was schduled to arrive on the 25th of october but it didn't show up till the 30 of october. The item is ok. The battery power is fine it isn't really low . If you are adding any pictures or videos you have to put it through a converter which takes forever and a day. I added a family guy clip that was only 2 minutes it took 10 minutes to convert to the sandisk mp3. I didn't like the flash disk slot on the side because I bought a 4 GB flash disk and I recieved the Sandisk MP3 then I discovered that I needed a Micro disk rather than a normal flash disk. The Mp3 is still very good for $90 dollors but I am still very angry on the shipping time that the seller took to to send it to me.
2,"Think twice, think Apple","What appeared to be a simpler, less expensive way to go MP3 was a complete dissappointment. After only 2 weeks the player overloaded and froze up on me, and it was truly a great big MP3 flop. Stay with the brand you know, buy an iPod and don't buy any other MP3 player. OK, Sony makes a few worth having, but Apple, rules. Rock on..."
1,bad service,"ordered the e260 for my son's birthday, got it and it was defective from the get go. I've had several SanDisk mp3 players and this is the first bad one ever, so I sent it back to the vendor ([...]). That was a month ago, still no replacement and when i sent a request for an update I got instructions on how to get the RMA I already had. Too bad Amazon can't enforce better customer service standards on the vendors it directs us to. I still like SanDisk products but I'll look for a different vendor next time."
2,refurbished sandisk,"It came very quickly and was packaged well, but when trying to put music on the mp3 the folder could not be found and the option to delete music was gone. I am still trying to figure out how to fix this."
2,Too many software issues to consider seriously,Had this about 1 1/2 weeks. Froze up more times than I can even remember. Too bad-when working it is a nice unit but can not deal with the constant freezes and resetting needed. It was returned to Amazon for a refund.
4,Good for the Money - The Best replacement for the expensive IPOD,"Pros:The product is Nice, Great construction, Durable.The Item Works great¡ The battery charge dure many hours...I use it only for Music, but the videos looks very nice.The bad:- The random fuction is not random. It plays the song of the two consecutive folders and the go to the next two.... I expect solve this problem with a firmware actualization...- It is a little heavy for use in your shirt pocket..... But for for the car works..."
3,SanDisk Sansa e260 4 GB,"I've had this Mp3 player for about 4 years I think. No major complaints because it still functions same as the day I received it. There have been two times when all my songs got deleted for unknown reasons. Also sometimes it loses complete function and I have to unscrew the back off and take the battery out then put it back in, goes back to working like nothing ever happened lol. Other than that it is good. I have about 50 songs on it now, few videos.I use it every night because I have to have music playing while I sleep. So that's about 8 hours of running it straight and from a full charge only drains half the battery bar. Every day I have to charge it, so no biggie.Wow I just noticed I actually paid the retail price of 210$. Now you can get it for 40bucks. I got burned lol but I purchased it years ago, but wow what a difference in the price since then. It's actually only worth the price that it's listed for now instead of what I paid. Good grief lol."
2,SanDisk MP3,I tried to expand the music as far as the device would let me with the Mini SD card slot and it did not work. I have not used this device since.
4,Lasted a year and a half,"Great for the price - I played this thing EVERYDAY for about a year and a half, dropped it, lost it, found it, kicked it (accidently), spilled beer on it, and god knows what else, It was a real trooper. I had a cheapo case and a real good set of earbuds (went through 3 sets) - when it finally petered out. It only has 250MB available when after I emptied it. I just ordered the 4GB Fuze, and going to get the micro card, since it's new tech. I think I'll take better care with the new one. .....but for $60, we'll just have to see!"
4,Great mp3 Player,I love the mp3 player. But I didn't know I had to install updates in order to make it work properly.
2,Not Reccomended,"I got this player just over year ago and thought it was great. Then about 7 month into it the wheel became extremely sensitive. You couldn't even touch the wheel without the sound going up and down in either direction you turned it. Then about a month later the player would lock up on me and I couldn't skip songs change volume or even turn it off. Now, after having it for just over a year, the songs are skipping and will stop in the middle of a song and then start up like listening to a really scratched CD. It worked very well for me for the first year but has been going down hill very fast. I would recomend looking elsewhere for a media player."
3,3.5= This player turns evil...,"Ok, so I am pretty biased against Ipods, as I have never had good luck with them. I received this as a present, and it was excellent! My friend stepped on it, I was honest with customer service, and they sent me another one! Wow, this sounds like a 100% positive review so far, but trust me, it gets worse from here on out. On both of my players, I have had to reformat and reset the software at least 3 times on each player. Yes, this is not hard, but It is a pain to have to do basically every time you wish to upload music. Now, This player is very durable, the battery life does not die in the cold, and if you are a snowboarder like I am, it does not shut down in the cold like some Ipods do. So consider that..."
4,Easy to use and colorful,"I received one of these a year ago at Christmas. Mine was a refurb and I have never had any problems with it. I bought a kit online to charge it in the car nad in the wall, in addition to the USB charger it comes with. My husband and I got so much use out of mine (in the car, in the garage, on bike rides, etc.) that I got him one of his own this year for Christmas. We can't seem to fill them with music, no matter how hard we try.I have not used the video option yet, but I will soon.As a side note, the one I bought my husband was also a refurb. I have purchased many products on Amazon that are refurbs and I end up saving a lot of money and they are guaranteed to work. THey always do. The next time you have a larger ticket item, try a refurb."
4,Good quality,"When I got this mp3 payer i was generally happy. One thing I didn't like was the fact that you cant rewind or forward movies. otherwise It was cheap, innovattive, and a lot better that the ipod nano."
4,Sandisk Player,Better made than the cheaper 1G player. I am surprised at the sensitivity of the FM tuner. Usually these build in accessories are very poor and pick up only the strongest stations.
2,short lived enjoyment,I managed to sync with WMP ONCE before neither my laptop or desktop would recognize the device. I spent hours trying to fix the problem until the e260 suddenly and completely died. I sent it to Sansa but I don't expect any help . . .
5,I lost my first one and bought it again,"I lost my first Sandisc and bought it again....I think it's great and has much more in the way of features (FM radio, voice recorder for example) than my daughter's Ipod ($250) compared to $121 which is what I bought it for on Amazon. You can't go wrong. Also buy the expansion package for $13 for the belt holder etc - the Sandisc is also very cool looking - the blue light has a nice effect."
4,Awesome Overall,"It has great features, the sound is great, the look is great.. I just had one problem. When I added all of my songs to it right when I got it, there was a bunch of songs I didn't like so I plugged it in and delted them from the music folder... When I turned it back on the songs were still there on the list. When I tried to play them it would come up with ""bad track"" and skip to the next song, it still does that to this day and is very annoying. But other than that it's a great buy."
5,Love this little guy!,"I got one for Christmas. I'll admit that I was a bit skeptical, since I had wanted a Nano, but decided to keep it.I love it... It is ridiculously small and holds a ton of music. I have been using it for running on rocky, hilly off-street running, and the music does not bounce like it did on my last MP3 player. Even the earbuds work better for running. Can't wait for some more accessories to come out - I think this might be the only drawback over an iPod, but I would almost recommend it over the Apple version due to the controls."
4,e260 Mp3 Review,"I've owned my sansa since Christmas, so I guess I can right a fair review on it. First of all, this not going to be a Ipod VS. Sansa review. They are two totally different products. Anyway, I'd like to say this product is a bit buggy. I've had 2 freezes with the thing already. But, that happens with all mp3 players, I seem to hear anymore. Well, the picture is quite good, and it's not hard to use. The computer reconizes it in a short period of time. And, then WMP10 will be able to sync music on to it. I do enjoy the fact it has the expansion slot, since if you become a music freak, it's okay. This is good for it's money, and will hold up a while. A thing about it is, that is scratches extremely easily, so I'd suggest getting a case with a screen cover. It's probably a good investment, and I am yet to buy a case. But, the sound quality is good, and I am pleased. I would recommend this product."
2,san,I bought this product for my frequent travel.(1) Music - It plays most mp3 versions. Avg equilaizer. Avg sound quality. GOOD head phones(2) Video - Only plays supported format thro the convertor s/w(3) Radio - Very poor - Not able to tune to exact frequency. Has more noise - No manual / fine tune(4) Picture - Only BMP is supported.Product outlook is good.Avg product
3,Sansa e260,"This player is fine but the specification is misleading. In the web site of Sansa.com it shows this MP4 player has multiple languages, it actually has a few. It even shows us the picture of the MP4 with those foreign languages in side the menu. Unfortunately, some of the languages I want do not have them installed in the player we buy here in this country, only those from the foreign countries will have the foreign languages (e.g. Japanese, Chinese). I ended up calling them many times and Sansa passed my ticket around the whole world to find another one to swap it with me....It is very troublesome..."
1,Junk,"Other than the portability due to it's size, and the good battery life....this thing is junk. Has been since day one of it's arrival. When it arrived, the battery was dead. The seller refunded some money so I could purchase a battery for it.The thing lost files, and was not functioning correctly. Furthermore, Sandisk is not..repeat not...supporting this with anymore updates. This is a bad device, and I would not recommend any one to purchase it. The sound quality is poor.I really can't say much else about this thing other than it sucks."
1,Don't buy SANSA,Get an Ipod. I've tried 2 Sansa MP3 players and they both quit working after 6 months.
2,well at least i didn't waste alot of money.,"Lets start by saying i have had scandisk products before, and they were a pretty good product. This particular product is by far the lowest quality lowest recomended, lowest bidder built piece of garbage that i have ever owned. For the same general price point, i would recomend the coby, or spend the extra money and get a zune. i had a n ipod nano, and if it werent for itunes, i would have kept it. it is slow, cumbersome to navigate, and the sound quality is poor. (compared to the ipod, coby, and zune)i DO NOT recomend this to anyone."
3,Not the best but I like it,"The media coverter can't seem to detect my device so I have to drag and drop everthing which is annoying because there's never any order and I like my files organized, that also means the videos and photo can't be viewed but hey the music plays so that's good enough for me. Besides it was only 40 bucks you get what you pay for."
1,Complaint,"I would like to be able to review this item, however, I it cannot be operated because...IT WAS SHIPPED BY AMAZON WITHOUT A USER MANUAL OR ANY INSTRUCTIONS. I have requested this information IMMEDIATELY be sent to the recipient who is visibly upset over the inept actions of Amazon relative to this matter but this has NOT been done!!!!"
1,Over-charged for shipping,"This company charged me $45 for ""expidited"" mail service and yet they can't get the MP3 to me until after Christmas!! I ordered the Friday before Christmas - every other place I ordered online (including Amazon who only charged $18 for express delivery and a guarantee that it would be here on the 24th) is able to provide the material before Christmas and for WAY less than these jerks. Sorry folks, you charged fully HALF (more than half!) of what I paid for the equipment to ship it to me with a delivery date past Christmas. Will NEVER order from these guys again!"
1,Disappointment,"I went to BestBuy to purchase a 1GB shuffler (for running) and a regular ipod 30GB for my long commute everyday 2.5hr. The sales person recommended the Sansa 260e, for $190 4GB and all the options it made sense for me to purchase it.....however file transfer was confusing (MCP mode all the songs displays unknown) while connected to USB can not use the sansa, also the unit comes with sample songs which it freezed the unit, but it dose not have a reset button so you have to wait till battery drains. One good thing was video transfer was simple and worked. Unfortunately I have to get the ipod but I'm glad I decided to purchase it locally vs. shipping"
2,DON'T BUY THIS!,Dead in less than a week. Do not buy until they work out all of the bugs. I am still trying to get a replacement.
2,Not very good,"The user guide for this device is pathetic. They don't even give you basic instructions on how to use Windows Media Player to synch with the device. Unless you use Windows Media Player, the device only has one play list. Anyway, I got it figured out now, no thanks to SanDisk.The device is ok. It's no iPod, but at least it's not proprietary--you can copy MP3s to it like a flash drive, but only after you set it to MSC mode (Settings > USB Mode > MSC). You only get one play list in the MSC mode. Someone got this for me as a gift; if I had researched it myself, I most likely would NOT have gotten it."
4,MP3 Player,"The Apple IPod interface is unsurpassed but I do not want to use ITunes. However, this unit's menu interface is acceptable. The menus are fairly intuitive but needing some definition. Finding the user manual on the manufacturer's web site was a challenge. The unit excels at battery life and sound reproduction. Its small size is great for the mobile person and the display is decent. I like the ability to replace the battery when it dies. Would I buy it again? Yes, but I would probably look at some other units since this is my first experience with and MP3 player."
4,New Sansa fan,"Nice features, good price.I bought it as a gift for my 9 year old. He's somewhat rough on electronics and I wanted to get him something that had full features but wasn't terribly expensive. When we started using it, I found that it has a load of features and the controls are very intuitive. It also syncs directly with Windows Media Player, so you don't have to load a special software package for it. We haven't needed the extra space yet, but you can also put a memory card in it to expand the memory. If I didn't already have a Zune, I would be getting a Sansa for myself."
4,Pure quality,It is well built and easy to use. It is a gift for my oldest son. He's been using it since Christmas and says it is easier to use than an iPod. He likes its quality of workmanship.
4,Good for price but had some trouble,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and it worked fine for a few weeks and then it kept freezing...Amazon was great with replacing it though-I had a new one in just 3 days...good size, good capacity and pretty durable (one of my biggest concerns)...Overall I would recommend to anyone looking for an mp3 that is small but sounds good.."
4,VERY GOOD PLAYER,"This is a very good player. It is easy to use and download music. It holds a week's worth of music. The playback quality is excellent. I have two small issues with this unit. First I would like it to play the music in the order that I want. The player chooses the order of the music that is played (alphabetically, random, genre). It will not play them in the order that I want them played. The second issue being; I would like to increase the volume. When I plug it into my car stereo, the volume is low. I have to increase the stereo's volume a lot to match that of CD's. With the headphones on it is plenty loud. These issues are not enough to keep me from recommending this unit or purchasing another in the future."
3,Good not Great,I have the 4GB Sansa e260. It works great. The screen is bright and very easy to see. Putting music on the device is simply. You can use Media Player or just click and drag. The blue lit wheel is a very nice touch. I haven't tried the SD slot yet. I do have some problems with the device. The menu system is not very well designed. (if you really care) The radio doesn't come in so well indoors. The forward and back buttons can be hard to hit or miss hit if you have big hands. Over all it works and works good. I do recommend this if you want an alternative to the I-pod or Zune.
1,Disappointed,"I received the unit, charged it and instead of a display it just had some white boxes. Maybe it is just because I do not order a lot of electronics (and when I do they work) but to be broken out of the box made me lose all confidence in the product and not want to simply replace it. Amazon was great at providing a refund. I am going to pay more and stick with Sony products which have lasted great for me."
5,Everything I Need!!!,"Wow! I love this player!!! It is very easy to use, especially when partnering it with Rhapsody. The expansion slot is great, since it uses MicroSD cards(very cheap!) Although apparently 2GB is the max for now... I dont really use it for video, mainly because it takes forever to encode and transfer them. The only vids I transfer are music videos. The player has a great FM radio function, which I use a lot, to find new bands to download with Rhapsody! Sound quality is amazing, and the little blue menu wheel is a lot of fun. I strongly reccomend this to anyone who is thinking about buying an Ipod Nano."
1,Nightmare on Sansa Street,"I just bought this e260 (11/08). The player itself was manufactured in 2006 and still being sold as new by Amazon and JR's Computer world.The product information fails to leave out the fact that you can only use a 2gb mirco sd card, it will not recognize anything else. So forget about SDHC compatibility.Speaking of compatibility you can not hear audible.com book content on it and will never be able to.If you want album art you have to find it on the internet and install it manually in each album folder (big pain). Most players will automatically do this when you sync with windows media player or your preferred download service.Now to continue the nightmare I went on the Sansa site to try to fix all the stuff that is not compatible with the rest of the world and it was listed as a ""retired player"" So you can forget about any support.I just bought nothing more than the electronic version of a gallon of outdated, rotten milk."
5,Sansa e260,Easy to use perfect for my uses. I use it for watching BBC shows and listening to music. Holds 4 seasons of shows plus. Better picture than the later players.
2,Disappointment,"This item worked great for about 5 min. Unfortunately, it died after that and only worked when plugged into a/c or USB port. Battery did not charge. Since I was really wanting to use this player for running, it was quite a disappointment. I gave it 2 stars for how I think it probably would work with a battery and for the semi-helpful customer service. However, I still haven't received my reimbursement after almost 2 weeks... that's a generous 2 stars."
3,Not too bad,"I've had this since August. It works pretty well. The sound is clean, it's easy to manage the directory, and so on. But right off I had a problem using various media players to manage its content and playlists, and fell back on using its ""I'm a USB drive"" mode to transfer content (which also involved finding the hidden Music folder). Then, about a month ago, it began to crash on me. It was rare at first, but now it crashes mid-song several times a day. The only way to fix it is to yank the back panel and pull the battery.Its physical durability is pretty decent. I have a very rough lifestyle, and everything I carry gets dropped, scratched, or battered at some point, not to mention exposure to dust and extreme temperatures. Aside from a crack in the screen and some paint on the back panel, and the aforementioned crashing problem, it still functions."
4,Won't work with a mac! Otherwise great.,"Just a note to potential buyers who may have mac computers. Previous generations of sandisk players would work on a mac, but this one won't. I've just talked to two separate Sandisk tech support people who said slightly different things, but both said NOT to use it with a mac. The first one said that the mac would corrupt its system, the second just said it wouldn't work right.In fact, it crashes my mac system if used as a regular USB peripheral would be, requiring a hard powerdown to unfreeze the mac.Do NOT buy one of these and assume it'll work with your mac.I do like the player, and would recommend it highly to you windoze users."
4,Sansa e260 4gb mp3 player,"I was peeking around for an mp3 player that would hold more than ten minutes' worth of tunes but didn't have to have enough space for the Congressional Library's archive of music. And thus, I settled on this one.goods-sturdy; not invincible, but sturdy contstruction-radio-fluid file transfer; just click and drag folders or files-good sound quality, and it has a volume inhibiter so you don't blow out your eardrums, you pantywaist, you.bads-has frozen up once or twice. just unscrewed the battery cover, disconnected the battery, reconnected and closed up. seemed to solve the problem-some files corrupted for no apparent reason (but then again, i'm no techie wiz). ended up formatting the whole memory, and haven't had a problem since.quite pleased so far, so if you're like me and don't want an iPod because theyr'e EVERYWHERE, this is a purty darn good buy (and a hell of a lot less flimsy than the Nano)"
4,Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot,Good sound quality. Great battery life. I played songs all day and the battery life meter was still almost full. I've had it for 2 weeks now and only charded it before first use.Paul
4,Sandisk 4 GB MP3 Player,"I find the device easy to use and so far I've had no problems with it. The only drawback is that you have to connect it to a USB port to charge it. Sandisk should sell it with a home charger, at least that is what I would like; therefore, only 4 stars."
4,quite good but some troubles,I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT INSTEAD OF AN IPOD BECAUSE YOU CAN EASILY CHANGE THE BATTERY (INSTEAD OF AN EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT WITH APPLE IPOD) AND BECAUSE IT HAS A RADIO AND YOU CAN RECORD FROM IT. I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT BUT A FEW DAYS LATER IT FROZE. APPARENTLY IT HAS TO DO WITH SOME PROBLEM WITH WINDOWS. FORTUNATELY THE PEOPLE FROM TECNICHAL SANSDISK SUPPORT WERE VERY HELPFUL AND FOLLOWING THEIR ADVICE I WAS ABLE TO RESET IT ( I THINK YOU ACTUALLY FORMAT THE DISK INSIDE)BUT I LOST ALL THE INFORMATION STORED. NOW I AM HAPPY AGAIN BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM I HAD CAN HAPPEN TO OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY SHOULD SOLVE IT BEFORE SELLING THE PRODUCT
5,Great Little mp3 Player,"Ordered 2 - 1 for my son and 1 for me and we're both very happy.Until now, never thought that I had a reason to own an mp3 player. Now, I'm sorry that I waited so long. In fact, let me restate that - I'm glad I waited to buy this Sansa E260! Doesn't have the iPod name or advertising behind it, but much lower in price, has unlimited expandability (via MicroSD cards), FM radio and overall quality makes up for any differences to me.As for my son, he is very happy with his present and tells me that his Sansa works and sounds just as good as his friend's iPod's. That's enough for me to say that these were excellent buys."
4,Amazing gadget!!!,"I've been using the 2nd generation ipod nano up until these past couple of months when I'd been looking for an mp3 player that can do more than just play music. This little gadget can do SO much more than the ipod nano and it the same length and width but a little bit thicker than the nano. Everything works wonderfully but the only thing I've been having issues with is getting the video files to work. I'll have to spend a bit more time trying to figure out how to convert them to the correct files. Also, the battery lasts FOREVER. I listened to music on my new sansa e280 for a train ride (total of ~4-5 hours) and the battery bar finally went down from 100% to about 90%!! If I'd been listening to my nano it for sure would have died after the first few hours. I love my new sansa and highly recommend it!"
2,Started good but now it doesn't work,"I never really liked this mp3 player. I have had it for about 1 year now. When I first got it worked but had some bugs. Songs not showing up in the playlist and minor things like that. As time went on it began to lock up on regular basis. I updated its firmware but it still crashes. I have around 100 songs on it and today added 4 more songs. When I plugged in the earphones the only songs on it were the 4 that I just added. I hooked it up to my computer to verify that the songs were really gone and they were. Tried both modes too. MTP and MSC. Enough is enough. I am done with it. This thing has never been dropped doesn't even have one scratch, or speck of dust on it. I will never buy anything from this company again. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because it kind of worked for 1 year."
2,Not a long lived device,"This little player is really easy to use, and stores a lot more than I figured it would.It was a birthday present for my boyfriend, and unfortunately my one real complaint with it is that the media converter seems to be having trouble with Vista - but he's on a dial up connection on someone else's computer while his is out of commission - but music is really easy to put onto it, just plop them into the folder and there ya go.UPDATE: This product broke about a month after purhcase - and he didn't think to contact sandisk immediately, so by the time I'd found out and we called, they said there was nothing to be done about it...so don't expect longevity."
2,Better Products Available,"The first Sandisk was under warranty when it crashed. Since I've had the replacement, I've dealt with continual frustration trying to get the software and the system to function as it should. An internal sound issue has occured where neither the headphones or DLO FM transmitter work. Tech Support only says there is nothing they can do. DO NOT BUY SANDISK. There are much better products available on the market."
5,nano killer!!,"great player. 50$ bucks cheaper than nano is what made me buy this. but then its features keep amazing me. fm player, recorder, fm recorder, photo viewer, video player, cool looking. i have run it for two weeks now and have faced no major problems.downsides:1) doesnt come with armband.2) Slideshow feature doesnt work3) slightly heavier and probably thicker than nano"
2,Problems with Sansa.,"There's a lot to like about this mp3, however they seem to have some serious quality control issues. We bought two and have had to replace 1 once and the other twice. The good news is that they go bad while still under warranty. If not for what to me is a huge problem, I would rate this product at least 4 stars."
5,excellent product,"I have found the Sansa player easy to use, has a good tone and is overall an excellent product."
3,"Works, yet not very well","Lets start from the beggining. It takes quite a while to turn on, and if you would like to select a song from an album you need to first start the first song on the album then go through a series of controls to get to the song bank for that album. Whenever the mp3 is left sitting for a while or bumped slightly it turns off and then it takes a while to turn on. Don't even get me started on the Rhapsody software needed to load the sandisk with your music. On the bright side, you can use this to listen to your music. . . that is if you don't mind the constant hassle of this user-unfriendly devise.James Day"
2,Needs to be fixed,"I'm on my second pump and it has failed too. The problem with this pump is that the rubber gasket that protects the motor fails. It's not sealed properly and water will get inside the electrical parts. Once this happens, your GFI and/or circuit breaker will trip and the pump will turn off. I took apart the first one and found this out. I dried it out and plugged it back in. It worked. I then used aquarium sealant and sealed the motor from getting any water inside. I now have 2 pumps that work since doing this. They told me to throw away the first one. This pump would be 5 stars if it didn't break so quick. All they need to do is seal the motor better and it's a great pump. It may last 6 months at most before the gasket fails. I've had it running for 2 years now after fixing it and I have a back up waiting if it does break."
2,Disppointed...,"We are on our second pump ... first one started throwing GFI breaker after 18 months. We were told it was cost prohibitive to repair and better to replace. Because our water feature is large and this pump provides a good water flow, we went with the same pump the second time - hoping that the first pump was faulty. Well, 18 months in, it is having the same issue as the first. I'm not sure how long pumps are supposed to last, but 18 months seems awfully short. We are going to try drying it out as suggested in another review and adding extra sealer. At this point we have nothing to lose in trying to repair this one. If it doesn't work, we will be shopping for another manufacturer that hopefully has better durability."
5,This book,This book saving a lot of money on repairs my boat I love the boat I love the book I don't like the boat so I appreciate it if you would just keep making these books does that great when you have to fix it
1,Great Disappointment,"This tool arrived very dirty and dusty.... like it just came in from a hard day's work. Also, it didn't work at all... it wouldn't even spin. The motor would run, but I think the gears were internally stripped. The housing had the little ""R"" stamped on it, but I think this one came in the back door and went out the front without any work. Back to Bosch for me."
1,Just had to rate this item,"I normaly don't write a review, especialy on somethings that i almost got for free ( had a $25.00 coupon, for a $49.00 purchased) But i just hated how this unit performed that i had to say something, first one I received I had to send it back, it was dirty the chuck was worn out and it smelled like it was salvage from a burned down store. the replacement was not any better either, it just do not hold down the drill bits it keeps on coming off, this was not a good first experiance with hitachi tools and certainly the very last. I read some of the positive reviews about how you should get a heavy duty hammer drill for some specific jobs, I agree with them, but for what the unit claims and the work i was doing it should had handle it with no problems. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET A DEWALT INSTEAD."
5,Sweet....................,"This thing is better than sliced bread, cell phones, and ATM machines put together. It really kicks (you know what)."
3,A Sad Disappointment,"I have to agree with Amanda - this set was a total disappointment to me. I've been a Martin & Lewis fan forever and a huge Dino fan even longer. To eliminate his songs from the set was almost sacreligious to me! Part of watching the shows was waiting for Dean to sing his heart out! Why this was done, I will never understand. Also, Dean & Jerry singing ""We Belong Together"" was cut out as well. Its nice in a way to relive the ""old fashioned"" commercials back then, but to take out Dean's songs - Sorry guys that hurt! The only reason I gave it 3 stars was its still worth watching the two of them in action and seeing the love and admiration they had for each other."
5,Great collection.,"This was a gift for my husband. It arrived in time for Christmas and is very funny according to my husband. These are not shows I've ever seen before, but that's what makes it special."
3,Nice little book on change,"Here are the 12 great principles that the book teaches on changing your mind so your life will then change.1>Take care yourself. First and foremost.2>Focus on solutions not the problems.3>Try your best and don't try to contol the outcome.4>Change your mind daily, do not cling to your opinions if proven wrong.5>Choose to be proactive instead of reactive.6>Quit judging yourself and every one else.7>Remember that you are not in control.8>Discover your own lessons.Learn and change from this.9>Do no Harm.10>Quiet your mind.11>Every encounter is a holy encounter .Respond accordingly.12>There are two voices in your mind one is always wrong.The author has been through a lot of hardships in her life and writes with great clarity and compassion. If you would like to read her take on how to live the above 12 principle buy this book.If you already have those areas covered, look for more advanced reading else where."
5,life-changing book,"This small book, written in a gentle, conversational tone, would change the world if everyone read it and tried to apply its wisdom. I ended up buying it after borrrowing it from a library because there is so much good stuff to be highlighted. While the title is about changing your thoughts, a predominant goal of the book is to promote peace in our own lives, which leads to more peace in the world. This is really a special piece of writing."
5,Excellent ! Simple to Understand-Practical Steps to Grow,"I have been impressed with Ms. Casey's works for several years. I don't often write reviews,but I felt compelled to make an exception in this case. The reason? So often when people are struggling to learn and change in difficult times they are overwhelmed with they're circumstances and can't (or aren't capable of) of delving into deep ""complex"" Spiritual or Cognitive Self-Help readings. Ms Casey's book shed's light are some common and very debilitating issues...but just as important as the identification,she offers simple suggestions to address them- immediately and effectively. Can't go wrong..."
2,"sorry I ""upgraded""","I was used to Finale 2006, and regret having purchased this upgrade. It locks up; plug-ins don't work the way they should; and tech support is useless- the fixes they suggest have already been tried, and perhaps they don't realize that the program doesn't always work the way it's supposed to. I've reinstalled it twice, and still have problems. Some plug-ins and staff styles can be applied to scores (if they work), but will be cancelled in linked or extracted parts! I hate it."
2,Suntime kids' sports watch,"After sometime of wear, the white numbers on the dial face faded off. The decor on the watch band peels off mostly around the buckle and the end of the watch band."
5,Underdash enclosure,This arrived on time and the Kenwood stereo fit in the enclosure perfectly. The enclosure has a sleek look and looks great under my dashboard of a vintage Chevy. It was also quite easy to mount but did require a support bracket in the back.
2,might outlast a 6 month subscription,"I have owned two of these, and both of them died.The first one was replaced under warranty, but when the second one died, I gave up.These things are no good, this is why it is not available."
1,Don't buy this illegal bootleg. The artistes do not benefit.,"This version is an inferior, illegal copy of this historic album. The artistes who made the album do not benefit in any way from the sale of this, only the criminals distributing it do. You can buy an version on vinyl and CD from Sunbeam Records that is authorised by the band members and includes extensive sleeve notes."
4,Brand New Cd of DJ,This Cd is another great cd for DJ Skribble and I want everyone to go out and buy it. It's great for parties and just to listen to when hanging out with our friends!
1,Not Good At All,"OK, let me start by saying I have always hated DJ Skribble. But I saw some of the songs on here and I liked most of them, so I decided to buy this album. BIG MISTAKE! Like stated earlier, if you are a casual (very casual) listner of electronic music then you may appreciate this album. If not, stay away from it and save your money! Skribble somehow manages to destroy all of the good songs on this CD by adding his own items to the songs (he successfully RUINED my favorite song on the CD, ""I Wanna Be You"" by Chocolate Puma by adding Tamia's hook into the breakdown before the song starts again! TERRIBLE!). The other few good songs on here you could find elsewhere on different compilations (and with better versions of the songs I might add). Thanks for nothing Skribble! Hey, on the bright side, at least I now know NEVER to buy anything from him again no matter what songs are on the disc!"
4,Pretty Good for DJ Scribble...,"Hey this CD is sooooo much better then the Essential Dance 2000! I think Scribble may have learned a few things since then. The song selection is great, he uses some of the top dance tracks from the UK, and the mixing is better then the Essential Dance 2000. I recommend this CD to Scribble fans as well as fans of UK dance & club music."
5,Long time favorite,"I got these when I first started working out several years ago and I've been using these since. They have no taste at all, since the outer layer is some sort of clear gel. I've never really swallowed pills until I first bought these, and it seemed easy enough for me. It's got a great mix of vitamins to keep you healthy."
2,This product didn't work out for me,"Nice idea and well made, however, the fuse in my minivan blew on my 3rd use of the item. I guess you need heavy duty fuses in order to be able to use this item."
3,Works mostly well!,"Cooks brown rice well. Oatmeal takes twice as long as it should. Heats soups or liquids fast but not to a boil. I just tried popcorn for the 1st time and 3 kernels popped in an hour, the rest look burned. I had to give up because the cord felt too hot. I will try the popcorn one more time!!! :( :) This pot is handy for a truck driver like me and it does the job I need it to do!!!"
5,The Future has Not Yet Been Determined.,"In 1999 The Dragons of Heaven will gather in Tokyo to prevent the Dragons of Earth from destroying humanity and returning the planet to it's original state. Kamui must choose which group to join. Even though many believe that the future has already been decided, Kamui is determined to create his own future.This anime is yet another CLAMP masterpiece. It has great animation, characters, and voice actors. The story and plot twists are done amazingly. The drama is X gets pretty intense. This is a story of love, and loss. It can be very touching at times. I can't say enough great things about this series. It's fantastic. I hope you enjoy watching it.P.S. I almost forgot to mention that the movie is awful. It's a slapdash mess that tries to put an entire series together in an hour. Don't waste your money."
1,If I wanted a story read to me I'd get an audiobook.,"Ok, so I read the back of the box for this anime and thought the story sounded good, so I purchased it based on that. But when I got home and began to watch it it became boring very quickly. The characters spend about 90% of the time flatly stating what they're thinking and feeling instead of showing it through facial expressions, emotion, actions, etc. What's worse is the dialogues weren't even interesting most of the time. For what I thought was going to be an action anime there was VERY little action and I only finished watching it because I had purchased it and it would've been a waste not to. This could've been a great anime if it were executed differently but as it stands it's hardly worth your time."
2,Review,"The first thing that grabbed my attention was the art work of the box cover. Just looking at it made me crave to buy it. Heres my take on it, the very VERY brief fight scenes were decent nothing special, the art work was decent very typical anime art work. Overall I honestly hated this series and wish I didnt buy it. WHen I watch anime , I want great fight scenes, kick ass music, a good follow aloung plot and I didnt get any of that frim this.."
1,x,this is a partially fair review--- as i saw up to episode 4.. so maby it gets better....i got bored... tons of dialoge very little action going on... if there going to be heroes give them things to do would be helpful...oh yes... another good reason i had for me at least... the guy who is supposed to be the strongest of the seven heroes... is a complete jerk.. he attacks just about anyone who comes near him.. the show didn't give an explanation as to why he's that way. but each to his own.... i guess i dont like just any show. maby 2 stars for good graphics .... finding anime in good graphics should be something to persue.
1,trying to hard,"I did love the Hebrew names in this edition. As I continued in the Word, however, I noticed the author was trying to push too hard to put his own views into the Word of YHVH. I would not want to be in his shoes on judgement day! One of his own beliefs that do not line up with the Holy Scriptures is he claims satan is a female! There were too many inconsistencies in this version, and I would not recommend it."
3,remember 1thes.5:20,"a great book, easy to read, it's nice to have the proper names replaced in scripture...a very great help in my studies but please, please keep in mind the title of this reveiw...especially in mal4:1, Is2:2-5 Is43:1-13, Is44:1-8, 45:4, 49:1-3, may yahweh bless your understanding..."
1,Not Even A Translation,"The Book of Yahweh claims to be a work of scholarship. I must disagree. It takes one verse - Genesis 1:1 - to realize the this ""Bible"" is the work of someone with an agenda. No reputable, honest scholar on this planet translates Genesis 1:1, ""In the beginning, Yahweh..."" It doesn't get any better, either. The Book of Yahweh is NOT a translation of the paleo-Hebrew or any other Hebrew. It's grand and glorious claims in the Preface are - although fantastic - mostly fantasy. If you have interest in The Sacred Names - and serious students of the Bible should be interested in The Sacred Names for a variety of reasons - save your bucks and purchase a real translation, not a human's opinion."

5,Best Bible Translation ever,"This Bible is made from quality material,the content is i believe the best translation i have read.I would fully reccomend it!"
1,PAULS DISAPPEARANCE,"THIS ""AUTHOR?"" IS IN THE EMPLOY OF THE GOD OF THIS WORLD. ALL HE WANTS IS A FOLLOWING, WHICH IN TURN BRINGS HIM IN MONEY, THE NAME OF THE GAME IN THIS WORLD. HE ABSOLUTELY AND COMPLETELY REMOVES ALL OF THE NEW TESTAMENT WRITTEN BY PAUL SO THAT HIS, YISRAYL HAWKINS', FOLLOWERS WILL SUBMIT AGAIN TO THE LAW OF MOSES AND OF COURSE HIMSELF. MAYBE, MAYBE THE ONLY REDEEMING QUALITY ( AND I USE THIS WORD CAUTIOUSLY ) OF THIS BOOK IS THAT HE USES THE CORRECT NAME OF THE CREATOR AND HIS SON IN ALL THE PLACES ""HE"" SAYS THEY BELONG. THIS BOOK IS ONLY GOOD FOR A REFERENCE ""?"" AND THAT IS TO BE DONE WITH BACKUP FROM A MOST RELIABLE SOURCE, YHWH HIMSELF."
5,People just don;t understand,"I start this review off by stating that ""people just don't understand"". The book of Yahweh is simplified in plain english. I have many, many hebrew and jewish friends who all agree that todays modernized hebrew language is rather ""a slang form"" of hebrew and far different from the original hebrew manuscripts. And this was proven easily. ""Gesenius, Brown driver & Briggs and several chaldee lexicons were used to aid in the translation of the book of Yahweh.(all of which are listed as reference and resource maaterial) Yet, when I showed a few of my hebrew friends these books, they did not understand the language and stated ""This is a very old dialect"".My point is this, NOONE can disproove the book of Yahweh translation unless they spend years researching the hebrew text and the language as these fine scholars have, and who have given us such a marvelous translation of the greatest book in the world......Debate all day if you like, but I LOVE MY BOOK OF YAHWEH."
2,Not for novice,"A very confusing version of the bible, It dosen't matter if we call Jesus, Jesus or Yusua. It is believing in the message of the gospel that counts. No this bible is not a real good reading bible. It pretty much is as worth wild as the New Worlds Translation."
1,pharisaic law shoving,"Sent it back 2 days after receiving it. After reading about Yahshua's quote ""It's not what goes into a mans stomach that makes him unclean..."" and seeing a note below stating that ""Yahshua is not calling ""unclean"" foods ""clean"". It looked to me like the translators were trying to convince me to follow the old pharisaic laws. Similar to when Kepha was trying to get the Gentiles to get circumcised. An anti-Gentile attitude in my opinion."
4,Headset,The product Worked wellI Would recommendI Would buy againArrived on time as stated onlineVery Cost effective
2,Not worth the price,"Look at the logitech USB headphones, which I've also reviewed: Logitech 980356-0403 Stereo USB Headset 250. I would reccommend that over this pair. This costs twice as much, and it's not even a true USB headset. It connnects through a USB codec. The sound is ok, but the microphone boom seems very fragile and inconvenient to raise and lower compared to the logitech. It doesn't get 1 star because it does its job, but if I had to buy another pair, I would buy the logitech again."
2,Not Good,"Keep looking! Made cheap for a sony product, I returned it and bought a cheaper better made product."
1,ICE BREAKERS-WRONG PRODUCT,"I ORDERED ALPINE SPLASH AND WAS SHIPPED CINNAMON INSTEAD. IT WAS OKAY AS A SUBSTITUTE AND I DIDN'T COMPLAIN AS I GUESSED THAT THEY WERE OUT OF ALPINE SPLASH. WHEN I ANSWERED YOUR PREVIOUS SURVEY WITH THIS INFORMATION I RECEIVED A NASTY PHONE MESSAGE FROM THE COMPANY THAT SEEMED TO BLAME ME FOR THE SCREW UP.REGARDS, AL TROWBRIDGE"
5,Cranial and Visceral fascia,Gil is a master in explaining the world of Fascisa.A must for everybody that works in the body-work field
5,Cyber Goth At Its Best,"While maybe not as aggressive as the previous two albums. The album openly embraces keyboards and samples and uses them to full effect. Not that this is somekind of techno album, far from it. It uses the samples, effects etc as merely a enhancement of the crunching riffs and soaring vocals. The melodies are tighter while there are enough suprises to keep you interested and loving every second. Plus the cover of house of the rising sun is inspired!"
3,Too Easy,"This game is pretty fun but like the original Air Attack, it is just too easy. I beat it in two days and there were only two missions I didn't beat on the first try. This game is not as good as the original. In this game you get only two weapons, one which your copilot specializes in, and one which comes with the particular helicopter you're using. A cool feature is that there are powerups which give you double or triple machine guns. There are more levels featuring huge toys which will do all the work for you if you let them. And the last level is a snap when compared with Air Attack 1's last level.The two player mode is the best feature. There are several different game types, including deathmatch, capture the flag, and one where you try to find one of each type of food item before your opponent. There is also a two-player cooperative mode.Overall, I recommend renting this game, not buying it."
3,THIS IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS,"You blow up tanks and kill plastic men. the problem is you can't get to the 15th, out of 20, level. Its just to hard!"
3,Not Bad,"This episode has good action, but some of the plot and dialogue is pretty cheesy. You can probably afford to skip this one unless you are a Kirk fan."
1,Dreadful,"The musical style is one I like--reminiscent of early 1980s New Order. But this singing is so utterly awful and out of key, and the guitar playing is so awful, and the beat so out of rhythm, this album is unlistenable."
3,This Will Work But You Are Paying For The Sony Name,"Yep, this will work for you. But why pay over $10.00 for something with the Sony brand on it, when you can get a no name brand that is just as good, will work just as well, and costs around two bucks?I have a bag of these and they come in handy in my work. But save yourself some money and get a generic like theARISTA 16-097 3.5mm (Mini) to 6.3mm (1/4"") Headphone Adapter.But watch for the shipping, which many times will cost you a lot more than the adapter itself!"
3,No SkyBox,Nothing wrong with the adaptor - just don't buy it from SkyBox. They charge $8.48 shipping for a common $1.97 part.
3,Sony PC-234S Audio Plug Adaptor review,"Saler did not inform me this device is include in the wiresless headphones, so I purchased inecesary this item."
3,Not up to Par with His Earlier Work,"Overboard is a fine read, but it lacks the dramatic tension of both Jaws 2 and Jaws the Revenge. I doubt if this one will be adapted for the big screen like the others."
5,In Vietnam he was the best....he still is!,"Deadly Prey is the most perfect action/adventure/inadvertent comedy film of all time. The story line is more detailed on the back of the box than in the movie, and that's what I love about it. The action is amazing, with knives, grenades, severed limbs, and a huge log. This movie blew me away and then set me up just to knock me down again. I have only one word to describe this flick...""RUN!!!"""
5,Piracy,"Sorry to tell you guys but anybody selling these movies on DVD are selling you cheap, pirated copies.David A PriorWriter, Director, Producer"
4,Solid 80's Action Flick,"Deadly Prey is a solid 80's action movie directed by the same guy who directed Killer Workout. However, it never achieves greatness because we've seen all of this done before in movies such as Rambo and Commando. Still, it's a well done rip-off and worth seeing if you like 80's action."
3,Not as good as the previous,"Thomas Perry is an amazing writer, but somehow I didn't feel that this latest venture meets his high standards. There is the usual Jane Whitefield dance with her evil pursuers, close calls, and a subtext that you don't figure out till the end. Neverthless, the fact that Jane is performing her magic not out of her devotion to her work, but because she is somewhat reluctantly pushed into it, robs the story of its customary magic. Thomas, let Jane live out a quiet life with her husband, and write about Jane's earlier adventures instead.The only thing I can't figure out is - how did Thomas Perry go from writing amazing and humorous crime noir like ""Metzger's Dog"" and the ""Butcher's Boy"", to the somber (but no less readable) Jane Whitefield?"
3,Too Much Filler,"This was a good story, but it was fleshed out with too much tedious detail. I've enjoyed all of the Jane Whitefield novels and this was no exception, but it was not my favorite."
3,The Face Changers,"Thomas Perry is a fine writer and his novels are very well-constructed. I think the conceit of an Indian woman who knows how to make people in danger 'disappear' is clever, and his explanations of just how she does it are always interesting and believable. Jane Whitfield is not, however, an entirely believable character. She is just too good: she is never petty or venal or self-indulgent or anything but wise, judicious, strong and virtuous. Thomas Perry makes up for that with his intelligent prose, intricate plotting and his wit. Altogether worth reading."
5,Protector of the Innocent,"Jane Whitefield is a marvelous addition to the pantheon of females defending the good guys and defeating the bad guys. Her persona as a spiritual guide creates a twist that is novel and fascinating. Her super-hero powers are pretty good, too."
5,Another winner!,"Thomas Perry has done it again! The always facinating Jane Whitfield kept me glued to the pages. I read non-stop until 1:00 a.m., and was sorry to finish it. I wanted more!I hope Mr. Perry never runs out of excuses to send Jane on the run to save another lost soul."
4,How about some myth changers?,"""Face Changers"" is Mr. Perry's usual good work. I truly enjoyed the book.However, I WISH WISH WISH that people would do some research before writing about ironworkers.While Perry did dispel the notion that Native Americans have some kind of magic gene that eliminates a fear of heights, he perpetuates the myth that there is some small tribe of Indians roaming the US, building skyscrapers.It is not, and has never been true.And it's just stupid.My husband has been a union ironworker for 34 years.No, he is not an Indian.The International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental, and Reinforcing Ironworkers has more than 150,000 members in about 200 union locals in the US and Canada.According to ""Resisting in High Places: A Study of First Nation Mohawk Ironworker,"" by Michael B. Elmes, ironworkers' union membership is only about five percent Native American.Since ironworkers figure in all of the Jane Whitefield books, perhaps Mr. Perry can do some fact checking."
2,Now I remember why I hated the Butcher's Boy,"The writing is OK but the premise is driving me insane. The characters travel to some destination where the bad guys can't possibly find them but there they are! At every friggin' turn no matter how unlikely...Arrgg! The Butcher's Boy was the same way, they travel to some random city and as soon as they show their faces some random bad guy is there to not only see them but to take them out. If you don't mind plot holes you'll love this book."
4,Interesting & rewarding,"This is the 2nd novel I've read of the Jane Whitefield series. She is able and capable as a helper/guide, but lacks the quality a hard boiled guide needs to succeed at helping the good guys: The cold indifference towards the bad guys. It is just not believable that she would risk drowning or being shot at by diving back to save the woman who just tried to murder her in cold blood. In spite of that, the book is a good read."
4,Fun But Frustrating,"I played Jinx at the Sphinx on easy all the way through. I am at the second suspect in The Scary Stone Dragon on easy. Jinx is frustrating at times because you have to go back and forth a lot among six or so places. In a few instances, it is hard to discern where the cursor needs to be. I plan to play Jinx on harder (spookier). Scary Stone Dragon seems easier to navigate.Both have great Scooby images, voice-overs, and some great lines. Both seem to follow the Scooby ""canon"". One glaring blunder in Jinx is when Daphne says ""Looks like we have a mystery to solve"" - that's Fred's line!A good time for Scooby fans young and old. I'm in the old category."
3,Okay CD,"Another reviewer trashed this CD, but I don't expect every song to be a favorite. Some songs were great, others okay, and others not. Overall, it was fine. I can say I liked most ofthe instrumentals, but some of the vocals didn't meet expectations."
5,Best of the Best,"If your looking for a very good Traditional Greek music CD, this is it. It's not the modern techno style...just really good Greek music & a lot of it. It's a double disc package."
3,Fits my pegpergo,I have a Pegpego stroller. This cupholder is perfect. My stoller folds the say way it did without this cup holder.. Im very happy that I got it..
5,Everyone else isn't using it right!,"You can't just throw the attachment anywhere onto the stroller you feel like putting it, and expect it to work perfectly! It takes a bit of trial and error to get any type of after-market accessory to attach to a stroller...and guess what?? They're not all going to work on every stroller! Also, many stroller makers are purposely making their strollers now so that there isn't anywhere to attach these items, because of the potential for accidents or injuries. Peg made their tubing oval shaped for that exact reason: LIABILITY. And that's also why most upper-price-range good quality stroller makers don't include a snack tray or a cupholder; they don't want to be held responsible if some yuppie mommy spills her frappucino on her baby. Use your brainds, mamas."
4,Made my life easier!,"When I puchased my Chicco Caddy, I thought it was great except... no cup holder, snack cups, storage etc. This solved my problem. I will admit it took some trials to get the clips in the right places so that my stroller would still fold, however, now we have a cup holder and the snack cup up front for dd and a cup holder in back for me. Add in the mesh bag and we are set for anything. Just be patient while installing. Once they are on you will love them!"
2,No good with Maclaren Techno stroller,"We bought a Maclaren Techno stroller which is great except that it lacks a cupholder, so we tried a cupholder-only version of this product from the Babies R Us retail store. Unfortunately the clamp that attaches the accessory to the stroller is too large, preventing the stroller from being closed. Also, the clamp needs to be pretty permanently attached, so we can't just remove it to fold the stroller."
1,Total waste of money,"Both of the clamps in this set were stripped and the bolt would not hold them in place. When we did get one to somewhat stay on my stroller, we placed an empty sippy cup in the cup holder and it both tipped over and the clamp spun around and hung upside down. The entire system seems to be made of cheap plastic and the S hooks also seem useless."
3,missing parts - would have been ok though,"last to arrive among other orders (about a week later) and did NOT come with its nuts (the bolts were there, too many actually) so i cant attach the system. all items arrived sealed so this is a factory problem. And it even displays ""made in USA"" very prominently. Please do NOT say made in USA unless you can assure quality and completeness of your product. Otherwise more people will understand why there is such a thing as ""outsourcing"". *sigh*"
4,A bretty good product,This is a very good product my wife and I have been trying to find somthine like this for months and we were very happy with this purches. We love how it is very fexable you an interchange the parts as you wish. The only thing that would make it any better is a lock so the kids can't take the attachments off
1,Don't Waste Your Money On This,This is a very poor quality item. It doesn't work on my stroller (Maclaren) because it gets in the way when you close the stroller. You have to tighten the clamps onto the stroller and then they can't be moved. It wouldn't even work on my old full size Graco stroller. The 'S' hooks that were a bonus in my set are useless and the 'bonus' mesh bag is too small to get any good use out of it.A waste of money unless you can find it at the dollar store!
2,does not work on a Zippy by englesina,It is a great concept and I will try it on my other strolle. It does not work with my englesina as I have to remove it each time a fold the stroller. The cup holder works well when it is in place.
1,Won't fit the McLaren and hard to assemble,It took me 30 minutes to figure out exactly how to hold the screws and gadget together to get it on and then I couldn't close my stroller correctly. It is NOT worth the money!!!!!!!!!
3,LF Lisboa,"Just for die hard fans of Walter Horton. If you don't know his work, don't start from here. If you have almost all of his recordings, than you could get this."
4,"Relive the excitement of ""Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All Out Attack""","The terrific playset is based on the movie ""Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All Out Attack"". This is my daughter's favourite movie, so she has hours of fun re-enacting the monster battles from the movie right on our livingroom floor! Ghidorah has even been known to sneak out and play with Barbie and My Little Pony--but don't tell Godzilla!!!"
3,Fine but not that compelling,It didn't really hold my son's interest though he was very excited seeing it in a store.
4,Expected it to be a little bigger but my son likes it,I thought there would be a little more to this but my son loves it so that's all that matters!
3,"Great fun for your little godzilla fan, but...","My son is the BIGGEST Godzilla fan I have ever met. When we saw this toy on amazon we HAD to buy it. Opening the box, we realized that the sets ""ground"" was made of thin cardboard, and only 2 buildings in the set ""crumble."" the godzilla toys are great, and its all the characters and styles of ""Godzilla: Giant monsters all out attack."" At the time of purchase the toy set was approximately $50. When we first saw it the price was close to $30. At $30 I would have been only mildly disappointed with it. At 50, I was bummed at the quality. I thank god I purchased it when I did, however, as the day it arrived I found one that was being sold on another site, ""a STEAL at $189.00!!"" if it costs more than $50, go buy your kid a videogame. ""godzilla: unleashed"" is only 10 buckks more..."
3,Read the license agreement below,Why arent't we informed of this before purchasing this item?License Agreement: (I read this when I was installing it)2 TERM The license shall remain in effect for between fifteen and twenty four months from the release date of the Product... AN AUTOMATIC SHUTDOWN DEVICE SHALL RENDER THE PRODUCT INOPERABLE AFTER THE TERM EXPIRES.Will this comment be posted? I am going to check back here in a week to check?
1,A better alternative,"I am a clinical psychologist and need some drug info.The PDR is a perfect example of the difference between data and information and its publisher's high handedness is to be expected when it teams with M$.I just bought and love the Mosby 2004 Drug Guide. Better paper, easier to read, more usable info, and only $30. It is not completely 2004 (none are really current) and the index to brand names has a few omissions but these are minor problems."
2,Kind of like paying for one volume of the LA phone book...,"The PDR is basically a bloated collection of current-patent drug inserts printed on cheap newsprint. It weighs a ton, and contains virtually no information that one can't download from the relevant drug company's website for free.If you are a doctor, you probably get this book for free. That's about what it's worth, considering that its scope is limited to expensive non-generic drugs.If you have fifty bucks to spend on a drug reference, get something complete and useable like the ""Physician's Drug Handbook."" If you want full prescribing info for a current drug, you can get it off the internet without worrying about out-of-date info or expired CD's."
4,The Hot Rock,"Having caught up with author Donald Westlake and his various genres, I found this one, based on the Dortmunder character, immensely to my liking. It is a humourous 'mystery story'. Great fun! I will be looking for the next in the series when I work through all my other recent Amzon purchases. I'm also aware that there is a new (?) one recently published. Not really sure about this new aspect as I'm aware that Westlake died."
3,Fast and funny read,"My favorite Weslake book. Persistence gets you somewhere, but not always a happy ending. Good NYC atmosphere. Interesting characters that most people would like. And yes, funny.Past TwilightR Hemingway"
5,I'm glad they made a movie out of this with REDFORD as,"John Archibald Dortmunder. Perfect casting.I read this book so many times, I know it by heart.And I agree wholeheartedly with an earlier review by A. G. Ryder. I'd hate to check out of this mortal coil early, just in case Westlake has another Dortmunder novel going to press. It would be unbearable to miss that wit, those characters, those unbelievable blunders.I don't know how Westake does it, but just keep doing it Donald."
4,Hot Rock is a cool caper story,"Donald Westlake has been one of my favorite authors for many years. I bought the Hot Rock bookbecause I remembered it as one of the first caper novels I ever read, and wanted to read it again. It was stillfunny and I love his characters! And the price was very reasonable.Again, I enjoyed this on my Kindle and will probably purchase other Westlake books that are offered."
4,"40% zinc oxide alternative to Desitin, but with petrolatum, mineral oil, parabens","I thought we were stuck with stinky, fish-oil and talc-containing Desitin if we wanted 40% zinc oxide in a diaper cream. Then I found this stuff! It works just as well as Desitin for us, perhaps better, and it smells nice (to us -- some people don't like the scent). While it doesn't contain fish oil or talc, it does, however, contain petrolatum, mineral oil, and parabens -- which some people do not like. We love it, however. It's also quite affordable -- a large tub can be found for under $7, generally. There's not much else to say -- it's a nice thick, effective diaper cream. I recommend it if you want 40% zinc oxide and you're comfortable with the ""inactive"" ingredients of ""Petrolatum , Fresh Goat's Milk , Mineral Oil , Paraffinum Liquidum , Emulsifying Wax NF , Fragrance , Beeswax , Propylene Glycol , Diazolidinyl Urea , Methylparaben , Propylparaben."""
4,Nice scent - easy to apply/remove - works!,"I have used A&D; with zinc on all three of my children, the youngest of whom is now 10 months old. I could no longer find it in stores, so I tried this through Amazon.comVery impressed! Pleasant, mild scent (resembles Noxema), excellent rash protection, thick but not gooey, easy to remove. More affordable than A&D; or Desitin ($3.99 for 4 oz) My new standby!"
2,don't like the smell,"This cream is very rich, so it is probably very good for dry or dehydrated skin, but I really dislike the smell, so I never used it. It smells a bit like baby powder, but it is not a fresh and clean smell."
5,Very Nice Product,"I've used this ointment since my son was born. I chose it because of excellent reviews it received on another Web site. It's only very lightly fragranced, which is important to us...we still don't use soaps or shampoos on our son and he's six months old now.We use the ointment at every change, and our son has never had diaper rash of any significance. Any redness disappears overnight with an extra application."
5,great stuff!,"This stuff is wonderful! It is the ONLY cream that will get rid of my kids' diaper rash. I have tried almost everything else, and this stuff works in one day. It is amazing- beats anything you can buy at the store hands down. Buy it!"
4,Are you Feelin' her yet?,"This is the first that I have heard of Kim Sozzi, and I think this song is pretty cool. Though, I had to listen to it a few times before I really got into it. It has lyrics that are really strong, tight breakdowns/buildups, and a driving beat. Kim sounds slightly similar to Amber (""Li Da Di"") or Jennifer Lopez (""Waiting for 2night""). Both of those songs are slighty better than this one, which is why I gave it 4 of 5 stars. You get 4 remixes on this single, all of which are impressive. My favorites are the ""Orchestral Trance"" mixes. I would recommend listening to it a couple times before you buy it to get a vibe on it, and to help on your buying decision. If my review was helpful to you, then don't forget to vote. THANKS!"
4,Hope there's more to come !!,"It definately is a small world... I went to elementary school with Kim Sozzi and up through high school -- she played flute in the band!! After hearing the song on the radio stations, it was quite a shock to find out it was her....She is very talented and her sound is unique and catchy... Buy it if you are in the mood for some refreshing talent as opposed to the franchised sounds these days.... I hope there is more to come from her because I think she could give some big names a run for their money !!!!"
5,Good Stuff,"As any fan of Sozzi would know by now, the new release is fun, catchy, and great to listen to. Worth while!"
4,Nice...,"For some reason I was just exspecting more then what went down. I enjoyed this novel and I will no doubt purchase part 2, and in doing that I hope the story line is greater and more thugged out as far as Ice is concerned. He started out like he had his game all tight...then after doing that bid he lost all that knowledge..it's like falling in love with a fake. Give me that thug in the very beginning and keep him that way."
4,Ice Cream for Freaks,"When I first met the author, Dejon, he was hustling his book at Target parking lot in Brooklyn. After talking to him for a bit, I was reluctant. At first the title threw me off, I orginally thought ""Another freaky street ghetto tale?"", but I bought the book.To my surprise the book is nothing like it's title. I must say it was a page turner! The whole situation with Ice in jail was something else. I mean we hear the stories about what goes on, but Dejon puts it in details! WOW!After reading the book, I relized that whatever evil one does will always come back to bit you on your a**! Dejon, Good job on your first novel!When I am ready to buy your next novel I hope to see it in the bookstore, if not I am always in Target on Sundays!"
5,Badd!!!!!!!!!!,"Man, Let me tell you that you must get that book. It's all that and then some from the front to back. DeJon did the the dayum thing fo'real need to cop that you won't be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!! Dejon thanQ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Don't buy this !!!!!! you will be disappointed,"I'm very disappointed in microsoft. This version of streets & trips gives wrong street address locations & latitude,longitude positioning."
1,Horrible Interface - Better off with Delorme Street Atlas,What is it with Microsoft and their interfaces - do they always have to cram all the crap they can into an interface so that it becomes unuseable. Especially in a GPS software you want minimal things interfering with what it is supposed to do best. Just show me the route and get out of the way! No - MSSST keeps trying to give every piece of infromation on the window - there is no way to close off all the extraneous information. Entering a new address requires two hands!! No direct way to automatically recalculate from the current GPS location.Delorme Street Atlas has a better interface but still I felt the best interface was with the Mac Version of Street Atlas 2001 - after which Delorme discontinued it. However on the Windows side - dont even bother with this MS crap.
1,Waste of Money,Don't waste your money buying this product. You are better off using the free maps online.
3,Not Competetion for Standalone Units,"As many people have discussed here what this product does do it does it very well. It's fast and can find locations and move around zooming in and out well. What it doesnt do is follow the route when using a GPS and give directions. It would be AMAZINGLY simple for it to tell you to turn on street X in 50 feet as competing standalone GPS units like the Garmin Streetpilot do. So, while it's definately a portable mapquest it's GPS abilities are barely better than it would be without a GPS."
1,Looks like Microsoft is trying to force customers away,"The incredible number of errors in the maps and navigation instructions remain after several years of this software's existence. My neighborhood was developed in the 1980s, and this software still thinks there are intersections where there are none! The funny thing about this is the maps were created well AFTER the streets were added, so one can only guess where Microsoft (or its 3rd-party map supplier) got its information from. My guess: the map software was developed somewhere other than domestically.Bottom line: Don't waste your money on this. There is a reason it is as inexpensive as it is."
3,Try it out first: the reviews are so confusing.,I have been waiting to upgrade for a while(I currently have 2001 edition and VERY happy with it). But the reviews (some very positive and some very negative) have me confused.So I went to check the Microsoft site and guess what!!!You can try it out for free for 30 days.So I just installed the trial version to see for myself how good it is. Will keep you posted.
4,Comentarios sobre MS Streets and Trips 2005,"Es un buen software que hace más sencilla la busqueda de direcciones en USA, así como también de comercios, bancos, aeropuertos... genera rutas y trayectos y me parece bueno."
5,One of the best!,"Simply this is one of the best software programs ever. If you learn how to use it properly, you will never use a printed map again (unless you print it using MS S&T). I had 2003, 2004 and now 2005 versions. This is the ultimate travelers, ultimate map program."
1,Don't waste your money,The program doesn't even do routing on a Pocket PC. You can't do it by exporting from windows or using pocket streets. What is the point of this program then? It shows you where you are and it will show the destination but you have to figure it out on your own how to get there. If you are using it on a laptop it is ok because it will do routing but don't bother if you plan on using it on a PDA. I returned it and bought iGuideance.
5,MS Streets & Trips 2005,"I love the product but am very disappointed with Microsoft and growing more and more discouraged with many of that products the carry a mail-in rebate. In this case, MS would not provide me with the rebate because I didn't send in a proof of purchase bar code, which was never explained to me in the rebate literature. I sent everything else I could think of and then threw away the box thinking that I would have been contacted by now if there was a problem. Not true - just the other day, they sent me the letter that I was not eligible. Needless to say, I'm not happy. I was also the owner of an earlier version and probably could have qualified for an upgrade."
2,Microsoft Streets and Trips Problems,"How can I get my money back? Inaccuracies galore. I am a telecommunications tech in Lubbock, TX. I only use Streets and Trips to map out all of my stops I need to make. It allows me to take the most direct route and save time.The first problem I found is that new streets in new parts of the city that are up to 3 years old are not even shown in the maps.The second problem I found is that the map program can't even correctly find addresses on main streets. It leaves out whole blocks worth of addresses. For example 50th ST in Lubbock is a main street in Lubbock. The hundred blocks are off by a full city block and at about Slide Rd it skips from 5000 on one side of the street to 5200 on the other.The funny part is that the problem didn't exist in the 2003 version. I wouldn't recommend you buy this product unless you like much frustration.."
1,Vaporware,"I bought this because it was supposedly an upgrade. It has the same old routes for the Eastern US as my 2001 version and has yet to internet update (big feature, right?) any of the many construction projects underway here. It has misdirected us to several locations, mostly because it can't tell left from right if it has anything but a east/west - north/south grid to work with. It won't work with GPS. The refund offered by Amazon and Microsoft never appeared despite full documentation. Ripoff! Amazon, are you accountable?"
3,"Not so good, not so bad.","Although there can always be more and better map info, Streets & Trips does have a good amount of detail on the maps.Trip planning options are okay, but not great. Overall, while no-where near as good as it can be, Streets & Trips is a little better than most other similar products that I have seen."
3,Good read even for those not especially interested in the topic,"Not a bad read at all. I enjoyed the information on ancient Roman military history and warfare. The diagrams of various Roman battle formations and battles in Roman history were particularly helpful. The book was especially interesting for me, as a Soldier, to see where so many of the customs and traditions still used in many militaries today originated. Plus this has to be the coolest book I've ever been assigned to read for a class!"
5,Best $12 I've spent on any book,"This book was fantastic, Adrian Goldsworthy knows his stuff, and puts forward not just fact but his own well educated view to the reader. I would have gladly have spent double what I paid for it.It is an overview, but is still well detailed and provides information regarding the change in the Roman army (of both the soldier and unit organisation) from about 700BC until the 6th century AD, but also mentions changes in her enemies and why Rome was such an invincible force, and then an empire corroded by civil war and enemies no longer in fear of her overwhelming strength.This book was not only interesting but presented new information other than the repeated stuff I see on most documentaries."
5,Impressive,Adrian Goldsworthy managed to squeeze an impressive amount of info about the composure of the Roman warmachine from the Foundings of Rome through the Principate and eventual collapse. If you want something that will give you a taste of Roman Warefare...This is it!
4,A fine work,"Unless you are a thoroughly converse Roman Military historian, this book will not be a letdown. It is a fine survey of the Roman military! Enjoy!!!"
3,Not what I expected,"I did learn stuff about Roman warfare, but I was expecting something a little bit more detailed. Its a general review, not a deep study. Towards the end of the book it also became somewhat repetitive."
4,it does what it needs to do,"bought this tray to hold my powerblock weights. it does what it needs to do, holding my weights for easy access. This also keeps the weights from damaging my hard wood floor, and makes switching the amount of weight easier. Overall a good purchase."
3,"A slightly useful tray for Powerblocks, with one little annoyance","What this trey does is simply hold the Powerblocks at a more convenient angle when moving Powerblocks in and out. My little complaint is the right and left side lips make it difficult to pin the last plate on (at least for the 50 lb. Powerblocks). Aside from that, it seems a bit pricey for a piece of painted metal."
4,Equal or Better Than Here I am To Worship 2,"Billed as the premier collection of new worship songs, this 2 disc CD set defintely lives up to that worthy title. With tracks from Newsboys, Starfield, David Crowder Band, Jeremy Camp, Kutless, Tree63, Chris Tomlin, Matt Redman, Tim Hughes (reigning modern worship song writer), and even Switchfoot this set comes alive with familiar and new praise and worship titles.So brights spots include:Filled With Your Glory - StarfieldNo One Like You - David Crowder BandBlessed Be Your Name - Tree63Better Is One Day - KutlessRain Down - Delirious?Take My Life - Chris Tomlinand many more!Not every song is an instant hit, but they all grow on you as you reflect on the words. This is a great collection with some newer artists really showing off their passion for God. Not perfect but very good. Most defintely a worthy investment for my $13.99."
5,Great family relations insights on every page,"The subject matter here is ideal for writers. By definition, every relationship having a step-someone in it came about following death or divorce in the family -- so the universal themes of personal loss and renewal provide the overarching themes of each one of these pithy 7-to-10-page essays, which immerse us in the most profound of human struggles. I could have read dozens more of these stories of sundered and resurrected family ties, and fervently hope the editor will bring out a supplemental volume every year."
3,This book worries me ...,"I have to tell you, I read a lot of BL fiction, and this is by FAR the most disturbing of the lot. I cannot quite work out whether this is a good thing or not. In many ways, it is utterly disgusting, but I suspect that quite a lot of McNeil's readers will expect and love it for exactly this reason.The writing is not bad, although I think it's the weakest of the (otherwise great) Ultramarines novels."
3,The weakest chain in his Ultramarines trilogy,"I enjoyed the 1st 2 in his trilogy but this third novelwas a slow starter and was boring during the first half.There really was no character development and wasalmost entirely action-oriented.I actually got bored and stopped reading less than halfwaythrough the novel and didn't get back to it until a monthlater when i forced myself to finish it. The novel was muchfaster paced in the later half and i managed to finish therest in one reading.If you liked McNeil's ""Storm of Iron"" then you will probablyenjoy this novel as the styles seemed very similar.As someone else has mentioned, ""I have read better"", especiallyfrom McNeil."
2,Poorly written and contrived,"This book is weak. The only thing it does well is show how idiotically stagnant the Ultramarines are in their ways. The portrayal of action is gory enough, but also very simplistic. The author also occassionally forgets what he had written only a few pages ago, and reverses himself, which comes off very comical (i.e. a character's armour may be stripped and cut into pieces, and a few pages later it is back - that, or he's challenging the hordes of Chaos clad only in a loincloth)..."
3,Poor shipping,"I bought this product over two months ago, and i still have not gotten it.If your going to get this product get two day shippingThe book was awsome though :)"
5,Simple Solution,"Simple, Inexpensive Solution to a common problem--how to keep the trash bag upright and open while you are filling it, especially if you are working by yourself. An additional bonus, the plastic protects the bag from punctures as you compress the material from time to time. Save the shipping box for storing the bagger conveniently."
5,What to give the girl who loves raking her yard...,"lol, this was another Christmas present to my wife (before we married), kind of a joke gift, but she was ALWAYS out front raking her lawn (pine straw and sweet gum balls, yuk) every time I would visit, and watching her struggle with those lawn bags got me thinking.... NOW, this is probably the MOST practical gift EVER, as it us used constantly... roll it up, drop it in the bag, let it go.... it expands, holds the bag wide open to make it easy to drop in whatever you raked up, when it's full, slide it out, tie the bag, do it again.... and rolls up for easy storage... best 10 bucks for lawn care I ever spent!"
5,I use this along with my Gator Grabber. They're a match set I use frequently,Buy it. Works excellent. Makes gathering leaves so easy. Wouldn't want to be without one. Neighborshave used it and went online at amazon and ordered it.
5,Product worked as advertised,"I ordered this Easy Bagger not knowing that Hurricane Sandy would be leaving a mess in my yard. Having this product made it super easy to pick up the debris, especially the broken branches. It's a large sheet of sturdy plastic that you roll out to fit into your trash bag. The beauty of this product is that I can put a lot of small branches inside and not have them puncture the bag. (When I take out the sheet, however, some branches did stick out, but not as much as before.) There's small opening on top for you to pull it out when the bag is full. It's 28 inches tall. One reviewer suggested using the box it came in to store after use, but I had a hard time rolling it back to size. In the end, I just used a very large rubber band to hold it together and left it standing in my garage (or you can use a large binder clip also). It's affordable and it's effective. A product that my made my life easier - I like that. Highly recommended!"
3,Not as expected,"I expected a cylinder that could be doubled, then would spring open inside the trash bag. What I received is a long, slippery and unwieldy piece of plastic that must be rolled up in the opposite direction from how it wants to roll so it will expand inside the trash bag to hold it open. When this is done correctly, it does hold the bag open and therefore is useful at its intended purpose, but the cylinder that is formed inside the bag is not perfect, as the outer end of the plastic still wants to curl the other way. The bag keeps it from doing that, but doesn't have the strength to hold it in a completely round shape. While this item is effective at holding a bag open, it is more awkward to handle than I expected and not terribly easy to get into the plastic bag. It'll get used, but I'm not completely satisfied."
4,Protects Against Bag Puctures,"This is great for protecting bags with little tear-resistance from punctures by small sticks and limbs. In my work I consume hundreds of trash bags/can liners per year. I bag up grass clippings, leaves and yard debri. Without a bag insert such as the Easy Bagger, the inexpensive bags I use (which have relatively little tear-resistance) are easily torn and rendered useless by small sticks and limbs. This bag insert completely eliminates this problem.I use a couple of plastic clamps to clamp the top ends of the liner together and the top of the bag to the top of the liner. This helps to prevent the Easy Bagger from collapsing and falling in on itself.Use of a can liner such as the Easy Bagger allows the top of a bag to be opened up to maximum size, making it relatively easy to empty the contents of a lawn mower's grass catcher into the bag."
2,Worked well at first,"It's a great concept. When I first used it to hold open my lawn bags for the clippings from my lawn tractor's bins, it worked just as advertised. However, after repeated uses, the plastic just didn't want to spring out enough to really hold the bag open. During one yard job, where I needed to fill 9 large bags with grass clippings, the plastic just went limp after about 5 bags were filled, no matter which way I rolled (or counter-rolled) it. When I can keep it rolled up for a few days, it works well again the next time, as long as I don't have too many bags to fill, but I can't count on it to work consistently. I am now looking for something like a simple frame that will keep the bag open no matter how many bags I need to fill."
3,o.k. product,We had trouble getting this product to function properly. The idea is great. The product not so much.
5,A Great Invention,"The Easy Bagger is one of the best inventions of all times! Particularly if you are a gardener as I am and your plastic rubbish bag stands up straight in the Easy Bagger for putting your weeds, grass etc. into instead of needing about four hands to fill a floppy plastic bag!One major crib about ordering on line - as I live in Ireland I was caught for tax and that tax was also charged on the shipping. I ordered three Easy Baggers, one for me and one for each of my daughters and I was willing to pay the cost of the shipping which was Euro40.35 plus the 3 Baggers were Euro23.45 which totals Euro63.80 and I had to pay Euro45.00 in tax which means each Bagger cost me Euro36.27 which is a lot of money for what should have been a great item at a very reasonable price. I have a Easy Bagger similar to this one which I have for about ten years which cost about 3 but as it is so fantastic I suppose I will have to suffer that awful extra cost!!!"
5,A Great Deal for the Money!,This is a very handy little heater. We have several of these for use in rooms that don't seem to get as warm as the others in our house. Rather than turn up the heat and overheat the rest of the house we use these plug-in heaters to make those rooms comfortable at a considerable savings on our electic bill. One thing that is espcially nice is the fact that they are off the floor and in no danger of being knocked over accidentally. We also like the appearance much better than that of a regular portable heater; no cord hanging down looking so messy and temporary. Others like it as well; guests who have stayed with us have left with information on how to purchase one for themselves!
3,Great heater for augmenting heat in bath . . .,"I've had this model for years. Only problem I've had is that the thermostat control went bad. So I'm ordering a new one. Its terrific for augmenting heat in a bath (away from water, of course) on chlly mornings in fall when you really don't want to turn heat on for the whole house, but want to feel warm stepping out from the shower. Its wall-hugger feature is especially nice. This is the 4th home I've used it in, and I had an outlet placed especially for it."
1,Great for arson,"This is a great little heater if your planning an act of arson. There isn't an insurance investigator in the world that would not believe that this started the fire, and that you were just the poor, dum shmuck that bought it and plugged it in. But, don't use accelerants because then you'll get caught."
3,Not at all bad,"Balls is much better than most of Sparks' 1980s work but not quite as gripping as their fabulous 1970s glory days, nor quite as memorable as Lil Beethoven that was to follow.The album holds together pretty well as a whole, but lacks any really memorable standout track.The cover has to be one of the most uninspired ever (though not as gruesome as those air-brushed portraits on Introducing Sparks)"
1,Major Disappointment,"I am sorry to say this was a waste of time and money. I have been a Sparks fan since the 70's and had hoped that BALLS would show that the brothers Mael could still be GREAT. If this were the Sienne we would be very suave, but it is just the rain washing down the boulevard, as they would say."
4,Marvin Redpost: Why pick on him?,Marvin Redpost is a young 3rd grader who picks his nose. Everyone makes fun of him. I felt bad for him when they would call him names. My favorite part is when he comes up with the idea that he should write a survey for the class... Sure enough everyone said that they did pick their noses. I think that it is very brave of them to say yes. I like Marvin.
2,Making fun of others is not good!,"Marvin Redpost is the main character in this book. It's a story about this kid and how other kids troubled him at school. He could not stand it and the teachers thought he started it. But the person who started it kept on spreading the word and even to Marvin's best friend. But when his mom explained him, he made up a plan for next day at school. He was able to prove that all of the teachers and kids picked on him also picked their nose and everyone stopped picking on him from then on.You can read more of my reviews at http://handystudentsmaterial.blogspot.com/"
1,Tasteless. Not appropriate. Zero educational value.,We came across this book in a first-grade class book cart. It is disgusting and far from funny. I don't see the point in introducing it to our schools.
1,Doesnt look like the picture,"These lamps do not look at all like the picture above. It is ""brushed steel"" - meaning that it looks silver, NOT cherrywood. Very ugly."
5,¿ VIERAN QUE COMUN ES QUE LOS HIJOS SE SIENTAN SOLOS ?,"Los peques son seres complicados,con mucho mar de fondo.Averiguarlo es muy importante, Y ESTE LIBRO TE GUIA PARA SABER LA VERDAD Y PONER EL REMEDIO.Los niños jamás lo dicen: Ni siquiera conocen el nombre de ""Soledad ""A nosotros NOS CORRESPONDE INVESTIGARLO..."
4,Evaluation,"The text if of good quality and comprehensive, but it could be presented in a more user-friendly way............."
2,Book in two parts fails to excel at either,"This is really two books; one is on agile development. The other is on design pattern examples. Unfortunately, it fails to be really tremendous at either.The agile development part lacks much of the pragmatism of more recently published books on agility, espousing principles quite nicely, but avoiding all of the tricky issues around larger teams, products where the architecture -- as well as the product itself -- is a deliverable, etc.The design pattern examples were pretty reasonable, but there are already more comprehensive tomes available online for free. The examples provided were just large enough to obscure the reading of the patterns themsevles and inhibit browsing (unlike the GoF book, which treads that line quite nicely)."
4,Thaemlitz's Tranquilizer,"I was turned on to Thaemlitz a year ago and fell in love with his work immediately. Though this particular piece took some time to get used to, being more familiar with more recent works, I found it to be quite remarkable. It is his first full length release and probably his most listener friendly of all. It incorporates all aspects of modern electro-acoustic ambient music. This took time to grow on me but it has become one of my favorites. For any one interested in electro-acoustic music looking to build a collection, this a must have."
1,Not a Great Performer,"Not impressed. had to send these back. They only work if you are directly in front of the sending unit, very much directly in front off. If you move at all, static city."
3,Well priced infrared headphones,"These headphones maintained a decent selling price (compared to double what many of the others are) with good enough quality to warrant the wireless. There is a distinct hiss in the back ground, but that comes with the infrared so if you want perfect clarity be prepared to shell out twice the money for a better wireless set. Otherwise, price and quality make these just good enough."
3,A little disappointed,"The headset is light and has a good sound, I was surprised about how little range the wireless reciever worked in. Nice holder which also keeps it charged."
3,Poor sound,"Easy to order, Amazon is fantastic! The headphones have a range of about 12' and you have to have a clear line between the headphones and the cradle. The sound has a low volume buzzing under it. After awhile you don't notice it."
1,Not a good item by Sony.,I was very disappointed with this purchase. Device work only in close range with its base. Sound quality was very low. I returned this item after a couple of days of receiving it. Not good.
1,Bad sound quality & defective,"I thought that wireless was a great idea; but was very disseminated in this product. My biggest complaint, other then the sending unit being defective was the sound quality. The sound quality was worse than an old AM station."
4,Headset,"I find this product very good for what it was designed for.As I saw another review earlier,I agree there is a little noise coming from the headset,however it is minor if you adjust the volume and the controls accordingly.I would recommend this to anyone who wants to blast their ears like in the movie houses and not bother anyone sitting in the same room."
3,Heads set to go,"I didn't read the details close enough when I chose the product. Infrared is a unidirectional signal. Face away from the base station or walk out of the room your signal is lost. The headsets don't set cleanly on the cradle. They are a bit sloppy in the saddle. Other than that, the sound is OK; the headset is light and comfortable. You are getting what you pay for here."
2,Sony MDR-IF240RK Wireless Headphone System,"I have owned 2 other pair of Sony wireless headphones over the years. I was excited about the size and open air features of these. I was VERY disappointed in the lack of range. My other Sonys allowed me to walk out to get the paper without any appreciable loss of sound. These, however are terrible! You cannot even turn a corner without total loss of sound. I recommend you keep looking!Sony MDR-IF240RK Wireless Headphone System"
1,Does not work with Plasma TV,I purchased a set for a tube TV in the bedroom. Works great for what I wanted -- not looking for great quality but a nice boost for my wife's hard hearing. Purchased a second one for the plasma TV and it does not work there -- a small note in the manual says plasma TVs may interfere with normal operaion. Looked on the Sony web site -- no useful help. Sent them an email with specific questions -- they ignored the questions and referred me to a web page that said nothing about plasma TV operation. I am now looking for an RF unit instead of IR -- and it will not be Sony.
3,Sony TV Headphones less than perfect,"Our Sony Headphones are back with Sony now for an exchange. We tried all their helps and never could get any sound out of the left earpiece of the headphones. We followed all suggestions given on the Sony website to no avail. We finally tried the exact same Sony Headphones owned by our neighbor on our TV to see if they worked on our set. They worked perfectly, so we are certain our headphones were a defective set. The Sony people were very nice though and we will now see if the exchange product we are to receive, will solve the problem. We were still under the warranty, but they are replacing our new set with a refurbished set and we weren't very happy about that. We wanted a new set, that had been tried and found to be perfect. We are hoping to receive a perfect set soon."
3,Not as good as expected,"I got these headphones a week ago, I found that for the first week they seem to be OK, but after sometime i find that they are pretty noisy. The dead noise i get when i do not play anything,starts to increase. The manual says that this is because of some kind of interference between the receiver and the headphone, but i still get the noise if i place the receiver right in front of me.So, folks dont buy this if you wanna listen to music..use it for all other purpose other than music!Arvind"
2,better headphones elsewhere,"I've had this set for a few years and found out that price usually doesn't always equal quality. The cheap foam speaker covers fell apart within a few years and aren't sold anywhere. Recently the plug in for the r/l wires is defective and I'm only getting the left channel unless I pull the plug out a bit to get mono in both earphones.Sound quality is good when they work, but they are limited as far as angle-to-sending unit. I little to the side of the beam and no sound.For the price, I wouldn't recommend them."
2,You get what you pay for,These headphones cost about $50. The charge light is always on even when it says it is suppose to go off after such a length of time. There is a ton of static recption in the headphones because you have to turn them up. The product is being used literally less than 10 feet from the television. If you are looking for wireless headphones and you have to have them...pay for a more expensive product.
3,Works but there is a static noise,"This product serves its purpose. however, I can't use it for long periods as the static noise drives me crazy!!!"
2,Died after 1 year,"I loved these headphones. Lightweight, never had to worry about charging them. You did have to stay in line of site with them, which was a little irritating. But my pair was flawed. After a few months the right side started to short out. The problem was in the volume control. It would short out at some levels. The right earpiece died completely at about 8 months. Now a few months later, both sides have shorted out. I bought them in December 03 and now January 05 they are dead. When I contacted Sony during warranty, I was given the choice to send them away for repair (I pay shipping). Seemed to be too much work and expense to save these headphones. Too bad. I liked the design."
1,Product stopped working,"The first unit worked OK for about a month but then just stopped transmitting, if you unplugged it and plugged it back in again it would work for about 5 minutes and then stop again. Returned it for a replacement and the exact same thing happened in 2 weeks. Returned second unit for credit and will buy something else. Both units had a lot of static, even at low to moderate volume levels"
1,MR. RYAN,"THE DAY I FINALLY RECEIVED MY CORDLESS HEADPHONE,I FOUND THAT THEY SENT THE WRONG AC POWER ADAPTOR, IT HAD CIRCULAR PRONGS THAT WOULD NOT FIT IN THE OUTLETS HERE IN THE US. IT TOOK ME OVER TWO HOURS TO GET THIS STRAIGHTENED OUT FOR SONY TO AGREE TO SEND ME THE PROPER ADAPTOR. THE ADOPTER WAS OUT OF STOCK AND THEY WILL SHIP IT IN 7-10 DAYS WHEN THE GET IT IN STOCK-----WHEN EVER THAT WILL BE??????????I'M NOT SURE I WILL EVER USE AMAZON OR GYTE ENTERPRISE AGAIN AS THEIR FIX IT WAS FOR ME TO DO ALL THE LEG WORK AND WASTE MY TIME ON A $50 ITEM."
1,Not what I expected,I regret not returning these. I thought I'd use them while doing chores but the signal doesn't travel outside my bedroom. There's static even while I'm right in front of the computer and the cushioning is so bad that they are painful to wear.
2,Not worth it!!!!,"I am not able to go from one room to another with this headset. Does not work once you go pass 6 to 10 feet. About one week ago, the headset stopped working from as much as 3 feet!!!!! Didnt do it for me."
1,uncomfotable!,I am really disappointed with this product. I have always had good luck with Sony but these are uncomfotable and have about 5 ft. of range. Bad product Sony.
2,Not for use with big screen plasma tvs,"I was excited to get this product for a gift, only to discover it becomes unuseable with static when you are sitting in front of a plasma TV. It works fine with a stereo and possibly with other TV's, but not a plasma. The problem is with the IR between the headphones and the base. Maybe if your far enough away it would work, but if you want to sit in a normal viewing distance, look for something else. Also, the sound volume is somewhat limited."
3,OK for the money,"These worked fine and no problems with them. However, the hiss was annoying. You have to turn them down really low and the TV up to get rid of most of it... but it never really goes away. I will keep them as back up, but I think I will invest in a little higher quality set."
5,batt;ery availibility,My husband has had three of the sony headphones and th battery is not available . I located a place to get ot bit ot cost $20.00 and a new head phone set is only 34.00
2,Sony wireless MDR-IF 240R,"Cheap foam ear piece covers unusable withing a year's time. Over both I taped some foam with a hole cut out of the centers so they don't make my ears sore.Volume drops in one ear (both units I own) and the volume must beturned up.Line of hearing is poor and the transmitter must be pointed directly at you within a small degree arc.Short wire hook up, making positioning of sending unit a challenge.Sound and battery life between charges are good, but the unit is not worth over [...]!FM"
5,Sony Rules,"Price is right. Great headphones, very clear and comfortable.The head band could use a little cushioning, other than that awsome product.Im very happy with this purchase. Much better than other head phones I've owned.."
2,Very limited Reception,"I bought this item to move around while listening to audio. The recpetion is ok but the range is not good at all. You have to be around the transmitter where you could easily get the signals for the headphones to work. The signal is lost even if you move slightly away from the transmitter. Also, the design of the transmitter is not really great. The sensors are placed in awkward position.Overall, the headphones can be of good use if you are using it for PC, in-room audio or TV purposes with very small range."
2,A noticable hiss which is distracting for most music/movies.,"These one is just either fair or below fair condition.A noticable hiss which is distracting for most music/movies.The headphone have built-in springs which force the bar on the top of your head, making it uncomfortable for people with bigger than average head.The sound quality is average and the range is reasonable. If your expecting better quality music, this is not it! Good for watching late night television or playing games without distracting others."
2,Disappointed with the range,"I bought these headphone for my son to play video games with. He didn't like them so I tried them hooked up to the radio in the kitchen. Unfortunately, you need to be in direct line of the transmitter for these to work. If I stuck my head into the refrigerator the music would stop. I then decided to use them while working out so I wouldn't disturb anyone with the workout video. If my arm goes near my ear, again, there is no sound. The sound quality is decent, but the fact that they need to be in direct line of the transmitter makes it almost as limiting as being wired. Fortunately, I got these as a groupon deal so I didn't pay as much. I will keep them since they work ok for working out, but I wouldn't recommend them."
1,Two units have Failed,"I have tried two units and they have both failed -- no sound! Sony sent me a rebuilt replacement the first time for $22. I had to pay this charge plus shipping because I could not produce a receipt even though the unit was a gift and only 4 months old. I am getting the 2cd unit for free except for shipping because it failed after only 2 months and Sony had a record. I'll see how the third unit performs when I receive it in a few weeks, but I am not optimistic."
1,Cannot get them working,"They worked once and never again. I wonder if I am doing something wrong? They are fully charged yet when I put them on and plug the black end into the TV, all I hear is static (if I am lucky).Is there any kind soul out there willing to write me a step by step guide on what they do to get their's working? Maybe I am plugging it in wrong? The red and white things stay in teh stand, the black piece plugs into the TV - I think that is correct since it does kill the audio on the TV. But I hear nothing. Phones are on, volume is up. Should there be a red light on the stand on? It does not light up.Help. My roomate hates noise and I bought these to keep the peace otherwise I have to listen to TV on so low its not worth it!"
4,I love these headphones,I love these headphones. I just wish they were sound deadening. My wife snores and I have to turn them up so loud the drown her out that they give he a headache sometimes. The are really good as long as you are in direct sight of the transmitter. If you walk out of the room they go off.
4,TV Head phones,"I have actually bought two set of these Sony head phones. One for the living room and one for the bedroom. They have excellent sound and are very light weight. I'm very happy with them. SA, Oregon"
1,Mine died soon after the Sony warranty expired (13th month)!,"Purchased from a local Sony shop, Christmas, 2010. Worked successfully the following 13 months, then died. Sound was never that crisp, but good enough for TV dialogue. My set was the Sony MDR-IF240R Wireless Headphone System. Perhaps the model now being marketed has improved in performance (MDR-IF240RK). Worth a try, but if you do -- get the extended warranty for peace of mind."
2,Works poorly with Plasma TV's,"This wireless headphone set from Sony works poorly with plasma TV's. The infrared light signal is effected by the light frequency from a plasma TV. If the scene on the TV is dark, the sound quality is ok. If the scene on the TV is bright light (like daylight scenes) there is significant digital noise / static. Very annoying. I tested the headphones on an older style CRT and a newer LCD TV and the sound quality was very good. No static. I would definitely not recommend using this unit with plasma TV's."
4,like it,I bought it for my wife. I watch tv in bed while my wife is sleeping and she always complained about the tv noise.Now she has no problem with my watching tv in bed.
4,Sony Wireless headsets,"These wireless headsets work good once you figure out all of the in's and out's of them. When I first connected them, there was a lot of background noise. I was trying to connect them directly to my TV audio out. The output was too low to properly drive the headset amp. In addition, the TV had no way to adjust or mute the volume. When I connected them to the surround sound system head phone jack, I was able to adjust the volume level to provide is high enough input level to eliminate the back ground noise. The audio quality was good and the range was satisfactory."
4,Works Great,"Maybe I should have given it 4 stars instead of 3, It works without any problems with good sound and stereo but one issue that's irritating. Say you drop your remote on the floor as soon as you bend and reach for it those head phones are going to fall to the floor guaranteed. Its happen every time for whatever reason I go to pick something up off the floor. If these were over the ears cushion I guess this would not happen. If they fit tightly they stay on but would hurt and be uncomfortable.So I'm trying to remember to place a hand on them when bending over. I still would recommend these and would buy again.Upped it one star for working great for 1 year. Only thing is the foam covering over ear phones are starting to show there ware, should have came with some spares."
3,Adequate but not Exemplary,"The headphones perform the task, sound quality is not as good as a wired connection would be"
3,Disappointing for a Sony!,"I am a little disappointed with this one. First one had problem and was replaced under warranty, which Amazon did a FANTASTIC job of handling it. Thanks.The headset it not comfortable, there is a little static in the background in low volumes, and the volume control knob is hard to get to when I am using the headst.I thought for a Sony name brand, it be better. I give it a 5 from a 0 to 10 scale."
3,The left channel quits after 2-3 years,"I've owned three pair of these headsets. For each pair, the left channel has suddenly quit working after two-three years of daily use."
3,"Pleasantly Surprised, But Some Issues","Good reception, sound quality fine for video but not ideal for music, won't fit children or adults with small heads.I'm please with these phones. I've had no problem with reception, and the sound is good for watching movies and TV. However, the sound is too bass-heavy and treble-light to be good for music (at least classical music).They are made for people with big heads. I have a big head, and I barely expand the phones at all to wear them. For my big cranium, they're pretty comfortable. My wife has a relatively small head and she can't use them at all. I'm going to try to rig a thick cushion for the cross bar so she can wear them, but why should that be necessary? If you intend to use these for children or adults with small heads, buy something else."
4,Can't beat it for the price,Works just fine. I use it every night after my wife goes to bed and I can watch Glen Beck or a movie without disturbing her beauty rest. The comfort I rated a 3 because the set isn't made to jump around with. It's a bit rough in the fit category. I noticed you can eliminate static by turning the volume way up on your tuner and adjusting your head set volume down. Sweet rig for the price.
2,Can not use with treadmill,I bought this product so I can walk on treadmill while watching TV. But there was so much interference from the motor I had to return it. I have been using another one which kind of worn out. I guess I have to keep using it because the motor does not do anything to it.
2,Fails after a few months,"The headset worked fine at first, but over time stopped working. There is a loose connection inside somewhere because if I put it on and tap it, it starts working again. As time goes on, I have to keep ""Rapping"" it harder!"
1,Worst Sony product,"We bought these phones for my mother who visits us twice a year and is a bit hard of hearing. She uses them to watch TV for two to three hours each day. There is a lot of hiss in the sound output. I would find that very uncomfortable but it did not seem to bother her. They worked fine during her first trip for about two months. She is visiting us now and after a month, the phones are no longer working. The sound cuts out constantly and you need to keep tapping it on the sides and the sound will continue for another 5 to 10 minutes. I replaced the rechargeable battery with a regular AAA battery. That seemed to work for one day and the problem is back again. I cannot believe that Sony with its reputation would actually market such crummy products. The phones are out of warranty (warranty is only for 90 days) and I have to simply junk them. Now I will think twice before I buy a Sony product again.Sony MDR-IF240RK Wireless Headphone System"
1,Unit does not work,The headphones will not maintain the signal for more than a few minutes. The transmitter was placed 12 feet from the headphones with no other transmitters or interference in the way. Battery was fully charged; charged for 48 hours before use. I returned them for a refund. Amazon is great about accepting returns.
1,These are horrible,These headphones are horrible. The background sound is bad and they buzz continually. Our tv went on the blink and burnt out the power supply right after we plugged these in. Coincidence? I don't know but they just are not a good choice and definitely not worth your money!
4,Good product,This is a very good product for the price you cant beat it! I love the range and sound and my wife does too since now she can sleep better and I can watch my TV shows without disturbing her.
5,Great Headphones,Got these for myself as not to interrupt the wife's sleep when I'm up late watching tv. Was surprised at the quality of sound so much that I wear them most of the time now even when the wife is up. You can use this with the reg volume off or muted. My dad visited for Christmas and he's hard of hearing. He was finally able to hear the tv without turning the volume up so loud no one could stay in the room. To say the least I bought him a pair to take home with him.
2,lousy signal,"I recently purchased this headset and all I can say is 'ech'. The distance doesnt go farther then 7-10 feet and the slightest obstical infront of the signal cuts you off. I put a peice of paper between me and the transmitter and the signal just cut off. the range it broadcasts in is around a 100 degree radius in front, NOTHING can be heard to the direct sides or back of the transmitter. I just cannot believe how lousy the signal.* Lets you enjoy music while roaming around the house or yard (As long as your house IS your yard with no walls and facing directly in front of it)* System has 24-foot range and lasts up to 35 hours( More like 7-10 feet)* Simple battery recharging (Yea this is true)* High-powered ferrite magnets generate superb sound (Sound is very nice)* Weighs 6.3 ounces(bout right)All in all I am dissapointed with this device. I have used it both at home and at work with same results, lousy signal"
3,Kens phones,"After reading the reviews on these headphones, I have to agree with most of the comments. I bought them to use on my TV, so that others in the house would not be bothered by my choice of programs. The problem with hiss became apparant immediately. Turning up the source volume, eliminated the problem, but left me with a blaring tv that no one appreciated. This defeated the purpose of using the headphones in the first place.My solution was to derive the audio input to the transmitter from the TV's headphone jack. This muted the TV speaker and allowed setting up a hiss free condition on the phones. It looks like Sony could improve their impedance matching in order to get more audio out of the line output jacks. Other than that I am satisfied. The range is more than adequate and the fidelity is better than the tv speakers."
5,Wireless headphone,Loved it for my wife while I sleep. Bought it for the den also so my wife who is a little hard of hearing could hear our programs together. Referred two other ard of hearing people and they love it.
3,Beware,"The headset itself is fine. The rechargeable battery is difficult to find, and if you go through SONY for a replacement, it will cost you as much as, if not more than the headset($43.04). For a AAA battery. I did finally find a replacement for $16(better, but still...)"
2,"Functional, however poor audio quality","I bought these so I could listen to my TV at night without waking my roommate. I found that they were functional, in that I could hear what was playing, however there was a constant noise of static with everything I watched. If I wanted more volume, the volume of the static would also increase.Don't buy this if you're looking for audio quality. Buy them if you want cheap, functional wireless headphones with a bit of static.Pros: Price, ...They're Wireless, decent charge from the battery.Cons: Awful static"
1,Poor quality - do not buy,"I have bought two of these. The first lasted for nearly a year before something disconnected in the earpice which meant the sound kept cutting in and out. I threw them away and bought a new set whuch after 2 months has developed the same fault. The sound cuts out in either one or both ears. If I fiddle with the volume contol, sometimes just pushing it into the ear piece, the sound returns. Very irritating. It acts like a wire or something is making intermitant contact. I'm debating whether to order the replacement model which is actualy cheaper. Anyhow, my advice is to not buy this model.Update: I have since bought the replacement product. It is better in every way, sounds better, better made, looks better and is even cheaper. Don't waste you time with this model. Get the 245RK."
1,Horrible,"My husband gave me these earphones as an early Xmas gift. I can not begin to say how disappointed I am with this product. I would have to get up to plug them into the back of my tv set anytime I want to use them. Seeing as how I only plan to use them late at night, once my husband decides to go to sleep, that is not an option for me. Also, the receiver to the unit sits only six feet away, and yet I had a low hissing sound the entire time I tried them out, which is extremely annoying. It's the first time I've ever returned anything to Amazon, but these are definitely going back."
5,Great Headphones,"For the money I think they are great, there may be better earphones on the market but not at this price. They are comfortable, easy to use, were very well priced and have enhance my TV viewing greatly.I don't have to have the TV turned up loud to understand what people are saying and then still not always, I can now hear background sounds like they were intended and I don't disturb anyone else.I tried them at a friends house before buying and ordered a pair that day they worked so well."
3,wireless headphones,"The headphones work great for my mother who is pretty much deaf. She has to have the TV so load that noone can be in the room with her. So, these worked great!"
2,Sony Wireless Headset,"Ok for close stuff, but the range is not good, and you need direct line of sight/signal in order to use these. They aren't kidding when they give you the diagram of the signal coverage. Spend a little more - get the Sennheisers - you'll be happier in the end. I ended up replacing these with a better model within a week."
2,Review of Sony Wireless headphones,"The first headphones had to be returned to Sony because of two reasons:1. The volume was too low.2. The phones would shut themselves off for short and extended periods of time for no apparent reason--even when the battery was fully charged.Sony replaced the first pair with one that does not turn itself off, but the volume set at maximum is still quite low and not much louder than the TV itself. So it's only borderline effective. I would not recommend this headphone to friends."
4,Sound on,"This IR sound amplifying headphone set is the best I ever owned, it's easy to use with no fiddling of switches dials or adjustements other than the volume. It works great right out of the box and comes with a rechargeable battery (or you can use an alkaline battery). It has to be used in-line-of-sight of the transmitter (thus the 4 star rating). After using MHZ headphones with its static, this Infra Red model beats tham all hands down. And it's a Sony."
4,Good Piece of equipment,"Works easily right out of the box. Fits well and is comfortable to wear. The only drawback I see is the distance. If I walk out of the room I am using this in, it cuts out immediately. However, for me it works fine."
2,too much noise,"There is a constant noise. The angle of reception is not 45 degrees, as indicated in the broshure, but much less than that.Radioshack cheeper version was much-much better."
4,Not good for Gaming,You get what you pay for. It work very good for Tv show but not good for gaming purpose.
4,Sony wireless head phones,It was difficult to pick what set was the best overall. I went on name brand and price. Both were a good choice. These phones work well in front of the TV and thats all I expected. However charging them is another story. When you put them back in the cradle the charging light will not light until they are exactly on the contacts. So you may have to do a little fishing to get them to charge. Other then that they work fine.
4,good for the price,"I just got these, and I think they're fine for the price. The battery life is great, and they only use 1 AAA battery.The comfort is fine--they aren't bulky. The sound quality is fine too, except I've noticed that I have to turn the tv and the headphones up pretty high to be able to hear, but the static isn't noticeable if you fiddle with them. I would recommend these for tv watching, but not for listening to music."
1,Sent them back!,In order to get these to work at all I had to turn my amplifier up to nearly 100%. I then had to turn the volume on the headset up to the point that the hiss was annoying. I suspected that at some point someone would unplug the headphones without turning down the volume and I'd be on the market for new speakers (or hearing aids) I don't own any other cordless headphones to compare these to but these are of no use to me. Before you buy any corless headphones I recommend you take them for a test drive. I've returned these and will be looking for a better alternative.
1,Not Up To What I expected from a Sony Product,"I had to sit front and center within 10 feet of the transmitter in order to get a passable audio from my television. It was fuzzy as I moved further away.I like to watch television while on my treadmill, which makes enough noise to warrant headphones. When I got on my treadmill with these on normal sound, I was almost deafened by the interference that came through. No audio came through at all, only static and loud noises.I got the headphones for the treadmill, needless to say, I wasted my money because to return the item would cost me shipping plus restocking and don't even go there with how much it cost for me to pay for it to go over an ocean."
5,"Great idea for Grandma, too.","This was purchased by us for our 100+ year old mom who has hearing aids that work intermittently. The ear phones connect to the tv, are wireless, and allow her to listen at a million plus decibels and let us mute if necessary. Wonderful invention."
3,Works fine but...,"I like the head phones fine with one major exception. They do not work on the television when I am playing a movie, but instead give me the underlying tv station, instead of the movie. There may be a way to get rid of the television program but I have yet to find it. This makes the head set useful only about half the time. They are also large, so it is impossible to lie down with them. Otherwise, I like them a lot. I would love to hear the solution to the tv vs. recorded movie issue."
1,"horrible, just horrible","Bought this and its all crackly sounding unless I stand in one section of the room and for some reason its worse when the picture on the tv is brighter, so thats kind of a bad and worse scenario. Spend the money on a better head set."
3,wireless headphones,"Bought these headphones as a replace for same model for patient at nursing home. Found them to be very easy for him to handle. However, first set had better sound; second set had a low hum in background."
2,Missing Something,"I hade high hopes for this product but was dissapointed at the lack of power. There was too much noise even without a lot of movement. Perhaps I needed a more powerful unit, maybe ?"
2,Sony Wireless MDR-IF240RK Headphones,"Fine for watching tv 8-10 feet away. Stepping into another room 4-5 feet away...signal dies as you cross threshold. Charger is good for about 3/4 Hr before static comes through and signal fades to silence. These are not designed, nor should they be used to make or listen to computer music programs like GarageBand, as the signal is so weak, you must constantly increase the computer output signal, thus making your recording volume too ""hot"". These are more the hobbyist version, not studio-quality headphones. Price is reasonable for watching TV."
2,disappointed,I am disappointed in these headphones. I always hear static and the claimed 20 ft distance is exaggerated. I wouldn't recommend them.
2,Not a good headset,The headset only works while you are in the room with the base. It also has poor sound quality with a feedback noise that is heard most of the time. Also the headset does not always stay on your head when you are moving around.
1,Not good,I bought this Sony headset for my Sony 52 inches LCD TV and the sound quality is not great (a lot of static). Very disappointed with it. I think Sony should have a good quality standard. Honestly I am afraid to try other headset from Sony. I bought a wireless headset from Unlimited and it works very well. Almost the same price but very clear and not static.
1,JUST JUNK,"This is just a rip off. After using it 4 times, it quit working...first poor static sound & then not anything. Amazon won't refund, because it has been over 30 days, Beware this scam!!!"
3,pros and cons of Sony MDR-IF240RK Wireless Headphone,"It is light to wear, that;s nice. It is rechargeable, that's nice. However it has a fuzzy sound sometimes, a small buzzing that can be annoying."
2,Poor sound quality,"I bought this as a replacement for another pair of Sony infra-red wireless headphones that had finally gone bad, but were no longer being sold. My original headphones had awesome sound and lasted for years of daily use.The sound on these IR headphones is very poor with a lot of interference and background buzz. FYI: I prefer IR to FM wireless headphones due to higher quality of sound in general.This would be an appropriate product for young ones watching TV or videos."
4,excellent,works just fine feature of turning itself off when put back in the charger and no extra wires for convenience very nice.
1,Breakers,If you are looking for a set that will last 6 months and then break this is your set. Left speaker goes out at 6 months 2 sets same result daily use.
3,problems cutting out,great as long as nothing and I mean nothing comes between you and the transmitter. It completed cuts out when the cat walks by!
1,Laser head phone,Absolutely awful. The sound is terrible. Tried to return but the supplier never contacted me. Would like to exchange for headphones that use radio signals so I don't need direct line. I would not recommend these to anyone.
3,Decent for the price,"I wanted a set of wireless headphones for my desk at work - I got tired of nearly decapitating myself when I pull away from the desk and the headphone cord was caught on something. These do the job well. My only complaints are that at higher volume there is a hiss, and the spring-loaded headband is most annoying. The first is solvable by turning the headphones down and the player up. The second I had to resort to some crafty use of paperclips and tape to keep the headband in place."
1,Sound quality is poor and there is too much static.,"I purchased 2 of these headphones. One for myself and another as a present. The first one I opened and tried out, the static was bad. I thought maybe the one I opened was damaged. The 2nd one was just as bad on the static. I bought myself a pair for when I run on the treadmill. As soon as the treadmill turns on, the static gets so bad you can no longer hear the TV. I had to return both of them."
2,You pay for what you get,"I bought these for my husband as a Christmas present. He likes to falls asleep to the TV and I like silence. They worked great for about 6mos and then it was all downhill. Sometimes they would work, the sound might fade in and out and now they just won't work at all. Yes, I've made sure that battery was fully charged. I'm currently searching for a replacement and saw the varying degrees of pricing. At $50, they are on the cheaper end, so I supposed you get what you pay for (in comparison)."
1,headphone system,I sent this back and I am waiting for a refund. I could not get it to work. I really need to hear TV better.
4,Great sound,These headphones have great sound and the range is pretty good too. But the headphone do not cover your ear entirely so these don't have the background noise cancelling function. But for the price and the brand i would say its a very good buy.
4,"works great, relatively low price","I was a bit worried by some of the negative reviews for this product.I just got it yesterday, and so far it is excellent.Noise is fairly low. Could be dominated by noise on input as far as I know.Auto mute works when I leave the room (No IR signal)I'm not getting any loud static at all.No variations as I move about the room, until it mutes when signal is lost as I leave the room.I bought this since it mentions that it works from a line in (high impedance) notjust headphone jack (8-16 ohm impedance)It is working great in this mode.My placement is on a shelf. This may help reception since the upper IR emitterwould be pointed at the white ceiling, giving a nice reflection.The lower IR emitter might have direct line of sight."
3,"Decent sound, lousy construction","For watching TV late at night and not disturbing my spouse, this seemed like a good, low cost option from a company that I love to use. All electronics I have are Sony. The sound is decent, nothing spectacular which is what you expect for this price level. Range is good and the reception is good. Trouble is that you have to have a head the size of the hulk to have the headband fit. Big heads welcome! Another, and the most troublesome aspect is that the earphones are cushioned with a cheap foam coverlet that is removable. So easily removed that you constantly lose the silly things. Move your head, they go bye bye. I would give this four stars if not for the 10 cent cushions. Now, I'm looking for something a little better."
1,Not Happy,"I decided to go with these since they were infrared and I had hoped interference would not be an issue. Boy was I wrong. Maybe I have too much going on in back of my TV, but I couldn't get these to work without a continual hissing in the ear piece. Seller did great, but I had to return."
2,Not so happy anymore,"Have had these headphones since late Dec 2012. Nothing but problems--they cut out and don't work with digital channels on TV. Now, they worked with digital channels when I first got them, but no longer. They worked when using while watching Netflix, now only intermittently(sp). Don't know why this is happening. Using on Panasonic Viera TC-L42E50 HDTV. If any one can tell what's wrong, I would appreciate the help. My man is ready to throw out both the TV(just got it late November)and the headphones. HELP!!!!!BTW I have cable hooked up but with the programs I have I don't need a cable box. Don't know why this would make a difference since the headphones worked fine when I first got them."
3,Could be better,"Easy setup. Sound quality decent. No additional batteries required.Unfortunately, you must be in line-of-sight to receive a signal. There is a constant underlying hiss. I would look at other options before settling on these."
5,wireless earphones,This is one of my favorite products. I am hearing disabled and it is wonderful to watch tv and understand what they are saying without the neighbors having to hear it as well!
3,can't hear dvd's,"This headphone set is the NUT for watching TV...however, we can't hear any DVD's that we play?? Anyone else have this problem?? Thanks!!"
5,Love Em,"When I first hooked them up, I could only get sound out of the left channel. I got on line with live tech support and they had me check my connections. Walah, it was not plugged in all the way. Ya gotta be connected if you expect them to work. And work they do. I only use them on our main tv in the living room and I am hard of hearing so when the family is viewing, they can have the TV down at normal listening range and I can now make out clearly all the sounds by using these great headphones."
5,"MDR-IF240R, Wireless headfhone","The reason I wanted an amplifier is to get help watching TV. I have a flat TV which the sound is coming from bottom and words is not clear and I have to raise the sound which causes the people around me to complain.Previously I ordered another type of amplifier, which was picking up all the sounds around me while watching TV.So I ordered this one and it is exactly what I wanted.I can watch TV anywhere in the room. But the old TVs may not have the outlets to attach base unit. Battery is holding but I have no idea how long . We will see. It is good for older People like me watching TV."
1,Awful,"I bought these headphones for my hard-of-hearing father, who wanted to listen to TV without annoying my mother.Though the distance between my dad's chair and his TV is only about ten feet, I could hear the signal in only one of the earphones, and the hiss coming from both sides of the headset was deafening and far outweighed any audible signal from the TV. They are completely unusable for this use case.To add insult to injury, because these headphones were purchased through an Amazon partner instead of Amazon itself, I am apparently entitled to no refund.I am a big fan of Sony electronics and have two pairs of their MDR-7506 cans which I use for audio recording. I was disappointed to discover that they don't work and disgusted that I won't be able to return them."
4,Good Quality Product,I bought this product for my husband to use at night so I could sleep while he watches TV. It works great! He said the quality of the sound is very good and easy to use.
2,Hissing noise is too much,"I just brought these home from the store and tried using with my MP3 player. The sound quality is not bad, but the hissing noise is too much. I can even here it in the background during the music. These are going back in the box and back to the store. I suggest you don't waste your time with these."
2,owner,Do not use this product with a plasma TV due to the (very loud) static you will hear when any bright image appears on the TV.
4,Now Hear This!,"I always get a little excited when something works as well as it's advertised, especially when purchased, sight unseen.So it is with my Sony MDR-IF240RK Wireless Headphone System. Being a retired military person, I have a small hearing problem. (Actually, the problem lies with THOSE who don't speak clearly!)In any case, I can now watch NASCAR and other sporting events, with the volume as high as I like. If there are others in the room, they are able to listen to the speakers at any level that THEY like.The headset ""masks"" the speaker output, so the sound level that I hear is whatever volume I've set.After everyone else has retired, I don't have to turn on the amplifier to enjoy my ""privacy"", as the headset works independently. They are light, comfortable and have a wide enough range to work in most any room.Let the rest enjoy the silence...'cause I'm rockin' on baby...Warmest regards...The SARGE!"
3,Song headphones,"This is our second set we have bought.The headphones are worth the price. The sound is decent but they do have drawbacks.You have to almost be in front of the TV if using them for this purpose.Also, after a short time the ear pieces can make your ears hurt. The cup has only a thin piece of foam. Maybe with a thicker foam it wouldn't be so bad.On the whole for what we use them for, the're fine.Sony product lover."
1,Too noisy to use,The earphones did not work as well as I expected. I tried all the remedies suggested to get a clear sound but the 'white noise' continued. I finally returned the earphones for a refund.
2,tons of hiss,"The positives: light, great battery life, easy rechargingThe negatives: the hissing is very obvious unless you're listening to sounds that will drown it out. I even made sure the headphones volume was very low and that of my audio source was quite loud which helped but ever so slightly. Also, the hissing gets louder in certain spots in the living room so I would think it has to do with interference with the other equipment nearby. I have many pieces of electric equipment around the transmitter (home theater receiver, Tivo box, etc.) so that might be the problem, but realistically, those will almost always be close to the transmitter.This is ok for occasional use but don't expect it to do wonders."
4,Pleasantly surprised by the quality,"I got these for the office because I was tired of wearing my cheap headphones and getting caught up in the wire. Set up was a snap... I just plugged the cord into the speakers on my desk where the headphones used to plug in. I allowed the headphones to charge over the weekend. I came in this morning and have had them on most of the morning. The quality is pretty amazing considering the headphones are IR. I can walk out to the printer in the hallway and still listen to music. I did play with the various volume settings (speaker volume, headset volume) and I got great sound by turning the speaker volume higher and the headset volume lower. The headpiece is just a tad tight, but not so bad that I've had to remove them yet. I suppose it's better than having them slip off continually. I'm very happy with these and may purchase a set for home use."
3,Buffalo,Purchased as a present for my husband. This is one of the Sony products that we were disappointed in. The antenna needs to be located without any interference and then the sound isn't that great. Bought this based on other reviews and have been disappointed with the clarity. Not what we expected. May be returning.
3,Cordless Headphones as a necessity,"I am partially deaf, especially my left ear. I have used Sony headphones for years. I bought this to replace one with 40mm drivers which had a defect. This has only 30mm which does not cover my ears as I need, especially the left. There is no balance control on this item which I personally need as much as a volume control. In order to hear with these as I should, I need to slightly press each side against my ears. I use these by necessity because of my partial deafness. Sony needs to understand that there are people like me out there who needs these features. Otherwise, for the average person, these headphones are of excellent quality. Most people would like them."
2,Not Worth It,"This headset has a hiss, even at 7 ft away. The hiss gets worse when you have anything blocking the headphone's direct line of path from the receiver unit. I could hear the whole hiss throughout the movies.Also the comfort level is pretty low. the headset plastic bar on top of your head constantly pushes down, creating pressure and tension. The headset phones had an uncomfortable foam that made my ears hot and itchy after 10 mins of usage.Overall, it's not worth the price. I returned the product."
1,Not for Plasma TV,"Actually, I have no idea how well this product works because, contrary to anything stated in the item description, the product will not work with a Plasma TV because it uses an infrared transmission method that is incompatible with a Plasma television. Thus, I was never able to use the headphones after spending several hours attempting to get them to operate and then spending several hours on the Internet only to discover (and not from Sony, either) that they will not work with a Plasma TV. Despite this limitation not being noted in the item description, I was not refunded my nearly $12 cost of returning the item, which I did due to their failure to note the product's limitation."
2,Headphone not working well,"I bought this producto to use in Chile, SouthAmerica. A friend brought to me. Here we use 220 V, so was necesarry to buy a new transformer from 220 to 9 v. But all the time have noise, and is not posible to lisen music correctly.Jorge Reyes"
2,Sony wireless headphones,the reception is not satisfatory to our needs. We've returned the items already
3,SOny Headphones,I am semi satisfied with these headphones! Not as good as the last pair of Sony's I had! They were not as expensive but they were overrated as far as the write up goes!
4,HEAD PHONES,I LOVE THESE WIRELESS HEAD PHONES! THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THAT I COULD NEVER GET THE BATTERY TO RECHARGE. I HAVE TRIED EVERY WAY POSSIBLE TO HANG THEM UP TO CHARGE BUT IT NEVER WOULD. I JUST CHANGE THE RE-CHARGEABLE BATTERY WITH A REGULAR BATTERY AND IT WORKS FINE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM!!
4,Sony Headphones rock for TV viewing,"Product arrived as ordered. Easy enough to install the battery. Sound quality for TV is very good and we like being able to turn the TV sound down to zero and control the volume on the earphones. It is still possible to hold a conversation with the headphones on, but the phones do mute almost all the outside noise and ""purify"" the sound delivered by the phones. As long as you're in the same room as the transmitter and are facing (more or less) the unit, the product works flawlessly. Very satisfactory product and very well priced."
2,"Excellent range, terrible comfort","These phones have excellent receiving range, working through almost 180 degrees. The sound quality, while not very good is acceptable for listening to television. Battery life is very good. HOWEVER THEY ARE HIDEOUSLY UNCOMFORTABLE!!! There is no swivel whatsoever, neither vertical nor horizontal. If your head is not shaped like the SONY dummy you are out of luck. To make things worse the ear pads (not cups) are foam plastic which is an excellent insulator making them quite hot.It is so bad that I am trying to work a kludge with an old set (40 years) of Pioneer phones from my radio days."
4,Finally can hear the TV while the husband snores away.,Great product for a reasonable price. Does exactly what I need. I can watch TV in bed without disturbing anyone else in the house and I can finally hear the TV while my husband is snoring.
3,Ok but not great,"I purchased these remote headphones for TV listening to replace Sony TMR-IF540R (no longer available), where one channel stopped working. The 540R has much bigger earpieces and are much more comfortable. The 240RK has distortion when I crank volume up to where I prefer, which was not a problem with the 540R. I suspect that this is due to the fact that the 240RK uses one 1.2V rechargeable battery versus 2 in the 540R"
1,Disappointing,I was disappointed at the quality of sounds - constant buzzing sound and ended up returning the item with stocking fee plus shipping cost. Just bad experiance with the item.
2,Replacement battery,"The product works as advertised. I find it comfortable and the quality is perfect for watching television. I had no idea it required a special AAA rechargeable battery. And the cost of one AAA, $40.00, is very expensive. This information should be provided by the seller.I did find one solution provided by another owner/purchaser of the Sony MDR-IF240RK""A rather nefarious way to make you buy a $40 battery. I solved the issue by taking a toothpick, trimming it to the correct length and pushing the switch back (as the black plastic square did) and wedged it into the length of the lower corner of the battery compartment, parallel to the battery placement. There is plenty of room in the compartment and it takes about 25 seconds at most.""New-Infrared Headphones - MDRIF240RK"
2,Bad,"Specifically purchased IR to limit range. Had RF conflict with neighbor.This thing is horrible compared the superb Sennheiser RF headphones. Tinny audio, constant loud hissing.Occasional loud ""pops"".Earcups are spring loaded on the headband. They keep riding up to the top of my ears."
1,Probably the worst item I purchased from AMAZON,"This headset is a very POOR quality and probably is the worst purchase I've made from Amazon...the HISS distorts the sound of any music you listen too terribly...I used the head set on my laptop, and you have to turn the computer volume to the max to hear anything and then it is only hiss-ridden and distorted. I contacted the manufacture to seek assistance and he told me the item was defective....Amazon sent me second set (and billed me for it!!!!!) and it is as bad as the first....I urge caution if you choose to buy this item...one bad purchase and a follow up charge for a second bad unit does not make me happy....my money should be refunded and this product should be removed from Amazon, if you wish to maintain a quality reputation.Leonard Anderson"
3,Ok for kids or TV,"The product has some static to it. It's ok for listening to TV or if the kids are playing video games, it keeps it quite in the house. Also it is good if you have a DVD player in the car and the kids can listen to thier stuff without bothering the rest of the people in the car. If you are looking at using these for music, these are not the ones to get."
1,did not work,Bought this headphone last week. Plugged it in and got nothing but static. Plugged into another tv and static. it might have been a decective unit. sent it back.
2,static,"headphone was not worth the money, considering there are other headphones around the same price-this headphone is very static and will not pick up if you are more than 15 feet away, which is not far if you have a large bedroom. I would not recommend any one buy them."
5,Wireless Headphones,I received this earlier than expected and it was well worth the money. I bought it for my husband and he has used it everday. He has a love for the TV and now he hears what the ppl are truly saying. He has watched movies over and heard things he never paid attention too before. The only bad thing I can say is My husband uses it too much. Well worth the money.
3,did NOT meet our needs,"Not much to say. Wasn't absolutely horrible, but didn't meet our needs. Was a little tricky to figure out how to install it, since we have a cable box, TV and 3 different video game systems all hooked up together. We used it maybe a few times in 2 years and ended up giving them away. disappointing."
3,wireless headphones,worked well with pc and xbox. allows wireless operation without much noise imposed from transmitter. perfectly good for games.range seemed to be about 14 feet. headphone charge whilst in transmitter/holder.
3,Good for sleeping,"I bought these for my husband for Christmas as he likes to fall asleep with the TV on and i need silence (ok, maybe it was a gift to myself!). The sounds is clear and set up to TV was easy. Only reason this doesn't get a higher rating is that on occassion the signal seems to be disrupted and sounds is lost, returns momentarily."
3,"Works as advertised, no better, slightly worse","Took about an hour of playing around and tweaking to get set up to my satisfaction. Infrared xmission hiss is noticeable as stated in document. Range is ~12 feet, 45(deg) L & R from axis, again as advertised, but less than I was secretly hoping for. Fine for desktop, ok for my primary application (exercise bike, which is set up next to my desk.) I may take these to the office, though, and see if I can't find a pair of wireless headphones that would let me roam all around the house. They seem to start around $70.Sony MDR-RF970RK Wireless Stereo HeadphoneUPDATE: after owning for a year, not that thrilled with these. still takes a lot of fiddling to get good sound and wireless cuts in and out frequently. if I had to replace, I'd shop around."
4,Peace and quiet,"Got these as a Christmas gift for my husband to watch TV in bedroom. Work great; loud and clear without interference in headset; total quiet next to it. Only two minor drawbacks: 1) Have to be careful when placing in charger because the they don't snap in and if not aligned exactly the charger light does not come on and 2) because charger is next to TV you need to remember to get headset out ahead of time (ex. the night before for watching early am TV) or else get out of bed and go across room to get it. Getting it out ahead of time works fine, it stays charged."
3,These work as they should.,"Got these so I don't keep my wife awake at night as I watch tv. They are great for tv watching and they are also pretty good for gaming use, they have good sound. The IR is sensitive so the unit should be placed in a location with nothing in the path of transmitter and receiver."
2,uncomfortable headphones,These are the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever used. The cups do not pivot or swivel and there is a hard convex surface just beneath the foam covers pressing against the ear. I probably will not use them.
3,Need better quality ear pads,"Have had these for about 5 months. Battery life and performance are satisfactory for my needs. My major complaint is with the ear pads - they are cheap and thin, lack elasticity, and fall off. Some padding on the head band would also be more comfortable when wearing for an extended period."
1,Boo hiss.....,"After putting up with iCarly blaring in the living room for far too long, I decided to buy some wireless headphones for my 12 year old daughter. Imagine my surprise when I got these and the instructions say they cannot be used with a plasma tv?! There was a terrible hiss, no matter how we moved them and adjusted volume levels on both the TV and the headphones. I'm returning them for a more sophisticated pair....."
2,Not for HDTV Plasmas!,"It was hard to review the quality of these headphones because they started to buzz loudly when there was a television on in the room.Shipping was very slow. Took 10 days to get here from next state over. If you need something quick, USPS Smart Post is not a good choice.Amazon like always stands behind their products....the return process was very easy."
3,bought this just so i can watch tv at night while everyone is sleeping,works great if you only want to watch tv in silence. the range isnt that great...and the sensor has to be directly facing you in order not to have any static...its ok...not the greatest sound quality and the volume is kinda low....but hey for the price i paid it doesnt bother me. since i only use it to watch tv at night while everyone is asleep....if you looking for better sound and everything dont get this product.
4,Life altering!,I purchased these wireless headphones for my mother's television so that I could sleep at night. They work perfectly. The only complaint I have is that this is the second set I bought in slightly less than three years.
4,Very good cost-benefit.,"This porduct has a very good cost benefit, even though the range and the sound quality are not the ideal."
4,Sony headset makes for a good sleep,I had purchased the same unit for the living room approximately 1 year ago and decided to obtain a unit for the bedroom. The headset has very good sound quality. The headset must be in line sight of the base unit. The Sony unit has allowed a light sleeper many good nights rest.
2,Plasma TV incompatibility,"On the inside of the packaging was a small note saying that there was a problen with using this product with plasma TV. Why not indicate this in the product description so buyers would be informed before they purchased the product, had it delivered and spend hours trying to find out why the heasdset didn't work????"
2,Sony MDR-IF240RK,These work OK but gave it only 2 stars because I bought these and the 540 at the same time. The 540 have more features and are worth the additional money.
3,Good Product,"Works well. Needs only one battery which lasts a long time. The re-charging base needs re-design. It is difficult to place it on top of a flat panel TV.A plasma TV, which I have, produces static of an irritating, machine gun-like character. The transmitter must be FAR removed from the TV, but the cable is too short for that. Otherwise, one must have the lights of the transmitter in a direct line to the listener. There is no CONE for reception; it must be direct line."
1,Returned Merchandise,I can't have an opinion on this product. We could not get it to work on our TV system. I returned it and have already received credit.
1,sony-mrd,"this product is very poor. Quality is very important to me. Sound quality is not there at all. It works wireless, however, like I said it is poor. Sony needs to do alot better."
3,"Not bad, limited range, direct line of sight only","The headphones sound pretty good when you have clear line to transmitter and you don't exceed around 15 feet. I don;'t consider my living room area to be all that big, but I can easily go from clear to static by walking around the room. It does, hwoever, allow me to watch the morning news without waking the wife on those occasions where I get up first. One thing to bear in mind, few TV's have these audio headphone jacks these days, at least in my house. I can only use these on one TV (connected to stereo surround), was surprised to find this out about new TV's"
4,Sony wireless headphones,"The product generally works very well, however, it is very ""line of sight"" specific. If you usually sit in one location in a room you will have little static interference, but if you change locations (chair to sofa, etc.) you will have better reception if you aim the sending unit at that location in the room. The unit works with the included rechargeable battery or you can use an alkaline which will give you about 36 hours of use, per the manual. I consider this a ""plus"" as I have to move the sending unit-charging cradle in order to charge the headphones as my TV is in a cabinet and there is no for the phones to stand up in the cabinet."
1,Don't buy if you want to listen to music on a computer,I will be sending these back tomorrow. When plugged into anything but a TV all you can hear is static with some background noise of your music. If you want to use them near a computer forget it. There is too much feedback and call you can hear is static. Also the directions do not give you anyway to trouble shoot this or even address a static issue.
1,Sony MDR-IF240RK wireless headphones,"The head phones seemed to be just what the Dr, ordered. They were light, compact, easy to set up and at first worked fine. After what was probably a 1/2 hour of listening the headphones delivered a loud snap to my ears and quit transmitting. Everything seemed to be OK and after unplugging the power and turning them on again the sound returned. They repeated the ""snap and shut down again.""I returned them and Amazon sent a replacement SUPER FAST. The new set started off working perfectly and I was pleased. After about 2 hours or so of a TV program the now familiar snap returned and the sound shut off. I contacted SONY to get some information as to what was wrong which was a total waste of time. All they said was to plug it in like I hadn't done that. I had the feeling that they were aware of the problem but didn't want to admit to it. [Reminded me of GM of old. They never fixed problems either} I returned this set and ordered a different make."
1,not as good as some others,"There is a lot of background sound that reminds me of a constant wind, it gets louder when you turn up the volume but never goes away no matter how low you turn it down. The instructions say that the white noise is inherent to the system and should not be viewed as a negative. Not all wireless headphone sets have this rushing noise in the earpieces. I would not buy this brand of wireless headphones again despite the fact that usually Sony does a good job with its electronics. I own several Sony components, but it would only work well for the trully hard of hearing individual that could not pick up on the noise."
4,May have saved my marriage lol,"I recently changed my shift at work. I started working the evening shift. I started working from 3-11 PM. I would come home, and watch TV. My wife was very concerned that the TV would wake up our young son. Often times she would gently remind me to turn the volume down (as gently as only a wife can do lol).I got these headphones, and wasn't sure if they would fit with my TV. They arrived, and were super easy to install. I just plugged the cable into the TV, and they have worked perfectly ever since.My only compliant is that they don't feel as secure as I wish they did. They feel a little bit flimsy, but they've been used about 5 days a week for 6 months now, and they have worked perfectly."
4,Really useful gadget.,Ok i love this thing. I'm actually at a point where I'm not watching TV without it. Its nice to watch TV and not disturb anyone. Its an excellent product that sounds great and gives me awesome stereo sound.
3,Good but don't drop it.,I have bought 4 over the years of the Sony MDR IF240RK. It was convenient because I could put the base in 2 rooms and walk from room to room and continue listening on 2 tv's. I was upset when one of the head sets hit the floor and the right side stopped working. The other headset developed a glitch in the volume wheel so that I had to play with it to get the left ear working. A little annoying. The convenience and at the time I caught in on sale and bought 2 more to replace the first 2. I was very careful not to drop them but it didn't matter to the volume wheel which developed a glitch in both units. I just dropped the 4th one and now have to consider my options. Also the foam pads were cheap and I had to replace them several times. Overall worked very good when it worked but product quality and longevity were lacking.
3,ok but not great,"been using infrared headsets for about 15 years now, this is my 3rd set. they do tend to have a long life span. the last ones i had and still have are also Sony but better quality (the strap finally cracked and is patched). this technology (infrared) has an inherit hissing sound to it, this set has a considerable louder hissing sound which is suppressed by not using them at max headset volume; you'll get used to the hissing in a short time. the quality of this set is very light which makes it comfortable for long listening time but not suitable for rough handling, i.e. keep away from kids. i gave it 3 stars because i expect Sony to make things more sturdy and because they were not exactly cheep. btw you can use multiple headsets with one base."
1,Not as advertised,"I usually trust Sony products, but the range on this is decieving. It says MAXIMUM 24ft when in actuallity it averages 3-6 in the same room with about 2ft of good sound quality. Returning. Warning: do not buy."
1,Dissapointing,"I thought the product was dissapointing. Sure, I recognize that it is a IR headphone, i.e. it won't work if there is an obstruction in the path of the signal, but even without any obstacle, it has a lot of noise and interference unless you are very very close to the transmitter. But if you are that close, you might as well use a head-phone with a cord. I'm not happy with the product at all and I would return it if I could; so my recommendation is to think twice before buying."
1,Very Disappointed - Terrible Product,This product did not work at all and the return policy is such that once the product is removed from the box it cannot be returned. The only option is to send to a Sony service center for repair. This is not a cost effective option and is extemely disappointing. Etronics is not a a consumer friendly company to deal with having no weekend customer service hours!
2,not great,"i liked the lightweight design of the headphones and the simplicity of the whole system. but i have to disagree with the description about other statistics.- i only got about 12 feet of range. meaning i could be in the same room and could not get reception.- the headphones only worked within a very small angle. not 90 degrees as advertised. i could hear fine in the middle of the couch facing the stereo, but move to the end and i got nothing.- when someone got between me and the antenna, the music would cut out.the price was right and i'm sure these are fine if you are sitting directly in front of your stereo or tv without moving and making sure no one walks in front of you. but that's not what i wanted."
4,Decent wireless headphones,"The adjustment for head size/shape is a little funny, and the earmuffs are not that comfortable. But the sound is good, with only a little bit of fuzz. The range is good, and the set picks the signal right back up when coming back after disconnection. In all, a good buy for the price."
1,be wary of this product,"If you want to listen to a lot of hissing and popping, this is the product for you.This is the third wireless headset I have purchased. This has to be the worst productI have purchased. Don't believe the 20 foot range, ten feet is more like it."
4,Works Great. The Best Go-to-Sleep Inventions,"If you like to fall asleep watching TV but your spouse doesn't, this is a 'marriage saver'. It provides high-quality sound and the recharger allows me to use it for many many years. The only bad thing I can say about it is that you can sleep on it as the hard-plastic of the headphones are uncomfortable. If they made it softer, you would not want to take them off."
4,Works as advertised,"Static is noticeable, but not too distracting. Useful for a bedroom environment, where you will not be moving around much after putting it on."
5,sony headphones,"i have a slight hearing problem and i saw these and ordered them, they were not expensive and are a good quality and i can watch tv with the volume down so doesn't bother others in room"
4,Background Hiss,"I love these headphones. For the price I paid, they perform very well. NOTE: YOU MUST TURN OFF THE SPEAKERS BUILT INTO YOUR TV, TURN THE VOLUME OF YOUR TV SET TO ALMOST MAXIMUM, AND THEN TURN THE HEADPHONES ON AND ADJUST THE LISTENING VOLUME WITH THE VOLUME CONTROL WHEEL BUILT INTO THE RIGHT EARPHONE. IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE ABOVE PROCEEDURE YOU WILL BE ANNOYED BY BACKGROUND HISS. I've owned two pair of these Sony MDR-IF240RK headphones for over a year (with no problems) and I just bought two more pairs for my in-laws. After proper installation and operation, My in-laws love them too."
3,Haadphones for TV,"These headphones are definitely not hi-fi product, but they are pretty good for using with TV. Hissing on low volume prevents it from using while enjoying music, but they are really convenient to get rid of wire hell around the TV set. In fact I did not find any wireless headphone (whether IR or RF) in this price range, which lacked hissing.Thus summing we have:Pros:* Clear space around the TV. No wires around.Cons:* Hissing on low volume.* Convenient for TV only, whenever output is comparably high to cover the hissing."
2,Not for use on Some Treadmills,"I bought these headphones to watch TV while on the treadmill. They don't work at all for that purpose. Interference from the motor causes them to cut-out. They work great when I stop the treadmill.Update: I upgraded my treadmill to a NordicTrack S3000. These wireless headphones work great with it. No interference problems. So, I would upgrade my rating if that were possible.Just be aware that they may not work with some treadmills because of interference."
1,Not worth it.,I was surprised that Sony of all names has this poor product. I would only be able to use them for a few minutes befor distortion would start then get worse then the headphones would just shut off from it. I was not moving and I was at most 3 or 4 feet from my tv and closer on other attempts to get it to work. There was no blockage between me and the transmitter and my tv and cable have no static noise without the headphones. Its worth spending more on a better qaulity headphones if you want quality.
3,For casual use like tv...not for music lovers,"I use these headphones primarily for computer use. Just because it's infrared doesn't mean it's free from background static noise. If your intent is to listen to music, then I'd steer clear of these. There is still a slight hiss, no matter how close you are...at which point you'll ask why you even bought a wireless.The construction is not all bad, but you can tell why this thing is inexpensive. The ear muffs feel rather cheap and get uncomfortable in a short time. Then there is this annoying metal twang that you hear as it settles on your head. I kept wondering what it was until I realized that was something internal with the headphone's structure.In sum: get only if you can't afford anything else and really must have a wireless. This is bottom of the barrel stuff...hence the low price. But hey, it does work, although the tuning quality isn't great. Good for non-serious use like watching tv, but not for listening to music."
3,"Ok for TV sound, not for music; get something cheaper","I guess no matter what wireless technology is used -- infrared, 900Mhz, 2.4Ghz, whatever -- sound quality simply cannot be called ""good."" Of all the wireless headphones I've tried, none is good for music listening. The only use is for watching TV late at night without disturbing other occupants of your living space. This Sony infrared set is the same. It's no better or worse than other infrared sets. Be prepared for lots of hisses, even when you are just a couple feet away from the transmitter.While this Sony set is inexpensive, you can get a similar-performing pair sold under the Radio Shack brand at Radio Shack for under $20. For all the hisses and poor sound quality, I think that's a fairer price to pay. Radio Shack part no. 33-1234."
4,Work Reasonably Well But,"For the most part I am happy with this purchase and it performs as advertised. However do have two things about it that are bothersome, as follows:1. Find headset is not as comfortable to wear as it should be.2. Have to carefully set volume control on headset and then TV output to eliminate annoying static/hiss. If done right sound is good on headphones but takes some doing to get this adjustment right.For the money they are a good buy and do work well."
2,Good but ...,"I liked the charger, the plastic and metal and how they sit. But they produced loud hissing noise even when not connected to a source. Maybe I just got defected item ... I had to return them."
1,What a POS,I am speechless. Simply a POS. You would think buying a Sony product would be buying quality. Purely disappointing. I've never given my time to wright a review before but I am appalled. I literally have to be standing 1 ft away to get a clear signal.
3,Pros & Cons,The pros- Excellent price- Terrific battery life and ease of charging- Keeps the signalThe cons- Have to use at full volume (no headroom for more volume)- ON/OFF & Volume control difficult to find and turn onOverall a good buy and useful product.
1,Too much static,Too much static. Not worth it. I was dissapointed. I wish I had just gone for the tv ears. This is very short range.
3,Love,I bought these for my husband. His last pair stopped working and they used regular batteries. We love that these have a recharable battery but he perfers the ones that cup around the ear. They work perfectly and the sounds is great.
1,Poor Quality,These do not work well at all. There is a lot of fuzzy noice and when you turn your head they do not come in at all. Wish I could return for a full refund.
1,Sony MDR-IF240RK Wireless Headphone System,"The worst headphone I have ever bought.Walk away 10 ft. it is very static and lose sound when turn head.I replaced the first set and the 2nd set was no better.If I was Sony I would take them off the market.Poor quality headphone.Thank you,Jake form Birmingham, AL"
2,Too much static,"These headphones have an annoying low level static sound, even when the TV is muted. I am returning them. I would't recommend them. I expected better from Sony."
1,Not what I expected,"This wireless headphones plugs into the side of my Sharp 42"" wall mounted TV in my bedroom. It has a single connection into the TV which kills the sound of the TV. After a day with very little use my headphones stopped working. I disconnected the phones and reconnected the it to the TV the following evening. It played for a few minutes and again stopped. I think the wattage, ohms or voltage may be a factor. Since I do not have a clue, I am going to order another Sony model wireless headphones that I have been using for the past three years on my Sharp in the living room. This model cost twice as much but it works, and it doesn't kill the sound of the TV. Also, I can walk to the mail box and still hear the sound. As the old saying goes, ""You get what you pay for."""
5,These work great .........,These work great .........Sony MDR-IF240RK Wireless Headphone System....I use them in the bedroom. I watch TV~and my husband sleeps very sound not hearing the TV!~
4,Great headphones,"I purchased my first set of these from Sears. They are very nice looking, they fit well and the sound quality exceeds my expectations. But I am satisfied with the stock sound systems in my vehicles. For the money, buy these. They will not work around corners. The base must be in sight."
4,Sony MDR-IF240RK Wireless Headphone System,"Easy setup, sound quality is good and is comfortable on head. Have to be directly in front of the transmitter to receive good quality. When I move from one chair to another, distance of five feet, I had to reposition the transmitter."
1,the worst,it does not work at all have to move it on the bed just to get a little reception wasted my money
1,piss and short distance connection,"It only works within about ten feet without any obstacle. compared to my another wireless headset at work, works at about 50 feet from office to bathroom, two concrete wall. I am very disappointed at my first sony product."
1,Wireless headset,"I am sorry, but I cannot get this thing to work. All I hear is static. I am returning this item. Thank you."
1,don't buy this item,I purchased this headset for my husband to replace one that was 10 years old and worn out. The sound is fine but you cannot walk into another room. The sound cuts off. If you walk in front of the person wearing it this happens also. I am very dissapointed and will return them. You get what you pay for!
1,"GOOD PRICE, GOOD SERVICE, POOR PRODUCT","THIS HEADSET WORKED VERY POORLY. SOUND WAS EXTREMELY WEAK EVEN WITHIN SEVERAL FEET OF THE TV. THE BACKGROUND NOISE WAS LOUD ENOUGH TO SMOTHER THE SOUND WHENEVER THERE WAS SOME SOUND. HOWEVER, I WAS EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THE WAY AMAZON HANDLED THE RETURN."
5,Not In Service at This Point In Time,Have used Sony products in the past and have been impressed with their quality. Still using a previous private earphone and reserve judgement until I've put the Sony product into service.
3,Sony MDR-IF240RK,"Headset is light and easy to use. The only problem is distance from the transmitter to the headset, i.e., if I walk from my family room and into the kitchen (which does require going around a corner), I lose the signal. Otherwise, this is a fine headset at an excellent price point."
1,Tooooo much Hissing. Tooooooo much crap.,"So I was hoping these would get here in time, what I should have hoped for was that they would work as expected. They got here on time but the constant hissing form the ear phones really takes away any listening pleasure. Further more there are no instructions on how to possibly fix the hissing. The battery life sucks, sometime they last a few hours, sometimes a 30 minutes. Will buy some other make next time, not this pile of crap."
1,Don't buy this item. Does not work.,"This is a total waste of money. Don't buy it. I purchased it in April and just start using it yesterday. It has a lot of static background noise and the signal will fall off about 15-20 feet. Then, it just quit working and the ""charge"" light doesn't go on even if you put the headset on the charger. I noticed similar incidents have been reported by other user. There must be some kind of design defect. Very disappointed at Sony.Sony MDR-IF240RK Wireless Headphone System"
1,"not very good range, single room only","would not recommend buying these headphones , very poor range, can't leave the room and hear anything but static. i would spend a little more and buy a better quality set, make sure they can function thru the walls."
2,flawed product,"I bought these Sony headphones expecting that they would work well in allowing us to hear the TV (without having the volumne on 40)while using our treadmill about 20 feet away. However I was quickly disappointed by experiencing static interference at that range. So,I moved the TV closer to the treadmill and that seems to help. But there is still interference if you touch anything metal (like the handlebars) or come close to an energy source like the surge protector.It's a nice idea but a flawed product with too many limitations for the price."
1,Sony Is not the brand anymore,The brand Is not the hight tech brand that used to beThey Don' t tell that it will not work with a plasma TVIt' s simply trash
2,Sony MDR-IF240RK Wireless Headphone System,"There are 2 real issues with the unit. One, the foam earpiece cover falls off easily. The second issue is that the volume of the two ear pieces are not equal. That is annoying. However, it is not worth the hassle (and cost) of shipping the unit back. It was less than $40. And my intended use was to use it to watch TV late at night and not wake up my wife."
3,breaks down after 1.5 years of use,"the earmuffs will starts to unravel after a while, for me it took about a year to a year and a half for it to slowly come off, after the earmuffs comes off, the right headphone starts to die out too. Adjusting the volume back and forth seemed to make it come back to life, but after a while of adjusting, the right headphones begins to die. I also noticed after long use ( as in putting it on and off), the static noise becomes bigger, and theres not much interference in my room for it to become much more staticky, but it did. It has a clear line of sight too :(. So if your'e planning to switch or buy a new one everyone 1.5 years or so, then i suggest this is a good product to do so. If you're planning on long term reliability, dont look at this item."
2,Sony MDR-IF240RK Wireless headphone System,"I really Loved this headphone and it worked great for a month. Then after using it for a month it starting acting up,the sound would go when i opened then up to put them on my head and after there on the sound would come back on. If I would of known that they were going to break down I wouldn't of bought them.The sony is making a lot of items with glitches.I wouldn't recommend these headphones they're the worst,don't spend your money on these you'll have problems too."
1,970 blows the 240 away,"The MDR-IF240RK sound quality stinks. There is always a hiss in the background. Also, if you cover the right ear piece the sound shuts off. Obviously the receiver is in the right ear piece. Sometimes just turning your head toward the right will cause them to loose their signal. Spend the extra money and get the MDR-RF970RK. The sound quality is awsome. The signal strength is great; you can walk around the house and not loose signal."
1,Not the typical Sony product,"As a believer in Sony products, I was shocked at the low quality of this item. A few issues were:- Range: Was reported to be 24 feet. Best I got was 10 feet.- Noise: Constantly heard loud hiss.- Battery: Was never able to get it to fully charged.- Overall quality: Would only work for 5 minutes at a time.I returned this product to Amazon and urge you to consider a different wireless headphone."
1,Hopeless,"The sound simply did not carry from the TV a few feet across the room to where I sit, except in very a crackly and fuzzy way. The product was therefore useless to me but at the time I thought it not worth the bother or expense of sending it back."
2,Very dissapointed.,"These headphones recieve a lot of static and I am less than six feet from the reciever they are plugged into. I usually am satisfied with products from Sony, but unfortunately not these headphones."
4,Gift for my Dad,He had a little trouble hooking up the headphones. My brother helped and all is well. My dad loves these things and so does my mother who hates to listen to the TV. Dad watches and listens to 4 different ball games at one time and this truly helps mother. I am pleased
4,Great for home use!,"Bought these for my husband who definitely has trouble watching t.v. without volume so loud it's uncomfortable for others. While this unit wouldn't work in our den, ostensibly because of our wifi, it works just great in his mancave where he can watch and hear easily. Comfortable, easy to install, and it just works! I recommend definitely. Just wish it would work in the den but I can't do away with or turn off my wifi."
2,"Loud hiss, poor range, misleading description","The first thing I noted when I received these headphones were that they were very flimsy. They feel cheap and unsturdy. The second issue was that the ear pads are very small. I am a 6' tall male, and the headphones fit very poorly over my ears, leading to an uncomfortable fit.The third issue is that nowhere in the product description is it mentioned that these are IR as opposed to bluetooth or RF. This means that you may only use the headphones when there is a direct line of sight between headphones and transmitter. This is unacceptable, and it should be mentioned in the description that they are IR. All-in-all, I am going to try and return these to Amazon, and avoid any future Sony wireless headphones."
2,Not very good,"Sound quality not very good, controls on headphones tiny and hard to operate while wearing them.Connection cord from source to transmitter too short. When I use headphones white watching TV there is a constant hiss."
2,Not good,"I have used these wireless headphones for about a year. Then often mentioned background hiss can be minimized with more volume, unless the voices are low. Occasionally, there would be an""electronic"" type sound which, starting softly, became louder. At its apex the sound was quite loud ending with a very loud sharp, again, ""electronic"" pop.Sony sent me another set of phones. The sounds began again. In talking with a friend he said it was probably caused by the small RF frequency, I believe he said in the 500 area, and slightly moving the transmitter a few inches should take care it. It works.This problem solved, now the volume in each ear varies to where the left side may be off entirely. Shaking it a bit seemed to improve this, but for me, this unit is not up to Sony's typical quality.There are probably other quality choices."
3,Some static,"These headphones work well if you use them on a very low volume (only loud enough to hear). If your ears are not very sharp and you turn the volume up static becomes a problem. The louder the volume, the more static, so if your hearing isn't great these headphones are not for you."
2,Sony so disappointed me,"I never expected that a Sony product would disappoint me this much. Many people complained that Infrared won't allow you to go room from room while still hearing the sound, but I thought that would be OK since I am only goning to watch my movie and sit in the same room. But the truth is that this Infrared product won't allow you to hear any clear sound at all!!! The static hissing is always there and it may even build up and get to a stage where the noise is too strong and I can't hear anything else. And it really hurts my ears!!!As soon as I went for a different Wi-Fi product, everything works just great.Maybe my case is a little extreme, but it did happen, which makes me believe Sony isn't showing the high quality that they are well known of in this product. So please do think it over before purchasing.BTW, I returned it already."
3,good enough,"Decent headphones for tv watching late at night when you don't want to have to turn the sound up too high to hear the tv over someone snoring. There is some amount of static at high volumes, but it does the job."
5,Sleep Saver Wireless Headphones,"So far, for the money these wireless headphones are a great addition to my evening TV watching. My wife can sleep in complete silence and I'm no longer nagged to turn the TV down...Good reception and sound clarity are exactly as advertised and the headphones are comfortable to wear as well. The on/off slide switch is a little difficult to activate, but hopefully this will improve as I wear the headphones more often."
1,Did Not Work for Me,"I could not find any position for the base that did not cause a buzzing noise in the headphones that was anywhere from low, but definitely noticeable, loudness to very loud. Overall, this looks like a cheap product."
1,Avoid.,"There was no scenario in which I could get these headphones not to suck. Incredibly poor reception even in direct line of site at 10'. Painful static if you so much as turn your head even slightly. A complete waste of time and money.I got the earphones to use wile on my treadmill at night. I tried everything possible get them to work. I replaced the batteries with known good batteries (even though it comes with its own rechargeable ones - which had charged for more than 24hours before I tried using the set). I put the transmitter high on a shelf so that it could be in direct line of site to the earphones. I turned off all other lights in the room.... nothing would get me a clear, quality signal. I could maybe keep the signal slightly static free for a few seconds, but any movement of my head to the right or left immediately left my ears ringing with painful static. I really gave these things a good try, I really wanted them to work. Oh well."
1,False Advertising,"I was extremely disappointed in this product. Sony fails to tell you that these headphones are not compatible with all televisions, especially the newer ones. I discovered that this cordless headphone system would not work with my new Toshiba exactly two days after my return window expired. I think Amazon should be a little more careful what products they carry and whether or not they are being advertised falsely. And shame on Sony."
2,Not for HDTV,"They are comfortable, but there is severe buzzing when connected to an HD TV. They are OK on the LCD TV, but still background noise."
3,not comfortable,"As someone said in a recent review, these work fine except that they need cushioning on top of the head. I find that one is quickly out of range.."
3,Not too impressed,"the headset I bought was a gift for my elderly mother. It is flimsy, comes apart at the ear piece easily, and the sound is not the best. Lots of white noise filters in with the sound. If I would have held them in my hand before purchasing, I would have purchased something else."
2,Good but just barely,"These Sony headphones are good but do have issues,the on off switch is located in a bad spot hard to turn off and on.Not real comfortable not what you expect from Sony!These are over priced by at least $15.00.Would not buy these again."
4,Well it finaly got there a day late,"The item is fine, it's reception is good only in direct view of the transmitter moduledo not attempt to go to another room with in the stated 150 ft you will loose reception.The shipping was a disappointment. Requested next business day express service. ie Fed-ex.the status report showed left seller facility Parsons KS on 9/8 @ 5:10pm next showedreceived by carrier @ 2:16PM 9/8 Parsons KS, departed Coffeyville KS at 4:40PM 9/8delivered to destination 12:26pm 9/10 a day after the birthday! How can you these timesmake any sense? Did not get the transit service that was paid for, nor documentedin a logical fashion? Oh Well !!!!!!!"
1,"Great idea, poor performance","I saw this and thought it looked great, but looks can be deceiving. It was a snap to set up and get ready to go. That's where the positives of this product ended for me. First, the headset itself is bulky and ill fitting. The adjustment of the headset is hindered by the spring loaded earpieces. If you have to extend the headset to get a good fit, plan on adjusting them often as the springs continually pull the earpieces up from your ears. Once I finally got a decent fit (by turning the headphones around and putting them across the back of my neck) I noticed a hissing feedback. No matter how I adjusted the volume on the source (in this case my laptop) and the headphones, there was always the hissing coming through. I tried a few different sources (TV, iPod, PSP) still the hissing was prevalent. I would not recommend anyone buying this particular model of wireless headphones."
1,They were broken and did not charge!,When I received the item the left side strap was cracked nearly all the way through. I figured it was a shipping issue. Then when I hooked them up they did not charge. I took them apart and repaired the contacts. All is good now thanks to my ability to repair things in need.
1,Bad range,These headphones wont even work 5 feet away in a separate room from where the base unit is placed. Returned them. This might be my first return on anything I bought from Amazon.
2,Line of sight reception only,"I like that they're small.I like that they're light.I hate that if I get a wall between me and the base -- even if it's only 6 - 8 feet from the base, I lose all reception.I can get a wireless headphone from the dollar store for half the price that works on another floor. This works 10-15 ft if there's a line of sight but forget it if you want to go to another room or another floor."
2,Wireless Headphone Review,"I'm looking for products that last for years, so a review after less than 2 months is of limited value. For what its worth: These headphones work, so far. They are poorly designed in comfort and fit to head. Internal springs continually pull them back into their smallest configuration. They should stay where you adjust them to, unless another user readjusts. Specs substantially understate battery charging times. Re-chargeable battery is proprietary in design, forcing you to buy replacement from Sony, which is good for them, bad for us. I probably won't buy Sony again, unless they change allow generic replacement batteries. I would prefer an AC/adapter option for powering headphones, as an alternative to batteries. How green would that be?"
1,Sony P.O.S.,These are awful! If the dollar store carried wireless headphones this is what would be on the shelf. You're lucky to get 10ft of distance in line of sight. Forget walking around a corner. The sound is horrible. The louder you turn it up the more garbled noise you can hear! So not worth the price tag. I sent these back and have now ordered the Acoustic Research AW721. I'm sure these will be a lot better!!!!
3,"Okay, but not the best...","I'm not crazy about these headphones. The battery life and range is too short. For the money not a bad purchase, if you're looking for something relatively cheap."
2,Too much popping,Very disappointed. I bought these so that I could watch TV while my husband sleeps. There is alot of popping noise in the audio. I notice its worse when the video is bright. I tried to move the base unit to different locations and still have the same problem. I do not recommend for plasma TV's. Connected this to my daughters LCD and it worked fine.
1,Warranty,"The product worked great for two weeks. It then became defective. At first the sound would go off after about 20 minutes. If turned off for awhile, then put back in use the same thing would happen. Then it began causing occasional static.I called Sony and followed their instructions for return on Oct. 6.As of yesterday, I didn't get a confirmation of any kind from Sony. So, I called and they told me they could not find it in their warehouse and I should call back today.I called UPS and they confirmed that the product was rec'd by Sony on Oct. 12.I was very pleased with the performace of the product and was looking forward to a replacement. However, I'm very disappointed in the laxity of Sony.I need the product in order to listen to TV comfortably and now it has been 2 weeks and Sony can't even find my product in their warehouse. Thank you if you can provide any help."
1,Cannot believe its is such a poor quality product,"I was going to buy a 20 bucks headphones but decided to doubkle the cost and go for the sure thing, SONY.It is extremly noisy, a continuos fuzz is present all the time and all of the sudden it just stops working. I have to unplug and plug it again as if it were a computer that needs to be restarted. regret this purchase very much. I have 32 LCD Philips TV."
3,Vulnerable to interference,"The sound is fine and I was pleased with these headphones until I stepped on the treadmill, the purpose for which I bought them.As soon as I turned the treadmill on, the sound from the headphones disappeared completely. I assume that the electromagnetic field from the treadmill's engine blocked all transmission between the headphone and its base station. Whatever the reason, the headphones were useless for their intended purpose and I returned them. I would recommend them otherwise."
3,"A little Noisy, but does the job","You can hear a good amount of white noise when you are on mute. The noise isn't all that bad when you are watching a program, but you can still hear it if you pay attention. The range is very poor. Also, I had hoped that it would let me switch between the TV speaker and the headphone, but thats not how it works. The best you can do it to keep the TV speaker at a volume of 1, and use the headphone. it doesn't let you shut the TV volume off completely when you use the headphone. OK product. You get what you pay for."
2,Infra Red!,"I had no ides this unit was infra red and could be blocked be walls. When I first tried it out I was shocked when I discovered that it stopped working when the transmitor was blocked by a plant on my TV. It seems to work fine if there are zero obstructions, but, as for me, I will try to get my money back.P.S. When I purchased this item last week it had four stars."
1,Great headphones if you like constant static,"From the moment you turn them on, the statics starts. I mean LOUD static. As with many of my ""toys"", they are somewhere now in the bottom of my closet."
1,Don't waste your money,"I am loyal to Sony products but this was a huge disappointment. I tried it, put it back in the box and sent it back..Why? number of reasons..1. cheap design material, never expected from Sony.. you can actually feel the cheap plastic without even touching it.2. doesn't cover ears fully.3. This is the biggest one..Constant humming sound. It was so distracting and annoyingi felt like throwing this thing away.4. Sound quality not so great.in short, put some more money and buy a good product..do not waste your money."
1,Paid decent dollar horrid buy,"When i bought this i though that it would have a microphone. I was okay when i found out it didn't. I shrugged it off, it took 16 hours to fully charge before i could FINALLY start to use it. It claims you have a pretty good distance on it. Yet i can't go 5 feet without it getting ugly. I can't stand if its to low, or sit if its to high. I bought this for my computer because i don't want tv and my cat destroys wires. As i'm sitting all i'm getting is buzzing even though the base isn't even a foot away from me. I will not return the item. But i will NOT buy one like this. WORST PRODUCT EVER!! (the reviews had said it was good! XP) Also it clearly states you have a full 90 angle spread so you can move around the room. I CAN'T EVEN TURN AROUND! It cuts off and lord forbid someone walks by it. Seriously save your money."
1,if you like hissssssss,"If you like hissssssssssssssssss these are the phones for you. These head phones are terrible, and it is hard to belive that anyone could enjoy theme. Waste of money."
5,Very Pleased With Sony MDR-IF240RK Wireless Headphone System,"No more missed dialogue, no more guessing what was said, since using the wireless headphones!My husband is entirely satisfied with the Sony product.We have opted to use disposable batteries in the device rather than bother with recharging the one in the headphones.He wishes that he could mute some advertisements with the regular remote but understands why that is not possible!"
5,Great Product!,"I bought these for my husband since he loves to watch spy and war movies early on Saturday mornings and always used to wake me up with all the shooting and screaming. Now he wears these headphones and we are both very happy!!! He can hear better without having to turn the volume way up and I can sleep :) The range is great, if you adjust the volume (which was very easy) there is no static at all. One of the best purchases I have made in a long time!"
1,Horrible ... Crap ... Stay away ...,I owned a pair of JVC wireless headphones for years. I thought this pair would be nice since they are more compact and received fair reviews. You have to be practicallt standing in front of them for them to work. They cut out when you are standing beside them. Save your money and go with JVC.
1,not worth it,The Sony headphone system is okay if you don't mind replacing it every year. Have had 3 of them and they don't seem to make it though the warranty period including the first unit purchased year. The free replacements only have a 90 day warranty so beyond that its your nickel to replace it. Expected more from a Sony product but I guess quality control and durability are not their strong point.
3,sony wireless headphones,"First set of phones had a distinctive buzz when using with panasonic 50 "" plasma. I returned them for a second set. Amazon exchanged them and it was a very easy process. Unfortunately second set has the same problem. I had hoped that a new set would rectify this problem, but I guess at the $40.00 price tag, this is the best you can hope for."
5,Great Product,"Once I got this device hooked up to my receiver properly, it works great. It has great volume control, and better than advertised range. It says it will work up to 7 meters; it actually works much further from the transmitter. Now I can listen to programs without bothering my wife."
1,"noisy, short range, uncomfortable","No matter where the phones were in relation to the transmitter, there was always scratchy noise and weak signal. Was not easy nor was I totally successful in connecting a sony tv set.. that is odd, these are sony... and, they were dreadfully uncomfortable! Don't waste your time or money as the packaging is designed to prevent returning in the original box resulting in a large restocking fee.."
2,April to July,I bought these in April as I share an office with someone and wanted to be able to listen to the radio without being tethered to a wire. I really only used them maybe 10 times over the next few months. Recently I tried to use them and after about 10 minutes they make a squelching sound then nothing. I have to restart the receiver to get them to work again and then they only work a few more minutes before it happens again. I came on Amazon to see if I can find the warranty information but I'm not having any luck with that.
1,Sony Wireless headphones,"These headphones are not worth their weight. We tried everything to make the hissing sound fade to the background noise, but no can do..smaller darker room, no success. My son will keep them because it's too much trouble to send them back. He said he might use them if his roommate at college ever has a problem with a show he is watching, but the excitement of these headphones faded quickly, the hissing is tedious."
2,Poor Product,"As a bit of background, I use this in my bedroom with my TV, which is only 8 feet away. With that said, I still get a lot of static on these headphones, when they work. Since it's line of sight, I have to look at the TV just right or I get a lot of static. Recently, I will get a surge in volume and then speakers just cut out. When this happens, I need to unplug the power on the base and replug it back in. Not happy with this product."
1,NOT FOR TV USE - POOR PRODUCT,TV USE - do not buy this product if you plan on using it with your tv - the product comes with wiring for a walkman or stereo - the wiring supplied will not work with our tv - we had to go to radio shack to buy the proper wiring.the earphones produce a hissing sound as well. very poor product - worth 10 to 15 bucks.
4,Great Product Excellent Value,"I needed a silent audio option for my new upstairs HDTV and these headphones are perfect and a great value at $42/NO shipping. It took a few tries to get the right orientation of the headphones in the cradle so the ""charging"" red light comes on. And it took a few uses to learn how to quickly adjust the head strap which retracts automatically (will probably tape it to my head size). The only thing I would change is the ear pads (which I hope are replaceable). I would have made them a little thicker and thus softer but I do have large ears. It seems the recharge battery is proprietary and generally I don't like being forced to order from the manufacturer but I expect the Web to tell me what my REAL options are."
4,Saves the Household,"The Sony Remote Headphones work well, adequately. They permit me to watch TV without disturbing others in the household. They go to bed before I do and they don't like what I watch anyway.I would like to point out that Amazon recommends a phone plug adaptor as a helpful support purchase. Such a purchase is not necessary. An adaptor is supplied with the headphones."
3,Sony wireless headphones,"Overall I am happy with the product. I liked it's versitility in the way you connect it to the TV, by either using the headphone jack or the audio video jacks in the back of the TV. The only thing I don't like about it is, if your audio video jacks on the TV are already being used for another device, then you are forced to use the small headphone jack on the side of the TV. The only problem with that is, when you use the headphone jack, it automatically cuts the sound to the TV speakers, making sound unavailable to others trying to watch the same show you are. I mostly use the headphones because I'm hard of hearing and don't want to crank the TV up too loud to make it uncomfortable to others around me listening to the same show. The sound quality through the headphones is ok, but could be improved accoustically."
1,Item returned,"I'm not sure if it was the item that I received or the item in general, but I sent it back because of a buzzing noise. I bought the headphones for my dad for Christmas and when he set them up he could not get the buzzing noise to go away. The return went smoothly and I purchased a corded set of headphones instead that worked great."
2,Not what I thought it would be,I thought the headphones were the 'cup' variety and not the flat headphones that do not block out sound at all. I do not know if the quality is decent as they were a gift and my wife is going to return them. From the photo I thought they would be different.
1,Huge Disapointment!,"Ordered these for my wife to watch shows quietly on our JVC LT-32E488 hooked up to our audio out (RCA)connections. Could not resolve the interference(loud hiss sound)and poor signal strength OR find information on how to resolve this issue. Did find other people dissatisfied with similar issues online, but complaints only. Could not find fix articles on cnet or other audiophile sites. Tried isolating out other wireless signal sources, without luck. Sent them back. Suggest trying them only if you can tolerate the frustration that goes hand in hand with buying electronics these days....alot of the stuff sucks."
4,good Neighbor proof headset,"North-East USA, NJ--I have owned three (3) of these over the years...The first set lasted about 6 years before wear and performance required replacement.The second set lasted less than 1 year before replacement--very Disappointed.I'm still working on the first year for the third set.Overall--I would recommend this product. IR based removes the possibility that EM savvy neighbors are eavesdropping. Reasonable range for IR transmitter allows almost 180 degree mobility around transmitter. It keeps wife happy when I want to watch DVR at 2:00AM--she hears nothing. Who's going to invent the video equivalent of this nice audio solution????"
5,95 Year old nursing home patient,"I can't really compare these to similar products very well because I have only purchased 2 sets. The ones from another manufacturer, which cost twice as much, did not work and had to be returned. These I purchased for my mother who is 95, in a nursing home and says she hasn't heard anything this good for years. Her hearing is very bad and she ran over her last hearing aid with her wheelchair and decided not to bother with another. She can now hear the TV accurately without blasting out her roommate at the nursing home and everyone in the hall as well. She is in a reasonably small room so range is unknown and she has not had them long enough to tell about battery life. The only negative is the very small on switch which her poor vision won't let her see. But she enjoys them so much she will find someone to turn them on for her,"
2,ok but not great,I bought these headphones for my dad...they do the job but1.the phones don't fit easily on the base to charge ..a bit tricky you have to move them around until you get the right position & the charging light turns on2.you have to face the transmitter if you move your head to the side .. static takes overwould not recommend..if you want something reliable and good buy other headphones
1,Why you don't want this item,"These headphones work fine, but only if you place the transmitter on thefloor and sit or stand directly in front of it. The battery takes over one day to charge and the charge only lasts about 10 hours. I use it on my TV and I'm going to look for another headphone set."
3,"It's not the best, but its ok","The range is not good, when you go away from the TV you can't hear anything anymore."
4,Decent wireless headphones,"We have used these headphones for over 6 months now. We were tired of using headphones with cords, so these were a good replacement. You need to be within 20 feet of the infrared base and have it fairly lined up to get any sound. You do get fairly quiet, constant static in the background, but it is acceptable. We really like the fact that we can control our individual sound. We are planning on buying another set for visitors."
2,Just OK,"I purchased these to watch TV as my infant likes to nap on the weekends in her swing in the living room. They worked OK for my use, but they would cut out occasionally. Also, one ear was fuzzy, but that could have been my unit. I returned these and purchased some re-manufactured Sennheiser 900 mhz headphones for about the same price. Those work great all the time and I even tested them out into my back yard."
5,Wireless Headphones,"I ordered these so as not to interrupt my son while he's grinding out tunes on guitar hero buy shouting ""turn that darn thing down"", that being said the plan worked beautifully and I cant even tell he's playing Hero or any game . Im thinkin i'll get another pair for when his friend comes over to play.I found another use though . Im an early riser and like to watch news and market reports at 5:30 am so I strap em on and don't wake the wife.The sound is better than plain TV. I plug them into my home theatre amplifier so you should question how you're going to set them up before buying.There is fabric that goes over the earpiece that can be knocked off so they should have inserted spares.They are inexpensive, sound good , and keep peace and quiet in the house, what else you want?"
3,Not upto spec..... Very restricted usage ...,"Has ridiculous range of access the base (much less that in spec) - only around 8 food. Even so it is light - much lighter then Sennheiser Rs110 for instance.I have returned it, as the device has working range much less of what is specified in spec."
4,Sony Wireless Headphone System,"The only fault I found in this system is that I need to stay at close range of the base to receive the sound. In my old system, I was able to walk out of the room and still hear the sound; then I knew when the commercial was over, and I could return to the TV set. Otherwise, it's quite nice, light-weight and has a very clear sound."
3,Good,for $40.00 you cannot get a better pair of IR headphones. The headphones are somewhat uncomofortable if you keep them on hours at a time. That is the only negative point.
1,Not Satisfied,We were surprisingly unsatisfied with this product. There was a lot of background noise. Audio would cut in and out. Ended up returning this item for a full refund.
2,Wireless Headphones,"I bought a pair of Acoustic Research Headphones from Radio Shack about 6 years ago for around $100.00. They are wonderfull. The Sony's were half the cost and can't hold a candle to them. I can wear thr A.R.'s while walking into another room and not miss a beat, whereas the Sony's cut out if your hand passes in front of them. They do have a decent sound though. Not great but decent."
1,Lots of Interference with plasma TV,"The product information online did not say that plasma displays could cause interference. That information is in small print in the booklet that came with the headphones. These headphones do not work with a plasma TV; it was like listening to white noise. I then tried them on an LCD TV and the results were better, although there was still a minor amount of interference. However, I found the headphones too heavy and so returned them even though they worked with the LCD TV. The product information online should make it very clear that these won't work with a plasma TV."
4,Sony Wireless Headphones,"These work good for the price. I didn't get the ones that let you go into another room and still hear, those cost a lot more. The battery stays charged for a long time, several days even. They are moderately comfortable, but a little more padding on the ear covers would have been nice. I can hear well with them and that's all I was looking for. The only other thing is that the button to turn them on and off is VERY small and sometimes difficult to turn on or off. The volume knob works just fine."
2,Noisy,It makes a buzzing noise while watching TV and that bothers me. I was only 10 ft away from TV.....Not worth the money.
3,You get what you pay for,"I chose these headphones because of the price and the Sony name. I believe in this case, I got what I paid for. The headphones are easy to use and comfortable, but have a high amount of hissing unless you are at a perfect angle with the transmitter and very close. I would spend a little more to get better sound if I had it to do over."
1,Not what was expected,Doesn't work on plasma tvs. Will be sending them back. They buzz. Plastic on top is cheap. Needs top padding.
5,sony mdr-if-240rk wireless headphones,"great,easy to hookup, the sound is great,very light when you have them on,easy to use right out of the box"
5,Sony MDR-IF240RK Wireless Headphone System,"It works!! So many do not do the job. I am hard of hearing, and I can listen to movies with my husband without it blaring."
5,Alfalfa seed,Good sprouting time. For those who like to sprout it seems very fresh. Thanks for providing this item for sale
2,Seed is prone to mold!,"Other alfalfa seed that I have had did not mold. This seed molds after the sprouts start to grow. It is okay, I will just have to get food grade peroxide because it happens with about every type of seed."
5,Great Seeds!,"I love these seeds, they make tasty sprouts and can be grown with so much ease. I can have greens in Winter and without the toil of a garden."
2,Seeds are good... shipping too much.,"Seeds are nice and tasty... However, shipping almost doubles the price. Found a local organic seller of seeds and the price is much better."
1,Printed paper in the middle of the organic seeds.,Why would you want to buy seeds that are rubbing against a piece of colored printed paper that was obviously folded and inserted by someone. Organic seeds shouldn't have foreign substances in them period. Think about it. To tell you the truth they shouldn't even be in a plastic bag. Paper bags like the one's that Eden uses for their beans would be perfect. Plastic is nothing more than petroleum.
4,CatchThis Train,"I enjoyed my ride and even though there were a few stops I had to take a stand and walk around to make sure I was on the right train, the conductor never let me down for long and I always reach my destination when I got on!"
4,Worth the wading through,Betz has produced one of the best works on the Sermon on the Mount. There is something in his volume for everyone. The only downside is you have to wade through a lot of material to get what you want out of the volume. He does have very insightful comments on the individual sections of the Sermon.
1,bad processor problems,i've been getting macs since the 1980s and this one is a lemon. the processor went after only 2 years. get something else.
3,Caveat emptor from a Mac enthusiast,"I bought mine in March 2006 and the display died October 2007. If you don't have the extended warranty it will cost $$$ if anything on the logic board fails or if the LCD panel fails. Since the video card is part of the logic board you don't have many options for repair. I wish it had a DVI output for an external monitor since you cannot currently connect it to any displays that Apple sells. The quality of the DVI connection is much better than the mini-VGA present on this iMac. Otherwise it's a great OS X machine. When the display worked, it was beautiful."
4,Everything I hoped for,"This machine is just everything I was hoping when I placed the order. It is beautiful, effective and priced very competitively too. I thought I missed out on the new kid (with intel chip) but was satisfied that the subsequent price drop on the older! model was honoured with a $200 refund. Very happy with it overall."
5,Good Value for Money,"This is my 4th apple computer, and the first apple desktop. All I can say is it is well worth the money.I bought it for my kids and also wanted to keep it in the living room, something that does not take too much space, and looks nice.I have to admit, I am using it to a fair degree too, and I like the software programs that come with it.Overall, I think it is money well spent."
1,Overheating problems,I only use this computer because I have to at work - It's practically useless due to overheating problems. A computer should be able to burn a cd without overheating to the point of freezing up.
4,I am really impressed.,"I have been using a PC for a long time. We bought a iMac G4 for the kids and fell in love with it. So I went and bought the iMac G5 20"" with the 2.1 GHz processor. All I can say is this computer is just great. I've used lots of computers, but none like this one. I am really impressed. Maybe the price could be better, the only reason I stuck with PC's for so long."
1,What in the world?!,"This is a horrible item. It doesn't work at all. I bought it brand new and it looks like it should work fine. When it's plugged in and recording, it makes random loud clicks that send the audio meters to red. If that wasn't bad enough, in order to get it to pick up any audio, the gain (on my computer) has to be up as far as it can go and I have to hold the microphone within two inches of my mouth. Maybe I got a defective product."
2,"It works, but sound quality is not good","Other than the power switch is not easy to see, the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality not that good. Use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you. Even using it for church meeting recording, you would not get excited for its sound quality.If you can tolerate the size of Sony ECM-MS907, you may like the sound quality of that microphone. If you like a small lapel microphone with true voice, try the AKG WMS-40 wireless system. Our people are much happier with the AKG wireless microphone than this one."
1,"Disappointed, Does not work half the time....","I bought this as a preacher and a speaker to digitally record my messages. It has a niche in the back that you turn with a coin to turn it ""off"" and ""on"" but you never know it's on until it is to late. Save yourself the trouble, buy another one besides this one."
1,did not work,I bought this to record into my laptop which does not have an internal mic. It sort of records when I yell into it but the sound quality is horrid. Unusable.
2,"Fantastic Vinyl, Drastic CD","I bought this LP when it first came out in the late 70's. It's great, I'd rate it at 4 or 5 stars. But one thing that no one so far has commented on is the sound of the CD you get if you make this purchase, and that is important because after all this is a retail store. The LP had great production values with lots of sonic detail that made it an excellent LP to listen to on headphones. The CD reissued in 1990 in Holland, leased from EMI, that I bought new recently here at Amazon, is a different story altogether. The sound is muffled and muddy. Even the reproduction of the lyrics are blurry. No one listening to this CD would understand what I saw in the LP. I would recommend avoiding this particular CD reissue."
3,"Not their best, but not bad by any means","This one doesn't hold up as well for me over the years as their earlier 5-STAR studio albums do. There are some decent songs on here, but it seems like they were unsure what direction the band should take. There are hints of New Wave and industrial influences, but the ""outtakes"" from the Be Bop Deluxe compilations show that they were also flirting with jazz fusion at the time!In keeping with the New Wave sound, the recording is quite dry, a marked contrast from the liquid, crystalline sound of their earlier work. Sonically, it was a bit of a shock, almost in the same way the dry-sounding ""Tormato"" was for YES fans. Nonetheless, it's still BBD and Bill Nelson, and if you're a fan, you'll find plenty to like here. It's just not as ""essential"" as Futurama, Sunburst Finish or Modern Music."
2,Mixed bag of (useless) traditional blues covers,"Alvin Hart opens this album with an amazing Charley Patton impersonation which gave it its title. And I think it's amazing not because you can compare Hart with the original, but because Patton's (like Son House's) music are some of the most difficult blues to cover ever. I even would say that this kind of blues should not be covered on ""new"" versions: the world has changed just too much from the Mississippi Delta in the 1930's, and on these days of non-smoking and political correction, the so-called ""blues"" artists just are doing no good to the real thing in the end, which of course lies just on those old recordings you'll never hear on your local radio. The thing is on the original recordings by the original artists. No way on the new Robert Johnson's covers album by Eric Clapton, or John Hammond Jr. Or, even worst, Duke Robillard or Debbie Davies (!)."
1,released too early,"All great ideas, but way too many glitches in simple situations. THe new variable speed option is a wonderful concept... but a simple slow motion effect is difficult to achieve now. There are lots of things that do not make sense. I hope there is an upgrade soon."
4,Very Nice Calendar,"I was looking for a good wall calendar for my office. I always enjoy nature calendars and this one is quite nice. It has pictures of different areas of Colorado from different seasons. Overall - its a great calendar for the office if you don't want to WRITE ON IT. For some reason when I tried to mark some ""days off"" on my calendar (I didn't press hard either) it came through on the next two pages (you could see lighter markings of those days off on the next two months). It also appeared a bit on the picture on the next page. IT wasn't DARK, but you could still see it. If you want a Calendar you can mark on try another calendar OR use a felt tip pen on this one (or gel tip). Just don't press hard."
1,A Poorly written book,"This is a very poorly written book. There are hundreds of spelling and grammatical errors. I can't believe a publisher actually printed this book, or that nobody with some education proofread it before it was published.The book seems to be a collection of drawings, extracts from other books or articles, and another book (perhaps in Farsi from the same author). It is a mix bag of disjointed short description of stories from Shahnameh (the legendary / mythical history of the ancient Iran) and the history of the Persian Empire. The pages, the stories, and the whole book do not flow together.I do not know that much about the subject itself, but I suspect that there are a lot of wrong information in the book as well."
3,Fine info but not enough!,"This is a nice attempt from the author, Mr Amini Sam, to portray the life and history of Aryans up to the Islam period 625 AD.For a more comprehensive look I recommend : A Concise History Of Iran by Saeed Shirazi - from early days to 2006!"
4,This game is cool !!!!!!!!,"This game is fun but a little hard. That's why I gave it 4 stars. Some parts you play as wolverine are very hard because so many guards attack you. The other reason I gave it 4, was because the movie parts are like a comic, not a movie. But overall I think its fun and cool. Playing as Nightcrawler is super fun because you can teleport behind guards and beat the living crap out of 'em. Plus, when you finish each level, you can upgrade your character's skill! You should try it . Its a cool game!!!!!!"
2,For hardcore X-Men fans ONLY. Watch X-Men beat up your spare time.,"Pros:There are X-Men in this game, Wolverine Iceman and Nightcrawler.Iceman's levels are pretty good (hence the 2 stars).The voices of the actors in the movie are used (which may have cost so much is explains the cons).Cons:Only 1 decent cutscene in the whole game, and all curscenes are drawn, like moving comic pages, like putting a comic in front of your face and impersonating an X-men character.Wolverine's levels are poor, he has about 4 different moves ONLY, and he's the worst part of the entire game. Nightcrawlers levels are just frustrating, and should not be played if you are tired of life in any way.There is no comparison between this game and class games like X-men Legends, they both begin with X, comparison abruptly ends.You may be thinking ""I love X-Men, I'm buying this anyway.""Buy & enjoy as much as possible, but you have been warned."
3,Informative but very dry,"I think this book is very thorough in discussing the issue of domestic violence in the South Asian immigrant community. I found it to be very interesting and informative. The personal interviews of victims made this issue very real. But I found the book overall to be very dry. It read more like something an academian would understand, not the general lay person."
1,Lame Game,"This is the kind of game that educators would love kids to love. Problem is, they don't.There are about 6 questions on each of about 200 cards, with the answers on the back. To their credit the cards are neatly held together and the answers are easily accessed. The problem is that either the child knows the answers and becomes bored, or doesn't, and loses interest (quickly). There is no 'game' here. There is no progressing towards an answer through work, no struggle, no problem solving, and no reward after getting the answer correct. A parent could provide these missing elements, or possibly the game could be modified by introducing betting, or creating markers and a racetrack, but that's not what is being offered.I think its a much better experience to sit with your child in front of a computer and explore together. More educational, more fun, and time well spent with your kids."
2,Hipocritical,"The book attempts to discuss the importance of multiculturalism within America's educational system, yet, the author's method of discussion throughout the book portrays biased and hipocritical views. The book intends to inform readers to stray away from prejudices and personal opinions, yet, the author seems to include his own prejudice views making his book hipocritical of the very point he attempts to conjure. He makes various comments throughout the book that disclose negative personal opinions upon current education within America's schools and educator's ""white"" methods of teaching. I agree with his claims on the need for educators to incorporate a more multicultural perspective in teaching, but he seems to boast more on his negative views and multicultural issues in education throughout the book, rather than including ideas and advice for educators on improving it."
4,Great buy!,The book was shipped fast and as it was said. I got it for my college course.The highlighted areas already helps me to study important areas. Thanks!
2,Cultural Diversity,"This book is very complicated, and not clear to the point. It also seems that the author has a very bias point of view."
5,great service,The book was in perfect condition and even with the hurrican I recieved my book in good time.
3,Like expected.,If you like Scottish Pipes this is a good selection. But be prepared to hear a lot of the same tones.
1,New Nexus Diametress,"I was a faithful user of the Old Diametress. I tried the New Diametress and after a whole bottle I've concluded that the New formula is not the same. I did not get the good results as I did with the Old Diametress. How disappointing. I cannot justify paying a premium for a product that performs no better that Suave or other off the shelf shampoo. If anyone finds a good replacement for the Old Diametress, please post the info for me and others to find. Thanks, JW, St Louis, MO."
3,No Better than Cheaper Brands,"After I read some of the reviews for this shampoo, I thought maybe it really would make my hair feel thicker and have more body. But I was so disappointed when I used it. I didn't find it did anything for my hair except clean it and give it a fresh smell. Those are good things, but I could have gotten them for a lot less money by using Suave."
3,Its ok..but probably not worth the price,This is a nice shampoo but I didn't notice any big improvements on my hair. Smells nice though..
5,helps thin hair,"We have been using Diamatress for years. It really helps to add volume to thin, fine hair. And this is the best price I could find. I will keep buying this product as long as they make it."
4,Good medium grade DVD-Rs,"I had heard that Velocity uses good medium grade DVDs in their 8x packages, and this turned out to be the case as I received discs that are made by Prodisc and are ""F01"" (ie Fuji dye).So, not top grade, but also not junky trash either, so a good buy for the price.Note that these do not have any labeling at all, the top is clear with no words at all."
3,Fine with me,"I burn about 8x for 10 discs, but the success is 80%. The problem isn't a burning failure; however, it is the currupt data when burning with 8x. I slow down to 4x and it is 100% success so far. I don't mind the problem with 8x because it is the cheapest in Amazon."
3,"cheap disc, but cheap price","Beware, these disc do work, BUT they are cheap, cheapily made. they are very prone to scratch. they do not have a writable topsurface(printable that is) but if all your using is a sharpie they will do the job, out of the 100 i coastered 10, but for 25 bucks for a 100 dvds..... still worth it. The velocity 8x printable surface dvds are far superior to these, just wish in the item description they would tell you what the top surface on these is."
5,Thought Provoking Work of Art,"I was drawn into the book the moment I opened it and didn't stop until I was done. I found the characters real, raw and vulnerable. This journey lead me to many physical places but the emotional places I encountered will stimulate my thougths for years to come. This is not a one time read. I find this a very giving book - I get something else out of it each time I read it."
1,Utter Crap,Terrible...just terrible. Its an improvised movie which in and of itself is a bad idea. When you improvise you should probably NOT repeat the same lines. This movie is just bad. Don't waste your time and money like I did. Shame on me.
2,"Light works fine, but you'll never find replacement bulbs!","I've had this light for a couple of years as a behind-the-monitor ambient light to lessen eye strain. It worked as a lamp should -- until the bulb went out. And there are ZERO sources for replacing this bulb. Sure, you can find 13 watt fluorescent desk lamps, but you WILL NOT find them in a four-prong linear arrangement.Okay lamp when it works."
2,"Poorly Constructed, Looks Cheap",The picture doesn't do this lamp justice. It actually looks much worse than it appears and the construction is flimsy. I have returned it to amazon.
5,THE BEST WAY FOR THE TAROT BEGINNERS,"As a tarot grandmaster in Jakarta-Indonesia it will be easy and usefull to me. To teach the very beginners in my country, which will bring my participants to close with tarot reading as a journey into self appraisel. As we know tarot reading in Indonesia is very new."
5,as cloce to right as you can get,you have to see them to understand. They are so close to the meanings it's great
4,Quick and Easy tarot Deck,The cards are good for beginning tarot students to learn the meaning of the cards.
4,great for beginners,"If you wish to do tarot readings, then this deck is an excellent way to start. The information on the cards is easy to read and helps you quickly discern relevant information in any spread you do for your readee. Nobody wants to spend months memorizing tarot card meanings or waste time flipping through some book. This is a fast and easy way to get to the point of each card."
2,"Misleading explanation, don't buy this.","The explanations in the cards are so irrelevant, at first I thought it's good for beginners, but it's not. Don't buy, it'll ruin your first experience of the Tarot."
2,Quick Tarot isn't as much fun,"As it turns out, having all the information on the cards was much less fun than having someone read and interpret their meanings."
5,Good Thing Arik Chose Music Over Cheese Sampling,"Arik Jenkins's premiere solo effort is well-written, well-played, but, unfortunately, well-hidden also. This fantabulous musical gem came with the efforts and blessings of such hardworking craftsmen as drummer Jimmy Johnson, guitarist George Wulf, and keyboardist Mike Dahl. With Mike Dahl in your corner, you can do no wrong!Highlights include ""Candy Walkin"", ""Breakfast In Bed"", and ""The Noisy Neighbors Reprise"". I like their response to the whole door-pounding, cheese block fiasco.Jenkins's band has been compared to a north-of-the-Mason/Dixon version of the Allmans, and for good reason. Harmonic vocals, effective chord structure, and solid rhythm provide titles that would make Dickie Betts proud."
3,sleeping bag,"i bought this bag because it was mummy shapped and rated for 0 degrees. it is extremley bulky...comes with a fleece sleeping bag liner...very warm and comfortable, but certainly not something you would want to carry on a trek."
2,Simply does not work on new Mac's,I have no doubt that at one time Final cut 4 was a great product. But beware to those that have new Mac's with Intel chips. This version simply does not work on them. I bought a brand new mac book pro with the intel chip and this program did not work. Luckily I did not spend that much and was able to get a refund. But if you have bought a new Mac you will need to look at getting newer software.
3,A so-so Viking movie,"This is an OK movie chronicling the trials and tribulations of a couple of Viking warriors marooned in the New World. The themes of this film are pertinent, such as the discovery of America, the Conflict of Cultures (European vs Native American), and the rise of Christianity coupled with the decline of paganism. The soundtrack is also pretty decent. Also, the scene of the Viking dude taking a dump in the woods is pretty unforgettable."
5,severed ways = awesome,"If you are into the ancient norse culture and the thought of the exploration and the glory that they achieved, then this movie is an awesome portrayal of what it would of been like for these two men who were stranded. Stranded out in the wilderness, thousands of miles away from their people, and their way of life. I cannot even start to imagine how they must have felt but they marched on with courage like my norse ancestors did. This movie is one of the most realistic glimpses into pagan viking culture and i love it!!!"
1,I Was Expecting Something Remotely Entertaining,"I had high hopes for this movie, especially with the black metal soundtrack, but upon execution, I found it unbearable to watch.Having to read the dialogue, translated from Norwegian is bad enough for what little dialogue there was, but that herky-jerky Cloverfield type camera style did nothing more that induce a migraine. Add to that the overlong scenes where nothing much happens (like chopping down trees), bleak atmosphere and bummer ending, I pretty much hated this thing. Maybe it's okay for the art film crowd, but for me, I watch movies to be entertained, not bummed out and sick.Cool music, though.Not recommended."
1,Waste of film and money,"I have a very extensive movie collection and find my opinions on most films match what most people have to say about movies I/they have seen. This movie however was rated pretty high and I must say that I have never been more disappointed in a movie as I was with this one. For starters it looked like a high school film class project that was filmed with a camcorder!! It contained little to no action and was extremely boring. I have read much on the vikings/norsemen and these guys hardly stack up to being as even remotely as rugged and vicious as the real thing. So to sum things up it's an extremely low-budget, inaccurate and boring waste of time and money. So, if you want any kind of entertainment on this type of subject I encourage you to look elsewhere."
5,SEVERED WAYS,"THIS VIDEO WAS SIMPLY AWESOME, VIKING STORY TELLING AT IT'S BEST, LEFT ON A ISLAND THESE 2 VIKING WARRIORS GET A SERIOUS LOOK INTO THEMSELVES AND THERE BELIEFS,SURROUNDED BY INDIANS WHO DO NOT WANT THEM THERE DOUBTING THERE PAGAN BELIEFS AND FRIENDSHIP THIS VIDEO [...]!"
1,"Great idea, horrible movie","This is obviously a film school homework project. It sounded like a decent movie, but the actual execution of it was horrible to say the least."
5,The Story is better then Pathfinder.,"Its a low budget film, so don't expect computer effects creating epic battle scenes. And the film is abit slow, but the quality of the story overcompensates it. I came out of watching pathfinder feeling it was a waist of my time, this movie wasn't."
1,Yuck!,"Morose movie, morose music and not anything like I anticipated. I would not recommend this movie to anyone - just skip right on over this one!"
5,Easy to install and very strong,I am an average do it yourselfer and asked my buddy to help me hold the tv in place while I placed it on the mount. The actual drilling in the stud and screwing the mount on took about 30 mins...Great product and all the necessary hardware was there...
5,Great item easy to install!,"This was a great purchase, easy to install and I loved the fact that all the hardware was already sorted for me, what a time saver! Would highly recommend!"
4,Great mount but not for Panasonic Plasmas...,"This is a well constructed, heavy duty wall mount that is easy to install. At 1 "" it is very low profile...too low however for the Panasonic TH-50PX600U. Although it comes with lots of hardware for stud or cement mounting, the screws that are provided to connect the brackets to the flat panel are not long enough for the spacers Sanus provides to add some depth/clearance. Do yourself a favor before you purchase this item.[..]"
4,Works great... with extra hardware for metal studs,"The mount was great for my TV, and a great price. But package doesn't include hardware for mounting to drywall with metal studs. For a couple bucks you can go to the hardware store and pick up 6 or 8 toggle bolts though, so not a major inconvenience. Very satisified otherwise."
4,mount for flat panel tv,Nice strong mount. Very adjustable. Easy to install. The price is much more reasonable than purchasing a mount from the store where you purchased the tv. I saved about 40% by buying it through Amazon. I would recommend this mount to anyone.
5,Very strong and solid,"After buying my lcd I was looking for a good mount but at best buy and circuit city they were very expensive, almost 200$ ( i don't know why).I order this mount sunday and it arrives on tuesday afternoon.I opened the package and I was very satisfied after finding out the quality of the mount.Very strong and solid.They provide you almost all kind of hardware to mount this on any kind of wall.No need for any instructions if you know how to hang a picture. I will recommend this to anyone who is going to wall mount a 40"" lcd tv. Thank you Amazon........."
5,Great mount,"Easy to install and mount a TV. Nice profile, low and close to the wall. I would recommend to anyone."
3,Did Not Live Up To My Expectations!,I own other crooked stile CD's and I listen to them on a regular basis but I was personally disappointed with this album.
3,Titanic Affair,"This was a decent short story. I liked the main characters, but i think they could have been fleshed out a little more. I would have liked to have more details on the ship itself. The ending was abrupt, so that could have been better thought out. But all in all I enjoyed this short read."
4,Surprisingly good spin on an old story.,"I am a bit of a Titanic buff and will read almost anything concerning the ship and disaster. I admit I was skeptical of this book but found it surprisingly enjoyable. It took a fresh spin on an old story and even threw in a bit of a mystery. The writing at times is amateurish, and a bit repetitive (everything seemed to look ""smart""). Some of the plot devices require a major suspension of belief (i.e., the side story of Carl's mother's ""miraculous"" cure). But the plot itself overcomes most of the faults. It is generally a fun, engaging read and not to be taken as serious literature, but still enjoyable."
4,For Titanic Buffs,"""Titanic Affair"" is a novel aimed at Titanic buffs. ""Titanic Affair"" is just one novel in a long line of novels that take a historical event and fashion a fictional tale around the event. Take ""Raise the Titanic"" for instance. ""Titanic Affair"" is not bad as novels go and there is enough historical drama present to make most Titanic buffs take note."
3,Happy diversion,"I've been on a Titanic kick lately and found this on Pixel of Ink as a free read. I'm reading another Titanic book right now so this book might have gotten a good bump because the other was so terrible, but I don't think that's the case.It's a nice light read that gets the facts straight (that's the bump), but there are quite a few typos. All the words meant what the author thought they meant so bonus! The typos were easily overlooked to get to the good story underneath. There were a few moments of stretched disbelief and the bad guy was too stupid to live, but the heroine wasn't so definitely worth the time. Entertaining and enjoyable read."
4,POP IT ON ME,VERY GOOD CDPOP IT ON ME IS THE SINGLE FROM THE CDBOOSIE -- i think you are going placesfree mac and c-murder
3,this album's alright,"this album is alright, i might recommend it to a few people, boosie normally has some nice beats, on here, i dont know what happened, he has a few bangin beats, but he isn't consistant with the ability to drop fire on this cd like he has with his others, i say 3 stars on the doc, take your chances with buying this cd, if you don't like it, you cant blame me for why you don't because i ain't recommending it, nor am i saying don't go get it, it's a 50/50"
5,One Great and Original Album,"I have never ever heard this type of music before. It is whiskey influenced, high octane, honky-tonk, psychobilly music with progressive liberal themes and lyrics. Some of the best guitar hooks I have ever heard and some of my favorite vocals ever. ""Out There"" ranks for me, one of the ten greatest songs ever, and it is just one of many great songs. If you are into Mike Ness and the Old 97s, I think you will like this. Sad that they are no longer together, but they do have a great website."
2,Out of Ideas,I bought their first album and enjoyed it. This follow up is OK to listen to but the songs don't pop like they did on the first release. Forgettable.
2,Beware of this CD,There are a lot of bands right now mixing country with garage. The Hangdogs are not one of the best. Weak songs sung by a vocalist who sounds likes dozens of other singers. There is just not much new going on here--nothing to distinguish this band from others in the same genre.
1,Horrible Design,After a few months of use the rubber ear pads came loose. They would often to pop off and I'd have to scramble to find them. Eventually I lost one. Radio Shack or Best Buy don't have replacement pads. Sony's parts department will replace one of the pads for $7.00 plus shipping and handling. So the pads themselves cost exactly half of the price of the headphone. Whoever designed these headphones wasn't thinking.
4,"Reasonably Good, found replacement earbud covers!","I bought a set about a year ago and the left earbud suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason (~10 months of usage). I purchased another set as they are cheap enough and when working correctly produce pretty nice sound. Hopefully this set will last a while longer.Also I lost one of the earbud covers while vacationing in NZ and thought that I would have to replace the entire set on my return to the states. However, on my return flight to India (where I was working at the time)I went through the Singapore International Airport and in one of the shops I found replacement covers from Audio-Technica (ER-CK5s for the small cover replacements, package of 6). I have not been able to find these in the states, but perhaps you can have them shipped here."
3,Just to clarify something...,"I just wanted to clarify the thing people are saying about one of the cords being a lot shorter than the other. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THIS WAY. They are designed like this so that you can put the shorter cord across the back of your neck. This does 2 things. 1. it takes a little bit of the weight off the main cord, and that helps the headphones stay in your ears. 2. The short cord is nice if you like to keep the headphones around your neck when you're not using them. I hope this helps clear up some of the confusion out there."
3,"Great sound, okay fit","These headphones have great sound quality. However, they just don't fit that well. I've tried all 3 sizes of ear buds that come with them and they still don't fit well. The left ear bud wire is shorter than the right, meaning I need to carry or wear my ipod on the left side...which just doesn't work for me. and since the left wire is so short, it constantly is being pulled while running or exercising, so it always falls out of my ear. If you're looking for headphones to use while just relaxing and listening to music, these are great. If you're wanting something to wear while running/exercising, I wouldn't recommend these."
3,Sound is good but quality is suspect!,I have had these headphones for less than 6 months and one of the buds has already developed a short and finally quit. I use them approximately twice a week while at work doing computations. I was very careful with them so I can only assume it was a faulty one. Luck of the draw. My son has one and he uses it everyday and is pretty rough with it and it still works! Go figure!
2,OK for a while,"I thought the sound quality while they lasted was pretty good but I had the same issue as a previous reveiwer when the left bud went dead all of a sudden.These, too, were to replace the included phones with my ipod. (which also left bud went dead in a week.) The Sony's at least lastes a few months."
4,"Good Price, Great Quality","I just resently got these headphones and I love them. I am so used to in-ear headphones falling out of my ears but these fit perfectly. The sound is great and they go behind your head which is good. The only downer is the unever cord, but it isn't a real big deal."
2,good if like buying new headphones every 6 months,"Great sound for the price, good bass, and comfortable to wear. Sounds like a good deal until you realize why they're so inexpensive. The rubber surrounding the headphone wires just deteriorates after a couple of months. At first it was just a couple of openings and I figured it was because of misuse, but the deterioration got to the point where the entire rubber casing just totally came apart. Had to throw them away because they simply stopped working. I didn't listen to the reviews which stated the same thing, and now I'm paying the price.Not worth it in the long run, currently trying to find a replacement pair of headphones."
