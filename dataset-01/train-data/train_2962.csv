2,Not his best....,"I read a review earlier where Swardson was called a hack and I felt I needed to apologize to that reviewer to a certain extent. The reviewer called Swardson a hack and kind of have to agree that some of the stuff on this Dvd ive def seen done by other comedians(Pablo Francisco). I cringed when i saw the similarities as i am a big Swardson fan, but he totally ripped off Pablo on a few of these bits... On top of that, a lot of the jokes were not the LOL funny ive come to expect from Nick. There are 2 or 3 bits in the Dvd that are really hilarious but most of the stuff on the dvd just plain bomb. Maybe its just me Idk... I hope his next special has the kind of material Swardson is capable of producing."
2,Is he copying Dane Cook and Russell Peters?,"I don't know what you call a comedian who copies the style of other comedians. Is that called a hack?Throughout his routine, I felt like there were similar things from Dane Cook and Russell Peters routines.His drinking and drug related humour was not funny and his promotion of his movies was not appreciated.He was not funny in this standup routine."
2,Listening for faults,"I enjoy Chopin but the sound quality of this CD is poor compared to other piano / classical CDs I own. Certain notes have a buzzing sound that I have learned to listen for. Track 3, Nocturne suffers from it and other selections suffer as well. These Chopin pieces were recorded in the 1980's - maybe the early 1980's digital recording technology doesn't match today's standards."
2,nice try,"Carol Brugge's novel is rathe rthin on period details-geography, customs and most of all language-the diction has a very modern feel. It is my contention that the cover blurb from Mr Kaye was prompted by friendship(?) with the author more than any merit in the book itself"
3,A decent effort but the plot is weak and predictable,"An adequate, unremarkable imitation of a Sherlock Holmes novel. It's a decent effort - a nice inoffensive story that serves to pass the time - but the end result isn't up to the standards set by the original works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.This is the first Sherlock Holmes novel I've ever read where I was able to figure out the majority of the mystery long before Holmes did. I'd like to think it's because I am so much wiser as I enter into middle age than I ever was as a bright eyed youth devouring the adventures of Holmes and Dr. Watson... I'd like to think that but reality - in the form of a weak and predictable plot - prevents me from it."
2,dont waste your time,this book sucked. holmes is a caricature of what a detective should be. the whole story is a waste of paper
5,One of my MOST favorite albums,"This Time Through is one of my MOST favorite albums of all time. The sound was just what I needed after getting saved and leaving the world's music. The lyrics were very moving for me and still tug on my heart to this day. It saddens me to hear Dana has passed on, but very happy for him to finish the race he was destined to win. He was just a poor wayfaring stranger."
4,Tenchi Muyo! GXP: Galaxy Police Transporter,well it was better than some people put it out to be i liked it but it ended kind of wierd it kind of left you hanging for a sequel but the sequel might be a little better of some points the set is mad for the younger age i do recomend it for some younger class even though it has some points where the adult class might like frown on. but it was good and i recommend it to everyone who is a anime fan
3,"How about a revised edition, please!","I was so excited to have a chance to finally learn how to put together a demo package to send to publishers, producers, etc. When I received my book, I was disappointed to find that it was published in 1994, so I hardly think the information is up to date. The author begins by informing the reader that the industry standard of submission is a demo cassette tape. Yeah, right! Even if that were true, how on earth could that information be trusted seven years later. Some of the information is helpful, like putting together a promotional package or contacting A&R people and such. Mostly, however, I feel rooked because I bought something that is completely outdated. My advise to the consumer--wait for the updated version."
3,"Light, enjoyable read 3-1/2 stars","Orphans Preferred by Christopher Corbett is a fun history of The Pony Express. Corbett does his best to piece through the mythology of the ""Pony"", but he doesn't always have a lot to work with. Sometimes he spends pages explaining all the different possibilities of a fact which isn't all that important. There are neat, short biographies of some fascinating characters from the Wild West including Buffalo Bill Cody and Wild Bill Hickock. Corbett treats the whole book as fun and not to be taken too seriously, and that's exactly how I suggest you read the book. He does his best to give us the facts, but sometimes the legend is more interesting, so he recounts that as well. I have a new understanding of The Pony Express and some of the people who helped create its myth, but many mysteries remain, including the ""orphans preferred"" newspaper advertisement."
2,Editor needed,"I read this through, but it was painful. There is a lot of interesting material to work with. (Having lived in Wyoming, I like frontier history.) But oh, my, the lack of organization. A good editor would have insisted on better organization and the omission of one repetition after another. The problem is best summed up in the author's own words discussing someone else's book on the subject: ""Much of the book has nothing to do with the Pony Express."" And elsewhere he writes, ""In the end, no one would be entirely certain what was true and what was not true. . . In the end, it no longer mattered."" It apparently doesn't matter to the author, but it does matter to us. This story would have made a great article series, perhaps three articles. But it has been too much padded in order to make it book length, and the truth vs legend aspect is lost in the padding."
4,Facts Separated From Myth,"The first chapter of ""Orphans Preferred"" cleverly drives home what seems to be the central point of the book: it's extremely difficult, if not impossible, to separate the ""true"" Pony Express from the Pony Express of our American mythology. As daunting as this task is, Corbett, on balance, does an excellent job of presenting what facts are available, as well as describing the myths of the Pony Express with good humor instead of the self-righteous outrage many authors would stoop to. The result is a fascinating book that informs and entertains. Some may call what Corbett does in ""Orphans Preferred"" revisionist history (the term even turns up in the book's dust jacket). I feel that this is unfair, as ""revisionist history"" suggests twisting history to a particular (usually political) agenda. Corbett does just the opposite by objecively presenting the facts and the myths regarding the brief but fascinating history of the Pony Express."
2,A very windy author...,"This book really was a let down. The author just can't seem to get to the point. Trivial history continually draws away from the story. I can't recommend you buy this book, let alone take the time to read it."
1,Absolute Hogwash!,"Were it possible to give less than one star, I certainly would. The author lost my faith in his introduction when he ""debunked"" the story of each Pony Express rider being issued a Bible by pointing out that a Bible would be difficult to read while on a galloping horse.Had he put any thought into what he was writing, he might have realized riders were NOT in the saddle 24/7, that there was much ""down time"" spent at lonely way stations and plenty of time for reading the Bible or the labels on cans of peaches or whatever other material was at hand.When an author writes without thinking, he completely loses my trust. No wonder used copies are selling for eighty cents - overpriced even at that amount."
4,stain solution,"during the episode holly stains Heidi's bag she says its ruined it's not. Here's the link for removing stains from leather [...], have fun"
5,The Hills Session 5,"Loved it! Probably the best so far (although it focuses ALOT on spencer and heidi - who I aboslutely LOVE!), great ending, so excited to see Kristen back (massive Laguna fan too!)Can't wait for Session 6 to FINALLY be released!"
5,A must ad to your collection,Bought this and loved it soooo much. You will not be sorry. Great information in the liner notes as well. This CD is a must buy.
5,Best book for Chinese New Year!,"I've been reading this story to Preschoolers, Kindergartners, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th graders for three years now. It is a hit everytime. It is a good version of how the animal zodiac came to be without any religious theme which makes the public school system happy."
4,I got what I wanted,"The CD was just fine. The CD case hinge was partialy broken,but no big deal - it may have happened in mailing"
5,Amazing!,"Great book, quick shipping, you can't lose! I definitely recommend this to fellow Christians who like a good read. This is a life changing book"
5,Magnificent!,"Eric Metaxes really gives what I would call an excellent take on a really honest, brilliant man who developed a great relationship with the living God over his short lifetime."
3,modern french course,"a good book for an english speaker who is enthusiastic about french, yet is not able to attend a formal course. treads a fine line between the practical motivations to learn the language, provision of sufficiently comprehensive french grammar support and constant revision so as to capitalise on past efforts on the book. the book is slightly weak on the verbal front due to the excessive effort required to become comfortable with its verbal dictionary. i would probably have given it a 5 star if a good audio cassette accompanied this book."
2,"Good Design, Poor Fabric and Finish","Although ""The First Years 5 in 1 Carry Me Near Sleep System"" isn't washable, overall, I didn't have a problem with the design, but unfortunately, the quality of the fabric and the poor craftsmanship warranted my returning it. Regarding the craftsmanship, in my opinion, the quality of the sewing and stitching is way below grade, and the absense of bar tacks is a clear sign of cost cutting. If you're looking for a heirloom piece, The First Years 5 in 1 Carry Me Near Sleep System isn't for you, for sure."
2,saggy mattress,"This bassinet is useful for a newborn, as we could take our baby from room to room, but I wish the mattress was sturdier. You can see the dent in our baby's head makes daily. What's worse is that when the bassinet basket is placed on the stand, as in the pictures, the mattress and frame dip in the middle. It's built w/o a sturdy bottom so that it can be converted into a seat for older babies and is a major construction flaw, in my opinion. It helps to place the bassinet basket on a flat surface like the couch or floor, but then we can't wheel it it around."
3,Beautiful but not functional,We loved the bassinet from an aesthetic perspective unfortunately our daughter hated it. I think it's too deep and she can't see through the sides or over the brim so panics every time we place her in it. We're sad to put this in the basement but hope a baby in our future will enjoy it more.
4,Seems good,"Havent used for baby yet, will update with more useful review.There were NO instructions that came with the bassinet, took me way longer to put together than it should have. I also recommend getting a different mattress, the one that comes with the bassinet is JUNK. I reused my old bassinet mattress, which is way better than the flimsy piece this came with."
2,THEY RESELL DEFECTIVE BASSINET!!,"This baby is coming in three days. We put it together today and it took two hours. Then, the vibration/light, etc doesn't work!!!! AND, I didn't get the extra sheet that the other reviewers are talking about. On top of that, one of the side buckles is broken, so it won't hold the bassinet down. Did I get someone's reject bassinet?? I think so!DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT - THEY RESELL DEFECTIVE BASSINETS!!"
3,Would not recommend,"This is a beautiful bassinet. That seems to be the only good thing I have to say about this item.Here are my beefs:It is heavyPainful to assembleThe placement of the light is poor, it shines right in your eyesThe vibration or music does not stay on (automatic shut off, perhaps I missed this when picking it)You have to take it apart if you have to wash the cover for the changing table partThe incline sits the baby up, so baby must be supported on each side"
4,Good Bassinet,"My daughter comfortably slept in this for 12 weeks before we had to move her to something larger because she liked to sleep sideways. At the time, we were living in a small space waiting for our house to be built and it was a great spacesaver. We used the changing table portion for her sponge baths and it worked great. The bottom storage was her laundry basket. We never carried around the bassinet portion, it's a bit too bulky. Overall, I would recommend this, especially to those in small spaces."
5,ABSOLUTE BEST PRODUCT OUT THERE!,"This bassinet has been a lifesaver for our household! The ease of portability has been a dream. The changing table feature right there anytime we need it. Baby loves her little light, music and vibrations. Storage basket in bottom is perfect size for numerous diapers, outfits, blankets, etc...If you can only buy one baby item - buy this one!"
1,Electronics system does not work,I put this bassinette together and was so excited to hear the different sounds and check out the night light. Well it never worked. I checked and re-checked the batteries and it just does not work. I am going to call the customer care center tomorrow. It is SO frustrating. If I have to send this back it will be such a PAIN. My baby is due in two weeks so I just know I won't have a new one in time. Everything else is fine with it. It was easy to assemble.
4,Great for Baby with cold,"My 2 month old got a cold (from my 2 year old) and had trouble with a stuffy nose and coughing. I was able to prop the back up like you normally would for play time, then put the seat in the base (probably not recommended by the manufacturer but it was very sturdy), and then rock him. He slept so much better that way. I just wish that the material was a little nicer all around. Also I think that the quietest setting for the music is a little loud for baby's ears. Otherwise, great bassinet."
2,"Flimsy, music do not work","Well, I was expecting to get 5 in one for price of one... had to return the item.... Flimsy construction and music and vibration do not work, moreover, all fabrics is 100 polyester, smells like factory and it is not possible to remove for washing..."
2,saggy bottom,"I bought this item because of all the good reviews, now I wondering if I should trust any of the amazon reviews anymore...It is so obvious that the bassinet bottom was made of 3 pieces, very saggy like a piece of crap... Where baby sleeps has to be hard and flat,that is the only thing important for a bassinet."
4,Natures Peace,I was nervous about ordering it becasue the reviews were mixed but I am happy to report that everything went fine. The instructions are not the best but it was very easy to figure it out.I love it and can't wait for my little princess to arrive.My only complaint is that the vibrating function is broken!! Other than that everything was great!
4,Looks great!!,"So far I haven't used the bassinet, I will have my baby in a few days, but I am very pleased with the quality and looks of the bassinet. I thought it was easy enough to put together, (read the directions carefully though) and I think that when mattress pad is in it, it doesn't feel like it will be uncomfortable at all, like one of the reviews have suggested. All of the features seem great, although i'll know better when I start using it.I would definately reccomend this bassinet."
2,Could be safer,"I got this as a gift, and wouldn't purchase it again. First, it has straps to strap the baby in place that are extremely difficult to use if baby is swaddled (and most babies are). Second, there is mesh only at the very top of the bassinet, so I constantly need to reposition my baby. If this product had mesh all the way around the bassinet, it would get a much higher rating."
5,Perfect!,The last reviewer really nailed it. I love this sleep system! The picture really doesn't do it justice because its actually a really pretty light cream color. My fiance had it put together in less than 30 minutes and everything works just fine and is VERY sturdy. I was kind of disappointed that batteries did not come with it. It will be perfect for my son who is due in February.
3,"Useful, but there are some drawbacks","Pros: Like the nightlight, the storage underneath, the canopy (can be pushed down), the mobile items can be removed, the color is nice, the maneuverability (is one wheels and can be moved up and down to match the height of your bed), like the venting on the topCons: The seam in the middle of the mattress gets bent when you transport the bassinet in the closed position therefore making a indentation in the mattress when in use. My baby often slid into the indentation when sleeping."
4,"You probably won't need all ""5 uses""","So far, my one month old likes this, but we only use the portable sleeper, and bassinet portion of it. I never used the co-sleeper, or the changing table, which if you use it as a bassinet, you can't also use it as a changing table unless you feel like lifting the bassinet up each and every time. Play seat??It's great for the price though, and easy to put together, plus the decor is neutral, which is always a plus.**You may want to purchase a waterproof pad and get receiving blacnkets and put that over the cushion of the bassinet, as any wetness immediately goes through the whole thing."
2,Impossible to Clean,"I got this bassinet as a hand-me-down gift. Although it has really great features (night light, vibrations, compact size for travel, etc.) None of the linens are removable for cleaning. This is really dumb, because newborns and infants are known for spitting up, diaper blow-outs, etc. If any mess gets on the linens, the only way to clean it is to give it a dunk and scrub in the bathtub, all along being careful not to get the electronics in the handle soaked. I am very disappointed that the designers of this product did not make the linens removable for machine washing.I am glad this is not a product that I had purchased. Had I purchased it, I would have sent it back. I do not recommend this bassinet."
2,lindsey dunn,"this item was purchased for a new baby - it obviously was purchased before and returned, repackaged and sent out again..several screws, brackets were missing - it was returned to babies r-us in tustin, california, which was unnecessary.. if it had been checked prior to shipment the first time."
1,returning it,"Bought it, assembled it, decided it was a piece of crap, disassembled it, put in for a return. The mattress pad is SIDS scary, but if that's not enough, it's just such a cheap piece of junk. Don't know what I'm going to replace it with yet, but I'm not putting my kid in that thing."
4,Love this item,"Pros:- Plays Beethoven and other soothing sounds including heartbeat- Rocks back and forth easily.- Has hanging toys to entertain the baby.- It's easy (though can be heavy with the baby in it) to carry. Especially in the beginning when the baby sleeps a lot. I had him in the bassinett in the living room during the day and put him on the stand at night.- Lots of storage space underneath.Cons:- Unable to remove fabric for washing.- The vibrations seemed too harsh for me, so I didn't use it for my baby.- I didn't like the mattress so I bought my own and replaced it. (It does fit a standard size bassinett mattress)- The changing table was pretty much useless."
5,This is the best baby item!!!!!!,"I love this item.I have two month old twins and I could not live without this bassinet.My babies just love it!I take turns putting them in it.I have a play yard with a bassinet also,neither will sleep in that,They love the sounds especially the birds.The vibrator works great for naptime.It is so easy to move and I love that the seat also sits up for baby to look around and play.I keep it downstairs for naps and playtime.With two babies this bassinet has been a lifesaver."
5,Loved this product,"We bought this for our third child and I love the versatility and options. Everything was on the handle and portable - not on the base like many bassinets or portable cribs with bassinet. Other friends have borrowed it as well and loved it. I recommend it to many deciding between co-sleepers, bassinets."
1,Hated It,"This unit did not seem sturdy at all. I did not like the Velcro (SP) main support system or the thin legs that stabilizes this bassinet. I do have a 70 lb yellow lab and I was somewhat scared that he was going to knock it over (even on the lowest setting). For petless parents, this bassinet would probably work. But I returned it for a Graco."
2,"DId not work, hard to clean","The first years does not make any extra sheets for this bassinet, so if your baby soil it or spits up, you have to immediately wash the one pad that is included before it can be used again. Our baby has not come yet, but my mother (who bought us this bassinet as a gift) was VERY disappointed, as she well remembers changes sheets two or three times a day.Also, the electronics for this item did not work from day one--test them before going to the trouble of assembling the whole thing!"
3,"Like height, but too wide and wheels don't roll","ROCKINGAfter a month of using it, we finally put the wheels up and used the rocking function. We were worried one of the older brothers would rock it over, but it will not tip, due to it's...WIDE BASEWe love the height of our bassinet, but to stabilize it, they had to make the base so wide that it doesn't fit through our bedroom doorway.WHEELSThe wheels are extremely cheap and don't roll well (when they do) on the hardwood and don't roll at all on the rugs.SOUNDS/VIBRATIONWe like that there is a +/- for volume and vibration. The music sound is a bit cheezy, but we like the rain sound for a little white noise.One extra word of warning, my mom bought us a fitted mattress pad that said it could be used with this bassinet, but the sheet won't fit over it and it doesn't have holes cut out for the buckles. Check before buying a sheet for this if you will be using the buckle!"
3,It's a decent co-sleeper,"I would have given this product 4 stars instead of 3 but here are the reasons why i didn't1) The assembly instructions are not that clear, basic pictorial guide and less detailed instructions in the guide, so i ended spending some time to get it assembled.2) The wheels are only ok and sometimes get stuck.Pros:1) The final assembled product looks very good and the quality of the fabric is good.2) The sleep light, various sound tones, hanging toys,vibrator mode and the quality of the speaker is good.3) The 'rocking' mode is designed well and the baby really likes it."
4,This bassinet does it all!,"I just love this bassinet for many reasons, and I don't even use half of the features. The night light is wonderful, although my bulb blew out after just 4 weeks of use (easy to replace, but very inconvenient). The canopy is extremely useful when trying to put down a fussy little one. I have not had any problems with the changing table sagging, although I do not use it regularly.There are a few shortcomings to this bassinet. The pad is not very supportive, so I purchased a bassinet pad/mattress for some real support. The fabric is not removable for washing (or ironing), but can easily be cleaned with some Shout wipes if needed.I still think this bassinet is fantastic, and loaded with features. Great value for the price, and my son loves sleeping in it."
1,Beware of doorways,"We were given this bassinet as a gift and after we had it assembled, discovered that it does not fit through a standard doorway. The bassinet had to be angled and was a complete hassle if you are going to move it around the house.Maybe new houses have wider doorways, but it didn't fit throught ours."
4,Found the bad reviews to be wrong,I am currently pregnant with our 2 child. I have less then a month to go until my due date and I found this to be easy to put together by myself with only a toddler to help me. I can not comment on how the baby sleeps in it yet but I found it to be built more stable then some reviews made it seem. So far I'm happy with the product. I don't think we will be able to use it long but we only want it until the baby is on a schedule. Shipping was very fast.
1,The mattress is terrible,First I loved how it looked and seemed so cozy .then I purchased and as I was putting things together I noticed the mattress is so bad and curvy it needs to be hard and stiff for the baby's bones to grow healthy.to conclude the baby's bed /mattress ruined the whole bassinett.so I advise not buying it
2,Didn't get good use out of this,My son only slept in this when we took him into the living room in the carrier. He would cry and cry even when we used the vibrating or music feature. Be careful b/c you will trip on the legs! Just put your baby in the crib don't waste extra money on a bassinet!
1,Disappointing purchase,"I purchased this bassinett for my baby and I am very disappointed. My main complaint is that I bought it to replace another bassinett, because this one rocked and had a built-in night light. Well, we took the time to put it together, and guess what???? The light, music and vibration do not work AT ALL !!!! Very annoying! I am also very disturbed by the fact that the bassinett is not attached to the base. This seems very dangerous and I am surprised it is designed this way. Considering that it was one of the more expensive bassinetts on sale, a very disappointing purchase. I would return it, but I am in Bermuda. Would think twice before buying another of their products."
4,Very nice.,"I like this bassinet. I find that the ruffles, though pretty, make it hard to find what you're looking for in the storage basket underneath. I also wish there were more music options (there are several sounds, but only one song, ""Fur Elise"".) I don't use the changing table myself, but my husband does, and given his propensity for messy accidents during diaper changes, I'm glad he likes it! I usually just change the baby on the bed, since I'm too lazy to move the bassinet in order to use the table."
4,Very nice for the price,"I've had this bassinet for about 4 months now and I like it. It was easy to put together. I suggest ordering the ""Inclined to Sleep"" product from ""summer"" as it fit's well in the bassinet and really helped my baby sleep during her first month. Inclined to Sleep Positioner"
1,"Perfect, except for one fatal flaw","I love this bassinet. In fact, we had the same one for our daughter 4 years ago, and it was the one thing we couldn't live without. Great functionality, and we took it everywhere with us. Well, for our son, of course we bought another one. It is a great product, BUT, it has advertising stickers on the carry handle which will not come off. I guess we could use a chemical sticker remover, but who wants chemicals on something for a newborn. So pretty much, it is a great product that looks like garbage because some marketing person decided to put huge, permanent, stickers on it. Amazing how easy it is for them to ruin what was once a great product."
3,"good on the RAF, not so good on the AVG","What the good professor has done here is sit down and read all the published accounts of the AVG and the RAF in Southeast Asia, then tell the story through the eyes of the participants. He's especially interesting on the British side, since the RAF's accomplishments in the Pacific haven't received much attention from historians. If you don't know anything about the Flying Tigers, this might suggest the books you ought to read, and if you've read them all, this is a helpful review--though the author tends to give all sources equal weight, and (sometimes for that reason) he gets some of the facts wrong."
1,UGLY,The glasses I received don't look like the picture! They are really tight on my head (and I have a fairly small head) and are not at all attractive. I tried them on and then immediately gave them away. What a waste!
4,Fabulous players + great songs = high energy disc!,"Warning: this disc is intense and may take several listens before sinking in.""Mad March"" is an upbeat rocker with a repetitive dual guitar line that produces a very cool swirling effect that words can't explain. ""Meetings"" a vibrant tune has some great solo work. In parts, ""Herd Instinct"" sounds vaguely similar to a Dregs tune. ""Bloomsday"" starts heavy but thins out from too much repetition. ""Old Meat Frame"", the only vocal tune on the disc, is sort of a rappish alternative rock tune. ""Memento Mori"" another great tune is filled with intriguing changes. ""Qubit"" is strange. ""Government"" is another upbeat rock/jazz/prog blend of goodies. Finally, ""Resonate"" is a mid-tempo jazzy tune.Recommend for Dregs and Keneally fans."
2,Only the basics,"I found this book to be very basic and not worth the high price. It was recommended for a graduate level business course, which I think was not appropriate. If you are new to writing reports (high school or early college), this might be written to your level of experience. However, even in my undergrad studies, I used other writing and presentation books that seemed to have much more valuable content. One example is the presentation chapter which starts at the absolute basics for creating a PowerPoint presentation. The average working professional should know this basic information after using PowerPoint only a couple times."
2,Who Writes these reviews?,"I should have saved my money. This book basically has the same content as the manual that comes with the software. Yes, it is a little better organized, but there is really no more information in it that in the manual.Also, if you are looking for a book for photo retouching and repair, this is not it. It tells you how to use the basic tools, but there are not clear examples of true ""restorations"" and how they got from one point to another.I am a very computer literate person, and I found this book annoying, the same as the manual. I have learned a lot more by trial and error."
3,Not very detailed. Disappointing coming from Adobe,Pretty general and only has 13 lessons. Not something to buy as a reference book.
4,Looking to learn PhotoShop 5? This is the book !,If you are looking to learn Photoshop 5 or if you are going to upgrade to photoshop 5 you should read this book. The book will get you up and going fast with photoshop. The books was made with great detail and I think every photoshop users should have a copy
2,"Good book, but why Image Ready?","This is a good book for beginners, and if you already know how to work with layers try some other books (""Photoshop 5 Artistry"" is my suggestion). One irritating thing is extensive coverage of Image Ready program -- after spending around $600 for full version or $190 for an upgrade of Photoshop a very few people will be willing to spend another $200 for Image Ready (which in my opinion is only a mediocre product). ""Adobe Photoshop 4 Classroom in a Book"" was a better book with much superior page layout than the present (version 5) edition."
1,Good for norvice.,If you're a beginner this is a great book! But I've considered myself as an Int. and learnt NOTHING from this book so if you are not a beginner do not buy this book! get Inside Adobe Photoshop 5 instead
2,Short and not too sweet.,"I bought this as one of a few required texts in a Photoshop course. Its okay but it is rather brief. It covers basic methods but I liked other books that had more depth and a more upbeat tone. Something depressing about this one (or maybe I'm just depressed about paying half a hundred bucks for it?). This book is useful but flipping through it, there is an awful lot of dead space, and even though it is useful other books can easily be substituted that provide better coverage or cost less."
4,Good for beginners,"This book is excellent for beginners (as is the 6.x version). It's chock full of tutorials. I wouldn't recomend it for the advanced user, however. I believe that the ""Bible"" series is appropriate for more advanced users."
1,"Boring, over-rated, expensive.","I really didn't like using this book. It didn't hold my interest and the lessons were dry. Parts of the book are already available in the program. So, why is it so expensive?"
2,Lacks the depth of version 3 and 4 Classroom in a Book,"I use this book as a manual for a 3 day Photoshop class, and for the first time I'm dissapointed with Adobe Press.They saw fit to remove all discussion but a partial page on resolution, one of the most important and difficult topics for a novice to understand. In previous versions excellent examples had been used to discuss this. But this version sacrifices knowledge to further sales by adding chapters on ImageReady. Unfortunately, the rest of the book also misses the mark in many areas. Some examples are poor and would never be done that way in a real world setting. Some chapters completely miss the mark. Version 3 was in depth and had great examples, Version 4 perfected some of that while only sacrificing a solid example of the Pen Tools usage. Too bad Adobe went downhill from there with this version."
1,Well the book has nice thick paper,There is a lot of SPACE in this book. And not too many TECHNIQUES. It's not a bad book. But it is really really overpriced and overrated.
4,Three great stories,"Three stories by three talented romance authors! The first is by Kathryn Fox, ""Irish Roses"", is a fairy tale come true. The second is by Candace McCarthy, ""The Bride Price"", is full of honor, tradition, and romance that will melt even the iciest of hearts! The third is by Jean Wilson, ""Irish Wildfire"", is a patriot female who kidnaps an English gentleman for a magical harp.You will not be able to rush through these enchanting stories! Each will strike you in a different way and hold onto you long after you finish the novel."
3,Irish Enchantment....,"Three Irish Historical Romance stories.Kathryn Fox's Irish Roses was the best-5 stars.Candace McCarthy's story was not good, I quit it forty pages from the end.Jean Wilson's story was very good at first but the heroine turned a bit ""TSTL"" at the end, so I give it 3 stars.Overall, I give Irish Enchantment 3 stars."
4,"Comfy, neat looking, different, but color is off !",I fell in love when I saw the picture and the price is great. ($42 here vs. $89 on Zappos) Good shipping/processing time- arrived in 4 business days. I was very surprised by the color- nothing like pictured- deep tan I expected brown- these are kinda yellowish- weird. (Is that why they're on sale?) Strange color. But they are comfy. I wear 7 1/2 or 8 and I tried them on with low cut thin socks and they're kind of loose. With thicker socks they fit tighter. Great look aside from the color and I do think they'll be comfortable. I'm looking forward to winter! :)
4,Recommended,"This anthology of short stories is a brilliantly selected set of works. I was introduced to this novel because it was a required text for Rogers-sensei's Japanese Literature class. I opened the novel and was immediately intrigued; for every short story, Rogers includes an introduction that is very helpful in understanding the text. Rogers includes well-known authors such as Kawabata Yasunari and Ihara Saikaku, but also some pretty amazing writers I have never heard of. My favorite translation is Mishima Yukio's ""Fountains in the Rain."" I heartily recommend this short anthology to anyone interested in understanding Japanese culture through literary works."
3,Comfy Slippers,these slippers are cushy and very comfortable. The problem with them is they make your feet a bit sweaty.
5,It's full of inspiration,"If you are like me, you look at these layouts to get ideas, but never EXACTLY duplicate what I'm shown. This book is jam-packed with good ideas that are practical and tasteful. Nothing too wild, nothing too expensive or too difficult to reproduce with the supplies most scrapbookers already have or can find at an ordinary craft store. I highly recommend it for someone who wants to start a baby-oriented album."
4,great ideas,This book is full of great scrapbook ideas for my baby's scrapbook! I would have given it 5 stars if it had more pages of simple samples.
1,dont waste your money,"the stuff in this book is so dated, dont waste your money. You are better off just surfing the various web sites where people post their pages."
3,"Not A Book That Praises Mary, Mother of God and Guide to Jesus","This book is interested only in proving how Marian devotion is a displacement/replacement for the worship of Isis, Ishtar, Innana and Cybele (it's not) and NOT a clear portrait of Mary per se.True, the pictures are lush, but are presented in a context that depicts the devoted as superstitious oafs from backwater kindergartens.I was personally shocked by the amount of adornment afforded the icons. They are STATUES not persons. The hyperactive reverence given the icons themselves is, in my opinion, idolatry. I understand the icon as a guide to prayer... but the lavish icons depicted here are nothing if not ridiculous.I would recommend Scott Hahn's ""Hail Holy Queen"" for a better contextual and dotrinal understanding of the person and role of Mary and Marian devotion.Three stars for pictoral content only."
3,Good But Not Great,"The two yoga workouts on this DVD are good, but pretty basic. I like Kurt Johnson's instruction but some of the flow from pose to pose felt a little awkward. There are two routines, one 25 minute and one 45 minute. I would have liked a full 30 minute routine and an hour long routine. The two routines felt very similar and I would have liked a little more variety between the two. Overall a decent DVD for the money."
5,Rich and Luxurious,"These candles are wonderful! the scent permeates the air even when it is unlit and just sitting with the lid off. Lit they will burn for 60 hours. The candles have a rich, luxurious scent. These are absolutely my favorite candles and the Bergamot Tobacco is the best of all."
5,Delicious candles!,"I discovered these at my acupuncturist's office - Tobacco Bergamot is by far my favorite scent. These candles permeate the air even when they're not burning and provide a soothing, relaxing aroma. I love these candles, they are well worth the money. I buy four at a time and put them all over the house (granted, it's a small house :) and the whole house smells wonderful. My favorite time to burn them is on a rainy or cold day or in the evening.The other scents are nice too but I just cannot get over Tobacco Bergamot."
5,Archipelago Bergamot Tobacco delightful smell,Love the Archipelago Bergamot Tobacco candle and the wonderful scent it has even without burning it. It is on my kitchen table for all to enjoy. Purchased at Amazon.com.
5,A Gift for the heart AND the soul,"GypsySoul is about phenomenal and hauntingly beautiful voices and harmonies and guttural, sensual instrumentation. It's about two very, very talented artists whose styles blend with and compliment each other in a way I've not heard in more than a decade. It's about incorporating bits of culture from the many places they've performed and creating a unique sound that touches MY very soul. I NEEDED to have ALL their CDs. I crank up the volume, turn down the lights, and let the music wash over me, drown out everthing around me, while I ""dance like nobody's watching."" Amazing, amazing! AMAZING!"
5,Very Romantic,"Of three favorite Keiko CDs (Wildflower, Deep Blue and The Ring)The Ring is the most consistently ""romantic,"" while Wildflower uses electronica best; and Deep Blue stands between them. I would like to give all potential buyers of Keiko CDs some advice I wish someone had given to me: If you want to hear Keiko Matsui at her best; that is, without a lot of distracting vocals and too-smooth saxaphone solos that make you cringe; then, in general, be wary about buying any of her work on the ""Shout"" label, and buy only from her work on the ""Narada"" label. Now---let's not forget Whisper From The Mirror: Matsui's most magically magnificent music, with superlative use of bass...Whisper From The Mirror isa MIGHTY FINE CD."
2,"An amusing hat, but be informed...","Judging from the picture, I thought this thing looked like a turban! It actually has no wrapped fabric, but is a firmly fitting cap. Hidden in the back is an elastic band that will adjust for larger heads, which is attached to the edges of an ugly looking triangular gap. Aside from this, the coloring is too bold. Old Glory will select random coloration for each customer, but my selection has over twice the color variety as the one in the picture! I don't see how I can wear it without attracting stares."
1,"On top of it all, a bad ending","Okay, after all the worst cliches (pointed out in a previous review,) and then a terrible villian (no professional golfer would ever act the way Noro did,) the ending didn't wrap up all the loose ends.Don't waste your time on this one."
5,Great,I have bought this product many times. Always consistent. I use it to make ice tea and it works great. Less expensive then the name brand tea bags and better quality. It is a strong tea so a box lasts.
5,Few book titles so accurately reflect the contents.,"This book is perhaps the best introduction to meditation on the market. It takes meditation out the area of religion and all the doo doo associated with it, and puts it right at the center of a science of the inner, exactly where it belongs. For the intelligent individual who doesn't want to be lumbered with yet another belief system, this is their book."
3,More of a money maker than anything else,"This book is not really a book by Osho, but more of an extraction of the practical excercies from ""The Book of Secrets"" by Osho.If you don't have ""The Book of Secrets"" get it - its amazing; if you do have it already then this book will be of no use to you, unless you want a summary of ""The Book of Secrets"" without the good parts.This book is just a money making racket I think - extracting bits and pieces of Osho's works and putting a fancy title on them. They've already got my cash, hopefully they won't get yours also."
5,Dear Tony...,"You are right, Natalie Dessay sings the Queen of the Nights aria a semi-tone lower. In fact, the whole opera is a tone lower. It is recorded on Authentic instruments, which were tuned a semi tone lower in mozarts day than they are now. Therefore almost all pieces recorded on baroque instruments are a semi-tone lower.I think the recording is masterful. Semi tone lower or not..."
4,As promised,"This is a great cheap bar and chain. Works well, it's a shame the POS craftsman chainsaw I put it on wasn't as good quality and lasted about 4 cuts after replacing the bar and chain. I can't comment on how well it lasted but it's above OEM quality for crap craftsman chainsaws."
4,No Problems to report!,I have no complaints with this bar or chain! Meets or exceeds my expectations for a combination saw and chain!
4,Nice quality Bar & Chain for a reasonable price.,"This Bar & Chain fit my Craftsman chainsaw fine. I am satisfied with it but it does not have the chain tensioner built into the bar like the original one had. The tension is obtained by prying on the bar with a screwdriver, this works but not as convenient as the original unit."
5,Easy and simple just like the product,The carriers were easy to install and I've bashed and race with on my rustler and they have held up well and they were exactly wut the seller describe ty
4,glass shelf,"shelf is very nice, fits perfectly within very specific requirements of a smaller wall, exactly as portrayed in amazon catalogue"
4,good brush for fine hair,"It is very difficult to get a brush through my fine hair when it is wet, so I need a brush with bristles that yield. I first discovered this brush in a drug store; I bought two, one for my workout bag and one for home. As a previous review noted, the brush does fail after time at the glue seal that holds the bristle pad to the structure of the brush. I got years of use out of each one, but eventually needed to replace them and couldn't find that style in a store. Amazon came through when I searched on-line."
4,I thought it was the answer,"My daughter still did not like it, we have a heck of a time getting her to brush her hair, the brush seemed good to me"
1,Horrible,I bought one of these brushes for it to break apart where its glued then bought anyone for the same thing to happy.this is a horrible brush!!!
3,Not what I needed,"Probably a great reference for the right person. Unfortunately it did not provide the information I was seeking. If your reference need is obscure, it would be best to review the literature before making the purchase."
2,algebra is not that hard,"but at least this book makes it look so. many notations in the book come from nowhere and explained in nowhere, which practically makes it harder to follow what the author's trying to demonstrate. i mean come on, this is a textbook, which means nothing new, you just need to arrange things nicely, and make everything clear."
3,"Childish Writing, High-Falutin' Vocabulary","This rather strange story of a stray transformed into a bio-electric phenomonen seems pitched all over the place, in terms of audience. My 5-year old was very attentive to the story, even remembering some of the heavy-handed foreshadowing. However, the language was very arch, with thesaurus-like word choices, that went right over her head. Presumably, this will help stretch youngster's vocabulary. The story itself is *extremely* contrived, but does take advantage of the great longing many children have for pets. Perhaps the worst thing about the story is the very obvious decision to defuse the dramatic tension at the end, so as to allow for a sequel, which I see has already been written. I suspect, but don't know for sure, that this celebrity author might not have been published if not for his name recognition."
1,This is not good...sorry,I tried so hard to like this cd but I just cant. If it was a different band name I might but you can't replace a drummer and singer like they had with this and expect to sell it as the old thing....gimme a break..dont waste your money
2,The Rehearsal,"I was very excited to read this book after carefully examining the inside flap at the book store. I was extremely disapointed, however at the slow pace of the story line and of the many characters whom I cared nothing about. The author had such a unique idea going, bringing a rehearsal of ""Of Mice and Men"" to life for one solid month, but brought in so many insignificant players, that the book dragged on for too long.As for Beth, the horrendous 16 year old daughter, there had to have been some good qualities in her somewhere. She was portrayed as a jealous, conniving and loathsome adolecent. Having been a daughter, and having two myself, I thought her character was exagerated and made young women in whichever decade, have a bad name.This is the first novel that I have read in a long time that I would not reccommend."
1,"Largely a waste of ink, paper and the reader's time.","Using an unlikely premise as a backdrop, Willis spends 90% of her book developing characters that remain uninteresting and who never actually do anything interesting.Irritatingly written entirely in the present tense, this book is largely a waste of ink, paper and the reader's time."
4,very good,"very good product and you can feel the magnetic field around your body after a day of wearing it,, good product and i recommended it..."
1,Terrible display of writing,This book is merely a spark compared to Drawn To The Flame by Dr. Stadolnik
4,LENS ADAPTER,"Very easy to use, customers should be informed when purchasing lenses that adapted is required.["
2,Poor with wide-angle lens,"When mated to a Sony wide-angle lens, the on-camera flash becomes partially blocked causing a dark area in the photo. A major flaw in my opinion.Sony makes no mention of this on the packaging."
5,Great Value!,"We received this toy as an early christmas present and it has been great! My son loves the puzzles and I love how convenient the storage case makes clean up. He can spend hours playing and it only takes me second to out it away! Also, the case is light and sized well so it fits anywhere. This is a perfect first puzzle set!"
4,Great Toy-Beware storage box,"My daughter loves these puzzles. They are great for teaching interactions with her. The large knobs are perfect for her to maneuver. My only concern is the storage box. It is very heavy if pulled down by your child. Also, the puzzles often don't slide in the slots straight(will tilt off the track) and this causes the puzzle to jam in the box. This is extremely frustrating to my daughter who likes to take the puzzles out and slide them back in. Good solution would be to just keep the wood storage box out of reach."
1,This dude is an idiot,Big Nick is not funny quite frankly. And he knows nothing about sports much less Life. Chris Paul is garbage by the way.
4,A good read,"Although I didn't agree with everything the author said, it helped me to understand where some people are coming from. This book did help me to understand the black perspective of things about issues that can be too sensitive to talk about even with people you consider your friends. The book isn't really about making friends with black people, it is a philosophy of race presented in a fun-to-read way. You'll laugh during the reading, but you'll find yourself thinking abouth the deeper messages long after you put the book down."
5,Works great...................,I don't install this kinda stuff but my car expert does. Wasn't hard for him at all. Put it on weeksago and my power steering hasn't turned into manual steering. Must be working. Thanks!
5,all the best elements!,"take the best elements from:shoe-gaze, ethereal, psychedelic, dream-pop, and all the other cliches that make rock from the last 20+ years interesting. this album has excellent bass work, guitars(can't beat a richenbacher[sic]for this sound), everything! this cd is in my top 10 of all time! total sonic bliss at all levels! to be honest, when i bought this in 1997, i thought it was o.k. well, one day i was taking a bath in my antique tub in athens, ga. i decided to listen underwater! i heard more levels in the music! soundscapes with structure that form to create a stunning work of great depth! this album gives 'souvlaki' by slowdive a run for the money!"
4,Good---But Not the Best,"This Mass is one of my very favorite Mozart compositions. Despite the fact that he was unhappy in 1779 and desperate to leave Salzburg, K 317 is no doubt one his most glorious works. At times, the music is so exuberant and rich it feels more like an opera than a sacred mass! But I have mixed feelings about this particular recording of this Mozart masterpiece. There are parts of the Mass that are very well done, such as the Agnus Dei, but there are many sections that feel rushed and quite forced to me. I also feel the accoustical balance between the orchestra and the choir is sometimes uneven. Perhaps the best track on the disc is the eerily beautiful Ave Verum Corpus. Altogether a very respectable recording, but not the best version of the Coronation mass that I've heard."
2,Going through the motions,"I read some positive reviews on Amazon about this Knack release and after listening to the CD in full, it's lackluster at best. Doug Fieger's song writing has seen better days. All of the tunes are similar in style and sound. Gone are the edgy songs The Knack had become famous for. In fact, there were times when I thought I was listening to the The Rutles. Also, the entire CD sounds as if far too much compressions was applied to the tracks (the drum sound is terrible). The best track is the old Badfinger song ""No Matter What"". This CD is no where near the energy and creativity of their first release or their 1991 release Serious Fun. BnB Beatles Depot"
5,Awesome!,"Since I bought this CD I've been playing it over and over. The Knack's sound here is clean, simple, and honest. Their covers of Badfinger and Elvis Costello are truly gems."
2,Huge Let Down,"I was expecting this DVD to be as high impact and high energy as their dance routines, but I was sadly disappointed. I hardly broke a sweat. Very disappointing!"
2,"Wow, haha","I don't actually have this DVD, but after reading the other reviews on how bad it is, I had to check it out. I looked it up on Youtube, and there is a short clip of it there. Yes, it is pretty bad. Looks like you won't break a sweat at all, and the girls voices are really annoying. It does seem like a very ""dumbed down"" high school video. Won't waste my money, I will keep looking for something else."
3,Expected More,"I expected more from this video - like some real Calorie Blasting Dance. It is easy enough to pick up, and they do describe the steps very well...but it's almost like they are addressing children in the video. Oh well, I still use it, and maybe I'll learn to love it."
2,this makes you feel dumb,I can't get past the girls annoying dumb blonde voice lol not very much of a workout. if you want cardio this isn't it
4,Dallas Cowboys Power Squad Dance,"We enjoyed the DVD, but it seems to be a beginner workout. So, it was fun, but it you are wanting to burn a lot of calories, this might not be the DVD for you. Shipped fast!"
2,Looking for a fun workout? Look Elsewhere!,"I was SO excited when I heard this was coming out. I have been trying to lose a few pounds for years, but have a major problem with motivation... So I thought, hey, this looks fun and its only 30 minutes. I can do that!The dvd has 5 women (One of which has an AMAZINGLY annoying voice) doing 3 - 8 minute repetitions. I didn't even work up a sweat doing this workout. It might be good for toning, but ""high calorie burn dance blast"" it certainly isn't. I wouldve been better off using that money on a gym membership."
1,don't bother,"I bought this because I'm a big cowboys fan, and I thought it would be fun to learn some of the DCC routines. I read the other customers' somewhat negative reviews, but I'm not in the best shape, so I thought it would be okay for me.WRONG! First off, the DVD is SHORT, around 45 minutes from start to finish. You only get one dance routine, which is broken up into four parts. I was expecting some fun dance music (similar to what the cheerleaders perform to), and it was a lame techno-type track throughout. I also found some of the girls' voices to be particularly annoying.I didn't feel energized or like I burned any calories.All in all, this product was a big disappointment for me."
3,fun and basic,As a cheerleader growing up and a past cheer coach I thought this would be a fun workout. Fun it is. But I was expecting it to be a little more fast as far as dancing goes. I would of loved to learn something more like the sideline dance routine which is featured in the bonus feature section. That is what i was expecting more of. If the girls would of taught the sideline dance routine then this would of been 5 stars. For beginners it is great. I will be challenging myself to learn the sideline routine myself..
5,Simba is King!,"I found this an enjoyable book. My daughter of three just loves it! It is written in good language and just right for her age. There is also not to much written on each page, but the book still follows the video-story closely. The illustrations are bright and of high quality! Really a joy to read and re-read!"
5,A One-Song Wonder,"While there are a lot of great jams in this recording, I would buy it simply for one song: Amazing Grace by the Blind Boys of Alabama. They've taken a classic and retuned it to ""House of the Rising Sun"" and it is powerful. The album has some lulls but overall, very good!"
3,Just a taste,"If you want a tiny little snack of the music that was played at Bonnaroo, than this is a great sample platter. However, if you have a voracious musical appetite, like me, then you'll still be feeling pretty hungry after listening to this. The producers of the event should have considered at least three CDs, if not four or more."
2,"With that many songs to choose from, should be better","This should have been one of the best albums of the year, but the song selection was rather poor. I was quite disappointed."
2,Let Down,"I knew the track list before I bought it, but this disc lacks alot of great music from the weekend. In particular, no Umphrey's Mcgee, no Disco Biscuits, and no Keller Williams Incident! I think most people that buy this disc could do without Del McCoury, The Blind Boys of Alabama, John Butler Trio, or Norah Jones. People are being deprived of great jams, and that just isn't right!"
3,Also left out - The Gabe Dixon Band!!,"Don't get me wrong, the disc really rocks. Besides Disco Biscuits, they also left out The Gabe Dixon Band. Those guys really jammed at the show and I'm [upset] they're not on the album. Fortunately, they have a new album out (On a Rolling Ball) which comforts me somewhat. I definitely recommend checking that out. . ...."
3,very good but not great,this is one of those concert festival cds that would have been so much better live... some of the tracks live Les Claypool and Robert Randolph really rocked on but other like Bela Fleck and most of disc 2 could have been way better. the one really good thing this cd did is make me aware of the Bonnaroo Festival and who could be playing at it this year! you would be better of finding bootlegs of the show.
5,Live From Bonnaroo Double CD Exceeds Expectations,"Live From Bonnaroo Double CDThe live from Bonnaroo Double CD was released on Tuesday, September 24th and features two discs of incredible live performance from this summers ultimate music festival. Fans of all types of music will find themselves enthralled with this collection, which gathers together some of today's most explosive and incredible live talent. This album chronicles some of the most exciting bands out there and captures them at their best. The deluxe edition packaging features a beautiful full-color booklet with photos by Danny Clinch and original liner notes. Fan of music should not miss this incredible collection!"
4,Another winner from Clark's,"And they do it again. Another comfortable, pretty shoe. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because as they don't make it in wide I was forced to order 8.5 M instead of 8 W so there is too much space showing in front of my toes. Clarks sizing runs a bit all of the place, I have 9 M's that fit better. But this shoe is awfully cute and a steal at around $30!"
1,Not a good value for anyone,"Whether you are an experienced admin or a new MCSE candidate, you should avoid this book. The sample questions presented here do not in any way resemble the actual exam questions and will lull you into a false sense of security. Look for an exam guide that has highly detailed questions. The included CD-ROM is also not helpful in that it contains a mere 60 questions - none of which resemble the actual exam. Don't waste your money."
3,Good for general overview,"This is a good book to use as an introduction to Windows XP. The book is easy enough to read (unlike some computer books/sleeping pills) with decent explanations of the concepts, however, it is not comprehensive enough to use as the primary source of info to pass the exam. The sample test questions are not even remotely like the type of questions asked on the 70-270 test. If you buy this book just be ready to purchase others as well before you take the test. This book used in conjunction with the Examcram book, and with online resources was enough for me to pass the test."
3,Revised Review,"Initially I wrote a review of this book and gave it a single star. My reason for this was - I really did not learn anything new in the book. I wrote the review based on my experience. As such, I nicknamed this book XP for Dummies. I failed this exam the first time - having only used my experience and this book. There was quite a bit on the exam that is not covered in this book (nor apparently did I have the experience with these items). I passed the exam a couple days later after reading through the MS Readiness Review for the XP exam. I would highly recommend this book - for people that already know quite a bit about XP. It assumes you know most of it. I would not recommend that book for people new to XP. I think though, with the combination of the two books you should do well. So, since I initially gave this 1 star as far as being useful for the MCSE (but said that for a person new to XP it would be 5 stars) - I have edited this review and given it 3 stars."
2,Does not meet criteria..,"I bought this book to study for exam 70-270. I can not remember if there were reviews of other titles available, or if I bought this book on good faith, regardless. This book is one gleaming, steaming, dungpile of wasted time and money bound in a Hardback for you pleasure. The technical content presented, combined with the quiz method provided in the self tests will assure you waste hard earned money. I read this book cover to cover, and just happened to read a review before taking 70-270. Heaven looked down on me. You have a sense when performing the end of chapter self-test question that ""This seems too easy. Or, the wrong answers are too easy to isolate."" Dont waste your time or money. Oh, and btw, if you see one of these books in your local book store, and you happen to need to relieve yourself... Put it to good use and bring it in the bathroom with you.. No silly, dont read it.. Wipe your arse with it."
1,Makes a great door stop!,"This is a very broad overview of the operating system, the test questions are ridiculously easy - how they managed to fill 700+ pages is beyond me! Find a REAL study guide before taking the test!!!"
4,Wrong track listing,"The track list is for the original Big Mello (1992), there is only 12 songs on this cd, which is still good, since this cd has been off the market since 1994, so if you wanna re-live the bone-hard classic but screwed grab this one. Hopefully Rap-A-Lot will re-release the original along with Bringing Hell On Earth by Too Much Trouble."
1,Home/Office Audio-Video Observation System,"I bought this system for my home to watch my yard cars and chilren outside playing, i had it home 22 days and now i have to return it due to it just stopped working, if this would of still worked, i would say its a great system for the money, one thing is the cameras do not have wide angles to view areas, the tv is very big and bulky, but other than that it does or would do alot for the price if it worked, im sending this back today 3/23/10 good luck with yours"
2,too noisy,didn't realize it was going to be soooooo loud. i would have preferred a more descriptive note as there are fans that are pretty quiet
2,Broan 676 110-CFM 4.0-Sones Ceiling Mount Ventilation Fan,I have returned this fan. It vibrated and rattled excessively. Much too noisy. Bought to replace older version of the Broan model 676 whose fan was beginning to fail. This new fan was even more noisy than the older one with a failing motor. Not acceptable! I will just go get a replacement motor which is going to cost more than this entire fan unit cost.
4,Parts of this fit,Ordered to replace same model but mounting box was bigger so I used the motor and ceiling cover works perfect
3,Noisy,"Good air flow, but fan motors are noisy. Bought two and after having a year both have been problem free."
2,Its very loud,It's very powerful fan..but very loud..would have preferred a quieter one..price and deliver was ok..loud noice is driving me crazy..
3,DUCT Size?,"When replacing bathroom fans, the duct size can be extremely important.I have found the higher CFM products usually have a 4"" duct.However, older homes often have 3"" ducting.Ducting in two story homes often can not be replaced with new ducting, particularly when the fans are crammed into small spaces.Most hard ware stores do not sell 3 to 4 inch duct converters.Further, Amazon does not indicate the duct size for this fan. I can not determine whether or not this fan has 3 or 4 inch ducting."
4,Broan 684 a perfect fit,"This is a basic fan that was a perfect replacement for an old one we had. It has 80 vs 50 CFM on our old unit. We can tell the difference. There is no steam on the mirror when we open the shower curtain. The sones were the same, it is what you would expect for a bathroom fan. No frills, just a little workhorse. That is what we wanted. We did chose to remove the flimsy plastic damper, inserting a better one. (A fantech spring loaded backdraft damper). This makes a huge difference in our very windy area. Highly recommend you do this with any of these ventilation fans! I can't believe the manufacturer's wouldn't add one of these to their products. They are inexpensive and highly effectly. The plastic dampers are the worst!"
5,excellent price,"after shopping at the big box stores we went to amazon, where we usually buy from after doing some research! so happy with our purchase."
3,Not for kitchen use.,I bought this fan as a replacement for a ceiling mounted kitchen fan that was over 50 years old.The information available seems to imply it can be used in the kitchen.This exhaust fan has a warning inside of the housing warning users not to use it as a kitchen fan. I did not see that in the advertising or reviews.
5,Just perfect...,Just perfect...needed to replace an existing fan that was too small....bought this one...Broan 676 110-CFM 4.0-Sones Ceiling Mount Ventilation Fan!~ It made a world of difference!~
3,It doesn't suck as advertised...or not in the right way.,"I challenge the CFMs...the room is still steamy...so yes, this does indeed suck. Do not buy for getting rid of steam."
1,Broan's tricky games,"First, let me say the Broan #676 is a good product. My problem arose because I was replacing an existing Broan #676 that had provided many years of good service. Broan does not make a replacement fan assembly for the #676, just the entire kit (fan assembly and housing). I thought that if I bought the same model, then I could take the fan assembly loose, pop it into the existing housing, and we'd be happy. However, when I received the item, I found that all #676's are not alike; in fact, the new fan and housing were completely different than my old version. Thus, I got the joy of climbing into the attic, removing the old housing, and installing the new one. That's about three hours of work instead of three minutes. Poo on Broan's configuration control, even if they do make a quality product."
4,beads,My daughter enjoys stringing the beads and wearing them. She likes to pretend she is sewing. The beads are made of wood and are indestructible (so far). It's a great toy and very developmentally appropriate for toddlers.
2,Not safe for little fingers,My son really like this toy. He would lace all the beads and pull it like choo choo train. The problem is some of the beads have holes that a little finger can get stuck into...not safe.
4,Good without the string.,"I bought this for my almost 2 year old to work on colors. I bought it in conjunction with a farm animal set. The set is great, just a little to advanced for my little one. The string is just that, a string, so little one has a hard time with the lacing and keeping the beads on. Currently we are using the colors with the animal set that has a shape stopper at the end and a larger wood dowel for threading. My son will grow into this toy."
5,Nice Beads,"I like these beads because they have big holes that make it easy for a wee one to string. My almost 3 yr. old isn't very interested in them yet, but I know we will be making some colorful necklaces very soon."
2,boys are bored,"My 2 and 4year olds hated this. maybe it's a boy thing. It did not hold their attention and they ended up throwing beads, hard beads, all over the house."
4,For same granddaughter,She had not opened them yet so do not know. I am pretty sure she will have fun with it though.
4,Beads,I like the beads and the strings... I just wish it had a better case to hold the beads in. It comes as shown and it would just be nice if it had a lid or cover so all the beads don't fall out. Other then that it's a great durable product.
4,Great for Montessori Approach,"This product helps children develop their fine motor skills and is part of the 'practical life' curriculum for Montessori. Although many reviewers state that this is good for the 2 and up crowd, I would argue that many children can do some of the threading (of the beads) much earlier. My daughter, for example, received this as a gift for her first birthday and was able to thread the bead at around 14 months old. My only criticism of this product is that the paint chips easily and so if your child likes to chew, I wouldnt recommend it."
5,Great toy!,"I like this toy a lot! It has a great educational value and i am sure that my child will play with it for a long time. BUT, the insides of the beads are not polished! It is difficult enough for my 18 mos old daughter to get the string through the hole, so you'd think that the pulling will be easy. But the string gets stuck and my daughter gets frustrated. Very disappointing! My husband is going to polish it himself. I hope M&D; can improve this little problem.UPDATE: I contacted Melissa and Doug about the roughness of the inside of the beads. They appologized and mailed a new toy free of charge. So i'm changing the number of stars to five!"
1,not what i expected,"for a M and D product this was very disappointing. The wood pieces are nice from the outside, but the area within the hole of each piece is like particle board. When the string rubs against it, paint chips and small wood pieces fall out. if the interior where the hole is were coated like the exterior of the beads, it would have been the perfect learning tool for my little one. VERY DISAPPOINTED. Am looking for plastic version now."
2,LOST MAGIC,"The title CD of the great and overlooked band has a few good songs, but nothing at all very memorable. If you're looking to enjoy Drivin' and Cryin and want quality stuff, then:""Fly Me Corageous""-can't go wrong with the hard rockin' album, though remembr that it was made late 80's (early 90's ?), and enjoy""Wrapped in Sky""- in my opinion a gorgeous album; accoustic, sweet songs, a couple of hard-rock drivers, and some amazing moments. The entire album smells of South Dakota. (You'll know what I mean if you've been to South Dakota and are a big D&C fan.)"
5,Blast from the Past!,"I really love this movie so I had to get the poster for my man-cave. This poster is like a genuine piece of art, it's beautiful in its design. The black frame is very sleek and doesn't look cheap at all and the poster ships with it already in the frame so all you have to do is pull it out of the box and hang it up on your wall."
5,Kids Are Punny,"As an educator, I use this film in my teacher training classes to show the important connection between learning and humor. This film is filled with insights and celebrates the phenomenal wisdom of children. More of us should take humor as seriously as these children do."
1,nice idea but uncomfortable,"I have a size 9 foot and these socks are tight. tube shaped so very uncomfortable at the heel. Would not buy again, would return had I bought locally"
5,Cooking the Thai Way,"Short but sweet cookbook. Love the recipes and easy to read, understand and I have tried many already. It has changed my cooking almost exclusively to Thai."
3,Boards warped,"Boards warped making it hard to keep puzzels pcs togather, my 3 year old does love to stack and sort the shapes though."
3,Should have read other reviews,I thought the patterns were wedged/kind of like holes/puzzles that the shapes will sit in. BUT these were on a plain board and my son did not like it. I gave it 3 stars because it is my mistake in not reading other reviews.Amazon must put something in the product description that states this so that people know before buying (without totally relying on reviews).
5,Sturdy Toy,"I gave this to my three year old nephew for Christmas. His parents seemed to think it might be a little advanced for him, but after opening and playing with the blocks for a minute or two he loved it and was smiling as he figured it out. The box should hold up, because before opening the toy, my nephew literally sat on the wooden box and slid around on the floor like it was a sled, and the box seemed fine. I would recommend this toy for a child that likes puzzles and creativity. I would agree with other reviewers that it would be nice if the box had a lid, but if you aren't traveling with it, you should be fine."
4,Classic,"Just a few flaws:- Some of the pieces were ""sliced"" unevenly.- My nephew is 3.5, and he wanted to be able to complete ALL of the puzzle boards at one time, but couldn't because of the distribution of pieces. (Lots of some, few others.) It made him fairly upset, which one does try to avoid when giving a gift.- There is no lid to the box. Really strange design flaw to me. I put the pieces in a plastic baggy so they won't get lost, but it's not ideal for the kid.Overall, way better than the plastic ""Made in China"" crap that kids are bombarded with these days. My nephew loved it, but was pretty bummed that he couldn't admire all of his finished puzzles at one time. Seems like an easy enough fix."
3,Great product. Horrible Packaging.,"My 2 and 4.5 year old really enjoy playing with this. It's nice because they can both play at the same time (there are enough tiles). My 4 year old tries to reproduce the images from the boards on a separate surface for an extra challenge.What makes me upset is the absurd packaging for this product and many other Melissa and Doug products. There are dozens of pieces and no way to package this toy. I would not recommend it simply because of this. Thumbs down, M&D;."
5,Old School is New School,"I am a Kindergarten teacher and I purchased this for my four year old niece. This product is durable, and best, it stays in its own storage box, so none of the pieces get lost. This ""toy"" teaches, shapes, colors, patterns. It increases fine motor skills and the children can become creative and make their own designs. Believe me, children need this practice instead of constantly using technology."
4,I wish it came with a lid,I love the actual pattern blocks and the puzzles. They offer countless ways of playing and doing math. My only wish for the product is that it came with a lid for the container so that it's easy to clean and store.
3,"Great Toy, Terrible Packaging!","My son has played for hours with this toy. He loves not only matching the shapes with the pattern, but sorting the pieces by shape or color. He also makes his own patterns with them. My complaint about this toy is that there is NO LID! Melissa and Doug are notorious for not having lids for their toys, but they should consider something, clear plastic would work very well. Because there is no lid, the pieces are EVERYWHERE! I'm constantly cleaning them up and counting them to see how many are missing. It also makes it difficult to stack on a shelf. Other than that, their quality is exceptional. Unfortunately, I have had many M&D toys in my house...and many have been thrown out and not replaced because there are no lids for the boxes and I can't see spending top dollar on toys that just get lost. If there was a lid for this toy, they would get a very enthusiastic 5 stars!"
4,No Lid?,"The product itself is great, my wife uses it for work. The only thing I didn't like was that there wasn't a lid. They give you this great wood box for all of your pieces but no lid to keep it from tumbling out. I made one out of some thin wood and a few small hinges and now it's great.for what she needs."
3,Pattern Fun,"I am only rating this 3 stars overall because there is no top/lid to this pattern board, which means in a short time we will begin losing pieces and lose some of the value/fun. My 4 yo has enjoyed following the patterns on the boards."
4,Abstract puzzle,"My daughter received this from Nana for Easter. She is almost five years old and has really enjoyed it, but I have one complaint. Her little brother received the younger child version of this & it has shapes cut into the board so the pieces don't slide off the board. This particular version is just flat so it can be difficult to keep the pieces on the board. It would have been better if the entire picture was inset with an edge all around so the pieces wouldn't slide off. However, she still enjoys playing with it. I also like that it all stores in the box and the lid slides into place so the pieces don't fall out even if the box is tipped upside down."
2,"Great fun, Problem with Product though","This is a fun game for 4 or 5 and older. The concept is easy for younger ones to learn, but the boards are slippery and too hard for a smaller child to deal with on their own. It comes with a box to hold everything, but no top, so it is really not a storage box since the small pieces can easily spill out. Also a few of the puzzle boards have buckled slightly since opening the box a month ago."
5,hours of fun ...lots of little pieces,"My sister-in-law bought this for my sons 3rd birthday, he loves it and plays with it for hours. Within a week he knew all his shapes, and then we started working on left and right. I would say ""turn that piece to the right and it will fit better."" Within a few weeks he knew his right from left.The only down side is LOTS of little pieces. I also have a 5 month old who loves to put things in her mouth. I had to make the rule ""only at the kitchen table and it must be put away when you're done"" I explained how dangerous it is for his baby sister... now he puts all his puzzles away. Because he wants to be a good big brother. Huge bonus!"
4,great educational toy that should have come with a lid,got this for my two year old who is learning colors and shapes. like everything about it except that it doesnt include a lid so storing it is annoying.
4,good educational toy,"This is a good educational toy.There were some number of pattern blocks missing,but the rest of the toy is good.The colour patterns could have been more distinct from each other,eg. when making patterns,the dark green has to be put alongside dark blue.But overall a good product."
3,diamond pcs a bit small,"some pcs are too small for kids under age 3, however, this pattern building is made for 2-3 yr olds."
3,Good product...,This is a fun toy though the pieces slide off the boards which makes it frustrating for my son. I wish I got magnetic ones.
5,Fun and good quality.,THis is a neat toy and fun to learn colors and shapes. My boys don't love them but maybe because they are boys. I would buy again if my boys played with them more.
2,Not much fun,The pieces of this toy would not stand in place for long. For a little kid with not the perfect coordination and fine finger movements it is not the best toy for age 3-4. May be a little older ones
4,Fun,"I got this toy as a christmas present for my best friend's 5 yr old boy. He loves it. He plays with it often which is a nice change of pace from all the action figures and more ""violent"" toys that he has."
5,Pattern Blocks are perfect,"This is a very durable toy that has an abundance of pattern block shapes in varying colors to be placed on pre designed patterns imprinted on ""wood"" boards. My only criticism is the packaging. It all comes in a nice wood box, but it does not have a cover. I had to put the blocks in a ziploc before putting them in the box. Great for creating new designs, learning shapes, colors, and creative thinking."
2,Hard to use as designed,"This toy is hard to play with. My kids get the concept, but the pieces shift easily and it is almost impossible to create a picture. The same toy would work great if there were borders outlining the image. I do not recommend it. Most kids just get frustrated, because they cannot keep the pieces in their places and the result does not look neat.My kids tried it a couple of times and gave up."
5,Our 3 year old LOVES it!,"We bought this set for our 3 year old son and the more basic Melissa and Doug set (similar to this, but easier) for our 20 month old little girl and they love to do them! Our son sits at the table and works on this, it's wonderful to see our crazy Star-Wars playing kiddo transform into a quiet kid once I get this out! A great activity to do when I need to make dinner and have them both sit for a bit! I keep them up in a cupboard because the package doesn't have a lid, so they can spill out, but it's not a problem for us ;)"
1,"Good idea, poorly executed","I bought this puzzle set for my four year old grandson because the concept is excellent: replicating color and shapes; building designs. If the puzzle worked, it would be a particularly good pre-reading skill. The problem, as mentioned in an earlier review, is that the pieces slide very easily on the shiny design board. Unless the child places pieces in the middle of the design, and then builds out, the pieces move all over the board. For that reason, I recommend that you buy the magnetic version."
3,Frustration,"My oldest son received it for his 3rd birthday and could not play with it alone. The pieces moved and he's got frustrated. My youngest child has the same problem with it. As one of the previous reviewers said - ""this is not a puzzle"".We've got a pattern block puzzle recently and that is what they both like. It is called Toysie Snappers. We bought it in the local store and I have not seen it on Amazon yet."
1,"Ehh, not so great","In concept seems like a good idea, but my 3 year old wasn't that intersted after a few min. Maybe too challenging for that age? I also find the packaging annoying - there is no top, so everything falls out."
3,Wished for more,"Nice toy but I was disappointed that the pieces do not fit ""into"" the woodern tray as in a puzzle, but have to be placed ""on top"" of the preordained color. So creativity is not what I thought it would be. Also, the toy needs a ""top"" or cover."
2,boring,"OK, I don't know why any child would find this interesting or be motivated to play with it. Each ""puzzle"" is a piece of wood with fully colored shapes on it. The child matches the colored flat blocks to the shapes on the board. When the puzzle is completed, it looks exactly the same as before it is completed. I can't believe it gets such good reviews. My 3-year-old moved on halfway through the first puzzle, and I don't blame her."
1,Not good for a pre school child.,"Although durable,definitely not good for a pre schooler as the pieces do not stay put. Difficult to use even for an older child. Returned."
3,Give it a try!,"I brought this puzzle for my daughter who is 3 years old. She seems to enjoy it a lot, the one thing that I love about this game is that it keeps her busy for a long time."
1,Not as good as it looks.,"This is a great concept but it does not work! The wooden pieces do not stay in place as you put the picture together. It's not awful but it frustrates my child, he wants each piece to stay exactly where he put it! I would try 'Playful Patterns' by Discovery Toys. It has foam pieces on a plastic board so they hold. Also, they have more shapes that can be used to make other shapes - semi circles to make circles, right angled triangles to make squares etc."
5,Sometimes name brand product is better!,"I had bought two other cheaper off-brands ""NP-FR1"" batteries for my Sony P-200 (which was minus it's Sony battery when I purchased it) and was disappointed in their performance. They just didn't last as long as I thought they should. So I thought I would bite the bullet and try the more expensive Sony battery and glad I did! The Sony battery has almost twice the life of the off-brands and shows the time remaining much more consistantly. I have never had to change batteries with the Sony, even on multi-day vacations , just charge once at night! Forget the cheapo's and get the real thing... the Sony! By the way, I think the P-200 camera is great too! - the glassman"
5,Holds its charge,"This battery holds its charge well over 24 hours and has strong performanace while in the camera as well. I do rapid shots at times and it still manages to keep up. Just remember, don't keep it in your camera for more then 48 hours...."
1,Wrong Battery recommendation,"When I ordered the battery to go with the Sony digital camera, it was based on the recommendation/suggestion box below the Sony digital camera. When I received the battery, it was not compatible/fit the digital camera.I was disapointed and now have to return it."
1,Not Impressed,"I'd love to review this book, however, it was ordered through Amazon on Feb 13, 2006 and as of this date, March 16, 2006, I have yet to receive it. What's the problem Amazon?"
5,great for car rides,if you know and love the kidsongs dvds then you will enjoy this. my kids are big kidsong fans and this keeps them quiet for long car rides. it's a joy now to go any where when we will be in the car for a long period of time. All the songs you know and love are here. the classics such as little bo peep or mary had a little lamb to kidsongs theme song are here. great pick and if my kids loved it then i believe yours will to.
2,too much money,I ordered this for my niece through Amazon (through another book seller). It is a smallish book of nice quality but certainly not worth $20.
4,Extremely well though out yet difficult to penetrate,"From a music layman perspective, this is a very difficult piece to listen to. My wife performed it with the St. James Cathedral choir in Jan 2008 in Seattle, WA. I listened to the CD several times while she prepared and listened to her practice quite a bit. It is very interesting music, but should not be taken lightly, either.If you want to enjoy it, you need to sit down and think about this the way you'd think about stats or math homework. It becomes satifying and stimulating as your understanding of the piece grows. Don't expect to like it the first time if you're not familiar with atonal stuff, but a lot of great music is that way -- it takes time to digest and understand what was going on in the composer's mind when s/he did what they did."
2,Where was his editor?,"I read October Mourning with my book club. The story is so simple that it may be a good junior reader. The flu pandemic was covered well as a piece of history, but not as a good piece of literature. The language was very unsophisticated and I was astonished at the number of typos in the text."
3,October Mourning,"I was looking for a fictional history book about the 1918 flu that was not overwhelming in the scientific area surrounding this event. I found however that this book could have been written for a fifth grader. Sort of plain, not a grabbing story that I expected."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I bought this book to prepare for the SE II exam. I did not find it very useful. The problems are from past examinations (1970's and 80's), but NCEES does not publish old test questions. So I am guessing they are from old California state SE exams. I found the problems really complex. They are much more complex than the practice problems published by NCEES themselves. I learned more by studying my college text books and the code books."
3,Moderately helpful,"Seems to be Zeff's spin on Aron's previous book. He quotes her a lot. In her ""foreward"" Aron indicated that ""Ted and I approach many things differently, but...Ted's perspective is a good one."" That pretty much sums it up. He restates much of her info, but with his spin, which you might find helpful. He adds his experiences from teaching stress management classes. He recommends accupuncture, aromatherapy and ayurveda. If that is for you, he's your guy."
3,Some practical advice but some mamby pamby advice too,"This book contains practical advice when it comes to controlling overstimulation in your own environment but the idea to approach strangers and tell them you're a HSP is a joke. Most people will laugh at you and tell you ""you're just being too sensitive"" and blow you off. You can't go around telling everybody that you're an HSP and expect people to have any sympathy. The world just doesn't work that way. You don't go to your neighbor and say nicely: ""Excuse me Mr. Neighbor but could you please stop chainsawing your tree at 10 o'clock at night. You see, I'm a Highly Sensitive Person, and well golly gee wiz it's bothering me."" He'll laugh in your face."
2,"basic idea good, but ultimately vague and unsatisfying","I was very excited to get this book, and to identify with HSPs. However, the book didn't provide the practical advice I was hoping for. Instead it seemed like a general ""Go HSPs!"" book. I'm definitely checking out ""The Highly Sensitive Person"" by Elaine Aron (i.e., the original)."
1,I can sum up this book in one word: DUH.,"I was hoping to find ""new, practical coping strategies"" as quoted by Elaine Aron. This was just recycled holistic/new-age fodder. Granted, some of the suggestions are worthwhile, but I doubt there's anyone who hasn't heard of them many times before. Well, maybe, if people are taking the advice to avoid media like the plague!As another reviewer mentioned, this book encourages a victim mentality. ""Ooo, I'm so sensitive,"" doesn't work in the real world. We can't all get special treatment (this isn't a disability; ADA doesn't apply to HSP's), and we can't just up and move necessarily, or befriend every jerk. Barney's, ""I love you; you love me...."" just doesn't work with all people!I know what I need to do to take care of myself, and I imagine most HSP's have figured this out by trial and error.I give it a big DUH."
1,Terrible and full of New Age pseudoscience crap,"I was hoping for some practical advice on dealing with HSP in my day to day life, not advice on how to be a shut-in. If you've ever read any of the literature on HSP don't waste your time. The only really practical advice is as follows:Meditate and create a relaxing space.Communicate with coworkers, lovers, and neighbors.Eat healthy and exercise regularly, keep a regular schedule if possible.Just about everything else is either common sense or something you will have figured out long before touching this book. Have to deal with a crowed place? Minimize your exposure and wear either earplugs or toss some relaxing music on your ipod. Heavy traffic is stressful? Avoid situations where you have to drive in heavy traffic.There is also a lot of patently bad advice near the end involving bad pseudoscientific crap like homeopathy."
2,Elementary Reading,Nothing new here. Basic arithmetic. I'm sure most sensitive people have figured out all of these coping strategies long before reading this book.
1,Stay Away,"I've seen this approach, outlined in this book, in action; all I can say is - look elsewhere.......... this advice does not lead one towards any kind of maturity."
4,Useful Accessory,"I don't know about the remote control--seems like an unnecessary ""feature""--but this docking station does everything it should, with great style. It is well built, with a cool blue light at the top. Makes charging my camera and transferring images to my computer a breeze. I hesitated to purchase this item at first, because of its cost, but it has proven its worth. Highly recommended."
3,This program needs some work,"I have 2 major problems with this program. The first is that it is on a small little screen that you cannot blow up to full page. Yes, you can enlarge the screen by going through the menu but you should be able to just click on the enlarge icon and have it full screen. The notes are small, even in the enlarged mode and it will not go the the larger size on my laptop for some reason. Not very easy on the eyes.The second problem I have is that it doesn't label the notes when you start playing the first songs. If you're a beginner, like me, it would be nice to see the notes labeled for several lessons that are actual songs, it would make it easier to become accustomed to which notes went where on the lines.Other than that I'm enjoying learning how to play the keyboard."
5,Amazing ! !,"I was born and raised in Argentina. While growing up, I never bothered listening to Tango or Piazzola. I found them both to be extremely boring. I was recently visiting my brother in NYC, and found out that ""Maria de Buenos Aires"" was playing in Brooklyn, with the best poet of popular themes (Horacio Ferrer), whom also wrote several tangos, music from Piazzola, and two very good tango singers from Argentina. Hoping not to be dissapointed, I bought the tickets and went to see the show. It was incredible. It actually brought tears to my eyes at times. I guess that you have to be a mature person to understand and enjoy the quality of this opera. I immediately bought the CD, and continue to listen to it at least once a week... Incredible performances, well written tangos, and probably some of the best music ever written by the Maestro Piazzola. Highly recommended."
2,"Good topic, poor treatment","This is one of the worst armchair / recreational mathematics books I've read. The author takes a casual tone that becomes flippant and annoying. Moreover, the mathematics and real numbers work are present enough to drive away non-mathematically minded readers but completely lacking in enough detail to hold the remaining readers. I found myself skimming through the chapters desperately seeking a few nuggets of information without having to subject myself to too much of the surrounding patter. This was not at all enjoyable."
4,A great improvement over the paper dolls of my youth!,"These wooden ""paper dolls"" are very cool! Sturdy wood dolls w/ magnetized clothing pieces. I first saw these at my 4-year-old daughter's pre-school. The kids loved them! Now we have a set at home (and an extra set hidden away for a gift...)"
2,"Beautiful, But....","I have always thought of fairies as celtic entities, and light airy music as their forte. This CD was a little too dark and mysterious for my taste. I found it impossible to meditate to. I found it to be very TODAY type music with a tilt toward the dark side. The art work is lovely. I love everything that Brian Froud as done artisticly, but this music was too edgey for me."
5,kinda makes u hungry,there are so many variations of making the perfect sandwich. very sturdy product. the food is very realistic. totally satisfied.
2,Terrible quality but my daughter loves it,"Thought this looked adorable but when I received it, I immediately noticed the poor quality. Terrible paint job that was already chipped in numerous places and glue oozing everywhere from where the Velcro is glued on. My daughter loves it though and plays with it everyday but I won't be buying anymore wood food from Melissa and Doug."
4,Great Success,"We bought this for our 5 year old Granddaughter and it was a huge success. She loves to play ""pretend"" games and we spent hours tasting various sandwich combinations. Great for a child with an active imagination."
5,Great Imagination Maker,"We bought this for my son who is 2. He loves to make sandwiches for the whole family, he asks what we want and he can make it for us. It's hilarious to see him ""eat"" them! It's a great tool for his imagination."
5,Another hit from Melissa and Doug!,"When I need a reliable toy, I automatically look to Melissa and Doug. Made well. Realistic and my granddaughter has spent hours playing with them. Whenever it is someone's birthday, she makes a ""cake"" Melissa and Doug style. If I'm fixing dinner, she is cooking on her stove using the various items we've purchased made by Melissa and Doug. Probably, at first glance, they seem a bit expensive, but they last far longer than the plastics (after one step on a plastic veggie, and it becomes trash worthy), and are well made. I would recommend and will continue to purchase these products."
4,Kids love them,"My niece loves it! She didn't like the Christmas present I got her, so took it back and found out what she likes - this was it. Thank you."
3,Want lunch?,Was a bit disappointed with this sandwich making set. Well made but the pieces are hard for a litle one to figure out what they are. Odd looking lunch meat and veggies.
3,Not so good for 3 year old kids,"Is a good sturdy toy, but difficult to match the velcro sides if you have a little kid. I think it would be best for older ones."
5,"As a nanny, this is my favorite!!!","I am a nanny for a 18 mos. old and 3.5 year-old. It is very hard to find toys/games that both can not only enjoy, but participate and learn. This fits all those needs. The 3 year-old can be the ""chef"" and cut and divide (she's learned what ""half"" and ""quarter"" are just by playing with these foods that divide into halves and quarters, the 18mos. can play immagination with the food as we sit down for picnics. We can play for at least an hour with this."
3,Really cute...not gonna be for long...,"The girls like it and it is really cute but less than a month of having it and the paint is flaking off. Hope there's no lead in the paint, still better than the chinese plastic food toys."
3,son doesn't play with it,"This toy is very cute. The only quams I have with it are that my son simply doesn't play with it. He played with it for the first day and shows little interest in it now. I bought this for him because he loves cheeseburgers, so i bought them thinking he would love to role play. not so much, but he is only 2...so hpefully he'll play more with it! The velcro isn't super strong, but it works."
5,Niece and Nephew love fest!,My sister recommended getting them something from this brand for xmas because my niece got the cupcake set for her birthday a month before and they played with it constantly. They didn't have the toy she originally wanted so I went with the sandwich kit. I come from a big family so they received around 7 packages of toys that night and they wouldn't stop playing with the sandwich kit even long enough to open the other presents! It's a simple toy but they can't get enough. My niece is 3 and my nephew will be 2 years old in a month. Highly recommend!
3,Let's get cooking!,My son really enjoys making meals for me. I really like the Velcro dots on each piece b/c it helps them to build whatever sandwich they want and it will stick together. We are enjoying it!
5,Great Sandwich set,"This set is great. My boys love it, I bought 2 different ones and both of them are great. The kids love playing with them."
4,Wish it had a lid...,"With so many pieces, I wish this set came with a lid. My daughter likes it, but keeping it organized and the pieces together required purchasing another tub."
3,It's okay,My kids like this better than the fruit cutting ones from Melissa and Doug. They get stuck to the carpet though and I am afraid the velcro is going to wear out. For the price I don't think they are going to last very long.Wouldn't recommend.
5,Fun for 3 year old,"I gave this to my niece for her 3rd birthday. She loved it and immediately began making ""food deliveries"" to her party guests."
3,quick fun,"My three year old loves to help in the kitchen. This toy was purchased to keep him busy when I am doing detailed stuff. He likes it but his thrill comes from cutting the sandwiches up with the enclosed wooden knife. He does not use this product for any other reason so if you want minimal activity, this might be the toy for you."
4,Great toy - but the cutting fruit/food set is better,I like this - but if you're only going to get one melissa and doug food set - go for one of the cutting food sets!
5,Very good tool for training children to make you lunch,"I bought this set for Xmas for my nephew, Ben Franklin. Ben doesn't eat a very healthy diet because his parents are morons and feed him a bunch of carby junk - all kinds of puffs and cereal crap like that, which is ok but not when that's ALL you ever eat, he doesn't even eat chicken fangers as far as I know. I was hoping that maybe playing with this sammich set would teach him a little something about what normal people like to eat for lunch.I do not think this has improved his eating habbits, but he does enjoy playing with it. Hopefully after a few more weeks this set will train him to make his uncle sandwiches when I come to visit.Also - the quality is very nice. Good wood. Good paint job. I almost want to eat the tomato. I wish someone would have bought me this when I was younger."
5,Great buy,"My 3yr old loves to make sandwiches with this set. Keeps her very entertained, which makes mommy very happy...lol. Stays together nicely but also easy for her to pull apart."
3,Okay!,"I was very pleased with the food sets we purchased last year for Christmas. My daughter loves to play with them.One note worth mentioning is that the ""patty"" started peeling paint. I know my daughter isn't chewing on it, so I really don't know what caused this.With all the lead-paint scares, I promptly threw it away. This product is manufactured in China. I'm not saying that it may have lead paint or anything like that, but it's better to be safe than sorry.All in all, they're very durable food items and fun. Just regularly check for chips in the paint to be safe."
3,Fair play kitchen food,I love or really like most of the Melissa and Doug line of toys but I would not buy this one again. It's made in the same fashion but not that fun. The objects are fairly randomly chosen for the set and boring at best. Go for the cookies rather than this set. Or buy Green Toys Pizza set! We play with that at least 4 times a day!
4,Needs a Lid!,The only reason I gave this four stars is because it does not come with a lid which makes it very hard to store. My daughter does love this product though and plays with it everyday. I also got a great price at Christmas when it was on sale. If your child loves being a chef they will love this set.
4,Good Choice,"I bought this for my 2.5 year old and he loves playing with it. The velcro helps keep his creations together, which is needed because most of the ingredients are very thick and a simple sandwich quickly becomes too big for his little hands.Besides the slices being so thick, which I guess is needed to keep them from breaking easily, I wish there were compartments in the wooden box to help keep it looking neater. It always looks like just a bunch of stuff thrown in a box and that does bother me. We have other wooden sets from Melissa and Doug and they do have compartments so I don't understand why this one does not."
4,Awsome!,If your kids likes to actually try to eat thier play food. These products are great for you! I also have the Step 2 101 piece and within a day or soo he already had a quite a few chewed! Other than that he plays with the wooden food so much more! This was worth every penny to use with his toy grill!
3,Not so Durable,"Thought these would be great for play, especially in my daughter's play house. However, the paint on these is not long wearing. The paint has chipped off and peeled away after getting wet outside and my son using them as a teething toy for short durations before you see that he has found them.Not what you really want. Surprised as the Melissa and Doug toys are usually pretty great quality."
5,Excellent toy my son loves at a great sale price,"melissa and doug are great quality toys that are way overpriced for what they are, but at 50+% OFF more than worth it!"
3,Living the Dream,"Mr. Antony's account of his family's struggle to live out their dream offers great inspiration...and a good dose of reality. I very highly recommend the book to anyone who has toyed with dreams of making a living in the country and getting back to the basics. Who knew it was so hard to grow and sell azaleas while living in the Blue Ridge Mountains? I realized the book had me hooked when I discovered I was getting really irritated at their frustrations with local contractors (and literally had to put the book down for a couple hours), and when I found myself secretly rooting for all of Mr. Antony's personally engineered innovations (what we might call ""workarounds""). The tone of the book is that of a really interesting relative or friend relating his family's story to you - the drama comes not so much from their unique ups and downs (and there are plenty), but from the way in which pull of the dream gets them through."
5,An inspirational and enjoyable partial memoir,"By nature, I'm a bit skeptical of books of this nature. But having said that, I must say that Mr. Antony quickly won me over with his honesty and humility. I tremendously enjoyed the thought processess, trials, tribulations, and joys that he describes -- what an amazing life, and what an amazing family. If this book doesn't provide an impetus to do just a little more with the short amount of time we're given, then I don't know what does."
5,Writing & Publishing Personal Essays,"Sheila Bender's updated and extended edition of Writing and Publishing Personal Essays includes solid instructional information and writing exercises for the beginning writer and the published writer. Chapters start with a ""write question."" For example, The Description Essay chapter begins with ""Write Question #1: For what, person, place, event, or object do I have strong feelings of love or of hate?"" She explains the elements of good description essays, provides examples, notes why an essay works well, and guides the reader through effective exercises to discover material for their essays. Her positive tone and nurturing approach helped me develop drafts and then polish them into publishable essays by following her three-step response and revision method. Work your way through this book and you'll be ready for Chapters XI and XII, Prepare the Fruit for Market, and Trucking the Fruit to Market."
4,"Under-rated artwork , worthy of more recognition and airplay","Dionne accomplished a rare feat among recording artists: she covered her own material beautifully. I thought the arrangements were well worked, the selection of songs to cover were good (A+ for ""Reach Out For Me"" and ""I Say A Little Prayer For You"" but B- for ""Walk On By"" as there was not much new to it, and besides the positive message of the lyrics ""All Kinds Of People"" wasn't necessary. The work was underated due in part to the prejudice folk in the radio media have toward Dionne's affinity toward the psych stuff, as well as her work on the album with hip-hop/rap artist (which I thought was well done). All in all the album gets **** from me."
1,A pamphlet of the crudest sort,"Entirely useless for those who need a quick, encyclopedia-like idea of what this multivalent word actually means. For a reader looking for what the series promises - an introduction - it appears as a confusing hodge-podge of quotes from works of fiction, information about Algerian rai music which the author raves about like a teenager, all-too-familiar diatribes about pet causes of Attac and their ilk (evil companies exploiting hapless Africans etc.). It drips with political correctness of a mind-numbingly simplistic sort, embraces the rallying cries of postcolonialism (as a political movement) without the slightest hint of distance or criticism or, indeed, without even as much as discussing the merits of the claims in question. This book is a pamphlet of the crudest sort, by no means a work of scholarship."
1,Waste paper,"Book is uninteresting and bad structured. It isn't clear, what is target group of this book. It isn't good neither for students, nor for scientists, and even nor for housewives. Save your money not buying this book."
2,Doesn't Deliver,"This is the sort of book that you really want to like, but in the end, it just doesn't deliver.Kinky Friedman is a unique American character whom we all wish we could have as a friend, and share laughs over beers. When he is on his game, his outrageous sense of humor can simultaneously amuse and irritate, and he doesn't care whom he offends or befriends. Life would be duller without the Kinkster, but his talent raises expectations that this collection of essays does not meet. Sadly, in this book he seems to be just coasting, and resting on his iconoclastic reputation. Your fans deserve better, Kinky."
4,Entertaining as usual,"Kinky's book is a fast read, as is a lot of his work..the time is spent in contemplating some of the ideas put forth. Funny in a lot of places, material I've seen before in a few, 'stop and make you think' comments in places - it's a good pass time peppered with a few real 'gems'. I enjoyed it. A good book for a trans-pacific flight; bring another one for the trip back - you'll be finished with this one before you get there..."
3,A refreshing alternative,"I found this recording to be a refreshing alternative to the plethora of Mirella Freni and/or Pavarotti versions. Yes, there are flaws, such as occasionally uneven performances from Rodolfo and Musetta, but Kiri Te Kanawa's Mimi more than made up for any weak spots, in my opinion. This isn't the definitive version, but for fans of Kiri Te Kanawa or La Boheme, it's well worth it."
2,Almost good,"The faith themes didn't have much of anything to do with the book, which made them easy to skim over. They did absolutely nothing to forward the plot, and seemed kind of crammed in there. I don't mind faith themes at all when they have something to do with the story. This just seemed forced.A lot of the police work didn't seem realistic, either. I highly doubt police officers so close to the victims would be so involved in investigations. It's like writing about a surgeon operating on their own family. It just isn't done.The ending was just kind of... meh. It's like she got tired of writing so just ended it. It was free, though, so no big worry. It was disappointing because there was a lot that could have been done that just never happened. I deleted it after I read it."
1,Disappointing,"The beginning started out interesting; then character development just didn't really happen as the focus became more on the romance; and the story line dragged and the dialog became repetitive. I will read it through to the end as I'm already 70% committed. This was not what I expected in light of the ratings it received. I was expecting sympathetic characters in line with Girl w/Dragon Tattoo, Hunger Games, even Twilight and The Hostess. I could not buy into the characters--they are all too nice and unreal--kinda made me want to gag. People really don't think/speak in full dialog as this writer depicts. I would summarize that this is a Reader's Digest read: a Harlequin romance trying to be a detective story. I seriously doubt I would read anything by Dee Henderson again after this flop."
2,Needs a good edit,"I found the first portion of this novel to be a page turner. The set up hooked me and the characters were interesting. Unfortunately, that impression didn't last. I didn't see character development and some of the dialogue was cumbersome. The more I read, the more frequently I discovered misuse of words, missing words, and incorrect capitalization and punctuation. I'm not sure if that's because I was more engaged in the beginning and it didn't matter or if the errors occur more frequently as the story evolves. I downloaded it for free and I'm thankful."
2,Didn't engage me,"I haven't finished this book; I tried for a while. The book begins with Luke's point of view, but the author doesn't really allow us to see his personality or motives. We only know what he's thinking from a police officer's point of view. We have no idea whatsoever what is going on within Amanda's head. This means that she is as much a mystery to us as to Luke, and that can be a good thing. For me, that meant that the novel was just too slow-moving. Some authors can make you believe in far-fetched conspiracies or mysteries, but for me, I just couldn't buy into the fact that Amanda was on the run because she had information for the feds (turn it over, already!) and that, while on the run, she just happened to end up working in a retail store where a mass murder takes place. I couldn't buy in, and I couldn't get involved with the characters, so I gave up."
3,An overall good read.,"I read Dee's O'Malley series and loved it. I enjoyed this one but didn't get in to the characters as much, but they were okay. I always enjoy that her writing is not preachy."
2,Not well written,"I have had a few different friends in the past who have raved about Dee Henderson's writing to me. So, when I saw this book available for free on my Kindle, I decided to check her out. Well, this was an awful book to try her out as an author for the first time! I liked the first chapter, and then after that, it just kept going more and more downhill. I am a fast reader if I like a book, and this book took me weeks to plod through. I kept going hoping it would get better, but it never did. It just felt so fake and unrealistic. I am ok with books being unrealistic like Lord of the Rings, Narnia, etc. However, this is not unrealistic like fantasy or SciFi. It's unrealistic like characters that are difficult to become emotionally attached to or believe in. Also, I love a book with twists and turns, but I thought a twist she threw into the story also helped ruin the book for me. I would not recommend this book to a friend, even if it was offered for free again!"
1,B-o-r-i-n-g!!!!!,"This is the worst book I've ever read! Total waste of my time. I'll say it again, EXTREMELY BORING!!!"
2,Bad Grammar,How does such bad grammar get past an editor? This book is so poorly written that it mars the story.I didn't realize this was Christian fiction when I started the book. I shy away from sermonizing.The story line kept me reading but I can't say the book is memorable. It ended with a whimper.
4,An entertaining suspense romance novel,"The sign of an entertaining book is if you read it within a couple of days. I enjoyed Dee Henderson's book, The Witness, and look forward to reading another soon.I'm wondering Marsh and Caroline will get together, or perhaps Susan will be the woman in the wings. Who knows? Perhaps that will be the next in the series."
2,average stats?,How can so many people give it two stars and it winds up averaging five? Is this the new math? lol
2,"Excitement, Yawn, Excitement, Yawn","The beginning was very exciting. The characters interesting. Story line ok. But....there was way too much boring, unimportant, fluff within the story line. I had to skip much of the blah blah blah in order to stay awake."
5,Absolutely Awesome,The witness is one of those books you want to know the ending but you never want to stop reading. There were a few shockers that I did not anticipate - wanted it to be different but I think that added to the intrigue of the story. Would recommend to anyone who wants a great book.
5,GREAT READ,"Enjoyable book. I laughed and cried while reading it. I did hope Caroline would get together with Daniel, but the rest of the story turned out in a good way. I enjoyed reading it."
2,Could have been a great novel!!,The story jumps around considerably and then to kill off one of the sisters...that was the best the author could do. It was such an obvious story from start to finish and very unbelieveable.
1,Not even close to reality,"I read the whole book, but definitely did not enjoy it. The characters seemed fake. The religious parts seemed like an after thought and were unnecessary. Needed more editing. It dragged terribly in the middle. There were way too many relationships going on at the same time. Definitely glad I got it for free -- do not pay full price for this book."
2,The witness,"This was just not up to par with many of her other books so I was kind of disappointed. It seems like the book was never reviewed by an editor. I found so many mistakes that it made it hard to concentrate on the story. I'm not perfect myself, but i've read her books before and i know she can do better than that. It was like someone else wrote the book, but used her name. I've read almost all of Dee Henderson's books and I have to say I love them. However, The Witness was very disappointing for me. It's not that the story was terrible. It was alright. I just feel it was written poorly."
3,Good but dragged on,I forced myself to finish this book. It was an interesting plot but it dragged on in the middle. I didn't connect with the main characters enough and the ending was not satisfying.
1,Maybe It's Me?,"I read ""Danger in the Shadows"" and really enjoyed it. I quickly grabbed this book when Kindle offered it for free.I'm 29% into it and I have to stop.The story started out very strong and it went down hill quickly after the first couple of chapters. The story seems to be jumping and there are scenes that seem to be missing.SPOILER:******At one point, Marie tells a cop about her missing sister .. she thinks she's dead .. we know from the beginning that she's not, she's running and doesn't want her family in danger.The Chief of Police knows she alive and struggles whether or not to tell Marie ... my problem: all of a sudden, Marie knows. There seems to be a major missing scene where she's told thather sister is still alive. I actually went back 3 chapters thinking I missed it. Nope.Again, maybe it's just me, but I was finding myself getting very frustrated."
2,Left me wanting,"I've read most the O'Malley series,having discovered Dee Henderson late. Those I liked, this one I didn't. It was so slow and dragged out, repeating the same scenes over and over. I think the author could be a bit more realistic and still keep the story clean. ""What would you like to drink"" never included a nice cold beer or a glass of wine. Now I've seen pastors of churches buying their 6 packs, so I know they DO drink. How realistic was this long, long story without a suggestion of stopping off for a cold beer?The plot of the story was a bit hard to swallow. How she managed to run constantly for 8 years, pick up work, transportation with little money is beyond comprehension. Oh that's right Sam was her silent partner.I thought the crack homicide detectives were a bit slow and late following up on the reporter that had facts he shouldn't have.If there is a sequel, I don't care to read it."
4,Dee Henderson delivers another excellent story.,Dee Henderson keeps you hanging on to what is going on in this story of secrets and what can happen when a lot of money is involved. There is heartache and joy as well as a lot of tension in the story. It will keep you going. This story does go into a little detail of what life can be like for someone who suddenly finds themselves with more money than many of us could imagine. The intrigue keeps the pages turning.
2,Disappointing,"I am definitely a Dee Henderson fan (her O'Malley series was fantastic), but THE WITNESS does not live to standards. Too many undeveloped characters, a contrived plot chock-full of ridiculous coincidences, and a bummer of an anti-climatic finale - none of those ingredients combine to make a good read in either suspense or romance."
1,poor editing,"interesting premise, but this book desperately needs a good editor to fix the grammatical errors and cut through the extraneous nonsense."
4,"Slow at first, but it kept me going.",I must admit that this book was a bit slow at first with the main characters being developed which made it to follow. I didnt really like how the book ended though...it could have had a more happier ending. It did keep me reading tho because i really wanted to know how the whole thing was gonna play out.
4,Excellent,This was an amazing book that had me hooked from the very first page. It is full of suspense and it doesn't give away anything unless you really think about the clues.
3,Better than most - but unsatisfying,"I have always loved Dee Henderson books for their wonderful character depth. While this book has a good story, there are so many characters to be developed that you don't get to spend enough time with any of them. I wasn't ""dissatisfied"" with the book as much as ""unsatisfied"" because I had expected so much more."
2,Disappointing,"If you love the O'Malley Series, don't even pick this one up. The depth, and character develpment so wonderfully dispalyed in the O'Malley Series in missing in this book. It seems the author was rushed, and didn't get a complete story prior to publishing."
1,superficial book,"I dont write reviews, but I had to on this book.I got it for free on kindle store, but still, this is a book that is sold for normal price. it felt like a story that got zero thinking into making it:not enough details on many occasions, makintg the story confusing and just doenst go into any level of detail many times, I felt like I cant get attached to any character.The relationships were insane, non believable and made me feel like its a joke, yeah right 3 detectives on one case all dating 3 ladies from that case.. even thier chats and private moments felt fake.the action or thriller in the root of the story didnt catch on to me, I didnt feel like it was planned well in the story and it was an afterthought, no suspense, not enough detail on the final stages..even the ending felt empty, I felt happy that I finished reading this one and am ready for something else, but when a good book is done, you think about it a while.. i didnt."
4,You'll love it,"I was staying with a friend a few years ago, I asked if she had something to read, she handed me a Dee Henderson book. That's all she wrote. I had never really been in to the suspense books prior to that first one. I've read almost all of hers and have moved on to Ted Dekker, Randy Alcorn, & of course there's always Frank Peretti.The Witness is a good stand-alone book. Someone complained about the lack of character development. It didn't appear to me that it was the first in a series. Just because the author has written books that happen to end up being apart of a series, doesn't mean all of them need to be.I look forward to new adventures that Dee Henderson will take me on!"
3,better than the o'malley's,"I was very hesitant to waste my time with another Henderson book after trying to stay awake during the O'Malley series, but it was free and sounded like an actually good plot line.surprisingly, it was much better written than the other books I've read of hers and did seem to be written for adults instead of pre-teens.little dragged out in the middle but worth the price."
2,Disappointed reader,"I've read almost all of Dee Henderson's books and I have to say I love them. However, The Witness was very disappointing for me. It's not that the story was terrible. It was alright. I just feel it was written poorly. It seems like the book was never reviewed by an editor. I found so many mistakes that it made it hard to concentrate on the story. I'm not perfect myself, but i've read her books before and i know she can do better than that. It was like someone else wrote the book, but used her name."
3,Not her best,"I love Dee Henderson's books especially the O'Malley series but this one wasn't as interesting. I usually read her books through in one sitting and this one I skipped to the end to find out what happened b/c the middle didn't interest me. It seemed to drag on more than necessary and it was hard switching between the three main story lines. If you're a fan of Dee Henderson, I recommend reading it but it's not one of my favorites."
1,Wretched software,"I purchased this software to brush up on my algebra skills before taking a calculus class. Titles were limited since I use a Mac, so this was just about my only choice. What a complete waste of money. The interface is terrible and the level of instruction isn't much better. The ""tutor"" for the more advanced levels has such heavy accent that I relied on the captions for instruction. I found several math errors in the program - not good! The sound doesn't work for some sections, and no, it wasn't my computer. I couldn't be more disappointed. I purchased several books from the McGraw Hill Demystified series, which while not as ""high-tech"", are vastly superior. I would guess that any of the written Algebra study guides would be better than this software, and be much cheaper!"
3,So-So,"I don't know if I'd go as far as the reviewer below but I have to agree that it's not the best. I got it to help my 15 year old son in Algebra. It isn't interactive. But... he is sitting at the PC using it now. I said, ""Hey! Is that software any good."" He said, ""Yeah."" For a 15 year old boy, that a relatively good review. He has also used the software ""High School Success 2007 (which includes Math Success 2007) and he REALLY doesn't like it. Also... he and his sister have ""Algebra Solved"" and it has proven to be of no use to them because they can't figure out how to work it. So far, MATH LEARNING SYSTEM 2007 is about as good as I've found. But oh, would I like to find something better."
4,A quantum text staple,"This classic textbook has been a major reference for both students and people working in the field. For a student, if it is not the text used by the professor, there is probably no need to buy this in addition to anything else. As a working professional, this book is a must. An insightful reference.I used this for one of my graduate courses and it was suitable for that level. The end-of-chapter problems can be quite challenging. For undergraduate courses Griffiths' Quantum Mechanics is more appropriate.As has been said in previous reviews, this text is missing on some key concepts. But what text isnt? This probably has fewer holes than any other text currently out."
1,Good book. Poor quality copy,"I purchased this book for my quantum mechanics class, and I have to say that the text is a pleasure to read. It is informative, and it actually tries to approach some of the underlying concepts of quantum mechanics. The author has done a phenomenal job. My critique however, must be very harsh overall. Many pages fall out the first time I turn them. The books spine is in 3 distinct layers of: The outer cover, a thick layer of glue, pages. The fact that glue and pages do not really overlap is very disheartening. The quality of the publishing is really unacceptable, especially for such a valuable reference book that one should be able to turn back to over and over again. I recommend finding another place to buy this book.NOTE* I recommend the book highly. I do not recommend you purchase from this seller (Amazon). Go to a bookstore and thumb through it a few times to make sure it will hold up. I wouldn't buy it unless you have handled it first."
4,Great book!!!!,"Great book, very easy to read. but for some reason reading the book is not enough for working out the problems. some of them are really hard!!!!!!!!!The best way to take advantage from it, is to read other books at the same time and use this one as the center of your studying."
2,Get another text,"I had to use this book in my graduate quantum class last fall. It is hard to read, has very few examples, and the problems at the end of the chapters seem to have nothing to do with the content of the chapter. I do not understand how this text can be intended for undergraduates without being overwhelming. Plus I don't think you can do many of the problems without reading the extra optional sections. It could have been a lot more descriptive and concise while explaining things better.On the plus side, it has a decent index and the important equations are boxed so they are easy to spot while reviewing."
3,More of a reference than a textbook,"I just finished a graduate level quantum mechanics course where Cohen-Tannoudji's ""Quantum Mechanics"" was the primary text. This work as both strengths and weaknesses. On the plus side, it is as extremely comprehensive and detailed treatment of non-relativistic quantum mechanics as can be found, and makes an outstanding reference work. On the down-side, it took me half of the semester to learn how to find things quickly within the text, and I never felt as if it really helped me learn quantum in the intuitive sense. While the mathematical formalism was there, the language CT used to describe these phenomena seemed lacking. Fortunately, my copy of Sakurai helped me more with these less formal descriptions, and made a welcome complement to Cohen-Tannoudji. While CT may be the most comprehensive text I have seen, I would not recommend it being the only text used for a class."
3,Expensive,"Yeah, books are great, got to me really fast, in mint condition. But they are a kinda expensive..."
1,This book is so bad it hurts!!!,"What's wrong with all you people?!? This book was used in my undergraduate QM course, and I HATED it. Yes, it is very complete and full of stuff, but it is impossible for the beginner to follow. It has NO simple examples to teach the basics. This book had me tripping and stumbling over the material. The thing is so huge it's impossible to read it all or find what you are looking for. This book may be a good reference book, but only a robot could learn QM from it.Quantum Mechanics by Shankar is much more concise, more colloquial, and has examples to bring things home.P.S. I am not stupid! This book stinks!!"
4,A SPLASH!,"This is the second CD of the three disc set: Beach Party, Pool Party and Jungle Jive. This Cd has more instrumentals than the other two CDs (about 2/3). A really good collection of rare tracks from 1963-1965 all from the Del-Fi record company. If you are a fan of The Ventures or any cool retro lounge music, this Cd is worth owning. Best tracks-Watusi Bongos, Wild Twist, Here Comes Ringo (a great Beatles ""tribute"" or parody-I don't know which), Come On Let's Go, Mack the Knife (instrumental), and Swim Beat. The packaging is very well done and the set looks cool together-so pick up all three CDs."
3,Could be a lot better...,"The book isn't really useful unless you have a firm grasp on how to work on Volvo's. The illustrations are poorly done and the steps are really vague. The condition I got my book in wasn't great, the pages were stained with oil and some were so bad you couldn't even read them.The book DID help me fix a few odds and ends, but I wish I had gotten a different one."
3,Haynes Repair Manual evaluation,"It is a good, but I am sorry to say that its contents are not enough, something shortage of description and something lack of data."
3,Scan codes for automatic transimission are missing,"Good book, lots of useful info. However I'm disappointed that in automatic transmission chapter, it says ""when you get flashing arrow, use computer codes in section 9 for troubleshooting"". I turn pages and see that section 9 does not exists.I mean ""what the hell"". I have to search for another book now."
2,It's ok...,Lacks depth. Wiring diagrams very limited. I used Haynes before on a Dodge and the book was much better.
3,What a shame Act 3 was lost,"Charpentier was arguably the most talented French Composer during the years of the Sun King, but was sidelined by the politically savvy Italian born Lully, and as a result we have many sacred pieces, but only one secular opera - Medee, and a few divertissments and ballets.What we have here is the first CD recording of one of these smaller domestic divertissments - based on the ever-popular Orfeo legend. Unfortunately however Act 3 was lost and Christie here presents the truncated first 2 acts. As you'd expect Christie and his soloists are flawless - This is just as good as any of Christie's recordings since joining the Erato label.Other recordings of Charpentier's secular music include Les Arts Florrisants (the piece from which Christie's ensemble took its name) on the budget HMA label, La Malade Imaginaire on HMC, Le Pierre Philosophal on Erato, and an ongoing series by Gary Cooper on ASV."
5,Great story and high morals too,My daughter loved this (age 11). A well produced tale with a good cast. Well acted and thought through. Well worth the money and our vote is for you to own it too
4,Great to Watch Together,"I watched this with my ten-year-old daughter, and doing so is a great way to open the doors to discussions about bullying, friendship, fitting in, and changes (specifically moving to a new area or a new school)."
2,A misunderstood message about homeschoolers....,"We checked this one out from the library and have enjoyed all the American Girl movies so far. This movies message concerning homeschooling was negative and false. If you decide to homeschool you don't ""lose out"" as Gwen said, you don't fall behind on your grades and lose friends. Come on American Girl what are you thinking? Sounds like you need to take your own movie message and study it further, aren't you being prejudice against homeschoolers? I have taught my children to stand up for themselves, have healthy boundaries with others and respect others with differences. We homeschool just the same it has nothing to do with mean kids possibly at school. Mean kids exist everywhere. It just could've been fairer towards those who homeschool."
5,Amazing!,"This movie is really great! All my friends like it. I would recomend this to anybody! Don't listen to the bad reviews, buy it,rent it. It's a great movie!This review is coming from a kid."
4,"Cute, but Quite Effective","I just watched this with my daughter and her friend and found it quite good and quite charming. Since both girls had recently been bullied (in a different way), I liked how relevant this was. I also enjoyed the ongoing elements of forgiveness, understanding, no one is truly evil, etc (my daughter's now close friends with 2 other kids who used to be her enemies).My only issues (and granted, it's a kids' movie) were the all too cliched and perfect ending and that horrible ""Say Hello"" song at the end! We all made fun of that song for days!"
1,"Rent this movie or check it out from the library, don't buy it.","The reason I give this movie only 1 star is because I wish we hadn't spent our money to buy the movie. It is not a movie that my daughter is going to watch over and over again; once is enough.We couldn't watch the movie on HBO where it first aired. Because my 10 year old daughter is a big fan of American Girl and their movies, we bought it as soon as it came out.I have to say that this is a well made movie, and the acting is very good. I would give the movie 5 stars for that.But, it is a very intense and uncomfortable movie. The bully is relentless and very mean.So, just be warned that you might want to check it out from the library or rent it before you spend the money to buy it!"
1,CAN I RATE ZERO STARS?!? THIS IS JUNK,"Our family is a homeschooling environment and I have 3 girls (all 11 and under) who have enjoyed and benefited by reading the AG series of books. As a family who has enjoyed watching the strong and courageous Christian-value based characters in those series -- this movie was a BIG disappointment.This movie was something spun off the Disney Channel designed to expand marketshare to intrude on the Hannah Montana crowd or something. I was completely disgusted by the attitudes of the girls, and even the fact that Chrissa did what was right did NOT make up for all the negativity in this movie.I would not recommend this movie to anyone who does not appreciate movies with a PG rating or higher. The fact that it premiered on HBO should be a big red flag.And to all the homeschool bashers out there - I see why you may like it... this movie is about YOU."
2,Not my favorite.,"My family likes the other American Girl movies, but this one just didn't cut it. Sorry I bought it."
1,poor,"I ordered the movie for my daughter and the DVD case was empty. I am not sure what happened, but no DVD was on the inside. She was very upset and so was I."
3,Behind the dissonance,"Another smorgasbord of warped can play out merely like schizophrenic scraps, bouncing between free-jazz, avant classical, and atonal noise sporadically, but underneath even the most trying of textural annoyances lies a production and compositional skill easily overlooked from all the apparent randomness. MFC is nowhere near an ideal starting point for this constant recorder, but it will primarily appeal to those already initiated."
2,Not worth that much!,"While it is ""Deluxe"" it isn't that great. It is a lot of wasted space.. I wanted something large and while it is large it's all just empty plastic! We ended up taking this back and buying a wood one.Cons:-The dish holder at top was awful, the plates wouldnt sit up in it.-The drawers were bad too.. not room to put stuff in the kids got frustrated and it was hard to open and close. They were constantly falling out!!-Spaces were small, even though the kitchen was big. Didn't really hold much but it was very bulky.I would highly recommend you look around and see some kitchens in person before spending this much on the kitchen. I much like the wood one we bought better, and the kids love it!"
4,Great kitchen with some drawbacks,"We love this kitchen, but it is not perfect. yes, it has it all. Sink, dishwasher, microwave, fridge, oven and stove. It has a nice starter dishes set and foods to begin with. We didn't buy more dishes, but we bought more food to go along with this kitchen. I give it 4 stars because some of the doors don't close well, drawers fall out easily or get stuck and there is very little counter space. Huge sink but not enough counter space. The dials for the appliances look more like telephone than the appropriate dials, and they make very soft noices. I don't agree with lound toys, but this is REALLY soft. The telephone is cute, but it is also too soft. It is the BEST kitchen I've found and yes we love it, but it could be better hence the four stars."
5,Great for Twins!!,"We got this for our 23 month old b\g twins. They LOVE it!It was a breeze to put together as long as you have a razor blade to clean up some of the pegs/holes and an electric drill. There is more than enough room for both of them to play with it at the same time!We did find it cheaper on LNT's website (we got to use a 20% of coupon their website....even with shipping, it came out cheaper)."
3,Not that great,"I thought my 3 and 1 year old would really love this kitchen. They rather play with the old, small littletikes kitchen I stashed in the basement..they love how the faucet makes noise. They do play with the kitchen a couple times a week. My complaints: The drawers easily fall off and the sounds that the stove and microwave make are dumb and very quiet..it sounds like an UFO toy. My purchase was a toss up between this and LittleTikes cookin fun interactive kitchen..I wish I did pick LTikes."
5,GREAT Kitchen,I got this kitchen for my 2 year old and its GREAT!!!! The kitchen is big enough for her to grow into.. It took 3-4hrs to put togehter. I suggest using a drill to put the kitchen together. As others have said you should also put the stickers on for the window seen and the area behind the dishes before you put it together. The stove makes real life sounds the dish washer and oven noises are a little dull compared to the stove top. The refrig doesn't make any sounds.I think this was a good investment. She will be playing with this until she's atleast 4 or 5.
5,The kitchen I wanted as a kid,"This kitchen is fantastic. Everything is sturdy and I'm sure it will last. There are a good number of drawers and cabinets which my daughter loves because she can rearrage things a lot. The stove, microwave, dishwasher, and oven all have buttons and make noise... also great for a toddler. The phone is supposed to make noise too but I can't get the battery cover off for some reason. Use caution when putting together the white bins... we had a piece of plastic break off of each one of them. Nothing that caused the item to not stay together or function properly, but it was just strange."
1,"Assembly is a nightmare, poor quality materials.","Save your $[...]. This kitchen is a father's worst nightmare come true. A total piece of junk! In addition, I think it is dangerous because the set keeps falling apart. I am promptly returning this product."
4,"very cute, but short","We love this kitchen. The kids play with it and share it nicely. My son is tall and has to bend over or be on his knees. Even then, he has to work around the drying rack that is over the sink and keeps bumping it.Other than that, the kids love it and have spend MANY hours playing with it. It is durable and has everything little kids could want in a kitchen."
4,Callin all little cooks!,"My 4 yr old wanted this for his birthday. It was a 2 person job to assemble and sticker. Construction pretty sturdy for plastic. Fun battery powered features make lights and sounds. Will also be great as baby sister gets older. Overall, a good find if you have the space and patience for clutter."
3,Step2 kitchen,"This kitchen is just ok. After reading all the positive reviews I thought I was getting this GREAT kitchen but that wasn't the case. The oven door doesn't close properly and the sounds for microwave, oven, telephone are very poor. The boiling water sound is the only fun part for my kids and the light on top of the sink (which is constantly on). The pots, pans and accessories are always all over the floor. I would never buy this kitchen again or recommend it to anybody."
5,Just fantastic.,"Can't say enough about this kitchen set.I love how it fits nicely up along the wall( like a bookshelf),and doesn't seem to take up too much floor space.I love all the storage areas in it.The stove making boiling/cooking sounds when batteries are installed is very intertaining to the kids, they use this function all the time.The removable baskets in it are always being loaded up and carried around.This is holding up really well in a daycare setting with 5 children between 2 and 4yrs using it on a regular basis.The best kitchen I have had in my toy room. over the past 15years, This is the 3rd one I have had. We have had this one for around a year now."
1,Tight..,"I had to return due to being real tight around my toes. Looks good, but not a good fit for 11.5M."
2,"Poor quality, uncomfortable, but cheap","Overall, this product doesn't look as good as it does on the site. It had an uncomfortable feel to me, which a lot of chafing on the heel.I'll probably try to break them in further, but overall I believe you'd be better off just spending a bit more on a nicer shoe."
4,Decent shoes,"Shoes are pretty good, take a while to break in. I bought them because they are a good brand at a great price. Hopefully they last a while."
3,Cheap shoes,"The original price for the shoes was 100 dollars, but after the discount, I paid 29 dollars.And when the shoes arrived, I found the shoes look pretty cheap and probably 29 dollars are just their actual value.A little disappointed, since this doesn't seem to be a good deal as it originally looked."
4,Good shoes.,"Fast shipping with exceptional communication as always from Amazon. The shoe is very good looking. It is comfortable, but does require a little breaking in and getting used to, which is usually not necessary with a Rockport product. The back of the shoe has a collar that rubs the back of your achilles a little too much. After getting used to it, the shoe is absoloutely comfortable. If not for the heel issue, I would have rated it a 5 because the shoe looks great!"
2,Comfy fit but......,"This is my first pair of Rockport shoes and I must say, the comfortable fit lived up to expectations. I am however suprised that the exterior of the shoe has aged much quickly than any other dress/casual shoe I've ever worn. After only 2 weeks of wearing these shoes, they have the appearance of a shoe 2 to 3 years old due to the excessive creases on top of the shoe as your toes bend. A noticable crease was forming after only 2 days of wear and has only gotten progressively worse over the 2 weeks that I've owned them. Since these shoes are only $50, the comfort alone may be worthy of the price for a business casual work environment but don't expect these shoes to impress anyone in a social setting."
2,Did not meet expectations,Rockport Men's Downington OxfordDid not meet the expectations.I thought Rockport shoes will use good quality materials. This one is not.Would not recommend both on quality and comfort as well.Bummer. Wasted 35 bucks on these shoes.
4,oldie but goodie,"i think roger moore is a great actor, this is him before 007 its a bit predictable, but hey what isn't"
3,Ok for beginiers,As I said its good for beginners in Land Use field. The book covers history mostly but not very theoretical / scientific history. It only informative history. Again I bought it for a class and referred it for exams.
1,Much too dry and fact oriented,It's my fault really but this book is just not what I was looking for and I could not get through it.
5,My ShihTzu,I have a little Shih Tzu she will be three this month.I have been searching for these little t shaped treats. She has had these since she was apuppy for training purposes potty etc.I have not been able to find any thing else she likes like these little treats.Please start manufacturing them again.Maureen MaroneyNY
4,Bright and pretty,"This is exactly what it says it is - 2 green cathodes.I would have liked it if the cathodes could be unplugged from the inverter, but it's not an issue. Also, the button is a little strange and not easily mounted to the computer... again, not an issue for me.Interesting fact: mixed with my red cathode, this makes yellow. That's not quite what I was hoping for but I think I found a way to isolate the colorsOther than that, great brightness and good efficiency - not to mention no heat!"
3,"Buy, Keep or Sell?",I was not pleased with this book. It is all about British collectables and I couldn't find many items in the book that I have in my collections. I reread the book descriptions and found no wording that said it was all English information.I wasn't pleased with the book. Others might enjoy it.
4,Fierce Shostakovich and a lyrical Prokofiev,"Vadim Repin is an impressive violin player, and here he allows his artistry to shine. He plays with great fire and melancholy on the Shostakovich, leaving an excellent impression. The Prokofiev is less convincing. There is a very plain sense of lyricism to it with which Repin seems uncomfortable. It is still a good performance however."
5,Why Not?,Post Cro...whatever...the point is its brilliant.If you want to hear a band that is revolutionizing music...hear this.
2,I was disappointed,"I felt that this book was poorly written in parts. For, example, I almost laughed out loud at one point where they were speculating about AntiCrist - underestimating him so much because he had poor grammar - gee, he can't write, obviously he must be an uneducated imbecile. The thought never crossed their mind that he could be pretending? Anyway, perhaps McDowell should stick to nonfiction."
2,American Conservatism is NOT the same as Christianity,"In the same way that it would be GREAT to hear an American liberal speak out against abortion as an infringement of human rights, so it would be great to hear an American conservative speak out against capital punishment for the same reason. For us non-Americans there is only despair at the cliched positions of liberals and conservatives in the US. This book simply reinforces this. Homosexuality has killed a lot less people than the American Govt's use of the electric chair/lethal injections, yet McDowell's character doesn't seemed concerned abut this, even given that his Lord, Jesus Christ, was the innocent victim of a state execution.It is time for US Christians to see that what they often espouse as ""Christain"" views on social issues is really just ""American Conservatism"" with a few bible verses thrown in. One suspects that 150 years ago these same people would have supported slavery."
1,Wrong Product,"I ordered the beginner re-breakable board. Upon receipt of the product I found that they shipped me the wrong board. No complaints with Amazon, the service and ease of use were fantastic."
4,Men's GEL-Trail(tm) Attack II,"""Great shoes. A little hard to get on my feet - but once slipped tightly inside- great support. Excellent design."""
4,not so bad!,"My mom got this for my almost 5 year old daughter and she actaully thinks its too fast. So I think the fact that its not as fast as others is a relative issue. My 3-year old boy loves it, and its fast enough for him (he'd ride something faster, no problem, but he's 3 - he doesn't need faster). So, it really depends on how much of a daring your child is. Its called trail blazer, but I don't see that it does the smallest of hills very easily - of course, its only a 6-volt battery - so hill climbing is slower than flat surfaces. I think its great for a first-timer child on motorized vehicles."
2,Great toy-but not worth the money,"We bought this for our daughter's 3rd bday, and my son who was 2 got a boy version(cant remeber the name)but the barbie one didn't go near as fast as his. We have had no problems with it other than its not that fast!! She refuses to ride it and I am hoping to sell and buy her a boy version!! One with two speeds. Why don't they make girl ones that go faster?"
1,Needs help.,"I am in total agreement that Fisher Price Power Wheels is ""sexist"" as put by another reviewer above. These are much too slow, even for the most timid little girl! We took ours back and got our 3-year-old the Kawasaki for boys. It is sooo much better and I wish they would wake up and read these reviews and do something about it. I'd love to spend whatever to get my little girl a quad ride on that lets her keep up with her older brother on his! It's obvious a change should be made after reading all these reviews! Come on Fisher Price!"
4,Barbie Trailrider,"We purchased this Barbie quad for our 4 yr. old daugher and were very unhappy with the performance. With a 6 volt battery it hardly pulled her through the grass (she is an average 40lb. 4 year old). Our two year old son was the perfect size for this toy. It had enough power to pull our daughter on the driveway, but anymore than 25-30lbs. is too much for the voltage of this particular ride-on. If you're looking for a ride-on for a child over 3yrs. of age I strongly recommend spending the extra money to get one with a 12-volt battery. It makes all the difference!!Ours was ridden (mostly by our son) for only one summer and it will hopefully be sold in a garage sale soon. Live and learn!!!"
1,found something better,I have been searching for a power wheels that my 5 year old could ride. Her skinny legs are too long for the jeep so I had to purchase something that would allow for this. I thought of buying the Barbie Trailblazer but I noticed that it only goes to 3.5mph. I bought the Dora ATV it has 2 speeds 2.5 and 5.0 mph with a 12 volt battery.I will let you know how it goes. (Santa is delivering it). Thanks to the reviews I steered clear of this purchase.
4,My 16-month-old daughter loves this book...,"The illustrations are charming, sort of ""old-fashioned"" and fun to look at for kids and adults alike. I laud Melissa and Doug for not giving kids the typical cartoony stuff! My daughter goes to her bookshelf and asks for this book (by pointing to it) regularly. She loves to take the pieces out and tell me what the pictures are of, and then she carries them around with her so she can look at them at her leisure. One word of warning: my toddler likes to put the pieces in her mouth, so close supervision is a must."
4,great puzzle,"My [...] loves puzzle. and flipping the pages. Very sturdy peices, even though they have gone in her mouth a few times, I still love this puzzle book and am very suprised at the negative comments. If your child likes puzzles and flipping pages this is for you!"
2,Lost Pieces,"If pieces get lost (as they likely will), the manufacturer, Melissa & Doug, does not offer replacement pieces. When I inquired about replacement pieces, they responded, ""Our puzzles and toys are all cut by hand, and when the items are hand cut, the dimensions of each piece can vary slightly from puzzle to puzzle, and toy to toy. If we were to send you the missing pieces, they more than likely wouldn't fit into your puzzle, since they weren't originally cut for your puzzle. For that reason, we don't keep any extra pieces in our inventory."" Although I generally like Melissa & Doug products, I would be more inclined to recommend it if I knew I could replace lost pieces."
3,Fun but you need to play near a fridge,As many reviewers stated before me this is a toy that needs supervision. My daughter is almost two and she does enjoy this book but we play next to a metallic surface so she has somewhere to put her magnets. It is not a puzzle I will let her play alone as I do not like to look for the missing pieces. I did wash one piece in the washing machine (she stuck it in her pocket) and it came out pretty much the same so it is very durable. Not to mention that I bought it at a garage sale and have owned for it about 6 months. It will be a bonding time for yu and your child though!
4,A Helping Hand with Great Ideas,"This is a terrific place to start when one is planning a garden. The book contains various layouts and ideas for different types of gardens, including garden rooms, planting for privacy, putting in a water garden as well as composting and testing your soil. Although Ms. Lovejoy does include a small section on condo gardening or those with limited space this book is really geared towards those who own their own homes and have some property. This book is loaded with beautiful photos on almost every other page but unfortunately none of the plants are identified within so you will need a companion book to identified the plants, shrubs and trees pictured. That task itself may be very difficult."
3,All in one box,"The battery was a great inclusion of this kit.The memory case is sort of clumsy, sticks are difficult to remove, the hinge won't last long, also: the memory sticks come in a case already when purchased. It would be better if a ""case"" for multiple sticks would comprehend the size including the box they come in.The camera case is really not much - - - it appears heavier than the camera(!) and yet has no ""bulk"", the strap is not very good -- too light. Nevertheless, it's useful and handy.Overall just slightly disappointing, but still a good combination of items to get your ""stuff"" organized."
4,Glad someone had it,I've been looking for this album for years now and finally found a reprint here on Amazon. Very happy with the shipping time - the packaging could have been a bit better since it's a jewel case. It arrived damaged but the disc was unharmed.Overall happy with the exp.
3,Service,I cannot fairly evaluate this product because I did not keep it. I originally ordered it because there was a snag with my ordering it from my school library. I received the book from them so I returned the one I got on Amazon.com. The service was excellent and my refund was processed expeditiously.
3,genev,"Thomas Boston reminds the reader that Matthew 11:28 should not be seen as an invitation but rather as a divine command. Every person must serve one of two masters: either God or the devil. He encourages the reader by noting that--""There is hard labor in digging stones, as well as digging for gold; nay, it is hard labor digging disappointments, that which is not; whereas the gain of the other is precious and certain.""""What a mad thing is it to be working out our damnation, instead of our own salvation!""""...the law exacts perfect obedience, but gives no strength; Christ, when claiming obedience to his law, gives strength for the performance, which makes it an easy obedience."""
5,Fits great,"This was a perfect fit for our last bottle whose threads somehow endedup stripped. If you are thinking of a replacement, just be sure that you havethe correct top opening as there are many dispensers that this would be be toosmall for."
3,Not the right product,"Due to a drawn picture rather than an actual picture, I was unable to get the correct product. Otherwise it's ok"
3,So-so,It offers an okay review...and okay practice tests. But it doesnt go over the dbq's and test format really well.
1,This game [is bad],"We rented this game thinking that it was a NFL-Blitz style game--full contact, bash em up golf. We were sorely disappointed. There is very little fighting in it, and what little 'beatings' there are cannot be controlled by the player. Besides that, the control is very hard to use and ultimately frustrating. This is one of the worst games on GameCube. If you want a good golf game, get Tiger Woods 2003."
1,EUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGHHHHHHHH!! :P,"this game TOTALLY [STUNK]!!! it is the absoolute worste game ive ever played in my life! it takes 4eva to load, the graphics are horrible, and basically it was soooooo borin that i took it back the next day before i had to shoot myslef from boredom! NEVER EVER buy this game you will definetly regret it and it is a total waste of time!!!"
1,Be careful!,"Be careful using the phrases of this book in other German speaking countries than Germany. Especially Austrians won't like, or in several cases not even understand, many phrases, since the slangs in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and so on are really different!"
3,Not What I Expected,"This book is poorly organized and doesn't really have the type of slang that you will hear in Germany today. Maybe it is just my experiences with the German people, but most of the things in this book are almost never said. There are a few good parts in it, but overall I think Barron missed the mark on this one."
2,Better for CD than DVD,"Kaibaivanska is no Cio Cio San. She acts and sings more like an 18th century empress from eastern Europe. There is exactly zero attempt to portray a poor Japanese teenager in the 20th century. It is no match for the Anna Moffo version, which is in a class by itself."
1,unsatisfied,I am very unsatisfied. I live in Denmark and ordered a dvd from my adress here. I got a dvd which cannot be seen in our systems! I lost my money and I cannot watch the product. This is not a good way to serve your customers!
3,Madama Butterfly Giacono Puccini/Netherlands Opera,The Music was great and singers were also great.The sets were awful. I can't think of any thing else to say.
3,"Visually nice, musically adequate, but dramatically flat","I ordered this performance of Madama Butterfly based on another reviewer's positive comments, because I was looking for a version that has acceptable qualities visually, musically, and dramatically to make available to students in my Intro to Opera course. The production is visually nice in terms of the sets and costumes; however, I found the large number of singers on stage in the first act during the wedding to be chaotic and distracting. Every movement of feet on the stage can be heard. Musically, I feel the performance is adequate -- not great, but not bad either. I was most disappointed in the acting and dramatic delivery of the singers. I found the acting to be very one-dimensional (especially Kaibaivanska as Butterfly), flat, and lacking in emotion. The prinicipal singers had their eyes on the conductor so much that very little came across as natural or believable."
5,antique furniture must have,We have been collecting antique furniture for several years as we come across pieces we find attractive. I have been reading MR Taylors column on antique furniture and restoration for a number of years and have been impressed with his vast knowledge in this area. I bought this book to help identify some of the pieces we have bought and to gain a better understanding on general construction methods used to date furniture over the years. Book has lots of reference pictures as well as good information. Highly recommended.
3,It is ok,"This pan is ok... and to be honest I bought it because it was yellow and love to add funky objects to my kitchen collection. I used this to roast my very first Thanksgiving turkey. It did a good job, and I like that it can double as a large pan for school or work goodies.Some down sides to this product is that it is pretty lightweight and you can not use it above 400 degrees - which was a downer when I was going to make gravy using the pan drippings.If I had to buy it all over again I probably wouldn't. It is NOT worth $40..."
5,Another great live album from the Crows,"I have had the double cd set, Across a Live Wire in New York, in my car for years. I have now replaced those 2 cds with this one. I love Counting Crows live. Their songs work so well acoustically, and Adam's voice is so spot on, live or otherwise. I highly recommend this cd if you are a fan of their live shows. I have seen them live and I own all of their albums, and this cd really captures the essence of their shows and songs."
4,For lovers of Counting Crows,"Of course if you love Counting Crows, you are obligated to get this CD. It's nice to hear some of the ""old school"" songs like Perfect Blue Buildings and Omaha, and there is some newer stuff as well. I was expecting more than a less-than-three-minute new release (Hazy), but even his old stuff is slightly different than what is on the other CD's. Given that this is a live CD Adam of course changes up his songs (as he always does at his concerts). I can never get enough of this band, and I would highly recommend this CD."
3,"Not bad, not great","I'm a big Counting Crows fan. Up until now, I've loved everything they've done. But this new live cd falls short for me.Most of the tracks are okay. But they aren't spectacular. I loved the versions of ""Rain King"" and ""Catapult,"" but the rest didn't do much for me. And I really don't like this version of ""Hanginaround."" I usually like when Adam switches up the melody, but in ""Hanginaround"" he is just off key, and it sounds bad.For a better live album, pick up ""Across a Wire."" And if you want more than that, get the bootleg of the Denver show from the ""This Desert Life"" tour. Those are both much better than this."
2,"""Rain King"" Sounds Like a Funeral March - and it follows from there","Was looking forward to some live, energetic versions of some of my favorite songs. I consider myself a fan, but at times, this album is painful. Often it sounds like Duritz doesn't even want to be there. If this was a true bootleg, maybe I could understand, but with three nights of recording to cull the best work, this really comes up short."
4,no long review,for all the Counting Crows fans... this CD just rocks. Its a must have for your CD collection.
2,"It's a great performance and all, but ONE freaking hit","Are you kidding me?! It's a great performance and all, but ONE freaking hit or remotely recognizable song (""Hanginaround) out of 15?! They don't even perform ""Mr. Jones."" Wasn't the idea to have this show in New Amsterdam spawned from the opening line of that song? Would be better off as an internet only release, rather than a Nation-wide one."
1,Worst customer service .. ever,"You are on your own if you buy anything from smooth!Late shipping? no problem, they think it's ok to ship within 3 months, although they charge your credit card the next day of ordering!Not satisfied with the product? no problem, you can return it within 30 days!But first you have to back it in the original package the same way it was, which is like impossibleThen they will deduct 20% for restockingThen another $150 for shippingThen you'll have to pay for shipping back , another $150 at least!This is a total of $700 yo loose, who dares to return?So it's better to leave with all the squicking and cracking, it was your fault in the 1st place that you bough it before reading REAL customers reviews"
4,Smooth CE 3.2 Elliptical,Assembly and setup were a breeze. It comes with all the necessary tools beautifully and orderly packaged with the parts visually numbered. Excellent display and ride. It glides like Gym 4K comercial Elliptical.
5,Excellent piece of equipment,"I am surprised at some of the reviews on here. I have owned this machine for almost 5 years with no issues. I love it and feel I have definitely gotten my money's worth. I think it is pretty common to need some adjustments if you put it together yourself. I had to have someone come out shortly after I put it together to take care of a noise, but since then it has been perfect. I did a lot of research and smooth is a great brand elliptical to purchase!"
5,This is smoooooth...,"The Smooth Fitness elliptical machine is an affordable and flexible exerciser every bit as good as any I have used in commercial clubs. It was easy to put together--a little heavy, but that makes it stable--two people can move it nicely and I got it going by myself. It has a solid feel, good variety of computer-generated workout options with timing and wireless heart rate monitor. I like the 18"" stride, the handles for upper body work while ""walking"", the computer that remembers both users (wife & me) and easily changes between exercise options. A good-looking piece of equipment that works as advertised, smoothly and solidly. I can certainly recommend this for the ""indoor runner/walker."""
5,A Straightforward Introduction,"The authors introduce the most elementary ideas of probability theory in quite a few pages. They include the right amount of examples to clarify the concepts without making the exposition too tedious. In addition, the text has plenty of problems with their respective solutions. To make the story short: if you want to learn elementary probability as fast as possible without loosing the essentials, get this book."
4,Better than its follow up statistics book.,This is a good book. Better than its follow up statistics book in accomplishing its goal imo. However recent price hiking on the new text by the publisher ruins its value. If you are getting a 12 dollar used copy you are getting a good value. If you are getting a 135 dollar new copy you are getting fleeced or forced into a horrible purchase by an instructor.
3,It's good enough,"I'm a utility cyclist, and needed a utility bag in which to carry tools, spare parts, my rain cape, gloves, cloth grocery totes from the co-op, etc. For my summer bike (a now-elderly mixte-frame tourer) I also plan to make four flapped pannier bags on the musette model, and wanted to see whether I'd need to do it from scratch or could adapt existing bags.Once I modified the bag by transforming the backpack-style straps into a single purse-style shoulder strap, the pack's been working quite well for carrying my kit. It seems sturdy and is very nearly capacious enough (it ends up being stuffed rather full). I need to install quick-release buckles on the flap instead of the metal thread-the-needle ones, but that's the only real annoyance. The price was fair enough.But it'd be more work than it's worth to transform it into a pannier, so I expect I'll buy yards of canvas and create them from scratch instead."
5,Excellent book on God's presence,"Gregg Braden's book presents a very enticing theory regarding God's name encoded in human DNA. The book is not written in a manner that flows as well as his other books, but the idea merits serious attention. I have always maintained that God sends a different message through each religious tradition so that no one tradition has the corner on Truth. Therefore, I have no problem with this particular revelation being connected with the Hebrew language and no other. I believe this is only the threshold of what we will learn as we discover the actual interrelationships between science and spirituality."
4,God Code Review,"As a seer, I have received information for almost 30 years that we are each an individualization of God and God is actually the sum total of all. I am happy to read in Gregg's work that he has discovered scientific evidence of this fact which I hope will motivate readers to turn within to find their own divinity as opposed to seeking it from an outside source."
1,The God code,"The author's claim of ""12 years research"" snagged me, and within a couple of chapters I put the book down rather disappointed. Intelligent design is the thrust of this book;what an irony."
1,Note for God Code,"I have read some of Gregg's work before, but this one often goes astray. Although his facts are interesting and insiseve, his logic often becomes scrambled as he tries to illustrate each of his creative attempts to foremulate a point."
4,God is love. Love is all we need.,Written in great detail. Explanations broken down point by point made it easier for anyone to comprehend. Loved it. Enlightening.
2,Strange Book,I was excited to get this book...And I am all for the concept...But the book is extreemly wordy and really goes off on too many directions for me...Although I am a spirital believer that we all come from one source - I am not sure his particlar mechanics on how this is manifested is adaquatly proven in the book either...You almost get the feeling that the author is trying to fill pages...After about 1/3 way through the book - i have resorted to just reading the Chapter summaries - which are good...I will update this review when I am finished reading it.
5,The God Code,"Amazing documentation of ancient language linking god with chemical composition of biosphere and living cells.Succinct, clear, exciting. It supplied evidence that the god of this universe is involved with humanity.Thorough explanation and display of verbal and chemical connections that cannot be idle coincidences.C Chase"
3,THE GOD CODE BY GREGG BRADEN,"I started to read `The God Code' with a lot of anticipation, but, alas, what a disappointment. Except for a very catchy title the book hasn't much to offer and eventually turns out to be very boring. It is very hard to follow Braden's logic from the DNA model on the one side to world peace on the other, but is it even worse to think about what he tries to prove with his God Code. As I see it, according to his logic, an ape has as much of a chance to claim that he/she is the chosen child of god, as has a human. Possibly I expected to much though!"
4,"The God Code: The Secret of our Past, the Promise of our Future","I'm enjoying it so far, but I have not finished it due to busy schedule. The order came as expected."
5,Excellent Quality and Timely Service! Thank you!!!,The book's quality was BETTER than described! I loved the book and highly recommend it to anyone searching for understanding and enlightenment. Other books by Gregg Braden are equally as good.
1,this book is irrevelant,"The arrogance of assuming that God would choose to speak through only one human language must be seen here. To assume one knows the will or make-up of the Creator is blasphemy. We are all part of the One, that point is irrefutable. That the One would choose to speak to us in such archaic ways is silly. It is we who must grow up and realise that the Voice of God speaks clearly to each soul. We have but to be silent enough inside to hear."
3,"Good console, bad bundle","The Gamecube is a great system, but this bundle is sorely lacking.more than just buying a Gamecube, you get Mario Sunshine and and an itty bitty memory card that holds only 500k (i.e. 1/16th what other system's memory cards hold).If you play any sports games at all, or game more than occasionally, you will be drop-kicking the tiny included girly-man memory card quite soon. Do yourself a favor and pick up the still rather scrawny (but adequate) 2 MB Nintendo memory card instead."
4,A great game with a great system..,Nintendo has always been the name in video games. Super high quality with super high quality products. They are the leaders of the video game industry. The great Nintendo Gamecube is now packaged with a memory card to save data on all games and one of the star titles. This is truly a great game with Miyamato(Head developer) magic and a dose of nintendo quality.
2,"please,already,just make a super mario sunshine 2","i saw this on a demo.it looked great,so i bought it.I liked.8 worlds,8 episodes(except corona mountain).you get to deal with big guy(eg:mecha bowser,gooper blooper).you get bunch of jumps like triple jumps,spin jumps,don't waste your money.(as always like other 5 star reviews,buy this game with the bundle pak).you won't be mad.i've gave it two stars because.they write""too bad"",and his voice when he jumps(ya,ma)."
4,-Nintendo- What does Nintendo mean to you?,"NINTENDO has been around since before I was born!! So when you talk about value, best gaming experience, great games and service your talking about NINTENDO!! The reason I like this value pack is because it has my favorite color, favorite system and favorite game plus, memory card 59!! Mario Sunshine is a pretty good game on a scale from 1-5 I pick 10. It is not like other game systems out there as you can see!! It is compact, durable, stylish and the least expensive system, even with a game and a memory card!! TELL ME HOW HELPFUL THIS WAS FOR YOU!?"
5,from China,"Help!! i really want to buy this NGC bundle,but i'm not surewether I(from mainland,china)could recive it by Fedex or DHL,andhow to pay is deeply confused me.do me a favor,please!!"
4,Excellent advanced book in fuzzy cluster analysis,"Previous reviews are correct, this is not a book for beginners. This is an advanced text for specialists in the area of fuzzy clustering, and as such it is an excellent work. Standard fuzzy c-means, Gustafson-Kessel c-means and Gath-Geva c-means are drawn together in a single modeling framework for near-arbitrary cluster shapes. The cluster validity problem is examined in depth, and experimental results in image analysis are used to illustrate the theoretical material. An excellent monograph."
4,"Good price, good product, good size/","I've been using this product for years, mixing it with a little bit of cooked chicken liver and sprinkled with tuna fish. My 11 year old rescue dog (I got him when he was five) loves my ""special mixture."" Red Dog is playful, feisty, energetic, funny, endearing. I feed him four small meals a day. His weight is down to where it should be now because I control how much he gets each day."
1,DON'T BUY HILL'S PET FOODS!!!!!!,"My cat has gone into RENAL FAILURE, possibly from this food, and Hill's company has hired people to REFUTE CLAIMS. They won't even consider it after MY VETERINARIAN HAS CALLED them. These people hired by the company will RUN YOU IN CIRCLES ""standing by their food"" yet REFUSES TO ANSWER a single question posed to them. They have the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE to date. They even LISTEN IN ON CONVERSATIONS while on hold.I dare you to call them to get a list of TOXINS they test for in the food!They will say they do not have access to the list in their department.Good luck with this brand, I am up to $2500.00 in vet bills. How much do you want to pay? See here for more info from others"
5,Excellent book,This book is well written. It is clear and descibes each subject in a way that doesnt leave you confused. I found it hard to put down the book.
2,Let's talk about gong fu and say nothing at all,I ordered this book to learn about the white crane system and to learn a bit about chi gong. The book has about 200 pages where the same information that can be written in 50 pages is regurgitated and only then do you get some white crane information. The pictures and sequence where hard to understand since several movements are depicted in one still and a few lines are supposed to let me know whet just happened. There is a pit of good information here but the bitter fruit that surrounds it is hard on the digestion.
2,First Time Buy for sticks,"Bigger than I thought they would be. Being that the model depicts the size of 7A I thought they would be smaller, but they are more truly the size of 2B. I will go to the music store from now on so I can see the physical size before I buy."
4,Greg & Steve Live,Great fun and motivational video for children.Helps kids interact as they sing and dance to the wonderful music.
4,Great Book!,"An excellent story of how no matter who you are, how low you've gotten, or how little you have you can always get back up on your feet and be great. This book is great for children and the illustrations are wonderful."
1,Buyer Beware,"This book contains all retreads from previous publications. Each American Girl's Christmas story here was written years ago when each ""Girl"" was introduced. The cover is pretty, but very disappointed with the contents as there is absolutely nothing new here at all--not even an intro. Also, beware that many of the ""new"" American Girl books are ""repackages"" of previous publications."
3,Question,"I have no information about this book but have a question that perhaps others are wondering about, as well: What is included in this treasury? Is it the holiday stories of 6 or 7 American girls, or all of them, and are there any extras or bonuses?"
3,Comfortable shoe,I ordered this shoe because of the Aerosoles brand. The fit and comfort is great. The thing I am a little unhappy with on these shoes is the finish of the dark tan leather. It scuff very easy and spots really easy even after treating with a polish and sealer.
2,Sizing ...Too Small,"I order this shoe in a size 9...it fits and feels like an 8 1/2. I wonder what happened. I also order the Black and Tan, both fit and feel like a 9. What happened???"
1,Not Aerosoles?,"I bought this shoe in black thru Amazon as I purchased the same shoe in brown at the department store and loved them! When I received the shoes, they seemed small, I bought the same size I own. After wearing them twice, I heard a weird clicking noise, the plastic cap on the heel fell off! I wore them to work today and there is plastic lining around the toe which is now jabbing into my foot. I have not had any of these issues with the pair I bought from the department store. I am returning them today. Not worth the money on this, I only got to wear the shoes a few times before they literally fell apart."
4,Order a 1/2 size larger than normal. Otherwise fantastic!,"These are VERY true to size, meaning that your foot unless you're blessed with tiny toes will probably go to the very end of this shoe, or close to it. While it's a clog and that's kind of the point, this may be a little more than some are comfortable with. I think it's because the way the end of the shoe is boxed and narrows that this happens. I noticed some people giving the item a lower review because of it, however this should not deter you if you like the look of this shoe.They are also very comfortable. I spent an entire day shopping, and my feet were no worse for wear than if I had worn my favorite sneakers. It feels and looks like a quality product, the size is the only issue, and that's not enough to merit marking it down more than 1 star."
3,"Good light, but disappointed with the brightness & color","I bought these to replace my stock 27w Halogen bulbs in my 2012 Harley Ultra spot lamps. I only replaced one bulb so I could compare them side by side. Unfortunately it wasn't that much brighter (maybe 10% Brighter) and would have expected more since it was higher wattage. I also noticed they were a bit more on the ""Yellow"" end of the spectrum then the stock bulbs and not as ""white"" as they advertised. I rode this morning in the dark and didn't see much difference so now I'm looking at the Piaa 881. I'm running the LED headlight and wanted something to fill out the dead spots. I'd look elsewhere."
5,Fans of Leroy Anderson must BUY THIS!,"I wanted to submit my review as one who's heard this collection as well as Slatkin's RCA BMG recording and subsequent Naxos volumes of Anderson's complete works. The sound is typical of US Decca in the 50s, mediocre but clear and for the most part in stereo. The pickup orchestra recorded in NY's 30th street studios is outstanding.What stands out in this recording, are Anderson's spritely tempos and the taut, perfectly American jazz inflected performance styles of the musicians. I enjoy Slatkin's recordings from St. Louis on the RCA-BMG and England (BBC Concert Orch.) on the Naxos. The St. Louis Sym. plays with a beautiful polish and glow, but not the kind of snap and crackle you hear from the NY musicians on this Decca release. If you really love Anderson's music as I do, then spring for inexpensive set along with the Naxos recordings for modern digital sound."
3,The Leroy Anderson Collection,"Leroy Anderson was still very popular as I was growing up in the 1950's; this 2-disc set brought back some lovely memories and introduced me to things I either didn't recall or hadn't heard previously. It's hard to review. This is either the essence of banal post-war music or the essence of ""easy listening"" as we've come to know it. I'm no musician, so I'll go with the latter. Anderson's music is uniformly engaging and often creative and surprising; you can hear the blend of classical and jazz, along with inflections of Broadway and cinema. Very accessible, even to one without extensive musical training."
5,Leroy Anderson 2 CDs,HelloThese are 2 great Leroy Anderson CDs--You will recognize many of the songs he wrote ------way back...He is still very popular.......Barbara Cooper
3,Get that sexy body 4sure!!,"It really works & tones parts of your body that are from time to time missed! The workout is fun, and the girls keep you going and going."
2,It's very basic,"Was hoping for a bit more that the basic exercises that are on this video. Only played the DVD twice,"
5,u really feel like your a dallas cowboy cheerleader,i am getting ready for cheerleading for my high school team and this helped me use the muscles that i need to use for cheer and i love there instructor and he actually gives you a different way of looking at exercising. Also it tones up all your muscels and shed the pounds! a great buy!
4,You bulk up a little,"It's a decent toning video, but with daily use I tended to bulk up in the hamstrings to a point that it wasn't very lady-like. But, nice beginner-intermed-advanced progressions."
5,Feel The Burn!!,"I tried this DVD out and OMG, I felt the burn. I just finished the DVD for the first time and my outer thighs and arms are sore. & I only did the low impact version, I would probably be be hurting more if I did both, the low and high impact. I recommend this for anyone, beginners or intermediate. I don't think you would like it if you are a hard core gym buff, but its perfect for beginners. They don't teach you how to do the exercises so I recommend you watch the workout before you start it. I really enjoyed this workout today. So I totally recommend this DVD for mostly beginners & intermediates."
5,awesome dvd!,i bought this dvd to shed some baby weight after a 2yr old an a 9mth old flab is definatly what i have! i used the 7min workout an i felt it immiediataly work! if you want a workout thats going to tone an make you feel better this is the one! i have tried alot of workouts an i dont have time to go to the gym or see a personal trainer! this dvd works! if you use it everyday you will lose weight! i love the ab an arm assault parts of this dvd they are great an def work! if you are a mom who needs a great workout plan when the kids take a nap this is the one! only a few minutes an you can tell it works!
2,Not what I expected at all,"I ordered this expecting fully mixed songs that were long enough for my squad to use for competition, at least 2 minutes, preferably 3 minutes. They were not. And I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the mixes either. Unless you are using these as samples to mix with, don't waste your money."
5,Perfect blend between East and West without being hokey,"I, too, stumbled upon MIDIval Punditz at a Tower listening station and happened to press forward to track #2 by mistake. What I then heard was ""Extasis"", which convinced me to buy the rest of the CD, no matter what else was on it. ""Extastis"" was such a rich track and layered on so many levels that it transcended the typical lounge/Buddha Bar feel. I took a big breath when I came home after I spent the money and put the CD in my stereo to hear the rest of it - and man, I wasn't disappointed in the least.Excellent work - from them giving a new spin on traditional bhangra (""Bhangra Fever"") to combining incredible vocals & traditional instruments with studio wizardry (ie. ""Ajmer"") - there is not one weak track on the entire album. For their debut CD these guys have done an amazing job and are a big plus to the ""Asian Massive"" movement. I'm definitely looking forward to their next release."
5,Quite pleased,"My 13 old year grandson is a very fussy dresser and typically wears only jeans. The Diadora pants are the only exception. He likes them because they are comfortable and hide his skinny legs. I like them because they wear remarkably well, hide dirt, and don't wrinkle, fade, or shrink.This Amazon purchase was convenient, economical and a good buy!"
3,Red Sox Hat,"I ordered this hat and received one slightly different than the one in the picture. The one I got had a clasp back, not a velcro seal. The white trim on the brim and the white vent holes were all actually blue like the rest of the hat. These two features, the trim and the velcro, were big selling points that I wish were on the actual hat. Other than that it is as described. Nothing wrong with it, just not as special as the picture. This is not a structured hat, so if you are looking for one, do not purchase this item."
3,Disappointed,"I am disappointed with this book (cat version). The objects in the water filled fish tank page do not float or move within as one would expect and the cat sound is almost impossible to activate (even for an adult). The book is cute and my infant enjoys it, but I would expect a better product for what is advertised and the price paid."
4,"Beyond ""Pat the Bunny""","Clearly not a story book, Ozlo (like Coco) is a ""multisensory activity book"". The pages feature bright colors, different textures, a reflective surface, and even a doggy sound. This is a cheerful and imaginative update of the old ""Pat the Bunny"", first published in 1940, and a bit too fragile for tiny tots.While i love reading books, my daughter and i also enjoy books with no words. I have fun making stories to go with pictures. Since she began talking, i can ask her what she sees, which encourages speaking and vocabulary. And now she can tell her own stories, using the visuals as a spark for her imagination."
2,"Umm, not worth all the hoopla","The book started out with a bang....then fizzled out. We never really saw what the relationship was between her and Redmond. It would have been interesting to see what she truly had to endure in that marriage. And as for Damon, we never really got to miss him because he was gone in chapter 1 and back again in chapter 2. It would have been nice to have the reader feel the loss of him in her life.Anyway, I'm glad I didn't spend the money on the book and borrowed it from a friend. It was easy to put down and hard to pick back up again. But it looks like I'm in the minority on this list of reviewers."
5,Excellent Product,"I've been using this product for 7+ years. It works fantastic on mats. I never brush my dogs dry, this will break the hair and damage the coat. I spray this on a little at a time on the area I'm working on. Their coat stays nice and shiny. I've used it for dog shows and now I use it for brushing all the time."
5,a great point of contact with Zizek,"Watch the movie for a new understanding when reading Zizek's books. In short, Zizek's writings are more accessible to me for having experienced the human Zizek in this movie. Though he says in the film ""I am not human; I am a monster,"" the human Zizek is still apparent. For me that is important. In ""Good Will Hunting"", the Matt Damon character claims that one does not need Harvard when a Boston Public Library Card is enough. I find this false--we must be engaged by more than paper and ink. To encounter the author in bodily form, as we do in this film (with Zizek in the role of pedagogue), touches the learner more profoundly. Having voice, emotion, facial expressions at my disposal when I read Zizek greatly enhances the reading."
3,What Happened?,"I gave this a 3 star rating because of the end - more on that later.The characters in Silver's book are interesting and torn - a great combination. She makes them believable and you can jump right in and follow them through their journey.The plot was straight forward and moved in a logical direction. Beginning to middle Beneath A Mountain Moon was a fun and enjoyable book to read.My two issues with this book were -Over detailing of the magical scenes: this is a matter of taste, so if you enjoy reading through magical rituals, the herbs and other tools in great detail you'll like her style in this. I personally didn't.The end left you wondering what happened: After following her main character through the book the reader is left with a very vague end. The only thing that is certain is that you know she's not dead. Other than that...Where is she? What happened? Is she in the real world or in the shadows or...? It was very disappointing to be left hanging like this."
4,"Keep writing, Silver","It's wonderful that someone is finally writing realistic occult fiction. Good plotting, and the use of witchcraft is great, but the characters didn't quite breathe for me. However, it's definitely worth a read. I found it to be inspirational and I'm looking forward to more fiction from Silver"
1,The Moon,"ME THINKS THOU HAST BEEN STARING AT AND SITTING ""BENEATH A MOUNTAIN MOON"" JUST A BIT TOO LONG."
5,Truly essential.,"""Music and Wine,"" and ""Pure"" are two of my favorite tracks from Naked Music NYC. If you haven't been introduced to Naked Music, allow this album to introduce you. If you've already got some of their stuff, you'll probably want to pick this one up anyway. It is excellent, soulful house music."
3,"Good collection, if a little redundant","Enough of the songs on this CD appear on the ""... Dimensions Vol. 1"" compilation (with more tracks to boot) that you should actually bypass this CD for the other on dollar value alone, despite the fact that it has some of the freshest house music that's been released in a long time. If, however, you are one of those people who simply must collect everything, get it for the remixes of the stuff that stood out on the ""Nude Dimensions 1"" disc. There's enough to make it, not a bad purchase, but an unnecessary one in light of it's superior."
3,Good Vibes,This is a good collections of smooth vibes. The first track pulls you in but the other tracks range from good to ok next track. Still a good addition to my collection. Vol. 2 makes up for what this lacks.
5,Worth the money,"Import records are expensive but this one is worth the extra $'s. It'll expand your mind with great pop music. A Song For The Lonely is a chilling ballad about, you guessed it, lonliness and the song Ramshackle Beauty which didn't appear on the album with the same name, is one of his best ever songs. One day everyone will know who Daniel Wylie is. For now, I'm pleased I got in there and found him. Go find him for yourself."
3,Not bad,"This a pretty good bio of Alanis but it is pretty boring. It mostly talks about Klovan, Morgan and her family, not much about her. So it's not bad, but if you're an Alanis fan, don't buy it."
5,Read this and remember it,"All I have to say about this book is this: if you want an interesting, informative book about the life of Alanis Morissette, one that is accurate and obviously researched, then you have to find a book written by Paul Cantin. He is the only person truly qualified to be Alanis Morissette's biographer, and he has proven it. I mean this. Do not buy a biography of Alanis Morissette that wasn't written by Paul Cantin. At the very least, if Cantin didn't write the book, he has to approve of it."
4,Best Alanis bio!,"... I've read a few Alanis Morissette biographies but this one takes the cake! Paul Cantin gives us an indepth look into Alanis's life in a professional and wonderfully written way, unlike that so-called bio ""Ironic: The Story of Alanis Morissette"". If you're interested in an Alanis bio, get this one!"
3,Somewhat confused,"This book contains many beautiful sweaters. I picked one that really appealed to me and have been struggling ever since to make sense of the instructions. There are instructions that are hard to follow, as well as typos and errors. I recommend this book to experienced knitters who are able to figure things out for themselves."
2,A bit quirky,"It starts out promising, but Mr. Edelstein soon lost me when he suggests that we trespass upon someone else's property, find an empty room and crawl around in it. The point is not lost (regarding his discussion on observation), but the ""assignment"" is a bit strange. I would prefer to do things that will not get me arrested or committed. The advice throughout, however, will probably be effective or helpful for some, but not for me personally."
2,"Too much fluff, not enough code","This book continues the tradition of large margins, lots of screenprints that don't reflect what the IDE actually does, and not giving the information you need where you need it. For example, on page 722 under the heading ""Distributing Applications,"" McClanahan writes, ""An important fact that you may not be aware of is that you must distribute a set of PowerBuilder DLLs with your EXE files."" He then proceeds NOT to tell you what those files are, leaving you to your own devices. Gee, thanks David."
2,"A good reference, perhaps, but a poor introduction.","I am still looking for a good introduction to Power Builder, but this isn't it. Perhaps for someone with extensive experience in another very similar visual tool, this would do as an only reference. However, it is of little use to someone attempting to learn the environment and the PowerBuilder methodology. For example, I have worked my way through almost 500 hundred pages and still have not seen how to connect a data window object to a data window control or how to bind and script the control with a program. Since these (amongst other missing) concepts are key to fishin' with PowerBuilder, the reader is left cuttin' bait."
2,Less than adequate introduction,"McClanahan's book provides a less than adequate introduction to the features of PowerBuilder 5; much of the book reads like a copy of the PowerBuilder Help files. Also, the number of typographical errors is extremely high - sentences are left incomplete, references to figures are incorrect, controls are referenced by incorrect names, etc.You would think that someone also responsible for teaching PowerBuilder classes would take the time to ensure that the material which he presented in his book lived up to the highest standards!"
3,So close...,"This could be a really terrific book, but falls short due to the stereotypes that are promoted. I have been looking for a book about Hanukah to read to my daughter's class, where she is the only child of Jewish parents, and I so wanted this to be it. It can't be the one, though, because of the Baker selling ""Challah, two for a dollar"" line, and the pictures that, although beautifully rendered, depict Jews as from the shtetl. To the author's credit, the police officer in the book is a woman. The story is playful, and if it weren't for what I mentioned above, I'd be reading it to the class."
2,Chanukah IS NOT the Jewish Christmas,"With such wonderful illustrations, and a mostly enjoyable text, it's too bad that this book gets its inspiration from ""Twas The Night Before Christmas"". Jewish parents work hard teaching their children that Chanukah IS NOT the Jewish Christmas. This book doesn't help. There are much better choices out there."
3,"Needs fewer hikes, more details","I like the book, but I think in an attempt to get all 100 hikes in one book that too many details were left out. It doesn't look easy to find the trails for a new comer to NM and a little more detail on how to reach the trail heads would be appreciated."
3,More for the hiker who likes longer hikes,"While the location of the hikes are in some interesting and beautiful sites, often the hikes are in difficult situations and over longer distances. If you are a part=time hiker and like to hike shorter distances, less than 4 or 5 miles I would suggest you look elsewhere. If you want challenges over longer distances and challenging situations this is probably for you."
3,Great Reference,Good book to keep in your car for those impromtu hiking opportunities. Good maps and directions to trail heads. Descriptions are pretty accurate.
2,Subpar,"I guess I was expecting a bit more from this guide. It give very little information on the actual hike and what you might see. What photos it does have are terrible B&W; grainy images.The book is quite outdated and makes no mention of certain areas that are now quite popular for hikes. For the low cost however, I guess you can not go wrong buying it if only to get directions to the sites and parking info."
3,A word of caution,"If you are looking for something new, don't be disappointed when you discover that most of the material in this 2004 book is reproduced from articles written by Pavel Tsatsouline for the US magazine ""Muscle Media"", part of Bill Phillips' nutrition supplement business, over the preceding four years."
4,Least favorite--but still excellent,"Personally, I would have liked to have seen more integration in this product with Dragon Door's other training systems (kettlebells and calisthenics--or even PTP). As it is, workouts tend toward more powerlifting-style barbell training with the odd calisthenic exercise thrown in. It's certainly NEW information--it doesn't have much crossover with their other products at all--and I'm sure the workouts are top-notch. I simply don't see being able to successfully work this product in other products that I prefer, so it is less useful for me. If you ARE looking for strength and mass training system, I recommend starting withBuild Muscle Lose Fat Look Great: Everything You Need to Know to Transform Your Body--this would make excellent additional material for someone who has been on those programs for some time."
3,Great value,"Seeing that I only paid about $1 for the item, I can't really complain. Although, its made of a pretty cheap silicon, and doesn't fit the phone very well. However, it gets the job done and I recieved exactly what I expected when I ordered it, a $1 case."
2,Case Cover doesn't fit properly,"This case is wonderful in the fact that it molds nicely to the phone. HOWEVER, and this is why it only gets two stars, it doesn't close all the way because of the silicon pieces INSIDE. Thanks and have a nice day."
4,Good quality good price,"Purchased this for my 8 year old, was a little long but fit good otherwise and has worn it several times with no issues"
4,Daughter Loves It,My daughter loves this costume. She tries to wear it daily. It is a great buy. We will use it for dress up after Halloween. I would recommend this purchase.
4,Rock of Anzio,Just what I was looking for and it arrived promptly and in good condition. It was everything that it promised it would be. My boyfriend loved it!
4,An outstanding book telling the stories of the men of 45th,"This fine book tells the story of the 45th infantry division in World War II. It does not glorify the war but simply tells the tale. It is well researched with both in-person interviews and historical records.The book retells the great suffering of the men while in Italy, and near-disasters of the landings at Salerno and Anzio.Highly recommended for those interested in WWII history and in the life of the infantry soldier. This book concentrates on the Thunderbirds of the 45th Infantry Division. For a broader look at much of the same subject matter, I recommend War in the Mediterranean by Carlo D'Este."
5,Excellent look at a National Guard unit in WWII,"Being a former National Guard officer and having visited the concentration camp in Dachau in a trip through Europe, I was interested in this book. The scene when the soldiers get to the Dachau concentration camp was unforgettable. This event makes us all realize how important it was to win this war against fascist and extremely racist dictators.Whitlock does an excellent job in trying to report the facts without any moral judgements in all parts of the book. Whitlock also brings the reader to see the mistakes as well as the successes and gives his reasons. We see the events of Anzio from the level of generals, and other events from the reactions of lower level officers and enlistedmen. This book is a true testament to the sacrifice of Guard soldiers in World War II. I wish there were more books like this one on Guard units in World War II. This is an excellent book to read for the amateur military historian."
2,need more info,"although i can't disagree with anything she wrote, I found this book far to brief. Not very helpful."
2,Didn't work for my dogs.,Both my dogs had a bad case of goopy eyes and I gave this product a shot. The entire system takes a while to complete and it's not easy it remember what step to do next. I saw some improvement while doing the system but it was not a cure. Next time I think I'll save the time and effort and just keep flushing thier eyes with warm distilled water.
1,Adult size mouth ordered,I ordered the adult sized mouth piece which I had received. But when I attempted to place it in my mouth it was way to small. It would fit a young child better.Im very unhappy with this purchase although i have not gotten back to the vendor. Its not worth my time or energy.
2,Didn't work,I was gonna use it as a night time bite guard. There is just too much material there however.
4,ShockDoc,"Great product. Took a little extra to mold it, but worked well. Kept the $4k smile safe during the games."
2,Alright... I Guess,received product fast. kind of a small mouth guard. didnt fit well. but it was alright. and it was more of a purple not pink.
2,Made me cut my lip,"I used this mouth piece for boxing and I was not very happy with it. Every time I would get hit, the top edge of the mouth piece would cut open my upper lip on the inside. I had to actually cut some of the plastic off to make it work. On top of that I had trouble molding the thing to my mouth. I was not impressed with the quality of it for the amount I paid for it. I would look elsewhere next time."
2,Wouldn't waste the $$$,"Cons:When I received the mouthpiece it was too small, even though the package said adult, so I couldn't wear it. It didn't even cover my back molars.Feels bulky when I tried to shape the mouthpiece.Pros:Well, since I couldn't use it...I can't provide any pros."
2,Can't breath!,"It fits and protects well, if you follow the fitting instructions, but it has no air holes gaps in the bite area, so it's hard to breath while clenching down on it. It's great if you want this mouthguard to watch TV."
2,Not a good choice if you dont wear a helmet,"I practice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and need a mouthguard that is low profile and doesn't make my lips stick out, unlike this one. This guard has so much material between your front teeth and lips it makes your top lip stick out like a fish. If you get hit in mouth wearing this guard you are more than likely going to split your upper lip.I wore it once and got the ""Shock Doctor Pro"" mouthguard instead. I think this guard would be fine if you are wearing a helmet to protect your face, otherwise, get a smaller profile guard."
4,good,"I bought this for my 7 year old son for lacrosse. It was a bit bulky in his mouth (the reason for the 4 stars), but it did the job...until he wore it for his first game. He walked off the field with the thing chewed to bits. because of the double layers there were pieces actually coming off that he could have choked on. so i went and bought a new mouth guard, but this time a regular shock doctor that i'm hoping will last longer. had he not chewed on it, there would have not been a reason to get a new one, but, boys will be boys."
3,Big mouth; HUGE mouthguard,"So I already have a pretty big mouth. I had to bend the mouthguard before I molded it to my teeth to fit my jaw shape but front gel was so thick that it fit rather uncomfortably in my mouth. I was unable to shut my mouth all the way which forced me to sleep with my mouth open and I never woke up with it in my mouth, so I couldn't tell if it even did the job. I read the directions for molding it about 10 times before I did it and I even tried RE-molding it to see if I did it wrong, and it didn't take as well the second time because when I boiled it again, the gel didn't go back to its original shape, so it oozed through the side holes instead of going up to form to my gums. Not too impressed."
4,Not the most comfortable but seems very effective,"I'm used to wearing mouthguards but this is bulkier than others I have used in the past. Although it takes a bit of getting used to, I like knowing that it's thicker and as a result, I'm assuming it's more protective.PROS- Effective for protecting teeth/mouth as well as mitigating head injuries- Looks like a serious mouthguardCONS- Very thick and may be uncomfortable to some- My 5yo has a child version that he chewed up after first useOVERALLIf you can get past the thickness, this mouthguard works like a charm."
1,Cuts your lip,The hard plastic separates from the gel and leaves a sharp edge that cuts the inside of your upper lip. There is an Everlast version of the same. Definitely NOT for fighting. Terrible mouthpiece.
1,"Poor product design, can cause injury to mouth","I don't typically write reviews, but this is one of the worst products I've used. The sad thing is that you won't know how bad it is until you put them on, but then you can't get a refund because you've already worn it. Hence, I resort to writing this negative review.The plastic outer wall of the mouth guard presses against the gums and inner lip when mouth is closed (and it kind of makes the mouth protrude). When lightly pressing on my mouth I can feel the plastic wall digging into my inner lip... I can't imagine what would happen if someone were to bump/contact my mouth during contact sports! To keep it short, stay away from buying this poorly-designed product."
1,Horrible. Will make your mouth bleed.,"If you look at the picture, you will notice that the mouthguard is comprised of two colors. Basically, the mouthguard is made up of two parts: the black part which is the frame and the grey part which is the ""gel"".I have owned several mouth guards and am quite familiar with the fitting process in general. After boiling and fitting (as per instructions), the greyish part slightly separated from the frame which created noticeable fissures on the outside of the mouth guard. After sparring with this for 2 minutes, I removed it as the fissures felt uncomfortable and scratched the inside of my mouth up. If I took a hard shot, it definitely would have caused a big cut.Don't buy this."
2,Adult Size?,"Though the description stated ""Adult"" it turned out too small for my mouth. Unlike shoe sizes not many will know how big (or wide) their mouth is. Perhaps we could bite down on a styrofoam cup and send it to the manufacturer."
1,Hard to fit,"Got one for myself and one for my wife. Followed the fitting instructions precisely. After two tries, she got hers so that it will work. After a few tries with mine, the gel separated from the rubber and it created very uncomfortable rough spots. Threw it away and ordered a Nano. We'll see how that goes. I can't recommend this one."
3,It's ok for a boil n bite!,"I've used worse. Feels kind of big in my mouth compared to others, but it conformed well to my teeth and it doesn't have that nasty taste the cheaper ones have. I did have to heat it up again to get the perfect fit. Some folks are saying they couldn't get it to fit right. I don't think they did it right. Follow the directions to a "" T "" & you shouldn't go wrong. Then again, it's a boil n bite. One can't be too picky about it. If you want perfection, see your dentist and have one made for you."
3,Bulky,"I had originally bought this to protect my teeth in brazilian jiu-jitsu rolling sessions. While I have no doubt it will protect the top row of my teeth well, I found it to be a large and bulky - jutting out around my teeth and making it difficult to curl my front lip over it. I suppose it can't be helped, as it does require a larger guard in order to surround the teeth with protective gel. But now that I have picked up Taekwondo, I've gotten a thinner, plastic guard for sparring sessions. Comfort, more than protection, has been the issue here, as I don't like to spar with my mouth open.A word of warning - due to the nature of the gel, the guard can only be molded once. Unlike other guards, your teeth really sink deep into the gel when you mold it, so make sure you get it right the first time. If you attempt to mold it a second time, the spaces in the gel that your teeth made the first time around aren't going to fill themselves in."
2,Way too big for a woman!,"My mouth is completely torn up from wearing this just 2 times during roller derby practice. . I admit, I am a small 5 1"" woman, but this guard is way too big. I regret making my 12 year old wear one of these for football."
2,I ordered Youth size and got an adult size,"So I thought I ordered Shock Doctor Youth Gel but I am just so baffled at why I ended up with exactly what I was trying not to order - the adult gel max. Ugh, I even spent time scouring around in amazon until I find Youth size. This really sucks. It is just sitting around now, still in the box. This is SO inconvenient."
1,i hate it,Do not waste ur money. Didn't work. Doesn't stay on fall off when u open ur mouth. I don't know what else to say
2,Too loose,"I bought one of these for sparring (I do kempo karate). I must have fit it at least six times. It fit to my teeth perfectly, but was too loose in my mouth; it fell out every time I opened my mouth, obstructed my breathing, and made me gag quite a few times (probably because it was too big for my mouth). I guess it's just not the mouthguard for me."
3,get what u pay for,ok this came very very fast like 2 days and i got the 3-5 day shipping but not a great mouthgaurd kinda hard to fit in mouth and no matter how much you try to mold it it will make you lips pop out
1,Didnt Hold up well to daily use,"My husband got this for just practice, it took forever to get a good fit and it didnt hold up well"
2,More like a ball gag,"I followed the directions on the packet to the tee and never got a correct fit. I tried so many times to get it right that it just ended up looking like an amorphous blob. I purchases a $2 at my local whalemart and it fit a thousand times better and it only took one try. This one is uncomfortable, bulky and hard to mold. I don't recommend it at all!"
1,Shock Doctor mouthguard,"I bought this from Dicks Sporting Goods, not impressed at all. It cost $15, I had never had a shock doctor mouth guard, usually I use the cheaper ones like are distributed for high school sports. Anyways, it was too narrow for my mouth I had to stretch the sides alot for it to fit width wise. After boiling and biting down to custom fit for my mouth.. the ends of it (the little hexagon shaped bumps) under my molars are very uncomfortable. I cant even close/ bite down with it in because it causes to much discomfort.I'll try it out for one night of training, bjj/ boxing, but I did just order a Bad Boy mouth guard for $7 off of amazon which I will most likely switch over to."
5,Great quality,"I got this mouth guard in Maroon. The picture is true to color, which is something that I was mildly worried about. Fitting this piece was really simple, I only had to try it once. In the past I've had to do it multiple times before it actually felt right. When the time comes for a new mouth guard (From what I can tell by the quality, that is going to be a long time from now), I'm definitely going to order this one again. I highly recommend this one as your choice."
2,"Great gel, uncomfortable frame","I'm not an athlete. I've never worn a mouth guard before. I'm currently taking kenpo and needed a mouthguard. This one looked fancy and the gel sounded comfortable. I followed all of the instructions and easily got the guard fit for my mouth. When it was all cooled down I tried it on again. The gel conformed perfectly to my mouth, giving a snug fit that felt good. The problem was that the hard plastic outer portion that holds the gel was very uncomfortable to my upper lip in front. I could tell that if I got hit straight on in the mouth my lip would get very bloody very easily. I bought a different guard at a local big box store for less than two dollars just to see if it was my problem or the shock doctor's. The inexpensive mouth guard feels suitably protective, and the front and sides are infinitely more comfortable. I would recommend against this mouth guard."
1,Good moutpiece - if you don't need a double sided one,"This mouthpiece is comfortable, and works as advertised in that you can breath/talk while wearing it - BUT... The reason for that though is that it only protects the top row of teeth, not the bottom. I thought that might be the case when I ordered it, but couldn't really tell from the pictures or description. so I am putting it in the review so others might not make the same $10 mistake. For martial arts, a double mouth guard is a must so this one is basically useless in my opinion. I will keep it as an emergency backup but hope I never have to use it."
5,Perfect,"The mouthguard fit perfectly. The gel molded fine. All I had to do was stick it in water, pop in the microwave for a minute or so, and the gel metled just enough to mold, and not scald my mouth."
4,Good Product,Ordered this device for my daughter who spars quite often in Tae kwon do. She is very happy with the mouthpiece.
2,So so product,This requires a bit of attention to mold to your mouth. This is not the product for me. It is a bit bulky and I cannot close my mouth completely.
1,"cheap, uncomfortable, not well moldable","Just got this and tried it, following the instructions exactly. Took a couple of tries to get it to the point where it's barely wearable. It's way too balky and terribly uncomfortable. oh and forget about trying to breathe while you have it in your mouth...especially when you're doing cardio and need more oxygen.my advice is to stay away from this one...even though it's little cheaper than some of the others. saving a couple of dollars was definitely not worth it. at least for me."
5,Good fit,My daughter uses this for protection in martial arts and she says it is more comfortable than the cheaper $2 mouthpieces. Seems to be made of quality stuff and would buy again.
3,okay,"This product is okay, I use it when I am training in my martial arts class. It doesn't have a lot of padding for the bottom teeth, but I have been hit in the face a few times, and my teeth are still intact and my lips were not shredded."
2,Just not the same,This little mouth piece seems very very nice until I boiled and fit it. It is a very stiff mouth piece and I cannot get the comfort match of the Brain Pad from this piece. I have seen many many people wearing this mouth guard in grappling tournaments so I figured I would give it a shot. Either it just isn't for me or all these other people have not tried out the Brain Pad by Everlast.
1,Worked Great!...Until It Didn't,"Purchased this Sony Slave Flash as an accessory to my Sony digital camera. Right before the warranty expired it quit working. Assuming it needed a new battery, I replaced it, only to have it quit again after a few light ups. By the time I realized the Slave Flash (and not the batteries) was at fault, the warranty had expired. I contacted Sony, explained that I had given their Slave Flash the benefit of the doubt by replacing batteries instead of contacting them, but they wouldn't help me a bit - no replacement and no repairs. In fact, they said it couldn't be repaired at all. I was advised to purchase a replacement Slave Flash. No thanks."
2,Better as a hockey puck...great flash (if you're prepared for the footnotes),"So, I'd read a few reviews and finally caved in and bought the flash. My Sony Cybershot DSC-P73 was on the list of compatible cameras and the price seemed reasonable.But what I got for my money was disappointing. Okay...virtually useless.Tucked away in the notes for the Flash (and nowhere on eBay ro the Sony site that I could see) is a ""note"" that, hey, this won't work outdoors and it won't work indoors either unless you're pointing it at a shiny surface.Now I ask you: who wants to be pointing their uber-flash at a ""shiny"" surface while taking a picture?! Think you'll be seeing great results?Not likely. Not from this ""flash"" anyway. If you can even get it to fire. Preliminary tests have proven the ""note"" to be true. It don't work. I did however get it to fire when I took the flash off and physically pointed the camera at the flash when taking the picture...so nice."
3,Good after a little work,I purchased this item for my DSC-W170 - it's nicely made. Initially it did not work properly - almost always fired with the pre-flashes due to a supersensitive sensor. Never failed to fire even with my finger over the sensor! I fixed it by cutting out small circles of masking tape (using three hole punch). Two of these stuck over the sensor and it works beautifully.
3,Great Size and Price; Eats Ink!,"Yes, the printer's got a great size, great style, and a great price--even for the ink. But this is probably because it eats through the ink so quickly! I've had mine for about two months, and I just started my third cartridge. Even given that the first cartridge might be a low-ink starter cartridge, that's pretty fast! And I don't think I print overly much, though I am in school, but I don't think I've printed much more than 100 pages in that span--and all at Fast Draft, Grayscale."
1,This printer never even turned on. It sucked.,Do not buy. It was bad. I was so happy to buy a printer for my parents and hook it up but it would not even turn on. I ended up ordering a completely different printer. I don't know if it was damaged due to shipping or what but I was very disappointed.
2,Not a bad printer for light printing,"This isn't a bad printer if you don't print a lot. Had trouble with some pictures. But for the money, this works good."
2,Disappointed,Purchased as a back-up printer for a 3rd computer... very disappointed in machine function; doubt it will survive too many years of service. Ink cartidges seem on the small side. Have used HP printers for the past 18 - 20 years... maybe time to change or to spend a few more bucks for a higher end product.
3,Not up to par.,"I've enjoyed many of Karen Kijewski's previous novels, and I think Kat Colorado is a solid character, much more interesting than V. I. Warshawski or Kay Scarpetta. (Nobody comes close to Kinsey Millhone, of course.) But this volume in the series seemed to fall flat for me. Several times I found my attention wandering; the plot didn't keep me interested and I found myself bored.One flaw with this book is that there are too many victims and not enough suspects. I guessed who the criminal was about halfway through the novel. It wasn't that hard to figure out, because by process of elimination, everybody else was either a target or too obvious to be the culprit.I find it interesting that the other reviewers of this book either loved it or hated it. The truth probably lies somewhere in between. Kijewski's characters are strong enough to survive a weak plot; one can only hope that this book is an exception to an otherwise fine series."
3,Realistic sounding detective work.......,"KAT SCRATCH FEVER has a plot that is interesting and intricate, but there are so many characters who have very little to make them memorable that I got confused several times and had to go back and look them up to refresh my memory as to just who they were. That's a boring job - thumbing through many, many pages already read trying to find a certain name. I swear I wanted to like this book. I did like Kat, but the book, itself, lacked something for me."
5,Very well done,"I bought this book because the reviews about Rough Guide were pretty bad, and I must say Lonely Planet delivered once again. It's full of ""local"" tips that must have taken the author a very long time to put together.A few more mini-maps would save dozens of lines of directions to reach those hidden places, and would save the reader a lot of time on the road.We would also have done with a few more places to stay and eat, but locals are so welcoming that it was a joy to ask them.These shortcoming anyway don't even erode one star, as the guide is otherwise exceptional. We didn't need anything else."
4,The same quality as most lonely planet guides,"It is very good for planing the trip, but non to follow word by word as places which get signed in the guide tend to rise prices(so you should chose hotels by browsing in the internet)"
5,A Review by my 7 year old Daughter,"Dear Kids, This computer is the BEST! A few of my friends also have one and we all love it so much. Some of the games are a little easier and some are a little harder, so that makes it good for me.Now from the Mom: My daughter works on math games even though they are hard for her in school. This computer not only expands the range of her thinking skills and supports flexibility and adabtability, but makes it fun for her to work on skills she is less comfortable with. This is a very nice product."
3,Great for kids,my god-daughter loves her barbie laptop........all she needs is an adaptor since the batteries runs down very quickly. Anyone purchase an adaptor or know if ther's one available. Other than that great educational toy for a child.
3,Christmas Gift for 5 Year Old,"I purchased this for my neice this past Christmas. She was happy with it and wanted to use the laptop immediately. She played with it for a while, and then chose to do other things. It didn't keep her interest. I'm hoping she will reconsider and begin playing with it soon!"
5,Amazon Jo Staff Review,My coworker encouraged me to buy a Jo Staff so that we could use them on break at work. We have been doing that for a few days. The weight and balance are good and the price was right.
4,Bring Back the Good Old (and Innocent) Days,Very warming to hear these songs. Some are somewhat obscure and dated. Would recommend the album to anyone. Great to sing along.
5,Inspiring story about love for a pony and courage,"The is a very readable book for young adults and adults. The story is centered around a boy's love and empathy for a pony, and his loss of the pony due to circumstances he cannot control. In addition, this tale set in historic Britain, is one where honesty and courage prevail. The plot is very exciting, the details are believeable (will not turn horse-people ""off"".) I look forward to using the book in a summer school 8th grade enrichment class I teach. It has all the elements to keep readers interested!"
2,More trekking required,"For the trekking in the US, this book does not mention anything east of Arizona. A book like this should be written by someone that has traveled more. Or it should concentrate on specific areas of the world, with multiple contributors.Printed in Singapore."
2,Not sure about this...,"i loved this scent when it first came out. I was obsessed. When I ordered this, i wasnt expecting the exact same scent becasue I know this scent was discontinued a very long time ago. So, I wasnt surprised to find that it was very strong. Stronger than the original version. I actually have to put some water in it. I was wiling to try it for the price, but no it is not the same. :("
3,"Okay, but...","This was a gift. It is as described, and EXACTLY what you see in the picture. No label, no box, no logo, just a plain bottle. Great smell, but it looks like something you'd get at the dollar store. I had to explain to my wife what it was. You'd think Liz Claiborne would want to acknowledge their own product."
2,size,"The size was very small, even too small for a stocking stuffer. It came ina large box with bubble wrap and the product was not even in a box and you couldnot tell what it was without a magnifing glass."
2,Paying for the same material twice,"While the material in this book is useful, I resent having to purchase at todays prices a book that duplicates so much material already included in the book that comes with the original software. The least Adobe could have done is use different examples and include more detail on some of the concepts. Many users of Premiere also get their edition packaged with an editing card and additional plug-in software to enhance Premiere. There is very little help for this."
4,Excellent,"One of the best instructional books I've ever read! Perfect for beginners! The lessons are short and too the point. Explains with easy to follow directions. I spent two straight days reading this book cover to cover. Lessons range from simple editing, to more complex layering and bluescreen techniques. My only gripe is I wish it was longer! Don't get me wrong the book covers everything you could hope to get out of Premiere. I'm looking forward to a volume 2."
3,Boring unless you're a scholar of satire/18th-c. lit.,"It is, in my opinion, probably more noteworthy for its portrayal of the human spirit and for its satire of virtually everything associated with the 18th century than it is for overall literary value. Fielding was suffering from, sadly, fatal, health problems when he wrote this, but that serves to free him from any traditional parameters of restraint. He glances at nearly every conceivable arena of 18th-century life, and his satire is uncanny. It is, however, a tedious read unless: 1-you truly enjoy Fielding; 2-you are interested in 18th-century English literature; 3-you are interested in the literary genre of travel books; or, 4-you are interested in masterful satire. Additionally, if you are a student and you have been required to read this, you will unfortunately find few resources available to help you in your understanding of this book."
1,Surprised,Probably a good product. Surprized that product will not interface with a Nokia 5200 series phone as advertized!
5,A great reference book on constraint processing,"I've found this book to be invaluable for my research so far. My area of research isn't in constraint processing itself, but some of the problems I've worked on have had hard constraints needing to be addressed, and this book has made it easy to do so.This book is very well written, clearly explaining the various topics. I've had no problems understanding any of the material presented. It does a great job of covering the various techniques for dealing with constraints. It gives many examples and provides detailed pseudocode for the various algorithms, making them easy to implement.I would highly recommend this book to anyone needing a book on constraint processing."
5,The Bronx,This is a must have if you love the Bronx as much as I do. The CD is in perfect condtion and arrived in a timely manner.Thanx.
4,A pleasure to read,"A friend recommended this series, the characters are fun and realistic and the stories are interesting. They carry on from one book to the next, as soon as I finish one I look forward to the next one. Pure escapism with people you care about."
5,J. A. Jance is a unique mystery writer.,Dead To Rights is an excellent example of the work of J. A. Jance. She is well acquainted with the geography and history of the areas in which she sets the stories. I try to read all of her books as I am a very long time resident of Arizona and also have some knowledge of the state of Washington.Once I start a book by Ms. Jance I have a very difficult time putting the book down.
4,4th Sheriff Brady mystery still good,"I enjoyed the personal development of Joanna's story in this 4th installment. My only complaints would be I wanted to get to know Hal Morgan better, and the motivations for the murder at the end were a bit sketchy. I won't do a spoiler, but I wasn't able to figure out why they did what they did and to whom."
4,One of the best in the series...but...,"I enjoyed every aspect of this book but the ""budding"" romance for Joanna. Many a good mystery heroine has been ruined by adding sappy romantic aspects to the book. I hope that doesn't happen to Joanna."
4,All of the Joanna Brady Books.,"I live in the AZ. area, where all of these (J.B) books are written about, and I can picture all of the terrain that she writes about. She discribes the country to a tee. I live about 10 miles from where the ""Joanna Brady"" home is, on the High Lonesome Rd.I bought """"ALL"""" of the Brady series books and like a fool I loaned the first 2 out and never got them back. Now I would like to replace them. I can never actually replace them because she signed them and so did her Mother and Dad. Maybe someday I can get some more and have HER sign them again.Nancy"
2,Jance Can't Seem to Tie This One Together,"The theme of the plot & story are very good, but after reading Rattlesnake Crossing, this was a disappointment. Maybe Jance is trying to develop her characters & their relationships here. But there is so much superfluous dialogue it becomes boring. A couple pages later you get lucky & she returns you to the story. A previous reviewer stated his least favorite chapter was #20. I agree. Unfortunately Chapter 20 is where the book's climax takes place. More superfluous nonsense in the middle of the story with the introduction, ever so briefly, of another character & a dog. Unneeded fluff. The book falls flat on it's face in it's ability to tie the story together well at the end. Possibly Jance was so distracted by other dialogue. Save your time & money unless you need a sleeping pill. Dead to Rights will put you out in short time"
4,A great audiobook and plot,"JA Jance keeps you on your toes with this novel, a great murder mystery set in AZ featuring heroine joanna Brady, the newly elected sheriff in Cochise county. When she enlists in police officer's school for newly hired officers, she is once again involved in a homicide, with an unlikely suspect. in following leads that lead her deeper into this murder, she is herself in danger. She meets a gentleman she first distrusts, and then finds to be a strong, supportive friend, her future husband Butch Dixon.This audio book is well narrated, if you can grab a used version, do so, its worth it. They are hard to find.If you listen to audiobooks, this is an easy book to follow, it won't let you fall asleep, and you'll be tempted to listen to it from the first to last tape."
1,Hmmm.....,"I found this book to be an utter and confusing mess. I didn't give a flip about any of the characters but it didn't take long for me to figure out that this didn't matter to the author because it was supposed to be a plot-driven novel. Allegedly (if it is done right) if a novel is plot-driven you can get away with less than stellar character development. It is rare for an author to pull this off. The author of this book (Andrea Hairston) did not pull that off here. The plot was convoluted and did not really make much sense and I found the ending to be a ridiculous one that did not make any more sense than the rest of the book. I wanted to give up on the book and just chunk it and at 400+ pages it seemed endless at times....but I kept waiting for it to get better. To put it plainly, IT DIDN'T (get better that is). This was a huge waste of time. I'm sorry but this book just did not do it for me. Not a good one folks."
2,Not as pictured,"The color of the desk pad is totally different from what is shown. The style of the flowers has also changed for the 2007 calendar which makes the calendar TOTALLY different from the image given. If you are looking to buy a calendar that looks like the photo, do not buy this one!"
5,Simply a Beautiful Anime,"This anime is beautiful. The characters and plot are so well developed, and stuck by. I can't tell you anything the other reviewers haven't really covered, except this one fact that I find interesting:The character's names, translated from Japanese, fit them beautifully:Toboe-Howling (Toboe is the hopeful one in the group,and the most sensitive; he is first to howl when things happen. When you first meet him, he howls :) )Kiba-Fang (When you watch and see Kiba, you'll understand ^.^)Tsume-Claw (Tsume is definently abiding by 'claw first and ask questions later...')Hige-Whisker (Hige is the laid back guy of the group, and he's aweful cute ;D)"
1,it had potential,"With great music and a setting that reminds you of ""Vampire Hunter D"" it sucks you into watching the series. The plot turns out to be terrible and the idea of where the wolves came from and where they are going is underdeveloped and disappointing. The animation is good, which is a must have for me, but it wasn't enough to redeem the series."
1,Can this thing go any lower?????????????????,"I am sorry but Wolf's Rain is probably one of the worst anime's to ever appear on the adult swim block. It's so bad it's laughable, and the sad thing is that it did have potential. But unfortunately you cant really go any where with crummy characters and plot line."
5,Awesome show.,"Great story, fluid animation, video quality is top-notch and the music is great. Also included in the limited edition artbox is the soundtrack CD, so if you're a fan of Yoko Kanno's music you'll love it."
4,Industry leader in compact combat apparatus.,"At first I was wary of using this shock resistant, tactical combat apparatus. It's crisp aggressive body and inline styling were very intimidating, though surprisingly mildly attractive, to the eye.Before use, I stopped to appreciate the sleek laquer and deep, rich mahogany basecoat. The hardware was all fresh and shiny, and emoted a sense of dependability, and rugged reliability. I was sure to increase my torque, and navigate even the harshest terrain after a training session.At an affordable price, the best warranty in the industry, and the highest safety ratings, this combat apparatus is sure to be champion piece in your garage.....Gym."
2,Just kidding?,"West Side Story is one of the most wonderful shows ever written, one of the most performed by amateur, stock and high schools. Among the countless recordings of this fabulous score, only the original Broadway cast is worth the trouble. As it seems, all these recordings wanted to create somthing new and different and strayed greatly form the original material, when there truly is no need for that. The music, the lyrics, the message, the magic are perfect as they are but most directors don't seem to agree and they change, adapt and lose some of the perfection along the way. The artists on this recording can sing, but in no way do they catch the wonderful message of a teenage boy and girl who fall hoplessly in love and the tragedy of hate and violence. When will there be a GOOD recording of West Side Story?"
3,Looks Much Better Than Its Quality,"Lets start with the PROS: It's looks great, very eye appealing, but for the price you can't expect a whole lot.CONS: leaves behind lots of finger prints; therefore, constantly having to wipe clean. Pump - you truly have to pump quite a bit to get substance really going. Find myself having to wipe clean after EVERY dishwash routine if not you are left with constant water spots which is not very attractive to leave sitting around.To RECAP: it is a very attractive piece; pump is slow to dispense liquid substance, and leaves quite a bit of cleaning after dishwashing."
1,boring,"Unable to finish. Atmospheric and pessimistic and miserable in the same way as Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, or Durrell's Alexandria Quartet. I hated all three of these books, and did not bother to finish Speedboat."
5,quick and easy with fantastic price,quick and easy with fantastic price. Couldn't have gone smoother. Way too many words just to rate a good product and service.
2,Could have been better,"After opening the book and answering the questions on chapter 1, I turned to the back of the book to where the answers should have been. Surprise! No answers anywhere. The questions were good, but I feel that the study guide would be of more help if it had included the answers to the questions (so that you would know if you are on the right track or not)."
2,Broke on day one,"The shipping was on time and the staff appeared to be in good condition, but when i actually used the staff it broke with almost no effort. i was lightly sparing with a friend (more like just going through the motions) and it broke with in 15mins. do not buy!"
4,"Just wanted a 6 ft plus walking stick, and got it","It came on time and was what was adv.Had no other dealings.I am happly with my order.Since this is not what they are normaly use for, it may not be much help."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"Ok, i purchased this book because from what it looked liked, it was gonna be good. Wow, was i wrong! First off, I decided to just thumb through it and check out some of the photos. Well, there are mislabled photos through out the book. They have a PPsH ejector port on the Thompson page. They have a Colt on the webley page. Kinda irk'ed me but i decided to start reading it. Several mistakes on the weapons. And the so called ""current collectors values"" is a JOKE. If the guns were actually worth as much as the author has them listed, I'd have a majority of them. But i don't cause almost ALL OF THEM ARE UNDER PRICED. He also has a 1918 Browning Automatic Rifle listed under rifles, but in all actuallity, it's a machine gun. I collect World War 2 weapons and this book is the biggest dissappointment of all the books that I have on the subject. I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND. Find something else rather than waste your money on this."
3,Not his best work,"Hard for me to dislike any book that reflects the tools and images fo the Great Wars.However I have to say that this book simply trys to woo the reader with its color pictures.Certainly not its detail or length of information.John Walter has abook Military Rifles of Two world Wars which is far superior to this one in details even if limited to rifles only.Granted, Sudermondt does include machineguns motarsand antitank weapons,I guess I just got sore a tthe way he categorized some weapons like Mausers."
5,An absolute must read,"This book is an absolute must read for the physician that is joining, buying, or merging into a practice as well as any accountant, lawyer, or consultant diving into this arena!!"
5,A must have for every esham fan,"This is not your church or mothers and fathers music but this is a great album. Great samples like other esham albums. Samples from Jimi Hendrix voice on Manic Depression, and another guitar/drum sample from purple haze on the beginning and the ending of don't blame me. Then sampling Men at work's song who can it be know on freak nasty. This is one of eshams best works."
1,DOO DOO BROWN,"THIS GUY IS SSOOOOOOOO WACK IT HURTS.....HE RECYCLES SO MANY LINES AND EVERY ALBUM OF HIS THAT YOU BUY HAS THREE TO FOUR DUPLICATE TRACKS FROM THE ALBUM BEFORE JUST WITH A DIFFERENT BEAT. ITS RIDICULOUS....WHAT ARE THEY PAYING HIM FOR. HE DOESN'T EVER COME WITH ANY NEW MATERIAL....HIS KKKILER FETUS ALBUM HAD NUMEROUS RECYCLED SONGS FROM THE CLOSED CASKET ALBUM AS DID THE GOTHAM CITY CD.....JUST LIKE THE HELLTER SKELLLTER ALBUM , AND ALL OF HIS SUBSIQUENT ALBUMS FOLLOWED SUIT....HOW ARE THESE PEOPLE GIVING HIM 5 STAR REVIEWS, I HAVE LOST ALL HOPE IN HIP HOP. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ORIGINALITY."
5,super cd,"this complication is just amazing,super tracks from alphazone and other djreally a good buy"
4,A Twist on Tetris,"This is a good game for those who like Tetris. The rotating and dropping of different shape blocks to fill lines is a familiar concept but the goal in this game is to fill up the screen. The player chooses the level of difficulty. To make the goal more challenging, as the game progresses more item come along to knock your character off the stack or to demolish building blocks. The game has a few other playing modes including one in which the player is trying to destroy the opponents tower first. A tutorial mode is included. The game is quick to learn and fun to play if you enjoy puzzle games."
3,nearly there!,"would give it a 5 stars if its has the external on-off switch. instead, you need to unwind the battery cap, pull-out and rotate the battery compartment to switch its on-off. apart from that, everything is work fine bright green light, finishing, waterproof."
4,fantastic singing,"As an introduction to bel canto this cd is a good place to start. Marilyn Horne's rich mezzo is not what was originally intended for this music, but it sounds wonderful nonetheless. Her rendition of ""Fammi Combattere"" and ""Or La Tromba"" is stirring stuff, while the famous aria ""Lascia chi'o pianga..."" is tenderly sad.The only drawback is the recording of the orchestra: it sounds a little thin and murky, with little instrumental differentiation, which suggests poor microphone placement and mixing (even with digital recordings it's how you use the technology...). Sometimes Horne's voice is also a little too far back in the mix, even though she's bellowing gustily. As a record of a fine vocal performance, though, this is great stuff."
5,LEg stretcher,I absolutely LOVE this stretcher! VERY CONVENIENT. Gives ability to stretch while standing and holding stance for martial artists or dancers. Great piece of equipment to have.
4,Cable leg Streacher,"I think this is a very good item for increasing flexibility in a persons back leg muscles. Streaching is very important because it can greatly reduce the risk of injury for every kind of sport whether it is karate, baseball, football, basketball, tennis, etc.."
1,Very Disappointing,"After comparing the book and the ""topics covered"" section from ETS, I found that the book and the practice questions addressed only a few of those topics. Hardly worth the money."
1,Joke of a study guide,"I was absolutely appalled at the number of typos, grammatical errors(incomplete sentences gallor!)which make the book unreadable. There are duplications of entire pages, not just paragraphs. In addition, there are numerous inaccuracies in the chemistry and physics! It resembles a rough draft manuscript of a ""Tell Us What You Know about Science"" project that middle school students would have compiled, typed, cut-and-pasted and then bound together. No adult could have possibly proofread this ""study guide"" .It is in no way something a middle school pre-service teacher could possibly use to study for the PRAXIS II!"
2,Dissapointed,"Finally, a study guide has been released to help us study for the Praxis II - Middle School Science test. Unfortunately, I was shocked to see the number of errors throughout the book. Mistakes ranged from typos and incorrect grammar to duplicating entire paragraphs. One or two mistakes are understandable, but the book is completely filled with errors. It is as if they released a rough draft (can't they afford proofreaders?) Due to the poor editing, I am forced to question the reliability of the content."
4,No filler! Packed with Information!,"So there's a few typos, this is the only book I found that covers all the topics of the 0439 Praxis exam. I am started to not understand why Xam would discontinue such a great book! This book is packed with information on everything you need to know for the test. I am also questioning why so many people gave it a bad review... The book is technical enough, but also gives real life examples that make it easier to digest the information.The test in the back is a full 120 question test with explainations to the answers. The test is not accurate to the real thing it gives too many lab safety questions, but is a good basis as to where you stand on the test. The only other fault it there's no diagrams of confusing topics what would be more helpful.Hopefully you can get your hands on one for around $50-$70I refused to pay the outragous out of print prices"
1,THE SONGS SELECTED WERE GREAT BUT NOT THE OUTCOME.,I AM A BIG JOHN ARPIN FAN BUT SOMETIME WITH HIS MUSUC IT IS HIT OR MISS. WITH THIS PROJECT HE SURE MISSED HIS MARK. THIS IS A FOUR CD PACKAGE BUT OUT OF ALL THOSE SONGS I ONLY LIKE 7 SONGS. HE SEEMED TO DO A VERY POOR JOB ON HIS ARRANGEMENTS. HOPE IN HIS FUTURE CDS HIS AIM WILL BE BETTER.
5,"NOK - ""Vent""ing Their Frustrations","OK Hnads down heavy / loud rock album of the year. This band has it all for the loud rock fan. After playing shows with Godsmack, Reveille, Static-X, Type O Negative, PUYA, The Step Kings, TREE, Madball, Eastcide, Earth Crisis, Nothingface, Spineshank, Sam Black Church and countless others, NOK is ready to hold their own. They have played the Massachusetts Metal and Hardcore Festival Main Stage in 1999 and the CMJ Music Marathon in NYC 1998. As soon as I got this cd it didn't leave the player for about a month. It is a regualr on the WTBU 89.3 FM Boston playlist."
3,Not so tough...,"Pencil with an eraser not required. Most are ten minute puzzles typical of the morning paper. There is one exception in my view: Watch out for any puzzle by Eric Albert - his are really hard. I think it wasn't until the third (maybe fourth; have to check how many of his puzzles are included) before I got into his way of thinking but still had two clues I couldn't get. This book has 250 puzzles, so can be a good book for the doctors office where you know you'll be waiting and need a lot of puzzles to go through."
2,Not dishwasher safe,"I had this on my wish list because it was the size that I needed plus it was pink - I love everything pink. My husband bought it for me as one of my anniversary gifts, but when I opened it I found out that you can't put it in the dishwasher. Who makes pots and pans that can't be put in the dishwasher? It's beautiful and I'd love to keep it, but there's no way I would want a stockpot that has to be washed by hand. Most cooks would want to know that up front before they purchase it. The description of the item does not mention this detail, and I think it should, therefore I gave it 2 stars. I will be returning this item."
1,WARNING: Contains Torture of Cats and Kittens,"I'm usually able to tolerate animal cruely in small doses, but this one makes for excruciating reading if you like cats/kittens. By page 47 we have cat mutilation, a litter of kittens hanging to death off a tree, firecrackers stuck into a cat's butt and ignited, powdered glass mixed into meat and fed to cats, a kitten placed in a container and the container kicked like a football until the kitten is dead..you get the picture. This torture was simply too much for me and I had to put the book down."
1,I fell asleep.,"I know there is alot of controversy around this book, here in Hawaii and in Asian America... I just wish this contributed to my enjoyment of this book. I can't say much because I don't remember much. Some cardboard characters shuffling in the dust...an occasional rainfall. I read some poems of Yamanaka's that I thought were great, so this was a double disappointment. In spite of the fact that the characters exist in a working class world, the world they breathe seems nostalgic and false. I have a feeling the author looks on them from a window."
4,Accurate Portrayal of Kids in Hawaii,"As a former teacher on Oahu and visitor to Molokai, I can attest to the accuracy of this particular narrator's experience in growing up in the not-always-paradise atmosphere of the islands. That's not to say that every child has this kind of rough experience, but Hawaii is a multicultural society, and there is sometimes conflict among children of different ethnic backgrounds. The characters are full-bodied and believable. The widowed father's deep sadness at the loss of his wife, the narrator's attempts to protect her reckless brother, her own awareness of danger: completely believable. And it all takes place in a well-described location, possibly of interest to those who have been to the more well-known Hawaiian Islands. I'm giving this book as Christmas gifts to friends this year."
3,Good but Brutal,"This book has a wonderful, evocative style. It richly conveys the environment of a poor life on Moloka'i, and also the minds of children. Ordinarily I love stories about kids trying to cope with extreme hardship, but I had to put the book down because the descriptions of cruelty to cats was too much for me. She is a talented writer, though."
5,This is the real life,"Raunchy? Yes. But nevertheless a moving and sad story.. The characters breathe, and you live with them. Many thanks to the author for not writing one of those ""growing up"" stories that are so squeaky clean and laundered like a TV serial"
5,Grrrreat Book!!!,"This book gave insight into what it must have been like to live, destitute, without a mother, on the island of Moloka'i. Through the author's words, you could really feel for the characters, admire their strength, and sympathize when they were hurting. This was a marvelous read!"
2,Beware,"On this cd, ""The Boys Are Back In Town"" is a rerecording. This is not the original song that you hear in the movie ""Another 48 Hrs."". This version is not too bad but the original is the one that rocks. The weird thing about this song is that the soundtrack from ""Another 48 Hrs."" doesn't even have the Bus Boys version on it. It has a sad version by jesse johnson, and I mean sad.The best songs on the album are ""Comeback"", ""Rockin'& Rollin' In Lodi"", ""Don""t Let Go"" (This is the old song by Issac Hayes) and ""Ain't Thru Rockin'"". There is also a bonus song on this cd that is real hard to find. It is a good song too, but I can't think of the name of it right now. It starts about one minute and 43 seconds after the last song on the cd ends. There is a total blank for 1 min. & 43 secs. and then the song wil start up. The song is about 4 minutes long. You will know it because when the last song ends the cd does not end."
3,48 HRS with Eddie Murphy,I felt the band The Bus Boys were Kickin' It appeared to me that Eddie Murphy probably got them the gig as it fit his character perfectly. I am STILL not sure why these guys didn't go from busing tables to the Big Time Musically??
3,pretty good,It wasn't what I thought it was but it still came in good condition and I still came up with some great ideas for my scrapbook.
5,Equipment that actually works,My decision to purchase a leg stretcher was after going for a bike ride and I had to lean the bike to get on and off it because my legs wouldn't stretch enough to just swing my leg over the bar. I looked at many leg stretchers and this one sounded the best especially with the variable fine increments of stretching possible. It works! Having had and used this for a month I can actually swing my leg over a bike without leaning the bike. Best stretching exercise I've tried and it has made me a believer in stretching.
2,Pro leg Stretcher very cheap,Bought this Stretcher the first day I used it I was getting out of it and the seat snapped. Very thin plywood and pading Iam going to keep it and reinforce my self it works but very cheaply built they could have done a much better job for very little money the worm gear works great but wouldnt buy again
4,Protects and is cute,I love the different colors offered and how this protects the body of the Zune. It doesn't offer protection to the screen itself but it does allow access to the controls of the Zune with no problem.
2,Poor quality.,"I ended up returning this lunch bag. Its compartments are cumbersome/awkward, not useful & its materials seemed cheap. I would not recommend this."
3,Interior lining torn after 4 months of use,Nice lunchbox size and the exterior strap is handy for my son to use to carry his lunch separate from his backpack. This lunch cooler lasted for 4 months and then the interior (white) lining ended up torn (3 inch tear and 1 inch tear) in two places. Otherwise this is an ok lunch cooler.
4,Holds more than expected,Not much for words about this product except I would purchase it again. Items stay cold pretty much all day. Good product.
4,In the bag !,Excellent construction...worth the price. Can easily be a lunch tote for two (2). Zippers stick occasionally..but opens smoothly with patience and care !
5,Mary Poppin's would be jealous!,"I bought this lunch tote for my dad - I believe 6-9 months ago. So far no complaints. The bag holds a good amount of stuff, and it's nice to have the compartment on top to put granola bars and other items you may not want squashed in with your frozen/refrigerated items."
4,Roomy Lunch Cooler,A good lunch cooler. Pleanty roomy. It is nice to have two sections to divide the food. Priced reasonably.
4,Lunch cooler,"Originally I thought the cooler would be smaller, but overall I really like it. I think the insulated top is great."
5,Great!,"This bag is definiataly for every day use. My husband takes it every day to work. I can pack for him everything in there. Usually it's a big container and 2 small ones in the main area, and in the top portion I put another medium size container with fruits.He loves it, and I feel good as now I can put whatever he likes for lunch! :-)"
3,Too big to carry lunch for everyday work,I bought this bag to carry lunch to my work.But it is too big and incovenient to carry.This product is not suitable for everyday use.It can be used during short holiday trips or picnics.
5,Great for my lunches,I take my lunch to work 3-4 days a week.I eat many small meals throughout the day.Plenty of room.Holds about 3 meals for me.
3,good design and price--iffy quality,"as others have noted, the zipper is quite weak.perhaps this is a case of getting what one pays for?"
2,Cooler was defective but otherwise decent,"received a brand new in plastic cooler, it seemed to be of decent size, not big enough for my needs (work 12+hours a day so multiple meals had to be stored)it would have received a 5 star review however the manufacturer had put the cooler together rather sloppily. The zipper compartment has two zippers however the zipper track on the top half of the cooler was sewn improperly thus making it impossible to get one zipper to go past that point. no matter how much I tried to fix it, it was not something that could be remedied. it was returned and I purchased a larger cooler.do not hesitate to buy this cooler, its materials are superb however make sure you inspect your cooler first before throwing away the packaging materials."
2,Zippers only lasted one month,"Cooler did a decent job of keeping things cold, but the zippers didn't last long. There are two zippers so that you can zip from either side. Within 2 weeks one of the zippers broke. Within another week the other zipper kept getting caught in the teeth until eventually the teeth would no longer interlock at all. Have no choice to throw it away after one month of use."
5,Very satisfied,"I've had this product for about 6 months - so far, it's held up well to daily use, seems very sturdy, and does a sufficient job keeping things cold. Definitely good for the price, I'd buy it again if I had the purchase to do over."
5,cooler,this is a nice little lunch cooler nothing much else to say about it well worth the money would buy again shipped and rec on time.
4,Insulated Lunch Cooler,"Arrived on time and was roomier then expected. Also, having the separate compartments keeps your food from getting smashed."
4,Lunch Box,Great lunch box. Good size and nice that it separates warm cold food. I didn't give it 5 stars though because it doesn't hold it's shape well. But it's not like the food gets squashed or anything.
1,If its not brooke don't fix it,wow this is an aweful CD. If something isn't broke don't fix it and Steven Schwarts original soundtrack is one of the most amazing things I've ever heard and this one is just aweful. It changes the sounds and takes everything away from the show.
1,Horrible Customer Service,"The dart sets are ok and worth the price, however, Regent Sports, which distrubutes this product, has horrible customer Service. It has been over 3 weeks and no response to my emails and phone calls."
1,Hardwood?,"I don't believe this Jo is made from hardwood. It is very lightweight and dimples easily. After I received the Jo it felt as if it wasn't very solid. To test this, I wrapped my white oak bokken onto the Jo with just a little force and it put a large indent into the wood of the Jo. I am not an expert on wood by any means, but it certain doesn't seem to perform like the Jo at the Dojo, be it weight or hardness."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is nothing more than a sheet of thin and brittle mylar. To call it a ""desk protector"" is an exaggeration unworthy of Amazon. The other reviewer who is using this as clear film over framed photos has the better idea. I was hoping to use this to protect a work surface and make it easier to clean up spills, but it was shipped to me in a flat package (dumb) and since it likely folded in transit, the plastic sheet already had several deep creases upon arrival. Just not worth the money."
3,Dated and not U.S. relevant,"Written for the British contractor, this book has some good ideas, and alot of outdated ones. Also alot of irrelevant suggestions for California. I would have done better just skimming the web for suggestions."
1,NEVER AGAIN,Its been weeks and NO shipment NO email response NO Nothing its like you never placed the other at all. Completely unreliable and just plain rude. I DO NOT recommended this seller AT ALL.
4,a life-changing book!,"Beautifully illustrated and full of wisdom, the book, Maui-Maui, was one of the major influences which caused me to become an environmentalist.I remember when I read it, it wasn't a totally comfortable experience (but then neither was Orwell's brilliant political allegory ""Animal Farm""); the ""anenomies"", who over-fish the ocean in the story, can be seen as a metaphor for humans, and it was an uncomfortable experience for me to identify with these creatures in the story, when I realised that they were causing such destruction. But who ever said learning and developing wisdom were painless?Then again, I also have fond memories of the book - which is why I wrote this review. It's a great book! So if you want to foster an environmental consciousness in a child, I say give them this book! I know I will :)"
2,Too heavy handed,"The Amomonies (small, furry, otter-like beings) love to fish. They happily pull fish, octopi, and so forth out of the ocean from their little boats. Then, one day, they find a whale moves to prevent their fishing. Thinking that the others are lying, Mom Amomony sets out to discover the truth. The whale confronts Mom Amomony, and shows her that her children are over-fishing, and depleting the ocean. The whale then teaches the Amomonies how to live in harmony with the ocean.To me, where the rubber hits the road is what does my seven-year-old think of the book, and he hated it. This book is too heavy handed in the lesson, and doesn't do enough for the reader. The text was about right for his reading level, but a younger reader could probably read it as well.My son gives this book one star; I give it an extra one for the lesson. Overall, I recommend you pass this one by."
4,Good book to use as a starting point.,"I am really intrigued whenever I read a brand new mystery or suspense thriller, which is why I thought about writing mystery short stories. Hence, I purchased this reference book in hopes that it will inform me about everything I need to know behind law enforcement. It does give details on the legal system, the police force and criminals. The author discusses crimes and has a lists of weapons. It does provide minor information on police procedure and ""cop talk."" In addition, there are extensive lists on books to look at for more information. However, this book does have its flaws. It only contains brief paragraphs on some topics, so don't rely entirely on this book for information to write your novel or short story. It is a detailed book, but does not include as much info. as I had originally hoped."
5,Crime Start,"THE WRITER'S COMPLETE CRIME REFERENCE BOOK by Martin Roth is an excellent beginning for mystery fiction. Yes, it has been around for fifteen years and today there are several entire books for every chapter of the title, but it is still one of the best. This is especially true if the story is prior to 1993.A must for every mystery writer's reference shelf for there are many times when all you need for a particular story is a general overview, not a full-fledged in depth report.It has a detailed index for a quick search to give you information for doing a web search with the correct terminology.Writing as a Small BusinessSins of the Fathers: A Brewster County NovelUnder the Liberty OakNatchez Above The River: A Family's Survival In The Civil WarGuns Across the Rio: A Texas Ranger in Old Mexico"
2,Cute but unsafe...,This chair is very cute and matches the train table. But I must warn you that it tips over very easily. It is not very safe. Please watch your children when they use it. My 2 and 3 year olds have both fallen off it it. Luckily they weren't hurt.
3,"Good price , cheap product not sturdy",You get what you pay for here. I still can not get the thing installed properly without it falling apart after three days.
2,Not the best quality,"I paid more for shipping this item than the item itself. It was very cute, however, it was falling apart the minute I took it out of the bag. Very poor quality! Luckily, I had extra velcro pieces in my sewing kit and was able to stick the peas back on the costume."
4,Newborn Baby Pea in the Pod Halloween Costume,"It's precious, but was a little big for my granddaughter who was born Oct. 19th. She can probably wear it again for Mardi Gras."
3,"Cute, but poorly put together","When I put this costume on my daughter, the first thing she did was grab the peas. However, they weren't glued on very strong and she pulled the pea right off of the velcro. After I re-glued the costume, it was very cute."
3,"Poor quality, but shipped on time and looks like photo","This is an adorable costume. The quality is poor with thin material and missing/ poor velcro on the peas. However, I read this in the other reviews so I was prepared. I'm still glad I ordered it as the babes looked adorable and you really don't need a Halloween costume to last long. Had to replace all the Velcro before we used it and even then we lost the peas throughout the night repeatedly as the Velcro wouldn't hold."
4,Very Cute!,"This costume is adorable! The only problem is that the velcro came off of one of the peas, so we just super glued it back on. Everyone loved this costume!"
4,Worked out well for my 2 month old,"This costume looked very cute, and was a good fit for my 2 month old (23 inches long and 11.5 lbs). It wasn't too uncomfortable for him, and he tolerated it very well. When I took it off, I could see that the velcro closing in the back had irritated his neck a little bit, but it couldn't have been too bad, because he didn't complain. The little hat was just adorable and really made the outfit."
4,Good value but GIANT,"This is an absolutely adorable costume and well worth the money but it has a couple of drawbacks:- Had to sew the peas on permanently - the velcro fasteners fell off (they were just glued on).- It's enormous, so it didn't really fit my daughter until she was 9 months old.That said, there's nothing quite as touching yet entertaining as seeing your baby dressed in a peas-in-a-pod costume...it really makes the ""aawww's"" come out.Also, in case you can't decide what to dress your baby in for the first Halloween:I was debating whether to dress her as a bunny or as peas and a friend said, ""she can always be a bunny, but it seems to me she can only be a peapod her first year."" Good advice. Somehow almost symbolic of life's early journey itself."
1,Cheap,This costume was awful. Thank God we had a backup costume. The peas tear off easy and the fabric was very itchy. I hightly don't recomend this for any baby.
4,Has a very nice feel...,"I bought this jo to practice Aikido techniques with. I made the mistake of letting my son use it. I will probably not see it again. It has a very nice feel to it and is very solid. It is not to heavy to practice with although I haven't tried to hit anything hard with it. I think it could stand up to some punishment. I have ordered a second and will probably have to order another if my grand daughter gets a hold of this but it will be worth it. If you are looking for a solid jo for practice or defense this would be a good choice. In fact you might want to get two.36"" Hardwood Han Bo"
1,Curved Hanbo,"I first noticed that it seems to either be a sawed off Jo or maybe even a half of a Bo. But, the darn thing has now begun to curve after a month. I now have a curved Half-Bo. But, I must admit, when the product said Hanbo (Half-Bo) it really wasn't kidding.On January 23rd, 2011 this Hanbo broke under conditions that are not acceptable. Apparently, it only feels strong but it's really quite weak. I think it's made it out of ash. Though I will say that my training partner had a significantly stronger hanbo and it just could not withstand the impacts of a stronger hanbo; even at 50% striking power."
1,Inferior Product,"If you're looking for a quality han-bo, keep looking. This one isn't worth the money. As others have stated, one end is nicely rounded while the other had a crude chopsaw cut. In addition, mine was terribly warped. Isn't it sad when something as simple as a stick isn't up to par?"
5,"Smells amazing and my hair is polished, no frizzies","I really like Nature's Gate. I've tried so many other brands out there, but this one is the best. And much more economical; the last shampoo I got was around $22! I would recommend this to anyone. Plus, they don't do any animal testing and don't use any animal by-products. The Chamomile smell is one of their nicest."
4,Good buy for beginners.,"This is a great book for all who wants to learn about networking. This books shows with a easy language all the essencial part of networks, like cabling, topologies, protocols and more. This book is said to help your own studies to the MCSE certification, but it goes far beyond: anyone who wants to learn about networking can easily read this book."
3,Not Good Enough,"Besides being riddled with errors, the sample questions were generally not meaningful. It is, however, easy reading and does have the necessary information. If you must rely on this book, I suggest that you make the Networking Essentials exam your last exam. I skimmed this book and was still able to pass thanks to the information I picked up from studying for other exams."
2,Not Worth The Money - Buy Any Book But This One,"Nothing like the NT Workstation version. NE is poorly written and has so many errors in the practice tests as to render the book worthless. As an example, the authors ask the same question in the same chapter but give two different answers. Use brain dumps and cram sessions to review for your exam, NOT THIS BOOK."
2,"Decent content, poorly written, frustrating errors","I feel that the content of this book is adequate for passing the exam, however it seems as if this book was put together in a rush. The answers in the back of the book frequently do not correspond to the questions being asked. I was dissapointed by a couple of technical flaws. In section 14.4.2 for example, the author states that if you know that the voltage in a cable is 50 ohms, the cable is unbroken... This is not true, Voltage and Resistance are different and cannot be referred to as the same. I may have misunderstood the statement, but a good writer doesn't leave the reader confused."
2,Don't buy it .. Trust me.,- You will face alot of terms that will confuse you (in some how) and did not explained at the same time but in later chapters ! - There is no accurate graphics or illustrated images. - SAM has dissapointed me .. but it is OK.
2,The folk's at Sam's dropped the ball on this book.,"Well, I gave this book 2 stars for effort.I found way too many typo's, and I hope the folk's at Sam's Publishing do a better job of proof reading their material before placing it on the market. Better luck next time Sam's."
3,Not for creative dogs!,"My dog can get into it even when I put a lock on it. The lock is on the top, not opposite the side hinge (which I think would work better), and the door opens enough for her to get food out. She's a master at getting things open, I admit, but keep it in mind if you dog is, too. I'm goign to try the vittles vaults. I hope the twist top lid on those is enough to foil her efforts, but I imagine she will figure it out as she has every other container I have ever bought. Usually within about ten minutes.Also, weight estimate is not for dog food. I can't even get 25 lbs in mine without spilling."
2,OK for the price but,product is OK for the price but....1. It holds 1.2 cubic feet. It only holds about 25 lbs of the brand of dry dog food we use. Don't go off the weight listed.2. Container is made of the lightest/thinnest allowable level of plastic. It might hold up just fine but will not know for a few years.3. Container door is not air tight. If we have food in it for a long time I assume it will get stale.
5,Must have containers,"I purchased these stackable storage containers for our cat and dog food to take up less space and provide something to keep the food from spilling over and from getting stale. These did all of the above, the resin is strong and doesn't give under pressure. I love the containers and may just want to purchase more in the future for other organizational containers."
5,Good container for dog food!,Holds the 30lb bag of dog food we bought with no problem. Don't know if it's gonna hold up to 40lbs though.
5,Best idea ever,"We got this to stop the dogs,cats and the wild animals from tearing into our bags of dog food and it works. I one for our cat food and one for our dog food. It works. no more messy bags laying around, we have had these for over a year and they are still working prefectly."
2,Much Smaller Than Expected,This was WAY smaller than I expected it to be. There is NO WAY it will hold 35-40 lbs of dog food. It looks like it would barely hold 15 lbs. I'm sending it back.
5,Very convienent,"Have a dog and cat, so I own two of these products. I stack them on top of each other and keep it in the kitchen in the corner, it is so much easier to get my pets' food now without having to use their bag. I highly recommend it!"
2,Standard Quality,"I have practiced martial arst for a while, my sensei started teaching eskrima kali and the stick i bought was of an average quality at one of the borders there were a few cracks (defects from the bamboo wood) that makes this stick weak for kumite(combat) only for Techniques....."
2,Comments For Kindle edition only,"This appears to be an excellent diet, and the book is packed with good information. Unfortunately, it's also rife with charts and tables that are unreadable on the Kindle. I have pretty good eyesight for reading, and I can't make out much of the daily diet plans, the BMI chart, etc. It'd probably be a better idea to buy the print edition of the book."
4,Interesting diet theory.,"Interesting diet theory. Not new, but still valuable. The price was terrific and I do get lots of use our of it."
1,I Didn't Like It Either,"[...] I purchased this. What a disappointment.There's a chapter that tells you what to do if the diet doesn't work. One suggestion is to count the carbs in black coffee! Because you're probably eating too many carbs. I don't think so! I'm not kidding, it actually says that...I mean are we morons?I'm going back to Atkins."
3,She's a good singer.,"I wasn't all that impressed with this, but I got it after seeing her live. Good Lord, the woman is an amazing singer! but this one just didn't do it for me. I suspect someone who's more familiar with Mozart than I am would have more appreciation for it."
5,like a bird,"Sumi Jo's voice is so purely beautiful; she is my favorite soprano when it comes to singing Mozart, especially Queen of the Night. Hands down, she owns that aria. Her technical ability is perfect as she breathes song, and the beauty of what you hear is touching in such wonderful clarity. My review can only fall short in my humble attempt to convey to you why you need to hear her voice. The music she produces transcends the earthly. It is dazzling beyond words."
3,precious and few are these moments we two can share,"A strange little book full of mean spirited shock. The graphic design does not age well, but taken in context it's well worth it.From an age before blogs I hunted this down because it was something one couldn't find online.There was something fun and precious about reading it in public and hoping no one looked over my shoulder.Is it real, is it satire? Either way the book leaves you naked in a world of peeping Toms and transforms every open space into a concentration camp.I only wish I could meet the author."
4,Gentle Mozart,"This is a nuanced and gentle version of the Magic Flute. The music is in the more subtle turn of phrase, rather than any more dramatic means of making music like faster tempi, exaggerated dynamics or the like.It's one of the most consistent versions I've heard. The singers all have a similar touch. I'd say if it's missing one thing, it's a sense of it being in German. Even though it is sung in German, it doesn't sound like it hardly at all. All of the pronunciations are very soft.The orchestra underneath sounds very nice and is consistent with the singers. Having heard a bunch of recordings, I wouldn't start with this one. But, there certainly isn't anything wrong with it. I think one version I prefer a little bit better is the one with Rene Pape."
2,Tech Issues in a Gimmicky Game,"This game is quite addictive. For an hour or so after you open the box. And then this game (which I ran on a G4 256 RAM) will start to quit often, and then you will have to reinstall it several times to get it to work. The rides are gimmicky, and the options are limited. Those who are interested in a fairly unsophisticated yet interesting game should purchase this. However, those without a lot of a time on their hands should look elsewhere, as you will spend as much time fixing it as you will playing. Also, those who are interested in a more difficult game with more options should look at another game-for some people this game is great, but for others it really lacks a lot of features, like designable rides that aren't roller coasters, that are often preferred by those more experienced in Sim games. However, I gave this game to a younger relative who enjoyed it greatly."
1,"Confusing, with serious tech problems","It's simple at first, and kind of fun. However, as the game progresses, the roller coasters and attractions get harder and harder to figure out. The game (even with my G4 Cube) often freezes, and even in the game itself your rides break more often than natural (if you get my drift), the people you hire to fix rides and clean up the park stop doing their jobs even when you place them DIRECTLY in front of a problem. In the full version, all the little details confuse you to the point your head will almost explode. The people in your park get more and more impossible to please. It's more frustrating than fun."
3,Sim Theme Park (Mac),"This is a great game. It features 4 different themes: Dinosaur land, Space land, Halloween land, and Fairy land. I have to rate this game with a ""3"" because this game CRASHES quite often. I have 128 MB of RAM w/ VM turned on and it still crashes. Hopefully, there will be updates over the internet."
1,Disappointed!,Very unhappy with the purchase of this software! Per the maker of the game...they are having problems with it running on aMAC computer....we found this all out after we had tried to install it! (and had to go on the Company website for support) Of course they do not let you know that prior to purchasing the software.....so now they have our money and we have useless software along with very disappointed kids! :(Stay away from this item and maybe others made by this Company!
2,any help?,"when i bought this game and instald and ran it it came up with a message saying ""engine failed to initalize"". i have a power mac G4 that meets all requirements but ..i only gave this game a low raiting because i can't get it to work.but if i could get it to work i probily would give it a 5."
1,Waste of Money,"The packaging looks great. When you first download it it looks great. 2 days later it's about the worst game you've ever seen. The graphics stink.Compared to Roller Coaster Tycoon, it's horrible."
2,to work or not to work...,When i first got this game when i was in 5th grade (about 4 yrs ago) it was a lot of fun and really addicting. I played it just about everyday and i never got tired of but after awhile the game just stopped working. I would try to open it and it would do the Bullfrog thing but then my screen would go black and i would have to restart my computer. It did this every time and i must have re-installed it about ten times. After that i just gave up on it.
3,Great but has issues,"I founf this game really fun but VERY slow in buy mode, sometimes you can't even buy anything."
5,This game is a real blast! Yeah!,"I like this game. It is cool. My mommy and dady gave it to me for kristmiss. I like it because you can do stuff that you cannot do in Sim City. -that was my son- I think this game is great for the whole entire soccoijian familia yeayayee. We have played this game for minutes at a time!!!!!!! It is an addictive one for the whole entire soccoijian familia yeayayee. Buy it and your life will be filled with golden rabbit colors for the whole entire soccoijian familia yeayayee. Also, click the yes button down there. It will be very nice."
3,16 year old telling about a game called sim theme park,"The games I have seen online have not been too great. But I think that this game looks pretty good, but I am really not sure because I haven't ever played it."
4,Increased my grip,This product works great. I mean you feel this working the entire hand and your forearms as well. The only drawbacks I think about this thing is that its really uncomfortable and I never really feel anything in my pinky. I feel all the pressure on my other four fingers though. All in all it a good hand workout and much better then other contraptions I've bought in to.
2,Was better in the 80's.,"I watched this movie as a teenager in the 80's and for some reason it stuck in my mind. I had two reasons to watch it again, Kathy Shower and the seaplane. Having re-watched it, those are the two worthwhile reasons to see it now. Very low-budget, which I don't mind, but also very poor acting and poor plot."
5,Worthy of an Oscar,Davey is the greatest actor ever. Humphrey Bogart? John Wayne? Tom Cruise? Role stealing Leo?? Davey is the greatest actor of our generation. Those other guys are chumps. My buddy slash thinks he is the best too.
4,Decent flick from the 1980's-fun to watch! Adult theme.,"I saw this film back in the 1980's. It's about a guy who has grown up in and lives in a jungle. He meets a husband and wife who are looking for guide into a more dangerous area where cannibals reside. You some bare breasts and there are some sexual situations including a rape scene in the film. The ""R"" rating is well deserved. I am also a fan of David Keith who has acted in various TV programs and films over the years. Mr. Keith (not to be confused with the actor Keith David who is also very good and has a very long acting resume himself) directs this film as well as being the star. The acting is good and action keeps the movie going at a nice pace. If you like adventure via foreign travel, this flick is one to check out. Happy movie watching!"
5,Made hubby really happy,"He puts it out every game day and takes it back in at night. I'm sure it is one of his favorite Birthday presents ever! It is a good quality flag, especially if you treat it like your baby:)"
2,bolts missing from packaging to put it together.,not the highest build quality but ok.was missing 2 bolts to put it together! ugh! I may think better when I make it to store to get bolts...
4,Pleased,This is a gift for a relative who is getting back into shape and who practiced martial arts. Looks as pictured and is sturdy.
5,Excellent guide to a beautiful art!,"Bo Bergman might not yet be known outside Scandinavia, but here he has been one of the brightest shining stars in the area of creative knifemaking for over a decade. His book ""Knifemaking"" is a compilation of two of his bestselling books and it contains all the things you need to know to become a passionate craftsman.The instructions are very easy to follow and a lot of pictures and illustrations guide you through all the steps. Througout the text you can really tell that Bo Bergman not only knows what he is talking about, but also that he also loves what he is doing.I highly recommend this book to anyone that wishes to express themselves through a very beautyful and long lasting art."
5,taking a blade and turning it into a scandinavian knife,"The nitty gritty: does it allow you to craft a knife? I'm just completing my 2nd knife based entirely on this book, so for me--yes.The book assumes you have a blade and are interested in the scandinavian approach to turning it into a knife. There is some general discussion, but mostly it is a description of several projects involving different styles and materials in handle making and in sheath making. There is enough detail to allow you to 'join the dots' or use it as a basis for taking off on your own. It is also pleasant to see that the 'suggested tool kit' does not run into $$$$$$ or involve special use machines, which encouraged me to get going."
3,Don't Judge the book with its cover!,"if you are into making blades, this is not the book for ya! it might seems to be, but it isn't, it doesn't include instruction for making the blades itself. For me, it's more likely to be a wood working process rather than making knives itself.If you are fond of decorating your knives' sheats and handles, this is the book for you. it discusses more about handles and sheats more than the blade itself, it's a little bit frustrating because we don't usually have complete resources for blades, so making blades is really a need, and it even says ""complete guide to ...."". reminder for those, that you might consider this book a second option coz the title and contents itself seems to be misleading."
3,Do Not get your heart set on The Bag...,"I ordered (3) of these kits.. one would think I would get (3) of the same item. I did not. All 3 bags were different patterns and colors, None looked anything like the one pictured.(They look like the bedspreads U see in hotel rooms..) When I emailed them, they said ""Thank you for contacting us, we do apologize for the inconvenience so you are expiriencing. I have verified with my shipping department and the cosmetics bags that we receive are in assorted colors, on the site its states that the actual cosmetic bag is paisley print."" Thats not exactly what the listing says, it puts Paisley (not print) in Caps, making it sound like the particular bag shown.. And no the bags are Not 'Estee Lauder' bags...just thought You should know, since it doesn't look like they are going to correct their listing.."
2,Half Of It Is Nonsense.,"Salter's memoir is a pretty interesting yarn about soldiering in World War II, but about half of it is implausible. Like...every time Fred gets wounded he hides the injuries from the brass so he can remain with his buds. Sure. The brass try to promote him lotsa times but he turns them down to stay with his buds. But his buds keep dying! On one occasion he was dressed in rags and a general was so touched by Fred's devotion to America, he teared up for poor Fred.The self-promotion spoils a good read, but it's written well and engrossing."
3,Somebody call the WAAAAAMBULANCE!,"This book was not what I thought it would be. To me, especially towards the end of the book, it seemed that all she did was whine about how her show was canceled, the bad treatment she recieved on the set of Moonlighting, etc. I'm a firm believer in the ""what goes around, comes around"" and anything that happens to her is a result of what she has done to other people. Don't get me wrong, she actually did critize herself a few times and own up to past mistakes, which I thought was a start in the right direction. However, I've always believed that there are two sides to every story and I'm sure she isn't as saintly as she sometimes painted herself to be. It was an open insight into her life, as much as she was willing people to see."
2,What??,"Now, I know why this book was free to Kindle readers. I've only read three chapters so far, and they may be my last. Cybill used so many uncommon words that it was hard to stay focused on what I was reading and then re-reading it. The first two chapters were about how beautiful she is, and what a curse it has been......Pleeese! I really wanted to like this book but, I may never know how good it really is, or isn't!"
1,"I tried, I really did.","I wanted to read this book, but I couldn't make it past chapter 3. Too many typos - misspellings, missing words, etc. I got tired of trying to fill in the blanks for myself and gave up."
3,The WHOLE Story?,"As a fan of Cybill Shepherd, I enjoyed reading about her relationships, career (mis)adventures, and the glimpses behind the scenes of Moonlighting and Cybill. However, I often got the sense that I wasn't get the whole story about what went on during the production of those series. In her telling, it seems as if, suddenly, everyone hates her for no reason. (What I'd really like to read is a recounting of those series' troubled production histories written by a neutral third party who has interviewed all involved parties.) However, this book is Cybill's story from her point of view, so it's understandable that it would feel somewhat skewed. On a more positive note, she does not shy away from admitting her less-admirable actions and traits, and her voice comes through loud and clear, giving the reader a real sense of this unique woman."
2,Waited for the Laughs,"I was hopeful this would be an entertaining read based on other reviews that said it was funny and made them laugh out loud. It never made me laugh at all, I thought it was quite depressing. Cybill sounds like she has had a sad and rather uninteresting life. I didn't see much point in this book at all."
3,Honest but weird look into Hollywood lifestyle.,"You have to admire Cybill Shepherd for letting it all hang out in this revealing autobiography. This is a woman who has invoked strong feelings in most of her co-workers, mostly of the non-generous kind. Cybill tells her side of the story, and while I agree with her that she was undoubtedly often the victim of a sexist industry, it's clear that she bears more than a little responsibility for the problems. Also, the lady is more than a bit of a flake, but you've got to admire her willingness to follow her own path. Basically, this is a fun, gossipy read. Don't expect any earth-shattering insights."
2,Disappointed,"I hate to say it but I was disappointed with this book. Having watched Cybill Shepherd share her witt on television for years, I expected to find myself laughing throughout this book. Actually, there were very few stories that I found humorous. I was surprised with the lack of flow with the book and found it difficult to read at times."
2,Get over yourself!,"Talk about an ego! Cybill spends the majority of this book telling us how beautiful she is. The rest is spent on her sexual encounters. Is there any depth to this woman? If there is, I didn't see it. I feel sorry for her kids!"
3,Cybill jumps into bed with any man/ learns little with age.,"This is a very shallow book about Cybill's life. She tells all about her numerous, and I mean numerous affairs--Elvis doesn't care for oral sex, she engaged in a threesome with a stuntman,so on and so forth. Cybill constantly reminds the reader of her beauty, a picture of her and former lover Bogdonavich is quoted ""We're Peter and Cybill and you aren't"". Bruce Willis comments to her that he can't say his lines because she is so beautiful. And she feels that only God could love her for qualities other than her blondeness. Enough already-we all know you are beautiful Cybill. Cybill doesn't seem to grow much intellectaully with age through the book, but I guess she figures with her beauty... Buy this book if A) you want to read what makes her tick (her beauty and sexual relationships) B) You are interested in a sleezy, careless sexual lifestyle C) You need to be reminded that she is beautiful"
2,I WILL SAVE YOU TIME AND MONEY,"This ""book"" should be called - 'Ive had more men than a New York City public restroom - and I did not charge a quarter'. After reading that sentence you have learned and experienced all that is availible in this latest of a ""Help! My career is failing!"" publication. That is all you need to know. After this commentary... you have read the book."
4,Very entertaining,"I must say that though I am not particularly a fan of Cybill Shepherd, she has had a fascinating life, and her frankness and ability to talk about unpleasant points in her life without bitterness is quite refreshing. Though I'm sure many would assail her for writing a book that delves so explicitly into sex while she still has young children, I will point out that her oldest child is 20 and about to be married, and I doubt she will let her 12-year-olds read the sex parts. Meanwhile, the press certainly loved to trash Shepherd openly without any regard to her children; I'm sure they, and she, have learned to live with it by now.Shepherd's acting has never thrilled me (although I very much liked her undeservedly short-lived show ""Cybill""), but I admire her for her candor, her unapologetic self-confidence, and for her willingness to stand up for abortion rights. I don't see her as spiritually bankrupt. There are other types of spirituality besides Christianity."
2,"Didn't really know her before, don't care for her now","I didn't really know much about Cybill before reading this book. I had seen the Cybill show and thought it was funny (loved Mary Ann's character) so I figured I would enjoy this book. Well, not so much. Over and over Cybill states how beautiful everyone thinks she is and how she can use her looks to get anything she wants. Please. What an ego. I was also disturbed by the relationship she describes with her grandfather. She doesn't come right out and say it, but I suspect there may have been some sexual abuse going on. If you're not a die-hard Cybill fan and don't care to read about her continuous sexcapades, then don't bother with this book. There's really nothing of substance here."
3,Enough already with the Boasting,This was interesting but tedious. I should go back and count all the references Cybil makes throughout this book about how beautiful she is. Probably too many to count.
2,very boring,"I really thought that I would like this book, but I didn't. I got very bored reading about her sexual encounters (if that's the right term) with every man that she worked with, met, or otherwise encountered.I only recommend this book to die-hard fans of Ms. Shepherd and wish that I hadn't wasted my time with it."
4,Compelling Truth which always reads with sadness,"Cybill's life reads well... as smooth as a Tuesday Night Lifetime Movie. With all of her experiences and mistakes out in the open, its easy to understand what makes her tick. I felt as if she really opened her soul in the writing of this book; exposing someone sad and alone. She is a physically beautiful woman who obviously knows it. However we learn that being the object of men's affections and being happy have NOTHING to do with one another. I hope she finds peace and love."
1,A wasted life...,"This woman never met a man she wouldn't have sex with. Every time she was alone or insecure, she had sex with some new guy and she didn't discriminate, either, pairing off with many low charactered people which, frankly, is what Cybill appears to be.Nothing to show for her life lived. A bunch of disturbed relationships and nonrelationships, a lot of bragging and namethrowing, and a lot of enemies and people who disrespect her. This was such an empty person, based on her own self view, that I couldn't finish the book.I felt sad and disinclined to ever think of this person again when I deleted this from my Kindle."
2,Not what I expected...,"The reason I got this book for Kindle was because the reviews said it was laugh out loud funny. I needed a good laugh! However, half way through I thought ""this is truly tragic"". Cybill is honest and forthright which is admirable in a bio. The content is truly tragic, although she tries to mask it with humor. Sort of like J.D. Salinger in ""Catcher in the Rye"". Funny, but really sad at the same time. I'm glad Cybill had no regrets, but what a rough road she took in life. Actually, now that I'm more than halfway through, I may just stop reading. So I guess I wouldn't recommend it. It's starting to bore and irritate me."
2,She Still Loves Herself,"This book starts out with incompete thoughts and trys to impress the reader with the vocabulary. Cybill has lived 50 years, and learned very little. She thinks so highly of herself, that theres not much room for anything or anyone else. Skim the book cover, and you have the best part of this book."
3,"Like Her Or Not, Cybill Is Real!","I have to be honest. I read this book because it was free for Kindle.I am not a Cybil fan but, I have respect for her as an actress. I was too young to watch her on Moonlighting and never watched her on Cybill. I wanted to read this book because I found certain aspects of her life interesting: her modeling career, her affair with Elvis, her relationship with Peter Bogdanovich, and her years working with Bruce Willis on Moonlighting.This was a good autobiography. I felt like Cybill was being real. She told her story the way she saw it. I like that she is a ballsy women and a fighter. She had a lot of ups and downs in life. Unlike many celebrities she wasn't afraid to share some of her low moments. Cybill also has a sense of humor, is well spoken, and a good story teller. She is an avid reader and it showed in her work.I recommend this book to any Cybill fan or for people who love a good Hollywood story."
2,Am I reading the same book?,"I've always admired Cybill and found her interviews intelligent and interesting. This book is very sloppy and she comes off as half-baked. She also makes MANY mistakes. the song ""I'm a fool to want you"" becomes ""I'm a fool to love you"", she describes an orchestra as ""the 101 strings of Montovani"" when in fact they were two bands (101 String, Montovani and his orchestra) and worse, she credits Cole Porter with writing Noel Coward's Mad About the Boy. You also get the feeling she's not telling the whole story, especially when people are irrational or nasty to her."
1,should be titled: Cybill uses a thesaurus.,"I tried to read a free download of Cybill Shepherd's biography and in the first chapter she used words such as: cacophonous, megalomani, temerity, rancorously, eviscerated, dotage, impetus,paradigms, jermiads, and sobriquet! Duh! I consider myself an intellegent person but was turned off by all the unusual words. Did she really think her target audience would be impressed by this. I havent got past the first chapter yet and think maybe I should continue because of the other good reviews but I am so turned off by her need to appear to have a better vocabulary then the average reader."
2,Thank goodness it was free,"You know, I remember reading about the size of Cybill's ego in the tabloids back when she seemed relevant. Everyone says you shouldn't believe what the rags print, that the stories are skewed to sell papers not the truth, blah blah blah. Well, ""everyone"" was wrong. Geesh, if it was a paper book I'd need a dolly to have carried it with me. But I ordered it on the Kindle and thankfully it was on a day that offered it for free. Although there was still a cost...the brain cells that were permanently damaged while reading that awful thing."
2,A very generous two start.,"Another book proving that you get what you pay for - and it wasn't worth free. The writing is very uncomfortable. There are long muddy paragraphs that are not at all entertaining, and the writing is disjointed. I found that I really disliked Cybill by the end of the book. It was hardly a surprise that every person she 'hooked up' with or spent any time with removed themselves from all association with her. As poor as the writing was in this book, I can't believe that she has the nerve to criticize the writing and editing on her television shows. She claims to have learned life lessons and became introspective through therapy - NOT! She has a highly inflated ego and is a blamer. As my mother used to say, ""She thinks she's a little bit of all right."""
1,Cybill does Hollywood,The writing isn't bad although sometimes it would be nice to have a score card to keep up but it really should be called Cybill does Hollywood. Apparently all you need to do is glance at her sideways and she'll have sex with you. Funny how most of the guys don't hang around though. I guess everyone needs some claim to fame!
4,I found her story to be very interesting.,I thought this was a great read. I enjoyed it. I found it interesting how open Cybil was with her indiscretions. I don't believe in messing about with married men but she is honest about it which I respect.
4,Cybill bares all,"I needed a shower after reading this book. Ms. Shepherd shares her childhood, affairs, marriages and career with her fans. I for one thank her for being honest,however, some details can and should have remained private."
1,Waste of time,"I wanted to like this book. I had a very superficial knowledge of Ms. Shepherd, based on the ""Moonlighting"" series, and was curious to read about the woman behind the part. I enjoy reading autobiographies and gaining insight into others and hearing their stories. I can nearly always find something redeeming about the central character. I could find nothing in this book but irrational animosity, a lack of compassion, an overabundance of self focus, self righteousness, and much confusion about boundaries... and, frankly, a lot of poorly edited writing. If this book had been written by someone younger, at least there might be the consolation that there would be time for the character to develop emotionally. The book was disappointing, to say the least, and I'm very sorry to have read it. Not a legacy I would want to leave behind, or see anyone else leave behind."
3,Needs a proofreader!,"I enjoyed the book, but the hundreds (literally!) of typos and grammar errors were truly distracting. Thank you for dishing the dirt, making me laugh, and bringing on the nostalgia!"
2,Boring,"I found this book very very boring. It goes on about too much insignificant stuff and does not grab me anywhere along the way, disappointed thought it would be more interesting. Don't bother."
1,Cybil Disobedience,I thought more up to date Didn't like the vagueness of everything Couldn't wait to finish it Yuk Yuk Didn't like it at all
4,"Interesting story. Learn many things I didn,t know about Cy bill Shepherd.","I've read many biographies. This book got my attention from the start because Cy bill was not a mega star but lead a very interesting life. She seems very honest in describing event and people that influenced her life. Great story, I would recommend it for light reading."
1,Huge waste of time,"Thankfully this book was free because if I would have paid for it, I would have been very upset. This book is all about blaming people and sleeping with every man under the sun. Married or not. She has no morals it is easy to see. She claims to be beautiful throughout the book but, she is neither beautiful on the outside or the inside!! A very spiteful and unhappy woman. What a lonely life she must have. I didn't even finish the book because I couldn't take anymore of this self-absorbed (even with her children) nonsense!! Not worth a dime!"
1,Oh dear,"I've read many books which I would describe as unputdownable. Unfortunately, after just the second chapter this one became unpickupable.I didn't know what to expect, but the blurb suggested there might be something interesting or funny to make the read worthwhile. Indeed there might be, but now I'll never know. Ho hum."
1,Verrrry appropriate titile,"I got this book on my Kindle because it was free. I like autobiographies because I like getting to know the REAL person behind the character(s) he/she plays. Unfortunately, in this case I found I ended up NOT liking the real person. The real Cybill's moral compass is broken (nay, shattered), her mirror is magical (i.e.""mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all? Cybill is!""), and her self-absorption is through the roof.I'm amazed at the number of men she slept with; married/unmarried not a factor. Naming some of the more well-known only seemed to titillate her, while it saddened me. I was embarrassed for her, ashamed of her, and disgusted by her.I am always sorry when I admire a character only to lose respect when I find out what he/she is really like. In some cases, it would be better if they stayed 'in character', when the character is better than they.Oh, and on top of all that, I never thought she was especially pretty."
2,"You have to be a big fan, to find all of this interesting.","Some interesting comments about show business, and about some of the people she worked with, and went to bed with. The last part, about her TV show, ""Cybill,"" would only interest a BIG fan of the show. (Who did what and who said what about the show's individual episodes isn't exactly gripping reading.) (I'm glad it's a short book.)"
2,Didn't care for this book at all,Within the first 10-15 pages this book just seemed to be another washed up Hollywood celebrity whining about how good they were when they were at the peak of their stardom. I guess it was just too whiny of oh poor me I got older and wasn't good enough for the camera anymore kind of thing or something. I just didn't care for it at all.
1,What a disappointment,"First, let me say, I grew up when Cybill Shepherd was a model but could never figure out why she was on the cover of magazines. Let me also say, I liked the TV shows Moonlighting and Cybill, not because of her, but because of the good writing and support cast. This book was written so badly, she should be embarrassed it was published. And so many typos. 30 Rock was written (on the Kindle) as 3rd Rock. I didn't read it all the way through because I lost interest. I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy. Her ego is huge. All her failures were always everyone elses fault. The few times she had a good run in her career is because she was sleeping with the right men. I grew up during the sexual revolution, too, but was turned off by her attitude about sleeping with married men without any guilt. By the way: I'm glad it was free on Kindle or I would have felt ripped off."
2,too whiney,Didn't even finish this book... I couldn't get past the whining about how awful her life was and the people she didn't like or didn't treat her right. Maybe I will try again later. Some of the other reviews talk about the humor. I didn't see it in the first few chapters... maybe it comes later.
3,Cybill Disobedience,"I have not ever really been a big fan of Cybill Shepherd and after reading this book, I now know why. She's a blowhard and, dare I say it, even more of a bitch than I thought she was. I do know that this is an autobiography but she talks down to the reader as I have never experienced before.I consider myself to be fairly well read, but thank God Kindle has a built-in dictionary! I was having to look up just about every other word that she wrote! She went to college and received a degree but that doesn't give her license to write as if the rest of us are idiots.If you don't mind looking up every other word she writes, then enjoy reading this tell about this conceited actress!"
4,You have to be a fan......,"To really enjoy this book, you have to be a fan of Cybill Shepherd. Just to read it for the gossip is not enough. I've always enjoyed watching her in her various projects. This book just tells her side, true, but it it written in an honest and no holds barred way, warts and all. If you are interested in a book about a lady who has done a lot of living, and somehow come thru it, this is it."
4,A honest assessment ...,"...of the life of a strong woman in unique circumstances. She is forthcoming about all, owning her strength and foibles both equally and with humor."
3,"just being civil...i mean,cybill","i notice a lot of readers do not like this book. i thought it was,ok. cybill talks about many,many things:her childhood,teen years,romances,movies,relationships,pregancies,oh,sooooooooooooooooooo many things.honestly,as i began reading the first few pages,i thought is this cybill talking or a squirrel on caffeine???the narrative sort of goes in many directions and the reader must pay attention! on the downside,cybill doesdrop LODES of names and annecdotes about hollywood people and sometimes she does seem bitchy but,to be fair tocybill,i do think she is being honest and is not hiding behind any mask and i would like to remindreaders,cybill WAS in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW AND TAXI DRIVER. this does give her some right to dish some dirt.i say,read it with an open mind and don't be so hard to knock down cybill...also,she did put some nice photos intothree sections of the book!!!"
1,Don't waste your time,Boring is the only word that can describe this book. When I was reading I kept thinking it will get better. The chapters are long and drawn out with detail that has no point. It never got any better. So don't waste your time.
2,Cybill Disobedience,"I couldn't get past her lifestyle, which thoroughly disgusted me. She is totally self absorbed and then tried to place the blame on almost everybody she ever knew for their inability to get along with her. I guess her style of writing was OK, though."
1,Trashy,"Trashy, self-indulgent biography; avoid at all costs, unless you like trashy, self-indulgent biographies. And one point I would like to make . . . I got this when it was free on kindle, cause I sure wouldn't have paid for it!"
3,"Cybill would like your attention, please!","Love her or hate her... Cybill apparently doesn't care, as she lets it all hang out in this memoir. I admire her frankness while being put off by her total self-absorption. I'm pretty sure she earned that rep for being hard to work with.This is your basic guilty pleasure trashy read, quick and dirty. If you got it free on Kindle, as I did, more power to ya."
3,It wasn't my fault,"I read this book because I enjoyed the 'Cybill' TV show and admire Cybill Sheppard's independent attitude.The co-author, Aimee Lee Ball, should be complimented on the structure and flow, it is notable.Cybill's content isn't. Each negative situation sends the message 'it wasn't my fault.' Gets tiresome.She spends the first part of the book making sure you understand she is well read and an intellectual.Sex is a constant topic. But sex takes it's place along side of lunch as an event of the day. Sure takes the fun out of it for the reader.But, I still look forward to the next Cybill Sheppard TV Show, Special or Movie. Just call me a fan."
2,Is there anyone in Hollywood she hasn't slept with?,"Cybill Disobedience was mildly entertaining. If you are a fan, as I was, you will enjoy it more than someone who just knows Cybill's name. But Cybill comes off as shallow and preoccupied with sex. Actually, this is more of a sex diary than an autobiography. Did I really need to know that Elvis didn't want to ""go there""?"
1,Big mistake to download.,"Unless you are a HUGE fan of hers, I wouldn't waste time downloading this book. It is perhaps one of the most narcissistic biographies I have read in a long time. I grew up with Moonlighting and loved the show, which was the biggest reason I got the Kindle book. I figured it would be entertaining. It wasn't. I just couldn't finish it, Cybill Shephard may not be aware of how revolting she made herself look in this book. No morals, no compassion, no care for anyone but herself. I honestly couldn't wait to delete it of my Kindle and Kindle library."
1,No respect,"I used to really admire Cybil. After reading her book I lost a lot of respect for her. Actually I started losing interest when I saw an article back in the eighties in People Magazine with her then new boyfriend, Stuntman, Wally Crowden or something like that. The guy was too low class for her, at least the image I had of her. But after I finished the book I came to realize that maybe they had a lot in common after all. I thought her sexual appetite ... was better left in the bedroom than on the written page for the world to read. ... To degrade yourself for the sake of selling books is, well, I do hope she finds herself before it's too late. Beauty fades, and what you have left you need to live with and LIKE."
5,Beautiful Towel Bar,"Am very happy with the Franciscan Collection 18"" Towel Bar in Polished Chrome. Adds that extra feeling of glamour in my master bath."
4,Fun Yet Sometimes Tedious,"Pirates of The Caribbean: At World's End is a fun game and has probably the best swordplay of any game currently on the market. It is at times a fast paced game (but other times very slow going) and the graphics are above par for a PSP Game. The three main stars of the film provide the voices for their characters, which is a hoot. However, the game does tend to get tedious on some levels as you basically have to repeat the same mission over and over (sorta like Star Wars: Battlefront 2) and it's not always the easiest game. Overall though the game is a pleasurable enough time killer and is on par with Pirates of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest."
3,"Hard game, good graphics","I purchased for my 7 yr old son, but like the game as well. It's too hard for either of us. I can't get past the woman with the bat. He can get past her, but has a hard time with the other levels, he just ends up playing his star wars game and this one sits in the case. Not a game for rookies, but it is fun."
4,Excellent Reference for the Skilled Fighter,This is an excellent reference for fighters that are looking to become their best! I found it easy tounderstand and definitely easy to apply to one's fighting style. The 7 keys to fighting speed detailedwith this book are easy to learn and use. Each key is explained and laid out with tips on how to work theminto your style.This is definitely not for beginners but it will help those that are already adept fighters improve upontheir knowledge! This is most certainly a must read!
5,Exellent Resource!,"Speed Training for Martial ArtsJ. BarnesIn this book, Mr. J. Barnes clearly explains how to overcome common mental barriers and improve your speed and efficiency.In several exercises of varying difficulty, Barnes' book will help you in countless areas.The book is easy reading and doesn't bore you with useless mumbo-jumbo.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone involved or considering being involved in martial arts of any kind."
4,Not For Beginners,"Apparently, I didn't read the book synopsis correctly. I was in a hurry and added this to my Kindle before I realized that it was not how to speedily learn martial arts. :) My bad...But I read it anyway and can't wait for my family to start our foray into learning the martial arts. This book created an excitement in us. And stirred the competitive spirit in this momma! I promise to go easy on the three year old though!Seriously, I asked a friend with years of experience competing in the martial arts to take a look before I posted my review and she thought the book was great. Its easy to read, practical, and of course, motivational.Best suited for more advanced martial artists (in my opinion), this would make a nice gift or additional to your personal library."
2,Decent but not earthshattering,"This book had a few good ideas for speed training drills, but was very simplistic. I wouldn't recommend it to a experienced practitioner, but might be OK for a novice or beginner."
4,"Easy to Understand, Lots of Information","Barnes is a very knowledgeable author. I was very impressed by his book ""Speed Training for Martial Arts"" Martial Arts is an art that I find very interesting but it always seems so complex. Self discipline, speed and how to handle an attacker are all the topics I was interested in learning about. Most books contain very complex information, in a language that I am not familar with. This author is onbviously very very knowledgeable but he realizes that his readers are searching for different levels of information. The novice to the expert will all take away a lot from this very educational book."
1,Seriously Worthless,"The author has speed training activities like saying ""ugh"" as soon as you see a green light while waiting in traffic or pulling toys away from your pets as his speed drills.The book is about 20 pages long, tagged at 9.99 on Kindle, I doubt it's actually published by anyone. It's hardly longer than a pamphlet. Here is an excerpt:""Traffic LightWhile driving or riding in a vehicle, you can work on your anticipation skills by reacting when the traffic light changes from red to green. You can respond with a light ""ugh"" when the light changes. Do not try to anticipate the green light. Just react. Race care drivers use this drill to develop anticipation skill.Caution: do not react by slamming the gas pedal to the floor. Use an appropriate and safe response to avoid injuring anyone.""Seriously...the book is full of that kind of useless garbage.I have 107 Kindle purchases, I'm going to seek a refund on this one, first time ever."
2,late out of stock and refunded,it was late out of stock and refunded but they did try to look for replacement which i appreciate.
5,you wanted the best...you got the best!,"When the Amazing (Royal) Crowns are on...they're ON. These four Providence greasers are one of the most on-fire live bands you'll come across, and their studio recordings aren't too shabby neither! This wicked live set is pieced together from the three nights of their most recent Providence Payback shows. From the monster truck rally/rasslin' announcer intro to the final explosion of guitars, bass, and drums, you'll think yr sweatin' and screamin' along with 'em in the flesh. It's hard to capture the Crowns' live intensity on disc, but this comes damn close. It's got all the favorites, like ""Do The Devil,"" some new tracks from ""Royal"" and their vicious takes on The Misfits' ""American Nightmare"" and Agent Orange's ""Bloodstains."" This is a must-have for any Crowns fan, rockabilly fan, or anyone who appreciates good, honest, real rock n' roll."
4,Take Some Home,"Faster than studio. Does a great job of capturing the live energy of Crowns' shows. Sound quality is a little weak on the bass end and a little too strong in the mid range (typical for live recordings). If you like any of their albums, you need this one too."
2,Discontinued color! and they clog,"All the sink fixtures in my condo are Grohe based on their rep for quality. The master bath is in polished brass. One of my soap pumps (this design) clogged and jammed and Grohe had no PB to send as they discontinued the color. They sent me a chrome one to try to salvage parts from. I went searching and eventually found that Amazon had 3 left and was selling at a reasonable price. Many who have it wanted way over $100 for them. I was ready to replace with a different brand when I found these at Amazon. They do have a tendency to clog so you need to maintain them by cleaning the periodically. If you're starting from scratch, choose a different brand."
5,BEST CHRISTMAS GIFT I GOT THIS YEAR,"I recieved this wonderful book as a gift on Christmas Eve. I sat down that evening after the kids were nestled into bed and started reading it. I could not put it down!! I just finished it and I must say I have read the DaVinci Code and many other ""best sellers"" but this book is by far the best book I have read in a long, long time. It may just be the best. It should be on everyones must read list!!! I know I will be giving Sacred Ashes as a gift very soon."
5,A stirring and thought-provoking novel!,"In today's rather self-absorbed world where our focus very often tends to be on things far removed from our hearts, this book offers an encouraging perspective on how deeply human we are and where true happiness and fulfillment really dwell. The author has given us a thrilling story that touches upon the eternal struggle between the attributes of modern technology and the ethical considerations that will continually need to be addressed as well. 'Sacred Ashes' will open your heart, refresh your soul, and quite possibly, renew your faith in mankind and all that we are meant to be. I promise that you will be pondering the events disclosed in this novel long after you have finished the book!"
5,Beginning,This very good for those who want to really swing & swing again and again without banging up their knees or head or breaking something it works great
5,Attention Rachael Robbins and Tina Krause fans!!,"If you're a fan of Racheal (THE SCREAMING DEAD) Robbins or Tina Krause, I have three words for you. . .FULL FRONTAL NUDITY. 'Cause basically, this movie is FULL of constant nude scenes with Robbins and Krause. Oh yeah, it's got that guy from MANIAC COP in it, too!"
4,Remember from childhood!,"I've been looking for this movie forever! Why no DVD? I believe this movie involves a family keeping a ""Wild Child"" locked in an attic room behind a red door? I also seem to remember a windmill.I also believe the wild child makes many a killin'!"
1,Piece of cr*p,"I thought from all the reviews that this would be a quality piece of equipment. How wrong I was! All of the critical joints are made of plastic. My last stand had one critical joint made of plastic and the first time it fell over with a book on it the plastic broke. This one? Will be sending it back tomorrow. If you are looking for a cheaply made disposable stand then this one would do. If you are looking for a ""professional"" stand like this one claims to be, then keep on looking. This stand is a cheaply made piece of cr*p;."
1,NOT A Very GOOD PRODUCT,Got the stands in put them together set them leaning on the edge of the couch in my living room one slid down off the other and it broke right at the head of the stand and now it is junk don't by the product if you are going to use it on the road it will never last!!!!!!!!!!! [...]
5,good stand,"good heavy duty stand... better than ones in the schools.fully adjustableheavyoversized tray, good for books, music folder etc.adequate sit down, or stand up height"
1,Design of clamps needs review,"After assembly, the (2) plastic clamps that allow up or down adjustment, do not get tight enough to prevent the stand from colapsing with a binder of music on the shelf."
5,increadible quality!,"Although I noticed the price has gone up about $10 since I bought this stand, it's still an incredible bargain at $40. The quality build of the stand cannot be beat. I would expect to easily pay twice as much."
5,Great value,"Very high quality, worth a few extra bucks. Can hold a large book of sheet music easily. Very glad I didn't go cheap on buying a stand."
5,Very nice adjustable music stand for the price,"On Stage makes some very nice products. This music stand has all the adjustments as one of our favorite older units. Well made and the price doesn't put it out of range for the everyday musician. Really am liking On Stage products, also bought 2 of their boom mic stands and they are excellent."
4,Music Stand,"If your looking for a sturdy yet portable music stand that can, handle a 2"" notebook of music and still remain stable, then this is the stand for you. I love it's portability that does not sacrifice anything in quality of material or workmanship. An excellent buy."
1,Did not stand up,I am so disappointed. This is the second of this stand I bought in 2 years. Both times the adjustment knob just stopped working and slid all the way down.I have a voice studio so here was little wear. Not moved around or taken apart or adjusted.
1,Almost wonderful,"The stand is very sturdy and looks great, but the podium is held to the vertical stand with a plastic bracket. The bracket broke during assembly. I never even got to put a sheet of music on the damn thing.I didn't want to go to the hassle of packing everything back up to mail for a return, so I made my own metal bracket. Now the stand is wonderful. It's too bad that they couldn't have made it more robust in the begining."
5,VERY solid stand,"This is a fantastic music stand. It's very solid, not flimsy at all. Has a good weight to it without being to heavy. Holds a lot and is very durable. So durable that my husband decided to use it as a snow shovel during the last snow storm(without my prior knowledge or permission mind you - he got caught in the act). I probably could have beat him over the head and burried him with it - like a shovel (I didn't). In any case, the stand is unharmed (so is my husband) and in spite of that incident, still looks like new. I'm impressed. :)"
5,Totally Satisfied,I was so tired of setting music books on a chair or a desk to play my guitar at home. I decided I needed to upgrade and be more comfortable. I found this music stand and most all the reviews were very positive. The main negative I found was in the shipping of the item and the condition when received. My stand arrived yesterday packed not only in its original packaging but in a bigger box from Amazon. It was in perfect condition when I opened both boxes. I set up the stand about 10 minutes ago and it took me all of 2 minutes or less to put it together. I am so satisfied. My first thought was how can they sell an item like this for this price and free shipping. I am pleased with its sturdiness and heaviness. I kind of expected it to be very light and possibly unsteady on carpet but it is just fine. I'm glad I found this and my back feels better already realizing I can sit back now and play.
5,Excellent!!,"I have eight year old twin boys who are in their first year in violin. I needed something sturdy that would not be easily knocked or tipped over and this stand is perfect. The legs spread to increase stability, it is heavy and solid. The plastic knobs are fine, I don't see why anyone would need to tighten them to a point where they would break--I only mention them because these were an issue in another review. Not only do I not have to worry about my twins but this stand is also safe from our toddler and 200lb puppy mastiff. I really can't believe the quality at this price."
4,Use with care,"The metal tube is very solid, yet the plastic connection look fragile. I don't have a 500-page binder to throw on it. So it is working fine so far for me. Every time I adjust it, I am careful not to over tighten it. Otherwise it was great for the price."
5,Built to last,"It was a gift for my Father, who is a musician. He liked it very much. It is extremely study and it is hard to tip over, unlike his previous stand, which would fall over easily and dump his music all over. It is wide enough so that he can have several music books open at a time. He is enjoying it a lot."
3,One star less for poor packaging,"This is a good stand for the price. Easy to assemble. Unfortunately they shipped it in the retail box without any additional packaging. It arrived bent, but functional. Maybe I should have sent it back, but I didn't want to take the time since it was still usable."
1,Plastic thing broke before we got the stand put together!,"I figured so many people liked this stand that I would ignore the one review that talked about the plastic part breaking... Well, that is exactly what happened to us. Man I feel stupid! Now I have to figure out how to return the thing. Plastic part doesn't fit over the metal pole making it impossible to assemble without breaking the plastic!"
1,Watch out for this STAND!,"I love this music stand, but it didn't last. The plastic piece snapped off after less than 6 months and now all the other moving parts work well, but no plastic piece."
1,"Not Impressed, plastic crack upon first use.","I'm not happy with this stand. I should have bought another brand, after putting it together once, the plastic cracked."
5,Great music stand - relatively light weight and very stable,"This is a great music stand. Relatively light weight and very stable, it is used by my daughter almost every day."
5,Just what we needed,A great portable stand for the price! A great tool to have for our praise & worship team at church.
4,good stand,"A solid stand. holds good amount of music sheets, easy for a ten years old to use. good product for the price."
4,good stand,"This has the largest top of any of my stands, and it is the one I use when traveling / gigs. The top doesn't fold like some of the more expensive Stagg Hercules stands, so if you're using it for gigging, that may be something to consider. I have to lug an 88key weighted piano around, so don't mind lugging this."
5,Excellent music stand,"The On-Stage SM7211 is an excellent music stand, especially for the price. The stand arrived very quickly, and there was essentially no assembly. The quality is high, and the piece is built very well. Much more than I expected for the price."
5,Great stand,Could not be happier with this stand. Sturdy and well built. Base folds for travel. A great stand for the price. Highly recommend.
5,Surprising little stand,"I bought this for my young daughter for her violin practice and it has withstood the abuse of both her and her little sister who have dressed it up and moved it around the house like a pet. I also used it to hold up papers at a school presentation and to hold materials at a PTA talk - all within weeks of buying it. It doesn't fall over, like many other music stands, and is easily transported because it is collapsible. My mother-in-law has also used it as a coat rack and it keeps purses off the floor during playdates. On the whole, it has been a surprisingly useful piece of furniture. I'd recommend it to anyone."
2,Not as sturdy as I thought,"This stand worked great for about a year, but then it started breaking down. The screws that held it together don't tighten all the way anymore, and the part that holds the leg to the center base completely came off. I'll be buying the proline music stand for my next one.Also, There is a lip at the top of the onstage stand that might prevent a standlight from being attached"
3,Sturdy enough - does the job.,"Generally satisfied with the build quality vs the price. Works best for me when using a notebook containing all my charts. I also use it for holding plain 8.5x11 sheets of paper and that's where some improvements would be welcome. The rivits holding the back to the pedastal with catch the paper if sliding it down onto the stand (minor issue) - but worse, a plain sheet of paper will often slip off the front due to the smoothness of the bottom shelf part - there's nothing to hold the bottom edge from sliding forward and rolling off the stand. I might just remedy this shortcoming with some textured tape or something. Still, I would recommend the stand."
5,A stand that is not just for music!,"While this is no doubt a great music stand, it is also a great book stand that I use along side my computer desk. I needed something that would hold books and the ability to adjust the height. This stand works perfectly. If you have limited desk space and need something to hold copy or books, consider this stand. You won't be sorry."
5,You need this stand,"I got this stand mainly because, at the time I purchased it, it seemed very reasonably priced, so it was a happy surprise that it turned out to be an excellent piece of equipment as well as easy on the pockets.I'm a beginning adult classical guitar student who usually practices in my living room. My very, very dimly lit living room.This very sturdy, steady, easily assembled, and highly adjustable music stand, (along with a music stand light) has saved not only my eyes, but my posture as well. No more contorting myself out of the correct playing position just so I could see sheets more clearly.I couldn't speak about it on a professional level, but as a practical tool for students and hobbyists, you could absolutely do worse than this stand, but you probably won't be able to do much better. Thumbs up."
2,more orange than red,"these light up an orangey red, not a deep red like i had hoped.. this is nothing like a red LED, so just buyer beware, your buying orange cathodes not red ones"
5,Works wonderfully!,These cathodes are very bright and look great in my system. Installation was simple and only took me about 10 minutes.
5,These are red!!,"Well built... throw the double sided tape away, and use a bread tie or zip tie. Well worth the price!"
2,Should/could be much better,"First - Track 9, labeled ""Martern aller Arten"" - Konstanze's towering aria from Mozart's DIE ENTFUHRUNG AUS DEM SERAIL is actually her earlier Act 1 aria ""Ach Ich Liebte, War So Gucklich"". This for me is a major infraction - somewhat like replacing your Rolex Oyster with a Timex Indiglo (unfair - but you get the idea).Second - Most of the selections here are played too slow, and without the expected swagger or soul. If you want trumpet playing classical music, try Doc Severinsen's TRUMPET SPECTECULAR (with Erich Kunzel conducting the Cincinnati Pops) which has only a couple opera tracks, but one of them is an absolutely [great] version of 'Largo al factotum' from Rossini's Barber of Seville."
4,Awesome Product,"I love my new rug! The colors, quality and style are exactly what I was looking for when I ordered it on-line."
5,What a bargin,The rug is great. It is decent quality and the colors are great. Hard to believe its only $99. I'm thinking of buying another one.
4,Works great,"This got the job done. It is closer to clean room tape than a painters masking tape. It is plastic (poly), not paper based."
3,Disappointed,"When I got this staff I was expecting the sections to combine into a full staff, the staff does not do that. I was led to believe this because the product features section it states ""It is able to collapse into a short baton or expand into a long spinning staff."" Other than this the product does everything it promises, I highly recommend it if you simply want a three sectional staff."
1,this game was discontinued,thq stopped production on this game a while back....i was looking forward to it....but it got cancelled :(
4,"We need more ""un-lost"" tapes!","Of course this DVD was excellent! Any time we get to see unseen footage of Jackass the series or JA1 or JA2 is totally welcomed! I just wish they'd make the 3rd film. I know it's probably not going to be made, but we hard core fans can only hope!"
4,Should have been on the boxed set,"Luckily my local retailer shelved this item a week early so I already have it.The stunts and clips on this are really some of the best the show had to offer and it was nothing short of tragic that they were left off of the boxed set. I am of the opinion that the boxed set was really poorly done in that it should have been episodic rather than just 3 conglomerations of edited down stunts and skits.That being said I am really glad that some of these gems are finally on DVD. The original ""Satan vs. God"" is presented in all its uncensored (read unbleeped) glory. Knoxville breaking his ankle trying to jump the ""LA river"" on rollerskates is included and uncensored. ""Self Defense Test"" ""Milk Challenge"". All are slices of fried gold. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars from me is that this material should have been released on the boxed set.Bottom line is if you are a fan This is an absolute MUST have to complete the series."
5,The LOST Tapes?,"Well, I want to start by saying this little DVD is so funny. It has over 2 hours of Jackass skits not released on the box sets. That is unfortunate. Basically, these should be called the Unreleased Tapes.One complaint: the original version of the Self Defense skit had Knoxville putting on a bulletproof vest and shooting himself. Why is that not here?"
5,Happy,"Had my son on it from maney years ago . Love it. Did not like all the poo stuff I had to get through , But worth it to see my boy."
4,<3,these tapes were definitely never lost. Ive seen a lot of these skits on the show. But of course its better to have the physical copy because its not censored and its a must have for jackass fans wishing to complete their collection
4,More great tongue in cheek fun,"I love 60's spy stuff. So far out, so tongue in cheek, so funny. And David McCallum is simply delicious with the long hair. Ask any woman over 35 about Illya Kuryakin and watch her face. MMM MMM good. I wish Turner/MGM would do all 4 seasons of these on DVD. I'd buy em all again!"
2,Started out okay but diminished in time,"I like the shape and look of this and it could be great for candle lighting but there are problems. The starter is uncomfortably hard to push. I understand that it's for child protection, but it's working against adults too. Also, the butane fill end is small, too small for a normal adapter on a can of standard zippo butane, this is not good. Rendered unfillable. Soo sad! :-("
1,"Great selection, weak performance","I agree with other reviewers that this ""best of"" selection is a great intro to Satie, a composer I believe deserves wide recognition. But there are much better performances on other ""best of"" Satie collections. For me Klara doesn't cut it - awkward, unfelt, stiff, poorly recorded. I'm no prude, but I was disappointed enough to delete this download and try Roland Pontinen's Satie collection instead. Skip this one and audition other performers; find your own favorite. Listen to how each player handles Gymnopedies, for example. There must be a dozen different versions on amazon alone, each with its own recording ambiance, tempo, feel. I'll bet you'll find a better version too. Satie deserves it, and so do you."
3,too many mistakes,"This book has some good information, but it's obvious that they skipped all the steps needed to locate the errors. It's supposed to have the correct answers for test questions. However, multiple times up to chapter 7, I'm finding that the answer key is off, obviously off by getting the numbers mixed up and so on. This book can still be helpful, but it's very disappointing to find this many errors after paying good money for the book. I'd consider going to other publishers before buying again from these people."
3,Good for advanced & experienced candidates,"This book does include all the highlights on each section. However, the layout could be improved for readability. There's an error on the questions and answers arrangement. Overall, I like the in-depth answers to all the questions, help readers to analyze questions in MS way. It's great to review this book prior to your exam for consolidation."
2,Its not the best vampire animes out there,"This is one of those animes that you watch once and hope never to see it again.Story: There isn't much of a story to it. Not exciting, dull, and the ending is completely stupid.Characters: Main character is lame. Why would you make the main character a clumsy fool. There is not one character that is likable in this story.Animation: The only thing this anime has for it is the graphics.I wouldn't recommend it.If you want vampire action: see Vampire Hunter D, Hellsing, Blood: the last vampire and the Blood + series (only sub-titled at the moment or cartoon network Midnight on Saturdays)"
3,For someone else,"This cd purchase was actually a request from a family member, so it is not something I've actually had the chance to listen to. Thus, I only gave it 3 stars."
3,Boomming gun duels,"Another trip down memory lane, feet tapping, sing - a - long marching and yarwhooing to the defeat of the enemy. Or crying over the pain of the lost cause."
5,Johnny Horton,Great music. I have not heard these songs since I was a kid. I would recommend to anyone who loves vintage country music.
1,Price change?,"People keep saying this is $45. I'm seeing a price of $68. I can get a one year card for $46, why would I pay $22 for one ""free"" month? That makes no sense. If I'm missing something, please point it out and I will change the number of stars."
4,Xbox Live,"I got this because it was a few dollars cheaper than what it normally costs but what can I say? It's Xbox Live, although I do wish it was cheaper."
3,There are other options than buying this card,"For anyone who has an xbox 360 the question isn't ""if"" you are going to connect to xbox live but when you do, how will you pay for the subscription? This is a good option and I prefer it to buying a subscription online, but it isn't the only option.Xbox 360 Live Camera BundleI recommend going with the camera bundle option currently. It gives you a 12 month membership to xbox live but also comes with the vision camera, two xbox live arcade games, a headset, and 200 Microsoft Points for not much more. I only paid $65 for the camera package and for what you get it makes the subscription by itself seem overpriced."
2,"good price, clunky service","Great place to buy an Xbox Live Gold subscription. Pre-paid is especially nice as it avoids MS getting ahold of your credit card for automatic repeat billing. Unfortunately, Xbox Live is not the most amazing service in the world: Wii and PS3 are much more functional. Opponent matching is quite slow. You can't play against opponents on other platforms. Your achievements are permanently tied to your Gamertag and e-mail address. Your e-mail address cannot be changed without a support call. Entering information and navigation while shopping for purchases or games online is extremely difficult using the Xbox controller. Although Xbox Live has a great web page, they don't use it to solve this usability problem."
5,Good Buy :),"If you have xbox 360, you're missing out if you don't have xbox live. Most games have it where you can play against other people online through xbox live. [...]."
2,Non transferrable- Non Refundable,"We made a mistake when setting up my son's XBox Live Gold account that we paid for with this card. We noticed the problem the first day of the account and contacted XBOX.com. Our only recourse was to cancel this account and open a new one. If we had paid with a credit card this would have been possible, but since the live card is non refundable and non transferrable this was not possible. So now we either have to live with the problems of the account or lose the money and pay for a new one."
2,Shipping times are unacceptable,"While the price is definitely right, and playing games online a blast, the shipping times for this products are absurd. It was supposed to ship on Jan. 23, then got moved back to Jan. 26, and now they're saying Feb. 2nd. For something the size of a credit card that is plentifully in stock?! Totally, 100%, without-a-doubt ridiculous and insulting to me as a customer. It will most definitely make me weary of buying from Amazon itself (not a vendor on Amazon) in the future."
3,Why the subscription fee?,"Xbox Live is necessary for the 360 since the system is solely an online only system. I have tried the single player and you can tell developers are slacking on that element of the gameplay.Only real draw back is you pay $50 for the service, but you have to turn around and buy Microsoft Points for downloads. Drop $60 on Oblivion. Then drop another $60 on Microsoft Points for the rest of the content.This sadly is going to be a growing trend. You will pay more for the games, but have more and more of the content be put up as marketplace downloads for an additional fee. Don't like it. Especially with the low quality of most of todays games, and the high price tags that go with them.Time for Microsoft to think of the gamers instead of making money. I'll glady sacrifice the gamerscore (rather useless feature anyways), and my universal gamertag for some free content and free online play."
1,Typical Microsoft Support,"Yes, typical Microsoft support, as it is on everything they do. I had the same problem, where the activation code wore off when I scratched off the rubber coating. I tried to get assistance from XBOX as well as Microsoft, and several employees admitted this is a big problem that is happening a lot, but Microsoft says 'too bad' - if you can't read the code then there is no way to verify it, so bend over and take it. I am filing a grievance with my state's Attorney General, and I advise others to do the same. Most states Attorney Generals have websites where such complaints can be filed. Let's use Microsoft's internet against them and see how they like it."
5,XBox Live is awesome!!!!!,"This product is really awesome!!! Activating the code of XBox Live is really easy, and you don't have to make a big effort to find friends online. I have used it to play Halo 3 on multiplayer mode, and I have passed a lot of hours playing it."
1,Horrible,"First 5 digits of code scratched off when I removed the coating with a coin. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. The seller nor Microsoft would replace it, and I had to eat the $42. Microsoft live charges $45 to sign up for XBOX live through the console, so go that route."
3,Insult to injury,"PROPrice is awesomeOk, this is simple. You need this to play xbox live games with you friends, co-workers or any fool who challenges you. Its so addicting im willing to pay for it.I use it mainly for Halo 3, COD4, Bad Company, Rockband DLCCON: Shipping UGH*7-10 Business days OUCH!!! They mean it, USPS ,Yep Postal Service!!!If I could call and have the code read to me over the phone I would choose this option.I placed the order Sept 10th, (still not here took 3 whole days to move across town to springfield MA, if i knew i would have done a detour from Six flags there....)it is set to arrive Sept 22ndits also a dollar cheaper adding insult to injury, yes Whah...I need a whambulance!!!!"
1,wut a rip,"i received this card a couple of days ago and to activate you have to scratch off a bar code like thing to access the code underneath, so i did and also scratched off the code. What this means is that just paid 50 bucks for a valueless piece off plastic. xbox is a joke when i contact customer support they say ""[duhhh] you shouldn't have scratched so hard"". At this point im planning on sticking with the ps3 for online play which doesn't set me back 50 dollars(enough to buy a new game)."
1,useless card,my son used a coin to scratch the card and scratched off the code as well. microsoft support is useless in helping to recover the code and now we will see if amazon will replace the card.
1,Why do I have to pay for this?,"Xbox Live is basically Microsoft's online store for Xbox products, games, and movies. That being said I have paid $300 for an Xbox, $50 a month for internet access and the USB input doesn't accept wireless router connections so another $50 for wireless connection in order to pay $50 a year for a shopping website membership? Why? Everything on Xbox Live costs money except for basic chat functions. Even downloading user created games costs money. Even if you have netflix and are paying a subscription for that you must also pay a monthly subscription to xbox to stream the movies via your OWN internet connection. Where is the justification?You may argue that World of Warcraft and other online gaming communities charge monthly fees, but at least you know your money is going to continued game development, etc. and you KNOW what it is going to cost you to play upfront."
1,Be prepared to hate your life,"I have been using XBOX Live for 11 months. Online play usually works, but often lags and drops. I do not have similar problems on comparable PC games, so I doubt this is an issue with MY ISP. Since games are usually hosted by other XBOXs, your results will vary with every session. I recently tried using a friend's console with my profile. I had to enter all my information twice because it timed out... not that big a deal. However, when I got home I was prompted to recover my profile online. So I entered my info... timed out. I entered it again... timed out. (Each time requiring the gamertag, email address and password. I repeated this 7 times and was unable to recover the profile. So I was unable to load any saved games for any games (to play locally or online). It has been three days now and I have tried to recover my profile countless times and still can't load any save games. I called XBOX support and their only suggestions was to.... keep trying."
5,"Good price, great product!!",If you don't mind waiting for a few days (shipping) then this is a way better deal than buying a membership from the XBOX LIVE marketplace. [......]
4,A Must Have,"If you're playing some of the best Xbox 360 games, it most likely has multiplayer, which means it can be played online. You need to be a gold member if you want to play online, and so you pretty much need this if you want to fully enjoy your game."
5,Fun and easy,"Excellent item, very easy to install. Peel the sticket and enter the code it's that easy."
3,"Easy, Cheap, Quick","Since I used the Super Saver option, my shipping was free and I paid about ten dollars less than in-store. Be aware though when using Super Saver Shipping that your item will not be shipped right away. The delivery is quick but the actual shipping may not occur until a couple of days after you confirm your order. So, if you need it the next day, you may have to splurge on the shipping."
4,Good buy!,"Xbox 360 without Live is like skiing on a concrete hill. Sure, it's doable, but you're missing out on all the fun.Got a great price on a 13 month card. Constant free ""exclusive"" demos, discounts, community game days/tournaments/prize giveaways, game days with developers/celebrities, netflix movies streaming straight to your XBox, multiplayer, leaderboards, added achievements, downloadable content, and micro games for sale cheap.Games now are being developed with Live 100% in mind, you'd be crazy to cripple you enjoyment of your system for less then $4 a month."
5,Exactly as advertised.,"I dont trust MS with my credit card, and this is the cheapest way to get live."
5,A Must Have,This is definitely a must-have for all Xbox 360 owners. I have been on Live for 3-4 years now and I love it more now than I ever have. You can play every game on there and online play doesn't get old like single player does after a while. [...].
5,Great Price!,When I bought my xbox 360 it came with a free 3 month xbox live subscription. That was due to expire so I needed to continue my xbox live subscription. This was a great price and now I don't have to worry about not being able to access all the great things going on with xbox live.
4,This has ruined my life.,"After ordering this online xbox card I waited 2-3 days patiently. Upon arrival I giddily activated my xbox live gold account with the information found on the back of the card. Simple enough right? Well, that when everything went down hill. I didn't stop playing Halo 3 online. Then I got playing other games like Gears of War and Rainbow Six Las Vegas. I go to work 8 hours a day and instead of socializing after work I immediately boot up the 360 and go to town on it. It is now all I do and I have no friends. It is all due to this product. Purchase if you don't already have friends or are looking to rid yourself of others."
5,Cheaper on Amazon,"On a whim, I decided to look on Amazon for this, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was a few dollars cheaper on Amazon. Granted, I would need to wait for it to arrive in the mail, but since Microsoft gives a one-month advance warning before one's Xbox Live membership expires, that was not an issue."
5,"Inexpensive, Netflix, Amazon Prime",Some of the negative reviews complain about scratching too hard and losing the code and therefore their money. Those reviews are for an older generation of this card; the one I got (11/2008) has a tear-off piece of paper to reveal the code. Entering the code online was a snap.I got the gold membership because it enhances my NetFlix subscription. The new Netflix/Xbox Gold feature lets users of both watch (most) Netflix instant streaming movies on their Xbox. The video quality has so far been excellent (even on the large screen); better than what I've seen on laptops. I'm looking forward to HD streaming but none of the 300 (so far) titles had any appeal to me.Update: Turns out Netflix allows unlimited streaming for most of its plans. Their $8.99 plan gives one DVD at a time and unlimited streaming via PC and/or XBox. Streaming experiences have so far been excellent.
3,A Xbox needs Live,"I believe Xbox Live is necessary to fully enjoy your Xbox. I personally think the code redemption cards are the best way to get Live, rather than giving Microsoft your credit card number. Free bonus month and they're usually discounted on Amazon. Live is awesome lets you play your games online and gives you access to many features that your Xbox wouldn't have without Live. I just wish it weren't so expensive."
5,What else would you expect?,"So you're looking at a 12+1 month Xbox Live subscription card on Amazon, and if it's still the same price as when I purchased it ($40), you might be a bit skeptical on the authenticity of this offer.I'm going to dispel that thought. With standard shipping, it arrived much sooner than I expected (wasn't more than 3 days), and it arrived in it's original plastic packaging. Just open it up, punch in the code on the card, and there's your 13 months of Xbox Live."
4,Streaming Netflix,"You might need to increase your Internet speed. But, if you have an Xbox 360 (I won mine by working overtime), then you go on an unlimited Netflix for $8.99 minimum, and you get streaming to your Hi-Def TV with this very best 13 month deal. I cancelled my Hi-Def cable and DVR, so I am spending way less, for way more. OH, I have no doubt that the prices will go up in the future, but right now this is such a deal. Many of you will go air digital and this Netflix. Road Warriors definitely want to do this Netflix bit. I am not doing any online XBox Gold gaming...I am not doing any Xbox Credits purchases. The entry level XBox Gold Live/Netflix Unlimited is absolutely the best value on the planet. I will never again buy a DVD."
5,Great price for Xbox Live service,"When I bought this item, it was $40 and it qualified for super-saver shipping. So, when you compare to the $50 you pay per 12 months via the Xbox 360 console using a credit card, this 12+1 month card is definitely the way to go. I've never found a cheaper price for this item anywhere."
1,Horrible!,"okay. Cats os a wonderful musical, as is Starlight Express. This CD, however, in no ways embodies either of these two fantastic shows. The music is badly remixed, and badly sung. It's only worth buying if you are familiar with these two shows, and want it for the humour value. It's so bad, it's funny!"
3,64 Controller,"The controller itself works well enough. The joystick in the middle isn't as responsive as it should be, but it can still play the game. Moreover, the memory card jack will not accept the card. The card was used on a different controller & works just fine. Overall, its suitable for the intended purpose."
3,I didn't order a side of syrup with my controller...,"The controller wasn't ""a bit"" dirty, it was completely filthy. The buttons were stuck in, there was marker on the controller, and it was as if someone laterally dipped the controller in syrup. I had to completely take this apart and clean the entire controller for it to be functioning and usable again.After cleaning it the controller was once again usable but it was in no way possible to use beforehand."
5,Awesome Yellow Controller,This Controller arrived today and I am extremely pleased. I am a 22-year-old Mario fan (about to turn 23). It arrived as described by the seller. The Joystick is tight and everything. My greatest thanks to the seller for his/her fast service. I had never had a Yellow Controller in the 16 years that the Nintendo 64 had been out. It's even the same color as Tweety Bird (Of the Looney Tunes).
5,Works just as well as original,"If you want to try different colors for your Nintendo 64 controllers, they work just as well as the original."
2,A watered-down game.,"First of all, let me say that this game is incredibly watered down. Bails feel unbelivably censored. Even the younger audience will become bored with this. The game has a control scheme like TONY HAWK 4, but isn't nearly as fun. Despite kids wanting a game with Disney characters, it isn't worth buying such a simple game. Even EVOLUTION SKATEBOARDING, from the same company, plays better than this. If you are buying this for a young child because they can't have a TEEN-RATED Tony Hawk game, give them KELLY SLATER'S PRO SURFER, or just have them wait until something else good comes out."
5,We love it.,"I don't want to rain on the parade, but every time we rent the thing we have a blast My 6 and 8 year olds have re-bonded, and they appreciate the Goofy wipe-out (""Hoo Hoo! Garsh!"" etc.) over the unrealistic, but nonetheless disturbing blood geysers of T.H. I'm buying it because I value family...."
4,Skateboarding is not bad at Disney!,"Disney Sports Skateboarding is a hot game. This game is basically just thrashing about beautiful over worlds while trying to scram checkpoints, bash obstacles, grind rails, pick-up emeralds, and finish all before time runs out! This mode also features ""New Skateboards"" that must be picked up by riding over! This game deserves better, I'm a weak skateboard player, so it's perfectly suited!!!"
3,Attractive but comes apart.,"I love the looks and it's functionality, but the pre-attached pieces are not well well put together, just extremely thin edges pre glued. My husband had to go out and find a special metal bondo to get them back together again. The lower rod, held together after assembly by simple pressure doesn't stay connected, since the part that attaches to the wall comes loose easily and wants to fall apart. I've hesitated to purchase a second rod."
2,Kansas - Off the Beaten Path,"The book is interesting, but seems to have a number of inaccuracies. i.e., the location of the Branding Iron Restaurant (p. 45), the military bridge, ""...one of only two remaining structures...""(p. 43)[the bridge was dismantled many years ago (maybe 20 years); ""Wealthy old Marblecrest Street .."" (p. 42), [I guess this is Marblecrest Drive; I would not call Marblecrest Drive wealthy or old]; the Battle of Mine Creek, ""...fought near Trading Post...""(p. 42) [Mine Creek Battlefield is several miles from Trading Post; it is about two miles from Pleasanton.]I find the book interesting, but with these inaccuracies in the areas with which I am familiar would cause me to be afraid to trust the book for areas in which I am not familiar."
5,Now's are brilliant. 16th april 2004.,"I have got now 53 and now 56, i love these cds because every time one comes out a new song that as also just come out comes on it. The music on them are ace there is abit of everything on them like kylie minogue,britney spears,blue etc and i could garantee that i would like it."
5,Great !,"Purchased online code for the boyfriend, had it within less than an hour. He's a very happy camper!Definitely purchasing online next year."
2,"Good Show, Poor Release","Episodes are out of order, there are no language or subtitle options.If you must have everything Code Lyoko, go ahead. If you are a casual fan or insist on perfection, don't bother."
5,Code Lyoko Season 1? YAY!,"This is an anime series about a group of boarding school friends who fight the evil, XANA, inside the ""super computer"". The show has both 2d and 3d like animation.For all of those who did not know this, Code Lyoko is a french show therefore the DVD is viewable in either English or French."
4,Never Lost Interest,"I'm tired of people saying thi is a ""Kid's Show"". I'm fifteen, and I still enjoy it and countless other Anime.I do not own the complete first season on DVD yet, but I'm counting on buying it. But there are a few things I wish to clear up.Japanese? Where did Amazon get Japanese? It's French. Code Lyoko originated from France and it was imported and voiced over to the US and various other countries. However, last time I checked, Japan was not one of them. I may be mistaken about it being imported to Japan, but I know the original DVDs and all had only two languages: English and French.The only reason I give Code Lyoko a 4-star rating is because the 2D animation can be a little... Strange, in a sense. But the 3D animation is amazing. I highly recommend Code Lyoko to people of ALL ages to enjoy."
5,A really good show,"I have been watching this ever since I was little and it was, for a time, the only thing I ever watched on TV. now it's on DVD and I love it. It is about a group of teens who go in to fight a virus on a super computer named X.A.N.A and stop it from coming out and taking over the world. Now I do have to say there are two cons to consider here:1)The show does get quite repetitive at times. there is very little change in the main objective to each episode though the objective does change slightly with the next season and a lot with the last two.2)These videos are printed on DVD-R disks. That means that some DVD players will not be able to play these disks. be sure to know your DVD player and it's limits before buying this.Overall, I have to say that if your into anime and don't mind the fast talking, repetitive nature, and love computers and science fiction; then this show is a must have."
3,Confederate Founding Fathers,"This book documents the friendship and political careers of two of the Confederacy's most important statesmen. Davis does a nice job of providing historical detail while also weaving a readable story. However, at times, the prose is too informal and almost needlessly dramatic. Moreover, much of the history is quite derivative, as I learned very little new information about the men in question or the political tenets of the Confederacy. His previous book, ""A Government of Our Own,"" is a much better historical treatment."
2,"Good on Kite History, Lacking on Kite Flying and Construction","The 1st 110 pages of this 220 page book are about the history of kites. Interesting, and very well illustrated with old photos. If that's what you're interested in, it's probably a five star. If you're interested in flying a kite today, then it's more like a one star. The section on building and flying kites is very poorly illustrated. If you're not already proficient in kite building, and you haven't seen a prototype of the kite you're trying to build in person, I'm guessing this book won't get you off the ground. There is some discussion about kite flying tips, types of line, and reels, though it seems thrown together, and again poorly illustrated."
5,Maybe the best ever kite book,I bought my first copy of this in 1976 and have worn out three copies in the intervening years. I have many kite books in my collection but still come back to this one for inspiration - time after time. Less is more and this is certainly the case with Pelham's book. If I was going to a desert island and was allowed one book this would be the one!
5,Bridge Instruction Book,Bridge is a very difficult game and one can become frustrated very early in the learning process. This book is an ideal way to get started and learn easily in a simplified form. It is sort of a Bridge for Dummies book. It's a fun way to learn. I love it.
4,Written for those who like illustrations,Good book...easy to understand. I was given one by a friend...bought this one for another friend I would like to encourage to learn. Then we can be nubie bridge players together.
2,I was not satisified,I bought this staff for my boyfriend for his birthday. My major problem was when I got the staff there was a large crack in one of the sections. Also it was suppose to come with a carrying case and the staff never came with one. Another problem was weapons mart never replied back to my two emails I sent them.
3,Be Very Careful with the Spray Protectant,"I bought this kit for care of a brand new leather coat and boots. I tried out a small area first and all seemed well. The boots came out great, but when I sprayed the coat, after about 5 minutes, I noticed gray patches and may tiny spray spots! Just rubbing them didn't make them go away. I have used the conditioner and they seem to have disappeared. I hope it will be ok, it is a $300 leather coat I just got in the mail and haven't even wore! I figured since I did the color fastnest test, all would be good. It was not.Norma >^..^<"
5,super soft,I could not believe the quilty of the rug when I got it. it is so thick and so soft. The photo really does not do this rug justice. It says it is a great kitchen rug but I got mine for my bedroom and I'm over joyed that I did. They are worth a lot more than what you pay for them.
2,Same old song and dance,This is nothing new. If you are at a point where you want to start your own business. Use the free stuff that you can get from the small business administration. There are also non-profit organization to help. This book might amp you up a bit. But bottom line? Just do it!
2,Nothing new for me,Nothing new for me. But will have been very valuable when I started on the Internet.
5,You're Not Alone,"This is exactly what you'd want from a business book. It's like having a really smart, successful friend coach you on everything they've learned about striking it rich. It's great too for women who want to start a business from home but don't know how to get started.If you know anyone who has started a business or is thinking about it,send them this book immediately."
2,can get more for your money,These work ok.. they will crackle if there to close to each other so on a computer desk it difficult to get the room required to avoid this. led lights only work on high volumes. Basically you can get a nice set of logitech for less then half ($23) the price and imo work and sound alot better then these (and take up less room). unless you have seen these in person and know this is what you want I recommend looking eleswhere for you speakers.
3,Chiltons not as good as they used to be,"As a guy who works on the car on the weekends when it needs it, I just think that this book leaves alot to be desired. I have a Haynes manual for my other car and it runs rings around this in my view"
1,Painfully Trite,"""For two decades now I've been awaiting a book explaining computers and their social consequences to literate readers,"" claims the author. Readers with similar hopes will not find satisfaction in this book. Rather, Rawlins casually addresses important issues concerning the role of computers concerning privacy, war, and poverty with no apparent insights or solutions. His descriptions of technologies are insultingly simplistic; one wonders if an average high-school student might have more interesting views on computers. This book's lack of footnotes and bibliography adds support to this reader's suspicion that the author just wrote down whatever came to mind. If Rawlins still wonders about computers and ""their social consequences,"" he might try reading Niel Postman's ""Technopoly"" or any of the brilliant works of Theodore Roszak."
2,An unengaging read.,"In the preface, the author poses many naturally interesting questions like ""Who will become the information aristocracy and who will becomes the infoserfs of the next generation?"". The book proper, however, doesn't do much to answer them.Primarily, the author rambles on vaguely about the possible synergy between humans and computers/robots in the near future. He also highlights the challenges that the complexity of recent and future technologies pose. There do appear some interspersed interesting tidbits, as well. But, in the end, this book is not really thought-provoking. If you are even moderately aware of modern technologies that pervade human societies in developed economies, you will not gather any novel impressions from this book."
4,Excellent but incomplete,"Kaplan's Math Workbook clearly explains most of the math skills tested by the GRE and includes a large number of practice exercises in all areas and at all difficulty levels. What's more, it guides you incrementally from the easy to the hard, so even the math-phobic will find it approachable. It's main flaw --inexplicable, inexcusable and potentially dire--is it's lack of probability and coordinate geometry review. Both of these concepts will be on your GRE exam and if you don't review them from another source source, you will be underprepared. Overall, though, it's an excellent book."
2,Meh,"Although I found this book to be fairly easy to follow, I felt that it was too simplistic. I am not sure how the GMAT exam is in terms of how the questions are asked but I did not find this to be aligned with the GRE. Topically, perhaps. But I found many of the questions to be far easier than those on the GRE and not even presented the same way as the GRE questions.I will give this book credit for providing explanations for basic things. If you find that you are in need of a beginner's explanation of things, down to different terms you may see for multiplication, this may be a good starter book. Otherwise, look to other resources to practice the quantitative section of the GRE."
3,So far so good.....,"To be honest, i have not actually began using b/c i will not take the gre until march. have glanced through and seems sufficient."
4,Rock solid album,"Yeah, Yeah, I know.... He is a sellout. People thesedays like to say ""contrived"" because they think itmakes them sound smart. This is a really good albumwith the mix of alot of things.. You hear Blues, Soul,Rock and a small bit of pop. Really, I think all ofthese things made the album as strong as it is.I think blues albums need this or they start to becomerepetitive. This album is just full of really goodsongs that have some blues playing with soul likevocals. It mixs alot of the different genres I listentoo.Best tracks:-Second Guessing-Walking Away-Cherry Red Wine-Still Rainin'-Wander This World-The Levee-Breakin Me-Leaving To StayIt's a real shame he went to far pop on his next album."
5,I was very surprised...,"...since I had no clue who Jonny Lang was. My roomie had left the cd in my computer and one day, I played it. Not too often do I like an ENTIRE cd, but WANDER THIS WORLD is excellent. Sure, the age of the artist might be the most amazing thing, but honestly, his lyrics, his voice, his songs are truly divine. Breakin' Me is soulful and romantic. This cd will blow you away."
4,I'm impressed,"Heard Breakin' Me and went out and bought the CD. The first run through I kept hearing Clapton, second run through a cross between Cocker and Clapton. I like what I've heard so far and look forward to more."
2,artificial and contrived,"Comparing Jonny Lang's version of Cherry Red Wine to that of Luther Allison's and you would think Jonny is having a bowel movement with all the gratuitous grunts and groans. It just becomes artificial and contrived. The song becomes a shallow version of the other, a white boy singing the blues without the real depth and feeling needed to understand the pain and sorrow.."
1,I Tried,"I tried ignoring the cliche ridden lyrics - I tried overlooking the same worn out scales and the boring, unneccesary solos - I tried to forgive the raspy, hoarse vocals - I tried to forgive the careless, infintile plagarism of Clapton and SRV - I tried to accept the absence of any chord changes that weren't stock - I tried to convince myself that melody and harmony are optional - I reminded myself that he was just a kid... and it made no difference. I tried to feel whatever he was feeling and felt bored. This was the longest 50 minute album I have heard in quite some time - seemed to take 2 hours. Whatever talent he is alleged to have escapes me entirely."
1,Fluffy the Blues Puppy Strikes Again,Insipid blues ape-ing by a young guy who knows lots of licks. Inspired blues it ain't.
4,Wow!,"Once again the boy wonder plays like none other. From the moment the CD hit my player, I've felt the need to listen to this collection over and over. A must buy for anyone who likes some nice guitar blues!"
2,Wandering Away,"I really enjoyed Jonny's first album Lie to Me and bought this one in glorious anticipation without having heard it. What attracts me to blues music is primarily the sound of the guitar alone in its soulful journey guided by a skilled hand that can make you FEEL what it feels. For me, its all about the guitar and this album is sorely lacking in hot licks. I listened to it one time then promptly donated it to the local library. I recommend Indigenous- Live at Pachyderm if you like something new with hot licks."
5,wonder this world,"This is the first of his work that I had. I gave my first copy to a friend. Just absolutely love this CD. Soulful, wrenching in some ways. Gets into your brain even when you aren't listening to him."
3,Don't Put too Much faith in it,"This is a classic example of follow-up disc. In this case, the album has gone too much to the producers. The songs themselves are good, but on most of the tracks, Jonny's voice is so mixed out that you can hardly here him. Which is a shame, because Jonny has an amazing voice. There are some good songs on there, and his guitar playing is good. But compared to Lie To Me, this just seem weak"
5,Climbing the Blues Ladder,"As time passes by we need a next generation of great performers and Jonny Lang is it. This album shows that with time things really do get better. The level of his talent is truley shown with great songs like,""Second Guessing"",""Breakin' Me"",""Still Rainin'"" and of course ""Wander This World"". I have seen Jonny at a few different venues from House of Blues to Pechanga Indian Reservation. He fires up the people immediatley and the reason i say people is because there are people from every race,in every color and at every age. Wander This World is just another sign of what is next to come. Here's a little thought i leave with you ,imagine how Jonny will be when he hits BB Kings age, I CAN'T WAIT!"
2,Not the classic they say it is,"I have heard a lot of talk of Johnny Lang being the new Stevie Ray Vaughn. I got more of an impression that he sings like Stevie and sometimes Joe Cocker but was not impressed with the guitar work. Doesn't hold a candle to Stevie or Bonnie Raitt or B.B. If you want Stevie Ray's guitar work, this cd is not it!@"
1,jonny lang and william shatner,"Maybe they could do a duet! Shatner does a mean cover of ""Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds"" Leonard Nimoy harmonies (maybe a little rapping too) would be nice... I think Jonny's guitar playing is as overwrought as his singing - does Shatner play guitar?"
1,William Shatner Blues,"Geez, lay off the wah-wah pedal. This is Suburban Mall Blues, phony and shallow as can be. The vocals border on hilarious, over the top - perhaps Jonny will be remembered as the William Shatner of blues singers. The overall effect is a mix of boredom and anger over having wasted $15 on this CD. There is a lot of great blues and blues rock music, both old and new, and this is not some of it."
1,SELLING OUT AT 17 QUITE IMPRESSIVE,SAVE YOUR MONEY JOHNNY SLOW DOWN YOUR MUSIC PLAY SOME BLUES PAY SOME DUES WEAR DOWN YOUR SHOES THIS AINT NO UPWARDLY MOBILE FREEWAY THIS IS THE ROAD TO HELL LISTEN TO SOME CHRIS REY GOOD GOING DONT PUSH IT
5,oh my god...,"music is my life...it is my heart and soul...i have found very few artist in my time whose voice literally make me weep...i am a writer yet i am uncharacteristicly proud to admit that there are no words to describe the jonny lang experience...all i can say is ""i don't wanna be in love...but you're making me...let me up i've had enough...you're breakin' me..."""
5,this kid is awsome,I am blown away!!!! this kid has so much tallent its flowing out his ears.I swear Jonny lang and KWS where seperated at birth.Id like to see them hook up and tour.Jonny's not a clapton or a SRV but hes geting there and hes geting there fast this kid plays the guitar like he has been doing it for many years and sings like hes some sort of blues god. well I guess he is but hes only 18 or 19years old. even if you dont like blues you hafta admit the kid has talent that is going to go a long long way go check him out!!!!!!!!!
5,The best CD I've ever purchased!,"Jonny Lang is the man. Not by too many months, though! =) This 18-year-old guitarist is by far one of the best I've heard. Not a Clapton, but give him a few years. Gotta love the Camel nonfilters voice. Keep it up, Jonny!"
3,Worthy Effort By A Blues Newcomer,"I was a young musician once, so I try to be fair here. But hearing Lang will make most listeners long for older, more accomplished bluesmen. Still quite enjoyable and augurs well for a successful career By Jonny Lang."
5,A CD that will make you a True Lang Fan,"A friend gave this CD to me for a birthday present. Since listening to the songs the first time, I have been hooked on Jonny. This CD has everything from Rock/blues, ballads, to Louisana Blues! There is something for everyone. This CD also shows how much this young man is maturing in his talents. A MUST have for anyone that likes good music! It hooked me on this man...and I have no doubt that it will do the same for you!Walkin' Away, Breakin' Me, Cherry Red Wine, I Am....my very favorites...but ALL are great tunes.Enjoy your purchase, it's worth every penny!"
2,Very dissapointing...,"After buying lie to me , I am very dissapointed in this CD. I am one of those who think he should have stayed with the hard edge blues sound. There is enough sappy music out there already. I gave it a 2 only because of still raining!! Better luck next time Jonny!!! You are an amazing Talent.."
2,Sophomore slump? perhaps...,"Lang's follow-up to his smokin' ""Lie to Me"" leaves a lot to be desired. The opening track, ""Still Rainin'"" has a good feel to it, and ""Second Guessing"" is well written, but the remainder of the album trails off from there. The rest of the tracks are a noble aim, perhaps aimed at more of a pop/funk ear, but Johnny misses fails to nail down the sound that makes him one of the best young bluesmen in the business. Lang still rocks in concert and even legends like Buddy Guy have had less than stellar recordings. The bottom line: Not his best, but Lang will be back."
4,He got it right this time!,"Guitar prodigies are a dime dozen these days. Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Shannon Curfman, Susan Tedeschi. Most, with the distinct exception of Tedeschi (she's over 25, after all!) offer little more than the standard heavy riffing heavily borrowed from the masters of yesteryear. Been there, done that, right? Jonny Lang's debut album ""Lie to Me"" gave us little reason to believe he would be any different. Then came ""Wander This World."" Showing a maturity long beyond his years, Lang brings a willingness to explore soul and R&B to his catalogue.""Second Guessing"" has an almost Sam Cooke kind of feel to it. Lang's vocals on tracks such as ""Leaving to Stay"" have developed a soulful tone that is very appealing. Mind you, the kid can still rock out, as tunes like ""Right Back"" fully attest, but when he wants to he can simmer it right down with a scorching ballad like the title track. This kid's come a long way in two short outings and the future looks bright."
3,"Eclectic, But Interesting","This is an interesting experimentation into the areas of funk and soul. The contrasting styles are sometimes jarring, and Lang sometimes needs to pull back on the overdone vocals, as in ""Cherry Red Wine"". But the incredible talent is obvious. If you approach it with an open mind, and don't expect all blues, it's a good effort."
3,BETTER THAN STEVIE???? NO,"I am from Minnesota, and I have been hearing about Lang for a long time. I have his CDs, and i'm going to say that this one isn't as good as Lie To Me. But he has great talent and will only get better. Do not listen to the person who reviewed this before me.Better than stevie?? I assume he means Stevie Ray Vaughn, but that wouldn't make sense, because Johnny shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as him."
5,IT KNOCKS ON YOUR DOOR !,"JONNY LANG HAS BEEN A FAVORITE OF MINE SINCE HE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR OF THE R&B SCENE. LIE TO ME & WANDER THIS WORLD ARE TRUE WORKS OF HIS TASTY TALENT. I LOOK FORWARD TO HIS NEXT ALBUM WITH HOPEFULLY WITH A COUPLE OF BLUES ROCKERS AND A DEEP POWERFULL R&B BALLOD. I FEEL THE SOUL IN HIS MUSIC. HE'S SO SOULFULL, MEATY & SOLID. I SURELY WOULD LOVE TO PLAY DRUMS IN HIS BAND, ANYONE WHO DOES IS VERY VERY LUCKY, I HOPE WE MAY MEET SOMEDAY JONNY LANG!"
4,"Don't let this kids age fool ya, HE's GOOD!","For one so young, he has a real good feel for the blues. Jonny Lang jams, no he's not Stevie Ray, but I think he has the makings of, if given the chance. Don't count this kid out, I think he will be around for awhile. I own and enjoy both his CD's. Jonny keep playing those blues!!"
4,David Z's touch is apparent,"While this effort is more ""radio-oriented"" than ""Lie to Me"", nonetheless, I am enjoying the musical evolution of Mr. Lang. Nine of the twelve tracks are quite good with, IMHO, three that border on greatness: the Prince-penned ""I Am"", the hip (co-written by Lang) ""Before You Hit The Ground"", and, of course, the splendid title track. Regardless of how ""produced"" the naysayers may feel this is, hey , he's how old? I look forward to see if his songwriting will evolve because his voice is timeless. Until then I'll enjoy the hooks he and Cropper provide here."
4,a great record,Wander this world is one of the finest records after LIE TO ME.The songs are superb with some guitar solos.Highly recommended.
5,Wander This World is Amazing,"This album is simply amazing. Jonny keeps getting better better. He tries some different styles of music on this follow up to Lie To Me. There are very few albums where I love every single song on it, and this is one of those albums. I even enjoy this Import even better because it contains 2 additional songs that weren't on the U.S. version. Those songs are Stop Pushin' On Me and If This Is Love. If you already have Wander This World then you really need to get this version, you will not regret it. If you don't have this album at all, then you will definately need to get it. This album should be on top of the charts but I think it's only because not everyone has heard it yet. So order this right now, drop everything and order."
4,exhilirating peice of blues work for a up and coming star.,"This cd marks an astonishment on an ever growing career in blues for a 18 year guitarist from minnasota.He mixes blues with a modern blend of his own,with catchy songs such as (breakin me,second guessing and i am)to the deep song enthusiasm he puts in such great song as the leeve and cherry red wine. He surely will someday follow in a great group of guitarist's such as eric clapton and jimi hendrix he can only get better in time. This cd his second following the prior release LIE TO ME is a 4 star only miscounting for 1 star cause he is just so young but just oh so talented WANDER THIS WORLD is every thing you want in a blues/modern rock compilation so i recommend you buy this for an ever loving blues fan in your home they certainly will enjoy. If this review isn't enough to convince you check out the sample show above to listen to this great young bluesman crank out the rock solid blues."
3,not as good as the first one,"i really enjoy his first alblum . enough to sit in the pouring rain with my wife at vinoy park,st.pete and he was a no show! what's up with that?anyway it left us alittle wet. so is this new alblum. the old man made it mr. b.b. king! still a good show. c----u"
4,Great Sophmore effort succeeds,"Many Sophmore cd's fail because of a successful first effort. This one is great -- not a bad cut on the cd. Only it is being advertised as an *enhanced cd* and it is NOT an *enhanced cd*. No multimedia stuff here. That being the only disappointment, this cd is highly recommended."
4,funkadellic meets the blues with a kid in control,Another winner from the premier 'junior' member of the blues world.
5,Lang's talent again explodes way beyond his years.,"Heard several of these tracks this summer at the Blues and Jazz Festival in Kansas City and the kid blazes and amazes! I've been bugging the local music store about the release date and I'll be the first one there tomorrow. Also, catch the interview special about him which airs every other month or so on VH-1. All this talent and he's a great guy, too."
1,you wandered away!,"lie to me was a wonderful solid blues album, which was an amazing coming from a 15 year old kid! in wander this world, he edged away from the blues into the territory of hard rock, and funk that should have stayed unrecorded! the best track on this album is his take on luther allison's cherry red wine. if the entire ablum had been of this caliber, it would have done his debut justice; as it is he could be turning into every other kid who plays a guitar. if you are looking for a jonny lang ablum, buy lie to me!"
1,Too much over-produced sugar,"He's a good guitarist, vocals are getting better and the rest ????? If your going to play the blues it needs to come from the heart. Not some sugar coated producer in a recording studio. And get rid of the ""Do Wa"" girls in the background."
1,Shatner!,"Yes! The William Shatner of Blues Singers! I love it, although Shatner (the man) might be offended - does this mean that he is the Johnny Lang of TV Actors??? Johnny's singing IS good for a laugh, just like Shatner's star trek emoting."
1,"Phony, shallow, wanking bore.","Is this the blues? Is this soulful guitar? Nosiree and Nope. This is contrived, over polished and insincere. The record company sure paid for a lot of radio time for it though, wow. Good marketing, I'll say that much."
4,One song makes the album,"This is about par for the course, as far as cover albums go. It could have included an extra Zep-standard or two, at least instead of the 'overture' which makes up most of When The Levee Breaks. To me, it's makes no sense to put in bits of all the other songs. Being a Dokken fan, I may be biased, but Don's version of Kashmir is absolutely phenomenal."
5,Buy 1.,"My buddy Frankie plays on this...So maybe I,m a little biased,,,It,s a fun cd,,,has a lot of good guest players,,,and it,s cheap,,,Buy 2!"
2,Assassins book - this is only the libretto,"I assumed this would be a book about the assassins featured in the show - didn't realise it's only the lyrics, which I have anyway in the CD. Quite disappointed."
5,Life Changing Book,I ordered again and agin for my friends after reading this book. I have not finder any other book give me such life changing inspiration!Thanks Dr. Norwood!Super Stars!
5,A Classic for Everyone!,"Michael Norwood brings humanity a treasure to be savored, and experienced by any human being who wishes to embrace, expand, and enhance their life on every level. His spiritual aptitude is profound, as is this book. It is a book that will surely become a classic in the twenty-first century.Highly recommended from my heart, Barbara Rose, Author of If God Was Like Man"
4,"Nice, easy Read","Unlike Tamar Myers, Charlaine Harris appears to give more thought to her chief protagonist Aurora Teagarden. She is given personality with an intropective side that adds believability to her decision-making and actions. While reflecting on the death of her husband Martin, Roe is able to function as a librarian, re-ignite a former romance, list her house and move into the city, and find time to have her life threatened and be instrumental in solving a murder. In other words the mystery of an actress' death does not interfere with the daily routine of living and being Aurora(Roe)Teagarden. The naturalness of situations and events are what makes this work so plausible.I think I shall visit Ms. Teagarden's world again. it was fun being with her if only but a few brief hours."
4,Love this series!,"I love this series! Good mysteries. Aurora is likable. It is not as supernatural as some of this author's other books. I don't understand why the tag paranormal romance is on some reviews, because there's not a lot of paranormal activity. And, there's romance, but it's not overdone. These are cozy mysteries, not War and Peace, so if you are looking for a serious book, this is less for you. I think cozies are good to read between really serious novels, though this series was really good and I read it straight through."
2,Did someone murder the editor?,"This is my least favorite of the series thus far. This one just didn't have the same feel as the others have had. It's like the author was trying to write about characters that she hadn't visited for many years. That being said, it was a fun read, it just didn't feel right.My main complaint about this one is the editing. Oh, the inconsistencies! Characters from previous books that should be older are now years younger than when we last heard of them. Time spans have changed completely. Did absolutely no one check the time line of previous books? Maybe you'll skip right over them without noticing, but it drove me nuts!"
4,Last scene alive,Last scene alive is a great follow up to a fool and his honey. I love the Aurora Teagarden series.
4,Aurora is back! (possible spoilers),"Aurora is now widowed for almost a year. She is sad but ready to move on with her life. Suddenly, her long-gone love interest Robin Crusoe shows up in Lawrenceton for the filming of TV series based on his book about the murders narrated in the first Aurora Teagarden mystery ""Real Murders."" Martin's son Barrett appears in Roe's life too as he has a small role in the series. Filming goes on as scheduled; our heroine gets a taste of Hollywood; everything is exciting. That is until an actress who plays Aurora is found dead in her movie set trailer. Needless to say, Roe is destined to solve this mystery.I liked this book as much as (or maybe more than) the previous Aurora Teagarden mystery. I felt a new life was poured into our heroine. I enjoyed seeing her come back to her funny and cheerful self and fall in love again. It was quite a pleasure to read."
3,last scene alive,"I really like this series, so I hate to give it a mediocre review. I just found it boring, plain and simple. There was no suspense and no huge revalation. That being said, I would definitely recommend the other books in this series."
1,What's up with the price of this book,I guess I should pay better attention from now on. Usually a book this old is much cheaper on Kindle but this one cost more than a brand new addition. I'll pay better attention next time and maybe I should start downloading a little less
4,If you love Charlaine Harris...,"If you love Charlaine Harris like I do, then you will like the Aurora Teagarden Mysteries. Aurora isn't anything like Sookie, but she has her own charm. I find I dive into anything written by Ms Harris. I just think she is a wonderful writer. My favorite is The Southern Mysteries (the stories that True Blood is based on) but I have enjoyed everything I have read by charlaine Harris. I always care about her characters, and Aurora is a sweet heart."
1,Enough's enough,I agree completely with the statements made by the 2 previous commentators. This price is ludicrous and frankly makes me acknowledge my heretofore unadmitted unhappiness with $6++ paperback pricing. I love my Kindle but I'm starting to feel decidedly unloved in return.
4,i loved it!!!!!!!!!!,I really liked it. It is not something for immature kids because of the certain romance seens and certain topics like people who aren't married sleeping together and having the parents okay with it. But anyway i liked it even though some of the characters are totally stupid.
1,"This book, to put it simply, SUCKED","I read this book expecting a good, interesting read like Manning's previous novel, Guitar Girl. Unfortunately, I got a nasty surprise. This novel pretty much sucked. The characters were shallow and I frequently got them mixed up with each other. I found that I kind of liked Charlie as a character, bu the way he treated Brie just got on my nerves, and I didn't even LIKE Brie in the book. This book was very ridiculous and just left me angry and confused at it. No way am I ever getting near it again."
3,"Okay, not great. You get what you pay for.","Not bad, not good either. I've had this stand for a few years. This has served for a Yamaha 61 pro model bari for lots of rock and blues gigs with raucous fans--its been knocked over only a couple times, and would have been on ANY stand. Still, this stand definitely marred the surface of the horn under the bell a bit, but I'm as much at fault for not taking the time to better protect it. The only negative of the stand is that the tension bolts are difficult to adjust, and are too small to get enough tension on the support riser. Still, for what I paid for it, I'm not complaining."
5,'Confessions' stands out,"An excellent memoir of the madness that was China's Cultural Revolution. Well-written, in-depth and even-handed. The author's description of his imprisonment for ""thought crimes"" is chilling."
4,Added to my collection,"This item is about what I expected. The price was good and it arrived quicker than I expected. Minor thing, It is actually packaged as you see it from left to right in stead of individually. I would have to unwrap to ad to my collector shelf as I have all prior seasons unopened. Other than that , nice price"
4,Soccer at it funniest!,"Disney Sports Soccer is a great soccer game! The game itself though is tough! Easier than ""DSFootball"", but not as complex as ""DSSKateboarding""! I can't say if you should buy or not, Great multiplayer game however!"
5,This game is AWESOME!!,"This game is one of the best games that I have ever played. It is fun to see the players fall down or pass the ball to their other players. This game is awesome because you get to replay your fouls, pick your stadiums, pick your teams and play!! You should try playing this game with your family members because it just makes you laugh and smile and have fun."
1,wow,"This is the worst game i have ever tested the max number of pixel formats on this game is only 1,546! Wow i want to speak to the programers about that. And the plot is a phenomenal disgrace. I mean come on Walt you can do better than this c ya guys and girls all around the world."
3,great packaging,"I love the Pounce containers as they do a great job of keeping snacks fresh.One of my cats loves this moist chicken treat; the other one sniffs at them and walks off. As a product I am sure it varies cat to cat, but as far as packaging goes, I like it!"
2,"If you are looking for pictures, don't go for this.","I bought this book hoping it would have good info in a nice format, and some color pictures. There are 8 black and white pictures and it is written like a novel with chapters and everything. If you want color pictures and an easy-to-read book, don't go for this one."
1,In stock,"I am very disappointed that the 26"" rattan escrima sticks were listed as ""in stock"" and I was to find out later by Amazon, not the vendor, that the product was OUT OF STOCK. After a phone call to vendor - they said they do not have any at all and don't know when they will any more. Obviously I cancelled my order."
2,"good sticks, bad paint job","got these sticks a few years ago and they work alright. the ""stain"" is actually paint that wears off when you use them - i ended up sanding mine down and adding an actual stain to them."
3,Finish?,I bought 2 of these so I would have a set. My roommate ordered first. They do not match. Of the 3 we have 2 have a nice varnish on them. One seems like they forgot to finish. I'll spray it but shouldn't need to.
5,Good product,I use this on my lab/pitt mix even though he's a strong swimmer. Eases the mind. It keeps his head up if he gets tired and the handles are nice for pulling him out of the water and if your tubing he likes to pull people around. It didn't slide around and he didn't mind wearing it.
4,Didn't really get to try it out in water...,It fit great even though it was a bit snug for my full grown Chow. She is a little over weight but not good that XL size fit snug on her.She didn't want to go in the water out of fear so we didn't get to try it out. I think the life vest itself freaked her out...But I'm still glad we got it - for possible future use.Deliver was on time and I would order from them again...
2,Ok for occasional use,"I am a marine biologist and spend a lot of time on a small boat. My dog enjoys coming with me, and of course has to wear a PFD like everyone else. Yes, dogs can swim, but so can you, and you are still required to wear one. What if he got tired, went the wrong direction, was not visible, there was an accident? Anyway, this PFD lasted about 9 months, which was probably 30 trips. It worked okay, but didn't last well. The minute is showed signs of wear (exposed foam, ripped webbing) I threw it out, I don't want to chance it like that. So, if you are only taking your dog out a few times, this will work fine (it has a great head support), but if you are going out more, don't count on it lasting very long."
2,Dog vest review,Although the dog vest looked like it was made well and would be comfortable for our dog--the sizing wasn't even close to accurate. It advertised fitting dogs from 10-14inches in girth and less than 10 lbs. Our dog is 12 inches in girth and weighs 6.6 lbs and the vest was way too small. It had to be sent back and I went to our local Petsmart and bought her vest.
4,"Works just fine, but","Picture suggests that it is semi-transparent to see the roll level. Mine was 100% opaque pearl-ish white, and I cannot tell the roll level without opening it. The ones without the chrome base are semi-transparent."
5,Beyond words,This was an impulse buy based on the other reviews. The music is timeless and the choir is exquisite. It is now at the top of my cd stack.
4,Contemplative harmonies,"Choral collections abound but few have a sense of unity, the general preferences by the consumers so often is a 'sampler' disc of beautiful but unrelated music. AGNUS DEI is practically a formal concert by the Choir of New College, Oxford directed by Edward Higginbottom - a choral group comprised of all males, the treble voices being sung by boys and the tenor and bass lines sung by men. The quality of sound is superb and ethereal as only such choirs can sound. The variety varies from Palestrina , Bach and Mozart through Faure and Rachmaninov to Samuel Barber and John Taverner and even Gorecki. The accompaniment when indicated is the elegant organ of the New College Chapel. For those who yearn for moments of peace and inspiration, this is a first rate, high quality recording."
5,Transformed,"This CD contains works so masterfully executed that you feel that you are in a church hearing the works performed live. I used this CD in my church for meditation at Eastertide. I listen to it every day and am transported to the place that the CD advertises, a place of inner harmony. I highly recommend it."
3,There's just one problem...,"Sorry to be the voice of dissent here, but while I loved the selections, I had a bit of a problem with the sound of the choir. To my ears, there are one or two female voices that were either miked too closely in the original recording, or who just had shrill-sounding voices. Honestly, there are a couple of pieces that--again, to my ears--were pretty much ruined by the overly-prominent/piercing sound of just those one or two female vocalists. It's a shame too, because I otherwise really wanted to love this CD..."
5,magnificent,"Awesome and elite, this music feels as if New Age Jazz morphed directly from it, rather than a few centuries later. Crystal-clear voices and harmonies as tight as if they were manufactured. Eerie... lovely... mood setting... glorious."
2,Dont last long,"I bought a 10 pack of these, and each pen lasted about 2 weeks. Even though the price looks decent, one of the old style highliters lasts as long as a whole package of these."
3,"Good cups, changed quality",I liked this product alot. I had it before also and I wanted to buy them again. This time the glass was a bit thicker then before so the feel of the cup was less comfortable. The company has changed the quality of the cups. I am happily to have them again but sad about the decision on the quality.
5,"Great Rubber stamp, but too large for my uses","This rubber stamp works great. I bought it because my guitar teacher was writing out my guitar chords on a separate piece of paper from the music I am playing, so I found myself going back and forth between the music and the chords. So I wanted to stamp right about the bar, but it turns out that this stamp was too large for that, so I ended up buying the smaller 5-fret stamp, which works pretty well. I could probably still use this larger one for other purposes where I have more space, but fitting this one between lines of music didn't work for me, on the music I was working from."
3,good,not bad but not large than I expectedit's about 1inch size.(square)and easy to use. that's good.I saw one small stamp.. I wonder how small it isif this larger stamp is not that big.
1,Don't waste your money,"This dictionary is completely overpriced (I bought the hardcover, so that it would withstand repeated use!). Not a comprehensive work at all, even very ""common"" terms used in aviation are missing from it. ASA has a similar publication which is much more complete and geared toward professional pilots."
4,Exactly match the DSC-W1,"I purchased this case for Sony DSC-W1 several years ago. It is designed for the camera. It is a perfect case and I still use it. The small case in the picture is for the memory sticks. It looks like a bonus, but if you see it you just want throw it away, so I don't even remember where it was. Because of the small case I would give one star less in this review."
3,Two or one?,I don't get it. The photo shows two bags. Is it two or one? It looks decent. Has anyone purchase this yet?
3,"Just another ""Hit's"" CD","I've always enjoyed Joni Mitchell's stuff. I thought this was music I never heard before, but turns out I already have most of it. Good songs though if you are new to Joni."
1,Difficult to keep running,"This trimmer has been a problem from the time I bought it. I wish I still had the receipt. I thought it might need to break in after 2 or 3 uses. I have used it about 6 times. Today I gave up halfway through my lawn. It constantly stops especially when trying to give it gas. Full choke, half choke, run. It doesn't matter. The Weed Eater is my most regrettable yard purchase ever."
3,Can Be Retro-fitted for 5 Star Trimming,"Can Be Retro-fitted for 5 star Trimming.This Trimmer was worthless before I retro-fitted itwith a Grass Gator(R) 8010 Replacement Trimmer Head Kit.The Grass Gator (Load n' Cut) Trimmer Head allowedme to use 0.155 inch diameter Maxi-Edge trimmingline by Arnold -- I cut 4 pcs of 6 inch long line.The Maxi-Edge trimmer line only wore about 0.5 inches after one useon some aggressive edging. I would have gone through at leasta spool of the original trimmer line.The 0.155 Maxi-Edge timming line that I used is actually intendedfor a line mower and is commercial grade.It saved me time, money and a lot of frustration.If this Weed Eater came with the retro-fited head it would beone of the best on the market.Out of the box this trimmer is a 1 or 2 star trimmer.With the Retro-fit noted above -- it becomes a 5 star trimmer.So I rated it at 3 stars because I had to do a $15 retro-fit tobring it up to 5 star level."
4,Pretty Good,This trimmer works well. My only complaint is that it seems to use up the string very fast. I have only used it three times and the first two times used up a full reel each time. It may just be because this is the first gas powered trimmer I have used and just needed to get used to it because the last time went better.
1,Garbage,"A complete waste of money and a piece of junk, as everyone else has noted. I would add that if you do manage to figure out how to live with the low power and constant stalling, you will then experience the primer bulb cracking, which is a different, non-replaceable one from all other weedeaters. Worthless."
2,Not for a big yard.,"Good price for a fairly decent weed eater. The main complaint I have is that the cutting head is not far enough from the handle for a taller person to use without bending over. It was almost impossible for me to maintain a level cut because the head is angled downward and would gouge into the grass. I thought that a 25CC engine would have plenty of power, but this one fell short of expectations. In taller weeds, it would bog down and occasionally the cutting line would feed out when I did not want it too. This weed eater would probably do fine for some light duty usage, but if you're going to do some serious cutting, you might want to look at something else.I wrote this review and later decided that I would return the item to Amazon. Just discovered that they do not accept returns on any gasoline powered equipment. So I would suggest that before you order anything online, be sure it is what you want"
3,very hard to start.,"This is the lightest weedeater I've ever used. Also, it is the hardest to start weedeater I've ever used.If you are buying this because of the light weight, i.e. you have a problem handling the ""heft"" of other trimmers, I think you should consider buying another trimmer. If physical strength is the problem, you will have much more of a problem continually pulling the cord and getting this thing started than simply holding it to use. For me, getting it started is major irritant, but the light weight is very handy on a steep hillside I have to cut. Therefore, the tradeoff is OK for me. I don't think that is the case for most people."
2,"Don't ever buy this, it won't last more than 5 minutes on running","This machine sucks, there must be something wrong in the design. It is reaally tough to start, and it won't last more than 5 mins after start. You are wasting your money and enerty to restart this small engine every 3-5 minutes, and take about 3 minutes to get it running."
3,Lightweight Weed Eater,"Started fairly easily, though it does take longer than expected to warm up so the choke can be shut off. Like the light weight of the weed eater -- that's the main reason I bought it. Would prefer a single-line unit, as the double-line is more difficult to ""fix"" when it's necessary to remove the line head and refeed the line. Also, this model seems to quit rather easily if the lines are too long (rather than the lines being cut off by the protection guard), or if the weeds being cut are thick. Have to run it at quite high speeds just to keep it running. I do like the unit, though not as much as I had expected as I've had great experiences with Weed Eater equipment in the past. Would I buy it again? Not if I could find a comparitively light weight unit that had only one line, which I couldn't."
3,It's easy to use,Bought this blower for the driveway...it serves its purpose. Good value for the money. I don't need an expensive blower for my driveway...I only use it once a month...or if I have a lot of leaves and little twigs. It's easy to use...easy to store.
2,Impossible to review because...,when the weed eater arrived...the box had no packaging! Needless to say the weed eater was is no shape to even try to start to see if we liked it. The casing is cracked and the shaft has an additional curve. I was under the impression I had ordered a new product but the way is was NOT packaged has me wondering! Now Amazon says we cannot return it because it uses gas--even though we haven't put gas in it I sure hope that doesn't mean they aren't giving us our money back!
4,Weedeater good,Unit arrived very quickly which was great since my other one died. Put gas in it and primed it the six times and started on the second pull. Only one negative thing is that the unit is shipped in it's original box and when it got here it was pretty beat up but no damage on the inside. Just thought additional packing would lessen the risk of damage.
1,JUNK !,I would not recommend this item to anyone. I used it less than 30 minutes when it quit and would not start again ! Hedge Clippers would work better than this garbage.
4,Easy Starting Lightweight Weed Trimmer,"I was satisfied with this product after using it. No problem at all starting. It has good motor response and is easy to control with a well designed trigger for accelerating. The line feed worked OK, except motor needs to be going fast for line to cut itself. It seemed a little hesitant before warming up, but further usage will help to learn when to adjust the choke. Best part is its light weight, since extended use will not cause arm fatigue. Should be adequate to use for most housholds."
1,Out Of Box Did Not Work,"Cord... Unable to pull, Amazon will not take back because of gas/mail, will cost $30 to fix. Will now buy from Wal-Mart or Sears. Will now buy electronics at Best Buy and books from Barnes and Noble. Wasted at Amazon$80!I was loyal they were not. Took my money and gave me a defective, nonreturnable item! Not Happy!"
1,hard to keep running,I followed the starting and running steps and it won't stay running I will have someone take a look at it. I would not buy again .
5,Just what it's supposed to do,"My husband loves it. We know these things don't last forever, and this is a very good price for a starter or replacement unit. It works fine in all dimensions."
2,Wee eater,The dual feed string gets caught up often and will not easily extend when tappped. I have had to stop often to get manually extend the string.
2,Non ergonomic string Trimmer,"You would think as long as Weed Eater has been in business they would be smart enough to design a trimmer that the engine doesn't try to go through your forearm when holding the machine in the operating position. It seems to have plenty of power but very little speed variation. It is basically off or full speed. I really would like to return this but don't want to go through the trouble just yet, maybe I can make it work by leaning over level with the yard while I trim."
2,WEEDEATER,"I THOUGHT I HAD ORDERED A ONE STRING,TWO SPOOL ,8 POUND WEED EATER.I RECIEVED A TWO STRING,ONE SPOOL,ONE. IT DOESN'T DO AS GOOD A JOB WEED EATING AS MY OLD ONE,AND SEEMS HEAVIER AND LONGER. I LOVED MY OLD ONE,IT HAD LASTED ME FOR I0 YEARS.I WAS DISSAPOINTED WHEN I GOT MY NEW ONE,BUT I KEPT IT,BECAUSE I NEEDED IT RIGHT THEN."
1,Did Not Work Once,"My wife purchased this model for me as a Father's Day gift. I carefully read the owner's manual and attempted to start the trimmer. It would not start. I tried again the next day and the next. In two weeks time, this piece of garbage would not start once. Customer service at Poulan was no help at all. I will not purchase any Poulan/Weedeater product again."
3,Hard to read,"The description did indicate that the book is an ""inexpensive paperback."" However, I was still disappointed that the print is rather faint & hard to read and that the left margins of the right-hand pages are so close to the binding that it is difficult to read entire lines without adjusting the book angle. If I could have seen the way it was printed, I would not have ordered it."
3,interesting??,"The book was interesting in the telling of fairy tales, but was hard to relate to any American tales. I did enjoy reading the different tales and how they related to other Eurpean tales."
5,Great Classroom Theme Book,"This book is not only a great adventure for middle grade readers, but it is a useful tool for classroom teachers. My class (fourth/fifth graders) read this book for our theme: The Maya. The book gave authentic facts about the Mayan culture and a plausible explanation for the demise of their culture. We used the book as the backbone of several language arts exercises such as: written and oral reports about the Maya, literary criticism of characters, plot, and sequence, persuasive essays on human sacrifice vs. murder and Mayan culture vs. our own culture; and art projects from wood burning to mapping. We studied geography and the rainforest. The students' enthusiasm for this book pushed our curriculum into other disciplines including math. I recommend this book to teachers and to middle grade students."
5,Owned my copy since 1975,"The best yoga book ever. Simple, no b.s., yoga. For each pose, you get how to get there, how to start out, and what the pose does for you, particularly internally. This book was recommended to me by a college friend in 1975, I bought it and have carried it with me around the world. I think this might be especially good for beginners. No pressure, no pretty skinny girls in tights. Just Swami!Integral Yoga Hatha"
4,Who can I trust?,It's a firme cd It's got one or two jams I aint feeling but most are good jams.The most recent Oso and Kid is a little better.
2,call me crazy...,"maybe I'm crazy, but I thought this recording stunk. Others are raving about it, but I found her playing to be superficial...Technically good, yes, but without much real soul or contemplation. I simply don't like pianists who play for themselves and not for the music. I hear more of her than of Brahms, even though he was the one who put down the notes. Too many performers impose themselves on the music. I agree with Stravinsky, who despised the notion of ""interpretation"". Usually this amounts to dramatic gestures and melodramatic posing, while overlooking the real meaning and beauty of the music..."
5,Grimaud plays Brahms,"My title says it -- Grimaud is an extraordinary pianist, but more, a discerning and gutsy musician. She listens; Brahms is Brahms, not, as far as i can tell, Grimaud; likewise the other composers she champions. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
1,That poor piano,"She just bashes the piano. It is actually hard to listen to me. Sometimes she plays soooo fast that you cannot hear all of the notes, while sometimes she plays so slow you lose a sense of rythm.I would Highly recommend Jon Nakamatsu's Recording over these. He does an absolutely amazing job."
3,A Moment with God for Teens,It is what I was looking for as a gift for a teenager. I don't know whether they liked the book or not though.
5,Fabulous!,"Saw them live and they were incredible. ""I Believe in What You Do"" is amazingly catchy. It's good pop/rock, very upbeat and cheery. I highly recommend it."
4,NCIS Season Six,"I bought this DVD set for my sister, who is a big NCIS fan. I have also become a big fan of the series, and have watched most of it on DVD now. I am a big fan of Abbey (Pauley Perrette). Highly recommended."
5,Qucik delivery,Received items quickly and the ordering was easy.Love the series. Waiting for season 7 to be released.
4,Four Stars + Spoilers May Follow,Another excellant season of NCIS with all its twists and turns each eps. was must see tv from beginning to the surpise cliffhanger of Ziva captured and being interragoted about NCIS. What I love about this show is the humor and fun that goes a long with each eps. That's what keeps me watching and it looks the actors are having just as much fun. The only weak link in the whole awsome season for me was Ziva and Michael. For supposely dating there was no chemistry between them at all which was a ashame as NCIS headed towards its amazing ending with Tony growing more suspicious of Michael ending with the awsome fight in her apartment ending with Tony killing Ziva's boyfriend I had a hard time believing the man was her boyfriend the whole thing felt flat. None of their scenes together sparked anything. Both actors were awsome with everyone except each other.
5,fantastic!!!!!!!!!!,The NCIS Team has made another great year for me to collect and watch whenever there is nothing on televison. I watch season 1-6 almost every night. So thank-you ever so much! CATHY Hensley
5,NCIS 6,Love it!! Now I have all seasons 1-6 in my collection. Keeping season 7 on DVR until it comes out next year!
5,wonderful series,I thoroughly enjoy this series. All of the characters work well together.Fun and great story lines. I would recommend to everyone.
4,good one!,Shipped to Australia. Arrived promptly and the price was still better than local. We love NCIS and can't wait to get our hands on next series.
4,Rick's Review,The product was shipped in a timely and well maintained condition. I will use this company for future needs.
4,Another great season,"Some series start to wear thin or succumb to the temptation to give the audience what they want too quickly or too superficially. Not this show. The characters remain compelling, intriguing, and entertaining, and we learn more about them without having the show drift too far into melodrama or soap opera territory."
3,Incomplete set,I order this a while back but never opened it at the time I received it. However my daughter recently opened it to watch and discovered that there is no copy of disc 5 but 2 copies of disc 1. .
1,Disk 6 does not play,"Disk 6 of Season Six of NCIS will not play. It is defective. We have tried it on two separate machines. I did not realize that I could not return or get a refund after 30 days which was Feb 23rd and it is now Feb 26th. I am very disappointed, especially since it is the season finale. I have bought every season so far, and have already had to return 2 of them due to defective disks. I hope the ones we have not gotten around to watching are not defective."
5,NCIS 6th season,"The set was packed well, arrived in short time. All DVDs were in working order so no problems watching them."
4,Good prpduct slow to ship,"I'm very happy with the product over all, came as described, but took longer to ship, once shipped it didnt take long to deliver thouht"
1,Don't buy from this company!,The 6th disc skips really bad. I contacted the seller 8 times and NEVER heard from them. I do not recommend buying from that company.
1,NCIS 6th season.,"I am sure I would have loved the product, since I collect all the seasons of NCIS. BUT, after a month of waiting, my order had not arrived and I recieved an e-mail saying the charges would be credited to my credit card. Order over. Nothing shipped. Nothing received. The vendor never carried through with his promise. I ordered on Sept. 19. I was e-mailed it had shipped Sept. 21, and on Oct. 16 was told never mind. We'll just give you back your money. NO explanation, no nothing, after waiting patiently for a month to receive my shipment. That afternoon I went to my local Hastings and bought it. Should have done that in the first place."
5,Season 6 does not Disappoint! Fantastic!!,"I regularly watch TV, but only recently became aware of NCIS and honestly, there is nothing else on TV like this show (got turned on during an ""NCIS Marathon"" on USA channel). I couldn't find the 6th season on TV, so watched it on the DVD. The 6th Season is amazing--I'm not sure how, but the writers just make this show better every season. The chemistry of the characters is complex and entertaining. There is Tony, who just can't stop talking and then Gibbs, the team boss, who says the fewest words possible...it all works beautifully, somehow! The other team members are also just as interesting. All I can say is that the 6th season expands upon all the good points of the characters & brings more complexity to the story lines. You wont' be disappointed!!"
5,Best show ever made!!!,This is by far the best show ever made. I own them all and will continue to buy each new season. The cast is perfect and the writer writes very interesting and fun shows. I love NCIS in every way!
1,Beyond useless,"Generally I like products from X-acto, but this product is pathetic. It is made to cut 45 degree bevel cuts in foam core. Fresh out of the package, the blade wouldn't do anything but tear the foam. The blade appears to be sharp, but it would only tear the foam at any angle and at any depth. I can only attribute this to very poor design, cheap construction, and no product testing. Even if the blade cut perfectly, the bevel guard is wobbly and would probably not make a straight cut. Don't buy this tool under any circumstances!"
1,"Does not cut 1/2"" foam board","Awful product. Claims that it cuts 1/2 foam board, but it doesn't. It will go probably 3/4 of ways though that's it. Piece of crap."
2,Flimsy,"I was pleased to get this product in; my goal in buying it was to cut some nice flash diffusers out of foam board for my off-camera flashes in the photo studio. Unfortunately, the very first time I used this knife, the little plastic wedge which holds the blade at 45 degrees broke off. I wasn't applying much pressure - just enough to cut foam board, but off it snapped. If you're cutting some very light materials (lighter than foamboard, I guess?), I suppose this would be fine, but for me, I felt like this was a waste of money. The theory's there but the build quality isn't."
1,Just bad.,"I have no idea how this product cuts. Why? Because I cannot assemble it and therefore have not tried to cut anything with it. The instructions are worthless, and as far as I can tell you have to remove the piece that slides the blade out to use the blade. It is completely counter-intuitive. (And really, this should not be a confusing assemble: blade, handle, screw, and piece that screws into the blade and handle to slide the blade out. It SHOULD be obvious....) Also, the dual blade system is ridiculous unless you are always making two parallel cuts. To make a normal 90 degree cut, I have to first remove the other blade? UGH. I would not recommend this product to any person who likes products that work."
1,At least they got the length right,"These are NOT made of rattan. They are oak or something hard and heavy, which is good for swinging around by yourself, but if you're sparring you need them to actually be made of rattan, that way you don't break the other person's stick. Rattan is also more flexible, so when it takes abuse it just tends to bend and not splinter into pieces.If you are going to spar, or hit sticks together in any way, look somewhere else."
3,OK,"They are good for practice. They are not hardened, so they take a bit of abuse if you practice with others that have hardened sticks."
1,junk,I got the stick. It is some sort of rattan but it is of unacceptably poor quality. The stick doesn't even have one node on it. Spend a little more money and get a deluxe rattan stick from century martial arts.
2,Mixed feelings,"This book came highly recommended by colleagues and I hoped it would be of similar quality as classic series like ""First Aid"" and ""... Made Ridiculously Simple."" However, I found the mnemonics hard to remember, not very funny and ill-fitting (for example, using TWOT for complications of exchange transfusion, ""W=where calcium is low""). I also ended up crossing out portions of text, especially the footnotes, because they were useless and distracting. There is some good info here (in spite of the typos and factual errors), but I would recommend using it only in conjunction with another text-based review as well as an atlas."
5,Excellent study guide,"I used this book as my sole review book and found it comprehensive yet easy and fun to read. Almost all the topics mentioned appeared on the actual exam or PREP review questions. The appendix was especially helpful for confusing items- for example how to remember the different erythemas (migrans vs. chronicum migrans, etc.).The question books were also great study tools. The question types (best answer, matching, graphs) are similar to those that appeared on the board exam.I highly recommend this book as a study guide in addition to the PREP questions prepared by the AAP."
2,Laughing his way to the bank...,"The idea of this book is a fine one- a concise volume to use as a study guide for the boards, peppered with humor to make an arduous task more enjoyable. Where the author fails is content and execution. The book opens with a passage about meaningless mnemonics, yet it's full of them. There are plenty of misspellings and untruths; at this price I'd expect better copy editing. Finally, and most importantly, I didn't laugh once."
1,A waste of time and money,"As a gradute of two residencies I am no stranger to board preparation, so the idea of a humerous guide was piqued my interest.This book however is not answer. There is no real content. It's superficial fluff that the author decided to market to line his pockets.There is is an early section on study techniques that is not bad, but the book is more then sub-par. Quite simply it stinks!"
2,Helpful if you are outgoing and experienced,"This book has some ideas on how to find a third person, but they all seemed to be geared towards someone with experience in same-sex or group-sex activities. If you are wanting to try this out as ""something new"" then most of these tips may be too scary or uncomfortable for you!Plus, it gives ideas like, ""Place a personal ad."" We all know about that route! Give me something I wouldnt think of myself!!!"
2,Not quite there,"The thing is that a man should have a steady relationship and if his woman is willing to try and recruit another woman for a threesome, then this book has no new information to offer. If you are lucky enough to meet such a woman then she will do all the work anyway, you can just play along while it lasts.This book serves no purpose towards realising the most popular male fantasy. All you have to do it find an openly bi-sexual woman. everybody knows its a lot harder than it sounds"
3,Not worth the effort,"I got this a while ago. It's kinda basic and common sense approach. Not much worth a read unless you are really bored. Its been a while, but I believe it was strictly limited to threesomes with 2 females and didn't even mention the other option."
