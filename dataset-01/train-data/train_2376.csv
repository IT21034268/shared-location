5,Its ok for the money.,"now some people say that it has bad picture, I had the same until I bought a new cable. If you have a higher quality cable the picture will look as good as standard tv can get."
3,Works very well... after many adjustments,"First of all, the item that is sent will NOT be the item in the picture. However the tuner still works. When I first installed the tuner, it crashed my computer. Apparently the driver did not agree with windows, and the driver recommended by windows will not work with the tuner. Nevertheless, after a few hours of messing with the driver, it eventually worked and it's been working perfectly ever since. By the way, just to clarify about video quality, for normal viewing, it's the best tuner under 30 dollars with a remote. But if you want to record, the video will not be so good, it'll be really fuzzy if you're use to dvd quality videos. And also, it will not work with Media Center (not the OS, but the program), which is quite disappointing. You should buy this only if you have the patience and technical experience to adjust those settings."
1,No Good,Installed Sabrent SBT-TVFM TV Tuner/Video Capture/FM Radio PCI Card with Remote Control.I'm running XP ProNever found the capture card.Abssolutely worthless.Was used shame on me.Do not trust these venders.Sabrent SBT-TVFM TV Tuner/Video Capture/FM Radio PCI Card with Remote Control
2,DID NOT CAPTURE VIDEO,"I installed this card in my computer and it never worked for me. I bought it to capture VHS video to my computer to edit and then record to DVD. The VCR would play through the computer but the card could not capture the video. I called manufacturer and, to their credit, told me to send it back. After paying shipping, it just wasn't worth the trouble so it sits in its box in the closet. It is very possible, too, that I didn't know how to correctly configure this capture card. I never hooked up TV to see if it worked or not."
1,1 star - first look,"i chose this card among the similar products, because the description stated that it included FM antenna. well, it doesn't include either antenna, or batteries for remote control. also it looks quite different than the one on the picture. my first impression: i strongly dislike this thing and the company that sold it. i'll update the preview when i get the antenna and intall this card"
5,Love this set,This disc set has a fantastic selection of music. Some familiar tunes and some lesser known. I didn't know how much I liked Rossini until I listened to this showcase of his works.
3,Too fast,"The sound is excellent. However, the compositions are played a little too fast. Otherwise, this would be 5 stars."
3,They're shoe covers,"Bought them so workers wouldn't dirty the carpets. They do just that. They're not fancy and inexpensive. I wish they were a little thicker, but you get what you pay for."
4,Anti skid PPSB Shoe covers,Love the shoe covers. I have big tenny shoes and they cover the fine. Just turn the seam to the inside. There great for keeping your carpet clean.
3,Size and Strength,"I found these to be serviceable, but was disappointed that the XL size was so small (which others have complained about), and that they are prone to small tears after a few hours wear."
2,"Not bad, but not great","I guess I would say that these shoe covers work pretty well if you take their limitations into account. I had somehow thought that they would be a lot more waterproof than they are (that's what you get for not reading the description carefully!) And they are NOT!! truly anti-skid, which is a problem. You will slip and slide while wearing these. That being said, they're really good for protecting your shoes if you're working outdoors and it's not raining, and they're certainly very cheap."
5,Very good product - XLarge Size,"Does the job well - i used them to save my tile, carpet and wood flooring from movers and workers - no issues. These covers do the job well.I wear a size 9 shoe and they fit with ease."
3,"Not bad, but a little slippery.","These shoe covers were purchased to cover a men's size 8 1/2, 6E width shoe. They fit, but I wouldn't expect them to fit more than one or two shoe sizes bigger than that. I felt a little insecure on our highly polished wooden floors with these on. They felt a little slippery despite the non-skid claims. That said, I'll still probably order them again."
1,Not Satisfied!,"When ordering 2 sets, the items are placed in the same box, which is mislabeled. The Large and Extra Large booties are basically the same size, maybe 1/4 inch bigger for Extra Large. When asked Customer Service about our order, we received an extremly unprofessional and rude email back regarding our order. I would NOT recommend this or any Medical Products Depot products due to these factors."
3,buy XXL instead,"These shoe covers work great to protect your floors/surfaces. However, even the XL size does not cover the shoes of most of my male friends and family members. They work great for the women's shoes. You should go ahead and pay more for the next size up if you have any doubt."
1,XL = small,These supposedly XL shoe covers are really small- they can't be put on men's shoes over size 9. They're smaller than the regular size that I have which will cover most men's shoes.
4,Fits shoes from 7 to 13,The product does fit shoe sizes from 7 to 13 but must be put on so the white threaded seam is in front like a tongue on a shoe. Put the toe part of your shoe in first and we had no problem as some others complained about. If you put it on so the seam is in the back it will not fit large shoes.
2,Very Small,"These are extremely small for show covers. I have to rip these to fit over my men's size 9 1/2 sneakers. If I wore work boots, they would never fit."
3,What we bought a long time back did not look like the photo.,What we bought and received was a thin light blue slip on cover that fit over your shoe. It did not fit very tight and had a tendency to turn sideways or move excessively. Not bad but not great.
2,Not Anti Skid,"The covers are big enough to fit a size 12 men's shoe - you just have to stretch them to the limit. However, I do not recommend this product for those who have hardwood floors - they are not anti skid. This would be perfect for carpeted floors though."
3,A little on the small size,"These are fine for women's shoe, but it is a little on the small size for men shoes. Most contractors are men, so the size is problematic."
3,Disposable Shoe covers,"I bought these shoe covers so I could have contractors put them over their work shoes to protect my floors in a new house I was having various work done in. Unfortunately, the covers do not work well for covering a work shoe over 10"". They seem very durable but not very practical."
2,Size Problem,"One would think that size XL would indicate a shoe cover that could fit the average man and most women. However, this shoe cover barely fits a man wearing size 8 sneakers. If a male worker in your home is wearing bulky work shoes, this shoe cover will not fit over them. For women it will fit a size 40 (a woman's 9 & 1/2 size shoe) at most."
4,Good coverage,"I ordered these shoe coverings so that when I am mowing my lawn or working out in the gardens and need to come inside the house, I can use these to slip over my shoes to keep my carpet clean. I live in Houston and during the late spring, all summer, and early autumn, the temps and humidity are so high that when working outside, you need to come in often to cool off. It becomes quite an aggravation having to take my tie sneakers on and off several times. This is a perfect solution and saves my carpet. I also intend to use them when workmen need to come inside my home."
2,Disappointed but they work,"In this case, you get what you pay for. Very thin (more so than others I've used) but more problematic for me was the ""anti skid"" substance seemed completely ineffective. The bottom of the cover is colored in a pattern that looks like traction. In reality, this seemed to me to provide no grip whatsoever. Is there any grip? Maybe. The cover is sewn with a piece of rubber along the bottom center. As the thread which covers the rubber begins to wear off and before the rubber has worn off, that little strip can give you a little traction. Bottom line, depending on your needs it could work but the anti-skid claims seem deceptive/questionable. As to sizing, my size 10 mens fit in the XL no problem and a worker was able to get his large work boot (maybe size 12?) into it but very tight fit."
3,Ok,The book wasn't in as great as a condition as it stated. It was it was less than good condition and did not come with an access card like it stated.
1,Save your money,"This book does not tell you how to eliminate back and neck pain, it tells how good the author is and why you should see a chiropractor. The book fills with his patients' great testimonies, and chiropractic philosophy. Half of the book is under the Bonus Health Section which is a waste of time. Even the author advises you not to read if you know all you want to know by this time!"
2,Not as helpful as other material,"This text is not very helpful at all. I used it in my Interest Theory class and started to use it for Course 2 exam, but both times came out confused. Luckily, in school, I had a great professor who did not bother using it as a teaching tool, rather as a source for homework problems. He used his own material to actually teach us the concepts. As for studying for Course 2, you will do much better using one of the manuals, such as Actex or BPP.Still, it does provide some good explanations of concepts, if you can just figure out what it's saying. A bit wordy at times.. :-)"
2,Only good for practice problems,"This book is pretty awful. The only reason I give it two stars is because the practice problems themselves aren't bad. That being said, the text is awful at explaining concepts and doesn't clearly connect with the problems until you look up the answers."
4,"Good, but could be shorter. Only to study for SOA exam FM","This new edition has more exercises and, in general, better layout. BUT, it is poorly written. Kellison could have reviewed his methods to explain certain points which are a bit superficial or backed only with mathematics. Even though it has many references to real situations, they are far from being clear or helpful.In conclusion, it is a book for quick reference abount basic financial mathematics and to prepare an exam (SOA Exam FM in particular). Not more. My four starts are supported by that: if you buy this book, you should buy it ONLY to study for exam FM."
2,So So,"The book sells for astronomical price because SOA chooses it. It's simple and standard material and there's about half a million people in this country who qualifies to write. Unless somebody else pays for you, go for another book, or a simple study notes will do."
3,Patient and thourough but too dense for most,"This text has everything you could possibly want to know about present value, future value, annuities certain, bond amoritization and virtually any subject in mathematical finance. It's an excellent introduction to actuarial study and notation but is frankly too dense for the average reader. It throws one new symbol after another at you and if you want to make it through the text you have to gobble them all up.For an actuarial candidate the alternate text by Parmenter (Theory of Interest, Life Contingencies, and Pension Applications) offers a more manageble option and gives an introduction to higher level subject matter to boot."
4,good,"This is an informative show with good narration. The interviews are very relevant, as many involved are ex gang members."
4,Banish boredom and work out harder,"These videos are shot from the perspective of the skier, and include stunning scenery as well as on-screen incentives to increase your pace for each workout."
5,Celebrates a diversity of trees and plants,"In Arboretum America: A Philosophy Of The Forest, botanist, medical researcher, and agricultural expert, Diana Beresford-Kroeger celebrates a diversity of trees and plants including how they can counteract the effects of pollution and global warming; which native plants complement the ""bioplan""; how to plan them with ideas and tips; the medicinal uses trees and plants have had from the inception of aboriginal cultures down to the modern day, and so much more. Inviting, full-color photography by Christian H. Kroeger and an informative Foreword by Edward O. Wilson nicely embellish this informed and informative presentation which vibrantly reflects the Diana Beresford-Kroeger's love of nature and enduring passion for scientific inquisition. Arboretum America is an especially recommended addition to Ecological Studies reference collections and Botanical Studies supplemental reading lists."
5,Wonderful!!!,A very sweet story based on true life experiences. Artwork is skillfuly done. My kids love it as much as I do.
4,Great price for a good coffee,"At home in Italy my mom buys it and she is very happy with it, I use it in my barista coffee machine and does a good job, crema is on the light side but very flavorful I would definitely recommend it"
3,bad nozzel,The spray is good but the tube for spot spraying does not fit the spray head. if you whittle it down it blows out and you have to chase it down. The product is good but the extension tube sux.
4,Good Lubricant,I needed a dry spray with nozzle & past experience with 3M convinced me to buy. Worked great. Some have complained about nozzle fit but my sample worked great.
5,"Decent price, great product","If I could find a better price, then I would buy it there; but I haven't yet.Silicone lubricant spray is hard to find in my area, and I use it on a lot of applications. Antique firearms, door hinges, gears, bushings, car doors, tractor parts. You name it, this stuff probably will do the job.I sprayed some of this on my bedroom doors, and it has stayed 6 months with no further squeaking, and no drips or mess."
5,perfect for the window problem opening and closing,A contractor recommended this product for stuck windows and it worked great. The windows were 6 years old but sticking and difficult to open. Use of this product made it a lot easier.
1,Extension does not fit into the spray head.,"The extension tube is too fat to fit inside the spray head making the can unusable.Product may be OK, but what good is that if you cannot get the spray where you want it.I finally found a spray head from a ""canned air"" blaster and was able to put it on this can and apply the product.I will never buy this brand again."
1,Flammable,I got rid of it...too dangerous.I didn't realize how dangerous it can be.I am afraid to use it.I can't say how it works since I threw it out.
2,Twiztid,Not a very good release. Worst of the Cryptic Collections for sure. To bad the og version of Wrong With Me didn't make it. Twiztid needs to invest in some better beats and production. The Joker is kinda cool but gets old quick. Two stars because 2nd Hand Smoke is on it but seems like that's on every Twiztid special release.
5,Terrific History,"The book about Lewis and Clark's journey written and illustrated by Roz Schanzer is terrific. The children that I teach at Schiel Primary School love not only hearing the story, but also love the fabulous illustrations. Roz Schanzer is truly a gifted author and illustrator. I hope to see more work from her in the future."
3,Delivers PoE but you lose gigabit speed,"This product delivers Power over Ethernet. However, you will lose the ability to transfer at wired gigabit speed.My other switch has a dual color light to indicate whether the connected device is running at gigabit or not. Before, the switch lit up with a green light to indicate gigabit speed. After PoE was installed, the other switch shows as amber, indicating 100 mbps speed, not 1000 mbps.Not a problem for surfing the internet, but if you are streaming media through your house, you'll lament the drop from 1000 to 100 mbps. Hopefully, an updated model will come out that preserves the gigabit speed."
3,incorrect running time,"This is an interesting documentary, but the listed running time (120 minutes on amazon) is because it repeats itself. So the running time is one half of what's stated. I wasn't too happy with this one."
3,does the job,got to replace my 2nd glass out of bodum press. It sucks that a bit of glass has to cost so much. if this one breaks im buying a stainless press.If you're wondering yes it does work in the bodum 8 cup.
2,Quality Issue,"This would be the third beaker and it cracked again. Dangerous, I had rinsed the beaker with hot water first and then when pouring coffee heared a cracking sound. I rinsed beaker out and a large piece broke off.I have used this type of Coffee Pot in the UK and loved it. I have gonie through 3 beakers now and never had these problems in the UK. It is clearly a quality issue, which can be dangerous as mentioned above."
1,DOES NOT FIT BONJOUR CARAFE HANDLE,Does not fit my Bonjour 8 cup press pot handle. Seems to be good quality. Arrived quickly and well packaged.
3,Replacement for Bodum,"I bought this as a replacement glass for my Bodum french press. It fits but it's not quite as snug at the original was, so be careful when pouring or it will slide out of the metal brace. The price more than makes up for the imperfect fit."
5,FITS WELL!,"THIS REPLACEMENT BEAKER FITS ALL MY LA CAFETIERE PRESS POTS PERFECTLY. I HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL FROM TJMAXX OVER THE YEARS BUT ALWAYS MANAGE TO BREAK THEM. THIS IS A GOOD FIT, ALTHOUGH I CAN BUY THE COMPLETE PRESS ( INCLUDING THE BEAKER) BRAND NEW AT TJ MAXX FOR 13.99-16.99 MOST ANYTIME. THIS PRODUCT IS OVERPRICED IN MY OPINION BUT DOES FIT WELL AND AMAZON ALWAYS SEEMS TO HAVE THEM IN STOCK WHEN TJ MAXX DOES NOT. THANKS AMAZON!"
1,fragile,"This beaker was too tight to put in the frame, so we had to loosen the screws to insert the beaker into the frame. A few weeks later, I found it cracked."
4,perfect gift at a good price,I wanted to get my niece a prince doll to go with her (many) princess dolls. This was perfect and the price was very good.
2,a big letdown from Season 1,"The second season tends to meander around quite a bit at first and then picks up after several shows. But, the conclusion to the season is rather poor and very unsatisfying emotionally,. both for the main villain and the two detectives. the writers seemed to have run out of inspiration. I thought the first season was brilliant and was very much looking forward to season two. too bad, really."
3,Better but not great,"At least the diversity of sports used in this tape kept my attention and I did like some of the stories. I even learned some things that I didn't know about some sports luminaries. I wouldn't buy the tape again. Come on, Jack, get some humor in your stories and on the tape. Not everything has to be so serious."
3,Good but not as good as the first one,The fist chicken soup for the soul is a very good book. Almost all stories are inspiring and touching. In the chicken soup for the sports fan soul are a few good stories but also many others which did not match my expected quality.
3,More varied than their last collaboration.,"John Zorn and Yamataka Eye's ""Nani Nani II"" is in many ways a continuation of their previous album. Again, its primarily an ambient affair, but with a bit more variety and fire to it.Essentially, this is one long piece, working well as a coherent statement-- it moves through a number of moods, from Zorn screeching over electronic noise (""F***xotica"", ""Uffof"") to delicate, open performances where simple balances fill space nicely (""Hilo Himo"", ""Espimo"") to some almost straightforward work (the appropriately named ambient piece, ""Bartime with Eno"", ""4ab""). The album really covers a lot of territory and remains engaging throughout.Having stated this, I've listened to it no more than a handful of times since I got it-- its significantly better than ""Nani Nani"", but I still don't come back to it."
1,Unbelievable & poorly done,"This movie had a few promising moments up front, and then completely failed to deliver. The main premise is flawed. It is completely unbelievable that a movie industry professional (as portrayed in the film), who saved $250,000 in three years, could not raise $40,000 to finish his movie. Good grief! Just put it on the credit card! But all the smarmy groveling scenes just got to be too much. Very much a high school production. The ""twist"" ending lacked all effect, and was completely unbelievable. Waste of time."
1,Utterly pointless,"This is a mock-documentary, but unlike the Christopher Guest movies or ""This is Spinal Tap"", this movie is not meant to be funny. We're supposed to care about a total loser who is trying to get finishing funds for his crap movie that nobody likes. Every aspect of this movie is poorly done, even the narration sounds amateurish. I can't figure out what the filmmakers had in mind with this. I had heard about it getting lots of attention when it showed on IFC. Now I know why: the movie is a big cheat. It tries to seem ""real"" and has what would be a very tragic ending, if it actually happened. But it didn't happen, none of it happened. Imagine the ""Blair Witch Project"" but without the scares. There are so many real documentaries about filmmaking that I can't imagine why anyone would waste their time with this."
4,Even Though Out-Of-Date - The Book Is Still Valuable,"This book is still valuable even though it is out-of-date because it contains the phone numbers of many of the nonprofit organizations, mostly libraries, that sponsor used book sales throughout America. All book sales are sponsored by nonprofit groups and range in size from a few hundred to over 300,000. In addition to the phone numbers and addresses of the organizations, the book provides the time of year (usually once or twice per year) that the sales take place. These times are fairly consistent from year to year."
3,Don't take it so seriously,"This is intended as a jokey gift book, not a style manual, so if you're looking for the latter this isn't it. It is a very light read, agreed, and yes, it's from a British publisher and a British perspective. But if you want a small, glossy present for a wannabe friend, or just want something stylish to keep in your bathroom, this isn't a bad choice."
3,cofee table fashion,"this is not a terrible choice of a style guide for those looking for a classic movie star icon sort of style. it is excellent for bathroom decor and can serve as a beginning for someone looking to cutivate a style similiar to audrey hepburn, grace kelley, jackie o, or marilyn monroe. a word of caution, it is written in a very brittish vernacular."
4,Good read,"This is a very good style source. One caveat. It's a British publication written in ""British"" English. Can be difficult at times for U.S. readers(e.g. ""trainers"" = sneakers)to plow through."
3,What the...,"The first thirteen episodes were sublime. A few of those that follow never really reach the excellence and craftmanship of the beginning of this series, and most of those 'few' are on this DVD. Episodes 21-23 are found here, and the last two seem soooo out of place it may have been best to leave them off (particularly the surreal and nonsensical mushroom/zombie/meteor episode).The first thirteen episodes command 5 stars. These weird-arse episodes (#22 and partially #23) are almost the so-called 'jump the shark' moments, but at least the baseball one is still fun to watch. Episodes 22-23 are so far removed from the rest of the series that, as long as you're aware of this simple fact, you should watch them anyway. Then make up your own mind."
4,Vol 6 you know you need it!,"If your a fan of the series then you probably don't need me to tell you that you need this one to complete the series. This volume has important things going on in the beginning but the last episodes in the volume nothing important goes on and its just filler episodes. That said one of the fillers is a little wierd leaving you with a ""wtf?"" face and the other filler is about good ole baseball FUNNIEST EPISODE i've seen in the series. If you like the series and like comedy that baseball episode is worth it all and oh yea the good story episodes in the beginning."
3,Ahhhh Samurai Champloo,Pretty much a filler disk (other than the first which is a follow up to the previous episode). No doubt if your a fan of the series i say buy it. Yet it really holds no true value or missing pieces to the series as whole.
5,I suggest,"This is of course a neccessity for anyone collecting this series. At this time I own volumes 1,2, and 6. The reason I bought 6 out of order is because I found it at a Hot Topic in the Houston Galleria mall at 50% off, so I only payed like 13 dollars. Whats more is that it came with a special limited edition tin case, which is red and black, and illustrates a masked samurai. Under the samurai it reads ""Samurai Champloo"". I found the tin case to be entirely useless (I keep all my DVDs lined up like books), but it gives my Samurai Champloo collection an extra kick. Take that!! any fan that doesn't have the tin case. So I suggest you check out your local mall ASAP, you might just find one."
2,Filler?,"This disk was mega-weak; a three episode disc beginning with the abrupt, dumb conclusion to a story that started very promisingly, followed by two of the most unashamed pieces of filler I've ever seen.The first part of ""Elegy of Entrapment"" was amazing, start to finish. The music was heartrending and the story was deep and nuanced. The second part was just a series of lame ""I think he's dead"" moments and lamer fights.The zombie/ghost/mushroom whatever story and the baseball episodes were so completely extraneous and awful. I generally love this series, but these eps were just bad.Also, I'm a bit narked at the 3 episode disc- It's only about an hour of content, with 2/3's of it being wholly unneccesary. I would have just cut the baseball and zombies and gone straight to the concluding episodes. I guess Geneon is in business to make money and so forth, I just feel cheated.In a nutshell: this is a totally skippable disc in an otherwise excellent series."
3,UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE,"WELL MADE; HOWEVER, SOMEWHAT SHALLOW. COPARED WITH MOVIES LIKE ""PRIDE & PREJUDICE"" FOR EXAMPLE, WHICH CAN BE VIEWED MANY TIMES, THIS ONE, MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE."
2,There are better Productions out there to Watch and Enjoy,The production was not at all enjoyable.I purchased this DVD as Keeley Hawes was in it. I have enjoyed her in Our Mutual Friend and Wives and Daughters. Keeley does a fine job.However this production lacks a good story line with character development.I am all for light hearted productions but this one just did not do it for me.There are far more better BBC Productions out there to watch and enjoy.
2,Tedious,"An annoying film that is hard to sit through. It clobbers you over the head trying to get across certain points like the change in seasons and Dewey's ""love at first sight"" reaction to Fancy. There is a complete lack of chemistry between Fancy and Dewey, who are two unlikeable characters. They are too immature to be in a relationship, much less married judging by the amount of pretended indifference, miscommunication, and melodrama they inflict upon each other. I couldn't have cared less if they ended up together. The musical score was obtrusive and repetitive."
2,Not the usual good period DVD,I have now tried to watch this twice and still haven't made it through it one full time. It is so boring and the musical score is enough to make one quit watching it also. It was more irritating than the movie itself.
2,A little boring,"Again, I watched this film with my sister, since we both enjoy period films. We found it a bit boring, but sweet none the less. Thanks"
2,Disappointing,"As an avid fan of BBC period drama I ordered 'Under the Greenwood Tree' based on the comments made by displacedhuman (""delightful adaptation"") and randomartco (""delightful gem"") in their reviews. Given these comments, I was expecting something of the quality of 'Persuasion', 'Wives and Daughters', 'Silas Marner', or 'The Black Velvet Gown'.Instead what I got was clumsy directing, cloying performances (despite a good cast), and a jerky plot - more of a production for children than adults. And to add insult to injury, the pretentious theme music was a continual annoyance.While I would have loved to be delighted, I'm afraid I was merely disappointed.(And if there's any honour among reviewers, displacedhuman and randomartco will each send me half of the purchase price... )"
1,Not Entertaining At All,"Product did not meet my expectations but arrived in a timely fashion. Very happy with both shipment and service, just not the product. I do not ecommend this to customers for a future purchase."
3,"Not a masterpiece, but very enjoyable","I am a sucker for BBC's adaptations of 19th century novels. Though I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, this one was not disappointing. It's a sweet and simple story, the characters are interesting, though not well-developed, and the love story is nice. Nothing earth-shattering, and no big surprises, but thoroughly enjoyable."
5,Favorite Story of All Time,I purchased these items on DVD to replace items taped off PBS years previously. They were excellent then and are equally interesting now.
5,What a Wonderful Movie,"What a gentle, fresh movie. I was expecting a below average English period movie; I judged that it would be below par because of an uninspiring cover. But I was wrong.This movie is a refreshing treat. The casting is perfect, the music is lovely and appropriate, from Christmas carol to Church music to ballad sung in the street. The screenplay has just the right touches of humor.I highly recommend this movie."
4,Under the Greenwood Tree,Very romantic and entertaining film. The movie is set in a rural town in England in the 1840's just prior to industrialization. The characters are so enjoyable and refreshingly original. You'll enjoy it.
4,"Not a ""bad"" movie",The story line was a typical love story. I didn't recall any bad language or mild language but one of the main characters did have his shirt off a few times I believe in the movie. There was some sexual conduct as well so because of these two things I would not consider it a family movie.
3,Nice,"I enjoyed the movie - the dance scene was great showing the contrast between the classes. However, the movie lacked a little spark and is not one I would really want to see again."
2,bad bulb,I received the order for 6 bulbs. The first one I put in blew immediately. I replaced it and it seems to be working now. Only time will tell whether this is a good deal. Say 20000 hours. I will let you know if it lasts 10 years.
3,The jury is still out,"Bulbs are sold in a package of 6. First bulb lasted about 20 hours before it burned out. Bulbs are rated for 20k hours. Hopefully the rest of the pack will live up to the claim of ~15k-20k hours. If not, I will add a follow on post."
2,Not to be Used Outside,"Thanks to the government on reducing wattage for incandescent bulbs for outside usage, I searched online for a 100 watt heavy duty bulb for my outside poll light. I used to buy 100 heavy duty bulbs at Menards which would last 6 months to a year. Menards has dropped the 100 watt for 60 watts now. I need the extra illumination for my long dirveway.I bought these based on the specs I read on the website. I installed the 100 watt bulb which lasted lest than three days. The bulb exploded in the light head fixture. I replaced the bulb and the same thing happened to the second bulb. Even though my light head fixture is sealed, my guess is that condensation or moisture is causing the bulbs to burst. I called the manufacturer to resolve the problem. His only solution was to reimburse me.I am now using a 100 watt CFL bulb, even though it is not as attractive as the crystal clear bulbs, I have had no problems with my light polls lighting up my driveway."
2,Interesting,"I bought a six pack of these clear light bulbs to use in outdoor decorative fixtures. I was impressed with their construction especially the filament and supports so I replaced two out of three lights surrounding double garage doors. One blew after a day so the other five will need to last 23,998 hours to break even.The interesting feature is that the light - compared to the normal 100 watt clear bulb that was in the third fixture - is much dimmer and a yellow/brown color. OK, I suppose, to use outdoors but you will have to replace all the lights visible at a time because the difference between these and regular clear is very dramatic. Don't think I will use them indoors or order them again."
2,Horrible. Very little light.,"Hard to believe these are 100 watt bulbs. I assume the 100 watts was measured at a voltage higher than normal household voltage. Next to a normal 100 watt bulb, it looks like 40-60 watts. I guess these are the answer to the limitation in the US on sales of 100 watt incandescent bulbs. You might as well just buy a proper low wattage bulb."
2,Not a good start,"I purchased 12 of the 96001 Decorative Chandelier Bulbs rated at 9000 Hours plus some ULA-22 types hoping for long life bulbs for some hard to reach places. I installed 8 96001s and 2 of those burned out within 24 hours. Looks like a gas leakage based on the discoloring of the bulb's glass. They claim to be the ""only manufacturer of 20,000 hour rated, long-life incandescent bulbs left in America today"" which may be true but the 9,000 hour 96001s boxes I received are clearly stamped ""Made in China"" and the infant mortality rate isn't good. On their site there's a small, not very obvious link that says ""imported"" by these but clicking it doesn't give any info. Don't like companies that aren't upfront or hide details.They did refund my money for the 2 burned out bulbs (not any of the shipping) but I'm skeptical of how long they'll last. The other 8 96001s have been running roughly 90 days at 8-10 hours per day without more failures. The jury is still out on these."
2,Dim and yellow,Not impressed. So far it is still lite but not near as bright as other 100w bulbs. More like a 75w or a 60w. Also color is very yellow. I will not be buying again.
3,really good for bare beginners,"This dvd is very simplified and easy for anyone, especially someone with any dance experience. If you are a true beginner in dance, this is the dvd for you. However, if you have experience in it, unless you want to tune up the basics, I think you will be left bored as I was. I could hardly get through the video. But this lady is very good at slowly explaining all the steps and showing you them all at different angles.It goes over feet placement: how to bend your knees, roll your hips, pelvic moments, taps, points, chasses, grapevine, turns, walks, and swivels. There is a beginning level and an intermediate level, both with demonstrations at the end of all the movements put together with music playing.Again, if you know nothing about dance, this is the dvd for you."
3,Very Basic Dance Video,"This video is very basic, starting with stepping in place and throwing in a bit of grape vine, etc. in the later steps. If you don't know anything about stepping or moving this may be helpful, though if I saw the instructor in a nightclub dancing the way she does on this video I may laugh out loud."
4,Love Love Love!,"These kicks are exactly what i needed, they are light, flexible, and provide cushion for the foot. I would definately recommend these sneaks to a runner like me :)"
2,sounded great but isn't,"The description for this product sounded much better than what you actually receive. My 11 year old son is very interested in car design but this was a big disappointment. Not only was the product somewhat misrepresented but: the activities were aimed at a very young level (Not 7 yrs to 99); the expert level was the worst of all; way too much packageing (also misleading). Great idea but not advertized accurately. Don't buy it unless your child is under 8, even then its too much money for what you receive."
5,A Major Hottie-Hot-Hottie!,"I love his cute brown hair! He reminds me of Bryce. Iden has super-cute blue eyes! He's totally a Prince Charming! He has ROYALLY RIVETING clothes. His accesories are amazing. He has a whistle necklace, comb, and cool-ectible card! You be glad 2 get this doll! I know I will. Prince Iden is quite a catch! L8er!~M.B.My Scene RULES!BRATZ RULEZ!BOTH RULE!end the war"
4,"Iden, the seventh Bratz Boy.","I personally do not have him,and I don't know where they sell him but I do know who his BF is: Kiani from bratz sisterz they can even be a couple naw I'm just kiddin' but they should be BF's though."
4,Insightful!,"Even if you're not a team player, this book will draft you in the first round. In plain language, author Gail Evans outlines the corporate playing field. She clearly marks the opponents, the cheerleaders and the goals women must conquer to score points in the corporate game. The book is at its best when Evans uses real-life examples to demonstrate the dramas, the discrimination and the disadvantages women face while working. Like a video of game highlights and lowlights, her examples are pulled from the pages of her own agenda book and e-mail box. She provides concrete tips to tell women how to establish and cultivate formal and informal networks. Although she does address the tug-of-war women survive while balancing home and work commitments, the book could have scored more points on the home front. Maybe Evans will do that for us next time - meanwhile, we recommend this book to women on all rungs of the corporate ladder."
3,Women helping women,"Very interesting take from Gail Evans on how women in corporate world should help each other. Her premise in this book is that we (women) still operate as individuals instead of teams. Women need to attend more power lunches where not only family and tennis lessons can be discussed, but business deals can be made too. In some instances, Ms. Evans is stretching the idea of every woman, helping every woman. Personally, I will help any person, regardless of their gender, if I see professional potential in them, humanity and humility in their behavior. Helping any woman regardless of their abilities just for the sake that there are a woman is a bit too much for me to accept. In general, I like helping people who will show gratitude and loyalty of some sort. In my opinion, that is the only way one can create a following and build successful teams and organizations."
3,Good design but with a flaw,"The product has 2 parts, 1 : The upper portion, covers the display. The lower portion, covers the key-pad. You have to slide in the OPENED phone from top, with the key-pad cover sliding in first and then close the phone, i.e. slide in the display, with goes into the display cover.Problem: The key-pad cover slightly touches some internal part of the display (back) side causing it to warp up and many times have a problem closing it. All in all, a good product, in the sense the leather quality is durable, the plastic covering is not to hard and the belt-clip slides off/on easily. There's 2 holes behind for the camera+attenna, but you've to physically move them slightly to have proper clear view, if camera is used."
2,"only ok, not worth it","This case looks great on the outside, but on the inside where the caliper lays the cut out wasn't long enough for the caliper to fit in!! Now in the product description it says my caliper will fit just fine, but I had to cut out about a 1/2"" of hard dense foam to get my caliper to lay in it correctly. Also as a side note, I bought this case because I thought the caliper that I bought from Amazon (starrett 1202-6) didn't come with a protective case, but it does. So you don't have to go out and buy this case which is not any better at protecting the caliper than the case that came with my caliper for free. I wouldn't buy this again."
3,Used is the new New!,"I really enjoy all three of those movies and I was excited when I saw that there was a DVD set. The only problem I have been having is with only one DVD, French Kiss. It dose not play very well on my computer but on a regular DVD player it's fine, so no worries! Thanks!"
5,one of my favorites,This was my first introduction to the series by Jon Kirvan. It is still my favorite. Excellent for introductions to some of the world's greatest mystics with wonderful reflections and prayers. Beautiful for personal spiritual growth or for use with a group of like-minded spiritual journeyers.
2,Still Hungry,"The premise of ""God Hunger: Discovering the Mystic in All of Us"" -- that at the root of all our longing is a profound hunger for God -- is provocative. But author John Kirvan fails in his task to stay focused and to satisfy our hunger. The problem with this book is, I think, its rootlessness. Taking an ecumenical approach to Western spirituality, with sources as diverse as C.S. Lewis, Rumi, the Kabbalah, and Hildegard of Bingen, the book fails to fulfill. Particularly disappointing were the prayers, which at times bordered on the incomprehensible."
1,Dog Days -- Life Sucks and then You Die,This was supposedly a family movie. It was awful! Yuck! The idea seemed to be that everyone has a dark side but there's no redemption for that darkness. There was no resolution to all the badness and there were no likeable characters. The only attempt at resolution was when the lead character returned to his hometown and had a weird psychological experience. He basically had to accept that life sucks and learn not to hate in spite of that. Apparently he was helped in accepting the darkness of life by believing in a B grade monster. It was really dumb. I was disappointed that the Dove foundation put their label on it. I hope no one else wastes their time watching it.
2,movie,"Movie was not great. It was slow getting to the point and was a downer when it got there. I bought this movie for the great footage because it was filmed in Edenton, NC and I was there in the park the day the 4th of July scene was filmed, and myself, my son, and many friends are shown in the film as extras. I expected it to be an uplifting story about a great summer in the beautiful NC coast...it was not.It was dark and dreary. booo"
5,Very compelling!,"This movie is extremely moving! You will experience highs and lows in emotion. Finally a movie with values, real purpose and a strong moral of the story! Loved it! This is a perfect gift idea!"
3,Dog Days of Summer,"This is a good small town movie, most of which was shot in Edenton, NC. The main reason I like it is because I live in Edenton. It's also a good mystery."
2,Woops!,"I bought this book thinking it was quotes from the movie. Instead they were thoughts from the author. If your looking for a book that are direct quotes from the movie, keep looking. This is not it. Some funny one-liners but that's it."
5,Wow! What a book.,"For anyone whose looking for a dramedy book, here it is. Even if you've seen the movie the book will still make you laugh. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who is not reading as much as they would like to and want to start on a great book."
1,Kurt Adler M&M Red Nutcracker,"This product was not the best quality. The ""M"" below the mouth is a piece of paper that is flimsy, bent and wrinkled. You can see where the arms are glued into the body. The hat is crooked. And the clear plastic on the box was coming open."
4,Informative and Entertaining,"He may not be Reischauer but Mr. De Mente packs enough cultural and historical background into this book to make it a worthy read for Japanese scholars or anyone with an interest in Japan. The author presents the reader with about 150 Japanese words and phrases that have special meaning for the Japanese. For example, he translates the word ""kamatoto"" into English as ""The Dumb Blonde"" i.e the Japanese propensity to feign innocence in order to gain the upper hand in a relationship or business deal. ""Wa"" or ""harmony"" is succinctly though brilliantly explained and would be something any foreign businessperson dealing with Japan should appreciate. I have read other books by Mr. De Mente but this is by far his most informative and well written. Recommended!"
2,Boring,"As a serious language learner I thought it would be about phrases that are uniquely Japanese. Instead it was a collection of trite stereotypes that have been repeated over and over and frankly don't really represent the modern country that much. Most of the rest is simple stuff that only someone who started learning about the Japanese culture a week ago would not already know.There are a few things that most people will probably find interesting, but it's not worth spending money on. Get it at the library if you must, but only buy it if you have extra spending money you feel like wasting. I checked it out from the library myself, and it was barely worth the time I spent to read it."
3,A good basic guide,... but a little dated for 2013. Also repetitive; less text for repeating concepts introduced early on and more explanation of current cultural trends would be useful.
2,It’s a bit dry.,"This book reads very much like a college sociology or anthropology book. I bought it to broaden my understanding of marshal arts customs, tradition and culture and so far have been disappointed and found nothing useful to that degree. The book might be good for people interested in doing business in a Japanese culture however. It’s a bit dry."
3,"Good book, slow read, very educational on Japanese culture","This book has been by my nightstand for almost 2 years now. I read a little bit each time. I am very interested in Japanese culture and if that is where your interest lies, culture and history of this rich unique country, then you will enjoy this book. Each phrase and expression is analyzed and broken down into its very roots as well as the current usage. I like what I have read so far, but hardly see myself finishing it any day soon :)!"
4,The Scientist,"I bought this as a toy for my granddaughter. She has a real one at home, but for my house she wanted one to play with. This was the cheapest one I found for her just to play with. She is 7 yrs. old and loves to pretend she is a scientist. She uses it for looking at her candy and snacks or any other substance I let her have. She seems to really like it, so I guess it serves the purpose."
4,George reviews Madea,This play continues the excellent pattern of Tyler Perry productions. It gives us humor - a lot of it - punctuated with life lessons and spiritual insights.
3,A Bit Disappointed,"Everyone has they're own opinion and I see that many people truly enjoyed this play. But, for some reason I didn't particularly like this one, that much. Maybe it's me, but I still love Tyler Perry, but this one didn't do much for me."
4,Not his best but still good,"This was as someone else said a ""typical Tyler Perry,"" play. Like all of his plays the overwhelming theme is forgiveness and letting go. And just like in some of his earlier plays, you will experience samplings of some old school jams, even Tyler sings a few notes.The play was good, but not as funny as some of his other plays. The chemistry between Brown and Madea is what made the plays funny to me. When I was watching it, I was expecting Brown or some form of him to come across the screen. I just felt like something was missing."
4,Big Happy Family –the Play,"When I first heard about this play coming out on DVD, I simply waited for it. As I have stated before, I trust Tyler Perry and I enjoyed the play also. I do have a hard time finding words to write a review and after I write one I really don't appreciate a program giving me weird messages.I checked into your tips and guidelines, and there is nothing that tells you what to do when the submission button remains grayed out. So will probably not get a review on this one. End. ...................... .......................... .......................... .............................. ........................... ......................... .......................... ..........................."
5,Madea's Big Happy Family,"I went to see the play at Madison Square Garden and loved it. I had a great time, TP knows just how to combine comedy while being serious all at the same time. I am a huge Tyler Perry fan and I just had to have the dvd"
1,Not worth the cash,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! This is not worth the cash if you get it for free toss it, it's not worth your time. Its like a parody of every play he's ever done in the past. Tyler's plays are usually so uplifting and this just made me want to put a magnum to my head and pull the trigger. I couldn't even watch it all, I watched 75% of it. But that was all my patient ass could take. What's worse I spent 12.99 on the DVD which is now permanently in my collection as a constant reminder that I should have paid like what? No more than $4 to watch the shiz on Amazon Demand to see that it was complete shiz, at least then I could have saved myself $8."
4,Surprise! A good moral message,"This was my first Madea movie and I was delightfully surprised. I was originally hoping to watch it with my ""8"" + ""10"" year olds, but they will be in their teens before they are ready to see it. Some scenes were difficult and painful to watch, but what a good message! I highly recommend it! Madea puts her family first as well as others in need. She has amazing insight as to what is going on with her family members and the advice they need, she delivers it in a way that you couldn't help but accept and put into action as you will see toward the victorious end! It definitely has inappropriate comments and actions, but the good moral message wins out! Go Madea!"
1,NOT GOOD AT ALL,The only good thing about this play was the two boys singing even me. And Aunt Bam singing tonight is the night. Didnt like it at all.
4,My favorite Tyler Perry play much better than the movie,"The play is more cohesive than the movie by the same name. I am a fan of Tyler perry but I get frustrated with some of his work. Not this one I saw this play in person, I laughed and cried. I was glad to get the DVD so that I could share it with my children. It was silly and over the top at times but also humorous and inspirational."
5,Pam in Va,Loved it. Tyler Perry did not disappoint! I love all of the Madea movies. I have invited friends over for lunch just to watch it. I and my family have watch it over and over again. Very funny!
5,"Love, Love, Love this!","Tyler Perry has done it again, ya'll! This is the funniest one yet, Madea actually lays hands on someone in this. This play will make you laugh and cry. The song sung at the mother's funeral will bring tears to your eyes. I can tell you that there is a Madea in virtually every African American (and Afro-Caribbean family) and Tyler Perry portrays her to perfection. Please order this DVD, you will NOT be disappointed."
5,Arguably The Best Tyler Perry Play Yet,"This play is just as funny and as Madea Goes To Jail, Diary Of A Mad Black Woman and any other one. Tyler Perry sets the record straight for all the people that criticize him for playing as Madea. One thing I loved about the play is he teaches the simple aspect of love."
3,Too dreary,This play was sad and there wasn't enough laughing to make up for how sad the play leaves you feeling afterwards. There is too much time spent on singing and talking. Maybe plays/musicals just aren't my thing. Do not get it twisted though..Tyler Perry's work in his movies and T.V. shows are AMAZING and I love them ALL!
5,Tyler Perry's best work yet!,This made me laugh and cry! It is also full of Madea's wisdom. Someday I hope to see one of his plays onstage. Excellent actors and singing.
4,Madea's Big Happy Family:,"I thought it was more straight to the point than most of the plays' he has done in the past.But never the less funny,sad, and just makes you think about how life is just to short to hold on to the madness!"
5,outstanding,omy is can he get any better i dont know what i will do . he is alsome . and he keep them coming...
4,Madea's Big Happy Family,"I just want to know is there a soundtrack to this play . . .Please can someone tell me the name of that song that ""Joyce"" sings when she make her cross over into heaven ... I think it might be ""Heaven Waits For Me"" . . whatever the name of that song the character ""Joyce"" sung that song up to heaven . . I could not even finish watching the play for rewinding the dvd over and over . . My Goodness . .. ."
5,Madea's Big Happy Family,My youngest daughter wanted this one since she was not able to attend the play with us. She describes it as classic Tyler.
5,Tyler does it again!,Such a very heartfelt story with a funny spin to it. The acting and the singing is soooooo good! I hop there is more to come.
3,Madea's Big Happy Family,"Being that Tyler Perry is one of my favorites, I purchased this play as a gift for a family member. The video plays fine once we discovered that we had to change the region to get it to play. Alway it does not play on older VCR's."
5,Checkpoint,"This play by Tyler Perry was awesome and very powerful, it is a must have in my movie collection.Madea's Big Happy Family: The Play"
3,Madea's Big Happy Family,"This DVD was not in the best condition when it arrived. I had to clean it to play it. At first it was skipping and showing images digital, but once cleaned it played alright. I have not tried to play it again to see if is alright. This is the first time I have ever received a DVD that was not in very good shape. I will continue to order DVD's I like from Amazon, it is a great place to increase your DVD collection at a very reasonable cost."
3,Middle of the Road,"Typical Tyler Perry play, but he always makes us laugh. The middle was sad when the mom died and her song was way too long. Still, I would watch it again."
3,Plastic tree,"This was I felt a decent movie; with tension clearly demonstrated amoung the 3 main charecters, with a surprise ending."
5,Visually stunning!,"Max Lucado has another book that shines! Wonderful parallels from scripture we all can understand and relate to. We all need to give, love, and forgive more and this story provides us with some great examples. Douglas Klauba's artwork beautifully compliments Max's latest endeavor. Our hearts are stired visually as we read along. With masterful use of composition, color, and design and characters with great emotion and expression, he leaves a lasting impression upon the reader. Looking forward to see what he illustrates next. Thank you both, for producing a vivid, thought provoking, stunningly illustrated book."
2,Childhood favorite marred by homophobia,"This was an instructive encyclopedia of the horror genre as I was growing up, but looking back over the review of 'Teenagers from Outer Space', author Naha uses an anti-gay epitet to describe a character. This casual contempt for homosexuals dates the book and alienates an audience often attracted to the subject matter. The many photos and humorous tone of the book are assets. Unfortunately, I can't recommend the book except for people willing to judge it from its unenlightened historic perspective."
1,Does not work for all animals,"I know this product works well for so many pets, but just be advised it is not always effective. After consulting my vet, used this for over a month with my 17-year old cat and unfortunately his blood panel returned slightly worse results - not likely from using this product, but because his disease is progressing and the product did not affect him in the way we had hoped. After introducing this into his diet, he also began having significant diarrhea. Hope you have better results if you choose this product."
5,Great for Getting into Screen Printing,Great starter kit for anybody interested in learning how to screen print. The included DVD goes through the techniques and shows you exactly how its done. Very informative.Speedball products are obviously quality products and i would reccomend this kit to any beginner.
2,Slightly defective base unit,"We were immediately halted in our printmaking process by the fact that the base unit's wooden top bar (which the hinges get screwed on to) isn't even, one end is shorter than the other, so when attached with the hinge the screen won't lay flat against the base board.The kit was a great price, but not so great a price if we count out the base unit, which was really the main motivator to buy the kit instead of individual supplies. Ah well, bad luck for us."
1,"Do NOT buy, poor packaging ruins this product.","I saw some of the reviews saying containers came open on this product in shipping.Well, that's because Speedball skimps on packaging so much that it's almost guaranteed to.2 of the 5 containers of inks are coating everything inside of the box. The bottles of liquids to treat the screen have coated the screen, making it useless. The tissue papers & instruction book are stuck together with liquids.The tissue papers have MILDEWED, telling me that this happened early on after assembly.This is an unacceptable way to package a product & the product should be removed from Amazon until this is improved.Since this is supposed to be a ""Get started today!"" kit & that's sure not happening, definitely pass this kit up. You will be covered in ink & cranky the second you take the lid off."
1,Poorly Packaged,"When I opened the package some of the containers inside did not stay in their position. No big deal, but the photo emulsion remover bottle leaked. If there was no additional damage I would have kept it. What I believe was the tracing paper inside was half turned yellowish as well as the screen to make the ""negative"". Shipping was free through Prime thankfully. So I will return and probably try to purchase another since other good reviews."
5,This is a fantastic book to look into for information!,This book is one of the books that you should really read. It contains tons of information about Eleanor Roosevelt. I had to write a biography about her for a project at school and I aced it! This book had lots of pictures too. I could not put it down!
4,Daughter enjoyed it.,My daughter had to write a report on the first lady and this book worked quite well. Well written book.
5,the real deal!!!!!,"this is the best cd of 2004 without a doubt!single bullet theory is the most intense and talented band to come along since the mike howe days of metal church,check this band out you will not be disappointed!!"
1,Misleading,"The cross looks petite and pretty, but it is HUGE! So big it looks tacky. I sent mine back. Amazon should have given measurements of the cross!"
4,nice and easy read,I really enjoyed this book it was mellow w/a twist of drama. I enjoyed the characters and the entire storyline was pretty good. I think anyone could enjoy this book!
3,Learning To Trust Again,"Secrets Never Told tells of two generations of families with epeated histories of marriage problems. Through out the book, ach of the marriages goes into the brinks of destruction but in he end it always remains in tact. The beginning of the story was low, but as the story continues, it becomes more interesting and suspenseful.Morgana and Erick are the two main character of Secrets Never Told and the story tells of how each of them must learn to live and love again while dealing with the decisions that have to be made. The events of the past take a turn for the worst leading into an eventful story full of past events that causes turbulence in Morgana's life."
3,This one surprised me...,"I love Mark Farina but I have to say that this is not his best mix in this series. I can't put my finger on it, but I was bored by this one. I kept playing it and playing, trying to catch a hook but nothing happened. I wound up giving this one away to someone who also was not impressed with this installment. Sorry Mark, but I still love ya and I'm still 'Connected'."
5,Easy listening hip hop instrumental,"If your a fan of underground hip hop instrumental without all that bling bling hype, then you need to pick up this album."
4,TV Series Wins!,"This book is entertaining and well written. You can see how the TV Series picked an individual thought out of the book to make an episode but don't look for chapters that co-inside with the series. Actually, the theme of the book is based around hikers who Ben Nevis absolutely despises and proceeds to capture them on his land and immediately locks them up in his dungeon. After releasing them, the hikers union plan and execute capturing Ben Nevis and locking him up until he signs an agreement to allow the union to camp and hike on his land. The story is funny and in its self would have made an excellent episode. I still prefer the TV series."
5,A good holiday read!,I started with the TV version (BBC America) and found the book different -- and funnier.
2,The Monarch of the Glen,"Boring, boring, boring!! After watching the television series I'm spoiled. This tedious, wordy tome was actually distasteful. I couldn't even get through 1/2 of the first chapter."
5,In the elite top-five books ever,This book amazes me. It definitly was a solvent on my life. It is a book whose world will accompany me forever. I don't know why I liked except to say that it connected me to something and was beautiful and funny.
5,I recommend this to everyone!,"I first heard of this book on the happyrobot.net site. This wonderful book starts with a selfish but valid love and ends with understanding of the world. I absolutely count this book in my favorites. I love the imagery, the setting, everything. My very favorite image that I retained is that of the buddhist monk juxtaposed with modern Amsterdam. Sheer beauty."
4,Home Town Music,"Mike Breen's songs are wonderful scenes of real life, touching and powerful, as in Great Wall of China. After listening to this CD I felt like I knew Mike's family and friends. Juanita's in love is great, so is Harbor Lights. The simple and elegant acoustic music that accompanies the songs is just beautiful. This is a collection that is good for quiet moments and for real listening."
4,sparks the imagination,I bought 2 of these for my granddaughter's. When they arrived I thought they were cute but wasn't sure what they could play with them. They knew better than me though.The dining room was turned into fairyland and they had so much fun playing fairies for the entire afternoon. These dolls seemed to really spark their imaginations and do everytime they come to visit grandma. The wings are fragile but they don't seem to mind. A cute doll for the price.
5,Pink Sparkle Fairy Topia Barbie,The new fairy topia Barbie is beautiful. My 3 year old daughter fell in love with this barbie from the tv commerical. This is a creative new doll in the Barbie series.
2,Wings are way too fragile.,"My 8-year-old bought this fairy with her own money -- and during her first play session, one of the wings bent when she put the doll down on its back. As she tried to straighten it, the plastic nearly broke in two, but enough stayed attached that I was able to superglue it together. The break is on the main branch of the wing, so if it breaks completely through the whole wing will fall off.She hasn't played with the doll since, as she can see the glue isn't holding great & just doesn't want to deal with ""breaking"" it again.It is a very pretty doll, but the wings need to be more substantial. Maybe the more expensive fairies in this line are better made, but I don't want to spend the money to find out."
1,"""!!!THIS TOY STINKS ON ICE!!!""","this doll broke the first day i got it, the head,leggs and arms came out. and when i washed her hair my hands turned pink!!!"
3,As described.,As described. Bulb worked perfectly and was packaged safely. My only complaint is that the bulb price seems high. I have remote strobes where the bulbs are cheaper.
3,Not quite as expected.,"After having listened to the tape that came with an old Juiceman, I thought this series would have far more information, but the tapes are shorter and much of it was a repeat of the one I had. There is some new info, but not as much as expected after having listened to the other one so many times."
3,Letters to the Clergy,"Mother Louise Margaret Claret de la Touche sets forth the doctrine of ""God the Infinite Love"" as taught her by Our Lord Himself. As a sister in a Visitation monastery she questioned how she could accomplish the task of conveying the Lord's message to the clergy of the world. The sisters were expelled from France and found a home in Italy. While in all this turmoil the sisters elected Mother Louise Margaret as Reverend Mother though she was one of the youngest in the community. With this appointment she was ""able"" to carry out the task. The Infinite Love explains the special love that the Lord has for his priests~His brothers who act as intermediaries between God and man. Much is expected of the soul given the vocation of the priesthood."
4,barbie,"its a barbie doll. theres nothing fancy about it. but if your little girl loves superheroes, its a must. electra is hard to come by, and this doll is great."
1,Poor quality,"Michael Parks has a wonderful voice. This CD is very poor quality. Often the music ""over rides"" his voice. I had the original LP and that was not the case on the record. Bought this for a gift and was very disappointed."
5,One of the best black metal albums of all time.,"This album is simply amazing. The fuzzy guitar tone is off the wall and sounds much better then almost all other black metal guitar tones. The keyboards play a great role in this album and create some amazing melodies. Check out the last track, it is probably the most uplifting sounding black metal song I have ever heard. It is very repetitive and keyboard based but works amazingly great. The other songs are more guitar based but still have great keyboards to compliment the guitars. Overall, this is one of my top favorite black metal albums of all time, and must be checked out by any fan of the genre. Ignore the other guys 3 star rating, this cd is a pure masterpiece. Surprisingly great to listen to while using opiates and other drugs too, due to the extremely hypnotic guitar used throughout the album."
1,Too Small. Too rough. Too Bad.,"Uh, was this meant to fit an infant? Seriously.. I don't know how this could fit any adult. Not only that but the material is extremely rough, and it came smelling very funky. I don't recommend."
5,Very satisfied,"I would recommed the seller, i got mine yesterday and its what i expected. Its just the right fit, it stretches and not small at all. I will purchase again in the future."
2,TOO MUCH,"While the content of the photographs is timeless and Kleins genius evident, I still found myself disapointed with this book. The problem is the layout. All the images are full bleeds covering every inch of paper. This means lots of cropping, no borders,absolutely no ""breathing space"" for any of the images, and of course the book's center seam running thru all the pictures. If the intent of this layout was to further emphasize the claustrophobic feeling of NYC then the publishers have succeeded . I found it tedious and I am sorry I purchased it."
3,"I-55 Series: Not as captivating as the game, but a good read","As a life-long Cardinal fan, I have experienced the joy and pain of the Cardinals-Cubs series. When I found this book, I snatched it right up.The book is woven with the stories of the players and all involved with the rivalry. Stories of some of the greatest games between the teams, the players who have seen both sides of the match-ups, and individual heroics bring the baseball and human side to life.If you are looking for heavy lore on the game, this book is not for you. But if you are looking for a book that brings some of the finer points of the rivalry out, and allows you to hear from some of the participants, this may be right. I found myself reading along with no concept of time or page numbers.My main criticism of this book is there were some factual errors found and several misspellings or typos. They seemed to stand out as ones that should have been caught, but somehow, were not."
4,good for the money,"This player is good for the size 512mb, small and that it can also be used as a flash drive no using battery during downloads. The price was not bad I got it for $50 at a local Fry's. Sound is average not as good as my ipod, but good enough for the gym. battery life was about 6.5 hours so not great but not the worst."
2,very poorly executed concept,"The basis of the story: During the reign of Henry II, his queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine, founded the Abbey of St. Jude, where young women can, in addition to living a life of prayer and contemplation, learn the knightly skills of weaponry.From this Abbey, expert swordswoman Avisa de Vere has been sent by the Queen to protect her godson, Christian Lovell, from the intrigue between the King and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Beckett.I thought the concept of women trained in the martial arts during the Middle Ages was interesting. Sadly, it was poorly executed in this book. The book plodded at times, and there was a fifty-page tangent which served little narratorial purpose other than to show that Avisa is a skilled fighter and a good leader.I'm intrigued by the concept of the book, and am sticking with the series - for a while - in the hopes that the writing will improve. However, for this volume itself: don't bother. It's too poorly written to stand on its own."
1,RIPOFF,These are not stainless steel lugnuts they are just stainless steel capped lugnuts. If you buy them you get stuck with paying the shipping back too. Don't waste your time or money like I did. This company should get nailed for false advertising this product!
5,"Excellent, informative film","I wish that everyone would see this film. I am from New Orleans, and the devastation from Hurricane Katrina is beyond what most people can imagine. This film accurately tells the story of the continued ineptitude of the Army Corps of Engineers in regards to the city of New Orleans. It also shows how certain whistleblowers have been penalized for their honesty and integrity concerning the situation.A lot of people don't understand why we New Orleanians blame the government for Katrina, since it was a ""natural"" disaster. You will get it after seeing The Big Uneasy."
5,Great allegory for Christian teaching.,Darby uses a young colt in an allegory to explain the basic tenants of Christianity. Edifying for the believer and beneficial to those curious enough to look into it. Sometimes Christians can get caught up in church doctrine and this book helps the reader put things in perspective. It's a quick read at 124 pages but gets the point across.
1,Not enough info,"I brought this video because I have a very busy schedule, so I thought I could save some time by watching the video for info on the Atkins Diet instead of reading the book. Well, I will not make that mistake again - it is not very informational, and after reading the book, I found the tapes didn't even do any of the explanations justice. The video was VERY basic, and if you wanted to understand the concepts of the diet, you still wouldn't after watching these tapes. You are much better off buying his books!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought these videos thinking they would give me with information that was not in the book or even more suggestions, boy was I surprised. It was a very cheaply made video that didn't provide anymore information than the book. Actually, it was less information in these video, than in the book.No matter how cheap you can get these videos, your best choice would be to get the book.Don't waste your money"
3,Easy Weightloss,"I am writing this review with regards to anyone out there who has been on the weight loss program. I found the video's(4 in total) and Tapes (4 aswell) very tiresome to watch. With regards to the book, well that was more informative.In total I have lost 20kg's over 19 weeks on this program without any trouble whatsoever. No hunger pangs or anything. So is this too good to be true ???"
2,"Perhaps Okay for High School, NOT for College","I really do like the Standard Deviants Series, but most of them, including this one, manages to only scratch the surface of its material, and not go into any real depth. It goes through about the first couple weeks of a college course, and then you're on your own. They really should only market these as great High School tools, because at $30 a pop, they are way too overpriced to be of any use to a college kid, except for really low level problems."
3,DVD does not come with menu markers,"It's great content - really! However, the DVD does not come with menu markers, so you can't really pick and choose segments to show to a class very well. It may as well be a VHS in that regard."
2,Disappointing,"Let me preface this by saying I really wanted to like this book. Unfortunately, it was uneven and poorly written. All the information is there, but it misses the mark. I did not think it would be possible for a book about such an unusual woman to be boring and tedious, but I'm afraid this was."
2,"A bland, if well-researched treatment","Although the life of the notorious Weimar Berlin dancer Anita Berber is full of enough drama, passion, eroticism, depravity and conflict to fill a dozen books, Mr. Gordon's treatment is oddly flat, even sterile. The facts are all there, but none of the emotion. Sadly, this book did not engage this reader."
2,Dancer in the Dark,"Double spaced pseudo-biography of a woman the author claims (in the title, no less) to have been a 'priestess of depravity'. What exactly qualifies her for that title remains something of a mystery as the book is about as deep and detailed as a long Wikipedia article. Two chapters of its 199 pages eschew Ms. Berber entirely, 23 of the final pages a collection of poetry. There is no index. What's left is a portrait, poorly defined, of a semi-anonymous woman viewed in an equally obscure and ill-defined environment. Overall a vague, lazy, listless disappointment."
5,Miss Divine's A Cold-Hearted Biotch,"I loved this book. Divine's voiced dripped of that sweet Southern twang like a ripe, hand-crushed Georgia peach. I disagree with a reviewer that the story is unbelivable. It's jam-packed with juicy sex, tragedy and the like. It was hard to put down. Check for The Bristol Ho-Tell One and Two from Ms. Smith if you need some hot erotica in your life. Oh yeah-Ms. Smith is my peeps- I got a signed copy. We might could collabo on some fiction-keep your eyes and ears to the streets. Speaking of the streets, stay on the lookout for Hustle Hard, a novel by Blaine Martin, early 2008."
5,Miss Divine will blow your mind!,"WHAT A WOMAN! This character Miss Divine can make a grown man cry. The cover is what caught my eye. When I saw that cover I had to pick the book up, any man would. It took me three days to finish this book. That's how good it was! The characters were so real, all I can say is, ""read this book"". Every man and woman I know has a copy and they can't seem to put it down. I can't wait to read the next book by Tri Smith. To all the men out there, all I can say is, if you've always wanted to read about a woman who has the power to make a grown man cry, meet Miss Divine. You won't regret it!"
2,Well below expectation,"Well, we will see how this product will perform when we have all the pieces... After waiting several weeks past the expected delivery date, the package was delivered with the inside box taped up and obviously previously opened. Parts were missing and we could not mount the burner for testing. Waiting for a call back from the manufacturer since a note in the package suggests that we should call them direct. Wish I had dealt with them directly. The stove appears to be light weight but I will hold my comments until I have an opportunity to test it. I certainly confirm my previous comment about the seller based on the delivery time and the state of the packaging upon arrival. Clumsy, well below standard and a far cry from what I expected from this vendor that had received positive comments from other buyers."
5,WOW,the player is extremely easy to use. I can control everything on it... FM... Recorder... don't hesitate to purhcase this wonderful product... the sound quality never be good.. strong buy...
4,The Wizard of Chicago,"Storm Front (2000) introduces Harry Dresden, the only wizard listed in the yellow pages in Chicago, Illinois. The police have Dresden on retainer to help with unusual crimes, and the two bodies whose hearts have exploded from their chests definitely qualify. Dresden has no doubt that this is serious (and illegal) black magic and begins to investigate the how in order to identify the who with the help of a sex-obsessed skull named Bob. Along the way, Dresden questions a greedy faery and a very hungry vampire before battling a demon and a few scorpions. Luckily, Dresden is very good at what he does, both as an investigator and as a wizard. This humorous blend of mystery and fantasy is perfect escapist fiction.http://www.stopyourekillingme.com/B_Authors/Butcher_Jim.html"
4,pretty good,"If fractions of stars were an option, I think I'd give ""Storm Front"" 3.5 instead of 4. The characters and the story were very good though nothing brilliantly original. The pace was sharp and the concept fresh. The only thing that really took away from the book for me was the muddling together of comic/campy and noir/hard boiled. The story has teeth enough to pull off the noir but either the author simply can't resist indulging in the comedy or wasn't secure enough to go straight serious. Harry comes across as a bit too ""cute"" with his smart remarks. In any event, it jolted me every time the jokey stuff cropped up right in the middle of a dramatic scene. Despite this, I liked the book and will read more in the series."
5,storm front,"By far, the best thing about this book is the first person narration by Harry Dresden. He is an instanly likeable character. He admits he has problems with women, but he somehow seems endearing. His sense of humor is just right; even in the face of death, Harry comes through with some jokes. He is serious about being a wizard but also realizes the craziness of it all.Butcher weaves three storylines together quite nicely, and one can't help but root for Harry. I wasn't so crazy about his love interest, Susan. Maybe she wasn't developed enough. I very much enjoyed Harry's cat, Mister, who drinks coke and eats steak sandwiches. The plot stays focused on the mystery and doesn't meander off course. There always seems to be a point to Harry's actions. I waited far too long to start this series b/c I was worried about a male voice being the main character. Though I am a female, I was instanly drawn to Harry."
4,Fun Read,This is a fun adventure easy readI enjoy the fast paceI can not wait to dig into the rest of the books
3,Quirky good.,"Part detective novel, part grown up Harry Potter, the Dresden series is exciting and fun. This Harry is your typical reluctant hero, but he has enough originality to make you turn the pages. Good plotting and pacing. SF channel has made this into a tv series."
4,"Humorous, engaging, easy to read","The Dresden books don't get boring, the character is likeable and there's a good dose of humour in these books. Also nasty staff. It's a good mix."
3,A Nice Change of Pace,"A light easy read and a good story line. I loved the melancholy main charactor, although, this melancholia bleeds into the story to the extent that it subdues the reader's reaction to what could be exciting events. I will probably read the rest of the series over time, but am not compelled to hurry into the next volume."
3,Awesome series starts weak,"The Dresden Files is one of my favorite series to read. The smart ass Harry Dresden doesn't care what he says to whom, and tends to piss a lot of people off. Oh and magic. But unfortunately, Storm Front definitely feels like a first time novel for Jim Butcher, which sucks, because a lot of people will be turned off to this series because of it. Read this book to introduce yourself to the characters of the series and KEEP READING! It does get better around book 3, when the side plots of the series start to unravel themselves better."
3,Too slow,"Good premise, but this author needs a stronger editor. A lot of the narrator's inner debates are repetitious. I understand the use of digressions to increase suspense, but it doesn't work here."
4,Really great book!,"I love it. Good story, and good bookI even got my wife to read it and she also liked it, and she is very critical on all kinds of books."
4,JUST STARTED THE SERIES,I just started Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden series and find it very well done!! The characters are interesting and the magic is used sparingly and with just enough explanation to allow the reader to imagine the rest.I find the price for each book in this old series high and wish that less expensive bundles would be available. The physcial books can be found in most used book stores for considerably less.
5,"Hello, I'm a wizard","Different take on the whole sci-fi realm. Wish Dreseden wasn't such a wuss, but seems there is something in his past he's trying to keep hidden. Gotta say the books are much better than the butchered TV series that thankfully only ran for a season."
3,Quality Urban Fantasy,"Jim Butcher is a wonderful writer, and his characters are engaging and marvelous. I STRONGLY recommend the Dresden Files in general. That said, this first book is a bit formulaic and can be annoying at times. That old writers' maxim of ""Make a lot of bad things happen to your characters"" has perhaps been taken a touch too far in STORM FRONT. Difficulties keep piling and piling on Harry Dresden, but these difficulties are more annoying than engaging. To sum this book up with a two word pun (that you'll get if you're familiar with the series), STORM FRONT is ""Murphey's Law"".If you're new to the Dresden Files, I actually recommend starting with book 3: GRAVE PERIL, which is much more engaging and more indicative of how Jim Butcher really knows his stuff."
1,Bad e-book translations,"Ok, I really like reading the Dresden files. But the author, publishers, and all who are involved in making a quality book are ill served by typos, misplaced commas, and these strange annotation markings in the e-book versions. Amazon should NOT be charging top dollar for a poor product.I went right through the first few in the series, the story is that good. But now on 'blood rites', I am beginning to get tired of the typos, and had to say something."
2,Bleh,"Good: Entertaining (a little)Bad: Predictable, reads like it was transcripted from a cheesy action movie. No background. Only 2 ""cases"" the detective takes are one and the same. Deus Ex events (there literally is a character that shows up at key moments just to push the story, then disappears). Main character always manages to set down or drop his weapons just as a fight starts. Magic is boring and inconsistent.The writing could be good, but the author would need to tweak his action and totally redo his plot. It comes off as an adolescent book. There is no complexity, no backstory (other than just monologue), no weight to the world. Characters are flat and can be mixed up. Data dumps. Physical descriptions take priority over depth.In a nutshell, Dresden is interesting. The world and other characters are not.Adolescents and light-hearted readers would enjoy this more. I'd like some weight to my stories :("
4,"Good book, Good reader",An excellent hybrid fantasy/detective novel. Jim Butcher does a good job creating a magic world at the edge of our everyday world. There is a bit of humor mixed in with the tension. The only short coming for me was that occasionally Harry's (Dresden) angst is over done. Spike ... err James Marsters does an excellent job reading Storm Front.
4,Great debut novel,This novel is fun and sometimes funny. The main character is very likable. Good book I really liked it.
2,Not Sure about this book,"I started the book, skipped huge chunks of it, finished the book and now am wondering if I want the next one in the series. Sometimes writers get so caught up in the ""let me introduce you to my character"" part of writing, that the underlying plot gets lost. I wanted to like this character. I needed to enjoy this book. I shouldn't do this, but after reading and listening to WOT, I hold authors, who claim to be able to write, up to Robert Jordan. Would I recommend this book? No, sorry I wouldn't. There are so many other fantasy type authors who put more life into the story, more zest and guts into their characters, that I can't really recommend this book."
2,i wish i had liked it better,"Alas, a predictable plot outcome, shaky history, and unengaging characters left me dissapointed. I had been led to this book by a friend who likened it to the older Anita Blake books. Well, if Anita was a man, a wizard, and was without the crazy sex drive, then she would be Dresden. Butcher even used some of her catch lines, and a lot of her ""if i'm going down, i'm going down fighting"", attitude. With Anita, it worked and went with her character, with Dresden, it's sort of baseless, and unoriginal. The story was bland, and seemed to be more of an introduction to the series than a self-contained novel. The author may improve in future books, but i found this one so uninspired, and i have to say boring, that i won't be reading them to find out."
3,Waste of my time.,"The first book was a waste of my time. I was recommended this after telling someone I watched the TV show. I found the show so much more enjoyable than the books if only for the fact that I'm only wasting 45 minutes, not four hours. Since I've already wasted enough time with the book, I'm not going to further waste it thinking about it any more writing a review on it. I just wanted to warn people. Pulp trash. I'm being overly generous with three stars, too."
3,an ok book,butcher has a habit of not fully introducing his characters. i found myself not really caring about his characters. murphys just annoying.
3,Book one of the Dresden Files,"So I heard that this guy has a talking skull, I had to check out this book. In the first installment of the Dresden files, we meet Harry Dresden a private detective who just happens to be a wizard. The details were there, I felt like I was right beside Dresden on his investigations. Each chapter had something to offer and made the storyline move along nicely. I enjoyed the scenes where Dresden would find himself in hot water. I would liked to see more action where Dresden was forced to use his wizard skills. The action really picks up in the last third of the book. I enjoyed this mystery/fantasy story and the talking skull."
3,BEGINNING OF THE DRESDEN FILES,"I generally like fantasy series. I like the idea of building up the character for future adventures. So we get Harry Dresden, wizard; really he is, he is in phone book and the police use him. Harry is ok, pretty nice character really. But the rest of the book fell flat for me. Had trouble keeping the pages turning. I think it will go onto my reread list, because friends like the series. Good luck."
4,Great first Novel,"I love Jim Butcher. I honestly cannot remember a series of books that I have enjoyed more than I do the Dresden Files. Jim manages to mix three of my favorite genres into one series (Fantasy, Mystery, and Horror).Storm Front starts out quickly and moves at a great pace through the story. I had a very hard time putting it down. It is very obviously a first novel however, while the writing is not bad it is the weakest of the series. Butcher is vastly improved by the second book.If you're looking for a great series that you will not be able to get enough of look no further than the Dresden Files. Storm Front is a great start to an even more amazing series."
4,Highly entertaining book,"A very well written book that moves at a rapid pace with great characters, Storm Front by Jim Butcher is a very entertaining story and series.Pros- very quick pace, fallable main character Dresden who has wizardly powers but can not solve everything by using only his magical powers. Good who-dun-it story telling with fantasy elements. Set in Chicago, my home town.Cons- not many, this book is not for children or teenagers with the language and gore. Definitely an adult read.A highly recommended series."
5,Great Reading,"If you like Harry Dresden you will enjoy this reading very much. The whole book is included, and James Marsters (Spike of Buffy the Vampire Slayer) does an Outstanding job of reading it. I intend to get all these books (with James Marsters reading), and urge the production of ALL the Harry Dresden series using Mr. Marsters as the reader."
5,A great audio book,"I've read almost all of the Dresden books at this point, and I've listened to James Marsters' readings of Books 1 - 4.The stories are entertaining, and Marsters' performance makes them even better. If you're looking to be entertained in the car on the way to work by a fantasy novel with its fair share of humor, you really can't go wrong.I'd recommend this even for people who have already read the book. It's really that well done."
5,Always a good read!,"I've been reading Jim Butcher for years, and always found him to provide a reliably good read. Despite the increased cost now that the series is more popular, its worth taking a chance on this series if you enjoy well-written urban fantasy. Now that I find myself reading mostly on the Kindle app, I'm re-collecting in ebook version some favorites I first collected in printed form. Amazon, take note - for those of us who have been buying printed books from you for a decade or more, why can't we download the Kindle versions of what we bought in print from you at a discount, if not for free?"
2,Not my cup of tea,"I know this is a very well-loved series, and I was looking forward to diving in. But I'm not much of a fan of the old-fashioned detective story. Adding magic to the mix was interesting to me, but the dark and gory components turned me off."
3,A fun and easy read with some humor.,"This is the first book in a series following the adventures of Harry Dresden, wizard PI. I listened to this as an audiobook. Harry was an entertaining character to follow, and Jim Butcher seems adept at getting his wizard into ever worsening situations. The pacing was fast and even though some parts of the plot were a little predictable, it was still entertaining. Harry is funny, and some of the situations (like when a love potion is mixed up with another) are also humorous. I'm planning to give the next book a listen."
4,Finally surrendered to the hype,"... And had a great time. The noir-magical mix works well, even when the noir aspect gives way to the magical one at about the last third of the book. Nice, adequately stereotypical characters, a sense of humor, and a protagonist that can look at the same time badass and vulnerable made for a very enjoyable reading experience."
4,Storm From,"I purchased this first book in this series to see if I would enjoy it. I usually prefer longer books but this premise intrigued me as I am a big fan of wizards, etc. and one in the present time frame was different. I'm not sure I will continue to read the rest of the books but this was a nice diversion...........for a weekend."
5,great,"I have watch Dresden first season on DVD and it was great, but when I got the book it was far better than the DVD that I watch, it goes deeper into what Dresden does as a wizard and his fears."
3,"the dresden files, book 1","it was interesting, different, it dragged a bit, sometimes had a problem deciding where the story was going, now that i have read 3 of the dresden books find my review would be the same for all three, but, on the other hand i have read 3, go figure?"
2,Male Anita Blake,"The main character is Harry Dresden, a wizard who runs his own practice and occasionally helps out the police in solving ""weird"" crimes. And doing all that, he naturally (supernaturally?) gets into all kinds of trouble and danger. While entertaining and witty, it really left me feeling as if Mr Butcher had taken Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake and swapped 'she' with 'he' and 'her' with 'him'. The same wise-cracking jokes, the same attitudes, the same situations as in, say,Guilty Pleasures (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter). I suppose 'Storm Front' is good for those who haven't read the Anita Blake series. But even then I would recommend they read the latter first! :)"
2,Just OK,"Given the opportunity again, I would not pay money to read this book. The characters are shallow and unrealistic. The plot was fairly easy to figure out and flat. The main character was just down right terrible. I finished the book but will not read any others from the series. It was a disappointment."
4,Definitively a fun and easy read,"I finished this book in just a day or two, which is very rare for me. I didn't think it was great, but I found myself attached to the story and liked the characters. I especially liked Harry Dresden. He was dirt broke since he didn't have much work. But yet, he was a powerful wizard. Aside from getting in trouble with the White Council, he also had mobsters after him. Though he had offers to make lots of money working for the bad guys, he valued his principles more than money.The story at times seemed to be more like something you'd see in a cartoon (albeit, a cartoon for adults) or perhaps even a comic book (and yes, I do realize it is now available as a comic). But still, it's definitely a fun story. It seems to have been written for an older audience as well.The story wasn't very thought-provoking. It was more of a `sit back and enjoy the show' type book for me. Not really my cup of tea, but I still enjoyed it very much."
3,High speed urban fantasy - don't expect Twilight romance,"Storm Front introduces Harry Dresden, and fully qualified and yellow-page advertising wizard. Most of his bills are paid for by the police who while somewhat skeptical sometimes need a little help on freakier cases.The story is fast-paced and heavy on the mystical. Butcher throws in dozens of characters both mundane and magic and somehow manages to build a world as fantastic as Harry Potter without compromising the gritty police procedural feel of the story.The writing could be called somewhat sexist, most of the woman are hotties and and high proportion of said hotties use their wiles to get the better of Dresden. Nonetheless Harry is a modest rake and a good dose of humour keeps the prose grounded.Much recommended"
4,First time.,"I had never read anything in this genre before, but I am glad that I have now. Normally, I stick with biographies and the such. Glad to step out on a limb and try something new. I will say that I felt that the ending felt a little rush, but all in all it was a good read."
4,Very Much Enjoyable,"Storm Front is the first book in the Dresden Files and it tells the story of Harry Dresden, a wizard, who is hired by the Chicago police to solve a double murder done with black magic.Ok so, Storm Front is by no means a masterpiece, it's not the greatest book to have ever been written. It is however, a highly entertaining read, which is what I want in a book. It was fast-paced, action-packed and like I said, entertaining. Not to sound all cliché, but I couldn't put it down. I liked it enough that I have already picked up the second book in the series.Storm Front is a solid, quick read perfect for those that love fantasy and mystery. Could it be better? Sure. There were times when it was too fast-paced, there were scenes that really should have been fleshed out some more. But overall it was a great read that I thoroughly enjoyed."
4,fun and suspenseful,"Harry is a wise cracking, stubborn wizard. He tries to do what is right even though he knows it is most likely going to kill him. The humor is in the characters, the wisecracks and the situations he gets himself in. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The language is stilted at times, but the plot is good. It reminds me of a Chandler with humor and magic. The villians and some of the good guys are scary. Harry is definitely likeable. I had fun reading it and the book was hard to put down. I can't wait to read the next one."
2,Disappointed,"I had high expectation for this book, as I am a fan of mysteries and fantasy/sci-fi, but this was not my cup of tea. I found the characters unpleasant, and never reached a point where I got really into the plotline either."
3,"Dresden Files, book one","I would say more like 3.5 stars. I liked this book well enough and it kept me interested with the different things that happened and with the world building. It's not five stars because it wasn't un-put-downable and it wasn't a full four stars because super intriguing. It was a good solid book with good solid world building and many things happened to keep up the pace of the story. However, I felt that there could have been a bit more character development with Bob and maybe Murphy and Susan. I didn't like....can't explain it without spoilers, sorry.I did like that this was written from a male perspective and there were some humorous lines in the book. I will keep reading this series :)"
3,I don't quite know what to make of the series,"Storm Front was the first book I read. I found it to be a good read and the lead character, Harry Dresden, to be somewhat sympatico (if a little dense). After reading the next two books in the series, I find them entertaining in a way, but the stories all seem to run in a predictable pattern - Harry runs into trouble, nearly loses, but comes through in the end. Still, the books (so far) have been page turners."
3,storm front,This book was OK. It was predictable with interesting charactors. It was a quick read. I probably wouldn't recommend it.
4,It's a great start to a better series,"I hope you have a lot of free time in the weeks ahead because this book hooked me hard and I devoured the rest of the series(I'm re-reading them now in preparation for the new title out in Nov)without stopping.I give this one 4 stars just on the basis that it is an earlier effort and I feel Mr. Butcher has improved in his abilities to flesh out characters, create tension and atmosphere, and pace a book. That said, I still find it a very entertaining read. Part Gumshoe and part Gandalf, Harry Dresden is a very likable character that the author seems to take perverse delight in heaping trouble after trouble on. Pages fly by like leaves in the wind as you want to find out how Harry is going to come out of these messes.This is not a world changing book by any means. I don't think the author has any great message or knowledge to impart. I think this series has just one purpose, to entertain you. In that regard it is a wonderful success."
4,My first novel by Butcher but not the last!,I was pleasantly surprised the fun i had reading this funny and thoughtful detective novel. his characters were well developed with depth and the requisite quirkyness with a modern day Wizard as the protagonist. I'm ready to go to #2 now and so on and so on and etc.
4,fun read,"The book was a fun read with some suspense thrown in. A little Harry Potterish, which was good too. A nice light read."
4,My first Kindle book,"This is the first Kindle ebook I've bought. I wanted something not too challenging to make sure I liked reading on the Kindle.The book itself is entertaining, very much a traditional detective story but set in a world with magic, demons, etc. Belongs on your shelf next to the Anita Blake novels, the Newford novels, and your Buffy & Angel DVD's. Also, it's much better than the SciFi channel series, which is a very watered-down version.But why aren't books 2, 3, and 8 available on the Kindle?! I have no desire to read them out-of-order, and I'd prefer to read them all on the Kindle (it's great for ""light-reading"" paperbacks). Hopefully Amazon will add them soon. I'll be checking regularly."
3,This one is hard to get into,"I purchased the entire series of the available Dresdin file books that were available upon the recommendation of the clerk at the local book store. He warned me that the first books were just so, so, but that with each book, Butcher got better and better.I thought that the main character showed a little to much of putting the blame on himself for the things that he caused in using his powers to save others. The descriptions of events and places can also get to be to much as they are repeated over and over. I made it through this book and probably would not have continued the series if I had not been told that the other books got better. On the whole I think if you can stick with this book it is a good read to get into the rest of the series."
5,So Much Better Than Laurell K Hamilton - Amazing Series!!,"I recently began reading supernatural thrillers and like many people began with the series I'd heard most about - Laurell K Hamilton's Anita Blake books. Although the first few books were good it gradually became almost pornographic and I stopped reading them. In an attempt to curb my craving for more supernatural reads I stumbled upon Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden Series. Thank goodness I did. THEY ARE AMAZING. Great stories, great characters, lots of surprises, and quick reads. I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys a good book - not just fans of supernatural.If you've seen the Dresden Files tv show currently on SciFi but have not yet read the books - stop watching and read the books! The show has left so much out it doesn't even begin to represent how wonderful the book series is."
3,Wonderful Fantasy/Wizard series...horrible audio CD,"I have read all ten of the Harry Dresden books and I have to say that they pull you in from the very beginning. They have a wonderful mix of wizardry, romance, suspense, violence, you name it. It all blends together in a way that leaves you longing for the next book in the series.I must caution you though on the audio versions of the first 4 books that have been released. When I first saw the audio book versions, I was very excited until I heard them. James Marsters is the narrator and he is horrible. I highly enjoy watching James Marsters act (Buffy, Angle, Torchwood, Smallville) but narrate...he cannot. He just sounds bored. Only on characters that are not Harry Dresden does he seem to try...If I would have started the series with the audio books...I probably never would have given them a chance and truly missed out on a wonderful series.My advice. Read the books...enjoy the short lived TV show...skip the audio books."
5,A great book,"Not having used the audiobook version, I can't testify to it, but I must say, this book is very entertaining, and I highly reccommend it."
3,Slow,"I was excited to get into such a popular series, but while the story was okay, the pacing was terrible! Overall it just seemed really slow and the characters were hard to connect with. I think I will try the next book and hopefully it will be better."
2,Not so great.,"Sometimes you get a book and you are overwhelmed at how good it is and some you are overwhelmed by how not so good a book is. This book was the later.I had an opportunity to listen to the audio tape of this book (well parts of it) about a year ago. I went out and bought the whole series based on a small listening of the book. James Marsters did a great job. I love his voice and really was the reason why I went out an bought the series.I wanted to like the series, wanted to praise it like many people who have recommended the books. I like the author he is very nice.However, I just could get into Harry. I didn't like the story line, the plot, the characters, and the over all feeling of the book.I can't identify with Harry nor with anyone in the series. The only interesting character is Bob."
2,pretty lame,"I can't believe this book got so many good reviews. This is what I usually go by when purchasing a book. Nothing really makes a lot of sense and Harry,the main character, is a very indecisive person. I think I might start writing a book also. It couldn't be much worse. If this a indication of what readers are thinking is good writing nowdays, we're in trouble."
2,"Loved the Shows, but the books?...","I loved the short-lived series entitled ""The Dresden Files"", and was looking forward to reading the books by Jim Butcher; but the Kindle price has definitely put me off. And then I am reading from other fans that the Penguin production of it is POORLY done, full of typos and grammatical errors that one has to wonder how any fan could buy this carp?Sadly, I will have to look elsewhere to get my neo-mystery thriller yen on. NO SALE Amazon."
5,"wonderful,wonderful","As a lover of both books and sci-fi,, it is hard for me to write a bad revue of a book, and this revue is true to form-wonderful!! I found it easy to read with fun characters. You'll love it."
4,Fun to read,I enjoyed this book because it really had a unique twist the world of a Wizard. It kept me interested until the end.
3,a great series,"This book of the Dresden series is the first and also the weakest. However, the series is actually great. The second book is better than the first and the third book shows that Mr. Butcher has pulled this series together. The fourth book is really great. I was also a fan of Laurell K. Hamilton, especially her early books, but I have lost interest because of the repetitive nature of her books. Some powerful vamp. or other nasty comes to town, or she goes to its town, and there is a contest of wills. This contest devolves into sexual intimidation of some sort and so on. I think Mr. Butcher understands what Miss Hamilton used to. Read their books and see for yourself, but for me, I plan on reading the Dresdon series from this point on.Thanks"
2,Confused by positive reviews,"I purchased this based on all the positive reviews, and I thought the concept of a wizard crime solver was intriguing. And the book might have been had it not been for all the forced similes in the effort to make characters appear witty, or something. ""Like a flying monkey from the Wizard of Oz"", ""closed like a bank on Sunday"" - seriously? I can allow for a certain amount of suspension of disbelief at some of the plot holes, but I found myself way too often not being able to get past how lame some of the passages were. I suppose it was worth the diversion, but certainly didn't impress me enough to continue with the other books."
4,fun book,I enjoyed reading this book and finished it less than a week (I am a slow reader). The book was exciting from start to finish and I will continue reading other books in the series.
4,A beginning !,book one of what has become a 10+ series. Read from the beginning because this series is great but needs context.
5,Older Harry Potter With Cooler Attitude And Smarter Mouth,"Two things got me interested in this series a friend at work was telling me about these novels and I saw some of the Dresden files t.v. show both got me to buy the first novel and I have not been disappointed with that decision.The action is great as well as the storyline,characters,and of course the magical developments in the stories. Harry Dresden to me is what Harry Potter should be like when he grows up. Even Though I've just finished the first book I have already ordered the rest of the series up to book ten and with the good discount I've gotten on Amazon it was a pretty good price considering that for eight books at the store would cost about $64.00 I paid $45.00 on Amazon. So I say to viewers if you're interested check out the first book or check out the showand decide for yourself if you want to get the rest of this great story-saga."
4,Fantasy and Comedy,"I am not much of a Sci Fi or Fantasy reader but Jim Butcher throws in enough comedy to make the Dresden Files a worthwhile read. I really enjoyed this first of the series and have already purchased the next couple. If you enjoy Fantasy, comedy or Gumshoe detective stories this series is for you."
5,Fast-Paced Enjoyable Read,"Harry Dresden is just your average slob, a guy down on his luck most of the time, inept with women, and often lacking in funds. The only difference between him and millions of guys is that Harry is a full-fledged practicing wizard, the only one listed in the Chicago phone book.Harry works as a consultant for the Chicago PD's special crimes unit, driving Detective Murphy crazy. In this tale, Harry falls into a missing husband case, gets beat up by Mafiosi, and must deal with an evil magician who is killing people by pulling their hearts out of their chests.Like most recent readers, I picked up this book after having watched the television show on the Sci-Fi channel. It does not disappoint. In fact, I found this magical mystery to be more memorable than other mainstream mysteries which I forget about 10 minutes after the last page is turned."
4,very enjoyable first in series,Very enjoyable first in the series.. Harry is not larger than life and he does have bad hair days.Bob the skull is wonderful.. very sarcastic and a fun addition to this book.I also loved the cat Mister.Look forward to more in the series although i wish harry would not be so damned nice!
1,Sadness comes to my house,Book was not like new. It looked like it had been used to beat a mule to death. I tossed it in the garbage when I opened the package. I will just replace it with a new copy from Barnes & Noble. Sadness comes in many forms and for me today it came in the form this book.
4,Glad I Tried It,"I'm glad I gave this a shot. Recommended by a friend, I was reluctant to try a supernatural PI fantasy kind of thing. I really enjoyed the story line and there was plenty of action and sensuality to make it very well rounded. The biggest drawback to the story is that Harry Dresdon is supposed to be this extremely complex character, but the character developement was pretty surface.The story itself was pretty good. A lot of action from about the middle on, and complex enough to keep you interested in the ""Who Done It"" portion."
4,A great pulp fiction series,"Harry Dresden is a Chicago PI pulled out from the standard film noir mold, with one major difference, he is a wizard. Starting from that premise, Butcher writes one of the best pulp action adventure novels that I have ever read. The whole series which is soon to release its ninth book, is a ride full of clever one liners and crazy battles. It does not suprise me that the SF channel is making a series out of this book, because these books are more inspired by movies and TV shows than by any literature. Harry is always just getting by, barely surviving, poor beat up and one step away from disaster. The supporting character start out as fairly one dimensional, but Butcher does a good job of stopping and filling in his character every once in a while. The series grows, and the characters change very nicely over the couse of the series giving and arc and storyline, but still allowing the books to be read in any order. Overall one the better series being currently produced."
4,"Great Voice, both in the reading and writing","Jim Butcher has given his character, Harry Dresden, a great voice. He is witty, sly, and multi-dimensional. I enjoyed living his adventures and his many day to day frustrations that come from being a professional wizard. An added treat with the audio version of this book is the talent of James Marsters. He brings so much to Harry Dresden, as well as the many other characters in the book. His reading of the piece is dynamic and never boring, and his voice is a pleasure to listen to for hours on end. The only complaint I have of this CD is that the only format I could find still in publication was the MP3 format, which means I have to sit in front of my computer to listen to it. If the publishers would make more in regular CD format, this would be a 5 star review."
4,Everyone should love this Wizard!,"This series was highly recommended to me by other fantasy-book lovers. I enjoyed the tongue in cheek humor and appreciated the police hiring a Wizard as a consultant. It was entertaining and interesting. With all his power, our wizard could be very self-deprecating in a very entertaining manner. I look forward to continuing the series."
4,Storm Front is worth reading,"This is an entertaining book. Paranormal topics, humour and a bit of mystery are present throughout ""Storm Front"". It can be read pretty fast, and the author has the ability of keeping the reader interested in what's happening; he does not write long, boring descriptions as many other authors do. I enjoyed it, maybe had more expectations about it, but it was really good anyway."
3,Amusing read,Amusing magical mystery tale from the perspective of a social outcast with a sense of secret importance. As an introduction to this world it could have done with a bit more of an explanation of the rules.
5,Great series!,"This is the best supernatural urban series I have read. If Laurell K. Hamilton has gone too far and you're kinda sick of it, if Tanya Huff's series left you with a feeling of, ""Oh."" This series will not let you down. I devoured all that are avaliable."
4,Good series.,"I like Harry Dresden he certainly knows how to show a lady a good time. Of course, thats just part of the story he is a wizard who works with the police on solving cases that are hard cases to solve. Karin Murphy is a tough lady cop who always gives Harry a hard time,but I think that she reall cares about Harry. This case is about who murdered Tom-Tom and Jenny Stanton. Toot-Toot and Bob the talking skull are very interesting side characters and I hope to see more of them. I am now starting Fool Moon and really enjoying it. Keep up the good work Jim, Ilike these books."
1,"Predictable, Superficial and Rather Boring","I love a good mystery and enjoy a paranormal slant in a book. What drew me to Butcher's book was a recommendation he made on a Laurel Hamilton (Anita Blake) novel and I had high hopes that it would be a good relaxing romp. Sadly, I was rather disappointed.The main character is Harry Dresden who for all intensive purposes plays Gumshoe specializing in the occult. Often a consultant to the local PD, he is drawn into a murder case which involves the use of Black Magic.The book reads well but regretably, there is nothing new here. The plot is predictable, the characters shallow, little interpersonal development and as for a mystery...you'll know who did it before you're a third through the book."
1,"Candy, and not very good candy","Everyone of the dresden files books are based on the ""stupid person"" premise. Harry Dresden is a stupid person. When confronted with a choice where one involves reason and other people or doing something stupid, Dresden chooses to be stupid. This choice is made without exception. Butcher uses pendantic predictable and utterly banal structure throughout his books.Where the writing trods along the language follows with little variation and interest. Butcher cannot seem to make up his mind about profanity using it in clumsy and odd ways. Quaint swear words are used judiciously.Butcher's only way to move the plot forward is to have his character do something dumb and then fight his way out of it. Butcher also announces major plot points with no subtlety or nuance.These books are a colossal waste of time.Yes, I read them. I read a lot of books.If you don't have a lot of time, stay away from this turgid series. It just isn't that good."
1,TOO EXPENSIVE!,"I am NOT going to pay 9.99 for a paperback book that can sell easily for 6-7.99!!!! And the Kindle edition??? 9.99???? What is this, highway robbery? Forget the new ones, I'm hitting the less than 3.00 used ones. I thought Kindle editions were supposed to SAVE you money??? For a paperback??? No--fricken--way!!"
4,A good start to the series.,"It was a good start to the series with a nice development of the characters and establishment of the Dresden Mythos (the establishment of magic, the social circles of magical creatures and beings, etc.) It was a good read and I did not want to put it down. I thought that someone of Dresden's ""skill level"" would not get as beat up and make so many mistakes, but it is what it is."
4,Fast-paced Genre-Bending Fun!,"A compact, fast-moving, self-aware genre mash-up with a unique, very human protagonist: STORM FRONT makes a great summer read you don't need to feel guilty about. Genre fans will get the most out of it. B+See full review here: http://quixotic-deminimus.blogspot.com/2009/07/book-review-storm-front-dresden-files-1.html"
5,Combination of Travis McGee and Harry Potter,I was first exposed to _The Dresden File_ on the SciFi channel. I enjoyed it and saw that it was based on books by Jim Butcher. I checked it out and could not put it down. It is well written and entertaining. Mr. Butcher has done his research well as well as being a helluva writer. I recommend all of his Dresden books!
5,Harry Potter Grows Up! Great Grown Up Fare!,"I am not a fan of magic/mysticism/fantasy fiction. Got nothing against it, it's just not my normal cup of tea. But I was very, very impressed with this first Dresden adventure. The magic was easily woven into the real world and seemed as real as the setting. The narrative voice was interesting as was the character through which it speaks. There's a lot of great action, interesting plotting and a quick, engaging pace. This book was a great read and I'll be back for more! Great stuff!"
3,"Harry, Harry, Harry","Don't get me wrong, I love this series and have been following it for a while, but Storm Front was an awkward read. It smacked too close to Laurrel K. Hamilton's world that was set up I almost expected a camio appereance.I stuck it out and was glad I picked up the second book, Fool Moon.I don't suggest skipping the book though. Rough around the edges, but very important to the series. It sets up the world and introduces plot points that are touched upon in later books.Then again, I'm a purest."
5,Book Review,This is a great story. I will follow the story in future books. The characters are very real and are easy to merge with for a fun ride.Chas E. Moser
4,Interesting Contemporary Fantasy Mystery,"Netflix orginally turned me onto the T.V. series and I loved it. I'm a huge SyFy channel fan. I usually read more conventional Fantasy, but after watching and loving the show, I gave the series a chance and loved it. I read the first book in one day. I highly recomend it to EVERYONE, fantasy/mystery fan or not, it is definately a great read."
5,Fantasy Noir is Outstanding,"Harry Dresden is a standout character: a wizard with a job, limitations, and a lot on his mind. The development of such an interesting lifestyle coupled with an impressive array of supernatural groups vying for territory in power could be enough, but Butcher adds a plot filled with suspense. Worth one read? Yes. Worth two? Yes. Worth checking out the entire series based on this first book? Definitely."
5,Highly engaging,"My son and I share a love of science fiction, and he recommended this series to me. I'm more of a ""Sword of Truth"" slash ""Dune"" slash ""Rama"" kind of reader but was in need of new material, so I bought ""Storm Front"" for my new Kindle. Wow - right from the first page I was deeply engaged in the story! Loved the characters, especially Harry, they were so real I felt that I might actually meet them at Navy Pier. Loved the plot development and how Mr. Butcher kept it moving forward to the crisis between Victor and Harry. I'm really looking forward to the remaining books in the series!"
2,Okay,"I guess I'm the only one who found this book a bit boring and unoriginal. I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters, and I thought the mystery could have been a little more creative. All and all, I probably won't pick up the next book in the series unless I'm desperate for something to read."
3,"Storm Front, Dresden Files,Book 1","good read, lots of excitement for syfi buffs. fun and easy, rec. to you that enjoy exploring the other life forms."
2,Good for what it is,"I was a fan of the Dresden Files show, so, I wanted to read the books. Normally, print is better than video, but in this case it was not. Butcher has mastered the art of the cliche and the ability to tell me about things, rather than showing me. The writing is as good as anything else out there that is successful commercially, but I had hoped for better. I did not get it."
3,Fun Must Read,"You have to love Harry Dresden , a down on his luck Wizard\detective for hire just trying to stay out of trouble while making a buck but that is just not going to happen easily and that is when the fun starts.There is a secondary character that watches over Harry who I found a little one dimensional\unbelievable especially in the end .Also there is no sub-plot so the story moves along fairly quickly.Nontheless , I just love how he defines the creatures in this world .Harry's magic has limits which make for interesting confrontations and informers from another magical realm are always hard to deal with!I have already ordered the next book and look forward to many adventures with Harry Dresden."
2,The equivalent of straight to video,"Narrated in a boringly plain language by the protagonist, Harry, who goes up against ""some guy"" that just happens to have gone bad. The villain doesn't even show up in person until late in the book. The primary thing we learn about characters other than Harry is how much shorter they are. Reading the book felt as if I was stuck sitting next to Harry on a bus ride that had me politely nodding feigned interest while wishing we'd run out of fuel."
2,Blah.,"Even though Dresden has noble intentions and desires to help humanity, he practically sedates himself with nonchalance. I don't enjoy looking through the eyes of a fully functioning man (mentally) who can't face reality and has as little ambition as Dresden does. I did, however, find the community that goes to Mac's bar to be very interesting (though it was barely touched upon) and liked how the author tied magic into a drug feud. I also don't like the author's portrayal of white magic. Particularly how he ties it to the pentacle. The magic in this book borders on real ""magyk"" which I believe is entirely unnecessary."
2,bad book supplier,"The book is good, but I bought a book used, almost new. It is missing the last pages. Will not buy from that supplier again."
3,The book? Great. MP3 CD? Seriously lacking.,"Since this show came on the SciFi Channel people have been saying how much better the books are (which is usually the case). So I decided to grab the audio-book to listen to while working.I opted for the MP3 version in the hopes (or reasonable expectations) that the tracks would be easier to follow since they were MP3s. I expected one MP3 per chapter and hopefully named. No such luck, just several folders with ""Track 01.mp3"", ""Track 02.mp3"" etc.It's a shame, seems like they just rushed it out for the heck of it. However, the book is still great, and the narration is on point."
2,Wish I'd read the reviews before buying this book,"Okay, I thought it was going to be noir-ish with an occult spin, but I was surprised by the excellent writing in the face of an extremely weak premise. A wizard? Really? Called in by the cops to the scene of an extremely gory double murder even before the forensic team had arrived? I had to delete this book from my Kindle, I'm afraid, even if doing so ranks me as some sort of snob. Sorry."
4,Laugh out loud family fun!,"We played this game with our 3 boys, ages 14, 11, 10 and they not only beat us (parents), the pulverized us! We had so much family fun and we laughed so hard throughout the game play. It's a great game!"
3,6+ is way too young,"I think this will be a fun game when my kids are older. My boys got this game for Christmas (they are 6&8). The age on the box says 6+, but it needs to say much older (maybe 8+). My 6 year old can't read the questions and my 8 year old doesn't know hardly any of the answers and sometime has a hard time reading the 'big' words. We will put the game away for a year or two and then try it again."
2,no fun for parents!,"Unless you have watched all of the Harry Potter movies and Lord of the Rings movies, this game is not much fun for parents! It seems that half of the questions toward parents have to deal with these movies. It would be nice if the questions were a little more educational, and not so much movie and video game related. I guess that it is supposed to be fun for kids in that they get to ask questions to their parents that they already know the answers to, but I think kids could also learn from having to ask the parents more educational questions. Sadly, it seems we live in a world where our children are consumed with television and video games!"
4,It was what I expected,It was well packaged. The machining was well done and I liked the looks of it.It was easy t clean up and use.
5,Great price,"These are a great value and quite accurate. I've ordered several sets and they all have checked within .0002"". Handy for set ups and I also use for welding projects to clamp to pieces to the same block to make a 90 degree joint."
5,Exquisite!,"I received this watch as a gift, although I had actually picked it out for my ""wish list"". It is a very lovely watch for the under $500 category. Many people have complimented me and asked what brand it is. The face is larger than most women's watches but still doesn't look overwhelming on my very small wrists. It is also versatile, I wear it to work with dresses and skirts but it also looks fine when I am dressed casual, even in jeans. I highly recommend it."
4,Impressive watch for wife,Nice watch for the someone serious in your life to express how you feel about her.
2,Mighty irritated,I felt cheated since the watch i was sent was not working.IT was a horrid waste of time and effort to pack it per the painfully detailed instructions to get it 'repaired'. I had to convince the customer support that since i've never recieved a watch in working condition i don't need this to be 'repaired' but a new working watch be sent to me. After a delay of another week i did get one in the mail which seems to be working fine so far.Also the watch looks better in the photographs than in fact. Its a little cheapy looking if the idea is that it looks a little diamond-y.
1,Large Watch,"This is a beautiful watch, but just a word of warning - it is BIG! I actually returned it for a smaller one. The watch face is 30mm, which is quite a bit larger than most women's watches. The face was almost the size of my husband's watch. If you like big watches, then you will love this one, it is beautiful, but if you want a normal size watch, I would reccommend that you keep on shopping."
1,"Nice watch, but too masculine","I ordered this and another Bulova watch. This one was way too big and bulky... looked more like it was made for a man. Other than the diamonds, there was nothing feminine about it, so I returned it."
3,Minute Hand Not Working,"Hi, I was excited to receive the watch almost as quickly as I a ordered it. However, the minute hand is not working and I had to call Watch Zone to get an RMA #. The lady on the phone was fairly nice and said Fed Ex would pick up the watch on Monday and she would send me a new one. I didn't quite understand what she meant about sending it back. She said put it back in the box it came in and Fed Ex would know where to send it. I am still puzzled on that one, but anyway........."
5,GREAT BUY,"Get this beautiful watch for your lady. She will love it, and you too. You will save a whole bunch of money if you buy it here."
2,watch,"I loved the watch but the stopwatch resets at 2 seconds, instead of 0.Shipping time was very fast."
2,Better on the Website,"The watch is beautiful on the website, but it is very very small in real life. The three dials in the watch look crammed together and everything just looks squeezed in. Like I said- beautiful online- but so-so in real life. I'm disappointed and so was the person who asked me to buy this watch for her. We are thinking about returning it."
5,great watch & great price in Amazon.,This is a beautiful watch and I paid SO much less than I would have here in Canada! Very Happy. It's NOT too big - any reviews that say any differently must be reviewing the wrong watch.
5,Great Gift!!,"My girlfriend absolutely loved this watch. It has such a sleek look to it, and you can actually read the time unlike many small womens watches. It isnt as big as it looks. IT has to be one of the best affordable watches out there. Five Stars!"
5,Gorgeous!,"This watch is breathtaking! It has just the right size and number of diamonds (it sparkles without looking garish or fake) and a big, easy-to-read face (without looking like you're wearing a guy's watch). It looks especially amazing next to a diamond line bracelet. Get ready for people to grab your wrist and ask where you got it. You will not regret it!"
1,Broken and tarnished,"I was so excited to get this watch, but it came broken with pins lost and discoloration/tarnish around the watch face. Seems like maybe I got someone's rejects :( bummer. Think I will not risk it and but another watch from another source!"
5,Beautiful Watch!,I love this watch. I treated myself to it and I'm happy that I did. Bulova is great quality. I highly recommend it.
4,Nice watch!,"Nice watch! Looks very nice. Elegant yet sporty. Can be worn dressy or casual. The face is just the right diameter. Most of all, my girl friend loves it!"
4,Nice but smaller than it appears,"First of all I want to clear up the misconception that this watch is large. It is not. While it is definitely not as small as most women's watches it is absolutely not oversized. I feel I was quite deceived by the photos that were posted. I thought it would be more like a ""boyfriend"" watch. Even though I am keeping it because it is really nice and it does look quite expensive AND I hate sending things back. I just wanted to warn others of the size and hopefully others will not be misled."
5,What an eye catcher!!!!!,"This watch is just beautiful!! I can't stop looking at it. It is an attention getter for sure, I have had a lot of compliments already. It definatly paid off shopping around, the watch sells for $500 at most department stores, on Amazon.com it was $262. The ONLY downside to the watch would be that it is a bit larger than my other watch, it could be a bit big for a small framed woman. But overall, I love it."
3,"Little uncomfortable, runs little big, HOT !","The shoe runs about 1/2 size big, so get a 1/2 size smaller than your normal shoe. I got this in leopard and it is very cute. The shoe is a bit uncomfortable due to the height. I walk in a lot of high heels so maybe it is the way the shoe is made which makes walking in it a little more difficult. It's not unbearable though - I just would not walk for miles in it or wear it when you have to be on your feet a long time. Very HOT shoes."
3,A good starter to teach kids about the natural world,"This is a nice little educational book that works hard to teach toddlers a thing or two about animals. Each page is divided into panels that have very realistically drawn animals in them. For each page, one of the panels contains a simple one-sentence fact about the animal depicted.Each letter has at least one example, but the more common letters have more animals than less common letters. Children should like the challenge of naming particular animals as they learn them, and adults can easily think up some questions about the animals that can make the book useful for many, many readings."
4,go hawks,"if you are an iowa football fan, hayden fry was responsible for what now appears to be the glory days of the football team, in the 1980s. worth reading."
1,ETA are not freedom fighters,"Okay, I have heard a lot about the film and I'm dying to see it. I think Eduardo Noriega is an amazing actor. The one star is not for the movie but for the review on it. I just have to respond to the other reviewer. What exactly is ETA's story? Blowing up cars and killing innocent people? The Basque are in no way being oppressed in today's Spain. ETA are a small bunch of terrorist radicals that want to impose their ideals on a larger group of people. Just ask the Basque."
2,What about the summit?,"Goran Kropp had a superb adventure but his narrative became exceedingly dull once he arrived in base camp. We had to hear the whole disaster story all over again (with lots of references to Into Thin Air - don't we all know these things already?). Kropp seemed to present his summit as an afterthought. I would have liked to hear much more of that feat and how the ride back home unfolded. Of course the tragedy needs attention too, but I was hoping the book's focus would be elsewhere. In the end, it wasn't."
3,Coldly Honest,"Kropp & Lagercrantz's book Ultimate High is the latest in my Everest obsession which began with my reading Into Thin Air.This book has a proper index (I hate books that do not have a proper index), though it has no table of contents(?)and at the conclusion of the 'story' are excellent lists: Kropp's ""Ultimate Mountain List"" (I had wanted to read a list like this since reading Into Thin Air), Kropp's packing list (hmmmm), and the Special Summiteer List (very helpful & informative).The book was well-crafted and reveals Kropp's thoughts, feelings and actions on his trek. The authors do a good job of letting the reader see what Kropp saw! I liked the book and the story, but at the conclusion, though I admired what Kropp did and how he did it, I didn't like Kropp very much. I was left with the impression of a cold, very self-absorbed, somewhat shallow, ecologically-minded tough-guy.I do recommend buying this book, however; it is worth the purchase price just for the lists!"
2,Goran Kropp,Text is simplistic. An easy style to read but a fascinating story. Well worth reading. The story touches on the 1996 tragedy on Everest and gives some different insights. Some small facts have not been published previously.
4,I have one question.,"I want to know if he hooked up with the reporter chick that challenged him in the begining. It was an excellent book with regards to the bicycle portion of his journey. Not wanting to diminish the efforts and tragedy of those on Everest that year, I am nearly sick of hearing everyones angle on it. One or two veiws are fine, but more than that gets old. I agree with one other reviewer in that I would like to have heard more detail on his climb, and on the return trip."
5,See his live talk!,"My wife and I saw Kropp at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science and we were so enthralled that we decided to see his lecture a second time! He is a very enjoyable, congenial, and has an attractive personality. I read the editorial reviews of his book, which were overall slightly disparaging of his elitism and the ""ham-handed"" story. I can't disagree more. If the reviewers heard him speak I bet they would change their tone.Kropp is a humble and likeable figure who deserves our admiration. I will follow his career as it progresses. Hats off to Kropp, a man who understands the importance of our natural environment.P.S. The book is great too. Too bad you can't have Kropp there to read it to you!"
4,My Friends All Said I Was Crazy!,"At 50 years old I rode my bicycle 3600 miles across the United States. Perhaps because of that experience I had great empathy with Goran. When I arrived home I was met by my entire town, two newspapers ran front page stories about my adventures, for months everyone I met congratulated me but deep down I felt unfulfilled. Goran Kropp rode his bicycle twice as far, across hostile countries, in bad weather, with much more weight. Then he climbed Mount Everest. I applaud his attempts to ""do it all"" with no supplemental oxygen or sherpa support and empathize with his mood swings.Thank you Goran for letting me share your adventure. My only criticism is that it is too short. I would love to read what Mr. Lagercrantz left on the editing room floor. Two questions I would love to know the answers to: How did you overcome the language barrier? and, did you marry Renata?A Must read for anyone who has ever answered a question with, ""because it's there""."
2,Great Achievement but mediocre storytelling,"I expected a much more exciting story given this remarkable adventure. There's a lot of rehash on the Everest tragedy which has already been much better covered by ""Into Thin Air"" and numerous other books. Goran surely has much more to tell about his owh adventure through Europe and Asia and then finally the Everest climb. There is also some spotty editing - maybe the whole book was hastily done."
3,"Interesting story, but too much rehash","Kropp's attempt to reach Everest under his own power, carrying all his own gear, was wildly idealistic, and to forge his own path through the Icefall and, to some extent, remain independent on the upper mountain was admirable. It's too bad that so little of the book concerns his actual climbing. Instead, we get rehashed bits from the bloated ""Everest 1996"" oeuvre, interspersed with historical factoids which either needed chapters of their own or to be edited out entirely. I suspect the latter are the work of the co-author. Kropp sounds like an interesting person, a true ""lily of the field""-type climbing bum, but we hear too little about him. I'd still recommend this book, but readers may find themselves skimming parts of it."
5,Im VERY happy with this order!!,"Hands down this was by far the easiest, fasiest, and best way to order any anime in bulk for your buck! It was wrapped up just right so I didn't have to worry about it being damaged and to top it off the show is AWSOME!! The price was wwwwaaay more resonable then looking around and paying like they say: ""a arm and a leg"" at the store. Im so hooked on getting my other anime from here for now on! :D"
5,Present to myself: check,"This is my favorite anime series of all time. The characters are distinct (if reliant on certain tropes), their antics are constant, and the humor always serves as a bittersweet counterpoint to the insecurities and tragedies each one has had to face. Highly recommended."
3,Broken Case and Ripped Sleeve,"The series itself is great, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes anime comedy. But I bought this set from Amazon directly, and when I got it, the case had been ripped half way down, and the sleeve it came in was tattered and torn. The only positive thing was that the disks were intact. I do dot feel like I got my moneys worth, it was a disappointing experience.I would say 5 stars for the series, but only 1 for the condition of the set."
5,Great anime but....,"I love it. if you like funny and love romantic anime show. It is the one. It is Blu-ray but it isn't full screen. i don't know is it my problem or the discs. I've tried two blu-ray players with different TV too but still wise screen. That's what i don't like. ""come on it is Blu-ray."""
2,BEWARE: blu ray is 4:3 format!!,"I love this series, but I have issue with the Blu ray version being 4:3 format, without the capability to zoom or stretch. I even contacted funimation about this and they said it is not an error... It looks pitiful on my widescreen tv. :("
3,great anime good price! however.........,the aspect ratio is 4:3 meaning no matter what there will be black bars on both sides of the video and yes it kinda sucks it bothered me at first but u get used to it after a while ENJOY.
4,Very funny anime,"I really enjoy this anime a lot. Its funny and yet goes a bit deeper and shows a lot about how ""the grass which seems greener still can come with its own set of problems."" I can't really say if funimation did a poor job with this or not. My eye is not so great that I notice the bad visuals that some people talk about but I have a lot of respect for people who can tell the difference and believe them. Its just common sense that a set of 4 episodes per DVD would have a better quality than extending it to 6 which is almost 3 hours of time on a dvd. 26 episodes should ALWAYS be put on 6 DVDs. not four. I have to agree that funimation uses the ""SAME OLD SAME OLD"" voice actors. At conventions they say they have a pool of hundreds of voice actors, but I sure don't see it.However, the anime itself is great and this is the only option available."
5,An excellent DVD for an even more excellent series,"I received this on Monday and the wait could not be more worth it.First off, this contains all 26 episodes of the series Ouran High School Host Club which was originally done as a manga by Bisco Hatori (which I own 3 volumes of), all in glorious Dolby Digital Surround sound and 4:3 aspect ratio.This does also contain many extras including outtakes every 2 discs for the episodes that came before it (which is the actual voice actors, not the characters themselves.) and commentaries by the voice actors and the ADR director of the series which are hilarious to listen to when watching your favorite episodes and pages from the manga itself. The rest are just trailers and textless OP's and ED's, which is a standard for Funimations DVD'sMy only gripe with the actual CASE is that it's too pink.Seriously..."
3,Decent,I was pleased with the discs but when I got it in the mail there was a hole straight through the case. This confused me because the box it came in was perfectly fine.....but overall its byfar my favorite anime!!!!!
4,Fantastic!,"It came directly to my house! which i loved, when i opened it it had 2 dents, but i passed by it! and no scratch on the disc's what so ever i loved it"
4,Extremely Solid Photo Cutter,"GOOD:I've been using my Rotatrim M-15 for cutting/trimming photos printed at home. I use the Epson Photo R1800 (also top-notch)Epson Stylus Photo R1800 Inkjet PrinterThe Cutter is so solid and the cuts are perfect.The dual stabilizer bars make this hassle free. and the circular blade makes for even cuts with out ever ruining what you are cutting.SO-SO:The little slider it comes with to help use the built in ruler doesn't help much. I'm always afraid that my photo will slide under it and the slide will scratch the photo.Overall: AIf you like to get the best of things, then this is the cutter you want. Perfect cuts everytime and rock solid.The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the slider scares me (yes you can take it off...and I do, but then again, its a selling feature you shouldn't have to take off)"
4,Froggy Bathmat,"I have had a theme of frogs decorating my bathroom for several years now. Occasionally, certain items have to be replaced. It has gotten more and more difficult to find frog bathroom accessories in stores nearby. I didn't realize that Amazon carried such items until I did a search. I was pleased with the price and the product."
5,Bought digital and print,There are lots of lessons in this book and it can be difficult to get them all. This is the third time reading it (now on my Nokia Windows Phone) and I'm still picking up new lessons from Samael.I'd recommend it for any student of Gnosis or anyone who wants to know more about Gnosis.
5,"If you need to learn atari basic, this is probably the book for you",This book was included with my Atari 800 when I bought it new. It is really useful in learning Atari Basic and like the other self-teaching guides is easy to follow. It doesn't assume any knowledge on the part of the reader and can really help teach the differences that Atari basic has such as handling strings. I used this book and so did my brother to learn the language.
2,Somewhat disappointing,"This is the sixth (and most expensive) Department 56 Dickens Christmas Village building I have purchased, and this one is somewhat disappointing. The light inside shows through the snow on the roof, giving one the impression that there is a big hole in the roof under the snow. A little also shines through other parts, like the joints between the shingles and even solid walls.The other five have opaque paint on areas where light is not supposed to shine through."
2,not what I was expecting,"I began reading ""They Fly at Ciron"" expecting a social commentary, and I'd heard good things about Delany as a writer so was expecting something special; and the first few bits of the story were actually rather interesting. However, as I continued reading the story turned from interesting social commentary to something right out of an Edgar Rice Burroughs novel. The story started to feel like an incomplete, immature rough draft, and was full of inconsistencies and holes. Delany mentions in the preface that ""They Fly at Ciron"" is a re-worked version of one of his earliest stories. It rather seems to me he should have worked on it a little bit more. There's the skeleton of a good story, but it doesn't quite seem finished yet. I gave up half-way through."
3,"Not Delany's best work, but still a great read","""They Fly at Ciron"" is another suprising novel from a little known but excellent sci-fi writter. Even while's not my favourite Delany book, this story of a ""ancient"" civilization which meets a much more technologically-advanced one is a book i rediscover every once in a while. An excellent read."
3,"Simplistic, but plenty of action","In this Delaney novel a vicious, technologically superior invader crushes a village which knows nothing of murder, much less war.Expanded from a 1961 short story, the utopian-style village is almost painfully dated. Nevertheless, this short novel is fun to read, primarily for its lively writing and the ingenuity of its technologically innocent characters - brawny Rahm, the clever wily garbage man Qualt and the singer Naa.Their guerilla tactics of sabotage are enhanced by the aid of a flying sentient race that lives in the mountain tops and has a culture somewhere between vicious and benign.The allegorical elements are simplistic but the action seldom falters."
4,"Detailed, Nice Illustrations and the price is right!","Step-by-Step Stenciling is a great book for the beginner and up and coming professional stenciler. The book details different stenciling products and the care of all the products. Great ideas for stenciling on furniture, floors, wall tiles and more. They even tell you what to do if you make a mistake...eek! My personal favorite was the detailed instructions for cutting your own stencils...my favorite thing to do! The best instructions I could find in any of my books and I have lots of them..."
5,Outstanding Review,Marcia Bartusiak is one of the most lucid and engaging science writers of our day. Most everything she writes is worth reading if you are a science buff.
5,Maxtor One Touch for back-up,"The drive arrived on time as promised. It was easy to set up and operated as specified. I did not install the retrospect express software. Purchased full Retrospect 7 instead. It took a little work to get one button working, otherwise all went well. The drive is now functioning as planed and expected. Very pleased with this item."
1,Do not buy...,"Approximately three and half days after I bought it, the Maxtor One Touch II failed. It no longer powers up, the LED on the front does not turn on, and the device is not recognized by my computer. No settings had changed - when I left my computer it was connected, recognized, and powered up, and when I came back a few hours later it was powered down and nonfunctional. I have tried different outlets, disconnected and reconnected every cable, and flipping the switch in each configuration. Since I was using the device as backup during a reformat, I lost about 40-50 gigs of data. I expected much better from an external hard drive."
4,Professional source,"If you want to know all math behind Hold'em, from probability point of view, this is the source. It is not a classical strategy book (maybe many more recommendations for particular hands would be useful), but it really covers all gaming situations in Hold'em. No book I read thus far has such well organized coverage on odds and probability. Holding in one hand a good strategy book and in the other this odds book, you will probably win a lot during time. I recommend it instead of any odds calculator, because you will see here the applied formulas and you will be able to learn and apply the probability calculus for any particular hand or for other poker games."
3,"5 Stars from a Math,Coder View / 1 Star from a Player View","This is a nicely organized mathmatical explaination of how poker odds work. There are some areas missed, like 1, 2, 3 gap connectors. It assumes you understand how to calculate the combinations that make your hand improve but doesn't discount some of the ""improvements"" as being of lessor rank than than the combination on board.This is a raw mathmatical explaination. You might gleam some insight for improving your poker game if you are a math person, but if you are a recreational player looking to improve your ability to calculate your odds and outs, this is not the text for you."
2,2 out of 5,This book makes calculating odds more difficult than it has to be. I gave it a 2 out of 5 because of the extra confussion but it has nice tables. Unfortunately you can find similar tables with the same effect on the internet.
2,Not All That Useful,"This book is all about the math. There is no strategy discussion, and it is ridiculous to think you that you would memorize all the information in this book. If you are interested in how odds are calculated, you might find this interesting. Otherwise, I am not sure what you will get from it."
1,Pretty much useless,"This is a very messy book that is very hard to follow. I can't imagine that the information in here will be of any use to any poker player at all! Maybe a poker software developer could use some formulas from it but I pretty much doubt that anyone would want to work with this book anyway. The book is actually organized but the layout, language and information in it is so bad put together that you probably will give up before you find what you are looking for anyway. This is by far the worst poker odds book I've read."
3,Chopper hard to use,I had an earlier model of the Oster system and thought this one would work as well as my older system did. It does not. The chopper attachment's lid is difficult to close and lock into place. Struggled with it for about ten minutes before I could get it closed. Otherwise it worked fine. Would not recommend this to a friend.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this to replace a Braun MR430, (its motor died after 2 years' heavy use). Compared to the Braun, the Oster's containers are much larger, and it's supposed to have more power. However, this takes much longer time to puree or chop food, and the result is not as fine as the Braun, especially the chopper - with the braun I could chop vegetables into very fine textures in seconds, but with the Oster it takes minutes and there are always some big chunks that could never be caught by the blade! Besides, when using the ""high"" setting there's a burning plastic smell.I wish I had bought another Braun."
5,This company (WAS) wonderful!,"I ordered the Oster 2605 hand blender in October '06,,, in April '07 the plastic on the blending rod attachment cracked in half and I could no longer use it. I emailed the company and in two days I had a reply telling me a replacement rod was being shipped right out to me, no charge. I had the piece a week later. This was the second hand blender I purchased in a year and I really thought I was going to have to buy a third one. I was thrilled at how easy it was to get it fixed.ETA on August 4, 2008, well I haven't owned the hand blender for two years and the blending rod has broken for the second time. Now the blade is slipping right out of the rod when I try to use it. When I contacted the company they tell me I should go to a service center to get it repaired. Looks like no more replacements for me,,I'll probably be shopping for that third blender, hopefully I can find one that can actually stand up to constant use."
1,Do they make these so that they break on purpose?,"I bought this immersion blender about a year ago. Used it 4-5 times since then and it worked great. Got it out tonight to puree some baby food and the plastic part that attatches the blending rod to the motor housing is cracked and the blending rod just falls out. So, the motor still works fine but the crappy design makes it impossible to use. Can't find a replacement part online, so now I'm looking for a new one--but across the board these are made with plastic. Even the ones that look like stainless are really chrome covered plastic. It really makes me wonder if all these companies are making these as throw-aways instead of making them durable enough for 10+ years of useage LIKE THEY SHOULD. I am not happy about sending this to the landfill and buying another one. This one should still be functioning!"
3,"great product, breaks too easily","I want to LOVE this product and for the most part I do. But, I'm on my 3rd one since December 2007 due to the blender (part that attaches the motor to the stick) melting. When it works, it works great. I use it mainly for smoothies and it blends all the frozen fruit without problem. Oster support has been super and have replaced the product each time in under two weeks. I will continue to use it and get it replaced until they either correct the problem or stop sending me replacements!"
4,Works Fine,"i've only used it to make smoothies, but works fine. no issues with blending the ice, but you may want to crack the cubes in half before you start blending to make it easier. also, cleaning is simple. i cannot attest to bigger more elaborate gourmet jobs as i do not possess those skill sets."
2,Too big and heavy,"I was having trouble finding the Braun hand blender in local stores so finally gave in a bought the Oster. Compared to Braun, this product is too large and heavy for effortless, quick blending tasks like blending a morning smoothie. I've already returned it."
2,Good hand blender | Bad mini food processor,"Great for using as a hand blender. Love the slow to fast dial up you can change. It is very loud though. The mini food processor attachment is poor - we use it to chop up garlic, ginger and other fresh herbs. It DOES NOT mince them up, it chops them up slightly and then spits them to the sides. We used to have a Black 'n Decker that did a great job, but they don't sell them anymore. We're gonna try the Cuisinart CSB-77 Hand Blender, SmartStick for $49.99 at Macy's."
5,Perfect - Solid - Reliable - Useful,"We got this as a wedding gift 5 years ago. We're not heavy users. We probably use it once a week, and mostly to blend soup from (relatively soft) cooked tomatoes or squash. But, it works great and shows no signs of wearing out. The controls are easy to use, and easy to control the speed, which is important when you are blending in the pot and trying not to make a huge mess. We wash the blade in the dishwasher, no problems. We've never found much use for the other attachments, since we have a full sized food processor and blender if we ever want to do serious cooking."
2,Broke after a couple of months of heavy use,"It started off very well, but after a couple of months of heavy use (mostly smoothies, occasional in-pot pureeing of hot soups) the blender attachment broke and the blade fell out of the casing. The rubber washer just underneath the blade too broke. I am pretty sure that food entered the tube that holds the shaft. The motor is fine, and I can still use it with the other attachment, but not for its primary purpose. As another reviewer said, these companies seem to be building them to fail.Any suggestions for a durable hand blender?"
4,Customer Service at Oster is great,"I like this little blender. The attachments are fine. The food processor is small and it does small jobs well.The blender itself is great, except don't try and put ice in your glass which is where I went wrong. I bent the blade and it didn't work very well. But I emailed Oster and within 1 day they responded they would replace the blade attachment for free. I have only had this tool for 1 month!Very impressed."
2,Good but new edition is needed!,"This book can be accepted as a transition from analytical analysis to computer aided analysis. Though, it is not as understandable as its analytical version. (Theory and design of small induction motors,1956). Firstly mathematical aspects aren't emphasized enoughly. Second, its fonts are not suitable for a mathematical book. Besides Computer technology is rapidly developing and some new softwares (like Matlab) came into the sciene. Nowadays Matlab is nearly a commodity for technical computing. I think a new version including Matlab Files will be useful. Analytical essentials and the inputs-outputs of the modules may be reminded briefly. Hoping for the new edition. Best Regards."
2,Good but not enough!,"This book may be accepted as a transition from analyitical to numeric analysis. But its flow charts and mathematical aspects aren't emphasized enoughly. Besides, new versions of technical computing languages came out, like Matlab 5. Matlab is very easy to understand, so the matlab files can be used for a new edition. If the flow charts, input-output relations, mathematical basis, more explaining graphs, figures and graphics were presented, the book would be more useful. The analytical version of it (Veinott,1956) is more understandable, but of course not suitable for computer applications. Hoping for the Matlab version. Best Regards."
4,Great mower for the price...,"I reviewed all of the available pull behind mowers, and I chose the swisher because it was the widest with the most HP that I could find. Also, I was close to buying the Agri, but those folks couldn't tell me where to buy one, as Sears was out of stock on them.For the money, this unit is rugged. I did, however, break the drive belt the first day out on it. Probably user error, as I had the tension too tight on that belt.I rate it a 4 out of 5 because it is a bit loud when it bounces around, if you dont have a real smooth lawn. But I am putting it to the extreme, cutting a large area (4 acres) with various slopes, using a Polaris 425cc ATV."
2,A Casualty of Hollywood Musical Politics,"I bought the CD to get a hold of Cole Porter's intellegent score. After a few songs in, I realized the movie score wasn't written by Cole, but by a string of Hollywood hacks (the most recognizable of the bunch being Finian Rainbow's Burton Lane)! What a ripoff! And Cole Porter's broadway score is currently not available anywhere. What a waste of resources (mine and Rhino's).Still...if you want to hear the Tommy Dorsey band at their peak, or hear Red Skelton sing, before his TV tramp days, or Gene Kelly in his prime (Lucille Ball's voice, for the most part, was dubbed by another Hollywood hack, Martha Mears) pick this one up. I figure, when the buying public reads about how the movie moguls handled this project--not giving Ethel Merman the role she originated on Broadway, and replacing Cole's score for a bland, glossy, Hollywood hackjob, this CD will soon go out of print. Nice, bright remastering, though.My two cents."
3,"Good hardware, worthless software","This drive is well made, reliable, and simple to use. However, the Dantz Retrospect HD software bundled with it is worse than useless. It's in that annoying zone of appearing to work, just enough to cause the unwary to waste a lot of time trying to get it to work, without ever succeeding. After several months of on-again off-again results, I have abandoned the Dantz software altogether, and will just use Windows XP to copy the files I want to back-up. I will never use another Dantz software product again."
4,Saved Me From Disaster,"With the Maxtor, I was able to back up my important data right before my internal hard drive died. Were it not for the simplicity, capacity, and speed of this excellent device, I would have lost everything. Thank God for Maxtor! The Retrospect software is also a nice touch."
5,Good items for the money,I purchased this back up drive to back up my laptop computer. The drive was easy to hook-up and the software downloaded with ease. Everything seems to be working just fine. I may have to buy one for my home system. Its nice to have the security of this back up drive.
1,Plug and Pray,"I bought several of these to copy data to some of our clients. I tried installing the drivers from the CD first, then hooked up the drive. Nothing. Just a message from Windows that it does not recognize the device. I don't have the time to mess with searching for drivers for what is supposed to be a plug and play device. I will never buy Maxtor again."
2,non-functional calendar,"Attractive calendar with interesting information, but non functioning as a useable calendar. Each day's block is filled with info and hard to determine actual date in the block from a distance."
2,Mixed Response,"I am reading this to my 13-year-old son. I find it dumb and dated; I can't quite see how other reviewers found anything to laugh out loud about. My son, though, likes it -- he doesn't LOVE it, but he wants me to finish reading it before we move on to something else. It is also not really appropriate for anyone younger than 13, and if you're really conservative (don't want mentions of prostitutes, the F-word, etc.), you won't want even your 13-year-old to see it. I found it on a recommended list of young adult novels online, but I don't agree that it's a teen novel -- it's more like a lame adult fiction."
2,Blue???,This cross is so dark it it black. In bright light you can almost see a tinge of blue. Nothing like picture.
2,ok,My husband and I love sushi. We go every chance we can. I bought this for his birthday. The book wasn't what I expected or what my husband expected. I will have to get another book for him to try more recipes at home.
2,Didn't really care for it,"Yes, it is easy. But it was too easy to the point it was just lacking any interest to me at all."
5,Everything you need and then some,"I bought this book for my sister for Christmas, and after spending quite a bit of the holidays flicking through it I went out and bought myself a copy. I already own a sushi cookbook and have taken sushi making classes but this book renewed my interest. It has good recipes, interesting new ideas (egg cup sushi is something I am defiantly going to try), shopping sources, and it has plenty of colour photos showing methods and just generally making it look great."
5,"Good information, terrible photography",This book is loaded with usefull information and excellent recipes. The photography is terrible. Blurred pictures throughout...
4,"Nice, but...","Made by Sheffield. Pricey. Heavy. Very well made, but I don't really like the slide cutter jutting out beyond the edge of the board. Depending on your angle of approach - particularly on critical cuts - the slide bar sometimes blocks the view of what you're about to cut. Takes some getting used to.Then again, in all fairness, other cutters I've tried with flush cuts (and have worn out) are nowhere near this well made."
4,Cowboy Night Before Christmas,"The story is about two cowboys, one younger and a older. A stranded traveler knocks on the door one night. After helping the traveler the two cowboys find out he is someone very special.This is a very good book."
3,Its Okay,"This is not my best album due to the lack of any beats and a sometimes annoying voice.I personally like that hardcore gangster crunk rap like lil scrappy and others.But songs like Im bad and cant stop are pretty good.Worth downloading if possible, very hard to find"
5,Love it!,"I have had a Rowenta for the last two years and used to swear by it. It died on me, just like most Rowenta customers I've heard about. I thought to try something different since water leaked constantly from it, the cord was hard to wrap around the iron (for storage) and there was no auto shut-off. After reading reviews, I bought the Sunbeam Professional. I really like this iron. It has an extended cord, there's auto shut-off, and there are no leaks (yet). I am happy that my clothes are crisp and doesn't require a lot of time re-ironing the same areas. The iron is a good weight and the price is great! I really recommend this iron to anyone. The only drawback is that I can't see the water level in the iron when filling with water. But to me, that's minor as it doesn't attribute its performance and overall handling."
2,drips all over the place,"I ironed 5 shirts trying this iron out. I really liked the size of this iron and the great non-stick plate. My shirts came out looking sharp. However, this iron drips all over the place. I tried the cotton setting with the steam setting on low, medium and high, waiting for the ready light between changes. None of the combinations worked, and water dripped all over my shirts. I'm not sure how the other reviewers had success; I read the manual and read the sunbeam.com website, tried the recommendations, only to have it drip, drip, drip."
5,Great iron!,"I had another iron that did not have automatic shut off, which I did not like at all, so I ordered this one. I think it is a very good deal for the price. It steams very well and does a good job of ironing. Also, it has not, so far, got a ""film"" or residue on the soleplate of the iron, as my previous one did. It heats up very quickly and has a light to indicate when it is ready. The cord does not get in the way, as with other irons I have had."
2,I guess digital not for me.,"Iron worked great for 3 days and the the digital display went bonkers the iron stopped producing heat. the base was heating up instead of the plate. I was very disappointed. The iron had every feature except the electric cord internal storage. I shipped it back for free and got my money back in a couple weeks. Then I went out and bought it's sister without the digital display. this one leaks water from the cap for the reservoir, but works great other than that. Good luck with your purchase."
1,"Do not, repeat, do not waste your money","What a complete piece of *&^%. It's taking $40 and throwing it in the trash. Water runs, the steam comes through the handle and burns you. The ""buttons"" pop out. By the time you try and get a refund you might as well forget it. I've been an Amazon customer for years, this is a total disappointment."
3,SOLEPLATE NOT SMOOTH,I LIKE THE IRON WITH ONE EXCEPTION. THE SOLEPLATE HAS A COATING THAT KEEPS THE IRON FROM SLIDING SMOOTHLY. A SMOOTH SOLE PLATE WOULD HAVE MADE THE IRON A MUCH BETTER IRON. IT TAKES LONGER TO IRON BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PUSH A LITTLE HARD TO MAKE IT SLIDE.
4,It has been good so far,"We have had this iron for about 8 years and we are very happy with its performance, we only use distilled water for steam, which may account for good steam performance, ie. no scale build up. Our source of distilled wate is our dehumidifier in the basement. We save the summer moisture in cantainers for use in the winter.The main reason for choosing this iron was its value for money."
2,Worked Great...then died,"Bought this iron from a different retailer. It worked great initially, but it just stopped working after about 6 months. It still turns on, but no matter what heat setting you put it on, it does not actually get the wrinkles out of clothing anymore. Very disappointing. I gave it two stars because there's a possibility that I just got a defective one, though that would be strange since it worked perfectly for several months."
3,Just didn't last,"This iron worked very well (good weight and finish, consistent heat) as it should have because $50 is expensive for an iron. I thought I had made a long term purchase but it just died without warning and I seldom used it (~5 times per year for 2.5 years)."
4,"So far, so good....no dripping!!","Had one month, so far no dripping which is the main problem with so many irons. Hope it lasts."
1,Horrendous Picture,"I bought this television and noticed from the first day that the colors tended to bleed into one another to the extent that it was a constant distraction. It also did a bad job with tiny details such as the weaves on a coat or any striped pattern, which always appeared blurry. Anyway I sold it and got a 20 inch Sony which I'm quite happy with. Avoid this one at all costs."
2,BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ,"There is a buzz that is so loud from the back of this sets picture tube. Also The BBe sound doesn't work on video. The one I bought from Amazon had Pink and Purple bloches on the tube, Noticable on whites. Very Good Tv other then the mentioned problems. Velocity scan Annoys me perhaps you will like it better."
3,Left Handed Stitchery Sally Cowan,This is a very good book but very basic. It would be better if it went into more detail and covered more stitches.
5,"Dear MY SCENE QUEEN,","I allready have the my scene goes hollywood barbie,linsay lohan, and the movie.If I were you i would get this doll.******LGP3LNC******BARBIE LUVERBRATZ LUVERMY SCENE LUVERFOREVERIN ALL ENERNIYROCK SQUAREDP.S. END THIS WAR!!!"
3,fed up,"Come on, bratz lovers...cant we all just get along? Brats are awesome,and so are my scene...and another thing.. My scene are NOT ugly...They are beautiful..and so are bratz. So my advice, get over it! Im fed up with this debate."
2,Big Head,This doll has such a big head....I don't understand why the My Scene dolls are like that. The clothes are really nice and the ideas they come up with for the dolls are good but the big head is a turn-off....
3,She looks strange,"Don't get me wrong.I like my scene, but this nolee looks horrible.I don't like the make up much and I think her eyes look tiny.Bratz fans, if you don't like my scene please write reviews in thebratz section instead. Vanessa, doll lover."
3,Stop pressuring Me!,"Okay, Idon't have this doll so ignore the rating. But based on the pictures, it seems that this doll looks some what, funky.The doll house is really complicated. In the box, they give you all the pieces you need. But there is no colour so you have to assemble it and paint by your self. But I guess part of the fun in this doll house is to build it. And the other half is for playing with it.I'm kind of sad that the house doesn't really fit barbies. Oh well... At least You can use smaller kelly dolls to play with it. But this doll house is not really something you would want to play with like a normal doll house, it is more like collectable.over all, it's like bouilding a real house with this doll house and it will take weeks to finish. I still haven't completed it yet but, I will be happy the day The doll house is complete!"
4,Great Clothes! Great Shoes! Great Doll!!!,"Nolee looks so good in this new Hollywood collection. Her outfits are so pretty on her! She has really nice hair too! She comes with one extra outfit, a extra pair of shoes, a popcorn bag, sunglasses and lots more. Her purple lips are kinda wierd but pretty. Also another good doll is Hollywood Chelsea that comes with lots of acessories and is also very pretty.NiCe NoLlE!!!"
3,"The Zeo quest, but *just* that","In the original episodes, the kids searched for the crystals while the Alien Rangers took their place on Earth, and there was a before-credits preview *for* Zeo, and those previews were never, *ever* re-aired... and none of that is on this tape. This video cuts everything but the Ranger kids searching for the crystals. So... get it for the Zeo Crystal quest, but don't buy it expecting the whole episodes. I did and was very disappointed."
3,"If it works right, it's cool!","The keyboard is the best keyboard that I've ever had except I having to hear myself when I type or use the keys. It's thin and has more features than other keyboards including Dell's wireless combo.However, I have a mouse that will work only if I use 1 battery. With both batteries, it won't do squat. The mouse is the best mouse I've had. But with it only working with 1 battery, how do I know that it won't become inoperable?When I contacted the manufacturer, they refused to replace it since mouse worked. I was able to convince them. However, I don't like their terms so this product is going in the trash..I'm not discouraging people from buying this product. Rather I'm saying if it's defective, good luck in getting it replaced....."
2,Horrible range S510,"The range of this Keyboard is a joke, the keyboard works well with 5 meteres and the mouse max 2 meteres, so if you need range dont bother with this product."
1,"mouse doesn't work, keyboard hardly","the mouse doesn't work at all. the keyboard works only if situated 1 meter from the receiver, and pointed directly to it, not slightly to the sides. i don't recommend"
2,A complete disappointment,"This keyboard has been nothing but trouble for me. I believe it might be a problem with the wireless communication, but I'm not sure. The ctrl key only works about have the time, and I usually need to hold it down for a 1/2 second for it to actually work. Keys will randomly repeat for no apparent reason. It's not uncommon for a Win+E to popup 5 or 6 Explorer windows. I'll definitely be returning it."
2,Dissapointed in Logitech,"This is probably the fifth logitech product I have purchased in the last couple of years. Although this keyboard works, like the other products there is clearly a performance penalty for going cordless with Logitech. I gave this to my son and am much more satisfied with a bluetooth product from Microsoft."
3,Wireless Keyboard,"The keyboard functions are just average. Sometimes the arror keys work, sometimes the arrow keys do not work. The wireless mouse seems to function fine. My wife does not like the looks of the black color keyboard. I may continue to use this leyboard, but may go back to my wired keyboard, I am just not sure yet. I like the concept of being wireless, but there are some negatives that are being dealt with."
2,"Good keyboard, but not for over 10 feet","The eyboard and muse combo looked pretty good, and initially seemed to do the trick,however i fyou look at the wa this review has come out, you can tell tere is n isse with it. I am a fast typer, but the keyboard doesn't seem o be able to kepup. I am literally 10 feet from the receiver and the batteries were fres in 2 days ago.I guess if I was on the same desktop this would be perfect, but for me the keyboard and mouse accuracy just can't seem to keep up. W a whole setence!I'll be chopping thi in for a better model, perhaps with bluetooth."
2,limited range,"This is a nice looking keyboard mouse combo. For working at a desk and getting rid of clutter, it works fine. The keyboard is fairly slim and shallow but its works okay. Mouse doesn't turn off automatically.The problem I had was I wanted it to be used remotely with a PC at one end of the room and the keyboard/screen at another side. I have found that it only works up to about 10ft away from the transmitter when bluetooth devices have no problem working at the 15ft range where I need it to work. Therefore, it's pretty much useless for my purpose.Looks like you need to spend more than $100 for Logitech's bluetooth enabled keyboards if you need the range."
4,Great,"The keyboard is great, I love the overall feel of it. it has a few shortcut buttons, but not too many. It also has a few custom buttons you can set for anything you would like. I just wish the mouse that came with the keyboard had the ""side Buttons"" or forward and back buttons."
2,good but problems...,"you may notice i am writing this in lowercase. i am using the s510 keyboard i bought over a year ago. the shift keys suddenly went out so the keyboard is now useless. i have to subtract for longevity. the mouse that comes with the keyboard is poor but i use it with another mouse anyway. and, as noted in other reviews this, in common with most other usb keyboards, only works with basic functionality when hooked up through a usb kvm switch. on the good side, the battery life is very good and i think it looks nice, but i'll be looking for something else for a replacement..."
3,okay but a few cons for power users,Overall look and the feel of the keys is very good as everyone else has observed. No installation problems for me.However the function keys are small and feel awkward. Also the middle mouse button does not seem to generate button code 2 for the X server.I am going to exchange mine for the DiNovo coredless desktop which is on sale on BestBuy for the same price as this one.
3,Not good for fast typer,In comparison with wired keyboard it has a lot of pros and cons:Pros:-The key arrangement is kind of useful-The delete key is tall and useful for programmers and types to delete a letter or word quickly-Function keys(programmable keys)-The mouse is ok-Love the CTRL key(tall and big enough for those who use a lot in programming and design)-Easy to installCons:-Not good for fast typing-Keyboard has a slow communication between its receiver and sometimes miscommunication after fast typing!-Keys are kind of small in comparison with other keyboards
3,"Very Functional, slight lag though.","So, I'm very conscientious about lag in my input devices. I just bought this S510 primarily for the keyboard to use with my G7 mouse (truly superb, by the way). The S510 keyboard works well for its purpose. It loses connection at about 10 feet. In the 0-10 foot range, there is a one or two milisecond lag in this keyboard. Most people will not notice the lag, but I type at 80-110 wpm so it has trouble keeping up to my current word/letter. The mouse however, has little lag. Impressive for the price of this package. Gamers will probably not like the slight lag. If you want a wired mouse that has no wires, ha, get the G7. Feels like a real wired mouse."
4,Good Wireless Keyboard,I only use the keyboard and it works well up to 10~14ft away. Then it misses keys. I have a wired 5-button mouse which wont work unless you disable the wireless mouse.
2,The keyboard is OK but the mouse is awful.............,"I thought I was alone regarding this product. I have had this setup for some time now and haven't been able to use the mouse for more than a 1/2 a day at a time before it takes 5 minutes to get the pointer where you want it because it's not recognizing the hardware. GRRRRRRRRRR! So very frustrating. So, I now use the keyboard with a WIRED mouse. Logitech has been so good to me in the past. I'm not exactly sure what they were thinking with this product............"
4,"Very Good Keyboard, Uncomfortable Mouse","Pros1. Keyboard is quiet2. Keyboard is sturdy and flat on the bottom3. Keyboard keys are easy to press for fast typing4. Multimedia buttons work well5 Keyboard is very stylish6. Mouse is very responsive, works on semi-glossy black surface7. Mouse optical engine is better than mediaplay cordless mouse8. Easy setupCons1. The palm rest is not detachable (but works very well)2. Mouse is very uncomfortable to hold, very bad ergonomicsOverall, the keyboard is very good and I highly recommend it. Although the mouse optical engine is excellent, the mouse ergonomics make it unusable in my opinion."
2,"Keyboard fair, mouse terrible","The keyboard is a bit light weight feeling but is overall a mediocre keyboard. The hot keys were easy to program. I am not a fan of the slim design, but I think I just like a more bulkier keyboard. As far as the mouse goes it is terrible. I have a black desk and the laser is not strong enough so it does not work. I had to go back to using an older mouse I already had. If your looking for a wireless keyboard/mouse set I would recommend spending and extra few dollars and getting a better unit."
3,improvements needed,the deivce is not good enough for me to sit 3 meters away from receiversometimes the keyboard tends to no respond when i type too fast
2,Logitech s510,"Positives:-great design, sharp, compact, many customizable buttonsNegatives:-caused problems with my system, especially my wireless internet. Also interfered with my cd drives. I had these problems after I finally got it installed. Logitech customer service said it wasnt their product causing the issues, but I disagree.-Hard to install, never got it working and decided to return it.Don't waste your time and money!"
1,Only mouse work at first place,"It's hard to use, the keyboard at the first place does not work. Then I have to call for help, wait for so long to solove the problm. This one suck."
4,"Nice, inexpensive replacement","This is a nice, inexpensive replacement keyboard and mouse set. After a few days to get used to it, I have few complaints. One is that the software supplied does not work with Windows Server 2003. I had to search for an older version (3.1) of Setpoint that is compatible. Another issue is that the keys on the left side of the keyboard click as if they are bottoming out, while the keys on the right are pretty quiet. This was a little annoying at first, but not enough to warrant returning it. Finally, while all the F keys are programmable in ""enhanced"" mode, they've silkscreened some icons onto the first 8, like Word, Excel, print and save. If you reprogram those to suit your needs you have to learn to ignore those graphics. It would be nice if they left off the graphics and included a labeling strip that you could customize for your own set of applications or functions. Otherwise, this is a decent purchase."
4,Nice for my HTPC,"I've had this for two or three years now and it's very nice for occasional (maybe one or two sessions a week) use. The wrist rest is a good size for laptop typing, and the key spacing is a tad larger than I'm use to, but it's still fine for touch typing. In my low-usage scenario, the batteries (rechargeable, not included) last quite long--maybe I've changed the keyboard once in all this time. The mouse is pretty standard and I can't say much about it.I find both devices work up to a little over 10 feet, which is just enough so I'm happy. I would buy this again."
4,Logitech Wireless Keyboard/ Mouse Combo S510,"I like the keyboard/ mouse combo, it works great I would recommend that if anyone want a great deal they buy from this seller, and Amazon."
4,great keyboard for the price,"I am very happy with this keyboard and mouse. The keyboard has very useful extra keys that you can use to control a lot of the frequently used programs of your computer. You can configure some keys of the keyboard and the buttons of the mouse. The mouse has two extra buttons that you can configure with what you like. The only problem that I've had is the short distance in which I can use it. I don't know if it is the batteries or that I have the receiver close to electronic devices, but I can only be 6 feet away from the receiver or it stops working. Other than that I would definetly recommend buying this combo."
3,Works good when in range,"I got this keyboard for a friend of mine to use in her classroom. To allow her to use a keyboard and mouse even when away from her ""Smartboard"" device. This is an average sized high school class room. The keyboard and mouse worked fine. However it would not reach all the way across the room. We ended up using the Gyration, which has a great range. If you are just going to use this on a desk, this is a great keyboard and mouse to get."
2,It's ok,I like the keyboard but the mouse is horrible. It's too high and not very accurate when moving in any direction.
4,a good product,"It is a good product as far as I can tell. The range is very good and the keys are good, but could have been a bit softer."
5,Awesome keyboard,"I am really enjoying this keyboard. It's thin & has lots of fun little buttons to program for your convenience. Cordless comes in handy for relaxed time at the desk. Little struggle for MMORPGing, but if you're resourceful enough you can manage.I love it."
5,IF you don't have this keyboard - you're missing out!,"Wow - the most amazing keyboard ever. I am in love with it. Before you read any further....I spend a **LOT** of hours typing. I work with four 19"" flatpanels, two workstations that can melt steel and my desk is a mess.Here is what I think of this keyboard:1) The keystrokes are crisp and short, so its fun to type on2) Its ultra sleek and the colors look cool3) I have all the keys programmed and the mouse programmed. So I can pull up the applications I need instantly.4) With all this trash on my desk...there is a good chance that one of these days I am going to spill a drink on this thing. But no worries, its got drain holes at the bottom.5) I like it better than my MX duo Logitech keyboard.6) THE COOLEST FEATURE: You can secure your wireless transmission from the keyboard to the receiver, so someone cannot snoop your keystrokes.Two thumbs up to the team that designed this thing. Great Job!"
2,poor reception,"I got this from Amazon for ~$50, and the keyboard and mouse works fine, that is if I were to sit within 4 ft from the receiver. I had originally HOPED to connect the keyboard and mouse wirelessly and be able to control my laptop while I'm on the couch and use the tv as the monitor. I am not exaggerating when I say beyong 4 ft, this bad boy does not recognize any key stroke nor movement from the mouse, intermittent response at best at a distance. fyi, my couch position is about 8 ft from the receiver."
3,Good but needs updating,If you're a medical student studying for a board exam this book is not perfect but it is ok. The book needs to be updated on new classes of drugs that are not explained. This book would appeal more to pharmacists and pharmacology majors. Med students can use but it might a bit too heavy to go through it all since the information in there is pretty much extended and you might not have the time to go through it all if your board exam is near. Overall a main resource that has its place on a bookshelf for further reference and clarification. The book is pretty dry and lacks sufficient illustrations and diagrams. If you are a visual learner this might be a problem.
3,Perfectly average and met the need,"This was a perfect compliment to my wedding and allowed us to really customize the topper. The workmanship is a little cheap and the painting nothing special, but it produced the desired effect and allowed us to really show our personalities on our cake."
4,A Page-turner,"I enjoyed this book for the most part. The story is very engaging, though not entirely unpredictable. I'd have to say the very best part of the book is the epilogue from a relative of Hercule Barefoot's. If you enjoy that european-turn-of-the-century feel, this is a suitable book, and the love story is of course sickingly sweet."
3,"Good, high powered stove, but handle with care","Used this stove heavily for food prep at a farmers market. Some assembly required. Generally sturdy, but the gas manifold is not. My friend made the mistake of using the manifold as a handle to carry the stove and she ended up breaking one of the gas orifices off in the cast iron burner. The legs can also snap off easily.Performance wise, the stove works great. High heat output, easy to modulate. the control knobs come off easily and can get lost, but they are a standard size and easy to replace."
3,cool product,"The product was alright; however,I think it would have functioned better if all the componets were connected (fused) instead of them being taken off when you remove it from your dog. Besides that--it was a nice product."
4,Great halter,We've used this brand of halter for years with various dogs. It does not stop the dog from pulling. Nope. But it is a great halter that doesn't choke the dog and we like it.It's durable and I have washed it in the washer inside a lingerie bag. Much better than a collar around the neck.Four stars because it's labeled a Pull Stop halter and it's not.
4,Fit Well and Reduced Pulling,"Did not eliminate Brutus pulling altogether, but it made walking him much more tolerable!! Good Product. I'd buy it again."
3,Swimming in Bergamot Perfume,"***This Decaffeinated Earl Grey Tea from Stash is plain, and definitely not subtle because of a strong bergamot component---way too strong! If you really, really love bergamot you may like it, but I much prefer a more subtle and more complex tea. It tastes like perfumed black tea; I could hardly drink it. I am an Earl Grey fan, but just couldn't stomach this tea.On the plus side, it is naturally decaffeinated, which I appreciate. Also, it seems like the quality of the black tea is very good, though, because even with a longer brewing time, the tea did not become bitter...so, if you can stand being hit over the head with the bergamot flavor, you might enjoy it.Only recommended for those who want a strongly perfumed bergamot Decaf Earl Grey.***"
2,Disappointed,"After reading all the reviews, I was really excited to finally obtain my own copy of ""Vincent van Gogh: The Complete Works (CD-ROM)"". However, I am very disappointed with the quality of images. The capacity of a CD-Rom is 700MB, the CD only occupies 224MB; clearly the pictures can be saved in a much higher quality."
4,"A ""Must-have"" for lovers of Celtic folk songs","With a wonderfully clear voice John Wright reaches across the miles and across the years to bring the listener to a simpler lifestyle. He is a professional shepherd who discovered that he could sing, and he brings a richness to his music that can only come from the simple life of a shepherd. His band is amazingly simple - a guitar, a violin, and a voice, giving his songs a level of comfort that is welcome. He was recently featured on National Public Radio's ""The Thistle and the Shamrock"" program. I particularly loved his song, ""What's the Use of Wings"". If you are a ""free spirit"" (or know one) listen to this song. It is worth the price of the whole album."
4,Superb video - fair processing,"This video is a superb visual accompanied by well played pieces. However the transfer was not well done. The original is in high definition widescreen. The video resolution of the transfer is not much better than standard VHS. It was probably transferred from broadcast tapes rather than from the original This could have been transferred with a wide screen option, but instead it is in a cheezy letterboxed format. The sound is excellent. In addition it has no chapter markers, so it is difficult or impossible to find sections you would like to replay.While high definition will give a much better picture, standard DVDs can produce excellent results. We may have to wait quite a while to see a good resolution version because it may take a while for the format wars to subside, and the price of players come down.The quality of the video only partly eclipses the poor processing."
5,And great work or everyday cologne.,"I purchased this cologne not knowing what to expect, and I must say I was truly surprised. It really had a great smell to it. I just use it for work and maybe lounging around the house, but the wife and every one at work has commented on this cologne. The best part about it, it's cheap. I. Have 8 bottles of cologne $150 to $300, and for a cologne much cheaper, it serves it's purpose. Would definitely recommend this cologne."
5,Love The Smell and So Does Everyone Else,"I Love this product, the way it smells, the ease in applying and Everyone who encounters me with this scent on, seems to HANG CLOSE to me...(SMILE)"
5,Eactly what i wanted,Eactly what i wanted. I buy this for my brother for christmas every year and he loves it. Delivery was quick. I have nothing bad to say.
5,All was great!,"Came fast, just what I ordered! My boyfriend likes this scent. I however am not crazy about it, but that's what he wanted."
2,Clever but cold,"There were a few poems I liked in here, but unfortunately this book is less than the sum of its parts. The voice is smart but smug, which is still okay in small doses. By the time you finish the book, you're sick of it! It's repetitive and boring. The author may write in verse forms well, but ""verse"" isn't enough. There has to be wisdom (not cleverness) and humility and feeling in poetry too, which this book lacks. Overall, a disappointment. Try Rafael Campo or Brenda Shaughnessy instead."
2,only metal parts included - don't expect the glass tray...,"I ordered this twice and both times received only the metal parts in the photo (not the frosted glass part). Then, Amazon didn't de-list the item, but told me that I could not order it again. Very strange. So I bought it on E-bay for half the price."
5,Pure Caro Mastery,"It would seem that in order to put out a volume as well written as Caro's would take quite some time, however 8 years between books seems like an eternity. I read the Power Broker as assigned reading as an udergrad for a public policy course. I liked it so much that I had to get both of the Johnson books and they were both impecabily written. If you have already read both of the Johnson books and are hungering for more Caro then you may try the Power Broker, I think it is the best of all his writings."
5,My Gateway Drug for American History,"This volume is probably not as good as the 1st or 3rd books in the series, but it is still one of my all time favorites. Caro is clearly an obsessive researcher, and sometimes he gets bogged down in providing context. But he completely delivers on his objective of showing how Johnson acquired and used political power.To the extent there are flaws they are crimes of passion. Caro has such intense love/hate feelings for Johnson and the detail and storytelling are incredible. Quite simply this series sets the standard for non-fiction writing in my mind."
5,Stolen Election,"The 1948 Texas Senatorial race is the centerpiece of this outstanding 2nd volume of Caro's epic biography of Lyndon Johnson. Caro spends the first half of the book documenting Mr. Johnson's ""war years"". The second half is devoted to this controversial election. Mr. Caro's writing flows and he does an outstanding job of setting up time and place. I cannot wait to read Volume 3."
5,A fascinating look at midcentury American politics,"Riveting reading!! Caro is a wonderful writer who makes history read seamlessly and smooth, more like a novel than a true story. Yet, the subject, LBJ, led a life that seems more fictional than not. As the story unfolds, one begins to take sides and root for justice which is not served for years after the period described herein. Caro wisely ends the book with the happy ending of LBJ's opponent who lost the '48 election but won the ultimate prize - the admiration of all Texans and a new family. It is apparent that he also won Caro's admiration, even affection. Coke Stevenson should be the subject of his next book. Thanks a million to Mr Caro for his efforts and marvelous skills!!"
5,The amazing story of Lyndon Johnson,"Absolutely spellbinding! A man who did so much good AND so much evil...chronoicled with warts and all. Few presidents have exerted such influence and shown such smallness of mind at the same time. Caro shows us the complexity and motivations of a politician born in the age of William Jennings Bryan and wielding naked power in the age of Vietnam and atomic weapons. Amazing and a MUST READ FOR ALL HISTORY BUFFS.The reader will come away from this book<READ VOL 1 FIRST> saying ""wow!"""
4,Texas politics LBJ style,"This biography covers Lyndon Johnson's career through the 1940's; his setbacks, his confusing war record and most compelling of all, his run for the Senate in 1948 against his unsuspecting opponent Coke Stevenson. One can both be repelled by the skullduggery employed by LBJ in the campaign, and at the same time admiring of his energy and sheer gall. Caro gets right to the nitty-gritty when it comes to ballot-stuffing in south Texas in that era. A dirty business indeed, but that's politics.Robert Caro does a fine job bringing LBJ to life. I don't think he necessarily despises his subject as some here have suggested; Johnson was a product of his time and place, mostly a tireless seeker of votes above all, and Caro's book reflects that. LBJ did everything he had to do to get elected, and certainly dirty tricks were a part of politics well before today's ""attack-ad"" era. Nothing has changed much."
2,Repetitious,"I was so pleased with Caro's first book about LBJ, ""Path To Power,"" that I ordered the 2nd, ""Mean of Assent."" I'm into the 4th chapter of Part I entitled, ""Too Slow."" It is not too slow; it is too repetitious of material in Path to Power. If the rest of the book is like this, I will regret having purchased it. I suppose that the author wanted each book to stand alone. If that is the case, he is losing a lot of readers who find the repetition very unsatisfactory."
4,"a disappointment, but still excellent","Caro seems to hate LBJ, and in this volume he sees only the ""dark side"" of the man. It is a les full portriat than the first volume, which portrayed Johnson in his full moral complexity. This volume is at time so black and white - contrasting a bad LBJ to a ""good"" Coke Stevens - that I worry Caro is losing his touch. Caro is a brilliant writer, one of the best political historians we have. While I am critical here, there is certainly much he uncovered as the great reporter we trust, such as LBJ's do-nothing period during WWII, that others missed; as such, this is still first-rate and compprehensive, even if the interpretation is oddly skewed. I hope that the following volumes will make up for the gaping flaws in this one.Recommended with caution."
5,Exceptional Biography,"The research that went into this book is phenomenal. Other biographies I've read pale in comparison. And it is so well written that even though I'm feeling like I'm taking a college course, I also feel like I'm enjoying a stimulating novel. Not something that will be read at one sitting but a book one looks forward to having some time to get back into it."
1,damaged goods,Item arrived without its handle--only a broken spot to show where it should be. I haven't used it yet because I intend to return it.
3,PMBR Great...but,"The PMBR books are great...but buyer beware...if the book is completely marked up and all the answers are circled in ink etc., it is virtually useless. If buying it used, pay attention to how used the seller says it actually is.Happy studying!"
4,"Jewish Soul Food, etc.","This book was quite interesting, with the stories and history included with authentic recipes from past and present. I found recipes that I thought were gone forever, and they were good, too! I would recommend this book to anyone who wanted to make some foods that Mom or Grandma used to serve."
3,A Neat Plan - Borrow before you Buy,"This book explains one family's approach to teaching their children to understand money.I believe this book offeres interesting ideas on how you might best develop the ability to manage money in your own children.The book provided me with some ideas on how I could develop a program that parents could use to not only teach their children to understand the game of finances but how to teach children that income is directly related to providing one or more services to others (like earning an A in a course or doing a good job on the lawn).I borrowed this book from the library and decided to jot down some notes and return it. My advice is that you consider doing the same. If you think, after reading it, that it is something you need as a reference as you go through the years of raising your child then buy it for your reference shelf."
3,not bad,"kinda cheap, more for small fish, not medium. construction of these bolts isnt all that good, u can tell there made quickly and cheap. 1 of 6 bolts was not made rite therefor useless, all the others i had to rework them w needle nose plyers so they would function properly. made only for 1 specific crossbow cbfx 100"
1,shoddy arrows,very cheap very shoddy construction. As soon as I opened the pkg points/tips fell off the bolts and you are supposed to retrive fish with a piece of thread tied to a staple in the plastic bolt that falls right out. Shipping is inflated too!
2,Disappointment,"I gave this as a gift and was very embarrassed because it tore when my daughter put it on her extra tire of her Jeep. Now, I have to find another tire cover that will not tear."
2,What a Huge Dissappointment,"If you are a true fan of the music and talent of Ray Davies and the Kinks, then this CD is not for you. It was hugely dissappointing. This was a very poor attempt at cover versions of Ray Davies songs by the artists on this album - at best, mediocre."
3,A 50-50 effort,"However much of a genius Ray Davies is, it is possible to break one of his songs. Fountains of Wayne, Bebel Gilberto, Matthew Sweet (whom I normally don't like) and Yo La Tengo do great things with the songs they've chosen to work with. Steve Forbert, Jonathan Richman (whom I normally DO like), Lambchop and Ron Sexsmith do horrible, cruel, awful things to their songs. There's more good than bad on this album, but just barely. I'd have an easier time forgiving it, I think, if my favorite Kinks song -- which also happens to be the title track -- hadn't been among the ones that got butchered."
4,Worthy tribute,"I keep going back to this CD, again and again. A must-have for anyone who appreciates Ray Davies. A couple of duds (Josh Rouse, Jonathan Richman) are overwhelmed by awesome covers. Some performers opt for straight-rocking versions (Queens of the Stone Age on ""Who'll be the Next in Line?,"" Fastball on ""Till the End of the Day"" and Cracker on ""Victoria""). ""Better Things"" is a great opener, an upbeat way to start any day. Matthew Sweet turns in an epic ""Big Sky."" The haunting ""Art Lover"" as done by Lambchop is one of the most arrestingly disturbing yet poignant songs ever written. Ron Sexsmith captures the longing tone of Davies in the title track -- which says so much in so few words about Ray's romantic attachment to one's physical place in life. The arrangement (with producer Martin Terefe's looping bass) displays power in simplicity. And the closing live version of ""Waterloo Sunset""...well, this one song earned Ray Davies a place in popular music's hall of fame."
2,Very Disappointed,"Out of the 160 pages of this book only about 20 are actually about English Springer Spaniels. The remaining 140 could be about ANY breed, the information in them is so generic.There are many wonderful pictures of Springers in this book and while that was enjoyable the lack of actual information about the breed was a grave disappointment.If you're really looking for excellent information about Springers one book I would recommend is ""The New Complete English Springer Spaniel"" by Julia Gasow & Edward K Roggenkamp. Their book is wonderful, and FULL of information. In fact, it's actully two books in one - the first half being about field-bred Springers, and the second half being about bench-bred. It's well written and well illustrated, with the only downside being that all the photos are in black and white.So that's where I'd go for something more educational. If, on the other hand, you're just looking for a pretty picture book, this one will do nicely."
5,Great Reiki DVD Real and helpful,I teach reiki all levels and this Reiki DVD by Ian Welsh is great he is a real Reiki Master. One can tell that he has a deep commitment to reiki. I use 5-15 minutes of this DVD in my Reiki Classes I show different sections in each class .I am very grateful that he did not include any process that should be learned in a in person reiki class. I find it very helpful.So glad he did not include history of Reiki .As information keeps getting 'found' it would be not be updated. My students also tell me they get alot out it .

1,bad business practice,I bought this tool knowing it would be cheap and hoping it would last for a month or so to finish a project I'm working on polishing small bronze statues. What I received was a non-functional tool in a package that had already been broken open. The rivit holding the handle of the tool on had been drilled at an angle making it not hit the trigger. What kind of seller puts a useless tool in a broken package into a box and ships it to a customer?
5,Profitable Stock Speculation for the Non-Professional,"At last a book is available that presents an approach to speculative profits that does not make unrealistic time demands on the individual employed in a non-market related activity. It is written by an ""outsider"" - an engineer by training - whose only connection with the professional market element is through the commissions he pays his brokers for executing transactions. He presents a synthesis of professional methods adapted to the realistic constraints that 99% of us must live with.--- excerpt from book's dustjacket"
3,boot covers,"Not big enough to fit over size 11 work boots. Not water proof, resistant. Good for more of a medical setting etc but not for muddy boots. Not saying that it is a bad product, just not right for my needs."
4,Fits all shoes,"Nice large covers, with right sized elasticized opening to fit relatively small women's shoe to large workman's boots. Good enough to hold up for single use. Anti-skid provides decent traction on slippery hardwood floors. Good price for the product. Using it to leave at properties being sold, as well as at home for visiting contractors."
5,Great value for the price,I use these in my open houses for buyers coming through. It eliminates them having to take their shoes off and makes it more comfortable for everyone involved. I would strongly recommend buying the Extra Large covers since they provide the best foot coverage and one size fits all scenario.
3,NOT THIS ONE ....,"I suppose I was spoiled by Citro's other books "" The Shadow Child "" which kept me up nights yet, couldn't put it down or the follow up book "" Guardian Angels "" . This book was originally published sometime ago under the Title "" The Unseen "" and now marketed under "" Gore "" .Sorry Mr. Citro, this one doesn't cut it . I am still a fan of yours bringing myths and legends to us all ...so on to the next one ."
5,I will be heard,This is one amazing book. It really gets you to think about every little thing around you. Is there someone out there just watching you? This is a great read for anyone. You won't be able to help to turn the next page. Great book. It was coolBig Truck
4,LOTS OF FUN WITH THIS MERMAID,"My kid's in her ""mermaid phase"". She has fun with this doll and a few other mermaid Barbies I purchased for her. Fun in and out of the tub. The tail on this version can come off, but you have to ""click"" it back into place. She really likes this doll. Lots of fun!"
4,art lesson is a picture book,"I Spy Shapes in Art is a great introduction for young children into the world of art. Each two-page spread contains, on the lefthand page, the words ""I spy with my little eye and a certain shape to look for. The right hand page contains a large reproduction of a work of art by a variety of artist from around the world.This is a neat twist on the old game I Spy. A complete art lesson is one simple picture book.I would recommend this to kids ages 4-8 who are interested in art. It's great for children and parents to look at and discuss together."
2,I Spy Less than I Hoped For in This Book,"I think this book points out a big problem with ordering a book that has no age rating. I was very disappointed in the simplicity of the book, and also the price was too much for the contents. I wish for a good age rating system for children's books. If I took the time to go look at every book for children that I wanted to buy, then I would buy locally. But, that is not possible because Amazon offers a huge selection that I could never access locally. So I suggest a better industry-wide age rating system for children's books."
4,A respectable theory on a complex case,"Maruna's ""Mad Gasser of Mattoon"" is a thought-provoking read. Though the book is short, the author has nonetheless gone through lengthy research and painstaking deduction to come up with a feasible explanation behind one of the most mysterious cases in Fortean and cyptozoological studies. Kudos to this worthy debut. Hopefully, the author will share his views in other enigmatic entities such as Springheel Jack or strange beasts like the Dover Demon, Chupacabra, the Flatwoods Monster or the famed Mothman."
5,Outstanding!---A mystery solved!,"Well written, entertaining and factually correct, this is a great little book. Many accounts of the Mad Gasser dismiss the whole affair as a case of mass hysteria. This book reveals the truth. It's a great little story that's begging to be made into a movie."
3,The Wit and Wisdom of Abraham Lincoln: A Book of Quotations,I had read another version and that was far superior so was disappointed with this version. I thought that it was the version I had read previously. My fault for not choosing properly.
4,Enjoying Lincoln!,I didn't realize that Lincoln was so humorous until I saw the movie. The book is great reinforcing the movie.
2,Unsure read,The book seemed to be put together by several writers with differing opinions. Was disjointed and hard to decide what the main theme (if any) the book took.
2,Who Picked These Quotes?,"Seriously, out of all the wonderful writings Lincoln left behind you probably couldn't find a more disjointed and irrelevent collection than this one."
4,Nice gift,"History buffs will enjoy this book, which I bought as a gift for a friend. He finds some wise, witty and profound quotes in here."
2,Okay,"Although I feel President Lincoln was great, the book is average. This is strictly short quotes with no insight into the man behind the statements or the actaully meaning of his words. This would only be useful for quick quotes for research and nothing beyond that element."
5,Walton complete series,Watching the Walton's enables us to sit down as a family and watch something much better then what television has to offer today. It is excellent television viewing at its best and I so wish wonderful shows such as The Waltons would come back...so the whole family can enjoy programming as such. I'd purchase more episodes if they were available. Two thumbs up for The Waltons!
5,Inspiration Food!,"When you're looking for inspiration to lead your team, this is the perfect food.Be prepared for generous servings of pride of ownership,innovative approaches,hard work and a caring,human touch combined with gutsy risk-taking ability! The recipe works for all customers, whatever their mood,appetite or circumstances.On the surface,it appears to be the opposite of ""Neutron Jack's"" 'tough-guy'approach but deep down they both share a common management style-cherishing and valuing employee contributions at all levels."
5,GUTS! is GREAT!!,"Great organizations today cast away the ""command and control"" style of management, flatten the organization chart and leverage the talents of ALL employees. Kevin and Jackie Freibergs new book ""GUTS!"" talks about these organizations, why they are different and why they succeed. They write, not about average leaders, but about exceptional ones who innovate, take risks, hire great people and then work hard to help them succeed.Mario Hieb, P.E., Consulting Engineer"
5,It takes GUTS to not be a sheep.,"The Freiberg's have written another compelling book with GUTS!, and they represent their compelling vision for organizations with clear examples and straightforward recommendations. This book is as usable as it is inspirational. Read this book if you want to help your own organization become better, or if you want to help other organizations improve in what are viewed as non-traditional ways."
3,Angle of view issue,"Functionality is not a problem with this products both thermo and hygro.ITs the angle at which you look at the reading.From the sides 45 degree able, its almost impossible to read"
1,Doesn't keep correct temperature,I was very happy when I purchased two of these thermometers and put them on oposite sides of my tank because the side with the heat lamp was 90 degrees and the other side was 80 degrees. I purchased a bigger heat lamp because we wanted more heat on one side of the tank. Neither of the thermometers ever moved. I put the heat lamp directly on them. One of them moved a couple degrees. I had to take them off the tank to test further which leaves a nasty residue for you to deal with and neither of these thermometers work. I don't know if they just were not meant to be shipped in standard shipping or what could have happened but I am very disapointed. I am returning these two to Amazon and will go purchase some at my local pet store. I purchased this brand because it is the same brand as our tank but I will not be purchasing this brand of thermometer again (I still love my tank).
3,"Good, but longevity not guaranteed","i would say, go digital.These are fairly accurate thermometers however if dropped in water or rattled around too much they can get stuck in the same spot for ever.This can be bad because you may think your reptile or whatever your keeping has the correct temps and it may not.Digital thermometers with a probe on the end i would say would be your best bet.The digitals are only about $8 so i'd say thats much more worth while than one of these.Also once applied to glass they make a sticky mess on terrarium walls if you ever need them to be removed.One last note, the hygrometer (humidity guage) of the same make i would not recommend at all.I've had a couple and they fall into the water and get stuck at 70%,60%,etc forever.If you cannot tell if your herp or reptile has enough humidity i simply suggest you mist their enclosure as needed."
1,Do not stick on mesh,"I have a mesh cage for my chameleon, and these thermometers do not stick on the mesh walls. They fell off very quckly and would not stay on."
1,So unaccurate it could be dangerous.,"This Thermometer is as inaccurate as you would expect an analog to be. People who say its amazing probably havent had the chance to compare it to a digital one. I've chucked mine in a dark corner after a couple weeks of use when I saw a pretty cheap digital one.Decent digital thermometers sell for as little as 8 pounds and are far far more accurate and far quicker to respond. Dont risk your reptiles health, spend a tiny bit more."
5,Fantastic look back at history,"This book has made me hungry for more Minnesota , dakota territory history. It was absolutly amazing to look at life through the eyes of such a strong woman. To take a glimpse back in history and to recognize the places that you now know but yet cannot imagine in this other time. Just fantastic!!!"
1,Rev A Shelf 4asr15aAjustable Doormount,What I was needing was a Cabnet for Seaoning So I need to sent what I have backAnd look a little moreWho can help meThanks a lot's
1,Not as much help as I had hoped...,"I was under the impression that this would be an answer key for more drills than just the listening drills. All that it does is fill in the blanks of the single listening drill per chapter of the second Al-Kitaab fi' Ta'allum al-'Arabiya book. This is only minimally helpful.Ideally I would have wanted an answer key to the rest of the drills, so that I could make sure that the hours I spend doing drills isn't in vain. (I currently spend hours doing the drills incorrectly)."
5,Functional and Cute,"I purchased this backpack for a trip to the mountains. It worked very well during day hikes and exploring new towns with my extra layer for warmth, watter bottle, camera, sun screen, hat, etc all stowed in the backpack. I am now using it around town I find very functional - lots of convient pockets to hold my mobile phone, mp3 player, pens, wallet, keys, etc. I also love the color!"
4,Great sturdy comfortable back pack,"I bought this back pack for a trip out west to a number of places including Yellowstone, San Fran, and Crater Lake. The bag was exactly what I was looking for. It is large and roomy, easily holding my camera and accessories, a travel book, a large 3 ring binder, and numerous maps, and has a water bottle pocket on the outside as well as a slot for my iPod cord which is useful. It is sturdy and well-made. I inspected the back pack and haven't found any pulls or tears after its 2 week journey. It is also comfortable to wear over 1 shoulder or both. In the past I've only had LL Bean back packs so it had a lot to live up to, but wasn't interested in spending $50+. This was a good purchase for the price, met my expectations and I highly recommend it."
2,Wouldn't recommend,"I bought this backpack last year because of the price. I used it to carry books, etc to and from class, not for outdoor activities.Pros: The bag is lightweight, which is very important for me. It also looks nice.Cons: The pockets are awkwardly designed. I like to slip off one strap, reach around, and grab something in one of the small pockets. The smallest pocket, however, is vertical and the zipper is on the top when it's closed. I had a hard time reaching the zipper with the bag on one shoulder. The medium pocket is large, but it would have been useful to have more zippered pockets inside. The shape of the zipper is also awkward and made it difficult to quickly grab something inside.In addition, the backpack got a hole in less than a year; my previous Jansport, which cost around $35, lasted a few years."
1,Product is an EPIC FAIL,"I was so excited about purchasing this shaver and the possibility of a close shave but when it arrived and after using it, I was extremely disappointed. I couldn't tell that it did one thing and I followed the directions using baby powder often. I wouldn't recommend this shaver to anyone."
3,Works fair,"These items work fair only on very short hair on flat areas. Be careful, the bikini line trimmer will cut skin."
3,it is just ok,"it does the job, however it takes forever to do it. i would have been happy with just the trimmer. You do need the hair extremely short stubbles in order for the battery operated razor to work. it does do very delicate areas with no worries, and no irratation afterwards. i paid $40 for both the battery operated boby bare binkini line and trimmer. i would not pay any more than that."
3,Body Bare,"Not as good as advertised. The little shaver is pretty useless, and the trimmer itself can only remove the very shortest stubble. Also it takes so many passes that sensitive skin is subject to a rash from it."
5,Shaving your penis and genetals,I have to tell you the body bare shaver is great .It does the job that not even a razor can get i been shaving for almost 3 years .My pennis has not been smoother ever my genitals smooth You have to be able to take about 20 min. to do a good job .I highly recamend this produt Il; never shave with my 5 blade razor again Guys no razor burn i dont know why those other reviews are bad but this product does the job every day moleman
1,Mirror,Not happy with this at all. The mirror shakes and vibrates so much it's useless. It's a big difference from the factory mirror I still have on the passenger side. A waste of money.
1,Throws Exception Shocking,Is this book a joke? It appears that the authors closely paraphrased the Silverstream documentation and added gratuitous screen shots for filler. One wonders if Howard Block and Al Dunn even develop applications with Silverstream?
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"There is more self promotion and self serving praise to Howard Block than there is substance. He is certainly getting by in the industry without posessing a grasp of technology. Why anyone would buy a book written by Howard is amazing to me. When you read his writings you wonder how this guy ever graduated High School, let alone how he became a self proclaimed expert of anything. Howard completely re-writes the Silverstream On Line help databases and his book is no more than a blatent copy of what Silverstream has already written. Don't buy this book, unless you are Howard Block's Aunt or Uncle and want to give him money for no reason."
2,This book is a high level description of SS.,Most of the information in this book can be found at either the SilverStream web site or other articles found in technical journals. There is no detailed infortmation or code examples. I have never seen so many misspelled words or incomplete sentences.
3,"Great Start, disappointing finish","I thought I had a keeper on my hands for the first few chapters of this book. The hero was an extremely sexy bad boy, the heroine was someone I could identify with, and the tension was sizzling. Then...*pfft* from the moment the hero takes off with the heroine into the swamps, the story fell like a souffle after the kitchen door is slammed. It wasn't BAD, just unremarkable. A let down after the great start. If you are looking for an excellent Cajun bad boy story, try THE LONG HOT SUMMER by Wendy Rosnau (SIM #996)."
4,It's a Keeper,"This is the first book in the Brand series that I have read.I am rather ashamed of myself for not reading the others.This book is full of love and hardship on both the hero and the hroine, Jake and Sara. They go through a long agonizing time together, but you feel yourself relating with the caracters and you know it is love. I would highly recommend this book to any first time reader, or a long time reader of Maggie Shayne. She really knows how to kick up a good story. Happy reading!"
4,Good company for Ariel,"She is a nice mermaid doll, I picked her over Barbie and Christie because I like her aqua colored tail. I love mermaids, so I bought her as well as the Mermaid Fantasy Barbie and Kayla (Barbie had pink hair and Kayla had orange hair). Those mermaids were discontinued I think. They are all good ""company"" for all my Ariel dolls!"
2,a tail gone bad,"The tail does not stay on for even a moment! My little girl gets very upset and I have tried glue, but being a water toy it fails. I hope they fix this problem in the next model, I will not purchase anymore of this version."
1,Awful,"I bought this thinking that the tail falling off was a fluke (no pun intended). However, I bought two of these and the tail refuses to stay on. It is not a fun toy to play with in or out of the bathtub. My four year old has already discarded it to play with her durable toys."
4,"Authentic whistle, but needs tweaking.","I've read from multiple sources that this whistle is good, but may need tweaking by a professional whistle tweaker. After that it's great."
5,Yummy and delicious,"I actually owned a copy of this book, but ordered a copy for my nephew who has recently gotten into bagel making at home.I tried the basic water bagel recipe and not only is it easy, it makes the most delicious , yummy ""bakery"" type bagels.I used the bread machine to make my dough, my nephew made them by hand and they tasted exactly the same!The recipes are easy to follow, and based on the basic bagel success, the book can prove an valuable addition to any baker's library."
3,still trying,"The jury is still out on this one. It had a bunch of tips and tricks to try, but i am still getting flat, wrinkly bagels even though I followed the recipe exactly. Can anyone tell me how to make an excellent bagel???"
2,Not Useful For Anyone With Experience In The IT Industry,"Anyone working in the IT field with two projects under their belt and an IQ greater than 50 will find this book a waste of time. Do yourself a favor and don't blow your money on this.If you are just setting out on career in the IT industry, some of the content will be very usefull."
5,This is a must have book,"Finally a simple step by step guide on how to successfully implement a Customer focused operation center. This book is a straightforward ""Non-Techie"" path to achieving a results oriented service delivery team. It is a must read for anyone serious about containing cost at the same time satisfying their customer!"
3,An adequate review of the topic,"a small, concise exploration of the topic; some good ideas and good thoughts on a rare topic. Probably would have benefited from a broader view of its topic. Not a bad book though."
2,It confusing Services?,"This book is very formal approach to IT services. Please don't give it to your customers/clients it will scare them. If you need humor or analogies to make things clear consider another book.The book is very hard to read with wordy sentences. Simplicity is much better, and this book makes some things even more confusing."
3,"Excellent, Outstanding Praise and Worship, but....","The music presented on this DVD is similiar to their CDs. Its clear, concise, and inspiring. It seems that Israel Houghton is finally getting some overdue credit, he's brilliant in his music development and bringing you into presence of God.Now the critique. The amount of money that was spent on this project must be have been extravagant. If that was case, a little more care should have been added to the video editing. At times, I felt like I was watching something akin to the ""Blair Witch Project"" with all that cutting, poor focusing, and imagery not in sync with the song. This may sound a little harsh, but luckily, having seen Israel and New Breed in concert recently...I know better.Hopefully, his next venture in DVD land will equal his hard work and musical talent. This one fell short."
3,Great worship if you're just listening,"The worship is definitely an experience that is one of a kind. If you have the CD, you know that the worship is just awesome. However, I was very disappointed at the way in which the DVD was done. I brought it for my sister as a Christmas gift, and I was a little embarrased. The editing was horrible. I felt like I was watching an old foreign movie that was being translated. There were times where I literally had to just close my eyes and listen, because it was so distracting to watch. I pray that then next DVD/VHS project he does is of much better quality. I don't really watch the DVD anymore, I just listen to the CD."
2,Not too good.,"The DVD received was in excellent condition, but the movie can't compare to most in the same vein of storytelling--so my disappointment is not with the company which shipped it, but with the movie itself."
4,"Excellent presentation, fun and easy to learn","Donald and Kasia present each of the dances clearly and in detail. Multiple camera angles are used and after each has been demonstrated, both mens and ladies positions, with proper timing instruction, they dance it with music. In my humble opinion, these lessons are easily worth five or six weeks in a dance studio. Save your money, buy this DVD. You'll be on the dance floor fast."
1,HBR Reprint,"Don't waste your money on this. It is a reprint from Harvard Business Review, September-October 1989. If Amazon had actually indicated this was the case, I wouldn't have paid for it. Don't make the same mistake I did."
2,Items too near to expiry date,Pfizer Consumer Healthcare Zantac 150 Tablets 150mgBought 3 bottes of zantac. When item receive all 3 bottles 6 months to expiry date .
3,Works for about 2 hours,"I fogot to take my prolosec on a trip to Canada. i went to drug store there, but they don't sell prilosec in Canada, so I bought Zantac 150 instead. This works and works fast, but only for about 2 hours. And I didn't want to take another pill just after 2 hours, so I would drink milk and non acitic stuff the entire trip and took Zantac every 6 hours or so."
4,German accoustical high-art,This is a band that makes a music that has an unbelievable magic. The classical composition of a rockband is supplemented in some songs. You don't have to understand the lyrics but if you do you will be even more confused than just from the melodies. You're feelings will alter between a light summer-breeze and the drowning in a bag with stones. An excellent record.
5,beautiful book about the Archangels,"This book is absolutely beautiful. Simple to read and understand. The artwork is also beaufiful. Great information about the Archangels and how we can work with them to make our lives better. It talks about how each Archangel has a specific ray of Light that shines down on the Earth more strongly on specific days of the week, and how we can work with the Archangels and their Light so that we grow spiritually. Wonderful book for yourself or as a gift."
5,Fantastic,I found this book very interesting and informative. It is one of the best books I have read for the information I was looking for on the Archangels.I am thrilled that I now own this book.
5,Extraordinary,"As a collector of nature-oriented DVD's for our children, I have seen a number of impressive documentaries, the best from BBC and David Attenborough.""Life in the Undergrowth"" ranks at the very top."
5,very nice!,"I do not like insects and worms. But, I love this DVD. The quality of camera work and truth of insects are really wonderful."
2,antiquated program and info.,"I liked that's why I gave it 2 stars. Nevertheless the documentary has obsoleted and out-of-date content. The price to me seems too pricey for the quality and the narration content; I enjoy the imaginary of the insects, you will be able to see close enough many insect, but the resolution its blurry thus details are left out."
2,"Awesome Insect Documentary, but has a terrible anti-God agenda","The footage about the insect world is truly fascinating. Quite frankly, I wasn't too excited about watching a show about bugs, but through this show gained a much better appreciation of the insect world. Unfortunately, the makers of this documentary couldn't just stick with facts. Instead of just presenting facts they littered the show with the THEORY of evolution, dismissed God's wonderful creation....It definitly had a pro-evolution, anti-God agenda. One has to be incredibly blind to look at creation (bugs, animals, plants, the human body, the cosmos, et.,) and not see God's handiwork in all of it....the fact that He alone created it all, and He alone sustains it. By the way, there is absolutely no scientific evidence whatsoever of evolution..never has been, and never will be....don't buy into the lie."
3,The creationist,"This would have been a four star if they had stuck to the biology of the insects rather than their ""origin"". Really annoying if you don't believe in the evolution theory."
1,Full of Evolution,We were all very disappointed with these DVDs.They were FULL of evolution. Too bad that thebeautiful photography wasn't just shown withdescriptions of the the little critters. Theevolution was throughout...couldn't just skipa few spots. Just wanted to notify otherCreationists.
5,You can't go wrong with films from the BBC very good one,When you combine David Attenborough with the BBC you produce an excellent educational documentary about nature. This is another well done movie on insects and other strange bug behavior in the wild. I continue to enjoy these educational films and continue to recommend their purchase to old and young alike. You can't go wrong spending money on this type of movie.
1,will not play !!!,"ad says coded for u.s. but will not play on u.s. players, what a shame , what a waste of money !!!"
5,Life in The Undergrowth - Doesn't get any better than this,This was a fantastic video. I really enjoyed it thoroughly and have watched it several times. The time and hours of preparation to film are greatly appreciated in order to bring this to the public. Outstanding
5,Amazing!!!,"I gave five stars, but meant ten. I bought all the documentary series narrated by Sir David Attenborough and love all of them. The ""Life in the Undergrowth"" is my favorite one... or maybe not - as all the series are wonderful. Don't even think twice, it's a must have in your collection."
5,stunning and beautiful,Almost any review listed will tell you all the wonderful things this DVD has to offer. i will say that i have viewed (and repeatedly reviewed) many of the works of the BBC and David Attenborough and yet i am still amazed at how much i love every new DVD i get from the paring.
5,Best show on Insects ever!!,Ive had this video for about 5 years and decided to but it on Prime Video as well that way I can watch it from whichever TV I am in front of at home and don't have to bother with reaching for the DVD. The cinematography is breathtaking and Mr. Attenborough's narration throughout the entire 6 hour video places you in some form of hypnotic trance. I don't think there will ever be another documentary focused solely on insects as thorough and as breathtakingly beautiful as BBC's Life in the Undergrowth. BRAVO!!
5,Beautiful,"The filming of this miniature world is perfectly doneNarrated my David Attenborough is as always hypnotisingAnd incredible look in Large empires of the insect worldNo expense was spared on the makingI have bought it to add too my collection which includesPlanet Earth, Blue Planet, Living Planet, Life in the FreezerA must DVD to own for nature loversThanksBuddha"
5,Life In The Undergrowth,"This DVD set is fantastic, it has stunning screen shots that will both fascinate and intrigue and at times send chills down your spine, the world of insects as we know it can never be thought the same after you watch this masterpiece; and the fact that David Attenborough narrates makes it all the better.~MTChaput"
5,Captivating!!!,"Please do not retire. This is of the same high standard as Life of Birds etc. Truly informative, photography of the highest quality given by a man whose enthusiasm and knowledge keeps watchers spellbound and part of a hidden world."
4,The End Of The Universe,"This CD is great. But the first one was greater. This and the White album are a problem if you are listening in the car on the highway, you will laugh a lot and be dangerous. This is the best comedy I have heard since Brother Dave Gardner. I would recommend listening to The End of the Universe first, and the White Album second."
2,Disappointed,"I've always found his comedy central performances to be excellent but what appears to be left over after CC gets done cutting is vulgarity and a decidedly LEFT view of America. Too much profanity and too many politics for my taste. When he ventured away from both, I enjoyed myself again. What a waste."
1,"Excessive ""Filler"" not Explicit Lyrics.","The comedy central performances are a riot! In this CD Lewis uses vulgar ""filler"" words not to enhance the joke sequence but in an apparent attempt to impress an intoxicated audience. Timing and deliverance with the great style used on the censored T.V. acts are much better. After buying this CD I feel a need to shove a pencil in MY ear!"
4,Awesome,"I, like pretty much anyone else, first saw Lewis Black on the Daily Show and always likes his 'Back in Black', mainly because he is really good to point out stupid things that kinda show western society is in its downfall.Of course September 11 is being discussed and even though he is not the first to discuss Airport Security it remains funny, though George Carlin has the best bit about it.My favorite part is about the end of the universe in Houston Texas, where there are two Starbucks right across from each other. It's hilarious, made me think of 'Best in Show'.If you like 'Back in Black' you will certainly be entertained by this, with the F-word!"
4,He's Funny,I don't agree with all his underlying politics and sentiments but he presents his view of things in a hilarious way.
5,Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Paste Pomade- Wonderful product,"I have used this produce for a couple of year's and love it. Suddenly I could no longer find a salon that carried it. Delighted to be able to have purchased it on Amazon (for half of the price I had been paying previous). I change by hair style often. From a short style to a chin lenght bob which I have now. It smoothes (with out weighting it down) and takes care of static at the same time. I use after drying and right before finished styling or using hair spray. I use it in all seasons. But one must be careful to use very little. I skim it with my nail and rub hands together to distribute evenly then just lightly smooth over hair, finish styling and thats it! I love this product."
4,"Love this stuff, hard to find outside of Amazon","I have been using this paste for 10 years. It changes formulations every few years, but the basic workability is the same. Works great in dry hair. I took one star off because it can occasionally cause an occasional clogged follicle on the top of my head. But that's not enough to stop me from using it every day.It used to be easier to find in retail stores. Now I just order it from Amazon."
4,Great hair styler,Use just a little and work through your hair to make your dull dry hair look lively. I've tried other products and this works best for me and best of all its made of soy so its not damaging to your hair.
4,"Thorough, well-researched bio of Lombardi","This is a very good book, but not a great one. Vince does well describing Lombardi through his actions and the impact he had on those around him, especially his former players. Everything is written in a clear and easily understood manner, especially his paradoxical nature.However, it does not clear my threshold as a great book. A great book would have involved me not as a viewer from afar, but as a fly in the locker room. Since O'Brien did not play for Lombardi, I was hoping for more insight of how his players felt. I never got emotional reading this book, and emotion is a large part of what Lombardi was about.Basically, it reads like an exquisitely written research paper."
5,"the best organized, most comprehensive text available","I have been using Futuyma's Evolutionary Biology in various editions since 1983, when it was my undergraduate evolution textbook. Nowadays, I'm the professor. In my opinion, the 3rd edition is simply the best textbook for a college evolution course there is. It is organized in a logical manner, emphasizing conceptual issues and not marching up the geological timescale or across the phyla, or getting bogged down in lengthy case studies. I have considered other texts, including Ridley, Freeman and Herron, and Strickberger, each of which has some unique qualities, but Futuyma's book is scholarly, thoughtfully assembled, and provides as comprehensive a coverage of micro- and macroevolutionary ideas as is possible in a 700 page book.The book could have more color pictures, and the coverage of systematics could be a bit more substantial (but as it is it is superior to alternatives)."
1,Tough to follow,"Being a Molecular Biology major, I decided to try out an Evolutionary Biology course. I came across the text book of Futuyma and I regret it. This text was very poorly written and my T.A.'s, as well as professors, always had to correct student's interpretation of what the book was trying to convey. In my opinion, for every 10 pages read, only one paragraph was coherent and useful. From my experience, including many others, this book was horrible and was sold quickly after the semester of Evolutionary Biology was done."
1,so so,the product itself was ok. not very flavorful in receipe I made calling for this. Also took too long to receive this item anf too expensive. I actually found this item and it only cost 1.98. am mad at myself for paying too much for a spice that i only used once.
3,Strange...,"I am feeling ambivalent about this hand cream. On the plus side, I LOVE how quickly it sinks into my skin, making my hands moisturized but not greasy. On the other hand, though, the smell is really off-putting. I don't tend to mind scented products, but this just smelled bad to me (and to my roommate, who commented on the odor about 30 minutes after I had applied it - it lingers!). I also felt that the moisture was not long-lasting. Obviously I'm not expecting to be able to wash my hands a hundred times before my skin gets dry again, but I had to reapply this cream to my hands after each wash. That was a hassle. I almost wonder if I got a bad batch or an expired product because everyone else has nothing but nice things to say about this lotion. Overall, I think I'll use up the rest of my tube and then not repurchase, as this just isn't my favorite."
3,sebamed hand and nail cream,"Disappointed in this product. I LOVE the Sebamed hand and body lotion, so was hoping this would work great on my dry nails & cuticles as I live in the high desert. So far I haven't seen a difference from a regular good hand cream like the Cetaphil cream. The scent is also a bit too perfumy for me."
4,Exacty as advertised.,"The Everlast Slimmer belt was everything the advertisement said it would be. I've yet to use the hot/cold packs, but they seem like they could come in handy if I were to ever need them. It drains the fluid out of my stomach and after I take it off, I feel pretty good. Like many other slimmer belts, The only real complaint is if the velcro sticks out a little bit on the sides, it will chaffe your stomach. A lot. Not knowing, it chaffed my stomach for a good few hours, and after taking a shower and going to bed, they blistered up. Big time.. So i have to scrunch the velcro towards the middle, which is easily solved, but makes it poke out and look weird like I have something protruding out of my stomach. Other than that, it is a great belt, and well worth it."
5,good,pretty good product. helps me a lot with back problems. easy to use. it really does get excess h2o after workouts and such.
3,Garfield's author,Book arrived with label from the library it was bought from I knew it would be used but did expect that much use of pages and cover...as it is a gift and not able to find new it suffices as a collection book for a Garfield fan... Interior pages all in good condition. Cannot remove library tape label so leaving it on but disappointed with that
5,Great Pictures that Explain Everything,"This book is a great for anyone starting yoga..it guides you through everything:breathing, meditation, nutrition, exercise, and more elements of yoga. There are hundreds of different exercises to do, each with detailed, step-by-step pictures that explain the exercise. If you want to start yoga..THIS is the book to buy!"
5,much more than a beginner's manuel,"i bought this book over thirty years ago. i still feel that it is a great help to me, in keeping myself physically fit. so wonderful that, even though it is out of print, i was able to replace my ragged old copy with this well preserved one."
1,Wreaths pictured are very unattractive.,"I was very disappointed in the wreaths that the author was going to help me make, because as many as there were (a lot) I found them overloaded with decorations, unbalanced and nothing I would make to give or sell. The step by step ""recipes"" for each wreath did have some helpful tips for the novice."
1,It is less than a page,"I was happy to find a bio on Leontief, but this item is a very small bio (1 page of dates). The entry gives less information on the Leontief than what can find anywhere online."
3,I love the Steelers but this was disappointing in quality,"I have recorded most of the game on a HDTV recorder. (Power failure in the neighborhood with 2:42 to go in game, power restored with 0:27) Was hoping to recover some of this lost time. When I opened the DVD, I was greeted with SPAM previews of non related up and comming movies.??? It is NFL type highlights, nothing like live HD content. Picture quality was standard. The DVD container says ""STANDARD VERSION presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of its original television exhibition"". I enjoyed the behind the scene footage and audio from the sidelines and players. Probably will never watch the half time show?"
4,Terrific,Excellent DVD ... very good season long compilation of the greatest run in superbowl history but an underdog ...terrific.
4,Not the Pitts,"If you're a long-time Steelers fan and suffered through the mid-`80s, weathering the dissapointments of super bowl interceptions and multiple AFC championship match losses.... well, then, this DVD is for you.It has the feel of a well-conceived, well-setup, and decently written ""Game of the Week"" episode. The opening sequence, which sets up the recent losses in order to play up the back-story of Bettis returning for one last season, and rallying the team on to toal victory, is very well done.The telling is totally Steelers-centric, glossing over every potentially image-tarnishing controversial moment of the playoff games and the superbowl win. Steelers fans (myself included) will not mind one bit."
3,"Brilliant Post-Season Coverage, Sub-Par XL Footage","The regular season & the playoff games were covered VERY well...especially the game against the Colts.But the actual Super Bowl itself is BARELY represented on this DVD. While I understand that the game against Indy was the better game, this was supposed to be a DVD of the freakin' Super Bowl itself. The playoffs & regular season should be extras, not XL itself."
3,Don't count on using the CD,The CD with this book will not run on Mac OS X+. Who knows what's on it?
1,useless,These items don't reduce odor enough to make it worth the price. Keep the can clean and take out the trash. Lysol is your friend. End of story.
2,Just So-So,"The product has a good premise but fails to deliver. I did see some minimal reduction in odor. The main problem is functionality the stick on holder is made of cardboard if anything damp gets near it when you trash can fills up it begins to fall apart. A simple fix for Simple Human would be to construct the ""Holder"" out of a thin velum like plastic that could be wiped off if it got wet or dirty."
5,Greatest Little Internet Book Around,I thought this was a great book about the Internet and how it applies to our daily lives. It put Internet ideas and concepts in an easy to understand format. I bought a couple copies just to give out to my friends.
5,Great Read,"This is one of those books that make you think. It's a lot of fun, but check out page 97 if you want to get the idea.If you know about the Internet, this book may give you a new point of view; if you don't know the Internet, you will after reading this book."
5,The Waltons,"Good, clean entertainment. It's fun to be a part of the Walton family. The characters are so well played you almost feel like you know them."
4,more good memories,Takes me back to 70's. Just a great family show thatyou will not find made today Which is too bad
4,Another great season!,"I love The Waltons,and this was a great season some of my favorite episodes are The First Day,The book,The Song,and The Lie was pretty good one. But there is a few episodes I do not care to watch that much or are kind of boring are,The Matchmakers, The Beguiled,The Venture and The Marathon. Those episodes were the only reason I did not give this product 5 stars.Make sure you do not miss this season!"
5,As Good as Being There,"I saw these episodes when they were first broadcast. This repackaging brings back memories-only better. Of course, TVs are better now, but the quality of these DVDs is first rate and the end result of viewing is better than I ever remember. The packaging is beatifully done. An altogether satisfying experience."
5,Family Entertainment,I purchased this set for my grandma and she loves it. Best prices in the market from Amazon once again.
5,3rd Season of the Waltons,Wonderful as always! One of the best family series to every grace television.
4,EXCELLENT SHOW STILL A BARE BONES RELEASE,I enjoy this show and the fair price is a plus. I would really like to see some sort of bonus material on these releases. The DVD has a good transfer. I deduct i star for no bonus material.
5,Another Great Season!,I am enjoying many wonderful memories of my youth watching the Waltons all over again! This season has been the best so far. I hope the next season is released very soon. This was when television was at it's best!
4,1960's Fun.,"My mom had this book and I have the book for one recipie: Peanut Butter Press. THE BEST. There are some other great recipies, but the Peanut Butter Press always stop eaters in their tracks."
3,Mediocre Book on Baking Cookies,"Published in 1963 my copy has many basic cookie recipes that can be found in other cookbooks. There are a couple of colorful pictures found between all the pages and some attention is given to different types of frosting, toppings and glazes. She also tells you how to have a cookie party, 1960's style but unless you collect cookie recipes or cookbooks from this era I think you will find better books on baking cookies then this one."
4,Taiji 13 Postures by Master Liang,"This video is another high quality product from Master Liang. His taiji appears effortless but is full of power as he exhibits the principle of steel wrapped in cotton. It is appropriate for serious beginners and intermediate players alike. Oh, and it's a pleasure to see Helen Liang, Master Liang's daughter also playing the postures; she has learned well at her father's knee. The applications are an added bonus to this excellent DVD."
1,Wrong Connection Size,"The product description and packaging states the end of the hose contains a 3/8"" female connector. Opened it up and there is no way it is 3/8"", looks more like 5/8"". I had to return it."
1,Regulator & hose kit,"I purchased heavy duty signle propane stove (model 330973) with recommended LP kit (F273071). When using, stove create heavy black film on cooking pans and cookware. We checked with Home Depo where we purchased the gas tanks, Northern tools for their stove and Mr. Heater.Reading one of the posting, it appears low pressure kit is not suitable for the stove we purchased.Two questions:1. Does low pressure kit cause black film during cooking?2. Should we use high pressure kit and which product number we should use?"
1,Bad quality - full of scratches,"Despite comments saying this is a brand new product, some the CD's came completely scratched. Episode 3 didn't work at all and some of the others would get stuck in the middle of the episode. Totally unacceptable."
5,An amazing gem of a series -- a love letter to Sao Paulo in the late 2000s,"This series began shortly after I (like Alice) moved to Sao Paulo. It is a love letter to that amazing city, just as it was emerging as the new center of the universe of South America. A gritty, complex story of an extraordinary young woman who never thought she - or life - could be special, and how she comes to life in the 'wonderland' of the gigantic, teeming jungle of skyscrapers and ambition.This story is not only a must-see for Brazilians, but also for anyone who loves - or misses - one of the truly remarkable cities in the world.(Here is hoping the DVD comes with the original Portuguese language track intact, because HBO - for some reason - obliterated it for a silly and trite Spanish dubbed track in U.S. on-demand broadcasts...)"
2,It is not very actual book,"As you can see if you read the book, it is not the competitive advantage of nations, but firms. Nations cannot be competitive, because who made the competitiness are the organizations."
2,Movie Writers Are Not Better Than Ever,Mr. Tolkin writes very bad and awkward sentences. History line is predictable and his people ordinary cliches of a certain set. That it takes him a long time to write a book is a blessing for readers
1,One of the Worst Books I've Read,"I loved the movie and really enjoyed the first book (though on a second read recently wasn't as impressed as I had been originally). But this book was painful to read. The characters were not believable. The story went nowhere. Tolkin seemed to use the space to rant about every topic he could think of. And, in the end when Bill Clinton joins, it was simply ridiculous. Don't bother with this book. What a disappointment"
3,From the sublime to the ridiculous,"This rather facile sequel by Tolkin is a quick and easy read, equivalent to an aerosol can of air to clean your computer keyboard. Nothing's in there. The story is totally ridiculous, and contains none of the Hollywood insider insight and parody in The Player. If I were to tell you that it's a happy ever after, live with two wives, and go from studio mogul to the president of the United States, would you believe me?"
5,Catcher in the Rye's Cousin,"This is a superb freshman effort for Charles Blackstone. The prose is phenomenal, but takes a bit to get used to. I discovered Blackstone quite by accident and this work will be one that many will come back to read once a publisher really gets behind him and does a little publicity. The book is clearly influenced by the nuances of Chicago life and the authors own experiences. What did Hemingway say? Something about good writing is truthful writing. Blackstone has made his first mark! Read this book."
3,Working with Handplanes (The New Best of Fine Woodworking) (Paperback),"In general, the book has good information, nice and illustrative pictures all over the place however, the order of ideas is mix since it does not follow the introduction made in each chapter, it goes back to block planes very often and the pictures in the pages do not follow the author explanation."
4,Excellent basic Web Design book,This book has all of the basics needed to get off on a good footing when starting to design Websites. It includes a solid review of HTML for those of you who still use it (instead of a WYSIWYG editor). I am using it for the textbook in my new online Web Design course
1,Outdated and not the best info on Communications theory,"I am trying to teach a course from this book. I would not recomend it. The book clearly shows its age. In terms of communications theory, it is not expressed very well. I would look for newer books on HTML & CSS. If you still want to learn more design and theory aspects, look for Exploring Web Design (Design Exploration Series) by Jeremy Vest, William Crowson & Shannon Pochran."
4,The Vatican in World Politics,"This book is very good for people who want to know the truth behind Vatican. Vatican is not religion, she is actually the international organized crime"
3,From Back Cover,"An Assignment From Hell... And Just As Hot!Police officer Laura Carter is willing to expose herself to danger every day. But pose as the wife of fellow cop Clint Marshall for the entire weekend to crack her latest case? No way. It's hard enough resisting his sexy cowboy charm at the station! Then again, since they're supposed to be lovers, she might as well be as convincing as possible...Clint has no illusions about melting the ice he is sure runs through Laura's blue-blooded veins. All he wants to do is solve the case and head back to Texas. But the longer he plays the passionate husband of this stunning ice princess, the more he wonders if she'd let him heat things up between them for real!"
4,A welcome relief,It is indeed difficult locating information on RAF Blenheim operations in WWII. This forgotten and much maligned aircraft type did the best job possible considering its design limitations and the foe it faced. It is rare to locate a book covering all aspects of Blenheim operations to help fill this gap in RAF history. This publication is a welcome relief.
4,Power In The Blood,"This third album from Brixton's finest,sounds like a call to arms.Great production and excellent songwriting,coupled with a contagious energy,make this album an essential purchase for any fan,as well as being an accessable starting point for those unfamiliar with the band."
3,"More Techno, Less Acid-House-Gospel","If you are looking for another Sopranos theme song or ""She Don't Dance to Tekno Anymore"" you will be disappointed by this record. Power in the Blood offers less of the blues/techno tinged grooves of that made me play Exile and La Peste over and over again. Don't get me wrong, this is a good record and a must- have if you're a fanatic like I am. It is, however, much more techno and much less acid-house-gospel.I will buy anything that A3 puts out, but this is my least favorite so far. There are some great moments on this record, but when you compare it to Exile (one long great moment) and La Peste, it's not as strong. This review sounds kind of negative, but it's not. I would buy this record again. A3 set their standards too high with their first two outings."
3,Great Sex Tips,I like the fact that it was fun and an easy read. It's not like some books that have the tendency to be boring and overdrawn. Great Tips on how to keep it spicy. It's a keeper.
5,Love this book!,"I am not the type to read! Ask anyone that knows me well enough! However, I started reading this book and love it! I find myself pulling it out of my bag at red lights, while I'm waiting in a drive-thru and even at bed time! I have learned so much from this book and I'm not even done reading it yet! I would definitely recommend this book...even if you think you know everything already! It will probably turn out that you don't know everything and you'll be in awe of what you do learn that you already didn't! Happy reading!"
5,"Excellent Bedside ""Tool""",I was so excited to finally get my hands on this book and I could not put it down! It is a great bedside tool even for those who think they know everything about sex and how to do it! :) It is also a great book for men to read ~ or to read together in bed! I highly recommend it!
5,Make Your Valentine's Night Steamy !,"I drove to 3 bookstores and over 25 miles just to get this book. And boy oh boy was it worth it ! I cant believe the wealth of information thats tucked beatifully into this hardcover. I think of it as a ""passion bible "" of sorts...lol with all of the goodies we need for a perfect night. Every night should be a night to remember and with this book your partner will thank you!"
5,Finally a book that gives you tips and secret techniques to keep your relationship RED HOT!!!,Everyone should read this book!! Check out the 7 Day challenge! You can even win a 7 carat diamond ring!!
5,Passion Parties,This book is an educating page turner. I was surprised to see how well it was put together. I couldn't put it down. There is tons of good information in this book.A MUST READ!!!
4,Pretty Good!,"I thought this was a pretty good book overall. I'm an avid reader but I've never read any of Rochelle Alers books. I'm glad I chose to purchase this book. I was very impressed with her writing, she is a clean and classy writer, none of that fool talk and no explicit language. I will definitley be reading more of Mrs. Alers books. I would reccommend this book to all. Ps. without giving away too much there was one part in the book that I thought should have been written better towards the end. Read this book and to see if you would agree with me. Once you read this book you'll get what I'm saying."
4,good easy read,"Three strangers come to McKinnon Island because of circumstances in their personal lives. Dr. Hope Sutton, an advice columnist, has the answers for everyone - but why is her own love life in turmoil? Rebecca Owens, wife and homemaker, has lost herself and is looking for more in life than being someone's wife or mother. Theodore Howell, a famous scriptwriter, recently became the legal guardian of his much younger half brothers and sister who are dealing with the death of their parents. All come to the island seeking refuge but find much more. Good book."
3,"An OK Story, But...",1. It had parts that were predictable and trite.2. It had long streatches of plot that was sometimes boring and uneventful.I certainly do not see the 5 star quality of this book. There are many other books that are WAY better reads.
2,Boring book with boring characters,"I picked up this book from my library and I am glad to say that I didn't buy it. This book is so incredibly boring, I'm trying to wade my way through it. There are three main characters, and I am struggling to find a reason to care about any of them. They are all in typical situations: Hope's bf left her for a man, a bored housewife, and a screenwriter taking care of his orphaned siblings.The book takes so many typical turns. At Theo's first introduction, I knew he and Hope would have their eyes on each other. Rebecca had so much spite in her, that she's hard to feel sorry for. Theo, well, he just didn't invoke any feelings from me.I really have no real interest in finishing this book. I checked out many books from the library this week, so hopefully they will be more interesting."
4,Very good,Rochelle Alers is a good author. She makes her books a very easy read. I would suggest this book to all adult readers.
3,Slow read,"I wasn't very impressed with this book. I found it to be a very slow read, boring at times. A little too predictable."
5,"Old dogs, new tricks","My handwriting's still nothing to, um, write home about but it really has improved a lot with this book. I've only done the first section of exercises and haven't had time to get to the rest, but I like the practice format and the clear examples and how the authors incorporate some very interesting historical information about orthography and writing systems from around the world. It certainly makes the practice process entertaining and educational."
4,Another printing!,"FYI, this print is currently not available from Amazon. Amazon *does* have another print of this book - just re-search on the same title, and look for the other printing with a publish date of March 2005 (and a bit less attractive cover, IMHO!).I've heard this book is great, but haven't yet seen it. If my opinion is different after my book comes in, then I'll come back and update this review (or write a new one on the new print)."
1,Internal Revenue agent,"A real waste of time, effort, and money. Nothing like the online assessment, or interview. Probably like the hiring process ten years ago."
4,A Good Book on a little-known battle,I read this book in three days last August and it is a good account of a battle that hasn't been covered very well in the English-speaking world. What makes this book even more interesting is how the author connects it with the 1410 battle when the Teutonic Knights were decimated by the Poles. If there were only more books in print on this little-known front of the First World War
4,No Problems!!!,"Bought these to have a matching set of four. Although ""R"" Woodworking is a good place, wish I had bought all of them from Selby Hardware. Price at Selby was way better!!! Would purchase from there again."
5,Evelyn Waugh: Selected Works.,"I'd been wanting to read BridesHead ReVisited. It was nice to have some other works included. Handfull of Dust was a glimpse into a world, with which I was completely unfamiliar."
5,Very helpful,"The book does a nice job with breaking out the various destinations and gives a lot of helpful hints. The book also has a lot of space on what not to eat, how to drive, how to get around and other helpful tips. There is so much information to cover, the book could stand to be a little longer."
1,Maxtor One Touch II will lock you out,"I've made numerous attempts to like this product. But when it comes down to protecting my data, the Maxtor One Touch II has failed me every time. After each formatting, with the resultant loss of data, I was able to use it again. That is, until it mysteriously shows up as a ""Locked Drive"" when viewing it in My Computer. The final straw was when I did a complete backup of my new Dell XPS 600. Took 4 hours. That data is now ""Locked"" on the Maxtor. I don't recommend to anyone that they buy this device. It is too unreliable. There was a software update that was supposed to fix the problem. Well, not on this drive it didn't. I'm not a computer newbie. I've successfully replaced just about every component that can be removed from a computer. But this has been a futile waste of time. Maxtor, I hope you are listening. You owe me one."
1,Maxtor - NO STARS,"DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE, OR SIMULAR, IT WILL LOSE YOUR DATA, TYPE MAXTOR TOUCH II INTO ANY SEARCH ENGINE AND YOU WILL FIND ENDLESS CASES OF PEOPLE LOSING THEIR DATA.THE ANSWER FROM MAXTOR - ""JUST FORMAT YOUR DRIVE"".THATS GREAT, IF YOU DON'T MIND LOSING THE 200GB OF DATA YOU HAVE JUST PAID $150 TO STORE.THANKS MAXTOR !!"
3,Maxtor One Touch Review,The product doesn't seem to be designed for Mac's Very well you can not use the One touch button on the Mac which is probably the best selling feature for the product.Had trouble saving files when I first purchased the product but after I had a friend reformat the drive to a Mac setting the drive works fine still One touch does not work but as a drive it seems to work fine so far.....Good drive for the price once you work all the bugs out....
1,Lost EVERYTHING!,"Stay away from this HD! The whole idea of external HD is reliable storage of information, if it can't do that, what good is it really? We lost all information including pictures of my baby for the past year and half, that is the biggest loss for me. I hope I can recover some of them from online albums I have shared over this time."
5,"Easy, easy, easy","This was the EASIEST installation of hardware/software that I have ever experienced. If you're looking for a way to backup your hard drive, this is it!"
1,"Only four (4), yes, four days...","That's the amount of time my Maxtor Onetouch lived. Believe it or not, four dys, It didn't drop on the floor, never got overheated (I constantly checked that), I backauped about 60 gb and by the fourth day, while palying music during 20 minutes, suddenly I only got silence. I restartes three times my computer, started playing again music and everytime got the same problem. At the end, when I connected everything again after a reboot my E drive was ""corrupted and unreadable"". Never unplugged it directly without the ""safely remove software option"" for XP. In sum, a piece of cr*p. DO NOT BUY ANY MAXTOR PROCUCT. Unless you only use your electronic for four days..."
1,Very unreliable item,My drive is a replacement unit (but brand new) for a previous failure of a One Touch. Today I have lost ALL DATA for the second time with a Maxtor One Touch product! Don't buy this item. I'll never do it with a Maxtor external drive product.
1,Do Not Buy!!!!!!!!,"Please do not support a product like this. It deserves 0 stars, because it doesn't work. The shipped software is incompatible with XP. The on-line support is worst than being put on hold for 3 hours its so slow.Do Not Buy a product that will not work when you try to install it. Save yourself the headache."
1,Retrospect Software Crashed My System,"The Retrospect software included with this drive is critical for the ""OneTouch"" feature, but be warned, It will crash your system. I installed everything according to specs and once the Retrospect software was embedded in my system, all I got was the BSOD (blue screen of death). If you try to uninstall the software, your system will BSOD before the uninstall completes. The only way I was able to remove this vile program was to boot into safe mode and delete the Dantz folder alltogether. Then boot normally and remove the programs through the Control Pannel."
2,"Forget the software, it's just an external drive","All-in-all: laughable. Installation was a nightmare, and there is poor support available via Maxtor's site.Once installed, the Maxtor software will recognize the drive maybe one out of every five attempts, making drive management and the handy One Touch feature impossible / useless via Maxtor software.Dantz software has a good reputation, but it works poorly with this drive. After performing a number of backups, I decided to test the restore capability. The softwware tells me how many restore points I have, but when I try to select a restore point, they all disappear. So I can backup, but I can't restore.Which means that this drive is useless for what it is intended, BUT it functions great as just a plain ol' external storgae device. Forget One Touch, forget Dantz, and do it the old fashioned way. I give it two stars because it's snappy and (so far) reliable."
1,total crap,"this has been a nightmare from the beginning. i got my second one after the first one needed to be replaced, and it doesn't work correctly either. they gave me a refurbished one. customer service is snooty and patronizing, and totally unhelpful and incompotent. they are refusing a refund, and it has been nothing but hassles and troubles and crap software to boot. i will never buy anything again from this company. and the biggest pain is that i still do not have anything backed up after all this trouble. maxtor sucks."
1,Highly not recommended,"I would highly discourage you from purchasing this product for what is advertised for: ""One touch"" backup. The backup software and drivers do not work well at all. Backup software is very limited and UI is NOT user friendly at all. Also, you will run into backup problems if you have long file path names. I am currently re-installing all of the software since it stopped working."
3,Data Loss Issues,"When the device runs it runs well.However, and I am not lying as suggested, I have lost data 4 times.It happended 3 times on a previous Maxtor I got from Costco, which I returned, and I got another and it just happended again.This is in a 12 month time period.It loses the partition, which needs to be re-created and reformated.After that it seem sas nothing happened. So I believe that data loss issues are real.It has been suggested by some that these devices should not be left on due to heat build-up. I am not sure if that is the issue.I am reasonably computer literate, being a computer consultant."
3,It's ok,"I purchased this item after reading about it in an article on the internet. My hair is very fine and highlighted and was in so-so condition. I didn't realize that it was pretty much just like vaseline in a jar! If used too much, your hair will become seperated and greasy looking. It's ok for the price."
1,Is death like this?,"A literally ""terrible"" Requiem. Listening to this music, I feel as if a dark black sticky cloud that I cannot shake off has enveloped me. If this was Silvestrov's intention, then this piece of work is successful. While I did appreciate and enjoy other pieces of Silvestrov's music, this one disappointed me."
5,A classic,The Seventies output of Herbie Hancock is right up there toe-to -toe with anything Miles did in the same period. The fact that Herbie is still around released records prolifically we might take him for granted. The four albums with Columbia in the Mid-70s are just monsters in funk and just sound better with age.
4,"great price, good deal","My kids really like City of Ember and Nim's Island. Both are acted well and appropriate for elementary and middle age school kids. Eragon was not done well, and the book is excellent. Die hard fans will be mad it is different than the book and non-readers will find the plot confusing.So buy this set, knowing that 2/3 are good, and for the price of the set, you are getting a steal."
3,"Not horrible, but not so great either","I was really excited about this toaster oven because of its looks and so many features (mainly the convection oven). I received one and the lights didn't work on the button panal, and Oster sent me a replacement - NO PROBLEM. I was very impressed with their customer service. Then, the second had a similar problem, but I didn't want to send it back AGAIN, so I kept it. The clock doesn't keep the right time, the buttons are very cheap, and ALL of my bread comes out soggy. I cook my potatoes with the convection feature, but it really takes just as long as my normal oven. My old toaster oven turned out the best bread, but I have never been able to do that with this oven; not with the broil feature, toast or regular oven. All-in-all, I kind of miss my cheap one, that was a LOT smaller (and cheaper). This model is OK, but I definitely don't feel that it lived up to the hype."
1,BEWARE: Product stopped working in less than two years!,"After much research, I purchased this product in late July, 2007. We used it for making toast, garlic bread, cooking fish, and reheating pizza. It was easy to operate (digital controls), the appliance was pleasing to the eye, and most importantly, it worked extremely well. Unfortunely, a few days ago, while my wife was cooking salmon, it just stopped working. It appears that I am not the only person that this has happened to. See the review entitled: BEWARE! HAD TO REPLACE TOASTER TWICE!, May 16, 2007 By Amber (Monson MA). I quess I should have heeded her advise. Since the warranty is only good for a year, it looks like I'm out of luck. I will send an email to Oster and see ""how"" they respond. I don't mind spending money on a product but I expect it to last more than 19 months. Too bad, it was good while it worked!!!"
2,"Good Oven, Bad Controls","This oven does a good job cooking food. It has a fan which allows it to be used as a convection oven and cook the food faster. There is a pan that is easy to clean.The controls are awful. The labels for the controls are beneath them, leading you to push the wrong buttons. The up and down buttons should be swapped. I'm not sure who designed this, but it's a pain to use. You need to scroll down to the oven selection you want (making sure to push the right buttons), then change the settings for that selection (again making sure to push the right buttons), then you can cook. What would have been nice (and they do this with their toaster) is to have a button for bake, a button for broil, a button for convection bake, a button for toast, etc. Then have buttons or a dial to change temp, time, etc. This has to be one of the worst interfaces I have ever seen while their toaster has one of the best. What's up Oster?"
4,Almost Perfect,"This 6 slice toaster, convection oven and broiler is almost perfect. The one feature I dislike is the inability to permanently change a toast color. Since my family likes toast brown, I use # 5 instead of the set #4 for toasting. Every time I toast, I must make this change. It is annoying."
4,the new Vonnegut!,"That's what Salon called this book and I for one agree with them. People expecting the easy-to-swallow humor of THE BASIC EIGHT might be scared off by this bok, but if you're up for a strange and imaginative trip, pick this up!"
3,Fun but/and dirty,"(Joseph Heller + Vonnegut + Tom Robbins) - Profundity - Perversion = this book. I love the opera setting of the book. It is humorous and not overdone. There's a golem, incest, a Rabbi Tsouris, oversexed college students, puberty, and shattering limbs -- so you probably won't be bored but you may be weirded out."
3,Lewd and Liscentious,"I'm a huge fan of Handler's other books, but it seems like he is simply trying to prove to the world that he isn't a children's author (and lord knows WHY anyone ever thought BASIC EIGHT was for children). I couldn't get past all the VERY GRAPHIC sex."
3,Watch Your Mouth - Daniel Handler,"""Watch Your Mouth"" is an operatic comedy about incest! So if you like weird books, this is right up your alley. I almost found it too weird, too strange, too absurd though. But you know what, I kept reading it. It was disturbing, but not disturbing enough to make me want to give up.I thought it was confusing with all of the opera tie-in's/references, but I'm not a big fan of opera. Also, the ending was weak and rather predictable.Character development was good though - I have an idea of what each character is like in my head. Despite it being rather short, it's not exactly a fast read - Handler is a little too wordy for me at times.Actually, I didn't really enjoy it at all, but I definitely won't forget it. And despite not really liking it, I'm somewhat tempted to read more by Handler just to see what else he can think of!"
5,"Terrific, and terrifically underrated","This is a dark and elegant book, the only novel I can think of that's explicit and oblique at the same time. The plot is a pageturner that keeps its air of mystery straight up to the hilariously creepy finale. It's stupid that so many critics (both on this site and off) criticize the subject matter and the tone of the book without realizing that it's the narrator whose world view is skewed and unrelentingly sexual, not the author. I dare anyone to read this book and not find themselves thinking about it, still trying to unravel it, weeks later, unlike most praised novels which lead you to their own conclusion. For Calvino and Henry Green fans, and anyone who finds poetry in old monster movies."
2,it has no on ans off switch,I was very surprised that this unit had on power switch. It can only be turned on and off by unplugging it.
2,"not worth owning, let alone paying money for","I wanted an alternative to using a spray water bottle for getting out minor wrinkles in clothes, and I figured this steamer might do the trick. It does create steam, and seems to be working properly, but it wasn't enough to actually get any wrinkles out... unless you want to stand there steaming until you've actually drenched the item.Squirt bottle that does the trick - $1Steamer that is only taking up space in my house - $25Your choice."
4,Like Magic!,"This is such a great product! I travel a lot and hate lugging out an ironing board, waiting for the iron to heat up and spending 20 minutes trying to get my clothes ironed. This takes just 2 minutes to heat up and is very easy to use. It's great for upholstery and delicate pieces that cannot be ironed too I wish it had a retractable cord and this would be perfect. Make sure not to tilt it too far over or you will have a mess"
3,It serves the purpose,Small and portable. Perfect for travelling. But too bad doesn't have international voltage / wattage preference. International users may not be able to use this item without converter / transformer.
1,Does not work,"I purchased this because of the good reviews I saw on Amazon. I found that it was larger than I anticipated, thus not suitable for traveling and it did not remove any wrinkles. The water boiled quickly and steam was produced, but all wrinkles remained."
4,Fast and easy,"This is my second garment steamer and it has features which make easier to start and use. Besr used with distilled water, i.e. no hassle with adding salt.I use it on shirts returned from our in house laundry...meaning many wrinkles. End result, not perfect, but presentable. I do at least 2 shirts per load and I turn it off, while I turn the shirt over.Yes, I recommend it, especially the quick response by Amazon."
2,Alright... for a short time,"I bought one of these a couple years ago and it worked fine for a little while. the water containers not th ebest design and it started sputtering right off the bat. It's definitely not something that you would be able to use at many angles.. again because the water container only holds the water in a certain position, you would only be abl eto hold it very upright in order to steam anything.Mine also started leaking out the base. I don't know when it happened, but at first I attributed it to all the sputtering that was coming out of the spout.After a year or so it just stopped working. the light would turn on, but nothing would heat up. It wasn't until then that I actually realized that water was leaking through the base (because there's no way it could be the sputter if theres no steam coming out right?)It's a cheap quick fix, but definitely not something I would buy again."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this item in early July, and loved it when I first used it. Unfortunately, after only about 3 times, I started to feel steam burning my hand as I held it, and all the water leaked out from the join under the handle. It seems to be leaking from the other side too. Since it's too late to return it, I'm now reduced to either trying to find a suitable glue to seal the openings, or throwing it out. It's too bad the reservoir wasn't better made. Maybe I just got a lemon........"
5,"Can't wait to use it more for clothes and craft projects, sewing","Don't do what I did the first time, though - I used it on my dress I was wearing. This is a powerful steamer. It gets very hot. Works like a dream but can burn like a dream if you don't use it right."
3,efficient but not always effective,"Compact, boils quickly, but you do have to hold it very close to the fabric. It works well on silks and polyester but it's not great for pressing shirts and whatnot. if you're looking for a quick fix, this is your go-to."
2,Not satisfied,"The Steamfast does get really hot, but not hot enough to steam out wrinkles in dress slacks. I wanted it to steam out and refresh my husbands dress slacks in between visits to the cleaners. Unfortunately it just didn't work. I tried slow and right on the fabric. I even tried to with the pants inside out. Didn't work. I was happy I was able to return it. Still searching!"
3,Not bad for the price,"This steamer is not as good as I hoped it would be but for the money it is decent. I had to hold it quite close for it to get sufficient steam near the fabric and it did not drop the wrinkles as well as I would have liked. I did not have any incidents of ""spitting"". I actually purchased this product to steam Gum Paste Flowers and Fondant and it works fine for that. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs it for light wrinkles. If you expect professional result you should purchase a professional clothes steamer."
5,SteamFast SF-435W Compact Fabric Steamer..Awesome,"This steamer works wonders! I filled up to line as I am one to follow directions, took like a minute to heat up and in no time was I ironing out store made wrinkles. You know, the ones that when they are shipped to store in boxes then put on display with wrinkles still in and you bring home, only to find you cannot iron them out alone? Well with the Steamer, they came out!! I also have a very nice black jacket that gets a touch wrinkly bust mostly finds all the cat hair in my house, so I took the Steamer, along with the lint remover attachment, and got all the cat hair off and wrinkle free. Very impressed with this buy, as well as it is work the money!!!"
3,"Ok steamer, good size for travel","I bought this steamer to bring on trips where fancy dress is required. It is small enough to fit neatly in a suitcase, however the small size makes it difficult to steam for very long before needing to refill it. Takes a fairly long time to steam a full suit or an entire dress, but it does get the job done. I would recommend this if you need something small for traveling."
1,Sent it back,"This was thin, light and cheap. But it was also big, too large to travel with. So I bought the Steamfast stand-up version and it works much better."
3,"Not bad, does the job, but leaks","It'll get a wrinkle out, but it will also spit all over your garment. Which isn't horrible but still inconvenient if you need to get out the door right away."
2,Fabric Steamer,"Not impressed with this steamer. I returned it thinking it was defective in some way. All it did every time I used it was spurt out hot water and soaked my clothes, instead of hot steam and steaming my clothes. Also, there wasn't a button to control how much steam came out."
3,"Ok for removing light wrinkles quickly, but it is no replacement for a real Iron.","I use this primarily for daily use of my dress shirts. Compared to having to pull out an ironing board it is faster, but not by much. I like it so I don't have to pull out the ironing board. There's definitely a technique you need to learn to use this so that your shirts look decent. However, if you have bad wrinkles or need to look really crisp it cannot replace a good old fashioned iron. It might be because this is not a really heavy duty steamer, but if you're looking for something to quickly remove wrinkles within a few minutes in the morning without the hassle of an ironing board. This will work fine."
2,Pretty crappy,"It does worka bit, but unless you havce a lot of free time to lose, or you find using this relaxing, this is not worth it at all. It takes too much time to do a shirt and you have to refill it for every shirt. I rather work an extra couple of hours and just send my shirts to the cleaners. Weak product.overall, I say it's better to just use an iron or cleaners, definitely dont get this!"
1,Didn't work as advertised,We returned this excuse for a steamer - didn't do the job. Back to using the old iron and board!
5,Amazing!,"What an incredible tool! Easy, fast and effective.Perfect for knitted fabrics and almost perfect for woven ones. And it makes life so much easier.I almost trashed my iron after buying it! ;-)"
4,Like it,"This is perfect to use sometimes,This is not to use daily.The cordless is short.Is fast and compact"
2,Spits water - a lot of water,"1st use was great, second and there after - it spits a lot of water... I want to return it."
2,No shut off,"The steamer works well, but there is no on/off button nor is there an automatic shut off.I left the steamer on with a little water left, hoping to just steam a tie, and went to check on something. The water quickly evaporated and the steamer kept burning, so the steamer started burning the plastic and melting. The whole room smelled of burning plastic and the steamer can no longer hold water. Be careful and always keep an eye on the product."
4,Beats the heck out of ironing.,"I don't really own a lot of shirts that require a nice press, and I don't always hang things up in a timely enough manner for them to not be slightly wrinkled. This steamer does a good job at knocking out wrinkles without having to throw things back in the dryer just to beat them up a little more."
4,Steam but dont look,"read this first:[....]i got it, it works great.no off on button is a good thing- forces you to unplug from the wall.lasts for 2-5 shirts depending on how heavy are the wrinkles and how much area you need to steam.i like the blue light.the water thats left inside tends to become whitish - CLEAN IT !!!if you dont you will end up splattering calcified deposit on your garments and ruin them.thats the only downer, when the water is low it splutters, if theres white water inside it will be bad for your stuff!read about steam:[...]"
1,Don't waste your money.,I plugged it in and got through 1 shirt before it shut itself off and never worked again. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,fair at best.,This steamer is only fair at best. Runs out of water very quickly. The only reason I didn't return it was because it is too much trouble getting it shipped back. I should have spent the extra money for a better one. I received it in a timely manner in the timeline it was promised. I would not make this purchase again. If it were a local purchase I would return it in a minute! The 3-star rating is for the service not the product.
4,great! it works as expected,Does a good job for getting out wrinkles. Fits nicely in the luggage while traveling. Problem is no shut off button. Another thing is it spitts out water when filled to the max line
4,Great Little Steamer,"Great product:Pros:1. Compact: fits nicely in luggage.2. Works fast: less than 2 mins to start steaming.3. Good length of the electrical cord.Cons:1. Not Off switch, to turn off, you have to unplug it.Conclusion:If you're on the go, or do more damage ironing... this gadget is a life saver!"
3,Handy hand steamer,"This steamer is compact and easy to use. The steam could probably be ""hotter"" - sometimes I have trouble with stubborn wrinkles in very thick material. But it heats up fast and is lightweight so I can easily use it with one hand and smooth fabric with the other. The cap seems a little cheap - you have to place it on ""just so"" to line up with the threads and securely close it. The tank is small and if you overfill it will ""spit"" hot water so you've just got to be patient and take breaks to let it cool down, so you can refill periodically. If you are a person that steams a LOT of clothing in big batches or tends to do it ""just in time"" and want to do it quickly- this might not be for you."
4,handy little steamer,This steamer worked great on drapes I had recently hung that had creases in them. Brought it to my daughters new apartment so she could get wrinkles out of her new curtains and she liked it so much that she kept it to use for her clothing as well. It holds a decent amount of water and the cord is nice and long. We didn't have any trouble at all with water dripping or spitting.
2,Cheaply made,"Works pretty well. However, after a few months it started leaking water out of the bottom. It's cheaply made, I would not buy it again."
1,Oh Oh Oh,This steamer was bought based on others reviews. It does not take out the wrinkles from the clothes even though they were ironed before riding in the suitcase. The steam does not come out with much umph! I would not recommend this for the business traveler who needs to be presentable and will rely on this product to have their clothes looking okay.
2,so so,"I had to return this little steamer. It didn't really worked on my clothes' wrinkles, just warned them a little. It sprayed hot water everywhere and didn't do the job."
5,Excellent product,"This is a very handy product. I often decorate venues for weddings and most times we carry our chair covers lay flat to ensure some smoothness, but not that i have this steamer, thats one less thing to worry about. Steammed covers on the spot!!"
3,BBL's Review,"I was very disappointed. I probably should send it back, but I'm just going to give it away to a recent flood victim. It didn't work well unless the garment had a hard surface behind it. I can get the same affect with the travel steam iron which I carry and is half the size."
2,Doesn't last,I like small handheld steamers but they never seem to last. This one was no different. It started to leak water out the sides after a couple of months and then it kept tripping my outlet breaker which scared us so we tossed it. Definitely does not seem like it is built to last.
3,Works fine . . . one shirt at a time,"The items has a long cord and a compfortable handle and easy to pour in the resovoir hole (use distlled water so it does not collect deposits over time); it also does the intended job of steaming fabrics so it gets the wrinkles / creases, etc out.Only one annoyance is that the resovoir only hold so much water and it appears that one fill up is good for steaming one shirt. Other than that, it works as intended."
4,Very Happy,"This steamer works great on every day clothes materials. It works for about 12 minutes and get wrinkles out very quickly. It take very little time to heat up. Using distilled water works much better. Only downside was I tried to use it on thick material curtains, didn't work so well. Overall I am very pleased, great purchase!"
4,Awesom!,"Had been wanting a steamer for a while, looked at the expensive professional ones, but decided to buy this one because I needed something to unwrinkle my clothes (as I HATE ironing!) I absolutely LOVE this steamer. Its small and compact, didn't need to find somewhere to store it, as it is small enough to fit under my bathroom counter. It straightens my clothes so quickly, even removes almost ALL of the cat fur from them (I have 3 Persian cats)"
4,"If you hate ironing like me, buy this!",This works great for all my clothes especially in my hurried mornings before work when my outfit needs to be spruced up and well steamed. Starts up fast and gives steady stream of steam. Only wish it had an on/off button but just forces me to make sure not to leave it plugged in. Great little steamer!
4,Works as Promissed,"Heats up pretty quickly, and takes the wrinkles out in the morning when I'm getting ready for work. Glad I bought it."
1,Unusable piece of junk,"We used distilled water, we only partially filled the tank and the thing still just sputtered and spat water. Waste of $$."
3,Steamer,"While the operation is very easy and it does heat up very quickly, it did not do a very good job of removing wrinkles from gown."
1,Look it's a fountain!!!,"Terribly disappointed with this product. I used it acceptably for about 5 minutes. After that this thing just kept spewing water like it's a fountain. And YES, the water line is below the MAX line! Yet another product here at amazon that makes me wonder who writes these really high reviews. I think it's a bunch of guys from the maker of this steamer flooding amazon with great reviews to increase visibility for their product. This is a massive fail product. Unless of course you are looking for something to spray your garden with or something."
1,Not Happy.,"I bought two of these for use (a) prepping my daughter's wedding veil before the ceremony and (b) steaming out wrinkles for fabric used in the reception. It did nothing. Nothing. Given a choice between this product and a steamy bathroom... believe me when I say, you are truly far better off with the steamy bathroom. I've purchased many things on Amazon over the years that I absolutely love. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I even read the reviews prior to selecting these; some people love this item. I found it useless and I have used steamers with no problem before."
3,an OK steamer,It is light weight and easy to use. But not good to remove wrinkles on cotton fabrics. It takes forever to steam a cotton dress with wrinkles very disappointed.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I thought this little steamer would be perfect for removing wrinkles before I leave the house for work. It worked great the first time that I used it, but that was it. Since then it spurts water over the clothing, leaving large wet spots-what a mess! It is also dangerous, because the steaming water spurts onto exposed skin as well. I am careful not to fill the reservoir above the fill line. I have gone back to using a wet towel and hairdryer to freshen clothing before I leave the house."
3,Good but Not Great,"I tried this steamer on a rayon shirt and it worked, but that's expected considering rayon's thin. I tried steaming a cotton skirt and it didn't really work that well. I would say that it got rid of about 40% of the wrinkles. But, the pro is that the steamer steams up fast and the size is just right, not big and klunky and awkward to use."
3,average,"works, but not fantastic for clothing and it will take longer than simple ironing. other reviewers have noted you shouldn't expect it to get wrinkles out of clothes...of course you should, it says ""Removes wrinkles and odors from clothes, linens, curtains, upholstery, and more."" Clothes listed right there #1 in the description..."
1,This would work better as an electric tea kettle,"Received this today and am sorely disappointed. Tried it out on several shirts, most of them being of the "" easy iron"" variety with dismal results. Followed the directions and all the shirts look rumpled and anything but wrinkle free. I'm presuming all the positive reviews for this p.o.s are "" bought"" reviews. This is trash, do not waste your money! Returning ASAP."
2,Loved it while it lasted,"I thought this little steamer was good. It was small, but it got the job done... for a few months. It almost lasted a year before it just stopped working. I didn't expect much from a 20 something dollar steamer, but I thought it should last at least two years!"
4,Awesome little steamer!,"I needed a steamer for my yarn work (knitting and crochet). I read the reviews here, and didn't see anyone who also purchased it for this type of work, so I took the risk. I am so glad I did! It heats up incredibly fast, I never had a problem with it spitting at all and it's really easy to maneuver around. There are only two reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. One, because it really should have an on/off switch and doesn't (I had to keep unplugging it between pinning work so I wouldn't run out of water). Two, it needs a larger reservoir, and perhaps even a removable one. It would make cleaning and whatnot much easier. Other than that, totally worth the price! And, as a bonus, it's small, so it's not in the way when I'm not using it!"
2,Leaks terribly after a few months,"We've had this steamer now for about 6 or 8 months, and it was good enough at first, and we liked the design.Not having an on/off switch was a bit strange, and the cord has shown itself to be too short. But the worst by far, and the reason we are throwing it out and replacing it with a different model, is that the unit leaks water continuously whether unplugged or not. We have managed to ruin a few pieces of furniture, at first we thought perhaps we weren't being careful putting the unit down, or had forgotten to unplug it. Alas, not true. As others have reported, this steamer just starts leaking at some point, and never stops after that.Too bad, because the design seems ergonomic and practical, and it is nice to hold and use. But not if it's dripping water all over everything!"
2,maybe for travel,"This got two stars because it does actually produce steam. Unless it is held perfectly straight up and down, won't operate properly. Spits water. It does have a nice design, but for everyday use in place of an iron, forget it. Better for travel when having to touch up folded clothes. Unfortunatley, I don't travel anymore. I almost returned it, but thought I would wait for an opportunity for clothing. I had gotten this for newly hung draperies which I had to take down and conventionally iron anyways. Good yard sale item. Maybe I can give it to one of my boys. I don't do that much ironing anyways."
5,great for small projects,"Worked well on small wrinkles, heats up very quickly, great product for the price. I used it to remove small wrinkles from my wedding dress."
4,nice but smaller than i thougt and works only on 110 v,arrive before estamated time and in good packing but smaller than what we thougt but that's good for traveling and work's only by 110 volts
2,Limited Lifespan,"I had my steamer for about a year, only using it a few times during the year and the most recent time I discovered that it was leaking. There are little plastic feet on the bottom and somehow water was able to get out of the steamer through one of these plastic feet. I don't feel safe using a steamer that is plugged into the wall while leading water all over my counter. Worked fine until it didn't."
1,dissatisfied,"Tested and not approved! Product very weak, heats water but does not stretch any clothes. Tested in various tissues and none of them was good. You spend a lot of time and do not have any result. Unfortunately I will continue with the iron-to-pass."
2,Very Disappointed....,"Doesn't work as it was advertised, or as described; I would send it back, but I am in Afghanistan at this time. The laundry service does the best they can, but I still get things back very wrinkled, and was in hopes this item would help me with this problem."
2,Disappointed,"I was really excited at the thought of easily and quickly being able to release wrinkles from my clothes with this steamer. It heats up quickly and makes a lot of steam, but struggles to release wrinkles in fabrics that are any heavier than a very light cotton. It worked semi well on a summer blouse I tried it on, but with the lightweight sweater that I used it on, I didn't really notice any improvement. When using it, you have to be very careful or you will end up steaming new wrinkles into your garment. It also seemed to piddle and drip water quite a bit. For as long as it took to use this to steam clothing into a somewhat acceptable and wearable-in-public condition, I could have done a much better job with a standard iron, probably in less time. This product did not meet my expectations and will be going back.Pros: Heats up quickly, seems to make a lot of steam.Cons: Steam isn't effective on fabrics heavier than light cotton, unit piddles and drips, end up steaming in new wrinkles."
4,Handy,"I bought this for a special event so that we could steam clothes and not have to iron them. It works really well and the water heats up super fast. Just be careful operating as the steam will be VERY hot. The only downside was that I wish I could've used it horizontally too (without boiling water spilling out), but I knew that I couldn't before I bought it. Very pleased with the purchase though."
4,It works!,"Great little steamer and it really works. Easy to hold. Have to fill it frequently tho, one fill did only four tee shirts. I will never iron again."
2,Spend more money...,"I read reviews and thought I'd made a good choice with the SteamFast...I wish I would have spent a little more money and gotten a better, heavy-duty steamer. This steamer doesn't get the job done. We've used it one time and re-boxed it...a wet wash cloth in the dryer does a better job. Disappointed..."
1,Java & BAPI Technology for SAP,"I wish the authors put more content on the interaction of Java and BAPI, with more example codes on how to use Java to call BAPI etc. It would be perfect if they could use some real-world sample codes or lead their readers go through some complete exercise. Instead, the authors put lots of unnecessary information there, which we can find more in detail from other sources. We do not get what we really want from this book. I am surprised this book even got published."
1,Waste of money,"One of the junk books I;ve read lately. Poor content, structure and presentation. Lots of pages but no information. The authors/publishers tried very hard to increase the book size with all sorts of tricks. About thirty pages of the book are either blank or have chapter titles but no useful info. Not many useful code samples. The chapters on Java, OOP etc are really not necessary as there are lot of excellent tutorials/free books available on the internet. Very little information on the actual Java&BAPI as the title suggests. I;ve noticed a couple of errors in the Java related chapters. I will be very surprised if rest of the book is error free. Please do not waste your money by buying this POS."
5,want baby skin?,"I whole heartedly agree with the above review so no need to repeat. I use this along with the bath oil wash and let me tell you, my skin is just as it was when I was a kid. My skin feels heavenly- smooth, soft, supple and never dry."
5,Love it!,This lotion is wonderful! It smells good and feels good going on. It even makes itchiness go away! It's great to use especially when your skin is irritated.
5,AMAZING!,"This lotion is incredibly light yet nourishes my skin unlike anything I've ever tried (and I've tried a lot!) It's non-greasy, absorbs instantly & has a clean, fresh scent. I use & recommed all of Sebamed's products!"
1,For Sensitive Skin??? Not mine.,"I have very sensitive skin which includes perfume. This has perfume, although in the german spelling of parfum. It is too much for my skin, I need fragrance free. So I had to send all of the items of sebamed that I ordered. I did find a great alternative that is fragrance free which is the Earth Science Clarifying face wash, and their fragrance free moisturizer, and their Apricot Nite cream. Amazon does carry these, but the Earth Science website gives you free shipping on orders of $25 or more."
1,Juiceman not for wheatgrass.,This juicer will not last if you want to juice wheatgrass. I burned up 3 juicers before switching to a different one.
5,great for group shots,"Quantum products for the serios photographer is first rate, when carrying alot of equipment is not an option for your shoot...."
4,The OUTBACK into JAZZ !,"Although it deserves 5 stars ,I have a little personal reservation for the special sounds and effects in between the musical parts.It is interesting;the introduction of the DIJIRIDOO the Australian Aboriginee instrument with a deep buzzing spooky sound which Nick Demopoulos plays very well apart from his enchanting guitar playing.I have 2 CDs by Nick:The first: HARMONIC CONVERGENCE is excellent jazz,pure and masterful,definitely 5 stars!EXEGESIS(from the Greek meaning EXPLANATION) is also great music-if you do go for special sound effects you will love it!-Due to my age I personally passed the special effects stage!I only want pure music,that is...the beef! ! It looks like this young talent MR.Demopoulos with his very capable different crews on each CD is on a firm way to stardom.I do recommend both CDs to the jazz fans,for the experience of a fresh soul !"
5,What a good book!,I bought this for my girls to read for a literature group for our home school. Both they and I really enjoyed it!
5,Quality Ottoman,"The ottoman came quickly in perfect shape. The color matched my leather chair perfectly and the accent stitching also matched that on the chair. The size is great because it doesn't take up too much of our small living room while also giving a little extra storage space for afgans, pillows etc. This is a quality piece of furniture for a great price."
1,Disappointed,I was super excited to receive my ottomons. I got them today and I am extremely disappointed. One of them is broken--and not from shipping. The hinge is broken and I can't believe a company would ship an item that is so obviously broken. All they had to do was open the ottomon ONCE to see it was defected. It just shows they do not check their stuff before shipping. VERY disappointed--sending back.
5,"Great, well-made LEATHER storage ottoman","Great, well-made leather storage ottoman. They measure 18""W x 18""L x 16""H. A perfect size to slide underneath my sofa table for extra seating. I am extremely happy with the quality. They are safety hinged to prevent the tops from slamming down. They arrived perfectly and were packaged very well. No regrets with this purchase whatsoever!"
5,great product,"Purchased when Amazon had a promotional price, and thought it worked great. Light weight so I can move it, and good leather."
2,OK for a last ditch backup device,I planned to use this drive as additional network storage but it has two flaws that are showstoppers for me.The first is that because it uses linux as it's operating system it makes the modification date and the creation date the same. So you lose the original creation date whenever you copy a file to the drive.The second is an annoyance. Whenever you lose power and then power is restored the drive remains off. You have to manual push the power button on the front of the device. I often use my computer remotely and have been unable to access the drive when on the road until I can get back and push the power button.
5,A Wonderful Book,"Cold Nights and Hot Biscuits is a wonderful book that will be a precious walk down Memory Lane for some and a peek into the past for others. From the insightful poetry, to the heartwarming recollections of a simpler time and place, this book will be an addition to your library that you will want to read again and again. You will not be disappointed by the time you spend with this delightful book."
3,Honing the compelling catch,"Sophomore from the unlucky noise-poppers would become something of an indie rock cult fave is full of almost-there's, a couple of shouldn't haves, and a few why not more's?"
3,SAHB smokin'!,"I always hold my breath when ordering these type of releases. By that I mean the old recordings dug out of the vault many years passed. This is a very nice surprise indeed! Sound quality is very good and the band is smoking. A very good ""Hot City Symphony"" live. I've been waiting for that since I saw SAHB perform it on Rock Concert many years ago. Nice addition to the catalog."
3,Robert Hooke Biography,"I found this review of the life of Robert Hooke to be quite fascinating. His breadth of interest and commitment to science was far greater than that of anybody else in that period. He laid out the pattern for our modern understanding of the universe. Interestingly, most scientists have never heard of him, or are only aware of his work in passing. The book is an eye-opener."
3,SLOW - SLOW - SLOW,"I'm a huge William Petersen fan so when I found this item I snapped it up. (Be careful - this film has 2 other titles: Curacao and Deadly Currents.) Despite the fact that it has some decent actors involved, this movie just never gets off the ground. It's so slow it creeps along with an overacting George C. Scott and Dennis Christopher. The action is minimal but, for those who are interested, there are 2 brief nude scenes of Mr. Petersen that are worthwhile. Other than that, I it's an okay film but nothing more."
3,It's an okay flick.,"It's not really bad, nor is it great. It was entertaining enough that I didn't quite watching it after 30 minutes."
1,On the boring side...,I was disappointed in William Peterson's performance. As for George C. Scott...was he getting desperate for movie scripts at the end of his life? Definitely a low budget movie.
5,"Hilarious, hilarious, hilarious","Hilarious, hilarious, hilarious. I love Christian but Samia Shoaib steals the show as the Indian chick who went to Eton and plans the murder of an older man who is pimping out his retarded nephew. That she sometimes gets kidnapped by organized crime families the way other people spend a week in Orlando is so hilarious. She's all about fixing others and improving others. She is so hilarious. And there's just enough of her..."
2,Nothing new,"I was disappointed cause it said there was two news episodes, when I got it I realized I watched the second last one already in the current series and the last one in teh current series as well, what was the point in buying this when I have all box sets and pre-ordered the current one. Waste of money nothing new."
4,Psych as good as ever but I expected more.,"About a year ago I thought about this idea, I wanted to compile Psych episodes for a Halloween themed DVD. why? because Psych has the material. Hence, I was very excited about this release. But you don't care about that.The truth is, the episode selection is good but it came out a little short. Being a fan of the show I can't help but feel that it lacks of a few ""scary"" episodes like ""Scary Sherry: Bianca's Toast"" from season one or ""Ghosts"" from season three (the last one would have been a good addition since ""Shawn (and Gus) of the Dead"" was included).It was great that it had two episodes never before seen on DVD but with the season 6 DVD coming out in a few weeks, is it worth it? I guess it is if you are a hardcore fan and you want this in your collection, if you're not, I guess you can skip it and do something better with those 10 to 12 bucks."
1,OK,Not worth the money if you already own oter seasons. I thought it would be new ones but 2 were from older season and 2 were from season 6.
5,Love,Anything Psych is worth the money! I own every season and it was fun to get another disc with a few things I had never seem before.
4,a wild ride through south america,i thought the story was daring and racy. any woman brave enough to trek through the jungles of south america and have sexual adventures while doing it should be a dream vacation for any woman with the gumption to do it. a very entertaining read.
2,disappointed,As a follower of Sandra Hill I must say I was disappointed with this book. It lacked both her usually very funny dialog but also the plot just did not excite. If your looking for a good read try her other books this one will have you skipping pages to finish it.
2,Sadly disappointed,"I have waited and waited for Tykir's story. He was such a great background player in The Outlaw Viking and in The Tarnished Lady. I expected a much better story for him than what was written. Personally, I was hoping he went forward in time. I didn't care for the heroine in the book either. Even though this is number four in a series, it is going to the second hand book store. One can only hope Adam's story will be better. Sandra Hill started out with a bang writing her first books, but has definitely went down hill since then."
3,Enjoyable,I love most of Sanda's books. I liked this one but I thought the humor was a little silly at times. The action was often inserted just to have an action scene even when it didn't really follow the plot. But I must say I did find the characters very compelling and it was refreshing to see a heroine with freckles. It was still a good read though and I will definitely pick up more of her stories. This just wasn't my favorite Sandra Hill book but I'm certain there will be more.
4,A LAUGH OUT LOUD ROMP!,"This was the first book I have read by this author and I loved it! My husband thought I was crazy as I laughed out loud at the main characters bickering between each other. The plot was a little ""convient"" but highly entertaining. I think I would like a viking of my own now! I would recommend this book to all my girlfriends!"
4,Funny and Sexy. A Great Read.,"This was my first Sandra Hill book. I was completely surprised by her humor and wit. I have to read more. Two thumbs up for this type of approach to the traditional ""Romance Novel""."
3,I like Sandra Hill but..............,"I have read all of Ms.Hill's books and enjoyed every one of them. This one wasn't what I would of expected from her. I had a hard time liking any of the characters, although there were a few spots in the story that made me laugh. The heroine in the story was constantly told how unattractive she was with her ""red hair,freckles and too skinny body"". The sad part was that I agreed with them. She wasn't even very likable.I know that Ms. Hill can do better and I will continue to buy her books.If you want a good read try her other books first."
3,Not as good as the others,"This was a disappointment after The Last Viking and The Outlaw Viking, which I found much more entertaining. Perhaps Sandra Hill needs the time travel element to do her best. And does anyone else find the cover repulsive, with that smirking, snotty-looking 20th century rock star on it? I almost didn't buy it for that alone."
3,Somewhat dissapointing,"I have read every single one of Sandra Hill's books and loved all of them. This is the first one I was dissapointed in. Technically it was good, but it just didn't have her usual flair. I am sorry to criticize one of my favorite authors, but there it is. I just hope that her next book will be better."
3,A Disappointment.,"I have read all of Ms. Hill's previous novels and enjoyed them immensely. I think that she was trying too hard to be funny in this book and as a result it was more like a sitcom than a historical romance. Ms. Hill has a wonderful natural flair for humor (which was evident in her previous novels)and she should just go with the style that she has used successfully in the past.Also,the heroine (Alinor ) came across as being rather annoying ( this is a trend that I have observed in other work by other authors lately). I gave it three stars because I did find it somewhat entertaining, but I hope that her next one will be better."
3,"Like the film, a CD that has it's merits.","So I Married An Axe Murderer, Mike Myers underrated follow-up to Wayne's World, was a film with some truly funny moments. Likewise, the soundrack does have it's charms. A collection of alternative songs, highlights include not one but two versions of THERE SHE GOES, SATURDAY NIGHT, MAYBE BABY, and TWO PRINCES. A decent compilation."
1,Not really into it,"Although I loved the movie, I can't say the same for the soundtrack. I don't really care for many of the songs on the album...they're very early nineties (if you're into that, more power to ya!). The only songs that I cared about were one of the versions of ""There She Goes"" which I think sounds better than Six Pence None The Richer's version (which I also like, by the way); the other is ""This Poem Sucks"": the song is jazzy and has Mike Meyers punchy voice and funny words. Yet, I'd much rather listen to his second poem, ""Ode to Rose,"" from the movie, which is a bit better...too bad they didn't put it on this album... See the movie first (because it's definitely worth seeing) and sample the music before you buy. A lot of the songs that I like from the movie (none of the wedding songs are included...who could forget Mike Meyers version of ""Do ya think I'm sexy""?) are not on this album."
4,Hang your ups and downs when you come to the sunshine.,"Like the title says, this is a collection of ""soft pop nuggets from the WEA vaults"". Most of the songs here are very obscure. The only real hit here was the title song by Harpers Bizarre. And Monkees fans will probably remember ""Someday Man"", although it wasn't a hit. The rest of the songs will probably be unfamiliar to almost everybody. But just because they weren't hits, doesn't mean they aren't good. On the contrary, most of the songs here are very good. There are a lot of sophisticated soft pop gems on this CD. Fans of groups like the Association and the Tokens should really enjoy it."
4,Loved it! She is now on my 'must buy' list.,"I stopped into our local Borders on my lunch break, started reading this, and was hooked right away. Bought the book and read it in one sitting. Love her writing style, it's very real, yet funny, with great descriptions and a way of telling the story that pulls you right in. It's the kind of book you just want to put the radio on, and curl up under a cozy blanket with.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of a coincidence at the end that was just ridiculous, and could have been handled in a far more believeable way. She redeemed herself though, and I can't wait to read more by this author."
3,Much better than average Brit Chick Lit,"My opinion of this book falls somewhere between reviewers dblynn and jbb/ny - I started, lost interest, skimmed the middle and started reading again halfway through, totally hooked until the end. Was it predictable? Well, yes. Does knowledge of Sex and the City, Bridget Jones and any other well-known romantic comedy of the last ten years or so help put it in context? Yes on that, too. However, I liked the point of view of the author and I thought she created real people who are less than perfect, who don't always say what would work for the plot but what real people actually say. Is it a romance book? Sort of, although it is more than that with much to discuss with friends afterwards.A good women's book club read."
2,Wrong Color,"Product arrived wrapped in plastic with a tag that read ""Clear Caulk"" but the product in the wrapping was actually a tube clearly marked ""Bright White"" I'm sure the product itself is great, but I needed and ordered CLEAR. I suppose I will keep it for something else, as I am not thrilled at the notion of wasting time trying to return something under $10.... Disappointed!!"
4,Ready to eat your words?,"Now that the market has crashed I hope everyone here who gave Tamara a negative review because she was being so pessimistic can see that she was just trying to warn us. The signs have always been there, bad policy, overconfidence, blaming the victim while inequality grew for everyone, it all eroded the America we thought we knew. Cassandra wasn't popular either, but she was right."
1,"Poor RoI on this book, cut your losses and read something else","I started to read this book and found it frustrating. The author seemed to believe that people can make poor life choices and should not have to deal with the consequences of their actions. I'm in my late 20s and yes times can be tight and student loans suck, but I made my choices and will deal with them. Based on the 1/3 of the book I read, potential readers are better off reading about how to manage their money, and not read about people whining about not having any. I can't remember who said it, but one of the best qoutes about money is ""It's not how much you make, but what you do with how much you make.""I would suggest reading ""The automatic Millionare"" for a good how-to book on finance that anyone can understand. Or, for a good philosophical prospective, yet easy read try ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad."" If you become a finance dork, like me, try the classic ""Intelligent Investor"" by Graham (it worked for Warren Buffet)."
2,"I know it's tough, but.....","I really enjoyed a lot of the statistics and examples that Draut used, but the whole book just drowns in the ""woe is me"" & ""It's not my fault"" feeling. She totally dismissed financially immature actions, such as the one gentleman who kept flying and adding to his credit card bill because he and his spouse thought keeping in touch with family was more important than being responsible, or the need to go to every Tom, Dick & Harry's wedding.Without a doubt, it is more expensive for young adults to get started on their own today, but I think Draut reached the wrong conclusions for the some of the facts she presented."
1,"Please, won't the government save me!",The author spends most of the book blaming outside influences. The only good part of the book is the statistics the author brings up that stimulate thought. Unfortunately she ignores anything that contradicts her stance rather than address the counter points to add validity to her argument.In the end this author wants the government to do the changing so she doesn't have to. She thinks we should raise taxes to give govrernment funded debt relief so young adults can fly to every wedding they are invited to.I would recomend this book to someone graduating highschool so they can learn the dangers of student loans. I would not recomend this book to anyone who feels we are responsible for our own choices and need to look out for ourselves and not be dependent on the government.
4,Intensified!,"A great selection of offerings for the Jamaican National Festival song competition. A few tracks sound a bit dated, but most are as fresh and energetic as they must have sounded in the early days of Jamaican independence. Standouts are cuts by the Maytals, Pioneers, U Roy, and Desmond Dekker. What a lighthearted genius to change the commercial slogan ""dirt can't hide from intensified Tide"" into ""girls can't hide from intensified vibes"". Fine addition to your party mixes!"
3,Not ideal for Senseo,"This purchase was a substitute for Senseo pods for use in a Senseo machine, but I will not repeat that mistake. Perhaps because Senseo pods have a definite top and bottom, they fit perfectly every time and produce a full layer of foam. And I prefer the non-chemical, barely-detectable flavor of Senseo pods. If, however, you like strong flavoring, and use another manufacturer's machine, these may very well be the pods for you."
5,Love it!,I love this conditioner and is very disappointed that Bath & Body Works discontinued it. It leaves even natural hair feeling soft and very managable.
3,Very convenient!,The fact that you can cut to fit...no room for mistake.I hate to order things that later you have to return.
4,Passed with Flying colors,"My son recieved this present as a gift. He has thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. We have only had it a short time, but so far so good."
2,Pain to construct,"The launcher is a pain to construct. Pushing the motors into place and then attaching the wheels is not possible by a child, even with supervision. It took a lot of effort and the holes had to be made bigger. Once the wheels are in place it is a little easier to connect the cables and get the launcher running. It is then good fun, but it is a shame the construction is so fiddly, it would have been a great project if the child could do most of it themselves."
1,Product does not perform,"The kit was very easy to build (others said it was difficult, but it seems like the manufacturer may have simplified it).It is not useful at all for the purpose we had in mind: a school science fair. My son wanted to have a way to consistently launch planes to compare their performance. This launcher will not launch a single plane in a way that meets the need. The motors are so weak that as soon as the plane begins to go through, the thing bogs down and stops. We have tried many designs, including the one suggested in the instructions. No success. I do not recommend this product."
2,Only works for little planes,The plane launcher only works for smaller planes and does not work for any planes containing quarters or for larger planes. Also note that you have to self assemble everything and need a small screw driver to put the whole thing together.
2,Lots of static,I bought this phone looking for an inexpensive cordless as I rarely use my landline. But I had to return it; there was way too much static despite trying a number of channels. I bought a GE 26928GE1 instead and have much clearer reception.
2,Rubbish!!!!,This was dribble! Thats all I can say! Loved Twelve but this was a poor effort in writing. I am sorry but for a second novel this is very much like a forced book as the editing is terrible also.
1,Just awful,"First off, I thought Twelve was a sensational novel and promised a great career for the author. But this? Not only was it not a novel, but it was barely even an idea. Poorly written, poorly paced and poorly edited. How did this get published??"
5,Best book I have read all year!,"I loved this novel! I read quite a bit and think this is the best book I have read in a long time. The symbolism is incredible but not so, ""in your face,"" that it is annoying. All of the different threads come together in a fascinating way at the end of the book. I could not recommend it more.Margaret Krause"
1,Less than a web page,"This book really only covers pull-down/pull-up in any depth, and that information is incorrect. It repeatedly refers to pulldown/pullup from film to video as being 1%, when it is actually .1%, a mistake by a factor of 10! That would make it hard to stay in sync! If you already know anything at all about film audio post, this book is too basic. If you don't, there are better sources, such as the Protools reference manual."
4,It gets right to the point,"I found this book to be very helpful. It has a lot of information in one place that Ive had only previously seen spread over three or four different books. It gets right to the point without any fluff. The tables that explain the different types of time code, how pull-downs work and the different types of digital audio alone make this worthwhile."
2,Digital Audio Post for Films on a Budget,"Mr Tone's book is informative, but not anything that cannot be found for nothing on the net for nothing. He is evidently well informed, possibly this is a prelude to something more substantial."
5,Really work,"This product really works. I use new packets in the eggs every three months. An opened box of salad mushrooms lasts for 5 days, grapes in aerated plastic containers last 7 days, sliced carrots in a bag last 14 days, spinach leaves in an opened bag last 7days. This system keeps me from needing to go to the grocery store every time fruits & vegetables spoil."
3,Barnes is quite biased,"Barnes likes highlighting all of the problems that arise in Aristotle's works. In addition, he highlights how impossible it is to get at Aristotle's philosophy at all since it comes down to us through mysterious sources. Of course that is fine, but for newcomers to Aristotle it seems that criticism should be placed aside to begin with so that we can understand basically what was claimed. I was particularly put off by the fact that he wrote three of the essays in this work himself and claims that Aristotle's work ""Metaphysics"" has nothing unifying it at all. This is not a majority position among Aristotle scholars, indeed it is a radical and extremely skeptical claim. For a more charitable view of Aristotle for newcomers I recommend Joe Sachs' prefaces to his translations of Aristotle."
4,Nice little book,"Nice little book...a compilation of different beaders work. Price was right, didn't see it in person, but glad I got it."
1,Mussolini the untold story,"I saw the original the day that was air many years ago,in this one is missing part 2 and part 3 of the mini series,that was excellent,as soon you have available the second and third parts let me know,pleaseThe Completed miniseries is excellent a superb acting by all the cast,and the story is real life of el Duce,it was a master piece of world war II history"
4,Mussolini The Untold Story,This was a premier miniseries when it first aired on TV. The disc I received was fine but only included Part One of a 3 part series----So was incomplete. Apparently Parts Two and Tree are hard to come by. The series has a fine cast with excellent photography.
3,band ring,"It is ok, not exactly like pictured. The diamonds sit deeper in the band than expected and are cloudy and do not shine like expected. The ring is nice for the price though."
2,Pretty and Dainty but not made very well,This is a very dainty ring. It was exactly what i was looking for. By the next day one of the diamonds were missing and by the end of the week three were missing.
2,Unexpected :-(,This was my 1st purchase from Amazon & it has shattered my expectations ...Coz it is very small compared what it looks like in its pic & you can't even see the diamonds in it :(
4,Great purchase!,"Overall this was a great purchase! The price was extremely low compared to all the other places I had looked, and I shopped around everywhere. Plus I got free shipping and the part was just as pictured, brand new in original packaging, it even came 4 days earlier than expected! The only thing I can complain about is that I expected it to come with the screws and bolts to attach it to the vehicle, but then again, nowhere in there ad did they say that would be included, so thats really just a bad assumption on my part... I would strongly recommend ordering from them and will definetly check with them in the future for any other parts i may need..."
4,Learning to face your fears...,"Twelve-year-old Janey Winston has a huge secret...she's afraid of the dark. Thanks to a horrifying childhood experience, Janey has slept with a nightlight throughout her life and has no plans to do without one anytime soon.Then Janey and her best friend Claudia find out their school's reading club, of which they are both members, is planning a co-ed sleepover in the school cafeteria. The two girls are thrilled, especially since they know that Blake and Malcolm, the two boys they secretly have crushes on, will also be attending.But Janey also knows that after the fun is over, everyone will settle down for the night...in the dark. She desperately wants to be with her friends, but she also knows she isn't going to get rid of a lifelong fear within a matter of weeks.Janey is so embarassed about having a ""babyish"" problem that she doesn't want anyone to know. But, as Janey learns, sometimes you have to trust others and let them help you in order to conquer your fears..."
3,I WANT TO LOVE IT........,"a long time TPHB fan, I've never been disappointed...until now....it makes me a little sad. Unlike just about everyone (I guess) I found the video of ""Pack Up The Plantation"" to be dreadfully lacking in the level of energy and consistency I've come to expect from TP & the HBs (mostly TP). Recorded or live, these guys have always blown me away. Live, they're truly unbelievable and the ""Live"" CD of this tour was clearly NOT drawn entirely from this film. In fact I was only positive that one of the songs on the film was actually on the album. Although all the songs were from the tour, most of the songs came from other performances (clearly) and the differences are startling (depending on the night). Frankly, Tom seemed a little ""less focused"" than usual on the video. I'm not sorry I have it (although the price was outrageous) but, thank God I have the compilation CD so I truly have the best of the best of that tour and, of course, memories of electrifying concerts."
2,A Mormon history book,"Although an interesting little book, it is primarily a Mormon history book written from a child's perspective with most documentation from Mormon sources. If you are looking for a book the covers a broader spectrum of material, this is not the book for you."
1,A Guru Wanna-Be,"After some research, I met the author of ""First Thunder"" and he clearly wrote the book to start his own group and compete with Transcendental Meditation, after they kicked him out.Any 20 minute meditation will do the same thing - please don't pay anyone [this much]for some ""sacred and ancient"" snakeoil.Get REAL enlightenment by reading ""Loving What Is"" by Byron Katie. She is the real deal. Some other really good books include ""I Am That"" by Nisargadatta, and ""Nothing"" by Jim Sloman.If you want to be a couch potato and enjoy altered states, go ahead and meditate 10 hours a day. But don't try to fool yourself that it makes you ""enlightened""."
3,It kind of grows on you,"It is hard to imagine all of what is described in this book actually taking place. I don't think it really matters. What does matter is it is a story, like the subtitle says, of discovery. We all have it within us to simply be perfect. Without want nor fret. I came to this book when my Dad was into them and sent me it and the Ascension title. I discovered its secrets ON MY OWN. You can too. Its right there. Right where you are."
1,Very dissappointing,I found the story line hard to follow at times. I am a seeker of truth and have been involved with metaphysics for over twenty years. This story may be up-lifting to some but no hands on information that will adance knowledge is available in this book. Book is a pro-mo to hand out cash to take a coarse that really dosen't tell you up front what you will be gitting into.
2,Think Carefully,"I suspect Ascending is essentially a reworking of old Buddhist techniques. I suspect the premises are very valid but remin disappointed and let down by the book. How would I know!? The book certainly doesn't give you anything concrete to go on. Come on! We aren't even worthy to know the first technique? I remain highly sceptical of anything where I have to go somewhere, find someone, pay something, and who knows what else. I would rather walk my own path."
1,Warning... If You Value Your Time and Money,"Granted, each person's spiritual path is uniquely honorable but no matter what your path, this book is a wasted detour. In order to get to any teaching that has even a suggestive hint of substance, you have to bear an amateur writing style that made me wonder how it possibly got by even a novice editor.As a lifetime student of world religions and spiritual evolution, I felt badly for the meditative practices that were so grossly mangled by this author's exposition. If you are new to spiritual exploration (and like the simpleminded narrative formula of mass-produced paperbacks), you might find some value here. But I say experience this book at your own risk. Look elsewhere if you are seeking something profound and memorable."
1,Just A Teaser From A Con Man,"MSI is a con man who started a cult and lures people in with some delightful books (like this one) and courses. Once you sign-up for the cult, you go through 6 months of classic brain-washing. But it doesn't hold - most members leave before 3 years when they slowly realize it is all a scam.Read First Thunder at your own peril."
4,My son could not stop moving!,"What a great DVD!! Not only did it get my son up and moving, trying to do all the exercises on the DVD (none-stop, from beginning to end!!), but it also showed him what to do if a stranger tries to approach him, grab him, etc. This is a MUST for every family that wants their children (of ANY age!) to be safe when they're outside playing or even just walking down the street. If my 5-year old son can understand and do what they say on the DVD, so can your 13-year old daughter.Better safe, than sorry."
3,Not the best,The book series is not my best bet for a person to learn arabic.The best book on the planet is MASTERNING ARABIC by jane wightwick it is superb combined with the audio tapes .The masterning arabic is superior in content and allows the person to see how words fall into place.Please try this book .The best way to learn arabic is to realise that it is different and varied in the way the words are formed this book shows that to the person who want to learn arabic so good luck
5,Wife loves them,"Got them as a present, wife loves them. Fit well on the face and colors are the same as the picture online."
5,Good deal price and quality,I bought it for my mother; she loved them; think is good deal and worthy for the price.
5,Love!,"My 11 yo Bolle sunglasses finally bit it. I read the reviews and replaced them with these - they fit great and the rubber nose really helps keep them steady. Look great, love the fit. nice price too!"
1,Where is it?,"Wish I could give an actual review, but I have yet to receive these sunglasses. I ordered them on May the 10th. I keep getting emails saying that it will take longer and longer to receive them. They now say it will take 7 weeks."
4,Fun,"I like this product but my husband complains that it hurts his legs and knees to ride on it. You are placed in quite an awkward position which may be difficult for someone that is not that flexible. There is a constant feeling that you are about to tip over while riding it, which is part of the fun.I enjoy it and my kids enjoy it too, but my husband doesn't like it much. I would recommend it if you don't have bad knees and have some flexibility to hold an awkward leg position for long periods of time.Also, it is very difficult at first for everyone to get on it without tipping everyone else over. You must get on one at a time so it's a little more time consuming than the ones that you just lay on your stomach and hold on. There's also a worry that someone will tip and hit their head on the side of the boat since you must hold it steady while everyone gets on it."
2,Why cover albums rarely work,"Joan Osborne is a good singer with a natural bluesy voice. For this album, however, she has chosen a wide range of music -- songs like ""Think,"" ""How Sweet It Is,"" ""War,"" and ""The Weight"". Having chosen these songs with very different emotional tones, she performs them all in the same sad bluesy tone. This tone strips the anger from ""War"" and the joy from ""How Sweet It is."" Unless you are a big fan of Joan Osborne, wait for her next album of original material."
1,Why ?,"Come ON people, are we in a fog here ? This record sounds like Bonnie Raitt playing a wedding reception ."
3,Not Satisfying,"I am a Joan Osborne fan, but this release is unsatisfying. The problem with cover songs is that 99% of the time, the original is much better. On this release, Osborne liberally offers her own interpretations of these songs, unfortunately, none of them add anything to the original, it detracts. There is nothing wrong with this cd, it is ok, her vocals are in fine form as always, but the cd should excite, not be on cruise control."
5,impressed!,"I am totally impressed with Joan Osborne. She's a gifted singer with loads of versatility and emotion. Though a covers album, Joan gives these songs new life and meaning, true originality and distinction.""Love's In Need of Love Today"" is a beautiful, melancholic anthem that is an obvious plea for peace and resolution. Joan's voice shines on the simple ""Everybody is a Star."" Joan's rocking versions of ""Only You Know and I Know"" and Aretha's ""Think"" are infectious. The bluesy ache heard in ""These Arms of Mine"" is sure to move you (at least a little bit!). Joan's ""How Sweet It Is"" is simply the best rendering of the song that I've heard, sexy and soulful (both of which are missing from the boring recording James Taylor made). I've been gushing about this album to everyone...can't say enough!"
4,Joan returns with uplifting messages,"I just ordered Joan's new album and the streaming previews are incredible. Her choice of covers is diverse, ranging from The Spinners ""I'll Be Around"" to Hendrix's ""Axis: Bold As Love"". Joan takes these and other classic songs by Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Sly and the Family Stone, The Band, and others, and reinterprets them with her trademarked soulful vocal style. I particularly enjoy ""Only You Know and I Know"", the gospel flavor of ""Love's In Need of Love Today"", her funky reworking of ""The Weight"", and her more faithful interpretations of ""Everybody Is a Star"", and ""These Arms of Mine"". The production is warm throughout the record with her vocals up front. Highly recommended."
1,Yuck,"I loved Joan Osborne on Relish, but something is out of whack here. Part of the problem is the material she's chosen; you would have to be Aretha or Patti Labelle to even begin to come within orbit of matching these classics. And while Joan is good, she is not that good. And while you don't have to be black to sing r&b, Joan fails miserably especially when she tries to use black slang. (i.e., when she sings ""I'm only tryin to school ya"" on ""Smiling Faces""; it sounds like Kathie Lee Gifford trying to cover Donna Summer). Don't bother."
2,"""war"" crime","This is a very uneven album. Some of the covers are excellent, including a powerful version of ""why can't we live together"" and a charming cover of ""everybody is a star."" But reducing the muscular anti-war classic ""war"" to a lounge-lizard crooner is nothing short of an atrocity. Osborne also makes the curious choice to eliminate the melody lines from two songs - Aretha Franklin's ""think,"" and the Band's ""the weight"", with fairly alientating results."
2,bor-ring,"The woman who gave us ""St. Theresa,"" ""Spider Web,"" and ""Righteous Love"" covers songs that she loves, but apparently doesn't understand. She does ""The Weight"" without its irony, ""How Sweet It Is"" without, well, its sweetness, and she delivers ""Smiling Faces Sometimes"" with all the skill and passion of a wedding singer.Forget this and grab Susan Tedeschi's marvelous ""Wait for Me"" instead."
5,SWEET LISTENING FROM AN AMAZING ARTIST!,Joan Osborne's latest effort in re-creating classic 60's and 70's songs is a stellar effort in every way! The highlight is her version of ARETHA FRANKLIN'S THINK! It is a masterpiece! She takes the gem HOW SWEET IT IS and slows it way down. She also slows down WAR and does a haunting and provocative rendition.....if you like great singing by a great singer.....rediscover the classics through JOAN OSBORNE! ENJOY!
5,Amazing,"Just hearing her version of Stevie Wonder's LOVE'S IN NEED OF LOVE TODAY is enough! This album is magnificient. A gift. Joy. Much needed after all the ""dreck"" released these days. Intelligent, smart and damn fine. Thank you Joan."
4,How sweet it is to hear Joan again.,"I have been anticipating this release for a while. Her voice is still bluesy - just like from her debut album, ""Relish"". Though ""How Sweet it Is"" may not hit the charts or spark a major single, most of her fans will appreciate this collaborative project.While most of the album resides in the heavy downtempo R&B ballads, Joan's sultry voice and use of different chord variations for these classics will make you play this album over and over. Highly recommended."
5,A Classic!!! Soulful and Clever. A treasure chest,"Right from the opening notes I was captivated. Why? Because, instead of faithfully duplicating the original or creating a commercially viable but emotionally washed out series of covers as his been the case with a great many re-makes by other singers, Joan Osborne pretty much re-defines these pieces.She knows her way around these songs. She cajoles, exhorts and beguiles. She has an intimacy with this material, as though she has wrapped herself in the very fiber of the material.An inventive and talented singer, she understands what these songs are about. She understands the underlying emotions. This woman is SOULFUL. Her renditions of these pieces stand, right now, you don't feel compelled to go running to play the originals, since her versions are that good.Joan Osborne shows you how to be an original while doing an album of other peoples material. This one is a keeper. A treasure chest."
4,Sweet? Perhaps Too Sweet,"Yet since it's Joan, in spite of the saccarhin vibe that permeates this disc..a three star plus one cos it's her..There's a polish to this that's just unnerving..it's ""nice"", but Joan isn't always ""nice""..This girl can belt from her bones and this disc is bereft of any such display..There's an obscure ep out there with a live version of Crazy Baby on it that reveals the depths of soul she posesses..If I had never heard her on that or seen her live...this would be a normal offering from a gifted singer, with ""nice"" background music to converse over..""Think"" and ""War"" have been interestingly re-arranged..but her rawness isn't evident even on those...and the rawness HAS to be integrated in there somewhere..at least for me...I'm going to see her at the end of the month and am anticipating less gleam and sparkle and more ""get down to business"" soul-searing fire...It's there..God luv her, it's there.."
5,The Queen of White Soul Returns...,"Here's an album of all covers, and it works well from beginning to end. If you love that atmospheric guitar and strings sound of the 70s, then you will adore this album. I just watched her perform live...and it was breathtakingly energetic. This woman's got power!!! The 12 tracks flow nicely although, this album is a bit more toned down than her previous two. Its definately a great one to put on during a cocktail party. With her third release, I definately find myself saying How Sweet it is, indeed..."
3,Easy read. Nice story. Lacks sufficient character development.,"The book was an easy read with a good story behind it (though at times there was a little TOO much going on). However, there wasnt a lot of character development. I characterize Diane's books as brain candy...its a fun read with not a lot of depth...but by no means boring or bad. Its like reading, as opposed to watching, a soap opera. I would definitely read more of her works."
5,well worth reading.,"You will not be able to leave this book down. I am addicted to Diane Chamberlain, She is a fabulous writer"
3,"More action, good emotion",Although I felt there was too much dialog and not enough action/suspense the relationships in the book were interesting. I actually was able to identify with the emotions some of the characters felt.
5,Effie is a great poet!!!,"I was just doing research for a class about Pikeville and came across Effie's name. I had never read any of her poetry, but when I read 1 stanza of Effie's poetry, I was hooked!!!!!"
1,Full Spectrum Disaster,"Please avoid lighting products from Full Spectrum Solutions. I purchased two, a floor lamp and a desk lamp. Both cost quite a lot of money but quite within the first year. Both lamps had blown electronic ballasts and burned out filaments in the bulbs. What a mistake to buy their horrible products! Please do not believe their unsubstantiated hype. Dont repeat my mistake!"
5,Even better than the original!,Loved the replacement carafe. Original carafe always leaked when pouring coffee. This one has a thicker spout and doesn't leak. I was very happy about that!!
4,Rating a carafe?,Truth is I would have given it a 5 stars if it were not so expensive. This is about twice as expensive as a replacement for Mr. Coffee but my wife loves her machine and I broke the old carafe.
3,Arrived broken,"How do you review a replacement coffee pot carafe anyway? I mean, it either holds liquid or it doesn't. Well this one works just fine, but it did arrive damaged out of the box with no evidence of rough treatment.So for that reason, I'd only give it 3 stars, although I do admit that my experience is probably not typical. If your luck is better than mine, I'm sure it will do the job."
5,Great for dry skin!,"My friend told me about this, but she hadn't been able to find it lately. I looked on Amazon where I always look first and voila! There is was. It has lanolin in it which differentiates it from other creams and lotions. It's great for dry skin and has a very slight ""clean"" fragrance."
1,ouch,Reading this book made me feel stupid. I felt like I needed to take a class about the moon to be able to interpret the information. I tried and tried to read it and it just made my head hurt.
3,Couldnt quite get into this book,"There are greater books on this topic. Usually I can devour a book in a short amount of time but this book was not intriguing; however, it was scripturally based but I prefer Pigs in the Parlor to this book."
3,Demons and Deliverance: In the Ministry of Jesus,Very practical. Takes you right alongside of Jesus various instances of deliverance.
2,Would you like to see what a waste of $[money] looks like?,"I really wanted to like this. I really thought I was going to...The CD has cool artwork done by Jon Zig who does the covers for Deeds Of Flesh, Disavowed, Disgorge etc.etc.etc. So I put the CD and was horribly disappointed. The production is horrible. The drummer can't follow through on drum rolls, and when he is blasting he usually stutters on the last few beats. The guitarist's riffs don't always follow what the drummer is attempting to do. The lyrics are infantile outbursts at an attempt to be death metal but come nowhere close to the bands that they emulate. All in all I was totally disappointed with this CD and now wish that I had picked up the new Crown CD instead. Whatever happened to good old death metal anyways? Why are all these hardcore guys trying to sing it?"
1,No way is this a 16 gallon trash can....,"Our 8 gallon is not much smaller. Shouldn't it be 1/2 the size?Not happy with the condition in which it arrived. You have to put it together yourself, and it didn't come with instructions..."
4,folk pioneer's classic set reissued,"I grew up with the music of Carolyn Hester, and this disc, a reissue of her third album, shows all the reasons why I'm still listening to her: that wonderful, unique voice (think Nanci Griffith with maybe a touch of Emmylou Harris or Claire Lynch); her willingness to explore and push the boundaries of the folk genre (there are blues and Greek music on this album, for example); her sense of humor; and impeccable taste in songs and how to present them in an involving way. Hester's always helped out the careers of other musicians, too. Notice the harmonica work-and those alternate takes featuring the harmonica? The player was Bob Dylan, in his first appearence ever on record."
5,Some Things Just Never Get Old,"A band so amazing as Aerosmith will live on through the years to come and will always have an impact on their listeners. A work old as this never ceases to give the same awesome feeling as it did back in 1973. Aerosmith made their way to me throughout my early childhood years and has remained one of my favorite classic rock bands. Their songs and lyrics also are a personal influence on me as their words are provocative and is germane to so many things that I see and face in life. ""Dream On"" is one of the best examples as I can relate to it from a religious point of view from my faith. Their views on life and religion is so strikingly amazing that their works never become old; nevertheless, living through the past few decades have imbued on them what many of us young people have not seen or experienced in life. As their works continue to inspire me musically and mentally, Aerosmith will remain strong in the future as it did over three decades ago."
4,More than just DREAM ON,"I bought this album for ""DREAM ON"" which is one of the most wonderful songs ever written. Unfortunately I didn't explore much of the album until I read ""Walk this Way"". Steven, Joe, Brad, Tom, and Joey didn't really think they gave us much of a classic here but even they were wrong. ""MAKE IT"" is a clear look into the mind of 5 kids from Boston yearning to be Rock Stars, ""DREAM ON"" is an obvious classic, ""ONE WAY STREET"" is a masterpiece of bluesy-rock, and ""MAMA KIN"" is a staple of the Aerosmith story, although the album track can't do the live version justice. ""MOVIN' OUT"" and ""WALKIN' THE DOG"" are also great songs to top of the album. Really only a couple of week spots, but its 30 years old and it still holds up."
5,Spectacular Debut,"On their self titled debut, Aerosmith shows the band's raw, loose and bluesy performance. Alot of their influence came from The Yardbirds era of rock n roll.The album starts out with the insanly catchy blues riffs of ""Make It"" and ""Somebody"". There is the obvious classic ""Dream On"" which gave them their first taste of rock n roll stardom. ""Mama Kin"" is one of their absolute early anthems. On ""Write Me"" Aerosmith show that blues is their major influence. And finally ""Walkin The Dog"" which has some cool vocals from Steven Tyler. Their debut is highly underrated, and compared to their extremely recent commercialism of Just Push Play, it sounds very pleasing to hear the bare bone blues and totally unique quality of their early music, and no where is it more apparent than on their debut."
4,not bad for a first try,"Good evening people welcome to the show. The rest is history. From the opening line of their first album over twenty five years ago, Aerosmith Hasn't disappointed. A couple weaker songs but the rest of them make up for it. Dream on the original power ballad, movin' out, mama kin, and walkin' the dog are great, and one way street is just a wonderful jam."
3,Good debut CD.,"Let's see.........it's worth it, but not by much. Good guitars, good vocals. OK lyrics. ""Dream on"" is the best one on here."
3,We Want Steven Tyler!,"This self-titled album is the debut for Aerosmith, and you can tell from the first song that they were going to be something special. This album boasts good songs with great riffs. The only downside is that for some reason Steven Tyler for whatever reason does not sing with his characterist screaming. He instead seems so laid back that his vocals don't go with Joe Perry's guitar playing. ""Mama Kin"" is good, but is much better live, with Steven's normal voice. Of course, ""Dream On"" is the first power ballad with the distorted sounds of keyboards and guitars. Overall, a better than average debut, but did not change the face of rock yet."
5,Their Debut Album,"This was their very first album, which debuted back in 1973 and celebrates it 40th anniversary this year. I found this one at Strawberries in April of 2011, and what a find it was! Steven describes the album as ""bare bones - it's just us and a guy playing sax on Mama Kin and that's it"", but that's all you need - the band and the music. If you're driving down the highway adn you've got ""Walkin' The Dog"" CRANKIN', do like Steven Tyler says and ""Roll down the window, and let the world in on your little secret"". This is one album that is a must-have for every every Aero Addict out there. I don't care what people say -AEROSMITH is here to stay!"
4,don't get me wrong,"I'll review this for the casual fan.It is a solid slab of hard rock but to me Steven Tyler sounds like he had no confidence in himself.That would change naturally.I do really like their cover of ""Walkin' The Dog"".Of course they quickly went on to become the superstars we know them as today.""Dream On"" is one of the most overplayed songs of all time."
3,Art books,"I thought it would be better but I have already read many anatomy books, if I was a beginner it would be fabulous"
5,Excellent exposition of human muscles,"I enjoyed watching this CD and learned the anatomy of the human figure that I have long wanted to understand. The CD is broken into clearly marked sections, so you can stop after the back muscles, for instance, and pick up later with the arm, etc. The live model is a well developed young man, who can define the muscles so that you can really see them. I believe well managed lighting helped with that. I am entirely satisfied with Anatomy for Artists, and recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their drawing and painting abilities."
3,intense reading,The good message of how to relate to seriously ill children is dealt with in too heavy-handed a manner for young children. Parents will want to preview the story before sharing it with children less than high school age.
5,An Exceptional Peanuts Book,"This book, or the video by the same title, is excellent for elementary school aged children confronting cancer in themselves or their families. I have donated multiple copies of the book and video to Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago for their use with young cancer patients and their families. The story is especially good for siblings of children with cancer, since it shows how they sometimes feel that they are being ignored, and their sister or brother is getting all of the attention. It also teaches a child how to defend a classmate against bullying, when the girl with cancer is made fun of for having lost her hair. My only reservation would be not to use this book with a child who has extremely advanced cancer, since of course the story has a happy ending, and it might cause the child to wonder why they don't seem to be recovering. Overall: well done, Charles Schulz!"
5,wonderful,"My little girl developed leukemia when she was 2 and 1/2 and THIS was the only and BEST way she understood that she was not alone and what she had(on her terms). I was SO impressed that Charles Schultz did this book/video, etc. As far as kids who don't have to deal with a serious illness, I think that this book is very well written for any child as to not treat others who don't ""look"" the same badly and know that God made us all different-or this world would be dull. I give thanks to the writer for such a wonderful story-HOPE included!"
5,Great Book,Book is rather long like a short novel but it has a lot of information and love Charlie Brown. This book helped me explain to my son his condition.
4,Round 4,This volume is unlike the first three. There is less action and more dialouge. The story is developed more. This volume is all about the past relationships. The next volume will definitely pick up on the action.
3,Cooks well but has a flaw,"I bought my Versa Pro about 3 months ago based on the feature that allows you to saute in the crock on the stovetop. I thought it would be great to be able to sear the meat right in the crock, but the manufacturer doesn't recommend that. You can saute veggies in it, but it should not be heated to the point you could brown your meat for good flavor and color. Also, I have experienced a problem I did not read in the other reviews...and that is the tendency for the crock to get moldy inside if you store it with the lid on. No matter how dry I try to make the crock (like towel drying it well then letting it sit out overnight) it still developes a bad smell and a bloom of mold inside if the lid is put on during storage. Seems the crock is made of a porous material that retains moisture. But it does cook well and I like the countdown timer and warm feature. If I had it to do over again, however, I would consider another model."
3,Not Exactly,"I already had a Rival Smart Pot and love it. I got this one for my vacation home but do not like it as much. First it was not as pictured on Amazon (the words Crock Pot was not embossed on the cover. Second, the description did not say you could not use the ceramic insert directly on an electric stove and you must use a grill on the bottom. I would not do this not to scratch my stovetop. I used it once and it does cook on a high temperature so you must use it for less time. I like it but not exactly what I wanted."
5,Cadillac of Crock Pots,This crock pot is marvelous. I love that I can use it on my stove top. I love that it has a auto warm setting. I am 100% pleased with this purchase!
5,versaware,I love this product. I had the old fashioned crockpot and wanted something a little more up to date. I am really glad I chose this. Having a timer is great but the best thing about it is being able to put it on the stove and than directly into the base and start cooking. It saves on pans and it saves time. Food turns out great.
1,Burns almost everything!,"We have owned crockpots for 25 years or more and this one is junk! It has burned Mexican beans dishes, augratin potatoes, roasts, etc. Way too hot! Operates as a mini oven. Rival has replaced 3 times and still it is a bad product. I think it is a fire hazzard.I gave it one star as there was nothing to show a negative star!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"I bought this gift for my Mother last Christmas. I wanted to try and eliminate the use of pots since this one could be put on the stove top, we could brown our meats or make our roux's all in one pot now. I was with my Mom when the lid on the pot shattered so we returned it and got a new one. I don't think she has used it since though. In the mean time, I went out to by myself one since I was using my old one about 3 times a month and I hated cleaning all the pots. I LOVED it until I started noticing water in the bottom of the base (the heating unit). I was cleaning it one night and I let it soak before I start scrubbing it and I noticed water all over the counter top. There was a hole that formed in the bottom of the pot, I am assuming this happened from cooking on the gas stove. I can't seem to find any phone number's or contact info. to see about getting a new one but I am going to purchase a Hamilton Beach instead."
5,Bon Appetit liked it,"I got this slow cooker based in part on a review from the April 2008 issue of Bon Appetit. They said it was the best ""deluxe"" slow cooker, noting that they liked it because you could brown meat in the pot on the stove (absolutely essential for slow cooker cooking), it had a count-down timer and an automatic warm setting when the cooking was done, and the pot is dishwasher safe. Sure, it could have a glass lid, but why do you need to see the food? I mean, if it's on, then it's cooking, whether you can see it or not!"
1,Cooks 'way too hot!!!,"Even though this slow cooker is much more expensive than others, I decided to buy this one because it is the only model that allows the cook to brown on the stove-top, right in the stoneware pot, thus retaining the flavor of the ""fond"", avoiding the use of a second pan, etc.Well, I should have listened to the other reviewers who warned that this model cooks too hot, even on the ""low"" setting. It's true.I tried two recipes. (Neither recipe required browning on the stove-top.) I carefully followed Rival's instructions exactly, as well as the Rival recipes exactly. Both recipes burned.I am returning this item to Amazon. I have now ordered the Hamilton Beach model that Consumer Reports rated highest."
3,Watch Out - Rival's Product Quality & Service is Horrible,I entertain a lot and bought 3 Rival crock pots - one had electrical problems (sparking) and the handles on one fell off after 3 months. It was nearly impossible to contact Customer Service. The pots worked well but I would never recommend the brand - try others (I now use All-Clad and Cuisinart)
1,Crock cracked during first use!,"I really wanted to like this slow cooker, and I did until the first time I used it. I read through the booklet and followed the directions, using it on my gas stove on med/low heat. I was browning a roast that I had taken from the refrig and left on the counter an hour prior to cooking, when I heard the pop. How disappointing! The reviews and video are all so positive and the slow cooker seems very well made. The search is on for another cooker of this size that probably doesn't brown!"
4,Excellent but pricey,good reliable crock pot with excellent capacity. Some design issues that make it harder to use than I would like but worth the money just a little more money than I would have liked.
1,Snapped in half on the first use,"Bought this model as a gift for my sister-in-law. She said she was cooking a stew in the pot. It was brand new, out of the box. About 30 minutes later, she heard a ""pop"" coming from her pot. The cookware was cracked in half and ruined her meal.I returned this appliance immediately and bought a conventional slow cooker like mine instead."
1,Poor Quality,"I ordered the unit after reading the many favorable comments. Unfortunately, when I received it, the lid did not fit the pot tightly - it was rocking more than my chair. I immediately returned it and ordered a replacement unit. That one too came in with the exact same problem. Amazon accepted the return and will not replace with like item until the Quality has been worked out."
3,"It's ok, but not great",I love the versatility of this crock pot...but it cooks way too hot for my taste. It boils on low and cooks an entire roast in under 4 hours (which I don't like). I put some spinach dip in it once and it scorched along the back and bottom of the crock :(
5,Best money I've spent this year!,"I've now owned this crock pot for about 6 months and can't believe I have lived this long without owning a crockpot! This thing is awesome!!! I love that I can brown meat on the stove or sautee onions before I set it to cook all day. Then to come home and have a full dinner cooked for me after working all day and sitting in traffic is the best thing in the world. To top it all off, only 1 pot to clean! My mom got it after I told her how great it was and she loves it as well. She uses crock pot liners and said it makes clean up so much easier! I need to find some liners now..."
2,Easy to break,"After a week, the handle broke off during dish washing. Glueing it back was only a temporary fix, as the lid is heavy, the handle was unable to support the weight over time after breaking, and eventually resulted in the entire lid breaking on the counter top. Ordering a new lid cost 25 dollars with shipping and tax, and arrived broken. I cannot recommend a product that is designed to be so frigile as this."
5,Great crock pot - high & low reversed,"Love the crock pot. I have used it to brown meat / saute onions on stove top before putting it in the cooker pot - that does work. Crock pot works great. I read in several reviews that the high & low settings were reversed. Didn't quite believe it until I noticed that when I started a recipe as they usually do with 1 hour at High to get things going then 6-8 hours at low to actually cook the meal that the contents barely got past warm when I did the 1 hour at high, but an hour or so later on low it was bubbling away and quite hot. After cooking 2 meals with this I did a test and sure enough... they are reversed. I did a water test several times and after an hour at each setting the ""LOW"" setting tested approximately 20 degrees warmer than the ""HIGH"" setting. Other than that I love the cooker."
5,my favorite applianc,Very happy with this slow cooker. You can use it on the stove to saute foods then just set it in the heating unit. I've had mine for a few months and it works perfectly. It's also very stylish. I've been telling everyone about how much I like it. Very good buy.
1,Does not warm up,I was so excited to get this slow cooker and was very dissapointed. I spent about 5 hours on high power to get some onions to brown and it never happened. I have wasted two things with trying to get this slow cooker to work.Don't get it unless you want uncooked food and disappointment.
3,Think twice before purchasing...,"The crockpot is nice. I have used it quite a few times since I purchased it a month ago. The product information booklet / cookbook could be better. The only means of contacting Customer Service listed is snail mail. I had to surf the web to find an email and phone number. VersaWare products are considered limited editions - EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T SAY IT ANYWHERE. Therefore, replacement parts are not available. How do I know this? Yesterday I dropped the stoneware lid and it broke into two pieces. Customer Service informed me that they do not make replacement parts for VersaWare products. So, basically I have a one month old crockpot that I can not use and I am out $70. Buyer beware!!!!!"
2,Too Hot!,"For all that is good about this crockpot, and there is much that is good, it has one insurmountable flaw. It has two temperatures: high and scorch. I have two words of advice for those who buy it. First, always test your recipe when you'll be spending the entire day at home. Its low setting is not low and many recipes will burn to a crisp, wilt to nothing, and/or boil to overflow within a few hours. Second, even the longest cooking recipe will, in this crockpot, be finished in 8 hours or less. Always set the timer - you can always turn the heat back up when you get home."
4,Already need the Ceramic Insert!,"I LOVED this slow cooker until after the 5 or 6th use, the Insert started cracking as soon as I put it on the stove. I am very careful with my appliances and did everything as instructed, so there was absolutely no excuse to why this happened. Now I am looking to purchase the Insert so that I could use it again! Other than the Insert cracking, this was the best cooker that I ever had! (And I have 3 more brands!) I use these Slow Cookers at least twice per week. A great way to feed your family when life gets busy!"
3,like but with reservations,"Overall I like the crock pot but I agree with other reviewers that the lid is an issue. It feels very fragile and I am scared to death it will break with just a tap. I also am disapointed with the bowl of the pot itself, the bottom middle slopes to the edges and is not flat, so it does not evenly brown. I am finding I am pulling out the frying pan to brown meat and then adding it to the crockpot like I have always done with other crockpots. I don't think I would spend this amount of money for this pot again."
2,"Worth borrowing from the library, but not worth buying","This book, while nothing new, seemed to me to be a half-hearted nancy friday clone. Save your money and buy ""Men In Love"""
4,great for kids,its one of the first books i read when i was in 4 th grade.for some reason it always stuck in my mind as fun easy reading book for young kids.I would like my son to read it when he reaches that age.
5,great book for children,"this is a great book for children who just started to explore the world of reading. the story is gripping and the next time you know, you are done reading."
2,Very Disappointed With This Flop,"I bought this Barbie for my six year old daughter. I have tried everything suggested in the reviews to keep the tail on but it keeps falling off. The jewel on the tail also fell off on the second day we had this doll and my daughter hadn't even had it in the tub yet. Perhaps I'm not pushing, twisting or gluing correctly???"
1,Don't waste time tail falls off,My daughter Cristina loved the Fairtytopia line of dolls and they are all beautiful but this mermaids tail fell off right away and we were not able to repair it. My daughter was heart broken she continues to play with Fairies with wings but has lost interest in the broken mermaid
3,Magical Mermaid Barbie,"Though my daughter loves this doll, it has been nothing but a problem since the 2nd day. The tail falls off everytime and so does her top. We have tried superglue on the tail and tape on the top...nothing works ! I wish so much it was more durable because it really has sparked a wonderful imaginary play...she loves to play ""mermaids "" with her 2 dolls but always ends up in tears because of the tails."
1,falls apart piece of junk,"My daughter has had this doll for about six weeks and hasn't played with it very much. The doll is falling apart. The top falls off constantly. The tail is cracked and broken where the doll bends. So unless you expect your children to keep the doll in it's box, and not play with it, get a doll that will be more durable."
1,she is no Ariel,"my 4 year old daughter was so disappointed, right out of the box the tailfin never stayed on the base of the tail. The doll looks like she was involved in a horrible fishing accident. Save your money, buy something else."
2,barbie collector,"My 5-year old daughter saved up her money for weeks to get this Barbie. The fin does not stay on the bottom of the tail, nor does it have any way to stay attached. I called Mattel to report this and they advised they had not heard of the problem. Their solution --I could mail the Barbie and they would send me a $10 voucher. I opted to return it to the store and just get a refund. My daughter was very disappointed."
1,poor quality,tail fall of everytimeher shirt broke my daughter uses whats left of her in the tub SAVE YOUR MONEY
1,tail aflls off,"Like other reviewers have said, the fin would not stay on from the moment I opened this toy. I have tried to snap it on but it won't stay. My daughter tries to play with it but it is hard for her to hold the fin on and play with it at the same time. I am dissapointed that Mattel would release such a poorly made toy."
2,Very shoddy quality,"My daughter loves this doll, so we have had probably half a dozen of them already because the little rhinestone will not stay on, and the fin will not stay on. Even brand new, the fin does not stay on. I have yet to buy one that actually stays intact for more than 5 minutes. My sister bought a bunch of these, and has had about a 50% success rate on the fin staying on.Overall, although my daughter LOVES this doll, I have to say the manufacturer should be ashamed of making something that would pass no quality tests. Shame on me for continuing to buy the doll in hopes that I would find ONE that actually stays put together."
2,Wish she'd never seen it!,"My 5 y.o. daughter LOVES this thing, she can't take a bath without it. The problem is, first the tail fell off. That was ok, we just put it back on. Then the jewels fell off, didn't matter, she still loved it. Then came the deal-breaker...the tail broke in half. Right in the knee joint, the tail just snapped. So now, I have to buy a new one, just so it can happen again."
3,Mermaid Woes,"My oldest daughter received this doll as a birthday gift on her 5th birthday. I do not know if the one we received was defective or if this is a design flaw, but we could not get the bottom of the tail (fin) to stay on. This proved extremely frustrating to my daughter. My younger daughter (3) loves dolls, so she is the one who tends to play with it, sans fin. As a water toy, it has proven to be somewhat novel for them and fun, but they need to fix the fin."
5,Splashin around,"I collect some of the early fairytopia dolls and this one really catched my attention. I bought one for my little sister and one to add to my collection. This doll is probably the prettiest doll we have. She has long ,wavy, soft beautiful hair with pretty purple streaks in the back. I love fantasy-like creatures and this mermaid is very beautiful and probably one of the best mermaid dolls around. Her tail has two pretty jewels and another jewel in the center of her pretty seashell top. I have no idea why people are complaining about the fin. My sister , of course, opened hers and I pushed in the tail fin till I heard a ""snap!"" and it has never fallen off. You just need to read the instructions more carefully and push in harder til you hear that ""snap!"" which there are two of I believe. This doll adds so much beauty to my collection and my sister just loves hers very much and plays with her constantly.This is a beautiful doll and in my opinion the best Fairytopia doll thus far."
2,The fin falls off!,"My 5 year old daughter was excited to get this toy, but lost interest quickly. The tail fin on the doll falls off everytimeyou pick up the doll. I would not have bought it if I knew this!"
3,Amusing and Informative,"This collection of chapters on the American West is an entertaining and informative glimpse into the history of our nation's most misunderstood and glamorized region, but the book seems to try and do too much, and thus ultimately accomplishes little. Dee Brown writes about Indian wars, life in a great cattle drive, and then shifts to such topics as the reading habits and wardrobes of gents and housewives in the old west. There is a noticeable lack of continuity in many of the chapters, but overall almost all of them were enjoyable and educational on their own. There are also some very unique photographs, such as a shot of Big Foot frozen dead in the snow. Brown has done his research, and while not all of his topics will fascinate you, it is easy enough to skip through the chapters you care little about, and to savor the excellent discussions of Wounded Knee, Dodge City, Geronimo, etc."
4,A good overview of Wild West history,"""The American West"" provides readers with an excellent overview of the colorful history of its namesake. Brown exposes the myths behind western legends like Geronimo, Billy the Kid, Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickock and many others. Perhaps most interesting are the chapters on the trailblazing of the cowboys and the perils they faced on their long cattle drives. Photographs are interspersed throughout the book and add to the story. I highly recommend this book to readers who are not terribly familiar with our western history and would like a nice primer."
3,"Disorganized, Superficial, but Interesting","The American West was a mess of disorganized, bad writing, full of typos, no source citations, and odd facts listed without any explanation or citations. The book jumps over thousands of miles and many decades, and is often repetetive. It is extremely superficial. I recommend in its place One Vast Winter Count by Calloway, which looks in-depth at Native American history. For all its faults, The American West was nevertheless entertaining, and a very quick read, likely to satisfy readers of Louis L'Amour--but not anyone looking for a scholarly account."
3,It's okay.........,"The beginning of the book, is pretty good. But as you read more into the book, it gets really really boring."
1,Not good enough,I feel like i payed too much for the set. The music seems to bore me after a few minutes. Not good enough for the money you pay.
5,absolute must read,I had Dr. Lomax as a professor and he is a brilliant man and his book conveys that. It is an absolute must read for anyone considering overseas assignments.
2,Straccio is the word,"Straccio, rags.... sadly enough Stefani is just a beautiful face having only two tracks on this album that are worth listening to, Un giorno d'amore (or to listeners from France, Tu sauras me trouver, doesn't really translate at all but good attempt at cracking into the francophone market). The other song was Uno Straccio d'emozione, Rags of Emotions. Else than that the album is much like David Charvet, dull-drum pre-edited love lyrics."
5,This BENCH is AWSOME,"I just got this bench with the pullup bar and the abs attachment. After shopping for a VKR and a BENCH for a month I stumbled onto this setup and WOW what a great product. The workmanship is first class it's packed well and it goes together in minutes! Best of all this bench can be every bench you'll ever need, flat, incline, decline, and the chinup bar is perfect. I bought this setup to hit the P90X work out program and it should work perfectly. If your looking for a bench this the one to buy you will definitley get your money's worth. They have many other great products to check out! [...]"
4,"Great construction, strong and sturdy","Definitely a great buy. Sure it might be on the more expensive end, but it is a very strong and sturdy. Everything you'd need in a bench. One thing that prevents me from giving the 5 is that the base could be a bit wider, just to give more stability especially if you're leaning on it with heavy weight. Imagine if you had to pick up some REAL heavy weight, I feel it might be possible to tip to the side if you became off balanced a bit.I use it for my home gym with dumbbells. I may invest in the chin up bar if I think it'll really support my weight without tipping. In any case, definitely a good bench."
3,Good quality but I wouldn't recommend it,"I bought this product to go with the Ironmaster adjustable dumbells (which I am extremely happy with), and although it is a good sturdy bench of good construction there are some serious design flaws - the seat can only go on at a 90 degree angle to the bench which is fine when sitting straight up or declined at a slight angle. But if you rotate it back any further it becomes a real pain in the rear (literally!).I basically only use it as a flat bench or as a straight up chair. Sometimes I will is use it a few settings above flat with no seat to do some incline bench, but most of the settings in between are useless.If you really want to do some seated incline, you need a bench that allows the seat to adjust separately from the back."
5,"Erasure, the best group in the world. Am I Right?","This album contains 21 (1 remix) of their success. Starting with ""Who needs love (like that"" and finishing with ""Who needs love (like that"" hamburg mix. My favourite ones are ""Sometimes"", ""A Little Respect"", ""Star"", ""Chorus"". 1 question: For when another album?"
3,Dr. Theo's Avosoy,"I have not taken and entire bottle yet so it's really difficult to review this item. I did notice that it is mostly glucosamine and chondroitin with vitamins C, E, Calcium, Manganese and sodium as well as 300 mg ASU b(Avocado-soybean.) I take multipule vitamins and wonder if I added the glucosamine and chondroitin, without the 300mgs of Avocado-soybean, I'd have the same results at a much cheaper price. I'm willing to finish this bottle and purchase another to see if taking two courses of 30 days each will show improvement."
4,Excellent introduction to the sai.,"Demura always does a wonderful job of introducing various Kobudo weapons. This book is no exception. If you are a beginner to using the sai, or you're an experienced martial artist interested in this weapon but have no instructor, you should find this a good introductory guide.Demura gives an excellent history on the sai, shows different types used in the past, as well as a good breakdown of basic techniques. Good kata and one-steps as well. Self-defenses are a little anachronistic - after all, sai v. sword fights don't happen all to often these days - but the applications are valid.Some law enforcement officers may have seen the rapid rotation baton. Like the PR-24 being inspired by the tonfa, the RR baton seems to be influenced by the sai.This book should open your eyes to the more traditional uses of the sai, and inspire you to come up with more ideas for yourself."
4,This is Saicko!,"Well what can I say, this book is an extremely solid study on the use of the Sai. Fumio Demura is a master instructor and practioner of his art. This book is a must for weapon enthusiasts and Karate practioners alike. All the basics are covered from stances to blocks and to strikes. This text will add to the knowledge of any Karateka regardless of his interest in the weapon or not. A fairly dated book now, but a bible for the Sai user"
4,Excellant,A great book to start with if anyone is interested in weapons. This book goes into great detail from the proper holdiing to forms and applications!!
3,Sai blocks? The bo is strong . . .,"An interesting book, but I wonder about the feasibility of some of the blocks he demonstrates. The bo is an extremely powerful weapon."
3,pretty good covers the basics,if your advanced don't get it .altough it does have some good stuff in it
5,A Salute To Buddy Rich,I was very happy with the item and how well it was wrapped up and boxed.It arrived to me very quickly before the due date.I was very impressed.
2,Overpriced. Terrible layout.,"This is a really thin book, and for the price, the production value is terrible. The graphic design, and poor layout, takes a lot away from the information of the book. Page after page, you wonder if this recent publication was from the 1980s.The information was light, and just skimmed over details. There was WAY too much emphasis on Analog. There are other search softwares out there. The case studies were nice, but no real insight was given.Overall - it's an overpriced fluff book. Could be summaried in 5 pages."
2,mediocre book about a potentially great subject,"This anthology looks at ""queer"" themes in Spanish-language and Latino cultural productions. Unfortunately, like many gay Hispanic books, there is too much focus on tedious Spanish materials and too little focus on the cool stuff that gay and lesbian Latino artists are currently doing. I prefered Munoz' ""Disidentifications"" and Manrique's ""Imminent Maricones"" much more than this. However, this is one of the first gay Hispanic anthologies, so I must give it some credit for its originality."
4,Very Good,"This was a wonderful story. I liked both Josh and Amanda very much. Amanda was a bit TOO naive, but you could see how she and the worldly Josh were so drawn to each other. It would have been nice to see a bit more of the villain. The 'dangerous mission' never seemed that worrisome. The relationship between Josh and Amanda was filled with emotion and doubts. They make a very romantic couple. GOOD READ! KCS"
2,The memories are faded,"I remember owning these on VHS as well, and in all honesty am a little disappointed at the video quality of these DVDs. I was hoping for at least a little bit better quality, hence the reason I re-purchased these on DVD. The picture quality is on par with my VHS which is a little disappointing. Otherwise, 3 VHS titles on 1 DVD is a good deal. I would've liked to share this with the new generation of NBA fans with a better video quality than my VHS tapes. Good DVD, but could've been executed much better considering the legends contained inside video."
2,"Re-recorded Versions, Some of them fair","As is the case with most St. Clair compilations, these are ""new stereo recordings by the the original artists"". The Lynn Anderson re-make of Rose Garden is good, as is the Freda Payne remake of Band of Gold. Maxine and Carole (Lead Me on and Doctor's Orders) are not bad. With the others, these female singers' versions exemplify how a person's voice ages/changes over time...they can't hold a note like they use to. BTW - Dionne Warwick song is from a live concert."
5,Excellent hat for winter running,"I use this beanie for cold -- but not the coldest -- days when I go for a run. It will keep your head pleasantly warm, absorb any sweat, and not let you take a chill. It comes in a variety of colors as well. I have light blue, black, and red beanies, as shown in the illustration.I also reccommend Glove Liners and Mountianeer Socks, see my reviews on those items."
2,Not much to write home about,"Trancemaster compilations come out very quickly, but the most recent ones have been fairly poor. This is probably one of the worst for a long time.Most of the tracks are boring. The only ones that really stand out are ""Sunset Beach"", ""April"" (nice acoustic guitar!), and ""The Silence"". But the last of those is many years old. 3 good tracks out of 22?It's about time that the Trancemaster series spent a bit more time selecting the best possible tracks for each compilation. Granted, there is less trance around these days, but it's still out there. I'd much rather see one or two Trancemaster CDs each year with 10-20 good tracks on each (they can't all be brilliant, but they can be better than this). There have been four instalments of Trancemaster this year, which is crazy when you consider how few tracks are actually worth a listen.A few hidden treasures, but nothing special."
4,Excellent Owner's Guide,"Jill Swedlow has written an excellent and informative book for the first-time Great Dane owner. Not only does it explain in great detail the responsiblities of the owner, but also tries to discourage those who may not be prepared for the demands of this ""Gentle Giant."" If you are purchasing a Great Dane for the first time, or just need a ""refresher"" on the care of your ""best friend,"" this is the book for you. I always have my copy handy. I truly enjoyed it."
5,A New Owner's Guide to Great Danes (New Owner's Guide To...),"My wife wants Great Danes and this book was a great place to get insight,and if she could handle these big, but gentle dogs. The book even as small as it is has every aspect of the Danes good and bad. Instead of one my wife now wants three! That's how informative this book is."
3,Shane's Amazon review of Desert Cities Map,"The map was delivered fine, folds well, and is durable (coated and wipeable) but the scale is very small. I found it hard to read."
5,High above the rest,This book captures the beauty and innocence of a time past but not forgotten. The illustrations make clear the story being told.
5,the magic of childhood,This is a beautifully told tale of the quintessential childhood adventure. The illustrations are magical. I recommend this for children as well as adults with the hearts of children as well. Encore!
5,Privacy Now,"So you think it's only in totalitarian societies that people can lose their privacy? 1984 and all that? ""Cybercash"" makes you think again. When the government teams up with super-computers and the public blindly goes along, say goodbye to your personal life. From the Patriot Act to Total Awareness, anything goes for a president who is determined to use his power to gain total control.This is what novels should do- make the reader question his own ideas and actions in the real world. Thumbs up to ""Cybercash"". When's the movie coming out?"
4,A Premonitory Political Novel,"Cybercash is what I look for in a political novel- intelligence, humour, suspense, and credibility. The back blurb says that the author has seen politics ""close-up and personal"". Intriguing... The plot pits a young Democratic senator against a Republican president, but in the end, it's a toss-up which party comes out as the least ethical and honest. Scary... Computers have given unprecedented power to the government, and coupled with the Patriot Act, privacy rights are a thing of the past. Premonitory...?"
3,"ok book, not great for stickers","As far as sticker books go, most sticker books allow you to put down a sticker and then move it around. This book once it is done, it is there. It also has dotted lines where the stickers should go. That is okay, but if they can't remove it some kids get upset when the sticker is not within the lines. I bought this for my two and 1/2 year old. He loves the wiggles, but got upset when he tried to put a sticker done and move it to the right place and the paper rips if you try to lift it up. Again, would have been better if they made it so you can arrange the stickers. A lot of sticker books are that way now."
2,What a mess,"Wow I'm glad I only rented this - I'd be furious if I'd paid actual money for it! Its like some computer-illiterate old guy was messing around on his new computer, fiddling with organizing old film clips and photos, and accidentally burned them to a DVD which somebody then mistakenly boxed up and sold. The mish-mash of content is STRICTLY of interest to people born in the very early 1950s and earlier, who have fond memories of Seattle's early rock radio scene, but its going to be frustrating for them because it does such a poor job of covering this magical era."
1,"What's that foul thing I smell? Oh, it's my new DVD!!!","Curiosity won out and I bought this stinking thing. I watched it and almost wretched. It was ""of Jerry Dennon, by Jerry Dennon and for Jerry Dennon"". Also, produced by, starring, featuring, created by, etc. Jerry Dennon. It should have been called ""Jerry Dennon"" so people would know not to waste their hard earned money on this ""thing"". The facts are distorted as is the quality of the production. As Norm says, ""buy a book"". As 60's Rocker says, ""save your money"". As I say, ""PHEW!"" Still trying to cash in after all these years..."
1,Can I give it a minus 5 review?,"I wish I would have been able to read a review before buying this DVD. It's not even watchable, mostly out of focus or fuzzy and less about the history than a tribute to the producer. Some of the copy was spoken at the speed of sound. I could have learned more about the subject in a cave. Save your money."
3,Louie Louie Has A History?,"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll see turtles in the sky!Well, not really. But, this video history of NorthWest Rock and Radio is a cool way to look back at a very magical time.I especially like seeing legendary KISN/Portland DJ Tom Murphy talk about the Kingsmen. Producer Jerry Dennon is all over this DVD too, so it's cool to hear his take on the 60s scene. You'll find yourself wanting more, but this quick look is worth checking out!"
5,John,"This is excellent! I recommend it to anyone who calls themself a Christian. It convicts the Heart and teaches the Soul. It's about truly following Christ, not just bolstering our beliefs in what we believe. From a man who lived to be twenty seven, it demonstrates the Power of the Spirit in a resigned soul."
5,Hail Unlord!,"Some of the best Thrash/Black Metal ever produced!!!!!Worth whatever it takes to possess this classic, amazing music! A must for thrashers everywfere and anywhere!!!!!!!!Get It!!!NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,I will not repress my feelings about this book.,"I don't like the theories in this book, and I don't like the class for which I have to read them. SO I guess that makes me a little biased. Also, I've only read part of the first chapter.Nonetheless, I can objectively say the authors are bombastic ego-strokers who probably met in a small, dank office in the basement of a ivy league college library, bonded over the insufferable stupidity of most other Americans, got married and then produced this book as a castigation to every feeble-minded psychology student who didn't take latin. Note: the sentence you just read is about a quarter the length of those you'll find in this book. I'd rather try to read the Sound and The Fury in braille than start the second chapter of Psychoanalytic Theories of Development.There. Now I feel better."
5,LEONARDO WOULD BE PROUD,"This CD is by far the best work of James LaBrie to date. Steve Walsh of Kansas fame also lends some incredible vocals. If you enjoyed Explorer's Club Age of Impact, you will love this."
2,Absolute Train Wreck!,"Okay, perhaps it's not as horrible as Trent Gardner's other recent project, Explorers Club ""Raising the Mammoth."" But I really should have learned my lesson with this guy after the halfway-decent ""Age of Impact"" (the first Explorers Club album).Gardner has no ear for melody! ZERO! Here we get more of his awkward writing with good singers struggling mightily to salvage it. And as another reviewer pointed out - the sound is awful!With all of the top-notch progressive rock being put out today, there is no excuse for something this inferior. I have to believe that all of the 5-star reviews here are written by Gardner's friends and family. Trent, please, go back to law school or whatever it was that you were doing before you decided to become a musician!"
5,Beautiful,"It's fantastic. Especially Dream Theater's James LaBrie's voice on ""Shaping the Invisible"". One of the best voices today! The duets ""First Commission"" and ""This Time, This Way"" are incredible. Gardner's songwriting talent is indubitable. Prog and Magna Carta at their best. Highly recommended."
1,Dreck for a genius,This thing is SERIOUSLY overwritten. The composer values over-orchestration above content. I suppose that fans of early music by YES and Rick Wakeman would find this interesting...the music is THAT derivative (with lots of stealing from Queen). If you're looking for an intelligent musical about Leonardo...this is NOT it.
4,"Good product, damaged in shipping","This is a very nice set, attractive comfortable and pretty sturdy. Our big disappointment was that it wasn't packaged well enough for shipping and as a result, the wicker cords were severed in several places and starting to unwind. It was too expensive and difficult to ship it back considering the great price, but now we're stuck with a permanent glue/duct tape situation that we still haven't gotten to work . . ."
3,Buyers Beware,"My package finally arrived. Trust me -it was not easy to assemble. It took 3 of us about 5 hours to get this together. The resin wicker pieces were unraveled in a few pla ces but an easy fix with the hot glue gun. We were also short a could of the D screws but were able to improviseand finally get this together.Yes, it is a fabulous item to look atand to sit on, but a total nightmare to assemble.BUYERS BEWARE!"
4,Very Nice Outdoor Furniture,We got this set about 6 months ago and it's a very comfortable and holds up nice in the weather on our screen in porch. It takes a little while to assemble but it's not too hard. It comes in a large box so be ready for it when it arrives.
5,Great product.,"This patio set was just what we needed to replace our old chairs in our flooded cabin. We need lighter weight furniture to move just incase it floods again. It was pretty easy to put together and like someone else wrote, there was just one flaw, the plastic rattan had been cut and was uncurling around a chair leg. For the money it is comfortable and sturdy. Wish I could find a couch as comfortable."
1,"Waste of money, just go online.","This books is very out of date, and empty.Just go to any search engine (AOL, YAHOO, MSN, ALTAVISTA, MAMMA etc) and type in ""Caribbean Medical Schools"", and you will get several websites with info that is a lot more in depth and current, than what is in this publication."
2,basic information with no real guidance,it didn't answer the real questions people have. is this school recommended. what percentage of grads have passed usmle. what hospital affiliations do schools have. how fast and honest a school answer tough question. a real disappointment.
1,Worthless. A total waste of time,Offers nothing that you can not find already on the internet. Very superficial.
1,this book should be pulled out of print,anybody who recommends this book is a mole or the author himself. what a disgrace. not even basic info.
2,"Below Average Book. Out of Date, Need New Information",The information is old. Need new information. Does not provide enough clinicals or details.
5,Great resource,"The book provides a summary of facts about all the Caribbean medical schools -- loans, island life, curriculum, etc. It also updates you on current US IMG board pass rates and residencies. Before making the 'big' decision, read the book."
3,Practicing Engineer perspective,"As an engineer in the medical device business with no background in tribology, I found this book overwhelming. The concepts of elastic and plastic contact, adhesion and deformation/plowing are useful and will guide our testing and product development. Finding those simple relations between material properties, contact pressure and contact area/friction required wading through a lot of difficult equations and graphics. Those of us who graduated as engineers and entered the empirical business world quickly forget the theoretical world of academia.If you are concerned about ""rigor"" and need/want to go deep theoretically, this book is probably a good one for you. If you have no tribology background but your business has developed a need to better understand it, you will find this book requires a lot of work to comprehend."
1,Batteries die without reason,I love the drill but the battery life is a real problem. I had both original packs replaced under warranty when the charger reported them bad. Now one of the replacements is flashing bad on the charger. These have been cycled maybe a dozen times. I'll be complaining to Makita and also reporting this on the various woodworking groups I support.
3,I guess they are all headed downhill,"I replaced a 14.4 Milwaukee NiCad with a Makita LXT and noticed that my old Milwaukee NiCads outlasted these in terms of longevity. Run time is solid, but lifespan is short. Two dead after one year, I'm only a homeowner. I've only done a few lengthy jobs such as putting cement board down in a 10x20 room, and building a deck with these, in addition to the other basic tasks of drywall, and other light construction needs. Love the light weight though. Now, I need new ones. Somewhat disappointing."
1,cash cow,"These Makita batteries are the worst ever. I don't mean these specifically but the design is flawed and it always has been. search around the web and you'll see what I mean. I have thousands of dollars worth of makita lxt so I'm stuck with these $100 bateries that fail after the warranty expires like clock work. I baby them. never drain them, never charge hot, etc. they work fine then you go to charge them and the smart charger starts flashing and beeping and that means your out of $100 bucks!Try to get them to charge 3 times and they lock out the battery and it's junk no matter what, door stop."
1,Like owning a boat,"A boat is a hole in the water you throw money into. That's the case with these $80 paperweights. I replaced both my Li-ion batteries on warranty, then one went bad about a year later. I replaced it, but now the other one is bad. I'm a home handyman now, and this drill hasn't had that much use.My old 12 v Makita drill lasted for years with hard daily use (I was a professional handyman). It had almost as much power as this 18 v piece of junk, but weighed about 2/3 as much.I used to have great faith in Makita, but this is the last straw. I'll stick with this one remaining battery. When it goes bad, I'll buy another drill...NOT Makita!"
1,A warning to those buying this battery,Both of my batteries did not last 3 months. I am going to try to warranty them but I have no working batteries for my Makita tools at this time. They seem to go anytime they get hot. Terrible design. At 80 dollars each be cautious.
5,Works great,"I modified my Makita saw to accept my 1.5 volt batteries from the Makita drill I have. They worked good but sometimes didn't have the power to cut through heavy items like when I was cutting through a piece of 2"" chain link fence pipe. This battery supplies enough power to cut most anything. I only have on since my drill batteries also work."
4,Exactly as promised,Exactly as promised. About 45 days after purchase the charger was telling me the battery was bad. I contacted Amazo(since it was after the 30 day return policy) they quickly shipped a replacement. Awesome customer service :)
4,keep track when recharging...,"it seems to me that reviews and my experience suggest that to prolong the life of these batteries one should keep them on the recharger only as long as it takes for them to be fully recharged... leaving on overnight, or longer than the full charge is reached, is unnecessary and probably harmful..."
2,Ditto,"Ditto on the hate the Makita batteries! I was looking into buying some batteries but had a bad taste of how long they last and have been debating on whether I should make a switch, they do have some great tools. But the batteries make it so that you don't want to buy anymore tools. Wake up Makita!!"
2,no-name batteries,"I just purchased 2 batteries sold as Makita BL1830 18-V LXT. The batteries have no Makita label or TM which leads me to think that they are no-name knock-off's. The battery case is almost identical and fit both my tool and charger but I haven't had a chance to work them to assess the performance. Even if they don't last as long as name brand, they seem to be a good value. Amazon--don't let your suppliers put stuff out as brand name and ship knock-offs."
2,These die early,When they work they work well however mine only lasted ~1 year. I took it apart and it had two bad cells. For the price they should be more reliable. I wish they would make these so that you could replace the cells.
2,Seeing red and green flashes of premature death,"The red green flash of death. 2 of my first set of three will no longer charge around one year with little use- like many reviewers here. The culprit apparently is a self discharge of a single cell monitoring the battery. I have reluctantly bought two more to keep my LXT tools but will like to see Makita admit to this significant flaw. Even if its fixed or they do not deserve to have anything but two stars for their entire, otherwise solid, LXT lineup. By sweeping this flaw under the rug they have deservedly lost a lot of trust.Here is a idea, swap out any battery for free with less than 200x cycles-----> no matter how old."
1,I'M WITH THE BATTERY REVIEWERS,"I'VE WRITTEN ELSEWHERE ON AMAZON ABOUT MY HORRENDOUS EXPERIENCE WITH THESE BATTERIES. IT'S AMAZING THAT MAKITA DIDN'T RECALL ALL OF THEM AND WORK A FIX TO REPLACE THEM. BUT, AS THEY SAY: THAT'S SHOW BIZ. THEY'VE LOST ME AS A CUSTOMER. ON A MORE PLEASANT NOTE, I'VE BEEN USING AN 18V. BOSCH DRILL DRIVER , ALSO WITH LITHIUM ION BATTERIES, AND IT'S PERFORMED LIKE A CHAMP, DRILL AND BATTERIES AND CHARGER. MY MAKITA NI CADS ARE STILL WORKING WELL. I'M LOOKING AT A NEW COMPRESSOR FOR THE SHOP AND THOUGH MAKITA IS HIGHLY RATED, I WON'T DO IT. I'M ALSO ABOUT TO BUY AN SDS HAMMER DRILL AND , AGAIN, BECAUSE OF MY BATTERY EXPERIENCE WITH MAKITA, THEY ARE NOW OUT OF THE RUNNING."
3,"Picture was wrong, poor shipping","When I first saw this item it had a picture of FOUR batteries, not three. Unfortunately I did not notice the ""3-Pack"" when I quickly placed my order. It would have been cheaper to buy them singly with free shipping. I sent Amazon a quick feedback email and the picture was changed almost immediately. Also, the batteries were thrown into a USPS box with newspaper. One of the batteries had worn a hole in the box, but appears to be ok. Buy at your own risk."
1,Had to replace more often,"Battery does last pretty well between charges. BUT, it does not last as long before you need to replace it with a new one as our old 'yellow and black' branded ones. Seems it would cost us a lot more in the long run to keep replacing these batteries than sticking with dewalt"
2,Batteries don't live long.,Upgraded from Rigid to Makita last year. I love the tools the are strong and precise. The batteries are another story. After 1.5 years of use 3 of the 4 batteries we have are dead. No support from makita. The told us that the angle grinder probably kills the batteries prematurely. I would not buy makita again and when this set of tools dies I will go with Bosch.
1,Multiple battery deaths,"Just like a lot of other people, I've had multiple batteries (both 3amp and 1.5amp variety) just suddenly refuse to charge. Too bad because I've been using the Makita LXT series for over 3 years and have about 7 of the tools. I simply can't keep pouring money into these expensive batteries that can die at any time. Time for me to jump ship and switch to another brand.UPDATE Dec 2012: I have switched to the Dewalt 20v line and so far it has been working fine. Dewalt doesn't offer as many different tools as Makita but all the major ones are available."
2,dead battery,bought two batteries and within 3 months will no longer take a charge...not worth the money consider them disposable batteries
2,battery doesn't perform as the manufacturer say,"I have been using the combo kit only occasionaly on weekends and two times a month. The drills work fine as do the flashlight. The circular saw drains the battery after about fifteen minutes of cutting, and then cutting time gets shorter and shorter. Now the battery doesn't want to charge at all. I wouldn't place my faith into what the manufacturer claims about the number of cycles you can charge these lithium batteries."
5,Makita 194205-18 Volt LXT Battery,"Good price and product. Happy with it all, especially receiving it in a timely manner."
4,Quality product,Nice product at a fair price. Shipping was fair and quick. I will look forward to shopping with them again.
1,Is there a easier way?,Your returns policy states there is a charge to return because it was are fault.We want to exchange for something in our cart and meets the requirements.Is there a way to communicate that besides this.
1,battery 18 volts,"I bought this battery and used very littleto my surprise not get charge any mor ""they last very little""the warantee was too shortthen my next purchase will not be hereI will buy on storethem I can make the switchMakita BL1830 18-Volt LXT Lithium-Ion Battery"
5,The BEST,I use these battery a lot and it keep doing GREAT job!!I will recommend to all my friends to buy this kind.
1,Makita Batteries are junk,"I bought the Makita kit containing a driver, drill, saw and flashlight. My 3 Amp Lithium battery died after about 3 charges. I called Makita and they will not replace it. Now I am worried that of the 2 batteries I received with this kit, I soon may have none. I have been hesitant to buy a replacement battery since reading this reviews of fear taht I might just be wasting my money. When I bought a set for my son, I switched to Hitachi and I will not buy any more Makita products since they do not stand behind there product."
4,Makita 18V lithium battery,"I like the small size, low weight, and high power capicity of these batteries and the associated Makita tools. My only complaint is that some of the batteries are tight and very hard to remove from the tools. This problem tends to become worse with use. Also be careful with the charger - is works well but is VERY dellicate and will break / cease to function if dropped or banged around."
2,Batteries fail,"I love Makita tools, but these 18 volt batteries have a serious design flaw. They work well, charge quickly but will fail to charge and need to be thrown out way too early. In a little over a year, the battery would no longer charge. Makita says that the problem occurs with home users who let the battery run all the way down. I never let them run all the way down, and I had 2 fail. Makita is in serious denial. The home users of other batteries have no where near the problems. Read the Amazon reviews. I have never seen so many complaints about batteries. I am stuck with 6 Makita tools that are powered by expensive, deeply flawed batteries. Since Makita refuses to recognize the problem, no solution is in sight. Buy other tools."
2,convenient brick shape,"I have 2 of these batteries which I purchased in late 2008. One had not been used much, possibly 20 cycles over the past several years, but it is now literally a brick thanks to the issues previously described with the board locking the charger out. I can see that the pack has about 16V yet it will not charge up. I know this is an older pack, however it has not been abused and since it seems designed to fail when it still appears to have a usable life is very unfair. Ironically my other battery purchased with the bad one is still going strong and it has been used much more - which is probably the key since they drain one cell for the circuitry. I think that the poorly designed board on the battery contributed to the premature death of the bad one. Fortunately I am not invested in the Makita tools, and I won't be after this."
1,bad battery,"I have many makita tool and they are fine except the battery, they die in about a year, Dewalt batteries last for much longer than Makita, how it can be, I agreed with another person idea of Makita trying to make extra money by short life batteries, it sucks. I started buying Festool products and let me tell you, everything is so much better.I'm a professional woodworker and I keep my batteries charged all the time and uses them a lot."
1,displeased with battery life 1 month after Warranty and the barely work,"This rating is about the battery onlyDrill performed as expected and has the power needed in a very lightweight drillBut - The battery(s) after 14 months hold a charge for 24 screws (3 inch into treated lumber).Since it is both batteries I am guessing this is a design ""feature"".This seems to be the Gillette model of creating a product with an ongoing revenue stream and I resent being that stream...Always bought Makita but if they are asking for $150 each year there are better alternatives. Like multiple less expensive brands."
1,dead after twenty charges,"I called the 800 factory service number, Makita says they will only warranty for one year. Nothing in the manual says that if you dont keep these charged they will die, but they will. For about ninety bucks, that is terrible. I am a very disappointed longtime (now ex) Makita customer. Will look for clone batteries, then elsewhere."
3,works,it works so far. i didn't like the packaging at all- seemed like they just opened a box and threw it in. there was no makita packaging or paperwork. but i can't complain because i went with the cheapest guy on the list! so far no problems and its been two months.
2,Bad Choice,"When we got this battery, it didn't even a hold a charge for an hour. Amazon was great about replacing it. This one seems to be doing better. Can only hope."
3,I'm Not Impressed with this battery,"I bought the 4 piece set 3 years ago, but have only used the drill and the skill saw. The batteries have very good power when new and freshly charged but started falling off after the first 6 months or so. At this point they will still take a charge that run's the drill fine but not the saw. I do not run them clear down before charging and it is never more than a month or so between useage. If it wasn't for the convienence of the cordless tools I would not use anything except for the corded variety, but even with the high cost I will continue going partially cordless. I take good care of my batteries and tools and follow all instructions for battery care, and have used cordless drills, (the Makita 6012 HD as a starter) since 1980 and have not had a drill since the 6012 that has lasted as I feel they should."
1,Hacked Up,"This movie has been cut from the original. The real Tarzan Escapes had many more harrowing experiences including multiple crossed tree episodes. This only had one, and it was even cut. Don't buy this if you think you may be watching something you remembered as a kid on an afternoon after school. Should not even be offered unless restored to the original...I want a refund"
4,You may all prophesy,"This is a very good book. My husband is enjoying more than I am. I think is has to do with the different way of thinking and feeling (male-female brains)I haven't read the book completely (almost) since my husband takes it to work and reads it during breaks. I am looking forward to gather everything together and get the best of it. So far, I think is a good guidance but not the ultimate rule."
5,Fuzzy made clear,There have been many books written on this subject but this by far has been the best. Simplistic and scripturally based so that the hard-headest Corinthian can understand personal prophetic ministry.
4,Alabama 25 years - livin lovin rockin,Just superbfinally able to listen to carolina mountain dewe which i do not hear enough - nice to have all their hits at my finfer tipsBob
1,Poor German Dictionary for Americans,"This German Dictionary does not have German pronunciation guides. It has only English pronunciation guides, which is not very useful for an American trying to learn German."
5,Excellent Dictionary,"As with any book by Webster, this is an excellent acquisition for any student of the German language. Any person that is is involved in the proccess of attempting to master another language knows that, in order to achieve such a goal, having a good dictionary is primordial. Look no further, kameraden! I guarantee you this is the one."
3,works well,"This dictionary has worked well for me so far during my time in germany. Sometimes when words have multiple meanings or lots of idiomatic expressions, the entries are a bit long and confusing."
3,O-K,"This is a good German dictionary for beginner/intermediate students. However, if you are doing much heavy-duty translation (history, political, philosophical texts) and/or you plan on continuing your German studies for a number of years, I would recommend the Oxford-Duden, as it has a much clearer and easier to read format and has pretty much every word one can think of (it also makes a better doorstop)."
4,Good dictionary for the money,"Bought this for my college level German 3 course and it has definitely come in handy. Only qualm I have with it is that it does not tell you the gender of the nouns, which is a problem when writing essays. I would definitely recommend this to German students."
4,Great value - I like using it.,I am a first year German student. This dictionary has every word I've looked for. The white pages are nice. I felt the price was reasonable. I'm pleased to have purchased this dictionary.
5,"Suspense, humor, romance and baseball!","Helma Clark delivers the best of summer by skillfully packaging all four elements into her first novel. Her characters are human and her dialogue is terrific... I found myself laughing out loud at some points and hanging on the edge of my seat at others. The plot twits in The Big Game are inspired, far beyond the usual romance fare. I'm looking forward to more of Ms. Clark's works."
2,"Good Singer, Bad Album","""I Know"", ""Passion"", and ""Blackbird"" are the only stand outs here. I know this is a mid-nineties cd but still the idea of having two skits with David Alan Grier doing his *In Living Color* routine should steer you away from this totally. Her fantastic *Hopeless* from *Love Jones* shows that this woman can sing. Up there with Lauren, Jill and everybody else. I just wish she'd come back out and put out at least a good single every year. Sumptin'. Just no more skits. Please."
3,Wild Seed ~Wild Flower - - actually 3.5 stars,"This is a good debut from an artist who burst on the scene with a phenomenal single, I KNOW. This song featured a mash of rock, pop & soul that touched a lot of fans across music genres. The only other song on the disc that moved me in the same way is, PASSION - that features a stunning baseline, unstructured melody & terric guitar-heavy chorus.Other tracks that I still enjoy to this day are:NOW OR LATER - she really toned it down on this one, her vocals are so sweet & light11TH HOUR - features spoken word & a pretty melodic beatWATER - her soulful wails & the construction of the song kind of reminds me of an old Rufus & Chaka Khan songBLACKBIRD - again features really pretty vocals"
4,I KNOW WHATCHA DOIN!,"Dionne Farris completed her debut album with a VH1 ready infectuos tracks, the leading single couldn't be the path to judge this album, ""I Know"" it's a truly pop-rock gem that it is easily to follow and listen, the rest of the album has and R&B-jazzy, blues rock kind of way, touching less zappy topics than I know, been more obscure and selfconscious, Farris has a talented voice and her delivery it's just missing that second single that could have taken her beyond the One Hit Wonder title, but this album has so deep lyrics that didn't actually was searchin' for commercial approval an error to a debut album that has to appeal to much wider audience, but even do, a great album for someone who's looking for meaningful lyrics and touching songs that are not radio ready."
3,I Know rocks - the rest of the album is growing on me,"I got this album used, years after the song ""I Know"" was big on the radio. I heard it again, and thought, ""I really like this song."" I still do. For the price of the album is was worth it. The remake of ""Black Bird"" is cool too, but the rest of the album hasn't quite grabbed me yet."
5,EXTREMELY CREATIVE - GREAT SINGER,"I love this CD - I loved the Single back in 1995 - It sounds as if it was ""DROPPED"" yesterday! J A C"
1,no,"please do not buy this. she has a great voice, but the only song worth anything on here is the 'i know what you're doing' single...."
3,Donut spirals downward,"Between ""Mule"" and ""Untidy Suicides,"" Alice Donut ditched their bass player and second vocalist Ted Houghton. Whether Houghton was the brains behind the band's wild, sophisticated pyschedlic-punk style of just plain damn fun music, or they ditched him to try something else, something plainly went wrong with this album. Compared to earlier Donut work, it is much darker and more sinister in tone, and musically it shows a strong heavy metal influence (relative to earlier Donut works). You can hear that it is the same band, but suddenly something has gone awry. While the lyrics are stronger than those of the forgettable ""Revenge Fantasies of the Impotent"" album, the musical style has lost the verve that gave Donut their unique appeal."
4,Everlast Zone Pilates,It broke the first day I used it. Because it was the lastest price anywhere I fixed it by adding 2 small screws to hindged part on both sides at 180 degrees for the present screws design since the present design the screws fit into a slot and the screws just pull out of the slot. I dumb design.
2,And so on.,"Page 27: ""When naming binary covalent compounds formed between two nonmetals, a third system of nomenclature is preferred in which the number of each atom in a molecule is specified by a Greek prefix: di- (2), tri- (3), tetra- (4), penta- (5), and so on.""And so on? What kind of review book doesn't give you all the information you need?That said, the book is nice because of it's brevity. Other review books have lots of examples worked out, this one doesn't, so there's less to flip through, and it's small & light so you can carry it around easily. Of course, solved examples are good, though my textbook has more than enough & my professor gives us sample tests with answers.But damn, if it's missing this, who knows what else it's missing."
3,what is that high pitched noise?,"Listen to the ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" sample and tell me you don't hear a high pitched buzz. I might have bought the CD if not for that."
1,I did Not get it.,No stars I did not get this as it would not download. so I canceled the order I hope you did not charge me for what I did not get.
3,This dress is OK...,"The style is nice,but quality of fabric and of work on it is cheap,like the dress was from Walmart:("
5,Dirty Delight,"Prisoner of X is packed with pathos, triumph and tragedy of the most hilarious kind. Read it and revel in juicy scoops, shady characters and hot babes. MacDonell is a brave and wildly funny writer."
2,Not that Revealing,I had high hopes for this book but I was a little disappointed. Parts of the job I wanted to know about were glossed over and boring things were described in excruciating detail.
4,Brandston at their best,"Excellent album on a new label. Formerly a Deep Elm band, now with the Militia Group, could be the best album put out by this band. I have to say, I got kind of tired of the Deep Elm stuff. Not to say it was bad, I just felt it was getting too sugary, and maybe the vocals were annoying me. Too whiny or something. I gave the new album a chance because I read a decent review. All in all the songs are great. Their is good diversity between the songs and each one is addictive and catchy. The vocals, work on this album. Dual vocalists each with a unique style that blend well together. Not sure why this band hasn't gotten bigger on the indie radio and video stations. Recommend to fans of Jimmy Eat World, Sense Field, etc."
2,Send Us Something Decent,"I've been a fan of the bands for a couple of years but was very diappointed in this effort. A bit more produced than the earlier stuff but none of the songs rise to the level of previous standouts - really B tracks throughout. If your exploring the band some of the best work is; Shannon Said, Holly Park and Leaving Ohio."
5,"Cute book, great story!","This book was perfect for teaching my daughter about being different, and bullying. Its written by an adult, on a child's level, and has lots of great illustrations that even the most distracted child can benefit from. I would recommend this book many times, to parents and teachers all over. The author took risks, and while doing so, put together a very charming read. Looking forward to her next submission."
