4,Great Value,"Having owned and played many different digital pianos over the years I can confidently say this is near the top in feel and sound for 88 key weighted action. Sure, you will get a lot more flexibility and function for 2 to 6 times the price but if you want something simple with good feel and basic sounds I doubt anything else comes close at this price."
5,Great piano for the price,I got this piano for my daughter to start lessons on. I have used it almost every day since Christmas. It has a piano style feel and great sound. Haven't used the computer options yet.
3,Mas O Menos,"En este album el surf un poco mas calmado, no tambueno como el primero en mi opinion (4) ese si que estava Rock, pero un camarada mio dijo que pensaba que estaba mejor que el primero bueno cuestion de gustos tracks mas cortos algo para escuchar como musica de fondo."
4,Trailer Park of Terror,"Good price for this slasher type movie, i really liked this movie it was a good old scary movie 5+++++"
1,Hardcore low rent horror,"Heads getting ripped off (at least one), low budget everything, and a shaky plotline are reasons that I stopped watching this movie before 30 minutes had passed. I sold it and regretted the waste of my money. It's not a family film unless you're the Addams Family and it didn't make enough sense to keep my interest. I can indulge in some gore, but found this undigestable."
2,A Waste,"I thought this ""zombie"" film was a wasted effort. I've seen much better zombie films and this compares poorly to them. I wouldn't recommend it outside of horror buffs/ diehard horror fans."
3,Trailer Park of Laughs & Gore,"We all know that Zombie flicks can be good, bad or ugly, this was just hilarious & wasn't what I would call standard Zombie fare! There were a couple of almost made me jump moments, however more time was spent laughing and watching my son roll his eyes. Best of all you learn that Duct tape really can fix anything!!! I honestly wish I had borrowed this movie instead of buying it - I bought it hoping to see more of Trace Adkins but his role is very small, all in all it is worth a watch and a giggle."
3,Not a Zombie Movie,"I love zombie movies, but this is not a zombie movie. There's no eating of braaaains and you can't ""kill"" them by shooting them in the head (I assume, since nobody actually tried). It's just a bunch of pissed-off re-animated redneck corpses who have to kill any visitors to their trailer park before sunrise. It's more Texas Chainsaw Massacre than Night of the Living Dead. But, cheesy (of course). Aside from the lack of zombies in this zombie movie, though, it has a lot going for it. The film quality, acting, make-up, effects, and soundtrack are all really good. If you can get over the disappointment of the missing zombies (I couldn't), it's an entertaining watch."
3,Interesting but average overall,"Trailer Park of Terror is the story of essentially a haunted trailer park. Several things to consider before making your decision on this one. First, the humor is very trailer park-centric; if red necks and that culture's associated humor grates your nerves more than make you laugh, avoid this movie. Second, the production values are surprisingly good; high quality camera footage, good sets, good F/X, etc. The part, though, that makes this movie overall very average is the story. The movie overall is interesting, but not compelling; there really isn't that extra something to make this film stand out. I do have to say that the setting in a trailer park is amusing, but that's not enough for me (the red neck thing doesn't work for me), but it could well be the deciding factor that makes this movie work for others."
3,Good Zombie fun!,"This was funny and gorey. Not that scarey, but well done for a straight to DVD horror movie. Definitely better than others I have seen. It's somewhat like Rest Stop meets Devil's Rejects, but it's really a unique horror movie all its own. Nichole Hiltz is genius and really should have had more screen time. The movie starts to drag a little towards the end, which probably isn't good since it's only 91 minutes long. If you're not expecting a fine cinematic experience and like funny, bloody zombie horror movies, give this a shot. Good, fun rental!"
3,trashy as they cum!,"I rented this and will be buying it very soon make sure u see the unrated version. highly original and the special effects are just as awesome as the acting.Priscilla Barnes(Devils Rejects Three's Company) has a great part.Worth the money and based on a comic book ,surprising because it was well done,Trace Adkins has a small role as well, just in time for Halloween."
4,Great horror/comedy movie. Not for the squeemish.,"Although I was disappointed that Trace Adkins only played a bit part, I was satisfied with the overall plot of the movie. Just enough comedy to nicely balance the horror and make the movie interesting. I'm sure this will become one of the classic movies everyone wants to see in the future."
2,To be missed,"As the vast majority of the stories that are presented in 'Secret Life' are not associated with Vandermeer's fictional city, Ambergris, I had hoped that my enjoyment of them would have been significantly higher than that I experienced while reading 'City of Saints and Madmen.'Sadly, this was not the case.Don't get me wrong; Vandermeer is a very good writer; however, he often appears to get so caught up in the telling of a story - making sure that the descriptions are unique and that everything ties together - that the story often doesn't actually GO anywhere.I tend to read right before I go to bed, and it's never a good sign for a book when I find myself falling asleep and having to reread the same passages over and over, trying to get some semblance of why I should care.Vandermeer's efforts as an editor seem to far surpass his efforts at his own fiction."
4,"Personal History, Great Art","This book is the smaller, 85-page ""personal experience"" book of artist/writer/historian Ramseur. It is the ""kernel"", the ""core history"" out of which grew the 265-page book ""HAUNTED PALACE"", which has historic photos, ex-patient and ex-staff interviews and contrubutions of poetry, memoirs, etc from dozens of others. Both books are beautiful and full of Ramseur's own art. The original book, EYE OF DANVERS, is an extraordinary gem which must be appreciated as the little art masterpiece that it is."
5,Easy to Learn - Tons of Fun!,"I got this book for my 10yo daughter for Christmas. We tried the basic wrap as our first test and I am amazed at how simple it was and how great it came out looking for the first try. My daughter said her friend has a machine but this book allows you to learn how to make patterns like a woven wrap, spiral wrap and rope wraps. I don't think you can get those looks from the machine. It's also nice to sit and work on with her for the 15 minutes it takes to wrap. I'm excited to try more styles with her in the coming weeks."
3,Hair Wraps,"Hair Wraps. This is a great kit for girls to learn to wrap hair, but if you're a grown up and you want to do it, it's very hard, especially if you have problems with your hands and doing small things. I think it's great for teen girls."
3,the fear,"the dvd arrived in about a week in mint condition. however, this is possibly the worst movie ever made!"
5,The Fear is the best,Bought The Fear and it was an awesome movie. It is a timeless movie that you will enjoy every time you watch it.
1,poor,"This movie is just bad. It's totally cheesy and unrealistic, obviously targeted on dimwitted teens. Horrible acting of stud-muffin ""rap"" artist formerly known as Marky Mark is the worst thing about it."
3,RENT THE MUCH BETTER SEQUEL. THIS ONE PALES IN COMPARISON.,"Come on, both of these ""Fear"" movies are essentially cheesy fun horror flicks. They're meant to be watched with a group of buddies on a Friday night over pizza and beers. But seriously, this one isn't all that fun. It tries to be something it's not and it can be a little annoying at times. Only redeeming factor in this one. . .NUDITY. There's lots of nude chicks in this flick. That's the one element that's missing from the TERRIFICLY LAME sequel."
1,Hardly worth reviewing,"Terrible excuse for a horror movie. Wooden mannequin ""Morty"" isn't scary at all. A waste of time."
1,Both DVD Versions are Censored,"I am a huge fan of this movie and bought it on VHS a long time ago. Recently I purchased a used copy of the Simitar Edition of The Fear on ebay, when I started watching the first thing I noticed was that the transfer was horrible with pixilization very obvious and also artifacts throught the film were also very obvious, and then the biggest problem, it was censored. I don't mean just the nudity, all of the language, etc. was edited. So I then bought the A-Pix DVD, hopeing for a better DVD. Instead I found that it was the same exact dvd, only with a different logo on it. My advice is to buy the VHS edition. It actually has a better picture than the DVD and it is not edited. Hope I help you in your purchase."
1,This DVD is ...,"...TOTALLY CENSORED!!! Be sure to stay away from this version unless you liked your movies minus the nudity, violence and adult language. I could not believe what they did to this film. I felt like I was watching it on network TV. I know that it says that it is rated R but trust me it is not. The VHS might be a different story but I would not know since I am stuck with this hacked up Unapix version. I repeat this is the Unapix DVD not the Simitar. I think that the Simtar release has been discontinued for some time."
2,MORTY THE MANNEQUIN,"THE FEAR gives us a psychology student who decides to gather some friends for a weekend getaway and discuss and analyze what they are afraid of. A subplot involves a campus rapist who just might be one of the weekend party. Also included is a wooden mannequin named Morty who supposedly has special magical powers. The late Vince Edwards (Ben Casey) made his last appearance in this yawner. The cast is uniformly bad, and the editing, pacing and coherency of script leave a lot to be desired. Morty is about as believable as the Easter Bunny and the movie's fright ratio non-existent."
1,Spyder Conquest jacket,"My order was received approx. 2 weeks after I ordered it and the jacket was a size 12, not the size 10 I ordered. When I called the customer service number listed, they stated that they were too busy at that time and to please call back at another time. (I was speaking to a live person.) When I called back at a later date, I was informed that they no longer had any size 10 jackets left, nor did they have a size 8 which I would have accepted as well. I ended up just returning the jacket and now have to start shopping again 4 weeks later."
3,Shrinks when washed,"I ordered the lilac and pink pair of socks. I primarily purchased them for the length; I am always cold and knee socks keep me warm. They are thick and there is an extra bit of padding in the feet and toes, which I appreciate because I seem to always get a hole in the toe of my socks.I washed these in cold water and line dried and they shrunk significantly. They are no longer knee socks, but mid-calf socks. I feel that for the price I paid for these, they should have not shrunk so badly on the first washing."
1,The incredible shrinking sock.,"These socks have only been washed in cold water, never put in the dryer and after 2 washings are 1/2 the size! I emailed the company to complain about this, and about the fact that most of my order was missing. You know what they had to say? Nothing. No reply. I attempted several e-mails and aparently they couldn't be bothered to respond. My wife can still fit into the socks, but they certainly aren't knee socks. She wanted knee socks and ended up dissapointed. Can you give 0 stars?"
2,Not the best sock,"I got these socks last year and they haven't held up very well. A few of them alreayd have holes and some of them don't really fit equally. They are all the same size so I don't get that. They are warm and thick certainly, but the hole in a few are just not good at all. I already have to throw away a few pairs! And I don't ride, I just wear them doing every day tasks so yo would expect a bit more wear in a riding sock."
3,High Socks,I liked the socks but they had writing on the calf that was not visible in the picture. This writing takes away from the socks because the writing is big.
2,"They are argyle knee high socks, I guess","Seemed a little like hose..., too thin.I wore them once and already some of the stitching is coming out.Look closely before you buy.The pattern ends pretty high on the low calf.The logo is huge and stretches around your whole leg.i wouldn't buy again."
1,Awful. It doesn't work and the company service is terrible.,"I bought this MP3 player about two months ago. Although it worked fine for the first month or so, I've been experiencing problems ever since. None of my buttons function correctly and the thing actually seems possessed at times. On the rare occasion that I actually get it to play songs, it will simply go haywire at random. In the middle of a song, it will begin switching back and forth from radio to mp3 and there's nothing I can do to stop it. I've tried getting information off of the company's website, but it's just awful. I cannot think of a product with which I am less satisfied. If I hadn't spent so much money on it, I would have smashed it into pieces already. Believe me, if I can figure out a way to get my money back, I will. Save yourself the trouble, do what I should have done and buy an IPod or some other reliable product from a reputable dealer. Good luck."
1,An Awful Product - Avoid At All Costs,This is an absolutely dreadful product. It doesn't play well with Windows and you'll be lucky if you EVER get a response from Technical Support. Have been trying for weeks to get this to work and am about to throw it in the trash and write it off as a learning experience.
5,sweet creepy crawlies,"When I first listened to this CD I imagined it to be the soundtrack to some kind of faerie movie. Then I learned that Microcosmos is actually about bugs... The music is very mysterious, a bit eerie and yet very sweet. This music will persuade even the most decidated fly swatter to love our crawling little friends :)"
4,fine Spanish guitar album,"I wouldnt call this a romantic album, but I've bought worse(many much worse) and a few better Spanish/Latin jazz/guitars albums than this one. It's a mix of this and that; a hit and miss album. Thus, for $5, it's a good value."
3,"Fits, but looser and lower quality than the Spicer equivalent.","I've installed a lot of driveshafts and j-joints over the years. I have always used Spicer parts whenever possible. They made the axles and the yokes, I use their joints too. So it stands to reason that their parts should be of the best fitment and quality. It just so happens that this time, the Spicer parts I needed for our Jeep weren't available, so I figured, ""Well, AC Delco has always been a good brand, and I haven't had any BAD luck with their parts"". So, I bought these. When I put these on, they were flush with the yoke ears before even tightening the bolts. I guarantee they will loosen up after this vehicle is driven, resulting in yoke wear or premature j-joint failure. When you use the Spicer parts, they have about 1/16"" space between the yoke and the strap before tightening, which pulls the strap down and stretches it for a guaranteed tight fit."
3,SKleefeld's Assesment,"Comics File Magazine had printed this tribute to the Fantastic Four just as John Byrne was leaving the title. This book-format magzine provides interviews on what was then the future of the series, as well as tidbits and trivia on the FF. While much of the material is now irrelevant several years later, it still provides some insight on some of the ideas that went into the stories around issue #300"
5,Built for Comfort,"I had pleasure to listen Built for Comfort, along with ""...blue"" and ""...Locomotive"" CD's. I found this CD, to be his (R. Lucas)best so far. Although, ""Luke and the Locomotives"" is his accepted ""flagship"" album...and graded as one of Best blues albums ever, in ""...Comfort"" he did a bit different.For example, he introduces tube as replacement for bass guitar, in couple of songs you should check: ""Built for comfort, and ""Blues Man from LA"". As i am favor classical over any other music, i was pleased to see somebody take a chance, and make wave, instead of the luke-warm splash as is case the with most recent ""blockbusters"" Sound is superb as with all ""audioquest"" recordings. This is a MUST have cd, for true music lover, regardless of taste!"
3,Not Very Well Built,"After loving every minute of two other Lucas albums, ""Luke and the Locomotives"" and ""Completely Blue"", this one was a major disappointment. Don't take me wrong: It is a good album. But if you want to listen to Lucas on his best, something I thing everyone should do, then go for the albums mentioned above (try the JVC XRCD edition of ""Luke and the Locomotives"" - it's hot!)."
5,Great Drill,Got a great price on a Goldbox Deal. I have used this many times and ithas taken care of each task performed. Some one came to install a storm door at my house and his Dewalt drill had no power. He used mine and stated it was a great drill and finished the job easily
1,its a piece,"Like the other guy said, dont drop it. I dropped mine from about 12ft. and it in pieces. This drill is made for homeowners. It doesnt stand a chance in the real world."
3,Incorrect Information,"I've ordered several of these drills, and they all were received with only one battery. The information on the website state 2 were included. This is an inconvenience more than anything, and I'll need to research the costs of additional batteries now, or figure out through Amazon how to get corrected. I can't provide any evidence to the reliability of the unit at this time."
2,Not bad for a homeowner,"I owned this piece for about 4 months. I tend to do heavyer work then the average home owner, but needed a cordless drill with a 1/2"" chuck for my 3/4"" wood augger bit to drill through studwork on an addition I was building. It works fine when drilling through 1 2X4, and even 2. I was a bit supprised that when I was drilling through 3 boards that the drill didn't stop, but catch fire. Most every other tool that has an electric motor has a thermal override that would cut off if the motor got hot, but this didnt. I only paid $70 for it, and feel that is all it is worth. If you want power that is not comprimised by un-intelegence in manufacturing then go with a Dewalt."
3,Good drill,"I like this drill because it feels great in my hand and is very comfortable to use. The grip is great. I hate the keyless chuck. On certain bits, I just can't seem to get the chuck tight and it will come loose during the job. I have dewalt drills that don't have this problem. The batteries with this drill are horrible. They don't last long at all. Hitachi makes a another battery that fits this drill that last a lot longer. Overall a decent drill."
1,A Waste of Money,"Purchased this product in May of 2009 for basic residential use. The drill's chuck is very inferior and it takes multiple efforts to align drill bits. When drilling, the chuck often loses its grip and the bit just slips. The latest fiasco is the drill's inability to hold the power pack which simply falls out of the drill and crashes to the floor. Very disappointed with the quality of this product and would not recommend to anyone seeking a basic drill. The flashlight is the best thing about this kit."
4,Hitachi cordless drill,"This is a great cordless drill. I have other tools made by Hitachi and they are great too. Don't hesitate to buy Hitachi tools. And don't forget, Amazon.com has the best prices. Thank you."
4,nice drill,"this was an upgrade to my old 13.2 volt firestorm which died recently. Definatly can tell the extra torque, and the speed of recharge is great too. The included light really comes in handy too, and it's BRIGHT! I named mine Drillzilla because the colors remind me of Godzilla"
2,Light broke within 30 days and one battery died within one year,"The drill is great but now that I've lost the light (it broke within a month) and the spare battery, it's not such a good deal. A spare battery runs $60-$80 and the light - well, that's just a throwaway. So the question is, ""Do I spend the $60-$80 to replace the battery or do I spend $100-$150 to buy a different power drill?"" I'm not sure at this point. I'm expecting the battery that is working will die soon too which means it's really $120-$160 to replace both batteries in two years. I'd rather just buy a new Dewalt or something else and take my chances. There. I just talked myself into buying a different drill."
3,Good price on older cordless kit,I purchased this item to complement an older Hitachi 18-Volt tool kit. Both kits use the same model of battery and charger. Replacement batteries for old tools cost almost as much as a new tool.
5,Met all of my expectations...great product!,Met all of my expectations...great product! I use this drill almost daily and I love it! I will likely buy more just like this in the future.
4,exellent choice,This is my second purchase of Hitachi cordless drills and they do a great job. I recommend them. My Hitachi power saw is the best I've ever used.
4,Great DIY Tool,"I have had this cordless drill/flashlight kit for over a year. Keep the batteries charged. If they sit for a long period of time, they will loose capacity. Not the manufacturer's fault, just the nature of Ni-Cad batteries. Good torque, clutch works well, I'm very pleased. Honestly, I probably use the flashlight more than the drill."
1,CRAP DONT BUY LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE,"I bought 3 Crap-tachi drills that came with 6 batteries. After a year and a half 5 of the batteries have gone bad. You think you got this great warranty with it you don't its a joke read the fine print, it only covers the drill it self, so what do you do with a drill with no batteries? I called the customer service line its even worst, The customer service agent told me I should have bough a Makita instead and I would have not had this problem. So I went down to there repair center and talked to the guy about it, he says the all this Hitachi stuff is junk, and they have nothing but problems with it. [...]"
2,Hitachi is the brand name (suppose Japan made) but total made in China,"I have used Makita (12.2 v) for years. I dropped on floor from above 4 ft. and I have never have any problem. Now my batteries dead, so I got Hitachi(14.4v) by yesterday (Father's day) at Lowe's. I paid for $99 with bonus card' lowe's $25 = I paid total $74 +tax. good price I have seen before ($149).But it was made by China. I had DVD, camcorder, TV, lap with batteries bad very soon (all China made). So I returned this drill and get Dewalt (14.4 V) $99 + tax (was $149). A man works for Lowe's he referred me to get Dewalt. See how much value Dewalt can give you. I trust men gave review about Dewalt 14.4v.Think twive before get any power tool which use cordless( batt) which was made China."
3,HappyGirl,"Well, I bought this book to help me pass my class (which I did). I believe that you must have a foundation of Organic Chemistry and I did not. Which is why I think this book did not help me. I was expecting it to be more in detailed and step by step which it is not. Maybe I should have bought the General Chemistry for dummies first."
4,Exactly as it described.,The product description online was exactly as it came. Although i did regular shipping it came in 2 days. Very happy with the entire process.
4,Organic Chemistry for Dummies,"Considering Organic Chemistry is probably one of the toughest subjects to dumb down, this book does an awesome job at it! I really found it to be very helpful when I needed additional help over something my professor hadn't cleared up so well in lecture. I have recommended this book to many of my fellow classmates and will continue to do so."
4,Great for College Students,"This book is great if you are a pre-professional health science major and need to learn the inner workings of Organic Chemistry. It gives you some insight before you take the class on how to succeed in studying in it, so you can make that ""A"" that your admissions board will be proud to see on your transcript. I highly recommend it."
3,Pretty Good,"This book does simplify some important concepts in Organic Chemistry, but it does not cover everything you may need. For example, when naming compounds, the book explains in detail how to name skeletal structures, but it left out some important rules for naming cyclic compounds. It will not clarify everything, but it should still help if you are lost."
4,Good!,"Good, Great product! I recommend it!Nice timing, great price, perfect for students budget. I do not regret my purchase"
3,Oh...Organic,"Yeah...Organic Chemistry is just one of those subjects...If you don't know it or can't get it...you probably won't. And no book or prayer can help very much. (Could just be me!) But the book does a good job of breaking it down and making it less like rocket science. If you need a bit of help, this will work for you."
5,Great supplement,"I found the book great for rounding out the fuzzy edges of understanding organic chemistry. Simply written in a visual manner. Although my textbook was not organized in the same manner, the table of contents made it easy to follow along."
3,Pretty good.,"The book is helpful, but like most in the ""for dummies"" series, it just doesn't present ENOUGH. I'd been out of school for a few years, and was really looking for something supplemental outside of class. This book, what there is of it, does help, but there isn't nearly enough of it. In their effort to shorten it to make it seem less of a textbook, it left me feeling rushed, and lacking something; especially at test time. More examples, problems and solutions, and descriptions would have been great."
4,organic chem review,"its a good tool. a great companion to any organich chemistry textbook. dont expect to understand it, unless you are taking or have taken an organic chem. class in my opinion. breaks down the basics well, but i didnt think had enough examples to solidify the point."
2,Not a help,"I bought this book thinking it might be helpful over the course of my Orgo I class, however, this book turned out to be way tooooo Basic to be of any help at all. I also thought that the order and ways which the reactions and concepts were not done well at all. Poor coverage of electrophilic addition."
2,There are better supplement books...,"Needing a supplement to my Organic Chemistry textbook I picked this up, which was more or less a waste. It simply doesn't provide enough to better understand college level Organic Chemistry, maybe High School. It read and felt like a dumbed down bad textbook, with bad attempts at humor thrown in; maybe to dull up the reading. Don't get me wrong there are helpful parts of the book... just few and far between. After my disappointment I picked up Organic Chemistry Demystified, a definite college/grad level supplement which was very good, and the quizzes helped immensly."
4,"Amusing to read, can be helpful","This really can be quite a helpful book, if you actually take the time to read it. Its written in a way to be pretty amusing, and explains things pretty well."
4,Pretty good.,I found this very helpful for many of the topics in my course when I didn't know what the heck my textbook was taking about. I am however very surprised by how something published for mainly college students has so many obvious typos. All they needed to do was a read through to catch most of them. So that's why its a 4 and not a 5.
3,Never held my interest,"Madeline's former fiance, now a Jesuit brother, hires Mad Bean Events to set up a breakfast for the Pope. But after they find what looks like a murder confession in an old Jesuit cookbook, dead bodies start to accumulate.Okay but dragging by the time I got halfway through so I skipped to the end. There was nothing terribly wrong with this series but the stories never held my attention and the characters never seemed real. There were a couple biting/funny Hollywood comments, though, and the title was somewhat related to the story."
4,Buen complemento para mi Nikon. Muy util,Me sirve mucho para usar mejor mi Nikon D70. El material es bueno y encaja perfectamente en el visor de la cámara.
5,Great price - works great on Nikon D5100! AAA++++,Best replacement for the money! Same quality as orginal equipment. I bought two to keep a spare handy just in case.
1,doesn't work,"This product was not as described - the ""wax"" is very stiff and doesn't press into gauges. The coloured pens only come in 2 colours and do not match my dark wood cabinets. All in all not a great product and I do not recommend it."
3,Pretty Good!!,Finishing markers worked good for hairline and semi-deeper scratches. I would recommend this product for hardwood floor use.
1,DOES NOT WORK!!!!,"This repair kit simply does not work! I have blonde wood in my dining room and dark (cherry and walnut) in my living room. Both have small/thin scratches and larger gouges. I tried the wax stick on the larger but it would not stick to the wood! I did it right and followed the instructions, but the wax just flaked off. The shape of the stick wont even let you get into the scratch. I had to push hard to even transfer the slightest amount onto the wood. What did stay, left a shiny noticeable residue but not on the scratch. The markers seemed almost dried out and did not help. You will not like this! Old English scratch cover workes WAY better!"
5,BIC Comfort Twin Blade Razor with Lube Strip for men,"The other three 5 star ratings are right on, I couldn't agree more. Just like them, I'm at Amazon because the local vendors no longer stock this item. Amazon, keep up the good work!"
1,cheap razors that I wouldn't take if they were given away free,I don't recommend these razors and I am not happy that I bought them.
5,My Favorite Blade,"After using this product for a while, suddenly I can't find it at any of my nearby drug stores, so I have to order it from Amazon. It gives me a clean close shave without any razor burn. If you must shave, try this blade. I think you'll find it a great value for the money."
1,Bic Comfort Twin Blade Razor with Lube Strip.,Best disposable razor that I have ever use. Smooth clean shave every time.
5,FA 18,"Thanks for the great service and for providing me with a superior product. I am impressed that at a busy time of year service remained out standing, thanks again, peace"
5,a truly great early study of Vietnam,"""a truly great early study of Vietnam"" is what I said in my first review; the two stars were for the publisher - as we now have access to the battle area and actual NVA participants. In the spirit of Were Were Soldiers Once.. I'd have wished for more....but I do realize that spending weeks in Vietnam was infeasible.. JMK"
2,Regret,"Ever read a newspaper article to find half of it is taken up by useless information? e.g. ""Dr Kenith E. Browner (MBA, BAS, winner of the 2002 SoandSo award, local Environmentalist, Graduated from Northern SS University with honors) says to bundle up this weekend."" ... You just can't help to skim past it all.. Which brings me to Death Valley by Keith William Nolan. Half of this book is filled with useless info! Once in a while you get a little hint of a story, but then it jumps back into naming so many battalions, sergeants, lieutenants, soldiers, weapons, equipment, points...etc You just can't visualize anything happening with all of this... well.... I don't know what it is. One thing I'm sure of is that I totally regret setting eyes on this book"
5,Excellent!!,Great book! It sits right next to my easel! Full of information about color and value - very informative and useful!
4,Helen Van Wyk's Favorite Color Recieps,I have not had enough time to give a very detailed review on this book 'however from what I have read I am very impressed with the clarity in her descriptions on mixing colors and their use.
3,as described,"The crate tray is as described. I mean it doesn't go above and beyond and it isn't exactlly the perfect fit to the kennel I needed it for, but hey thats why we use Amazon. It works for what i need it for. so thanks again."
3,Good yet wrong!,"The advertisement read that it was 36L x 24W and was a direct replacement from the manufacturers model that came with the crate. However, after taking it out of the packaging and trying to put it in the crate, I quickly realized it was too big. The difference I saw between the this and the original pan were the edges. This one was thicker and caused problems. I forced it in with a lot of effort and it doesn't sit flat in one corner but I think with a trimming of the plastic I'll make it fit right."
4,Also fits the ancient Model 61,"I bought this pan as a replacement for the metal pan in an ancient (17 years) Midwest Model 61 folding crate. The original pan is still in good condition, but I wanted the lighter ABS pan to make the crate easier to carry to training and trials. This is mostly to let anyone else using the Model 61 crate that this replacement pan will work. It is slightly narrower than the metal pan, but not enough to be dangerously loose. Put a piece of cardboard in between the crate and the pan for longer pan life."
5,purchaser,I love it. Durable and sturdy not flimsy at all. I didn't think that it was going to fit but it fits like a glove. I'm really glad I got it.
5,dog crate replacement pan,We almost bought a new dog crate because our pan was very cracked after almost 3 years with our lab. The replacement pan is excellent and saved us from buying a whole new crate.
3,probably great for calm dog,"This product was for a 48"" cage. My dog is a big dog and not real happy about being crated. She tore this up in two days. I should have bought a metal one. It would be great for a calm dog."
2,Product arrived with crack in one corner.,First off the tray appears very similar to the original that came with the Lifestages crate which I purchased. There are a couple of exceptions:Pros:- The tray appears thicker than the Life stages which last approx. 3 years with a 70lb. English Bulldog.Cons:- The packaging appears to have been inadequate for the product and one of the corners has cracked and is not repairable.Overall I was optimistic regarding this purchase however given the damage likely caused by shipping I am uncertain if I will be able to use the tray.
1,"Flimsy, junky, cracks easily",This item is such a flimsy piece of garbage. It bends and flexes easily and cracks with minimal effort. My pit bull ripped one to shreds. If anyone knows where to buy a metal crate pan please let me know.
1,Terrible customer service will NEVER order from this company AGAIN,"I get the incorrect pan and contact them to get a refund and they want me to pay to send it back..I come onto Amazon.com and leave a fairly poor review and they email me back saying they will pay to ship the old and new pan back if I remove my feed back and rating before the send me anything (they don't want to get scammed). So I do, and here it is a week later and I still have not received an email from them for the UPS shipping label. So I have contacted Amazon and have filed a claim with their customer service to file a claim to get the product back to the seller and my refund."
3,destructive dog,"The MidWest Replacement Pan was of very good quality - much sturdier than the original tray(which was not a MidWest product). Unfortunately, my 7 month old Sammy managed to chew the end off the tray and then proceeded to split it up the middle. So until he outgrows his chewing ways he has a piece of plywood covered by ceremic tile instead of a tray in his kennel!"
5,Easy order - verything in order,I would buy again. Fast delivery. Customer service response to an email was delayed but all was in order so no issue.
5,"MidWest Folding Dog Crate Replacement Pan 36""",I needed a new replacement tray for my dog crate as the previous one was very thin and fell apart. It was a better quality and arrived promptly for my new puppy.
3,Replacement Dog Crate pan,The pan does not fit the crate out of the box. You have to cut off the curled lip on both sides of the long length in order to slide it in.
4,Crate Pan...,"This crate pan was a little larger than the factory/initial pan that came with my crate. That being said, it has held up really well, and seems to be a higher quality item."
4,replacement part,It was bought to replace a broken one that came with the cage we got. Its sturdy and it looks just like the one it came with.
4,Catahoula who tap dances in her cage...,"I've got a year old catahoula who has to be crated while I'm at work. She's a digger and like to dig at the bottom of the cage as well as ""tap dance"" which eventually causes the bottom to crack, then she eats the pan. haha... So it's nice to be able to get one from here since you can't find them locally anywhere!"
5,It's magnificent.It brings back all the good memories.,"All the tracks I love happened to be on this album.Also I will be grateful if you can help me know the artist of these songs;ELECTRIC BOOGIE,LAST NIGHT DJ SAVE MY LIFE."
4,Couldn't be nicer,Jim Brickman plays piano the way every kid's music teacher dreams they will play. Those kids probably think it is boring until they watch this video. Brickman displays the most relaxed approach to piano playing that I have seen in video. He truly enjoys himself. The appearances of Donny Osmond and Olivia Netwon John on this video make it even more pleasurable. This is the kind of show you can watch over and over again because it is delightful both on the eyes and ears. This is one I would add to the collection.
3,Nice DVD!,"I specifically bought this DVD because Donny Osmond and Olivia Newton John are on it. (I am a huge fan of both Donny and Olivia.) Jim Brickman is also very talented but I don't know enough about him to make a fair judgement. I did watch the whole DVD and I enjoyed it though. I would say that if you enjoy Jim Brickman and piano music, which I do like, you will enjoy this DVD."
3,"Neat knife, but NOT a Shun.","Ok, firstly, I'd like to say that this is a very cool-looking, quality knife. Compared to the other folding steak knives out there, this might be the neatest one I've seen.That being said, this is NOT a Shun knife. The first thing you'll realize upon unfolding it is ""Made in USA"" in big letters on the side of the blade. Normally, seeing that is a big plus in my opinion; But not on a blade I'm expecting to be a Shun.The fact is this is a rebranded Kershaw folding knife. Given, Kershaw makes a nice blade, but it still won't hold a candle to your real Shuns. It seems that Amazon's listing makes care to not mention that it wasn't made in Japan, in the hopes that Shun lovers will assume the same quality and buy it without seeing it first.So, in short, it's a neat knife, but don't expect it to be a Shun. It isn't."
3,Misrepresentation,"This is a great knife. Lock back works and cuts like butter, however, it did not arrive with the protective leather sheath as advertised. The box is allright, but hardley ""portable,"" so this almost makes it useless as the intended use was to put in my pocket & take it to a restaurant... without a safety latch system or ""protective sheath"" to keep it closed, it could come open in my pocket and stab me (like butter). Not completely happy with this Christmas gift."
2,should've shopped around,Wow...payed $100.00 for the small version of this knife....could've gotten the larger version for the same price had I not been so lazy and walked into Williams and Sonoma...
4,Useful Book,"I find this book very insightful and impressively exhaustive. The two people who have read it in my household have learned a lot. It contains many, many, exercsies, but you don't have to do all of them... It's the sort of book that you can pick up and open at random."
1,Not a very good book,"This is an odd book that gives examples of people acting in anger, and filled with ""written"" exercises that one must do. It is poorly written and needs updating. I do not recommend it!"
3,Marred by poor sound and picture quality,"FIve years ago I would not have complained a bit about the sound and picture quality of this show but now with the standards being so high for everything, this appears poor in comparison.Yes, the sound is mono and the picture is blurred and grainy, but no more that a VHS release. It still looks good and sounds OK. The band is really swinging and having a lot of fun up there on the stage.I have a VHS copy of a UK performance which was made 20 years ago and is almost as good as this DVD release, but which company will pay the money to get it cleaned up and re-released?My major problem with this DVD is the lack of extras. You get a (static) menu, a photo gallery (4 pictures from the show - isn't that what pause is for?) and a discography.But all that said, for a budged DVD, it'll have the joint jumpin' and is well worth adding to your collection."
4,Primarily for completists,"Many fans who already own the VHS version of this concert may be delighted as I was by the inclusion of several new songs. The real gem among these is a terrific version of ""Say Hey"" by the incredibly energetic Andy Hernandez--a true funk classic which alone makes this DVD worth the purchase."
1,AM radio sounds better than this,This audio track on the DVD is mono. The audio quality is not much better than that of a cheap clock radio. Video is 4:3 (non-widescreen)Don't pay more than $6 for this.
5,The Pirates of Penzance (Gilbert & Sullivan),"Sir Malcolm Sargent, ConductorGlyndebourne Festival Chorus (chorus Master Peter Gellhorn)Pro Arte Orchestracopyright 1961, digital remastering 1987George Baker as Major-General StanleyJames Milligan as the Pirate KingJohn Cameron as SamuelRichard Lewis as FredericOwen Brannigan as Sergeant of PoliceElsie Morison as MabelHeather Harper as EdithMajorie Thomas as KateMonica Sinclair as Ruth2 Discs. Second disc has bonus tracks: overture for ""the Sorcerer"", overture of ""Cox and Box"", overture for ""Princess Ida"", ""Sullivan: Overture in C 'In Memoriam'"""
1,MJB,"This is just old, I mean VERY OLD, tv blooper shows joined together. My friends and I watching were not familiar with any of the ""stars"" mentioned they were so old. I'm not sure of the dates, but looks like 60's and 70's teams and players. The basketball shorts are short-shorts. The sports sequence opening the DVD shows soccer among the types of sports bloopers; however, there are no other soccer segments. To be fair, soccer is not listed on the menu at the beginning."
5,You should read this book with a box of Kleenex,"Our high school put onn this deeply moveing and emotional play. The story of 5 nurses, a singer, and a man goes from the present to the past and back again. No one wins in Veitanm and in a way, everyone dies. The man symbolizes everything bad, and the women, the human side of an inhumane war."
2,"Not bad for some, but bias is evident","Not a bad overview of educational psychology, with plenty of resources for existing teachers to use in their instruction. As such, the title of this book would more properly be ""Educational Psychology for Teachers"". For psychologists and educational psychologists, it is rather inadequate, missing many of the new ideas in educational psychology that have not yet reached the ""mainstream"" of teaching, where Woolfolk resides. Most distressingly, her adherence to traditional ideas in education is annoyingly pervasive and interferes with the reader's process of inquiry and the formation of their own conclusions. As an educator herself, Woolfolk should know better that this."
1,"Professor, do some research","The author's bias is too strong for an introductory text book in Educational Psychology. I almost signed up for a graduate class in which this book was assigned. Fortunately, I read several chapters in the bookstore and did not register!Ed Psych is an area of education where important developments are emerging. This book and presumably the author are stuck in the dark ages of behaviorism and rationales like ""Because I'm the teacher that's why."" Or perhaps the more glaring deduction is that Woolfolk's books are her cash cows.... Then, bully for her and shame on the professors who continue to teach with this tripe."
4,great coverage of WWII planes,"I am 14 years old and i think that these movies are great. They cover lots of WWII planes including, P-38 Zero and the ""Superfortress"" Great movies about different air battles."
4,good movie.,"These movie is all about the air war in WWII. It covers all sorts of planes Including the P-38, Zero and the ""Superfortress"" This movie is good gift for people who like vintage planes or are just interested in the air war in WWII i enjoyed these movies. ...."
2,Read Memories of a Catholic Girlhood instead,"I love most of Mary McCarthy, but in my opinion, this is her weakest book. It covers basically the same territory as Memories of a Catholic Girlhood, which she wrote in the 1950s. Here, however, there's little trace of her signature, tightly-wrought style. Instead, the style is baggy, with convoluted sentences, chatty asides, digressions within digressions, and endless lists of books she read, names of friends, etc. As a result, I often lost track of the basic story - which, after all, was the exact same story she had already told in Memories of a Catholic Girlhood. I'm rather confused as to why McCarthy wrote this book at all. Given that she had already written a detailed memoir of her formative years, why not just skip ahead to the mid-1930s, the subject of her unfinished ""Intellectual Memoirs""?"
2,Boring,"This is one of the most boring books I've ever read. The attempt to mix the author's life (her mother's dementia) with one of her interests (Art at The Hermitage) is a debacle. Sometimes, two totally different things compliment each other: vinegar and oil. In this case, they do not. This was contrived and unnecessary . The endless effort to seem intellectual, and the author's decision to bring the outcome in the middle of the book are two of the many things that spelled disaster. I do not recommend this book."
4,Madonna,"Sometimes the story was a little hard to follow, even though it is a quick and easy read.Good story."
4,"Bawdy, clever and pretty damn funny","I got this to reread it after another 20 years. Its just as funny as I remember and find a good balance between tender hearted sentiment and a ridiculous, bawdy free for all. One of Donleavy's best, and a fun place to spend a couple of days."
2,Studio Apartments?,"I found this book to present interesting but completely unrealistic solutions for the average studio apartment dweller. First of all, most the apartment spaces were at least 800 square-feet, much larger than most studios I've ever seen. They also assume that everyone has the liberty and means to knock down and/or build walls, refinish floors, and divide the space into actual separate rooms. I did like that the designers presented the floor plans for all the apartments, thus showing that they were actually full-fledged one or even two bedroom apartments. My perception of a studio apartment is a one-room living space, not the glitzy spaces pictured in this book with penthouse views, loft space for days and state of the art kitchens and baths. This book is the equivalent of browsing through Architectural Digest, looking at fancy rooms that are far beyond your budget and are but an unattainable dream."
2,I should have read the editorial review closely.,"This is not a book for the average apartment dweller looking for inspiration to decorate within the boundaries of a studio apartment. It is only for architects and designers who have the ability to manipulate their environment by changing the structure of the confined space. It certainly wasn't meant for the average, Ikea joe who needed advice on making the most out of a small situation. I wish I could find an apartment that looked like these, only the rich could afford what was pictured."
3,"Beautiful, but completely impractical",Those who can afford to remodel their studio condominiums to look like those shown in this book can certainly afford to buy bigger homes in the first place!
5,Inspirational,Excellent combinations of photos and drawings to show off the features of these fantastic units. Before and after plans illustrate how design potentials can be optimized and achieved...
5,A Lifetime of Collected Wisdom,"I think the author is on a par with Sun Tzu, Miyamoto, and the other authors in the world on the topic. I think it is unfair to simply compare him to Machiavelli alone or to dismiss the work as being cynical. In politics and business, one must deal with both good people and bad. What kind of advice would it be if it only addressed dealing with good people. Sometimes one deals with tyrants and greedy people and good people need ethical ways of survival. Maxims and Reflections provides that."
5,Delbert's best work yet!,"With this CD, Delbert McClinton proves that he can pen lyrics just as well as he can belt out the blues. So many cuts are destined to be classics: ""When Rita Leaves,"" ""Living it up,"" ""Watching the Rain"" ... great stuff. Truly, this is music, as they say in Gruene, ""too good for the radio."""
5,Another Homerun,"I am biased of course towards Delbert. I have all his recordings and find he never leaves me lacking. He is the one person I can turn folks on to and they never leave disappointed! Delbert's live performances and his Blues Cruise are the ulitimate in rock and roll for anyone to see. If you like to dance and pass a good time the Cruise is a must! As usual Delbert, like Jimmy Hall, and Al Anderson are out on the fringe due to the lack of cajones present in today's radio format. It is no wonder the good music today is out on the fringe. That is one thing about Texas, they put out some good musicians and singers."
2,Delbert Did it Again!,Imus steered me in the right direction. I am a big Delbert fan and this CD is one more fantastic work by a great artist. Looking for more from Delbert!
1,WOOFY SOCIOLOGIST RAMBLINGS,"This book is about ten good pages and the remainder is a stream of rambling woofy ideas with very little to hold it together.Beyond the first chapter, the content varies from the social impact of social sacrifice to how the Greek philopshers would rate modern thoughts on mass consumption.It has very little to do with WHY people would go to a supermarket and HOW they act while they are there - nothing on causality, just lots of words joined together.Be careful about buying this book. It's a waste of space as far as a text book to assist anyone in business - it's a first year university book for liberal arts time wasters."
3,EARLY ROGERS AND EVANS MOVIE BEFORE TEAMING AS DUO.,"A WESTERN TRAVEL AGENT'S CLERK (IN NEW JERSEY 1940'S)DISSATISFIED WITH HER POSITION DREAMS OF TAKING A TOUR OUT WEST ON HER OWN. THAT DAY COMES AND SHE RUNS AWAY FROM HER JOB AND RELATIVES TO HEAD WEST. THEY CATCH UP WITH HER IN ARIZONA AND SHE DISABLES THE CAR SO THEY CAN'T TAKE HER BACK.

THE CLERK IS THE QUEEN'S GRANDDAUGHTER, THROUGH THE MIRACLE OF FLASHBACK WE GO BACK TO THOSE DAYS ONCE AGAIN AND RELIVE THE HAPPY ENDING OF THE STORY."
5,sunset in el dorado,"I thought the movie was very good. Roy and Dale, as usual were very good together. Gabby is always tops. I wish the movie was in color but otherwise it was a very good movie."
1,smelled rancid,"I received cookies that had a terrible rancid smell, even though they were not past the expiration date. They were inedible."
1,Enjoy a cup of outdated milk with these cookies,"I liked my daughter's boyfriend's description of the Key Lime cookie, after I pawned a bag off on him. He said it tasted like one of the bad cookies you accidentally eat off of those giant platters of cheap Christmas cookies that get passed around at the holidays. Sour and a slight rancid taste to these little nuggets of nastiness. The chowhounds at work wont even eat them after they tasted one and I've seen them eat things they've dropped on the floor."
1,immagulate baking company key largo lime cookies,These were the most rancid cookies I have ever tasted. I made the mistake of ordering the chocolate cookies at the same time. They are barely edible but the key lime cookies are so bad you can't even swallow one - I was forced to spit it into the garbage. I agree with the other reviewer - even my dog won't eat the cookies. There is no way a cookie can be this rancid unless it was originally made with rancid ingredients. Amazon should drop this product.
5,This is a must for Family Guy fans!,"This is a great DVD collection of Family Guy. If you don't already own it, you must get it through Amazon. The quality is great, and the price is greater!"
1,Waste your money!,"I have purchased hundreds of items, including software from this site over the past decade plus. THIS IS THE ABSOLUTELY WORST ITEM THAT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED FROM THIS SITE OR ANYWHERE!!!!The software worked for only ONE computer!!! NUMEROUS EMAILS to wincleaner are fully ignored.THIS COMPANY IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!Do not be fooled by trolls who give this product more than one star! The company must have employees log on to give this product favorable evaluations, but read the truth for the numerous people who have been robbed by wincleaner.Offered serial number, valid purchase info., but wincleaner does not even take the time to respond w. activation code.Save your money and buy air!"
4,Greenblatt and Shakespeare,"It's a very interesting read. Greenblatt explores the different aspects of Shakespeare's life, even the parts with which we're not sure. There is a lot of, ""Let's imagine that..."" or ""Perhaps Shakespeare experienced this..."" that let's the imagination flow, while also being historical. A good read that takes you on the many possible paths that Shakespeare could have crossed."
3,"Good content, bad interpretations.","I have read about six or seven books that one might consider ""biographies"" of the elusive man from Stratford. While I enjoyed the rich historical context provided in Greenblatt's book, he seemed unable to keep his modern and, I suspect, homosexual ""filters"" from tainting his interpretation of who Shakespeare was and how a 16th century man might see the world. Sometimes wildly so, leaving me with a strong impression of Mr. Greenblatt's world view, but unconvinced that his Shakespeare was not, in fact, a projection of Greenblatt himself.I must say that Greenbblatt's writing was fluid and a pleasure to read!"
4,Shakespeare's life(?),"Given the paucity of actual documents from him, it is extremely difficult for anyone to construct a definitive biography of William Shakespeare. That has not stopped many folks from attempting to do so, however. This book is another in that train, and I found it fairly well-written, although my attention wandered at times while reading it. The author has done his best in this book, but it is riddled with ""perhaps"", ""possibly"", ""it could have"", and other qualifiers of that ilk. The examination of many of the plays, however, is first-rate, and for that alone the book is worth reading."
2,"I finished it, but I was disappointed.","This book popped up on so many lists of the best books of the year, I just had to read it. It was a quick read, and I found the sections about the speculations regarding Shakespeare's family's possible hidden connections to underground Catholicism probably the most interesting part of the book. Unfortunately, this was also the most speculative part of the book, and I didn't really believe most of the things Greenblatt suggested Shakespeare did during this period of his life.Most of the time, when I don't like a book, I don't finish reading it. There are just too many good books out there. I finished this one, but I found the analysis of both the plays and the historical background of Shakespeare facile and not compelling at all. I can't believe that so many people thought this was one of the best books of 2004. There wasn't anything terribly wrong with it. Two stars for the regret I felt after I read it that I could have spent my time better elsewhere!"
1,Imagine THIS!,"I decided to underline the passages prefaced with ""let's imagine,"" ""may have,"" ""supposedly,"" etc. I'm just beginning Chapter 5 and already, I need a new pencil lead refill.I have just finished reading Greenblatt's Will in the World and must point out the author's mention of certain reference materials used. He says: ""Though by definition unreliable and often wildly inaccurate, some of the most searching reflections on Shakespeare's life have come in the form of fiction..."" He then lists some novels and, of all things, the screenplay for the movie Shakespeare in Love. I can only imagine how an Oxfordian scholar would be derided for a similar choice of source material. Unreliable and wildly inaccurate fiction is exactly how I would describe Greenblatt's ""Pulitzer Prize finalist"" of a book."
3,"Good, but tentative collection of essays","First, this is NOT a biography of Shakespeare but a collection of essays arranged in a roughly chronological order. The life-records of WS just aren't enough to provide a proper narrative.Greenblatt stretches the limit in speculation. Virtually every other sentence begins with a qualifier like ""perhaps."" While I was reading this book I was dazzled by Prof. G's hand-is-quicker-than-the-eye dexterity. After finishing it, though, I realized that I'd actually learned very little.As an interesting scholarly speculation, this book is of some importance to readers of WS. Certainly it is not suitable as a first biography for novices. It's a pretty easy read; do it for fun, not profit."
1,will we know?,"A lot of work, it seems, for very little, since so little is known of shakespeare's life and this book adds nothing except for equivocation. here are thousands, seemingly of the form ""he may have gone [or done]XXX, or perhaps not..."" ""he could have read XXXX, or perhaps...""And there's little sense of how, such a rustic could have attainted the heights of expression and knowledge that he did.""Will..."" is a waste."
4,how shakespare became shakespare,"as i review the book , it is good item . but I did not readthe all pages , then I could'nt tell ."
5,Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare,"Author's knowledge of Elizabethan times is encyclopedic, but he does speculate, then reflect upon his speculation as established fact."
4,Interesting book,"This is one of the most interesting books that I read last year.While it is highly speculative it can be entertaining and even in portions insightful. Even though that there is no specific evidence that the Bard was a secret Catholic the events that unfolded around the area where he grew up could indicate this at least circumstantially. Where the book does take liberates I don't think Stephen Greenblatt is being deliberately sloppy he just knows that in terms of subject mater old Will has been done to death and no one is really going to add anything. So why not write something a little more speculative?Overall-It probably didn't happen but it MIGHT have happened ""all the world's a stage and men in their time play many parts"""
4,Made me want to reread Shakespeare,"Stephen Greenblatt has created a very readable account of what may have influenced Shakespeare in the creation of characters and dramatic themes. Although I am not anything remotely like a Shakespearean scholar, I have read and/or seen most of the ""big"" plays, and was fascinated by the way Shakespeare connected characters in his plays to real people; how he purposely eliminated motivation for some plot elements in order to reveal more about Hamlet's (and other characters') internal conflict; how the religious turmoil during the reigns of Henry VIII and his successors shows up in a number of the plays. The chapters in which he analyzed plays that I knew fairly well were definitely more interesting to me and have caused me to pick up my Riverside Shakespeare again. Mostly, I was impressed with Greenblatt's ability to speculate persuasively on a variety of ""mysteries"" regarding the Bard of Avon. Top-drawer non-fiction!"
5,English Teachers should read this book,I recommend this book to all English teachers to understand the new historicist critique of Shakespeare practiced by Stephen Greenblatt.
3,Too Speculative,"Any attempt to put together the pieces of someone's life, who we actually have very little biographical stuff about is very difficult. The only thing that is not speculative about this book is the setting of Elizabethian and King James England. This is actually the redemptive part of the book, in that one does learn of the time period of Shakespeare. There is much quoting of the works of Shakespeare in speculation about how that Shakespeare might have been giving us information about himself, but in the end it is all just speculation. The author does his best with what he had to work with, but he could have just as well speculated in a different direction and gave us a different Shakespeare if he had so desired."
3,like listening to a good professor,"I would really like to take a course from Professor Greenblatt. However, that being said, I had a very mixed reaction to this book. Much of the book is very light and fun and would fit in any of the ""The REAL Shakespeare"" books out there. Some of the book is very revealing and insightful and would fit alongside any of Greenblatt's critical writings. I was never sure if the next sentence would be one or the other. In a classroom, I'd enjoy that. In a book, I found it frustrating."
5,Should have won many more awards than it did...,"The fact that this book of such brilliance was denied the Pulitzer, National Book Award, etc., while trash by Maya Angelou wins such awards hand over fist speaks volumes about what is wrong with the world today.Greenblatt, a Shakespeare scholar sans pareil, provides us with unprecedented insight into the life of the world's greatest bard. This is a rare chance to see genius taking on genius."
2,a mediocre account,"I read this book for leisure over the summer, and i was completely underwhelmed. Reading reviews of it one gets the impression that it should be a very good look at Shakespeare and his work. I found it dry, almost like a text book. For anyone intrested in Shakespeare I would not reccomend this book, it is dull."
3,compliments,"I enjoyed the book a quick read with many simple easy ideas. I alsoused www.joeschedule.com to create a lot of the visual strategies the author suggests. I recommend the book and http://www.joeschedule.comFM,"
4,Great resource for all kids with special needs,"This is a parent-friendly book showing lots of easy-to-make and use visual supports. Includes many photos showing examples. Useful for children with autism spectrum disorders and any child with special needs, developmental disability."
1,Not the same,"I ordered just the bottle from Amazon, not this 3 piece set. I was wary of ordering it since Calvin Klein doesn't list it as one of their fragrances on their website anymore (for about a year or longer now) I figured I'd order it from Amazon and get the free super saver shipping instead of one of the other companies listed by Amazon. I'm not sure what happened but the smell is NOT like the Purple Orchid that I previously had. I'm very sensitive to smells and this new bottle just reeks of an incense smell which makes me nauseous. I'm glad I still have some of my old bottle left and totally bummed that it seems either the formulation changed or maybe I just got a ""bad batch."""
1,Won't stick!,"This product did not perform the way it was supposed to. It went on easily and I was pleased to have installed it to seal drafty windows with a big cold snap on the way. Within 15 minutes, however, the top had started to droop and gravity took care of the rest. I walked around and re-stuck it into place...but it peeled away again almost immediately. What a waste of money. I'll be looking for a better product."
2,Not so hot,didnt stick to my door. I had to use tape to keep it sealed on the door. This also made the door way to hard to shut. I ended up taking it off.
2,Okay product,"The product appears to be made of a good rubber material. The two pieces separate easily and when it is in place and adhered properly, seems to block undesired outdoor air from entering the house interior. My purpose was to seal a back door that is unevenly hung and has gaps both on the side where the handle latches and on the bottom. I found that even after cleaning the desired area (edge of my backdoor) and removing any debris, the adhesive material didn't last long. This may be a result of constant usage (open and closing) of my back door. This product will probably work fine around an area that is not in constant use - just my opinion."
3,not great for doors,this thing is not that great for the main entrance doors. I don't know why but it won't stay put. It probably works for windows but not doors...
4,length deceptive,"notice how this thing is two pieces attached together?when combined, they only make up half the advertised length.so u have to cut it in two to get the advertised length.anyway. it works. but my door couldnt close after this (no matter how i orientated it), so i took it off."
3,It's ok,"The reason why i'm giving this 3 stars is because it didn't really stick. I had to use tape to stick it down. but once down, my room was much warmer"
3,Does not stick well. The material is of high quality,Does not stick well. The material is of high quality. So overall it is better than other weather strips made of sponge like material
1,Won't stick,Wasted my money since it wont stick.....and I live in Las Vegas so the cold is not the issue but the glue backside wont do.
2,The Story of Thomas Alva Edison,"Did not realize that this was a children's book. I had to read a bio for book club and Amazon sent me here. Not a bad book, just written for children."
3,My order was incomplete,"The product photo shows a swaddled infant in the blanket. But when the order arrived I felt deceived. It was just a blanket and the baby wasn't included! OK, sorry, I'm kidding.... It's actually an innovative design and a well made product. It's probably better suited to cooler climates and also might be a little confining, like a straight jacket for youngsters. It was a gift to a new mother and I deduce my judgement based of the fact that I have never seen my friend's baby swaddled in it even once; but this is South Florida and perpetually very warm."
3,Pay attenchun to the track listing!!!,"Hey, I LOVE these guys (In a truly non-homosexual manner). But the problem I have with this release is the fact that it is not a ""greatest"" album. When I glanced at the tracks on the first disc, I giggled with glee thinking that an Over Kill best of finally made its way out. Quite frankly, I am sooo tired of trying to equalize and normalize all of my fave tracks for my MusicKeg. If I would have looked a little closer, I would have noticed that the track listing of disc 1 matched ""Wrecking Everything:Live"". So, In a nutshell, to all of you waiting for 'Kill to release a 'Best of', you're going to have to wait a little longer. Contained herein is 'Wrecking' and 'Killbox 13'. If you're new to Over Kill, this comes with the highest recomendation. It is a perfect blend of where they started and where they are going. For the rest, It kinda sucks if you already have these two albums. I gave it three stars for that reason alone."
2,Patchy solo effort.,"The whole problem with these Amazon online reviews is you get an avid fan of the band or artist posting a review gushing about how much they love the particular product and how everyone should rush out and buy it. Hence every product you go to has loads of 5 star reviews. The reviews of this album are typical.Anyway I'm an Antipop Constortium fan and in reality this Beans solo effort is patchy at best. There aren't enough ideas to fill a whole album and only has 2, possibly 3 standout tracks. There's plenty of filler and lots of tracks that Beans himself obviously thinks just couln't be left on the studio editing room floor.In terms of value for money this deserves only 2 stars. In other words you wouldn't be missing out by not picking it up."
4,decent set of markers with striking chromatic variety,"With 20 distinct colors, this package contains an impressive array of choice. The standard hues of the rainbow are complemented by a handful of more exotic variations.Cooler shades are well represented, with crisp and confident strokes from the purple and indigo. The greens have a bluish bias - the chartreuse comes closest to a straight green. The orange is weak and washed-out.The print on the side corresponds poorly with the ink actually produced - fans of maroon, in particular, will be unpleasantly surprised at the pale cherry-blossom stain that emerges from it.Notably absent are shades of gray, navy blue, and beige skin tones - orange, a heavy tan, and a sunshine yellow are a very limiting set of options for drawing human faces.In summary: this is a solid offering from the market leader in dry-erase markers, and will serve the casual user well, though the serious whiteboard artiste may still wish for more."
3,Poor eraseability,"We had been purchasing EXPO exclusively in the past because they erased the best without having to use whiteboard cleaner. However, recent purchases we have found that these in particular do not erase as well as the older ones. We use them on white tile board and porcelain boards. They especially fail to erase on the tile boards. We have moved all of these to the rooms with the porcelain boards. The non-low order seem to erase better. I guess we could have just gotten a bad batch."
5,This actionpacked book will have readers glued to it!,"Gabool the searat king steals Joseph's marvelous bell and casts his daughter,Mariel, out to sea. Mariel is taken to Redwall Abbey and she thinks her father is dead.With three adventurous comrads Mariel sets off to avenge her father. But little did she know that her father is raising an army to attack Gabool! Together they risk their lives to rid the ocean of searats"
4,Fun to Read,"This story is about a mouse named Mariel. Escaping from the wild rat king, but nearly drowned in doing so. She loses her memory from almost drowning. She ends up in Redwall gaining friends and getting her memory back. Finding help from her new friends she journeys to defeat he rat king. the book is really good and has alot of detail without being to wordy. There is a lot of action fighting battles, and wild beasts. It has a plot that keeps you hanging not knowing what will happen next. It was hard fo me to put down, I wanted to know what would happen next. For these reasonsI think the book is really good. I recommend this book for anybody to read."
5,An wonderful book,"This is one of those rare books. Good main plot, good subplots, every thing you would need. This is the story of Mariel, a mouse maid who sets out to kill Gabool the wild. This book takes place before Redwall and Mattimeo(both really good books) and after Mossflower(also a good book)."
5,An wonderful book,"This is one of those rare books. Good main plot, good subplots, every thing you would need. This is the story of Mariel, a mouse maid who sets out to {get} Gabool the wild. This book takes place before Redwall and Mattimeo(both really good books) and after Mossflower(also a good book)."
4,Merial of Redwall by Lee,"Meriel of RedwallWhere you ever thrown of a ship with ship with a rope around your neck? Meriel, the Mouse Maid, was on a ship in a storm when she was cast on a log. Then a segall attacked by a seagull. She tried to stop it but if she did she would drown.She did make it back to land, but how would she survive? Where would she get food and water? How would she gel home? That's for you to find out!I thought the plot was good. I think the best part is when seagulls attacked her. I liked this part because I kept me on the edge of my seat. Also I liked the part were she is being attacked by toads. They almost killed he but the long patrol saved her."
5,Very good,"The book was just what I wanted. Came in great shape. Every one will enjoy this book, cover art is great"
2,"The worst of the Redwall series, pretty disappointing","I have read almost all of the Redwall series, and I have loved most of them enough to read them several times, but Mariel of Redwall was severely lacking the usual beauty and magic of the previous books. The story was simply boring at times, and there is nothing that draws you to Mariel as a likeable character as Matthias, Mattimeo, or Martin did, in fact she is fairly close to just being plain annoying. I love Jacques' work and am only strongly criticizing this book because it does not nearly live up to his usual standards. Salamandastron is much better, so I suggest reading this book only to follow in the sequence, because it is not that good at all, and the death of the bad sea pirate character is rather disturbing especially for young children."
2,Why Mice???,"This book wasn't worth all the hype given from all the other onliners. The main character was a female mouse, a total grade school type of theme. If the characters werent' mice, I would have gave this book 4 stars. I mean, who can relate to and understand a pack of mice without the author's help?"
2,Good for fat people,"By now everyone can predict these things about redwall: 1-There have to be about 500 different charactersof 8 anny\oying species2- Every 20 pages there is another walleper due feast (woopee doo,it's cake) 3- 1 of the 500 different annoying characters will die. 4- The vermin leaders always seem to be brave, togh, cunning, and good fighters until they meet with the main character then they get so scared they just have to fall into pits and stuff 5- There always have tobe some kind of mini war going that pit vermin agasit vermin and the vermin that's first mention in the book always seem to win. 6- Somehow a bunch of mice can always beat up well trained warriors 7 it's not about the numbers, it's a bout heart and determination, so even"
4,Fourth Redwall Book is a Keeper,"If you would like to read a book that is part mystery, part fantasy and much, much more read ""Mauriel of Redwall."" Mauriel, (who seems like a female Martin the Warrior)is hurt and nearly killed by a viscious searat hoarde that killed her father. She loses her memory, but is saved by the Redwall woodlanders. Her memory revived she quests for the searats and is determined to find her true self and kill the searats who nearly killed her and killed her father...."
4,Quite good,This book was very good. I read it about five years ago and enjoyed it. There were some funny parts and a lot of talk about food. I recomend this book to the young readers.
5,The BEST book in the Redwall collection!!!,"Mariel,Dandin,Durry,all go questing to find more crulity and then find the Urgan Nagru and his female partner,Silvermond,siqe controle of Southsward.Then Josheph has a dream with martin the warrior in it and he tells the bellmaker to find his daugfhter."
5,Dazziling!,"My advice-buy this book. If you like Redwall you'll love this book.(duh,it is Redwall) This book paints pictures in your mind."
3,A shadow...,"I was very disapointed with this book. This book is a shadow of Mossflower, and Mattimeo. Well, remember the Badger and the Bell in Mattimeo? Here is almost the same thing:The Otter and his Wife! Then in Mossflower they have lotta probs with toads... Mariel dose too. In Mossflower they have a little rhyme map, same in Mariel. I found more little things, so shoot me! I'm just too durn lazy to type 'em. This book dose make up for it at the end. It's really neat how they become oar slaves and how Mariel dose not, and their little plan on how to get rid of Gabool. I just wish I knew Joseph's response when Dandin said that he knows, not knew, Mariel and that she is not dead. If you are going to read The Bellmaker you should read this too so that you have some background info and don't get a headache.P.S. The little sword and spirt thing of Martin, this is not too go of an ex, he overdose it at one moment and under dose it the next.P.P.S. The riddle is very disapointing."
3,"Okay, but not that good.","This book is okay,but not as good as the others. The beginning is very boring. I don't like Gabool. He gets very crazy and boring.The first parts were boring but the ending battle is much better. I have read all of the books out so far and this one is my least favorite out of them. The Bellmker is good for a sequel. I don't like seafaring books much. The only seafaring book I do like is Pearls of Lutra. All in all this book is not one of the best."
5,fighter of evil,"when mariel and her father,joseph are thrown off a ship by the searat king, Gabool she loses her memory, but is taken to redwall and remembers she sets off with two friends and is DETERMINED to get revenge on Gabool, there a thrilling adventure begins"
3,"Starts good, ends bad/","This book began with a really sweet beginning, all dramatic and cool, but it just kept getting more and more boring as things went on. The sequel to this book is awesome though, so I still highly reccomend this book!"
5,12V 2A DC To DC Converter,"Have used this item many times on many applications, all with great success. I use a 12 volt battery and power all my DC needs with this converter. Works great in my solar powered trailer."
3,Good info but not enough one-on-one,"This documentary has some great information on new and unclassified military objectives from the U.S. arsenal. However, if you're looking for one-on-one cockpit views and interviews with pilots this isn't where you want to start. There was almost too much information and not enough inside commentary. Since I am a jetaholic, I really wanted to see more of the inside of the cockpit and listen to the pilots talk to each other, and to AWACS, and feel the g-force of the maneuvers. I also would liked to have seen more strategic action plans,(within limits of military intelligence), you know, more war stuff. This was basically a mediocre demo for military aircraft and other machines and artilary."
1,The Agenda is Clear !!,"The agenda is quite clear - to mislead the people and to alleviate the status of those people who were clearly enemies of the mission of the Prophet of Islam. The author calls Muawiyah ""a person of Hilm"" and ""indeed Ameerul Mumineen"". I think it is sufficient to introduce Muawiyah as ""son of Hinda"" and somebody who fathered ""Yazeed"" Muawiyah was kind and forbearing only when he had to face a powerful person who, he feared, might curb his power and topple his government. If Anybody wants to learn about his treachery - he should study the terms of his agreement with Hasan ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib and see how much he remained faithful to the terms of the agreement. He was simply a power hungary politician. There are other better authors who have been quite neutral in judging about personalities."
4,Shawnee Vocabulary,"This is an interesting book from a historical linguistics perspective. It is a reprint of an 1850's vocabulary of Shawnee recorded by Indian agent Richard Cummings. It is a very small volume, however, and there is no phonetic key. For what it is, this is a good book, but don't buy it expecting to learn the Shawnee language from it."
5,This book is great!,"We received the book and it was in better condition than described. We bought the book for a friend that was going to give it to their mother, however after she seen the condition of the book she decided to keep it and get her mother another copy. Thank you for everything."
2,TABLETS WERE SENT NOT CAPS.,"Tablets were very,.very hard and large, and not capsules.You should state clearly 500mg 100 Tablets. Not very pleased about that."
5,no complaints,"Nice quantity and size for the money. Has a yellow coating (""an aqueous coating"") on the tablet that enhances absorption supposedly, which is nicer than a capsule or typical tablet. Happy with purchase, would buy again.Easier than eating a bunch of eggs to get choline.Choline Bitartrate 500mg, 100 tablets."
5,No Choline deficiency here,Since I started taking these I think I've been getting enough choline...Choline is good for your brain. Hurray for Choline!
4,Enjoy this product,Feel the that this is a good value for the price of this product and you will not find it for cheaper elsewhere.
3,Keeps me awake,I purchased choline - not this brand along with piracetam - started taking both before bed time to help induce lucid dreams. Every time I take them before bed I lay awake all night. Not sure if they are helping brain functions yet - only been using for a week.
4,Highly organizer kit,"I am a second year home schooling mom of 2 kids who needed to get organized. The Home School Organizer truly helped me to put things together and know where all my stuff is located. It gives me lots of space to work in for our weekly journal area and I love the weekly check list for the kids. I feel it's a great investment, especially for 2 or more kids."
2,Reads like it was written by a businessman rather than a Mom,"I bought this book expecting that I would get my homeschool organized, keed track of all my kids records and get some guidance on how to do this homeschool thing. But it reads like it was written by a businessman rather than someone trying to homeschool. In addition, Christianity was the only offering for religious studies. I also had to add many more sections to cover all of my needs adding to the over-all cost, as well as having more than the alotted 4 students. Over all I was disappointed and wished I had saved my homeschooling money for a better product. I will keep searching."
5,"Sober,Somber, Elegiac Songs","This collection of love-lost and the the anguished aftermath songs are hauntingly effective in conveying the soul wrenching and soul draining effect of a major relationship meltdown. Hinson's craggy voice is not an angel's but one of a guy who who has to-must let these songs out.The songs are basic but beautifully framed .The last track alone-The Day Texas Sank to the Bottom of the Sea- is worth the purchase. It's one of the most achingly beautiful, SADDEST songs, EVER."
2,Don't buy this version!,"I have the 2nd version of this book. And I checked the 3rd version difference with its previoud version. Mostly re-organized the contents into new chapters, very few new content added. No descriptions on what's new in updated version. Worst of all, I checked the book in Borders: it has no appendices at all! The last chapter is chapter 32, ends at 10XX page, and there should be 4 appendices after it, then comes the Index at page 13XX. To my surprise, the publishing house just cut the appendices pages so the book jumps from 10XX to 13XX, the Index!So, don't buy this version."
3,Too long - okay information,"This book did have understandable information and was a help to me when I first got it. However, it is way too long (and sometimes using more words than necessary to explain a thing can make it harder to understand.) Also, some of the things it said just aren't quite correct."
2,Looong Read,"I was disappointed for several reasons, especially since this book is labeled as being part of the ""Programmer to Programmer"" series:1> Overly long with trite examples covering up the real essence. They often take several pages to convey an idea which, assuming the reader is an experienced programmer, should only take a few sentences.2> That this is a collective effort shows. Some chapters are half-way decent, others are rather poor.3> No help for the programmer on how to leverage existing code in C# .NET modules.4> Very little on how things work, or why they are the way they are. This makes remembering the quirks of the language / framework rather difficult."
4,"Quiet, but case needed filing to fit",One of the main reasons I bought the Corsair 620w HX was because it was rated as being quiet. I can verify that. It is very quiet. But I had to file 3 of 4 holes in my computer case for it to fit. I had to file 1/32 inch off on the top side of the holes.
5,"Whisper quiet, efficient, and beautiful!","This is one heck of a beautiful psu. After my enermax passed on, I was in need for a good power supply. And I couldn't ask for anything more with this one. The modular system is perfect for anyone who wants to create a clean look in their case, as well as helps with the airflow because you only fill up the case with wires you use. The psu is very quiet. My enermax, I could hear it in the other room, but this one, I can only hear it when I initially turn it on. Another plus about this unit is that it is highly efficient with the power it draws from your outlets. I have no bad talking points about this at all. Even the price, is good, considering that anything less expensive is also of much lower quality."
5,update power supply for dell xps 400,"my dell is a xps 400 with a 375watt power supply. I want to upgrade due to the new graphic cards on the market (ati 4750). Well i brought the corsair hx520 and swapCorsair CMPSU-520HX 520-Watt HX Professional Series 80 Plus Certified Power Supply compatible with Core i7 and Core i5the power supply went without a hitch, it took more then 1 hour because im new to it and careful. I love corsair so i brought the hx 1000 for a new build I'm about to start with an asus pt6 deluxe v2 motherbord."
3,Died after use,"The PSU died after a few hours of use, connected to only 1 VGA when this is boasted for SLI. Looks sturdy enough, build with good components and parts, Modular feature is just a plus for me. Gonna give it another try, when RMA gets in."
5,Best PSU I have ever bought.,After numerous PC builds over the years I have found probably the best PSU on the market in a long time. Corsair really outdid the competition with this PSU. Excellent AMAZON service included with the excellent product at a great price.
1,The first PSU to fail me in 15 years!!!,"I have been building PCs for the last 15 years and never had problems with any PSU even though they are not branded.This time I thought I try this one since it is a top seller. unfortunately I kept getting warning messages that my graphics card (EVGA 8800GT) is not adequately powered. The PC kept crashing on me.I have never thought that the culprit would be the PSU, so I tried every thing blaming the MB, then the graphics card (I almost RMA the card) and in thier forums, they blame it on the card compatibility with their PSU!!! BSThen, one fine evening & out of curiosity only, I replaced the coarsir PSU with an old one I had and surprise surprise the power warning disappeared.Bottomline; don't waste your money on this one. Buy from PSU experts instead (thermaltake, zalman, ...)"
1,Weird problem.,"I was robbed. I bought a $160.00 PSU Corsair CMPSU-620HX 620W for my new computer in SLI mode. My sorprise was that I found inside the box a cheap ULTRA 500-Watt $39.00 PSU. The box was right, it came with plastic, etc. but the content doesnt. What happend?I pay $160.00 for this:Corsair CMPSU-620HX 620W SLI Certified Modular ATX Power SupplyI got this $39.00:Ultra / X-Connect / 500-Watt / ATX / Dual 80mm Fan / MS-Blue / UV Clear Sides / Modular Power SupplyFew days later...Replacement came next week. I already installed it, and I just can say: Excelent PSU!!! I still have the question: Why an ULTRA PSU came inside of an original box of CORSAIR 620HX? Who knows."
5,Amazing,I have never seen a video as breathtaking as this. The use of Tangerine Dream musically was a stroke of genius. Have seen David's other work and this is up there with some of his other projects. Hope to see more of him in the future.
2,Pretty Pictures- Pretty Horrible Music,"This project feels like an attempt at a ""Baraka"" knockoff. Unfortunately it's a rather feeble attempt. Although a lot of the images are undeniably beautiful, they are frequently marred by poor editing: camera bumps, abrupt fade outs, digital noise in places and overuse of filter type effects which lend many scenes an odd artificiality ala ""What Dreams May Come"". Also as another reviewer points out, the snappy pace of the constantly scudding clouds is more like an MTV music video than a meditation on Nature's serene beauty. What really mars the whole experience is the incredibly insipid music by Suzanne Cianni and Patrick O'Hearn. I'm afraid it's New Age music at its worst (I don't hate all New Age stuf,f BTW) with banal melodies, shopworn chord progressions and unrelentingly cheesy synthesized textures guaranteed to kill off brain cells as you listen.Not recommended except in cases of recent brain surgery."
3,Background music & video for parties,"The ultimate in relaxation / background images & music. Watch weather patterns shift over some of the USA''s most beautiful & timeless landscapes including Monument valley, The Canadian Rockies, winter landscapes of the high desert etc etc etc."
2,Not what it is hyped up to be...,"This DVD was no my recommended list because I'd bought Baraka. But that's probably the best reason for not buying it - if you've seen Baraka or movies of its quality you'll be badly disappointed by this one. Its too bad because I really wanted to like it...Earthscapes has no theme other than mostly timelapse filmed landscapes with endless clouds rushing by. As ""A Viewer"" pointed out, the landscapes may be beautiful but it is far from relaxing. Earthscapes has a less than quality soundtrack that does nothing to improve the otherwise disconnected film sequences.If I had an LCD projector I'd probably throw this movie up on the wall once in a while with some of my own more appropriate music dubbed over it but otherwise I think its going to collect dust."
3,"Nice places, but no theme.","This isn't a bad DVD by any means. It's the sort of thing to put on in the background, for atmospherics when you're talking or reading or whatever. The photography is nice enough and the locations are pretty, but if you've seen films like Baraka or Koyaanisqatsi, then you're probably better off not bothering with this. It's not in the same league. Just my opinion."
1,Don't bother,"I'd just been watching Chronos by Ron Fricke, which is excellent, then played this back to back. It just doesn't stand up. The images themselves are fine, but there are too many things that are wrong. The way the camera pans across the landscape is horrible, very mechanical, makes you feel like a robot. Then the editing is just plain bad, cuts happen with absolutely no feel for the music that is happening underneath.I managed to last thru the first five minutes and it was like someone scratching their nails down a chalkboard."
5,relax forever,"I've found that Enya's ""A Day Without Rain"" album goes beautifully with this DVD.... make sure to turn the volume down on the television, the volume up on the stereo, Enya's on repeat (the entire album), and sync the video and the music to start as if you've already prepared and played both, pausing the album to start at the first track after stopping the video to press play at the same time (Miramar sequence should be seen first with the music) if anyone has any more great videos or music to share or would like to know other music/video combinations I've enjoyed, please write me..... thanks"
4,Great for a beginner,"I purchased this along with my first Wok at Christmas, and I must say that this book gets a ton of use. The recipes are easy to follow, and reasonable replacements are listed for hard to find ingredients. The recipes are also adjustable when you get the hang of things, and I haven't had a bad recipe yet. I gave the book only four stars because of a lack of images and that it is just a tad on the basic side, but this in conjunction with other Chinese recipe books can help a beginner like myself and my wife make our first steps into cooking Chinese cuisine. As a stand alone guide, this book may lack in a few areas, but as part of a collection, you will find yourself referencing this one time and time again."
4,The Memorial War Book,"Excellent book, well done and easy to read. Very nice maps and lots of pictures. Very easy to move around on CD."
1,disapointed Motorcraft DY1081 Oxygen Sensor,well look at the pic i see three separate wires... i received one thinking that this was a complete set for my truck maybe the picture should be one wire.. so now i have to buy the rest of the parts only recv.1 the wire on left
3,"Cute, but boring for kids.",Daughter loves Bratz & Barbies... but after a day... this toy has not been played with again. It also broke off a leg where my husband had to do man stuff with glue to put together again.
3,Some inaccuracies,Just to add to one of the other reviews. The accusation of massacre at the Battle of Arras is based upon very flimsy evidence and should not be repeated in print. Powaski says that the French 1st Army marched by night as well as by day to reach Gembloux by 14th May. He should of course have said that it marched by day as well as by night ( day marches were not common due to the threat of air attack). Basic mistakes for a professional historian.
3,As said before....,"....some faults, the Fort of Douaumont is actualy located in France and not in Belgium so this is an entertaining read albeit i would not advise it to the serious student of history if you do not have some basic knowledge of the facts about the campaign already."
5,It works very well,"This AV cable works as it is claimed to. It produces the correct and a very good clean signal. I have no complaints. The output is analog composite video and analog audio. It works great as input into my analog TV and receiver. I've tried it on two different tube TVs, two different portable LCD screens and one flat screen monitor with AV inputs."
1,Did not work,"I plugged this cable into my TV, and the TV did not recognize the source, I'm not sure it the TV needs to be digital."
5,Rust Free Does the Job,I have used Boeshield Rust Free for a number of years and find it works better than any of the alternatives I have tried. I use it on my table saw bed to eliminate casual rust strains from day-to-day use. It's also good for cleaning lightly rusted tools. I am careful to rinse very thoroughly with hot water after removing stains. This keeps the clean look longer. It's probably not the best thing for heavily rusted applications.
5,Amazing,"I stored all of my woodworking equipment while moving, and applied oil to all the cast iron tables hoping to prevent rust. Well that didnt work so well, i was sick to look at my rusty equipment. Bought Boeshield Rust Free, and it works great, using a red Scotch Bright pad, it will remove all the rust. But some minor staining has remained, but im really happy with the results."
4,Does what it says.,"I bought this product as a package with the T-9. I used it on a shaper I just bought. The shaper had been in storage so it had a considerable amount of surface rust. I did have to use a Scotch bright pad to help some of the stains and heavier rust but it did come up with little effort. It does have a rotten egg smell to it, but not terrible."
2,Disappointing,"This is nothing more than CLR, which is available lot's cheaper at the grocery or hardware store. The spray top did not work and it arrived leaking badly. Buy CLR, it works the same and is cheaper."
2,A toner?,"I got a little buzz, it was nothing to write home about, and then, nada! zip, nothing! I was so diappointed, because it was supposedly designed by a woman...was she designing in the dark? Or worse, from a satelite office?"
3,"Good explanation of creating shareholder value, but...","Professor Rappaport's revised version of his 1986 book on creating shareholder value provides a good description of the value based management concept that he helped create. However, many of the chapters are stand alone sections that do not flow well together. In some chapters he does not provide enough depth on how this book can actually be used by managers. In addition, the chapters on using his concepts to formulate value-maximizing business strategies was somewhat lacking.Nevertheless, the book was an easy read and many of his points were right on target. I would also highly recommend interested readers to check out ""The Value Imperative"" by Marakon Associates and ""Valuation"" by McKinsey & Co for more information on value based management."
4,Higher Understanding,A great guide for those wanting to gain a higher level of understanding of corporate decision making. I found it useful within my own business unit and plan to bring back some of the concepts. Read this book if you have a desire to stand out by analyzing decisions like a corporate officer.
4,wishbone ash a long lost band,this is a band a lot of people forgot about lots of good music the dvd I have could have a better sound track droped out a lot but it is a very good show
4,Outstanding!,"Loritts' easy to read tribute to his father is a ""must read"" for any father who is striving to not only ""talk the talk"" but ""walk the walk"" with his own children. This down to earth story gripped me from the beginning and I couldn't put it down until I had read the whole book through in one sitting. You won't be dissapointed by learning the lessons that Crawford Lorrits has to offer about loving God and sharing that love with your family.Randy Conleyrandyc@blanchardtraining.co"
5,Thailand without any BS,"I leave the Kingdom tomorrow loaded down with books to read when I get back but this book intrigued me enough to dip into it while I'm here and then I had to keep reading. It is fiction and fact and a satirical takeoff on detective fiction written by someone who obviously knows Thailand. His encounters with Thai women shows he knows a few things about them too - not enough to come out ahead - but still more than most. Writing was good, usually witty. Great looking woman on the cover sure attracts a reader at least a male reader to the book. Some of the encounters with Thai women are really funny. Highly recommended. Not a book for the whole family though."
4,Fun Eash Read with cute anecdotes about life in Thailand,"The book was a fun, lighthearted look at the life of a detective encountering situations and people who could only come from Thailand. Anyone interested in a look at life in Thaiand should enjoy this book."
5,Great cultural insights,"For anyone going to work or do missions trips in a hot climate culture, this book is a must! It's concise but touches on the basics of the difference betweeen North American/northern European culture and other cultures. I have found the insights and stories very applicable to my work in African and Asian countries. And as a bonus, it is an easy book to read."
3,Quite interesting but very superficial,"I just read this book and found it interesting because it actually puts labels on some of the things that I have experienced as a person who immigrated to a new country about 4 years ago. On the other hand, the author's insights are sometimes so superficial to the point that they make her seem naive."
2,Good but could be better.,"While I enjoyed reading this, I read this as part of a cultural studies class. Since I was preparing to travel to Eastern Europe, I found it very disappointing that she only mentioned Eastern Europe once (and it was just Russia!) I wish she would include a section on this. If you aren't interested in Eastern European culture, read instead ""How I survived Communism and Even Laughed"" and ""Cafe Europa"". They are much better."
5,A Blessing to the World Traveller,"As short as this book may be, the words and insight provided on these pages is essential for anyone from any walk of life entertaining the idea of world travel. It gives you something to work with in understanding other people's views. Excellent read!"
4,great shorts for the price,"I bought these shorts for my U10 team. They are a great short for the price, and perfect for hot weather. The only thing preventing 5 stars, is that they are thin enough to be slightly transparent, at least in orange."
5,Nice Shorts,Good construction and the are comfortable. Would have liked them to be cotton but hard to find AFL shorts online.
5,Beautiful ring. Good value. Excellent service.,"While I browsing Amazon's Jewelry store, this ring definitely caught my attention! Although I was looking for a diamond setting I found myself going back for a second and third look at this ring. In the end, I purchased two rings - the diamond and this aquamarine.Littman processed the order within 24 hours and shipped it FedEx 2nd-Day at no charge.I gave my wife the aquamarine when it was delivered. She loves it! The diamond ring will be a ""little extra"" surprise for her birthday.P.S. Be sure to click on the ""See Larger Image"" link to really appreciate the beauty of this ring."
4,"effective, seems overpriced","The insinkerator design makes installation a snap (see your manual, or check google for instructions... very easy). So far no splash back. Only negative... it's a rubber gasket, I can't imagine this is worth more than a buck or two..."
5,Exactly what I was hoping for,"It does its job and looks pretty good doing it. The disposal doesn't seem as smelly after installing this. The install was a bit rough, but I had a friend help me squeeze the gasket and disposal up as far into the sink as possible to catch the grooves. Locked in place and have had no issues."
4,Does the job!,"Arrived quickly & packaged well. Everything as described. Easy to install.I had read stories about how difficult it would be, not true in my case."
2,no point in it!,"whats the point this is sellections of demonic-bad cd and the gathering++great cd and then the first strike is still deadly,point?cheap 2 disc set?another paycheck?just another record company ploy to get you to spend your money and the band makes a couple dollars too.DISC 1:1.

2,Shoes has a bad odor....,Even after letting them open to air for few days.Iam not sure if its just the shoe i bought or all r made that way!Design wise they r good and compact.
2,A Bit Misleading,"The title is a bit misleading in that it markets itself as the ""original soundtrack."" It only has the Red Shoes Ballet music - not the entire soundtrack. It contains music from another ballet, which is alright but not why I purchased this CD. Also, the Red Shoes Ballet is played at a much faster tempo than in the film."
1,Wonderful music but flawed recording...,"Wonderful film and soundtrack.This particular CD is recorded straight from record though - and it shows unfortunetly. Background noise, hiss, pops and crackles aplently.Save your money and buy a different version instead unless a die hard fan after the 'Prelude' part of the soundtrack."
5,Smashing Love Story for Gays and Lesbians,"I just finished ""The Wild Man"" yesterday and still feel the reality of it. I could swear those main characters, two men and two women, are alive somewhere because of the depth with which they are developed. Wish I could meet and shake hands with them because they were such interesting people and their love for each other is so real, despite the many hardships. Warren has a deep knowlege of Spain which makes the story so authentic. While it took a few pages to get into the story, once there, I could not put the book down. I fell in love with the coto (game reserve) and the relationship with it that the characters had. The Spaniards contain a quality in their personality that derives from a respect for the beauty of life and the earth around them. But its Warren's development of the love story that shows the genius of this author that 10 million copies in print of her earlier work ""The Front Runner"" bears witness to."
2,A Disappointment,"This book appears to have been written before The Front Runner, which remains the best of all of this author's work in my opinion. I enjoyed the historical references to Franco Spain and especially the role of the Roman Catholic church there, but the book dragged."
3,way too predictable,"If you listen to Hevia for the first time, you can be at least pleasantly surprised that with bagpipes one can compose such an easylistening, yet swift music with folk elements. Nevertheless, if you already know Hevia's first album, you will be a bit disappointed. Nothing new, just a variation on the same topic. Some become stale after a few albums (Enigma, Enya), others, such as Hevia, right with the second one. Anyway, the question is, if music wich such an arrangement ever has a chance to create more than just one interesting album."
4,Great markers - as long as you read the fine print,"I bought these for our office whiteboards. The colors are great and very vibrant. I was really disappointed when some of the markers dried up within a few months... further research into the product revealed that by storing the markers upright, was shortening their life. I do recommend these markers as long as you can store them horizontally."
3,Colors do not match product description,"The product description says ""Aqua, Black, Blue, Brown, Forest Green, Green, Orange, Pink, Plum, Purple, Red, Turquoise, Yellow"", but there was no 'Yellow'. What I got is more close to the picture ... instead of two pinks in the picture there were two dark blues."
1,Low odor ink doesn't erase easily...,"The low odor ink pens are worthless... They do not erase cleanly.Get the ""original ink"" pens (one might wonder why they would phrase it that way on their product)."
2,Not Typical Expo Quality,"The tips started breaking (fraying) and becoming really soft after initial use. For example, one of the felt tips was ruined by the time I wrote a sentence. Typical Expo markers keep their shape, even after about four years, but these didn't. I would also like to let you know that the colors aren't the same as the one in the picture, there are two reds, blacks, greens, and blues, and the rest were a different variety."
4,Good,"I like the product, but I think that Wal Mart had a better price on these. I would look around for a better price"
5,EXPOS!!!,"The name alone means AWESOME! What more can I say, my kids love the fact that ""teach"", that's me, mom, writes in funky cool colors!"
4,dry erase markers,"I prefer a straight rather that a chisel tip. Also, the light colors are not useful on a white board...and maybe I use them too much, but they seem to run out of ink fast."
3,You're wild!,"This album was released in 1967, as a side project by Michael Nesmith while he was still with the Monkees. It features instrumental versions of Nesmith songs that he had already recorded with the Monkees, played by a huge 51 piece orchestra. The songs have pretty eccentic arrangements, to the point that some of them are barely recognizable, if you are familiar with the Monkees' versions of these songs. A moderately entertaining album. The CD version of the album is basically an ""official"" bootleg released by Michael Nesmith himself. The CD was mastered from playback of an old mono vinyl LP. It is available from Michael Nesmith's official website (Videoranch)."
2,Not his best work,I love Red Skelton and was hoping to see some of the shows I had memories of but the shows on this set are OK but not what I expected. I probably should look for a collection of skits instead of entire shows.
1,Avoid at all costs,"I bought this item through Amazon. Loved it. 6 months later, it totally fell apart. I called Amazon. They referred me to the seller UNBEATABLE SALES. Unbeatable Sales was no help, basically told me to find a manufacturer that is unfindable, somewhere in Taiwan.Through a series of phone calls. I did call Walker's Warehouse who were very helpful.Even so, the cloth material in this Denise Austin product totally frayed and fell apart with normal use after 6 months. A definite ripoff. I am very leery of other products sold under the Denise Austin brand name and/or sold by Unbeatable Sales."
1,waster of money,"I purchased this with the hope of walking and toning. It is not a good ""weight"" The belt is not very big, and its uncomfortable. When your walking you have nowhere to put your water bottle. Def. a bad purchase for the price"
2,Bad,"The shoe looks better on the picture than it does on my feet. Didn't like the craftsmanship, for a shoe of this price, the material used at the insole seems cheap and slippery, making the foot slide down, plus the insole is not well glued to the shoe. Also the paper that protected the shoe stuck to the shoe itself."
4,Excellent hands-on approach,"Freeborn's book presents a very useful hands-on approach to the evolution of the English language. He provides lots of REAL texts (including many in facsimile form) in the various dialects of Old English, and so on. At once, the reader feels that the subject is not really as remote as he or she might have imagined. This makes the book very useful as a textbook or a source book for a course introducing students to the history of the English language. I have just received a flyer announcing the arrival of an expanded second edition (due mid 1998), and am therefore looking forward to reading it."
3,Good but I expected more.,"Not nearly as good as The Man With The Barbwire Fists (another short story collection by Partridge) Mr. Fox is still enjoyable - if you can describe Partridge's brutal and forceful prose as ""enjoyable"". Much of his writing blows my mind. His phrasing, descriptions, action sequences, etc. the guy is just a genius. It's a pity he doesn't write more novels.I will say this however. Much of this book, half perhaps, are kind of journal/diary notes from partridge about the stories, his career, his advice, etc. and while it is interesting, i did find myself skipping over the majority of it. I don't want a ""how to"" book. I loved the intro to Barbwire Fists - it was poignant and hysterical - but much of that type of writing feels like filler in Mr. Fox.Still, a ""sub-par"" Partridge is better than a ""high quality"" anybody else."
3,Bare Bones/ No Frills Rock 'n' Roll Show,"Videotaped (poorly) with no budget for effects. The band is explosive and Wendy is well...you know, Wendy. Wearing nothing more than a black leather bra, panties, and tennis shoes for much of the show,( and still in perfect condition), she is truly all the effects the show needs. There's not much of Wendy on film, so this DVD is probably all were going to get anytime soon.Buy it and be glad you got that much. What a voice!"
3,wild wendy,"A good concert by Wendy even if she is ""prude"" more than what we have the habit to see from her.Well film so we see what we want to see."
2,not much help,"I was expecting a turn key guide - I just didn't see it in this book. This book had some good info but not detailed enough for me - a lot of high level, basic, common sense information. I have been a landlord for many years and own many properties. I wanted to use this book to tap into the lease-options market - I will need to keep researching. I am actually a little upset I purchased this book - it was too expensive for what I got."
5,Concisely written guide packed with info and insights!,"Matthew Chan's Turnkey Investing is a great resource for those of us who are looking to break into real estate investing. In the book Matthew Chan covers some of the most important aspects of his real estate investing strategy so that the investor can invest safely and successfully. With Matthew's sensible and practical explanations he gives the reader a better understanding of his style of real estate investing. Unlike many of the ""get rich quick"" books out on the market Matthew Chan's Turnkey investing has a plethora of usable content."
5,"Great hose. Flexible, plenty long.","The old hose on my shop vac was starting to kink due to several years of use. It was time to get a new one. I wanted a hose that was longer than the 6' hose I currently have because I like to hook it up to some of my power tools to suck the dust when in use. This 8' hose is perfect. The plastic material is strong but very flexible making it easy to use. The hose ends are re-enforced with a snap on mechanism so they don't fall off. Great product, great pcie."
4,"Fits well, nice and long, fairly sturdy","You know what I find baffling about these 2-1/2-inch hoses? They measure 2-1/4-inch. Why is that information so hard to find?I bought it because the original hose eventually failed. I left it connected and wrapped the hose around the top. This caused too much bend in the hose where it was attached to the shop vac, so it eventually crimped permanently.This hose is NO more rugged than my original hose, so if I don't break myself of my bad habits, it will eventually crimp too.I liked that it came with everything I needed for both types of vac connections: friction fit and positive lock.So why don't I give it 5 stars? Because the material seems a little more flimsy than I expected. But it might be strong enough to hold up over time, so maybe I'll come back sometime and raise my rating."
4,Warning - this book is not what it seems,"Gregory Douglas, aka Peter Stahl, is a notorious forger of wartime documents. This and his other books on Heinrich Muller are the crowning achievement of his career.As history they are completely worthless, but one can still admire the craft that went into their forging."
4,It's a great pair of cycling shoes but nothing that rocks,"Really great for the price. The drawbacks are the fact that it's not very solidly made and the materials are not very sturdy (at least thats how it feels). Though, there is nothing bad - the time will show."
5,Its Great and It IS available,"For all you folks who are waiting with bated breath for this terrific book--this is just to let you know that while marvellous Amazon says that it's not available, it just ain't so. It is available and has been since the end of March. If you can't get it through Amazon, you might want to go directly to the US publisher at quitespecificmedia.com"
4,Good starter book,"I would use this as either a good starter book or an addition to a collection on period clothing. Not comprehensive enough if you really want a lot of info or pictures. This is useful, but limited. If you want to make a costume, this should do you up good."
4,The Tudor Tailor /from a historical costumer,"The Tudor Tailor is a book for the serious 16th century costume maker/designer/researcher. Full of color photos, patterns and period information, it is a must-have for all those who love the 16th century. I had a friend show it to me and ordered my own copy. We made a number of items using the patterns shown with relative ease. It is not for a beginning costumer or seamstress- it can be complicated and a litte confusing if you don't know what you are doing. Having made this type of clothing for over 30 years, I found it precise, organized and clear. I also ordered and received the sister book on ""The Queen's Servants"". Good investment!"
2,good work ruined,"These songs of Faure are amongst the most beautiful I know. To perform them, Elly Ameling and Gerard Souzay are the dream team.Technically this recording is absolutely inadequate, as it shows a so called comb filter effect, that is a massive distortion of the high notes. They sound brittle and completely unnatural. I am an amateur sound engineer and I know how this kind of mistake is brought about. You have to adjust the delay of the singer's microphone in a wrong way, too short or too long.The average listener does not know about those things and is prone to attribute the distortions to the singer's voice, which happened to Danielle de Niese's Händel album lately.Poor Amelie, poor Danielle, you did not deserve such carelessness, as you both are divine."
1,Don't fall for Freefall 3050 A.D.,"Unlike the sublimely trippy Tempest 3000, Freefall is NOT the kind of game that should sell you on a NUON-capable DVD player. The music and rendered animations are adequate, but the technical elements lack the polish you would find in a game title for a more mainstream system like the Playstation. Controls are stiff, graphics are plain (think first-generation PSX or Saturn), and gameplay is enervating. I bought it because of the interesting premise (who wouldn't want to be a skydiving supercop), but the bland visuals and total lack of speed and energy make this game a choice for NUON completists only. It just doesn't cut it in today's marketplace."
5,Just as said.,"Came quickly in the mail, the jigsaw is a lot stronger and sturdier than one I was using last year. It's strong and easy to work with. Very reliable."
5,Super Saw.,"This is agreat little saw, I highly recommend it for anyone who requires the beef of a big saw in a small package."
5,Excellent saw for the price,"It was delivered quickly, and works well. Possibly best for occasional use, which is what I wanted. The blades attach simply. The only criticism that I have is that the 90 degree blade position doesn't lock, but no problem so far."
4,"Big improvement over older ""jigsaws""","I bought this quite some time ago when there was a special on it.Only in the last couple of weeks have I used it and WHAT A BIG IMPROVEMENT over the many years old one that I have been using.I love the blade lock that doesn't require a screwdriver to tighten a screw that on my old one that would need frequent attempts to re-tighten it and frequently damage the screwdriver slot.It's much easier to see where you're cutting with this design.The only negative is that the ""lock"" at the top front of the handle doesn't do anything. I didn't look at the manual to see but if it's like other electric tools that are made to protect you from yourself, it should be an interlock of some sort. It's not a big deal as I never had one on any old saws that I've had but it's probably a manufacturing defect.The only thing missing is a laser to help you cut more accurately, but that model was already sold out when I found this one on sale."
3,Too Clever By 537 Votes,"I enjoyed this book, but it's too clever by half. Milbank is a humorous and reasonably insightful political author, and he could have produced a great work on the 2000 campaign. Smashmouth's failings are less Milbank's fault than the fault of a churn-'em-out publishing culture that needs to race campaign books to the shelves before they're cooked. Basically, Smashmouth is just a recycling of Milbank's funny Washington Post columns from the campaign trail, wadded up and wrapped with a bit of flimsy conjunction. Besides creating a superficial and weak narrative, it also results in redundancy, as repeated puns (like ""JugGoreNaut"") that might bring a chuckle once a week are repeated again and again just pages apart."
3,Well written but that profound,I really liked reading this book but as I put it down for the last time I realized that there was really nothing in it that changed my life for the better or the worse. It has a lot of great stories but not a lot of substance. It is a good book but not a political classic.
1,MPIO = inferior,"I have had so many problems with my HD300, you wouldn't believe it! The software of this thing is incredibly buggy (so I've heard from friends, also about other MPIO products) and MPIO cannot be reached.Even if you have a guarantee, an MPIO guarantee is basically FAKE:MPIO ignores ALL customers' attempts to contact them!I'd AVOID MPIO products like THE PLAGUE; better buy something from the iriver brand!"
2,Shouldn't have bought this,"I was so excited at first when i opened the package of my mpio 20gb mp3 player. Documentation is bad and provides little information how to operate it properly. The unit almost always hangs when you touch the slider at once when shifting from radio to mp3 music. then i have to use a paper clip to reset and start again. But this erases my preset radio stations. Upgraded firmware didnt help also. Nice clear sounds though. Sturdy body. Nice blue backlight. Battery life too short. Got so annoyed about the constant hanging of the unit, that i sold it to someone and got myself an i-river H320 which can play videos, show photos, record radio or external source."
4,No problems,"Perhaps they listened to the previous review, but I've been using one of these extensively for two days and they work fine. The joint is smooth and causes no problem."
5,"Exciting New ""Tail"" from Jaques","I have been a Brian Jauqes devotee since I picked ""Redwall"" in fifth grade. Now,as a 21-year old college student, I still get excited when a new book in the series comes out.I agree that the last few books plots' have been formulaic, but ""Rakkety Tam"" breaks the mold and showcases the wonderful comraderie of Jaques' animal heros and villans in a fresh way. I partciularally enjoyed reading the good-natured banter between the squirrel Northerners Rakkety Tam and Doogy Plumm. They are interseting charcters and Jaques captures their accents down to a tee!""Rakkety Tam"" features more violent battles than in previous books, but they mirror the more violent battles going on in the world today.All in all, this book was a wonderful! I recomend it to anyone who is looking for a story to chuckle and and cheer over, no matter if they need a ""silent reading"" text for grade-school or are seeking a study-break from Mid-terms!"
5,Rakkety Tam!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great book. It's about two squirrels, Rakkety Tam Mcburl and Wild Doogy Plum.In their adventure they have to discover friend and foe and team up with freinds to defeat thier foe, the wild wolverine Gulo the Savage. It's by Brian Jacques. One of the reasons I read this book was because I liked the other books he wrote. (Ive' read them all)It's action packed and full of adventure."
3,Has Jacques Lost His Luster?,"It's sad but true: the 17th ""Redwall"" novel just isn't up to standard. Brian Jacques has made the mistake that so many authors before him have made as well: they get stuck in the same plot sequence when writing a series. Jacques just doesn't have any new material to offer here; indeed, it's more of the same old feasts, battles, etc. And while younger children will have no gripes with his yarn, older readers, especially those who have read his other novels, will be frustrated with the book's sheer predicatability. As a ""Redwall"" devotee myself, let me warn other fans of the series: brace yourselves for disappointment.Looking for other reliable children's book reviews? Visit www.freewebs.com/embryreviews for a wide range of literary critiques of novels for kids and teens."
5,This is a very good book for action.,This is a good book for friendships that are strong and will never split up. It is a great book with action and battles. If you like that stuff you would love this book.
1,Never received the product !,I never received the actual fuses. They broke my order into two orders. I received the fuse holder (order #1) but not the 2 fuses (order #2) I ordered. I wouldn't use these people again !
4,The sttory of the Real Bulldog,"If you are interested in the history of the Bulldog, want to know more about the recreated and natural breeds or just want a book full of great pictures then this is the book for you. Ken Mollet has not let his love for his own recreated Bulldogge breed ( the Victorian Bulldogge) interfere with his discussion of other Bulldogge and Bulldog breeds. A Great Book!!"
3,Blasphemies from the depths of Floridian Hell,"Not that they've forged any new weapons here, but KovZ prove that they are up to the task of tearing the faces off any Christians that dare to oppose them. Harking back to the unremitting black gods like Marduk and Dark Funeral, KovZ have little in the way of subtlety and plenty of unmitigated brutality. For those of you who seek the melodic breaks of a Dimmu or Emperor, you've come to the wrong house of Satan but should you crave the blasphemous and brutal, then the Kult is for you. Herein are nine songs that will smash the stained glass of churches for miles to come (and might even set them ablaze as well). I may not drive to this cd as it may cause me to do homicidal damage to others on the road, but when I need to unleash my inner blaspheming beast, I'll take Kult ov Azazel any day."
4,Good effort.,"Brutality and blasphemy. This is what this albums gives you when you pop the cd in the stereo.Harsh vocals and wicked riffs creates a certain melody and might i say,even catchy.Very fast and consistent double bass and again,catchy cymbals with some technical fills here and there, amazing drummer. Goodsound production and bass is pretty audible apart from their previous release.I cant deny from the fact when i listen to this album i can't help relating them with another black metal band ,marduk. I can hear some similarities between this album and Panzer Division Marduk altho marduk is more about war BM.One of the best USBM album of the year.Summing up if you like hateful blasphemic black metal you would pretty much like this album.Or if you are a fan of Marduk , you should check them out."
5,"This is rare, rare. Deserving of the double 5-star rating.","You see, Marcus Miller has always been a multi-track, multi-instrumentalist wunderkind on the level of Prince or Stevie Wonder--not many people were aware if this. Miles Davis was. David Sanborn was. Luther Vandross was. Ro Flack was--in fact, on this album Marcus recorded a cut Roberta used in the soundtrack to the Richard Pyror/Cicily Tyson vehicle ""Bustin' Loose"". ""Lovin' You"" has some thumping bass work I am still in awe of....and, no disrespect to Ms. Flack, Miller's version is 'way Phunkay. Marcus' vocals may not have been accepted back then--'83/'84--(I guess many fans were looking for the Vandross smoothness coming from the collaborator of many of Vandross's tunes)-- but to listen to Marcus on this album nowadays, his vocals are as compelling as anyone who's on the Top 10 list today especially on the slow jam ""Much Too Much"" and the title track ""Suddenly"". A rare treat for Marcus' jazz/funk fans."
2,Secret is not a cure all,Basically his secret is to rotate the toe of the club at impact for more yards. Entertaining pitch man but difficult swing to repeat and be consistent with.
5,"A wonderfully Bizarre, Eccentric Movie.....","Some people will fail to see the humor in this wonderfully bizarre, eccentric movie. How sad. Actually, it's a great film - where else can you see such spontaneously hysterical moments like someone dancing on the bar in electrified shoes? Or the funeral procession with the beer can cross.....the dog food factory.....the continual passing of gas....the list just goes on & on. It really made me laugh and laugh. I absolutely appreciated this example of good cinema and it's definately one I'll watch again, probably laughing even harder the next time & the time after that. It's hysterical - I loved it."
4,Another Great Film,"Yet another great film from the director of ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"". There are too many ""laugh-out-loud"" moments in this movie to mention. Loved It!!!!!!!"
4,Australian comedy,"I continue to enjoy the movies that have been coming out of the land of OZ! Welcome to Woop Woop is another classic Australian film, filmed in the great outback, the movie takes you on a wild adventure as an American becomes tangled with a hyperactive Australian woman who takes the American home to met her family. The American finds himself in a bazzare camp run by the womans father. They hold him prisoner until the American marries their daugter, he is reluctant to do so. The story continues with fun, and adventure... The movie is well worth viewing. I loved the strange content of this movie and recommend seeing it."
4,Loved it,"This movie was on one morning at about 3am. I watched it and thought, what the hell am i watching. I have watched it everything it has come on since. I am a New Yorker and this is the furthest you will get the east coast. It is bizzare, weird and hilarious. I even cried. Watch it. You will love it."
4,It's about time it came out on DVD!,"This is a great movie, but I'm not a critic and I'll leave that to others. Although the description doesn't mention it, this is an anamorphic 16 x 9 version of the movie. Quality is not quite as good as some movies that have been digitally remastered, but for the most part pretty clean and without a doubt better than any other version available. One problem...the disc is flawed at approximately 57:30 into the picture for a couple of minutes. I sent my first one back and got a replacement, but it was flawed in the same place. Amazon paid shipping on both discs and then credited my purchase price after I returned the second one with a message describing the problem (can't complain about service like that!), stating that their inventory was likely all that way. I'm waiting a while, then I'll reorder."
3,Comedy,"An absolutely nutty movie from the Aussies. It is ""Sound of Music"" on mescalene. I laughed my butt off. It is about as far out as you can get.A lot of weird fun here.........a real gem but only if you are in the mood."
1,Poor quality,"The quality of this DVD was exremely poor. The picture was blurry and, in the middle of the movie stopped all together. It looked as if someone had recorded from a low-grade VCR tape directly to the DVD."
3,Wild and Yummy,"Johnathon Schaech is too cute for his own good, and every frame of this film seems to dwell on some part of his unbelievable body. He is as hot as the Australian Outback. The film itself is fun and twisted, nothing laugh-out-loud but a lot of eye candy. Be sure to catch the cameo by none other than Tina Louise in the first scene."
3,WOOP WOOP ON DVD AT LAST!,"I have been waiting for a LONG while to see ""Welcome To Woop Woop"" (from Australia) to be avaiable on DVD - though I love that it IS on DVD, this HAS to be a bootleg copy. It has no menu page; just starts into film, and no media inserts in folder - the snap folder is flawed as well and does not close as it is bowed at its center. Not sure how this particualr product ended up on Amazon.com - but I'll take it at this desperate stage in the WOOP WOOP DVD waiting game."
4,FUN MOVIE!,"So glad this is out on DVD, played fine on my Blu-Ray, only negative– it was not authored with chapters, so no skipping around, never seen that on any disc, PLAY movie is all that is available. This movie is a hoot and gets 5 stars for wacky, wierd, funny entertainment."
3,Pros and Cons,"The book associates Brown's choices in scripture with parts of speeches/writtings by Graham. The problem is the scripture does not always relate to the Graham segment, so it is confusing and non-supportive. The best part of the book is Graham's commentary. It would be a lot better if the scriptures matched his thoughts."
4,Funny,Very funny book that my friend's would like. I will let them know to read it in school. The pictures were very good.
1,Do not buy the Kindle version for your iPad!,I bought this for my daughter who loved Hot Dog in print. The Kindle version is basically a bad set is scans...terrible and disappointing.
2,Kindle Edition Disappointing,"We have a number of books in this series in paperback and love them. So I thought I would download a few for my Kindle app for IPad for an upcoming road trip. So disappointing! The pages are nothing but mediocre color scans of the book, and you can even see prominent center seem lines! The text is too small to read comfortably, and, very confusingly for a new reader, the title of the book appears at the top of every page, as if it were a novel. I am going to ask for my money back, and think twice before downloading any children's books again. This translated so poorly. I hope the technique may improve in time because the iPad would be a great medium for children's books when traveling."
1,horrible word selection for beginners,"This book had terrible word selection for a level 1 book for the beginning reader. Here is a sampling of words in the book: Sprinkly, wrinkly, scratchy, patchy, lappy, licky, howly, growly.Seriously - many of the words were not even real words! This was very frustrating as a parent watching my early reader try to sound out words that are not even real. Does NOT instill confidence! Does NOT enhance word recognition! It was a nice topic (dogs), and short sentences (2-4 words) - but when half the words are pseudo-words, it really misses the point of introductory reading books. I would NOT recommend this book to an early reader in the least."
3,Not a good read for kids.,"Even though this book was fun for ME too read to my son. I really don't encourage this for begginer readers. Not alot of sight words and only brought on fustration. Other wise all the ""scroufy"" dogs are cute."
5,Great video for learning phonics!,"I have used this video with my 5 year old son. It keeps his attention and focuses on teaching: 1. the letter, 2. the sound it makes, 3. the lip movement the sound makes, and 4. a word and picture of the word item. I just let him watch short segments at a time! (And of course, review that segment over and over!) It has a couple of ""games"" for the children to watch and respond to. Excellent video!"
4,"My Son Loves This Video - a review of ""Rock 'N Learn Letter Sounds","My son who just turned 4 y.o. loves this video. Like the homeschool mom we got this at the library, and like her we found it really engages our children. (My daughter is almost 6.)The video begins with the letters of the alphabet in sequence: capital and lower cases and sounds. It then goes on to mix the letters up, first showing the letters and giving children the time to say what the letters sounds are before telling them if they don't know. In a following segment, the video gives sentences such as ""An alligator and an ant add apples"". Children are supposed to shout out what the 'target' letter is. In this case ""a"".Four Stars. A nice supplement to the LeapFrog videos (which we also love)."
2,Disappointing,"This is a very disappointing video. In its defense though I am comparing it to Leap Frog's Letter and Talking Word factory videos which are streets ahead of this one. If you are only going to buy one basic letter sound video, buy the Letter Factory from Leap Frog. My children can watch the Letter Factory 3 times in a row but have yet to watch this one from beginning to end. They become very bored by this one."
2,hmmmmm its ok,well i was waiting for my laser tag set to arrive (it took dayz!)i got over it soon wen i got it i invited over a friend but wefound i hard to play in the light so we had to wait hours to become the night wen it was nighttime we immediately shut the lights and started all around the house until the we got are pant scared off from a reflection the we tripped! over a lamp cord. that waz not fun at all so we taped flashlights to the side of the guns. that worked so we played we wondered why no laser tag set does not have a headlight?????????
2,Not a good toy,"I got this for my birthday and it worked for a couple of hours, and then it stoped working. We took it back and got another one. It didn't work either. We went back and got another one and that one finally worked (it doesn't work now though!) We also bought one for our friends birthday, so that we could play laser tag with them, and it too ended up not working. We took it back and got another one, which worked then but doesn't work now. We also tried the Laser Challenge Radar Extreme (it's made by Toymax too) and it didn't work. DON'T BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER LASER TAG PRODUCT TOYMAX MAKES!!"
3,Its ok,"This toy is not good.The first week u have it, it is fun to play with. I bought 2 sets and played at night w/ my friends and had a blast.After about a week they stopped working.I do not reccomend this toy."
1,Why can't I find a Toymax toy that works!,"After returning the laser paintball set that didn't work I picked up the laser challenge neutralizer. I must say this toy was a Blast! untill...three hours later it just quit working and that was under very light use. After two sets of Toymax products in just two days, I definitely cannot recommend this brand to anyone. I'm going to try the laser tag brand instead."
4,Very fun,"I am 14 years old. I ordered this product but I recieved a totally different one. It is a small pistol but it is still very fun. Didn't work very good at all when outside during the day. I could barly shoot my friend from 5 feet away. When it is dark the product works excellently. I played for 4 hours strait with my friends. I bought two boxes and all 4 work perfectly fine with eachother, and they are durable. When I get more money I will probably buy another set. I would recommend this to others of all ages."
4,3m hookit backup pad,"I haven't used this one yet but the last one I had worked very well, the reason I didn't give it 5 start was I only used a couple of times and then didn't use it for a couple of years and when I went to use it it started to come apart, it may have been my fault because I left it in the garage where gets pretty hot during the summer, this time when I finish using it I'm going to try putting it in a zip-locbag and keep in where its air conditioning so time will tell."
3,"Cute set, but.....","My oldest daughter bought this as a gift for my youngest. The set is fairly small. The colors are lovely and the pieces are nice, although one had a sharp piece of glaze on it.Unfortunatly, the basket is very poorly made. It fell apart within 30 minutes of owning. What a shame."
2,liliputin tea set,disappointing. It was too small to actually use. cheap plastic held the items. Once the items were removed there was no way to secure the items in the basket for future storage. The basket and teapot items were nice but way too small. the spoons were not in proportion
5,Mountains Of Marvelous Mouthfuls,The dishes are so delightful and simple that many people will find themselves making over and over again.Lots of English favorites and lots of fun selections that even the kids will be begging for more...which doesn't happen much in our house! Delighfully put together.Ainsleys flamboyent flavors will please every palate.
5,Ainsley does it again!,I love Ainsley Harriott. His cookbooks are no nonsense get to the cooking and have fun cookbooks. The recipes are clear and simple to follow and the results are wonderful. The recipes in this book are quick. Your family will be surprised when they see how fast you can whip up delish meals!
4,"Easy to follow instructions, some rather good recipes","I am somewhat of a cookbook collector, but when I first started this was one of the first cookbooks I ever bought, and it did serve its purpose - which was to teach me how to cook some proper satisfying meals. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, and the ingredients are very easy to get a hold of if you live in the UK. Although some recipes are really uninspired and plain, some really do their job well and are regulars on our dinner ""menu"" at home. Good cookbook for beginning cooks or amateurs..."
3,"So, so recipes.","I've tried a few of these recipes. Yes, they're easy to prepare. No, they're not the best recipes I've ever tried. The ones that I've tried were bland and uninspired."
1,Dry Dry and More dry,"I had this history book the first semester of my freshman year in college and let me tell you, it is a very dry book. There is a lot of unnecessary information and all the little details make it even worse. Also, some of the information is dusty while some of the points the author points out are very arguable and seem untrue. Once again, this is a very dry book."
3,Nipt it Nip it Nip it!,"A mostly topical but fairly good history of the man behind the badge. I was disappointed there were no interviews with Mr. Knotts himself throughout the entire video although there were kind words from Opie, Andy, Tim Conway, Knotts' children and his former wives. I never knew Barney was such a ladies man(two wives 1/2 his age!!) A good buy for the Knotts collector, but make sure you have The Private Eyes in your collection first..."
4,"Works just as described, but overheats!","I had to replace my original charger b/c I tried to use it overseas, and realized (after it was too late), that it doesn't handle 220V. Well, after searching online, and having virtually every link redirect me to Amazon, I purchased this replacement.The charger works fine. It charges my beard trimmer to full capacity, and looks and works as intended. However, I do notice that it overheats a LOT! I usually recharge approx. every 2 weeks, b/c I let the battery drain completely. I charge it up during the night, and it's good to go. However this charger, every single time, has been very HOT to the touch, and the actual bread trimmer also gets very hot.Other than that, it works great!"
1,the 60s are dead and this book proves it,"Leafing through and then reading this book at length, I had to laugh. One particularly amusing and typical account was of RH's finding symbolic significance in an ancient Israeli fort's similarity to Close Encounters of the Third Kind's movie set. Man I get high just thinking about it. I just want to unread history, numb my powers of critical thinking, and go live in a patchouli-scented yurt when this otherwise amazing, astounding musician dumbs us down this way. Ah, to be like a child again: self-centered, uneducated (as the other reviewer put it) and able to lovingly turn the pages of this book without ever aging and having to learn from experience. The sad fact is that by extolling the virtues of childlikeness in this book, Mr. Havens censors the brain itself."
3,How did the first four tracks get past security?,"If you buy this CD, save yourself the time and trouble and skip right to tracks five or six. The first four tracks are terrible! The album definetly picks up with ""I feel love"" and ends with the awesome track ""heaven scent"". Overall I gave this album three stars. An album with only the first four tracks would get zero stars and an album with only the last four tracks would get five+ stars. I would buy this album only for the last four tracks, even though the first half of the CD just about ruins the whole thing."
3,could be much better,"While I agree this is the best available source right now on Delano and Aldrich, the book has some major problems. I especially do not like the fact that you need to search three different parts of the book for photographs and images of any particular project: color photos grouped at the start of the book, then small images alongside the main text, and then larger black and white photographs grouped at the end of the book."
5,anti McMansions,"Delano and Aldrich were remarkable architects whose achievements include the Dutch Reformed Church in Brookville, LI Oheka, the largest home in the country, Willard Straight Hall at Cornell and other buildings too numerous to mention which you probably count amont your favorites whether or not you know about architecture. The photos and text of this book show their range and informs about the kindly and sophisticated personalities of the men."
1,a bait and switch,"this book was so disappointing that i had no doubt 5 minutes after i looked through it that i would return it.from the cover, i expected a book rich in color photographs of elegant interiors -- in +addition+ to the historical black and whites.there are a measley handful of color photos, all placed at the very beginning of the book before the book even gets underway (before chapters, just after the intro, something like that).what a bait and switch!there are enough existing delano and aldrich structures to have procured colored photos -- whether existing or comissioned explicitly for this book.the black and white photos also disappoint a bit.caveat lector -- i have not read the book, as its use to me was at least 50% in part a pictoral guide. it may be of some value for those who can forgive it its pictoral faults."
4,Easy to use,Just make sure you lightly grease all surfaces of the mold before pouring the hard candy in. I had some tips that didn't come out very clean because I hadn't greased well enough in the corners.
5,Great DVD!,Love his DVD! Some real great videos on here. Great value! I would recommend this to any hard rock/metal fan.
1,What Is This?,"I, too, would like to know what videos are in this collection. How does Amazon expect to sell this item when there's no description of the contents? It might be a great video collection or it might really stink. How is the customer supposed to know?"
4,Simply amazing...Simply entertaining...Simply ALYSSA...,"There are no words to describe the beauty of Alyssa Milano. She has a presence that just captures your heart. She is like an angel... on screen, on T.V., and even on a music CD. Her soft voice sounds so sweet, but at the same time it's also srong and full of compassion. She is simply amazing. Even though Alyssa is fantastic in this album, I had to give it four stars because of its style. Don't get me wrong I think it's fine, but it was put out in nineteen eighty-nine. And the music industry has really changed in ten years. But hey,...It's Alyssa Milano singing,...so if you're a fan of Alyssa's, or if you like late eighties soft rock, I would definitely purchase her first album. My favorite songs are, STEP BY STEP, DESTINY, BE MY BABY, WE NEED THE CHILDREN. Although they're all good. JAMES R. SPAIN"
3,Great 80's collection!,"And well, that’s about it. She is not a Rocker Chick like Ann Wilson or even Debra Gibson for that matter. But I still think since she was about at the peek of her teen stardom back in the late 80's (I think the Alyssa One album was recorded back in the latter months of 1988.) this album could have at least been certified gold in America; although she really was performing songs too electronic instrumentally and very little emphasis on dynamic rhythm both vocal and instrumental.But I have to say she was for real as being a singer, and the song ""Tell me that you love me"" proves just that. Of course that’s really no surprise since she got her start from the theatrical play “Annie”."
1,Pass On By...,"I was curious about her music once I found out she had actually sang...This is awful! She has a pretty voice I will give her credit for that, but some of the lyrics sound rushed and not at all going with the beats and or time of music. I believe had she slowed down her singing and not rushed it on some songs, they might have sounded good.BLAH! Don't buy this unless you are tone deaf!!!"
4,I LOVED IT,"I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF SOFTROCK, OR LOVE SONGS BUT I REALLY ENJOYED LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM AND PLAN ON PURCHING HER OTHER ALBUMS IN THE FUTURE. I THINK THAT SHE HAS A VERRY STRONG VOICE. I LIKED HER REMAKE OF BE MY BABY. I WISH SHE WOULD RELEASE HER ALBUMS IN THE STATES."
2,Not that good.,Not a very good workout. Very weak. I would recommend another video. Does not work up much of a sweat.
5,car parts,"I was surprised to find the exact car part that I needed to stop the oil leak in my car. My mechanic wanted $144 to buy the part from him and install it in my car. I was able to use my points to pay for the part, all but about a dollar. My son was able to install it free of charge. My total cost including shipping, was about $6 and the oil leak is fixed. I saved $138!"
4,Fairly handy,"Bought 08/07. This chuck is mega stout. And will grip the crap out of anything. I even use it for some weird looking ashtrays, made from the cut corner pieces left over from rounding off a bowl blank with a chainsaw. Works like a charm. A 3-jaw is nothing you want to learn chuck turning on however. A 4-jaw is much safer and holds the piece more securely. But this one accomidates irregular shaped pieces better. If you have a good catch with this chuck, you will have a spinning piece of wood airborne in your shop. Be careful. If you have a gentle touch with your tools, this chuck is plenty safe. If you know what you are doing, and would like to utilize the advantages of a big heavy 3-jaw chuck, then you can't do much better than this. It's high weight helps your lathe speed from slowing at all while you are working on a nearly finished, light weight bowl. Idk, it still feels like there is alot of mass under the chisel tip."
1,Not worth it!,"I was unable to use this item. Everything I scooped up went right back through. I purchased a small fish net that cost 88 cent that works wonderful! I did wash the scoop very well and gave it to my son to play in the sand, so it wasn't a complete loss!"
2,OK,"this product wasn't that helpful for my crabs because the ""stuff"" that i scooped just went right through the holes and back in to the cage"
2,About Worthless,"This product is worthless. As everyone said, the smaller ""stuff"" just falls through. The scoop is fine for picking up pieces of food scattered around, but worthless for droppings. Think I'll try the fishnet that was suggested by another reviewer. In short, don't waste your money unless you have big crabs!"
1,"If you want poop in your terrarium, buy this.","I would scoop and my hermit crabs' poop would fall right through. This is crap. If you want something that actually works, get a fish net and use that to sift through all the nasty stuff in your terrarium. It's a bit more tedious and time consuming, but it does an exquisite job."
1,waste of money,"Worked fine for two days then started getting disk error. Tried CDs, DVDs etc. none worked but they all worked fine in my old dvd player. I returned and currently rethinking what I should buy as replacement."
1,Garbage,"I hardly had used this system, was still shiny & new and it just stopped working. It would play for 10 minutes and shut off. I would never buy a product from this company again."
2,I liked it but broke within a year,After ten months the CD/DVD changer stopped working. Otherwise I would have liked this product.
1,would give it a ZERO if I could,"Bought this home theatre system a little over a year ago, but used it for about 10 months (because i was finishing the room I used it in). After about 9 months of use the front display went out. Upon contacting Samsung, they told me it would be $160 to fix that. About 2 weeks later the entire unit stopped working. Unfortunately even though I had only used it for 10 months, since I bought it over a year ago Samsung said there was nothing they could do to replace it. $160 to fix a system that was used less than a year and I only paid about $250 to begin with. Don't waste your money on this overgrown paperweight!"
1,NO!,"Dont be cheap like i was, spend the extra 100-200 bucks and get a better system. This worked good for 3 months and then the sound just got worse and worse.....im going for the oknoyo system.. wish me luck!"
1,FAILED,"FM Radio was very low volumn, 2 seperate people at different times tried to set it up and failed. Both of these people were experienced and so am I."
3,Great at everything BUT....,"This is a revised review which I would give this system 4.5/5. Previosly I stated that it would not play backup movies, but it turns out that my software need it an update, and now they work perfectly. The only drawback to this system in the lack of inputs. YOu might have to do like I did and buy a 3 input HDTV/optical switch to be able to use more that one optical input source. I highly recommend buying the wireless module for the rear surround speakers."
2,Not real happy with this,When it works its a nice player. I use it for audio books but i have had to replace it twice in a year because the hard drive has gone out. It some times gets buggy and you have to reformat. I would not buy another one.
1,bla for bach,"I have to agree with other viewers, who are dissapointed in the video itself.The music is quite good, though not my favorite interpretation of the Bach suites. However, when it comes time to hear the piece, we don't even see Yo-yo playing. We see him pretending to play, while the camera does all these tricks that in the end make us more motion-sick than anything.Quite a dissapointment - are the other volumes this bad?"
1,Promote a philosophy or show pretentious art sale job!!!,"Yoyo Ma's musical talent is marvelous.Unfortunately the music is just the background noise in this DVD! Pity!This DVD shows a talent been exploited in a senseless way. In desperation to market himself (via Bach) as a philosopher and rescuer of the modern chaos cities' parks! He is quite famous now. May be the eternal and universal fame is what he is after! His companion (what is her name again?) and the (city) politicians had shown the best part of the worse pretentious people. If you want to watch these things, do not bother to buy this DVD, turn on the TV or go to political compaigns. Other things around his performace makes me downgrade this DVD to one star (cannot go lower in this review board).This review sounds senseless. This DVD is that senseless.Oh no. People may be curios and buy this DVD! This could be the only reason make this DVD as popular as ""The temptation of Christ"".Music lovers and Yoya Ma's fan better not see this DVD."
5,Hold me now...,"There were these songs that I always liked in the 80's. It wasn't until Christmas 2005 that I found out that the songs (In the Name of Love, Doctor! Doctor! Lies) were performed by the Thompson Twins. So, I bought one of their ""Greatest Hits"" collections and re-discovered them, for myself.Now, the reason for my purchase of the 12-inch Collection. Normally, I try my best to avoid buying an album for ""one song."" However, I've always longed for an extended version of ""Hold Me Now."" Clocking in at 9:45, the song, in my opinion, is pure gold! So, do I regret spending $20/US for this disc? In a word, NO! Save up some cash, and purchase this collection! You will NOT BE SORRY!! Five stars!"
3,A cool little gift...,"My friends and I all bought this ""Invisible Ink Pen Set."" It came in a smaller box than expected and didn't have the quality product we were hoping for. It still worked quite well and served it's purpose. I guess that is what you get for five dollars!?!?"
5,How can it get any better?!?,"The only thing I don't like about this cd is the limited number of tracks...there are so many more greatest hits they can put on!But, I guess they won't all fit on the disc. That's alright because what is on this famous Christian Rock Band's album is out of this world. I haven't even bought it yet and I know it's great because I know these songs forwards and backwards (besides the two new ones of course). I have every single type of album...from singles to remixes, audio adrenaline has ever produced, and they just keep getting better and better. If you have never heard of this band or don't know some of these songs, you must get this album. Their music is so full of rock-life and stays so true to their Master's touch. With this band you won't get stars, showbiz, in-it-for-the-money feeling from their music...you'll get what God is doing in their lives. How can music get any better than that?"
5,I Have Nothing else to say...,"Well, hello, these are Audio A hits, of course its gonna rock the house.Stuart, Burkum McGinniss, Cissell, and Herdman will keep you rockin'. So, I just won't say anything else..."
5,The Best of the Best!,"I can't believe I have been listening to my favorite band long enough for them to have a ""greatest hits"" album; how do we get so old so fast??? You're never to old to check out this great collection of all the best of Audio A. There are few CD's you can listen to all the way through and love (or at least like) every song on it, and this is one of them. Great for Audio A fans and new listeners who want to try them out."
2,"Good Cover, No Meat","What a waste of time. I wanted to learn about the founding of America, instead I am force-fed moronic ""professors"" obviously chosen for their willingness to say stupid things. One said he was surprised the Founding Fathers were able to function because they were so drunk, using about four different descriptive slang terms rather than ""intoxicated."" Another said that John Adams was a candiate for Prozac and implied that the first child he had with his wife may have been illegitimate despite being born 9-10 months after the wedding (married in October, baby born in July).I am so sick of the tripe A&E and the History Channel release. The History Channel used to seem more legitimate than A&E, now it's just the same nonsense. Something calling itself ""The HISTORY Channel"" should do more than try to revise it.Don't waste your money."
5,entertaining and educational,We had about 20 people over for a dinner and decided to put this on. Everyone stayed and watched it till the end. A very good sign that it was done well
5,Excellent,"I think I like this even better than ""Founding Brothers"". Just as good and informative and enjoyable. Good lesson in history."
1,Embarrassing,"I had watched this an was sickened by the way they spoke of various sexual crimes of the founding fathers, the shear arrogance at dragging out founding fathers through the mud. I also wonder about the legitimacy of these videos, why is this information just getting out? how are they able to keep finding such terrible things about our founding fathers when few people to none knew about it back then. As an American I am embarrassed that such things would be said about our Founders. If you have time check out the link on the history channel [...]"
2,Disappointing,The patterns are uninspired so having the CD to this book does no good.The palettes are okay however I thinkPattern and Palette Sourcebook 2: A Complete Guide to Choosing the Perfect Color and Pattern in DesignandPatterns and Palette Sourcebook: A Complete Guide to Choosing the Perfect Color and Pattern in Designhave much better.Although the two aforementioned do not have vector files included on their CDs.
3,marginal,Thought this would be a decent belt for the money. The bump from the seam was a big annoyence and the belt wore faster than it should have. I will not buy any more of these.
2,The author works for Chavez!,"Eva Gollinger did not obtain ""secret"" anything. She requested them as part of a Freedom of Information Act request, and in an open society as ours, she received them. If you google her name, you will see that she is not an ""independent international"" anything. She works for the Chavez administration! Don't be fooled by this attempt to manipulate public opinion by a sworn enemy of the United States."
1,Two radios in and Neither one works!!,"We ordered this toy for our daughter. When it arrived, it did not work (right out of the package)!! So we called. Kaplan answered right away by sending us a replacement radio- which we were very happy about although it took about a month.So the second radio faired a bit better. We used it for about 3 weeks until this morning- nothing, ziltch, nada....once again, it does not work. I have now asked for a full refund since I cannot put my daughter though another session of ""will it work or not"".I would venture to say that this radio does NOT live up to any expectation we had and has left my daughter very dissappointed."
1,disappointed,"This product is damaged. I used the player twice with my son and now the cd will skip to the last song. The hole where you would plug in the microphone is empty, therefore, the plug falls out. I am very disappointed with this product. I threw the box away before I realized that the player was damaged or else I would send the player back for a new one."
2,Look for something else,"I got this for my son new off of eBay a couple years ago after having trouble finding a suitable kids' player in the stores. It worked for a little while, but would easily skip the cd back to the beginning if you so much as looked at it wrong. Pretty awful it doesn't have anti-skip protection for being a kids' product. Especially if they want to carry it around or sing to a cd or something. I got him another brand and we kept this just to use with the microphone. I recently broke it out again for my younger son and found that it would only play a cd to about the 4th song and then just stop playing. Don't know why Fisher Price stopped making their Tuff Stuff cd player. I found that one used on eBay after buying this and it has worked fantastically since purchasing. I'll probably end up donating this headache to a good will or something. Really...shop around and find something else. It might look like what you are looking for, but it is really a poor quality player."
1,Not so great,"I got this item for my son's birthday and it did work for about a week. Then the speakers started to sound like they were blown, even though I played it at a reasonable volume. After 2 months of having it, it plays half a cd then there is an error message and the machine stops working. I would have preferred a regular cd player as opposed to a cd player that has the colors to appeal to a child. For the price paid, I think a regular cd player would do a better job."
1,Rip Off!,Thank goodness Grandma and Grandpa checked this out before giving it as a Christmas present. We would have had two disappointed little girls. Could Kick ourselves for not reading the reviews that said the player never worked right out of the box! Ours never worked. Do not order this made in China product!!!
2,Waste of $$$,"Bought this item for Christmas. The CD player broke after a couple months. Music is crucial for bedtime routine, so was very disappointed and frantic to replace. Do not waste your money!"
1,don't waste your money,"I ordered three of these for my granddaughters. And two of them doesn't work. Sorry piece of @#*&! I am glad I tried them out before Christmas. Hope I can get my money back. I did not order them from amazon, from an other site."
3,Baby Juke,This works great and is tough enough for my rowdy four year old grandson but the microphone doesn't work or do anything. He still loves playing CDs and singing with it though.
3,"Okay, but should be improved","When I heard about the Tenchi in Tokyo series was coming on toonami, I was glad. Unfortunely, My happiness turned into a huge disappointment. All of the key elements have been stripped away. Now instead of a good story and cool characters, we get a lame story and subpar characters. The animation is okay, but Tenchi Muyo and Tenchi Universe are leagues better. The voice acting has changed dramatically. Now instead of Noboyuki somewhat hilarious voice, we get a nerdy voice. Also, since when do both Kiyone and Mihosi like Tenchi? Tenchi Universe made a lot more sense than this, and I like to add that the main villian, Yugi, is not my idea of a bad guy. At least Kagato was a cool villian. This is not a bad series(it still maintainds that quirky sense of humor) but could have been improved."
3,A New Start,"This series is definitely not as good as the others mainly cause of the animation but some of the stories are stupid.The first episoded was ok and you don't have to see Tenchi meet all of the girls AGAIN untill later.The story was boring and the animation was bad.The second episode was better and had a nice story between Sakuya and Tenchi and there were some romantic scenes too.The third was sooo bad the whole ""destroy long distance relationships"" was so stupid and what the hell happened to Ryo ohki.The last episode was really good and again focused on Tenchi and Sakuya and it was quite nice animation to.If your a fan you have probably already brought this but I would just buy the important episodes on volume 5,7 and 8 and save the money to buy the Tenchi movies which are A LOT better. :)"
3,What the...,"To tell you the truth...i love Tenchi muyo! It is by far the greatest anime series that I have seen. But Tenchi in Tokyo is very iffy. It has a feel that it's for children. I'm used to the OVA and Universe and all that. Even though I have only seen the first four episodes, it feels like the story is very different. Does Tenchi still have his Jurai powers??? Does he still have contact with his light hawk sword?? Even though this is a Tenchi series, I'm leaving it at 3 stars. Man...what's going on here?"
3,Shin Tenchi Muyo!,"Shin Tenchi Muyo! (Tenchi in Tokyo) isn't exactly my favorite anime in the world. Don't get me wrong here, I absolutely loved the OAV and the first TV series. However, the animation here is subpar and the characters are somewhat--non appealing. The storyline is different and so is the fact on how the girls came to Earth. Typically, the animators were cursed--the faces are completely weirder than the other series and the eyes are so ugly! They should have taken their time, because it seems like they rushed. Also, they need to revise their new characters, especially Sakuya Kumashiro. She is somewhat of a nuisance after you hear her voice over and over again in your head. The humor is still there. I laughed my head off when the girls go off to Tokyo in search for yen. Even if the DVD wasn't what I expected, it will still have a place on my shelf."
3,Don't Call This A Sequel,"A New Start is a fitting name for this disc, since it has no relation whatsoever to any of the previous Tenchi story lines. Much like the Tenchi Universe series, Tenchi In Tokyo is yet another radical retelling of the same story. And like Tenchi Universe, Tenchi In Tokyo really pales in comparison to the original and still the best OAV series. Although it falls short of living up its OAV heritage, it's not a bad series by any stretch of the imagination. It's still fun and goofy, but it lacks polish and scale that made people gravitate to Tenchi in the first place. Thankfully, there's the manga out there to continue the original story line."
3,"it ok, but not as good","I really liked the anime and was impressed with the first two series of Tenchi, but when I saw Tenchi in Tokyo I was a little shocked. The atmosphere, characters, and animation has changed drasticly and for the worse. It looks more like sailor moon with its wierd animations showing sadness, anger, ect. Its definatlely more for a different, younger audience."
3,"""Fun,"" but not as pretty as the movies.","My girlfriend is addicted to the Tenchi Muyo series; we have so far seen all of the movies, but none of the OAV series.These episodes, from the TV series, are much lighter in tone than the movies, with the ""wackiness ensues"" aesthetic that informs titles such as Ranma 1/2.The art is (obviously) not as impressive as in the various movies, but the plot is enjoyable, even if there are a few too many cliffhangers. If you are already a Tenchi fan, you may very well want to buy (or rent) this; otherwise you probably should start with one of the movies, ""Tenchi Muyo in Love"", or ""The Daughter of Darkness""."
5,Glad I bought before I viewed it!,The only knowledge of Tenchi was from the first tape of the OAv series that a friend had bought and everthing he told me about the series. But so far from the first day I got it I've watched it once each day for the next Five days! And it is as good as any that I have seen before
3,Techi in Tokyo not as good as OAV or TV Series.,"The Tenchi in tokyo isn't as good as the OAV or the TV series. The art work is subpar and It seem that the whole Vol. 1 focus on how Ryoko and Ayeka fighting, which is too much. But the Idea of tenchi going to Tokyo is good."
1,"Faye Dunaway, that's about it....","I won't bore you with the plot writing, it's mainstream, and it's so convoluted it makes little to no sense. I will say that the photography was grand. The cinematography and camera angles were thoughtful and overtly artistic and pleasing. The film used puts one in mind of ""Dolores Claiborne"" in the way Taylor Hackford utilized the darker film in the more ""depressive"" scenes. Dunaway is superb, as usual. She's convincing and isn't given enough screen time. I'm surprised she took this film, to be honest, it doesn't give her much highlight. She's wonderful, the rest of the cast is so-so. This film shows that without a great foundation, the script, ANY film will flop. Run, don't walk, from this mix of words and sentences. There is no beginning and no end to this horribly written film."
4,Won't be able to put it down,"This is definately a one sit read. Very idealistic, but in an age where all political stories seem to feel the need to add cynisism in the name of realism, its nice to read a book by a DC native that can make you smile as well as think a little. From bikers in the Capitol to a Cabinet formed from the masses; for two hours of your time, its well worth it."
3,Pretty Good,"This is a fairly typical good cop/bad cop show. The storyline itself is nothing special.Like so many of this genre, it is set in New York City. It features Ray Tierney (Edward Norton) as an experienced cop who has been on kind of a light duty status since a traumatic episode in which he had been injured. His father, Francis Tierney Sr. (Jon Voight) is the city's chief of detectives. Francis Jr. (Noah Emmerich) and brother-in-law Jimmy (Colin Farrell) round out the multi-generational police family.Ray is assigned by his father Francis to investigate a case where four police officers were killed. As he looks into it, he finds that there are some corrupt cops involved including family members. The conflicts and ugliness are all brought to the surface.The performances by Norton and Farrell are very good. Voight is outstanding as always. This is really probably 3-1/2 stars. It is one that will keep viewers engaged."
2,The violence was traumatizing,This movie included incredibly intense violence. At least one scene included horrifying threats to an infant. I have seen better corrupt cop movies that did not leave me feeling like I need to vomit. This movie gave me nightmares.
3,Good story about a police family,Edward Norton vs Collin Farrell. Good cop vs bad cop. Good story line and great acting by many actors. Kind of predictable but still a good movie.
5,Sidney Lumet can be proud...,"A story of a family, of betrayal, corruption and violence. A story of New-York, a hard boiled mood and desperate measures. A very good film, take a look at the making of and see what it's like for a director to give birth to a masterpiece against the storm."
1,problem with disc,the sound was very low when I played this dvd.Tired all 3 of my players.The same on all.I should have returned it but I put up with it.
1,bad,"I cant believe ed norton would pick such a plot. The movie dragged on forever. You find out who the bad cops are from the beginning and it takes ed till the end to bring them down, it was so obvious who was involved and how easy it would have been to stop them with one phone call."
3,"FAMILIAR STORY, BUT BETTER THAN AVERAGE CRIME DRAMA! 3 1/2 STARS!","'Pride and Glory' may not be the most original crime drams, but because of a decent cast, it is worth seeing. The film is a bit long, but does hold your interest. The story is a bit muddled in places and it does seem ""by the numbers"" in spots, but overall it's better than the average bear. I know there has been some flack regarding a scene using a baby as a tool to get information, but this was one of the most impressive scenes in the film and it showed just how ruthless these guys can be to get what they want. It's only a movie people and I'm sure no infants were harmed during the making of this film.If you like police drama, you'll like this and there is enough acting talent to keep most film lovers interested."
3,pride an glory,"Way, Way, Way too much cussing. I got so sick and tired of the ""f"" word. I don't think that they were able to complete a full sentence without saying that word over and over and over. Like I said ...way too much cussing. The movie had a great storyline and exceptional actors."
3,left wanting more,this move had a good idea but it left me wanting more.the ending killed the entire movie for me and i just think they could have wrapped up things a little better. i would have rated this moive higher but some of the plot was just to far out there.in the end i did like the action though
2,Reality TV in a refrigerator,"An NYPD drama in an Irish cop family, with Voight, Farrell, Norton? That sounded promising, so I sat down in the refrigerated room that Singapore calls a cinema and watched with amazement what the cinematographically illiterate producers and directors offered me.The story is probably ok and could have made me stay put, but the amateurish story-telling drove me out of the cold into the tropical night within half an hour. I have occasionally watched a few minutes of American crime reality TV, where reporters accompany cops in busts or arrests. The sound and visual quality of those productions have the excuse of being improvised, unplannable. The movie doesn't have that excuse. It is far worse than most youtube films that I have ever seen.Rest in peace!"
4,"Good cast, good story, but slow pacing.","This film maybe cliched, but it's very well done. However, the language is rather persistant, and the violence is rather intense. The good cop/bad cop storyline has been done before, and I've seen it, but not quite like this.Because of this film, I have newfound respect for Edward Norton-I never hated him, but here he's very good, Jon Voight once again does a very nice job, but Colin Farrell is a little too easy to hate-esp. with what he does to a foreign family. Very little about this film is predictable, however it doesn't take long to realize the plot involves corruption w/in the police force. I wanted to write a review for this film when I first saw it in theatres, but until now, I wasn't sure what to write. It's well worth renting, possibly owning as well, although it's not for all tastes."
1,Shame on you Farrel !!!,"The film doesn't bring nothing new about what can happen in the police of any country. Movies are to be enternaiment, they can be violent, sad, happy, scare you ... but an actor and all the people involved that agree in perform a scene like that with the baby ... SHAME ON YOU Farrel !!!"
4,Cool movie,"I agree with the other review in that the story line is nothing out of the ordinary. Typical New York good cop, bad cop storyline. This is why I didn't give it four stars but I have to give a lot of credit to the actors especially Collin Farrell. He is brilliant in this movie. I have to say, he nailed his performance to the tee. So the story goes: A family of cops, the dad (Jon Voight (Francis Sr.), his two sons (Edward Norton (Ray),Noah Emmerich (Francis Jr.) and their brother in law (Collin Farrell (Jimmy). They were all after this drug dealer who killed four other cops. Ray was thrown in this wild goose chase only to find out that Jimmy was somehow involved. So Jimmy somehow framed Ray (can't spoil the movie too much), they were in this battle of Ray's words against Jimmy. The ending could've been better but overall, it is a pretty good movie. Worth watching on DVD."
2,ZzZzZzZz....,"I purchased this DVD before ever watching it (something I have vowed I will never do again), and I was right to doubt my choice. Since Edward Norton is my absolute favorite actor, I assumed this movie had to be good. Even if the storyline was just okay, his acting prowess can almost always make a mediocre movie much better. Sadly, such was not the case with Pride and Glory. I didn't feel bad for the guys who lost their brother. The movie just had no depth, no feeling. Plus I fell asleep watching it the first time. I decided to give it a second shot. I found myself so distracted by everything around me that I couldn't even pay attention to the screen! That's how boring it is! Save your money and check out his better flicks (all the solid classics plus The Painted Veil, The Illusionist, even Red Dragon was better than this garbage)."
2,Waste of good talent,A typical corrupt cop story. Despite Norton and Colin this was an easy bore with nothing original or exciting.
3,Gritty,"The actors are fine. The settings and situations mean. The characters life, real, tragic and heartbreaking. But the script cops out at the end, leaving the viewer disappointed. Norton is a marvel."
3,Sit back and relax,A lengthy movie - but worth a watch and maybe even a purchase if non-stop action isn't what you're looking for.
2,Picture quality only review,"You buy a movie on Blu-ray for the better picture and sound. Pride and Glory is one that I wish I had bought on DVD. The picture was very grainy almost to the point where it was distracting my attention from the film. Good movie, but money wasted on the Blu-ray tag."
3,Norton/Farrell Cop Drama Entertaining But Over The Top,"""Pride and Glory"" is certainly not mining new territory in its familiar story about New York cops who investigate the loss of their own, and find corrupt bretheren at the core of the problem. It's not the first to look at the tension between balancing family loyalty and duty to law and one's oath of office. But it has great performances by Edward Norton, Colin Farrell, and Jon Voight, subplots that engage even if they are familiar as well, and a nice tension and edge to it.But what ultimately prevents the movie from being everything it could be is the way the movie heads to its conclusion, which is a full scale riot by citizens who are tired of police corruption and brutality. Not that it's completely out of the realm of possibility. In fact, it's happened before, but the way it happens seems contrived and unnecessary.Still, no one needs to be ashamed of the film. It is more than competent. It's just upended by an overwrought conclusion."
3,"A great ""lost 80's"" gem! Should be released in NTSC!","Probably the best ""post breakfast club"" work by brat-packer Judd Nelson. You'll also spot a lot of other great 80's talent in this film. Great acting, perfect casting and excellent story telling - all based on real events.This is a very good film and should certainly be available on NTSC (region 1) DVD.If you're a fan of courtroom drama's, films based on real events, and like movies with an 80's feel... you'll enjoy this ""lost 80's"" gem.-JM"
3,Useful document,"This 64-page booklet is a 1975 reprint. The original seems to have been made by the Great Northern Railway at an unknown date. The first part is a 24-page summary of the Verendrye explorations with emphasis on North Dakota. The second part is the elder Verendrye's report of his journey to the Mandan village. The third part is his son's report of his journey to the Rocky Mountains. Both journals are entertaining, but there is no scholarly apparatus to connect them to modern geography or tribal names, which is a difficult problem."
1,I am appalled!,"The word ""rap"" being tied to this monstrosity is just laughable! There isn't one single rhyme on the entire DVD, I could have recorded my students pounding better beats on their desks, and there's a bad 80's song out there somewhere that wants its keyboard riffs back. I actually remember being taught by a ""rap"" technique in the 80's called ""wrap-ups"" that was 100 times more effective: it included worksheets and kinesthetic learning tools. This DVD does not include any strategy.I wanted a new tool to help out my struggling students- I don't mind corny- but I wouldn't even think about using this because it's not even catchy. They go through each number sequentially and this is the extent of the rap: 4 x 1 is 4. 4 x 2 is 8. 4 x 3 is 12. Say that outloud to a beat and call it teaching, but there's no way that this is going to stick in a childs head.Don't waste your money."
3,Sharpen your Multipliction Skills,"This DVD is not one to teach your child the multiplication facts but one to use to sharpen their multiplication skills. The music is fast, loud and upbeat. My classes both enjoyed and were challenged by this DVD. This is great ""sponge"" activity for teachers."
5,AMAZING,"My daughter age 8 was struggling in math and while this DVD did not make her a shining star over night, it certainly helps her confidence and it shows. I am in love with this concept and I am seeing results daily. Before this DVD my daughter did not remember her 3X's tables now not only does she know her 3x's tables but she also knows her 4, 5 & 6. T give you an idea how long it took her to learn her tables she received this DVD for Christmas (stocking stuffer), today is January 23 and she has more to learn but I am confident she will. I love this DVD. Great buy worth every penny!"
2,fun songs,"Multiplication Rap is more fun than just rote memorization. It gives the children another hook to hang their hat on as they are learning basic facts. The more methods in which material can be presented to a child the more likely they are to understand and remember it. I have searched far and wide for a multiplication cd/dvd/vhs to present the multiplication facts in a fun way. This comes pretty close to what I hope to find. My 7 year old daughter is mildly interested in it, I have to suggest that she watch it rather than her askinG to watch it. She will then sit through the whole thing without complaint. My 9 year old son is not at all interested. I think a child under 7 would be more entertained by it."
3,accompanying cd is defective,"Very informative and well documented book. However, accompanying CD is defective. Due to what seems to me a bad duplication process, a very loud, digital, helicopter-like noise, kicks in after 10 minutes into the program and only gets louder from then. Publisher refused to provide substitution for CD. I'll have to return book and CD to Amazon."
1,Disappointing,"Yo-Yo Ma is a wonderful cellist. Unfortunately, this DVD does not showcase his talent but is hijacked by self-indulgent ""filmmakers"" who think we are interested in Mark Morris' artistic angst as he struggles through choreograpic rehearsals complete with four-letter expletives. Yo-Yo is talked-over background music in much ""Falling Down Stairs,"" which reminded me of the bumper sticker: ""Humpty Dumpty was pushed."" I deposited the DVD in the trash before finishing ""Sarabande."""
3,"Not as good as ""The Lure of the Basilsk""","What I wrote for the first book of the series, ""This book had some interesting ideas, and I remembered enjoying it as a kid. 23 years later it wasn't as spellbinding. Still not bad, but the writing and plot is fairly simplistic. The original Conan series are an obvious influence and better."" The same applies for this book. It is fairly boilerplate fantasy and bogs down about a third of the way though. Seems like a short story squeezed into book length."
5,Dunloe Sham,"Beautiful Sham. Still need to find one more to complete set. The comforter, bed skirt, shams and pillows are fantastic."
2,What is this?,"I have to say that the person who thinks that this even remotely compares to Norma Jean ""Bless the Martyr..."" is probably insane. The music on ""Throwing Myself"" sounds like something Slipknot refused to put on one of their own albums because it was too yielding. The music has no heart and is easy to say this having heard Norma Jean and The Chariot. I still think the vocals are great and that's the only reason for two stars."
3,more than decent,"i just collected this album, partially to find out pre-Norma jean music, and to also keep notes of how the band started with all the original members, and though it was around where i expected, this is not in any way like Bless the martyr, and kiss the child.i realize this must have just been an awkward stage for them discovering what music they are capable of making, and i do not regret buying nor do i think it is bad, but i do not have the same passion for it (yet) that i do for bless the martyr, and kiss the child.and the lyrics were a bit repetitive through out the album, i felt like they could have expressed with a wider range of vocabulary.but overall this was interesting and i would suggest this to any REAL Norma jean fan, not just the people who listen to 1-3 songs off of Bless the martyr~, and definitely not the people who only like their new stuff.but anyone who claims to like everything they ever did, must have this album."
2,"This is terrible! ooh, wait, that wasn't tolerant...","I am tolerant! Proclaims the middle class white boy between an Asian girl and a black boy! I am tolerant, he later explains, while lighting a menorah.Couldn't there have been a few pages with other people tolerating the white middle class boy? How about a variety of people tolerating a variety? (OK, asians and blacks are out-numbered by whites at this time in the United States. But if you are going by sheer numbers, females outnumber males. So why is the white boy representative of ""normal?"")When you see all the letters after the names of the writers, you'd think all that education would have resulted in a better book. This is embarrassing."
1,Burma Shave,"Junk. Would not play on a dvd/cd player or new computer. Some of it barely played on old computer. Music out of sink with movie. I was not asking for much and not expecting much but just got ripped off. Amazon, let alone Tom should not be linked with such garbage. Maybe I'll use it as a coaster."
4,Vintage Tom,"This DVD is now available in NTSC Region 0 format. It looks like it's from a concert film from the 80's. A bit grainy, no real extras, but it's Tom doing what he does best, playing piano and guitar, smoking and winding through his stories with his gravel voice. Great stuff."
1,Love Waits But This Is A Ripoff For the Most Part,"Low quality, but good enough. Only thing is, during a song a totally different song by a totally different band started playing right in the middle of one of Tom's songs. It happened three times during the same TW song, each maybe being 5 seconds long. It was like the DVD was recorded over something else. IT REALLY SPOILS THIS DVD.This was a RIP OFF."
2,Not as helpful as other books,"This is not a terrible book, but it covers only very broad basics. Mackenzie's approach is fairly common sense, and while some people might benefit from the basics, I didn't find it particularly helpful."
3,Good Book About Classroom Management,This is a good book to read to gain knowledge of how to get a grip on managing discipline in the classroom. Its also a good college text to use for learning purposes.Each 1 Teach 1
5,This book is excellent!,"All I can say is, ""Where in the world was this book in my teacher education courses?"" This book gives effective, practical methods for managing the classroom. It finally helped me recognize what I was doing wrong in my approach to discipline. I put the suggestions to use in my classroom and saw real, positive changes. Sudents' behavior actually improved as we approached the end of the school-year rather than deteriorated. It's as if someone finally let me in on the secret of a well-managed classroom. I highly recommend this book. It should be required reading for all teachers."
5,They Just Get Better and Better,"This is definitely one of the most brutal New Wave albums of the new millenium. I have yet to see them live, but I will someday. Anyways, I thought this would be crap compared to Pass Out of Existence, because that is usually the case of all bands (good major label debut, then.....crap). However, that is not the case for Chimaira. There overall sound has changed, dropping the attempt at sounding like the mighty Slipknot, to something like Slayer-ish New Wave. Way heavier than Pass Out of Existence, and musically better as well. Best songs are Cleansation, The Impossibility of Reason, Pictures in the Gold Room, Power Trip, Pure Hatred and Eyes of a Criminal. For those of you who don't know, Eyes of the Criminal is the lead track for the new horror movie Saw, so check it out when it hits theaters. Buy this if you like your music brutal as hell."
2,eh? so what...,pictures in the gold room is the only song i really like on this cd. the instrumental at the end is ok too i guess... if this is what you are looking for then go for it... i was told it was this awesome new heavy band... well they aren't that awesome. i'd rather listen to soilwork or nevermore!
2,Really?,"The only songs I like on this CD are 'Down Again' and 'Pictures In The Gold Room.' As for the rest of it...I don't understand how anyone considers this to be music. I could not tell one song from another...I don't get it, and I'm fine that I don't get it. All Chimaira fans upset at my review, you made me more upset saying that I should spend money getting this CD. Thanks.This from a fan of In Flames, Dredg, Tool, and open minded to more than one genre of music."
5,Thrash Metal Masterpiece!,"Wow! Man, these guys are incredible metal musicians! I saw them last night on the 04 Jagermeister Music Tour with Death By Stereo, Fear Factory and Slipknot. They put on a blistering performance! I would encourage anyone who hasn't seen these guys live to do so.Now onto my review of this cd. Slayer and others are predicting Chimaira to be the next big ""Thrash Metal"" band. I would definitely agree. This album is just plain incredible. I would recommend any fan of heavy metal to buy this cd. Some of the noteworthy tracks are Cleansation, Power Trip, Down Again and Pure Hatred. Actually the whole cd just rocks. All of the tracks are strong.This is definitely one of my favorite metal bands that is new. I would also recommend you pick up their other cd ""Pass Out of Existence."""
4,ALL AMERICAN HEAVY METAL,"This cd is simply great,I love this band they kick ass.They'vebeen called the american In Flames,In Flames being a very gouldand heavy band aren't as good as Chimaira.Chimaira are great theyare so solid they remind me of an updated Slayer.And this cd show-s that they are in total control of thier instuments.Their firsteffort sucked,but I love this Clensation,Impossiblity of Reason,Down Again,Crawl,Power Trip are the stand outs a few of thesesongs have guitar solo's that would make Zakk Wylde play some airguitar.And the double bass licks are nothing short of amazin.Theman himself Kerry King said this band is the second coming of allthat is good,He was right check these guys out."
5,chimaira are the best so buy the album its the gratest ever,all i can say is wow this album is so powerful its like when something hits the spot well this dose hit the spot. its a brillient album its amazing if your going out to buy this album then buy it. its worth the money so dont download any of it cuz thats why musics gettin all no profited so get ur credit cards now and buy this cd its absoloutly amazing its a masterpice of an album me myself being in a band i would be really proud to bring out an album of this quallity its brilliant.i hope you didnt need me to tell you this and you already new that the seccond this cd come out that you had to get it because if you didnt it would just be wrong and i will upset the ballance of life for anyone not to buy this cd its just simply the greatest.i knew straight away that i had to get this album but im a hardcore CHIMAIRA fan so i loved the album but seriously its exelent for anyone so id buy buy buy if i were you. !!!!!!!!!!!
4,Well-Rounded,"I got into Chimaira not to long ago....and I am completely addicted. I've been listening to Slipknot, OLD Korn, Nothingface, and Manson for years and years......but all of those CD's have been cased for Chimaira. Some people say the vocals aren't that great....but I think they are indeed original. It's a great break away from the constant demon growl. When Chimaira's lead singer screams.....it sounds like what I would. I like music I can connect to in some way, shape, or form. The lyrics don't seem to be as deep as the first album, but songs like ""Pure Hatred"" will keep you wanting more.Chimaira is perfect for the metal fans who want to shy away from the classic metal sound which can get very redundant. This is where Chimaira breaks off.The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is cause it didn't strike me as an instant classic, such as Antichrist Superstar"
5,An album you never get bored of! Ass-ripp'n metal!,"What more can I say? I love this album, and everything about it! 'Cleansation', 'Pure Hatred', 'Power Trip', & 'Down Again' are my favourite tracks and provide some kick ass thrash metal riffs and insane drumming and vocals!No wonder metal icons Slayer love this band so much!"
4,Metal is Alive!,"That idiot that gave this CD 1 star, and then went on to diss the bandmembers' integrity, is a dillusional joke!You don't get up one morning and decide to make money in the music industry, especially not when you are a Metal band. These guys bust their asses touring, bringing it to the fans night after night. Are they as rich as 50Cent or Britney? Not even close. Will they ever be? Nope.Why?Cause they make the music they want, and if Kerry King says your lead guitarist is good, then by god, he didn't just go and teach himself lead guitar riffs overnight!Point is: This album delivers a hearty punch to the stomach, it captures you with it's raw edge, and it steers the metal wagon in a different direction than what shadows fall and killswitch are doing. That's great for metal as far as I'm concerned, as variety is after all, the spice of life.PS-The instrumental track on this CD is well worth it's weight in gold...EPIC!"
1,Interesting,"If you can't get enough Slipknot and don't mind the thought of listening to a clone, this CD is for you! It's not bad, but like Coke says, ""There's nothing like the real thing"". The music ain't bad, but, I give em one star for the lack of originality."
2,In the wake of KoRn wannabee's.... yawn...,"Well, yet another KoRn ripoff with Metalica guitar riffs. These guys get an extra star because they did at least attempt to disguise themselves with a lot of lyrics you can't understand. But again that to is nothing new.If you like this type of music then buy it by all means, but at least buy it from among the dozens of bands that do it better. And please stop indulging bands like this who just throw together material from other bands they like and try to sound good."
4,"""Constant Horrific Nightmares""","4.5 stars. I first picked up ""Pass Out of Existence"" but later, after seeing this album posted on so many Listmania lists here uderscored with due praise, I checked this out. Wow! Simply put, this CRUSHES!!! their first release. While the lead vocals are grating at times, there is enough variation in his rasping shouts and enough emotional power that I rarely got irritated. This album is inspiring when considering the direction of mainstream Heavy Metal these days. Nu-metal is crap! I have a serious question. Who the hell is that drummer? Holy....!!!! Andols Herrick's drumming is incredible, and pummeled me senseless the first time I heard this nearly excellent CD. While the lyrics are cliched, bordering on adolescent, the delivery given by Mark Hunter on vocals makes my negative crititcism almost irrelevant. The riffs here are inventive and induce heart-felt headbanging and thrashing of limbs. The production is also first-rate. I am very impressed."
4,It's About Time!,"For those unfamiliar with Chimaira, they sound like a mix between Pantera, Alice In Chains and (Pre- ""...And Justice For All) Metallica. Because of that, ""The Impossibility of Reason"" is quite a powerhouse of heavy music. The vocalist does the Anselmo thing, but on the track ""Down Again,"" the band helps out and allows him to pull off the Staley/Cantrell vocal harmonies to the point where it actually sounds like Layne (R.I.P) is singing. Creepy. The musical composition of each track is like how Metallica used to write (think Battery) but their sound is like the raw power of Pantera. Yes, they have guitar solos on here too- thank God bands are starting to do this again. I'm giving this CD 4 stars because this is one of those CDs that has standout tracks. Some songs sound like filler to me, but that's my opinion. Overall, this CD is great and gets better with each listen. Chimaira will be huge if they continue producing albums like this."
4,A nice evolution...,"Chimaira has developed greatly as a band since there great debut 'pass out of existence.' This new cd starts with a boot to the throat and just stomps until the end. The tracks are relentlessly heavy, and display a much greater control over their sound than their previous efforts. Their drummer in particular has really become a dominating force of the music with his relentless and heavy double bass rolls that start and stop on a dime with blazing speed. The guitars are heavy with many catchy riffs. The only thing that didn't change was the voals and that of course is a good thing. I definitely recommend this cd to show how bands should develop into powerhouses, not radio friendly sell outs. Check out stand out tracks 'power trip' and the excellent instrumental 'implements of destruction'."
3,I could do without some of the vocals,"I did not really think I was going to like this CD but I was pleasantly surprised. With the exception of some of the vocals that resemble those of an evil Sesame Street character, this CD rocks really hard. For starters, it is very heavy. Some idiot I know compared Chimaira's guitar sound to Stinkin Park (this is probably why I didn't think I was going to like this one). The two sounds could not be more different. There is no chance that Linkin Park will ever sound even remotely this heavy. While I don't see Chimaira in the top 5 of next generation metal bands, they are definitely worth a listen."
2,Boooo....,"I bought into the hype that came with this cds release, and I was sorely disappointed. I just can't get into the sound of this band. The sound is best described as uncomfortable; the vocals are weak, and the music really doesn't go anywhere. These guys are trying to be something they are not. This is precisely why American metal has been stuck in a rut since the passing of Chuck Shuldiner (rest in peace); there is nothing new about this. This sounds like everything else out there. They seem mad for the sake of being mad. Why does everybody have to be so mad? Or at least think they have to pretend to be mad? When the guys from Slayer are pissed, I genuinely believe it. I think these guys were in my high school's marching band..."
3,Good... but not great,"There is no doubt this CD rocks... but with the talent in this band it could have been allot better. In my opinion it sounds too much like Killswitch Engage or a watered down ""nu-metal"" version of Slayer. Basically there is nothing original about Chimaira's sound or lyrics. If you want to hear a good new (not ""nu"") metal release with an original approach checkout Superjoint Ritual, Hatebreed, Lamb of God, or especially Shadows Fall."
1,Wish I hadn't listened to the hype...,"Take away the awful singer and this wouldn't be a bad album. Unfortunately, the terrible singing and GOD AWFUL lyrics make it impossible for me to enjoy this. The vocals and lyrics are straight out of nu-metal. I can't listen to bands that say ""blah blah blah I hate everyone."" The clean singing is so terrible and gay sounding. I LOVE clean singing. Opeth, shadows fall, Amorphis, Katatonia, these bands have amazing clean vocals. Chimaira's suck. I wish they would ditch this terrible vocalist and become a good band."
2,"boring, overrated, whatever","I bought this album (last fall) thinking it would have the same affect on me as ATG's Slaughter of the Soul or something like that. Of course, that was based solely on people's reviews and enthusiasm for this album. I'm really not sure how such a mediocre record has gotten so much attention...everything here is safe and cliched. I feel betrayed. Even if you're not that much of a metalhead, the staleness and unoriginality should send you running. Not to mention the fact that the vocalist is absolutely horrible (the adjective ""whiney"" immediately comes to mind). Whatever."
2,jack the ripper 101,"Very surprising after reading the her well-organized thrillers - this book is sloppy and you get the feeling she became increasingly disillusioned with her theory as she wrote it. She obviously knows very little about Jack and understands nothing about the artistic soul. After all, a gloomy artist like Sickert would have been fascinated by the case. She doesn't mention that he lived in rooms years after the murders and was told by the landlord that it had been lived in by the Ripper - of course he would paint it! Also, as for the man leaning over the woman in the painting in Ennui - everyone knew the Ripper was supposed to have approached his victims from the back and slit their throats. The only thing she has proved is that the mischievous letter writing Sickert probably wrote a couple of the 600 hoax letters - big deal!!"
4,The Go Go Dance Who Stole My Viagra....,"Another fine offering from Dean Barrett. A number of duplications from his ""Noy of the Horny Toad, and Other Anomalies"". Fun read."
4,legacy,"The first disc, simply the regular Pearl album, is incredible and definitely worth buying. However, the second disc has its high moments but leaves something to be desired. Buy just regular Pearl, and for live Janis go get Live in Winterland 68, it is very powerful and you won't be disappointed."
5,The previously released tracks on disc 2 are...,"The folks at Columbia have been releasing the same Janis material across several different releases. So, for those who are wondering if they already own some of the Calgary show that makes up disc 2:Tracks 1, 6, 8, 11 appear on the single-CD remaster ofPearl.Tracks 1 and 8 also appear on disc 3 of theJanisbox set.Tracks 3, 8, 12, 13 appear on JanisIn Concert.I think Summertime is previously unreleased, and this second disc is worth it for that alone."
4,nice!,"i bought this purse a few monthes ago. i wanted a different metallic purse. it's nice! the material is soft, and it has enough room for all my stuff. and it zippers shut so nothing falls out! i'm now on a search for a new purse,always really!"
1,Please do not buy- Its an absolute waste of money,"This is the worst 35 dollars I have ever spent in my life. This so called nursing cover- covers absolutely NOTHING. I dont know what people are talking about when they say it covers them when they r feeding. I bought this cover after reading all reviews- I needed it because I was travelling and wanted a cover to cover me on my flight. It definitely did not cover me and am I glad that I took a window seat. Everyone advised me to take an aisle seat, so it would be easier to go and change my baby when needed instead of having people get up in order to get out. I luckily took a window seat- thankfully! I was literally completely exposed on one side, as I needed the other side where other people were sitting, covered completely.I would not recommend it- It is an absolute waste of money!"
4,Exactly as Expected,"They're sanding dics. Nothing special, nothing sexy. They performed to specification exactly as expected. Stick well to the surface of my power sander, and stay put as designed. Very pleased."
4,Couldn't put it down,"From the moment I started this book, it had me hooked to see what would happen next. It flowed fairly well and kept me on the edge of my seat. Although it reminded me of other stories or movies I've encountered, it was a good read. Junk food for the mind, but I know the author enjoys writing and he would agree with me. Keep up the good work, Tim! Sorry it took so long to get this written."
2,"Not ""killer"" at all",What is the deal with Ms. Farmer's disdain for the police? Madeline's animosity towards police officers gets old and begins to take away from the story.
4,This won't be Ms. Farmer's last book for me!,"This is the first novel I've read by Jerrilyn Farmer, but her first two are in my ToBeRead pile. Farmer's writing is witty, entertaining and well-wrought in the ways of humorous mysteries. The cast of secondary characters is manageable so that you don't need a score card to keep track of them and she gives the heroine Madeline Bean a generous share of male attentiveness as the plucky caterer cum sleuth picks her way through a debacle of a wedding to discover who killed the wedding planner and used her body as a dinosaurian accessory.If you're a fan of Diane Mott Davidson, Sophie Dunbar or any of the writers of humorous mystery, you will enjoy Killer Wedding.Note to Ms. Farmer: Please....less Arlo and *much* more Chuck Honnett"
1,OUCH!!!!! THESE ARE DANGEROUS!!,THEY MAKE A VERY DANGEROUS RAZOR... I CUT MYSELF BADLY DO NOT PURCHASE THEM PLEASE!!! THE COMPANY IS FRENCH AND THEY DO NOT RESPOND...
2,Disposable & Cheap: Just What I Expected?,"I used these for the first time today. I knew they were cheap and would not last more than one shave. But I also confirmed that I would need 2-3 of them PER SHAVE because they work so poorly. It is almost as if Bic never actually tested them prior to selling them... or maybe they are testing them on someone with very very thin hair, such as a woman. I do not recommend this product."
3,2nd time's the charm,Amazon delivered but the deliverer was a DUD...books got wet and I was upset. Amazon fixed it right away....despite the incovenience it created in my hectic schedule. I do not like UPS anymore---they are getting more and more careless
4,Super Reader,"This is the Knight and Knave of Swords, with a different name. The final adventures of Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser are to be found here, rebadged in a different edition. Fahrd begins by learning to get along without a left hand, a problem yet again caused by those annoying god types. Hanging around leisurely should be peaceful, shouldn't it? Not when they have two women around, and others that would like a little payback coming."
2,Not a magical ending alas,"What is wrong with this book, which pales against the superb vibrant, middle of the series titles Swords Against Death, Swords in a Mist, and The Swords of Lankhmar, all towering classics of fantasy? Firstly there is little sophistication,mystery or magic here, Leibers style has deteriorated sharply into dull, long winded self mockery in his advancing years. Secondly Rime isle is a sadly boring, mundane place quite unfitted for our two oh so worldy wise heroes to end their days. Thirdly those self-same heroes themselves have deteriorated into middle age tedium, most alarmingly, rather like their creator appears to have done. If you dont mind all that, then buy the book."
5,An awesome Book!,"Kevin Leman gives it to you straight! With Love, Truth and Reality Discipline. A must Read for those who want a better Family in these times."
5,Hilarious Comedy,"I recently read ""Sister Mary Ignatius Explains it All For You"". I thought that it was a hilarious modern comedy. It was one of the few plays for school that I have actually enjoyed. I think that Durang finds the perfect balance between modernism, comedy and absurdity. After reading works by other modern playwrites such as Ionesco, the more subtle nature of Durang's work was welcome. I recommend this play to anyone who has any knowledge of the Catholic church or even anyone who doesn't but wants a good laugh."
3,it was ok,i found this book to be a little over the audiences heads. they didn't understand the slight comedy and were quite bored.
3,Have you met the Sister yet?,"I had seen this play years ago when I was living in Austin, remembered it fondly, so I picked it up back in December while I was working on my own one-act play (which I have now finished and feel quite pleased with). Durang spears the Catholic faith without mercy, and this would be hard to watch if it also wasn't so funny. And while Catholics may have the most problem with some of this, other literal beliefs might be surprised to find themselves reflected in Sister Mary and her unwavering trust in herself. Since my play was a satire as well, I tried to take as much constructive evidence from this that I could use.The other play in this volume is okay. Clever enough, I think it would be more effective on stage. It could be that I could visualize Sister Mary having seen a production of it, while I came at An Actor's Nightmare cold."
2,Small houses for rich people,"I thought this book was supposed to help you construct a very useful and pretty small house on a budget. I was wrong. Instead, it is about not too big houses where you spend tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, on all kinds of architectural extravagances. Perhaps this book could have a subtitle: How to spend a million dollars on a 1,500 square foot house. If you are looking to build a house efficiently and cheaply, this is the wrong book."
4,smaller house for retirement,currently remodeling a smaller home to be used for retirement. the not so big house collection helps you to think about how you can live with a smaller home and how you can change the space to be multi-functional. i plan to incorporate some of the ideas presented in these books to this remodeled home. these books were recommended to me by my architect as a start to the way we would need to think about and use our home in retirement.
3,An Okay Book,"The houses in this book are not really that small. I am in the process of planning out a 1200 SF home, and that seems tiny compared to some of the houses in these books.I mainly got it just to get some space use ideas, and just see what other people are doing.It is not a great book and there is better info out there.The biggest takeaway I can give you is that these are not TINY houses at all. They are just not 5000sf ""Mc Mansions"""
4,"Not so big, quality v quantity","Although a few people panned this book we found them somewhat useful.Good picts to give us ideas for our future retirement house.Although she talks about a green/passive solar house, the pictures detail don't quite bring in what you'd expect to make it a great renewable energy home.we liked the books as guide on how to think of ways to work on a decent price and size to live in.2000=2500 sqft is the max we want. didn't think about staggering the ceiling height great idea.since we wanted an open floor plan we plan to use tips from here to design up our texas house."
2,Not So Big House Collection,This book has many nice pictures but we did not get many usable ideas for our house project. Many suggetions are just too expensive and too custom to be practical unless you have an unlimited budget.
5,Perfection Combination of Music and Movement,"No one could have thought that figure skating routines could go so well with a solo instrumental piece, especially when skaters prefer to skate nowadays to songs. The lost artistry is revived by Torvill and Dean in this video, and ice skating has never been so graceful."
2,"Great Music, Bad Film","I wasn't sure how many stars to give for ""Six Gestures."" The music played by Yo-Yo Ma is fabulous, however, I was dissapointed by the way the film was made. The whole film is cut up and put back into sort of an odd arrangement. There is Yo-Yo Ma playing in Times Square, which I thought was pretty cool, but then there is this guy who plays some sort of a ""modern"" Bach. Weird. And the skating - you could hardly see it - kinda blurry. I was hoping they would show how they choregraphed the skating or maybe more interaction between the musician and the skaters (like the third Suite). Overall, ""Six Gestures"" was a dissapointment."
1,"Six Gestures, One Star",This video is like a quirky high school drama project that accidentally got produced. It would be interesting to watch if your kid had done it.
3,It's educational but doesn't hold my kids attention very well.,It's educational but doesn't hold my kids attention very well. They watched it a couple of times but they rather see other educational videos we have [...]) . I think its approach is a bit below their level (My kids are 6 and 8 years old).
2,Too musky,I am a regular user of Obsession For Men so I tried this but it doesn't work for me. It's hard to pinpoint the exact smell but it's a musky/woodsy/insect repellent smell and it's not getting any compliments from the ladies. Oh well.
5,thank u,so so cool i love it thanks you alot i love shopping onlice because i get the best things ever
2,Not horrible but not a favorite,"I know some folks who like it a lot but on me it has a dill smell, after a couple minutes that smell dies off and it smell pretty good but the dill effect lingers in my mind. Might smell different on you though, give it a try at the store first to make sure."
5,Great,"Obsession Night by Calvin Klein for Men, Eau De Toilette Spray is a very good product at a very great price."
4,"Manly, but not TOO manly","It is a well balanced scent. It has very faint lighter, almost floral scents to help mellow out the stronger, more earthy ones. It is a masculine scent without being as choking and overpowering as something more musky like some other cologne lines out there."
3,What happened...,"I have always loved Obsession. I don't understand what happened with this scent. I decided to take a chance and I am displeased with the smell. In fact, I said well maybe I was going through something so let me just try and wear it again to see if I would change my mind. You guessed it, nope. I wish I could return it but I'm sure I'll find a younger cousin or my pre-teen Son that would alleve me of this horrid cologne!"
1,Leaked and cracked,"When I received this product, the box was damp and dented and broken. When I opened up the product i saw that the cologne was cracked and leaking everywhere. Once i taped up the bottle I really only got 1 ounce out of it. I was very dissapppointed in this product."
4,Great Film!,"This unique indie horror film combines elements of both torture films (like Saw) and zombie films to come up with one of the most disturbing and gruesome films I've ever reviewed. The film never holds back on scenes depicting psychological, physical, and sexual torment and leaves them burning in your head long after the film is over. The film is well shot and I really like the colors used in the film; they set the tone for the entire film much like the pale greens did for the Saw films. I will say that in between the scenes of torture, I found the film to be kinda slow and you could see wholes in the plot, but just the sheer uncomfortable feeling you get while watching this movie makes up for that. If your not a die hard horror fan, I have a feeling you might not be able to handle just how brutal this film gets. It truly is disturbing and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it...three times..."
3,Shelter,"Cool move. A different look into one of mini possible atrocities due to nuclear disaster! But damn, this was one of the worse possibility! !!"
3,Shelter DVD review,Too bad this movie didn't have a budget worth a damn. I thought the two main characters did a fair job of acting. I have seen much worse films with much larger budgets. I would like to see this film re-made with a bigger budget and more character development.
2,Disappointed a bit,Expected little and was still disappointed.....shoulda passed on this one....I hope this helps you to not make the mistake I did and waste your money renting this awful flick.
3,Some people dont know when to leave well enough alone,"5 stars for the actual recording effort on the bands part...1 star for the remaster disaster on Edsels partSome people dont know when to leave well enough alone......The bass is weaker than the original CD ...the mids are notched way down...and the highs are excessively overdriven...to the point of being harsh and aggressive..causing major listening fatigue.I find that many of these ""so-called"" remasters are victims of compression overdrive...seems to be techique these guys just have a need to over abuse...They did the same injustice to the JOURNEY catalogue....It's almost painful to the ears to sit and listen to the entire CD......We used to call it ""listeners fatigue"" back in my days of selling HiFi gear in the 70's.I have waited for several months for the release of these 3 double cd sets by Edsel.....I just gave them a listen.....but the booklets are definitely worth the price"
5,Great play,"I have never seen this play performed, but after reading the script I would love to. Setting and action are kept to a minimum, allowing the dialogue to express more clearly the relationships between the three characters. Mr. Blessing demonstrates a wonderful grasp of familial relationships."
3,A neat look at what was known about the solar system in the late 1970's...,This book remains a good basic primer about the science of astronomy. And it is a fun book to read in the sense that our knowledge of the Sun and the rest of the solar system was considerably more limited back in the 1970's when this book was published. And yet this book holds a special place in my heart since it was the first book about astronomy which I ever read at the age of 13.
4,good book,I liked this book about the life and tragic untimely death of the late great Valentino. I wish it was longer though. Best best book I have read about Rudy Valentino though is THE DARK LOVER and RUDOLPH VALENTINO: The early Years.
4,Cute,"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter because she loves the Bratz. It was smaller than expected and tips over easily if your child is not careful, butit is cute and it serves its purpose."
5,Great product,I used these in conjunction with a watts crimper and they worked great. They are very well built and scream of quality. Very happy using these types of crimps vs the bands. Just remember to get the crimping tool if you do not have one.
3,Fresh and talented,"Jeannie Ortega's debut album-No Place like Bklyn-is fresh and rythmic. It has a pop/R&B feel to the album. Jeannie has a great voice which adds softness to the songs.Overall i tink this album is good, though it could have been better."
1,This 'Jeannie' needs to go back into her bottle,"This album is wack! I listened to it on AOL Listening Party, and honestly she lacks what she is trying to bring. Jeannie Ortega's best song (the only good song on the CD) ""Crowded"", which so happens to be her first single. She came out with ""So Done"", which sounds like a JoJo ""Leave (Get Out)"" rip-off!!! Jeannie is really a tacky singer, her ""Green Iz"" song is lame, it makes me laugh. She is trying POP/RAGGAE (WHICH SHE SUCKS AT), AND A LITTLE BIT OF ALTERNATIVE/R&B. Her album only debuted at No. 127 on Billboards, which shows right there that she isnt good. I mean The Cheetah Girls are doing way better than she is, even Raven-Symone (who are label mates). But Jeannie Ortega is crappy, if you want to ride in your car with this stuff blazzin', make sure you have your windows rolled up TIGHT!!!!!"
1,Just Your Usual Everyday Flavorless Pop Music,"I listened to this album last week and I really couldn't get into it. It's straight up pop with just a little bit of R&B and Hip-Hop mixed into it. All of the tracks are totally forgetable and pretty much sounds like what every other pop artist is doing- nothing. Jeanie can carry a tune, but she doesn't have a strong voice or presence and she's better off being a background singer. Seriously, I wonder how Jeannie was able to get a record label to invest money in her because this CD is dull."
4,Charming film with Provence as the star,"I've noticed that male critics didn't like this film. Could it be because stud movie star Russell Crowe ""betrayed"" them by taking on a Hugh Grant-like role? This isn't a heavy-weight drama, it's true, but its charm and its true love for Provence shines through. The plot is standard: bad boy meets feisty girl and high jinx ensue. It doesn't have the complex hilarity and pathos of a Sideways, but this film's formulaic structure is secondary to the gorgeous cinematography, the music, and the quirky characters. A fun way to enjoy the ambience of beautiful Provence if you can't afford to get there soon."
4,A Good Film,"This is one of those films that grows better with time - just like a good wine.Firstly I wasn't sure about whether I liked it or not, but in the end I think of it as a sweet and cozy film that I enjoyed and would like to view more than once. It is a feel-good movie and I think that Russell Crowe and Marion Cotillard are doing an excellent performance."
4,"France, France, France","Ridley Scott? Russel Crowe? Again Hollywood has done it. Taken talent and managed to make a so-so movie. Ok, it is really cute. An English banker somehow inherits an estate in the South of France (!) where of course an excpetoinal wine happens to be produced secretly (Coin Perdu). Of course he meets a French woman and so on...I mean this is completely incredible in some ways that they dared to write such a screenplay. A bunch of bad clichés thrown together...Ok it is nice and we had a good time watching it but actually it is very slow-moving and there is really no story. Oh by the way the real star of the movie is the Palm Treo phone that gets displyaed quite often (it also does not work that well in reality)."
2,Not one of Russell Crowe's Best Works....Or the Director's for that Matter,"After reading some rave reviews, my husband and I settled down on the couch for our ""date night"". I am sorry to report that we were both sorely disappointed in the movie. We are both huge Russell Crowe fans but this may be his worst acting in a long time. I'm not sure that it is his fault so much as the script. I had a hard time believing that this ""heartless, ruthless"" male chauvinist (his character is ALWAYS staring at a woman's chest or derriere) is what became of the sweet, thoughtful boy that is wonderfully depicted by the young actor. In fact, the boy and Abbie Cornish, who plays his cousin, are the true stars of this movie. In my opinion, this movie does not hold a candle to true classics like ""Under the Tuscan Sun."""
2,Not A Beautiful Mind,"I accidentally clicked to rent this movie instead of one of Russell Crowe's other films I saw, years ago, ""A Beautiful Mind."" ""A Good Year"" was quite forgettable, I regret to say, as I had wanted to see ""A Beautiful Mind"" again, even after many years."
3,Relentless stock broker finds out what life if all about,"Russell Crowe plays an ambitious British stockbroker who gets his highs from making clever moves on the stock exchange, regardless of what effect his actions have on other people. He inherits his uncle's estate and winery in France and goes there in order to prepare it for sale. Instead his return brings back memories of happy times spent with his uncle and a reacqauintance with a kinder, gentler way of life. The scenery is breathtaking, the acting is good and the premise is interesting, but some parts of the movie were hard to understand. There is a question about the quality of the wine produced in Crowe's inherited estate, and whether it was the screenplay, the actors' accents or a confusing script, we were not always sure as to where the plot was turning and what was happening. The best things about the movie were Russell Crowe and the beautiful scenery."
4,Good for what it is,"3 1/2 StarsI think the reason A Good Year has gotten such mediocre reviews is that people are expecting Russell Crowe to shoot off fireworks, no matter the picture. There isn't some deep message, or psychological drama here. If you watch it with an open mind, and don't go in expecting it to be great, then it is an enjoyable movie. Crowe looks like he is having a great time here, not having to worry about Oscar chances. He comes off as an arrogant businessman, and that's what his character is. This is a fun movie, nothing more, and nothing less."
4,Beautiful setting and a witty charm,This is a movie that my wife & I have watched many times. The setting is just magnificent and the overall mood of the movie is charming with a few darker look back on the main characters life. Russell Crowe does a really good job of keeping the movie going. The story is a bit weak but his acting and the setting keep the movie more than watchable. Grab a bottle or three of red wine and enjoy.
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I read Peter Mayles book A Good Year and had high hopes that the movie would be just as good as the book, but unfortunately it wasn't. I would go on to say why, but I'm trying to recoup the time I spent watching this movie!"
3,A Good Year,"This is not a bad film its okay, russel crowe does a pretty good job in this film. it's lighthearted humor and kinda sad. but all in all it ok"
3,"Nothing special, but an okay movie","After reading the reviews for this movie on Amazon, I was somewhat disappointed when I finally got to watch it. The movie is mediocre, and moves along slowly. A lot of issues are never addressed that come up in the movie, and most of it is forgotten when Russell Crowe's character gets the girl.All in all this movie is better to rent or borrow from the libary than purchase unless you're a die-hard fan of one of the actors. There are some pretty views of the French countryside, but having been to France, there are more picturesque towns without hugh chateaus."
3,Tour of Provence without a razor.,"This is a so-so film. Russell Crowe plays himself -- arrogant, obnoxious, and unshaven. One would think that with his income he could afford a razor and at least an occasional bath. Albert Finney and Freddie Highmore were worth watching but Crowe hogs the film -- not unexpected given his monumental ego. A little less Crowe and a lot more of the other actors would have greatly enhanced this film. It has its share of product placements and a LOT of French and Frenchmen. Overall the film was OK, the photography well done, the screenplay so-so, the personal hygiene below standard, but it was France after all. Rent but don't buy."
4,"Good movie,","First I watched this movie I didn't pay too much attention to it but when I saw those bueatiful scenery I bought the movie for myself.Second time I watched ""A Good Year"" - I enjoyed it. It is romantic , easy to watch. I like it."
2,A bad year for films,Russel is a dramatic actor and might want to stick to that. Ridley's film was a mixed bag of cliches and loose storyline.
3,"good ""feel good"" movie, if a bit predictable...","A feel good movie to take you to Provence for a couple of hours. Crowe is not at his best, whereas Marion Cotillard is the real star.The moral of the story is one I share: work to live, don't live to work. The setting (ruthless London city trader sees the light and a pretty woman and turns good) is a bit trite. But then again the point the movie is trying to make is a simple one. But a strong one.But this is also a movie about wine. You learn a bit about French wine making specifically, though American wines enter the fray when Max's cousin comes into the picture. A couple of references are made to the France-California rivalry: I would recommend watching the film ""Bottle Shock"" together with this one. This movie was made the same year as the rematch of the famous blind tasting challenge known as the Judgement of Paris, again won by California over France.The ending is predictable, sort of, but with a fun twist..."
5,A Good Year,The acting and locations are great. If your looking for Russell to kill a few dozen people do not see this. If your looking for a feel good love story A Good Year is great!
2,But Albert Finney and supporting give great performances.,"Crowe, and others, do an excellent job in this mishmash of odd storytelling, direction and wrong music. And the lengths gone to for set decoration and atmosphere were absurd, and needlessly costly. Let's see the guy do this film without so much cash.The idea that Max would want to ""shag"" his new-found cousin is deplorable for obvious reasons, but also because that role is played rightfully young, with far more important things on her mind, and it makes Max disgusting. This has got to be one of the most unbalanced films ever made, and it is very much an insult to the French people - although the documentary dialogue assures us it is all in good fun. Meanspirited is what it is. Irrational."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I don't like to write negative reviews but this movie was really boring. I had hoped at least that the scenery would make up for a predictable story, but even that didn't make up for the bland, disjointed plot. The main actors here happen both to be Oscar winners, so they try to do what they can, but to no avail. It just didn't hold my attention at all, and I have a long attention span. If you're looking for a relaxing, feel-good movie with a theme of travel or self-discovery, I'd go with something like Under the 'Tuscan Sun', 'The Holiday', or the lovely 'Midnight in Paris'."
3,Redemption for rich [...].,"Forget sack cloth and ashes, crises of conscience, suffering, The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come or giving all your worldly goods to the poor. These days, all any rich, cold hearted bastard needs do to reclaim his humanity is inherit a French chateau with a vinyard.That is, evidently, the premise of this slight, very slight slice of French custard, well...not really French. It dabbles in Frenchness here and there, the way the English percieve it...sort of.If you can wipe your mind clear of any kind of critical thought while watching this trifle, it is just barely entertaining enough for a pleasantly numbing experience particularly if you drinking a couple of glasses of wine as well."
4,A Good Year,Another Ridley Scott triamph. An excellent story told well and filmed magnificiently. Have just visiy=ted the south of France and this movie drought it all back. A good people story. Wonderful
1,Predictable feel-good romantic comedy.,"I agree with the negative reviews. Wait until it comes on TV, if you must see it. Save your money."
4,"Beautifully Filmed, A Gentle Romantic Comedy","Listen, no one is going to mistake this light, delicately filmed romantic comedy for Gladiator, but you have to analyze this film within the parameters of the genre. For what it is, it is a charming, low-key slice of life movie that makes brilliant use of its glorious settings as well as its stars.One bonus for tennis fans -- several pivotal and life-changing scenes are played out on the old red-clay court on the grounds of the estate. The scenes, like the film, are beautifully filmed and deftly played."
3,A lot different than the Book,The movie on its own was a delightful movie. It had some funny humor and a decent story line. It was lighthearted and easy to watch. With that being said it was not true to the storyline of the book. If you have the opportunity I would highly recommend the book as well as another book by Peter Mayle called Vintage Caper.
3,Romancing the Romantic,"Russell, Brad, Eric, Clive - Listen up. The guys in country music understand that women do the buying and women like a good romance. As it goes this one is pretty good. More depth in the characters is needed. Those lovely lines he utters to her when he comes back - yep we need more of that. But that is not the reason I write this review. Check out the music videos. Russell is my hero, both forceful and playful in the Weight of a Man. Well done. I watched it 9 times in a row. Do it again. Better yet, expand this into a great romance story. Be inspired - and tell me how I can get a CD of these songs! Thanks!"
2,Movie not up to the book,"I read the book flying to the West Coast from Florida, and saw the movie a week later on the way back on the plane. All I can say is, how could anyone who read this book make this movie? The only thing that stayed the same was Provence. They emasculated the mystery plot, made Russell Crowe a supersucessful trader instead of a broke ex-trader who needed to borrow money from Charley to get to France, etc. Contrived plot changes for dramatic effect are just stupid--running Fanny off the road, falling into the swimming pool, and the little car are three things that the book didn't need. Ridley Scott should be ashamed of this one. Two stars for the Provence scenery."
1,A Bad Vintage,"When you think of a romantic comedy set in Provence, the names Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott do not come to mind - hence this leaden 2006 adaptation of Peter Mayle's novel. Despite a colorful supporting cast and Philippe Le Sourd's location photography, director Scott and a charmless Crowe (who could play Hamlet but not Hugh Grant) mishandle the cinematic soufflé. ""A Good Year"" collapses during its first reel and never recovers."
2,Badly refermented movie,"Plodding movie, rehashed storyline, contrived writing, uninspired directing-take your pick. If you must judge for yourself, rent before buying."
2,"The Stage Was Set: Crowe, Scott, and..........Ugh!","I came into this movie with such high expectations, how could one not? I mean you have an A-list actor and director in Crowe and Scott respectively, and this ""intoxicating"" vineyard in France as the backdrop of the story, with ROMANCE being the main theme. At no point was I emotionally connected to any of the characters. The French Chic was hardly in the movie, about 1:30 mins in she becomes a ""major player"". I kept looking at my DVD running time wondering when this alleged ROMANCE was going to develop! That being said you have the typical filler characters (the daughter, the vitners assistant) blah blah blah. They spent too much time with Crowe going back and forth about selling the place, without ever developing the emotional/romantic connection that he was ""awoken"" too. For all the men, I urge you to pass this up when you and the lady are browsing the new releases, just tell them some guy on [...] told you ""it sucked""."
2,Aussie Walt,"I give this film two stars for photography. Russell Crowe is a fine actor but totally miscast in a comedy. The film is weak and anyone praising it will settle for almost anything.I think that the two Rs..Russell and Ridley, know that this is a dud and anything made afterwards will have to be much better. I am looking forward to American Gangster and the re-made 3:10 to Yuma because I think Russell will more than make up for this error in judgement."
3,Broken DVD,"What we saw of the DVD looked good, but the two DVDs in the store broke up and finally ""stalled"". We ordered our own ""A Good Year"" and are hoping this one will have no ""jerking, studdering, and crashing""."
2,For Your Age Only,"A younger person may enjoy this mish-mash of rapid scene changes, pointless, and many, flashbacks,an overlong tennis match, and a thin predictable plot line.Beautiful French scenery was quickly bypassed by a cameraman gone wild.Without the everpresent cell-phone (hello Paris- London calling) there would have been no sense to the story at all.We never did get to enjoy the wine----"
3,"a luke-warm so-so movie with blend, cliched script, directing, and so-so acting","lot of scenes should be deleted from this drag-along deadbeat movie, just like that 'under the tuscan sun'. quite quite boring. crowe's face has become even meaty and always given a little bit on the dirty and ugly side. did we have to watch the whole tennis play scene until the game was set? beautiful french countryside scenary. two beautiful young females as eye candy but totally out of place in this, say, romantic movie in the wine country? the dialogue was too staged and pretentious too. watchable, just like 'the holiday'. not too bad but absolutely not good enough to call it great. are we have enough of this kind of movies yet?"
1,Boring!,"We watched this because the summary sounded interesting and we generally like Russell Crowe, but we only continued watching it because we paid for it. I figured a movie set in Provence would be interesting at least for the scenery. There weren't even very many shots of that. The premise for a good movie was there, and the actors were accomplished, but whoever wrote their lines did a lousy job, it was just boring, and never really went anywhere. And I found the crudeness to be very unnecessary. Would never recommend it for any reason."
1,was this from the book of the same title?,The book was wonderful. The movie is just awful. I wonder if the screenwriter actually read the book. A real shame.
2,Pasted together,"It didn't really seem to know the best way to get where it wanted to go. I didn't get attached to the characters enough to care what happened to them, even though it was very obvious what was going to happen. Plot was on a straight, dead-end, predictable road."
2,so so,"This movie wasn't terrible but I won't watch it again. I heard it's like a male spin-off of ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" & I agree. Was hard to understand some of the script with the strong accents & I felt it kind of dragged on. Not Russell Crowe's greatest for sure."
3,Odd movie for Crowe and Scott,"I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I thought I would. I never do connect with Skinner and I felt the romance was just a convenient subplot. I wasn't sure if the cousin or the waitress was supposed to be the love interest for a while there. But overall, I felt this film was a male version of Under the Tuscan Sun. (France instead of Italy.) I didn't believe Skinner's transformation. Nothing in this captured my heart the way it should have. There was a few storylines just dropped. I thought the best friend and the cousin would become an item. But I did enjoy the soundtrack."
3,A Good Year,I bought this DVD because it was recommended as having beautiful scenery of Provence and it did have excellent scenenery and very pretty. However the overall film experience was not quite good enough to rate above average.
5,A very good year,"One of my all time favorite couple movies--a little something for everyone:action, competition, romance, love, decisions, humor, and superb acting."
5,Good Movie for wine lovers,"We enjoyed this movie for it is a lot like ""Bottle Shock"" but more human. The cast was great and it is almost like what life is like for the people who works at the wineries."
3,"A type of heist movie that has parts of ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" mixed with the Oceans movies. Not much new, but its OK. I say B-","""How does a guy like me wind up in a place like this?"" When Vince is released from prison he thinks he is free. After a run in with crime boss Kranski (Sutherland) he is forced to do one last heist before being allowed to move on with his life. Caught between being an artist and a thief Vince has to decide what life he prefers. This was actually a pretty decent movie, but it did tend to drag in parts and the love story aspect of it seemed unnecessary for the most part. There is not much new in this movie that has not been in hundreds of other movies, the big heist is pretty much a direct rip off of ""Gone in 60 seconds"". It's not bad but after that movie or ""Italian Job"" or the Oceans movies this one is a re-hash but not as good. Overall not a bad movie, but nothing you haven't seen before. I give it a B-.Would I watch again? - I don't think I will"
4,Lasted 3 Years,"I bought this unit in June 2008, and it just died about a week ago... nearly 3 years of continuous use. Not bad!I called Tripp Lite support to see if there was anything they could do. The unit was out of warranty, and they suspect that battery had just given up. They couldn't help, but I didn't expect them to. The guy on the phone was very nice and tried to be helpful. I waited <1 minute on hold to reach support.One side note: I have an older model of the HT1000 which does not have a user-serviceable battery. Newer models do."
3,Typographical Errors Make Reading Difficult,"While the content of Old New Land (Altneuland) gives a fascinating look into Hertzl's ideals for the development of a Jewish homeland, the Filiquarian edition makes reading continuity very difficult due to the tremendous amount of typographical errors. Often the typo does not interfere with the content of the text - modem for modern, or random periods throughout - but there are cases where the characters' statements are incomprehensible due to the error. Filiquarian Publishing, LLC offers no contact information on their website or within the book."
4,Business Leadership,I think this book yet small but very objective and opens the right tunnel to deal with others in very basic and understandable way especially with our teens. The way it suggests is a new one to deal with kids that give the confidence to both parents and teens the right to take the responsibility and accept the consequences. .
5,"Amazing system, amazing woman","I too have met the author--this was several months before the book was published. I am honored to have had the opportunity to get to know Jennie and her remarkable family. She does indeed live what she preaches.The best thing about the exchange system is that it can be applied to all relationships--as the book states, ""All relationships are exchanges."" It has made me aware of the compromises I make with other people every day. This is a valuable teaching tool that empowers us to change our relationships with others."
2,Songs of Distant Earth,"Arthur C. Clarke's Songs of Distant Earth was, unfortunatly, a bit disappointing. The ideas, on which the story is based, e.g. the sun going nova prematurly, are geniunly worrying and interestingly handled. Unfortunatly, the story itself left little to be exited about, as one chapter seems to drag into the next. By the time I was half way into the book, I found it about as exiting as watching foot fungus evolve sentience. I have to give two stars for the brilliant ideas and the realistic depiction of space travel, but the story and characters let it down. If your a Sci-fi buff, defidently give it a try, you might like it."
5,One of Clarke's absolute best,"I can only strongly echo the high praise offered by the other reviewers. I have read the book many times, and it never fails to stimulate the sense of awe and wonder which all great works of science fiction evoke. A superior work by one of the masters of the genre. Highest recommendation."
2,Clarke tries to move away from his most successful novels.,"The Songs of Distant earth is a journeyman's novel that could have been written by any number of writers. It is not terribly original, action packed, or thought provoking.It was published based on Clarke's success with the Odyssey series. My bet is that it was a short story from his pulp days that he was able to expand to novel length."
4,"Interesting Ideas, but no Rama","I have read a number of Clarke books the last 5 years or so and have become totally captivated with his writting.Although I believe that the 2001 and Rama Series' are his best works yet, this book definetly does not take second place.Showing a great deal about human nature I believe that it shows some ideas about people more than 1984 or A Brave New World ever did because it brings more aspects into account and is more realistic with our world.If you enjoy staying up till 3am reading and thinking, this is definetly the book for you!"
3,A lot better then Star Trek,"I like this book because Arthur C. Clarke at last address the more ""real' problems involved in traveling from one solar system to another. In Arthur's more science version of the universe, it will take about 8 or 900 years to travel from one star to the next, there's no warp factor six here to get you there in a week. The Songs of Distant Earth is much better reading then ten Star Trek novels combined."
5,My favourite sci-fi book!,"My sci-fi book number one. I really recommend its reading, especially together with the music composed by Mike Oldfield for the book (cd with the same title). It is also recommendable for people who are not so much into sci-fi because of its beauty."
3,Sir Clarke has definitely done better.,"After reading 2001, 2010, 2061, the Rama series, and Fountains of Paradise, I was expecting a lot more from this book. Not that it wasn't good; I enjoyed reading it. Unfortunately, it wasn't up to Sir Clarke's usual fare...character development was a little weak, there didn't seem to be an ultimate goal to the story (and this is reflected in the fact that there isn't really any climax), and he seemed to let the ending kind of dribble out. Overall, I would recommend that people pick up the books I've mentioned above rather than this one...they are much better."
4,Very Interesting Concept,"I first purchased this in May 1987. There are a few occasions where the players are a little predictable, but I liked it so much that, after loosing track of it through several Europe- North America transitions- I purchased another copy so that I could re-read it. Does anyone know of a sequel??"
5,One of the best Science Fiction novels period.,"A intruiging tale of a future which sees the end of Earth and our solar system and the visit of one colonized world in the far (yet so close in perspective to our galaxy even) reaches of space. This colony of Thalassa is at first a paradise with many interesting people and places to go as the last earthlings meet them. But by the end of the story a new world with Jealousy has poked through the seemingly perfect land, but all through A.C. Clarke gives what any book should undoubtedly have, a great mix of characters. This one is a definite must for any avid Science Fiction reader, and is my personal favorite Sci-Fi novel"
3,Colonists versus refugees- a clash of cultures,"This is a classic science fiction story. I found the characterization a little dry but the story of a colony and a vast refugee ship coming in for repairs was intriguing. Each were escaping the destruction of Earth, with the new group having better technology and are recently departed, while the colonists have an established life far separated from Earth. When the ship's personnel become split on whether to go forward or remain, the two divergent society's begin to clash."
1,"Interesting premise, poorly developed characters","The basic premise of the book is tantalizing enough - Man seeks to colonize distant stars as Earth is consumed by the sun. Unfortunately, the book is poorly executed. Characters are hastily constructed with little or no depth. Love triangles have a sterile feel that lets you shrug your shoulders and care for no party in particular. While the ambiance of the novel is attractive enough - interstellar travel, a space elevator cameo, a new planet to explore - the actual action occurring within the setting is of very little interest or substance. Clarke does manage to cobble together snippets of philosophical thought - 90% of humans in this future world are bisexual, God has (to the relief of mankind) finally been dispensed with, etc.My lasting impression is that the novel, quite simply, is utterly without a ""good story""."
2,Confusing,The book was to confusing because there were too many chapters and they were some of them weer too short. The book talk about one topic then a different topic and so on. I didn't get the book becasue I was so confused of what they were talking about. I think this book was poor because it had nosense in the book and there were characters that were confusing when they speak. So this is my review about this book.
1,Skim-Worthy,"As in the equal of the film on top of milk.There's a great premise here, of the destruction of Earth, and the meeting of remnant colonies from different eras. Not original, but a great premise nonetheless. However, the greatness of the premise only magnifies the tragedy of the novel development. Or rather, the lack thereof. For there is no real development here. It was incredibly disappointing. All of the answers you hope for are not included- in fact there are an increasing number of questions raised in the book. It is like the TV show Lost, if there was never a second season. It is as if Clarke came up with the first half of the book and forgot to finish it.This book is filled with long, drawn out romances that are neither interesting nor relevant. It is incredibly anti-Theist, seeking to attack any idea or person who is stupid enough to believe in a god. All this is ignorable if only it had a semblance of a plot; if events progressed, and the storyline completed. It doesn't."
2,Surprisingly outdated,"The engineering prophecies were not so much outdated--they were the most interesting part of the novel. It was the blatant anti-religion message that Clarke harped on rather obsessively, as well as the Harlequin-styled romantic passages that could have taken place anywhere, not just on another planet, but more likely in a preachy romance novel. I remembered Clarke as better than this."
4,Interesting look at a Draftee division,"While most US division where pre-war regular Army, or National Guard formations the 88th was formed from manpower pool the draft produced. The author has a personal connection to the division (his father commanded it), and tells its story with a great level of detail. While the story is not as colorful as some of the Guard formations (books on the 29th, 45th and 30th have more of a regional flavor) it still covered some new ground about these unique formations. If the reader is familiar with the Army's WWII manpower and unit/personnel formation policies, some parts of the begining of the book can be skipped."
2,One of the worst MST3K episodes...,"Forgive me for saying so, all you MSTies out there like myself, but isn't this movie just a little TOO bad? I mean, even if Joel and the Bots were in their best-ever form (which they absolutely aren't in this episode), would it really be worth it to sit through this cinematic atrocity? Well, maybe if they were as funny as in Pod People, one of their best, but still when a movie is just too bad, it seems like the writers have too much to work with and just work on the obvious (e.g. bad music, long senseless scenes, corny dialouge, no plot whatsoever). But as in Pod People, where its bad, but its production values are just good enough to have the MST3K writers sweat a bit, the episode seems to be much better than usual.I would provide some of the best lines from this episode, but there really aren't any. By the by, stay away from CATALINA CAPER also, for similar reasons."
5,"Great show, good price","Any review of Mystery Science Theater 3000 written by me is boilerplate. MST3K was one of the funniest and most intelligent TV series ever to inhabit the ether. I am proud to possess a copy of every episode (except the missing K0-K3 titles, and you Misties know of what I speak)."
4,pool basketball set.,"We love to play this game in the pool, because the set is sturdy and stable which is a plusto play baskets. thanks"
5,MUST READ BOOK,"This book is a must read connecting ancient civilization and astronomy. The author has obviously done extensive research. It is well written, concise, and extremely thought provoking with touches of humor. I have recommended this book to all of my friends.Secrets of the sphinx"
3,"A jumbled intro to ""Tymora's Luck""","I was rather disappointed with this novel as compared to previous Novak/Grubb books and to the FR books as a whole. But the introduction to the other planes of existence help further define the Realms and are just plain fun to read about. I was excited to see the long awaited appearence of Jas, from the old FR comic book series.Having read the Finders Stone Trilogy several times before reading this novel, I was still a little lost when it came to explaining Bane and the ending was a very big letdown - after all the hell Finder went through with Moandar in the FS trilogy, I expected more from Bane.Having the sequel, ""Tymora's Luck"" to follow helps alieve the pain of the ending if you also don't like it. This book is a MUST READ just to make it to the next book, which I found superior."
5,Wonderful,this is a great DVD! It is great for playing while dozing off to sleep. I have not slept this well in a long time.
4,children should watch this,"amazing. feels like you are there! the soothing ocean sounds..which are live and correspond with the actual wave making that sound...are so very relaxing and breath-taking. many different scenes with changing colors and locations. this would be a great way to calm children down and definately relaxing for all ages. i will surely buy more Waves brand products! very pleased. would be great for the ill, depressed, anxious. great in hospitals and waiting rooms.love that it loops. the only drawback i noticed is that the disc itself is somewhat thin. hoping this is not a problem for longevity of the product."
3,almost there,"I bought the DVd to watch on my laptop, and it is nice, but as soon as you start to forget your watching a dvd, you get reminded with a break that says ""what day it is??? why?? so odd.. Why the breaks? thats not in nature. I do think the quality is good if you are just watching on a small screen. Not sure about a big one. It does not seem high quality. For my purposes, it is ok, just get rid of the annoying breaks next time."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I am very disappointed with this DVD. I bought it purely based on the high reviews that it was given. This was a big mistake. The picture quality is terrible. The picture is very grainy and not at all sharp. I have a very nice HD widescreen tv, so I was hoping for clear and sharp images. This is not at all what I got. Also, there are no options to choose from like other DVDs offer. The only thing I liked about this DVD was the sound of the waves. I watched it once, and I doubt I will ever view it again."
2,Shoddy DVD Extras,"Too bad The Weinstein Company was so remiss in its production of the DVD Special Features. Why would it allow the producers to use the same warmed over interview bites in each piece? Somebody's asleep at the wheel, or they wouldn't have robbed their audience of fresh, new moments with Oscar winner Streep. Speaking of which, why not license a clip of Meryl's Oscar speech, red carpet and/or after party? Major fail over at TWC."
4,Good movie - unexpected focus,"I assumed this would be the story of the political career of England's first woman prime minister. It did tell that story indirectly through flashbacks, but the main focus is Margaret Thatcher in old age, suffering from senile dementia. That is also a powerful and moving story. Meryl Streep's performance is amazing."
2,"Awful Screenplay, Brilliant Performance","A failed attempt to combine a misguided ghost allegory with the powerful story of one of the most important women in the long and fabled history of Great Britain. Were it not for the brilliant performance of Meryl Streep, the film would not be worth watching. As it is, it is not worth watching unless you want to study Streep's inspired acting job in this otherwise epic disappointment."
3,Decent Study,A decent study of Thatcher. Meryl Streep does a great acting job. Too bad Holywood always has to through in the typical liberal bias to everything they do.
2,"Meryl Amazing, Movie Not So Much","The only reason to watch this movie is because Meryl Streep puts on another amazing performance. Brilliant as always, if you are a fan of her as an actress you will enjoy seeing her fully become the character. The reason I rate the movie lowly though, as I am a big fan of Margaret Thatcher and I thought this movie sold her short. Thatcher became powerful when politics was still really an old boys club and policies helped to steer England on a successful course. Unfortunately, the director probably isn't an conservative and therefore steers away from any positive portrayal of her ideas. Therefore, Thatcher comes across as kind of weak as you don't really see all that she accomplished. Without the policies playing more of a central role, the movie just felt flat."
1,Hugely Disappointed,"Dreadful film making. I can imagine the outcry if the story of Reagan was told in a similar way. I was really looking forward to learning the story of Maggie, but hated the time given to 'current' story / dementia (not sure if it is even accurate) and the focus on aspects of her later life that are so unimportant. I rarely tune out during a movie, and didn't expect to on this one, but I did. It's a real shame as the actresses were great. It totally deserves the number of one star reviews it is getting. What an opportunity missed. Hopefully someone one day will tell Maggie's story properly. I was never a fan of the lady, but wanted to see the story of a strong British PM done right. Not sure who was responsible for this indulgent pap, but they don't deserve another movie to make."
2,slooooow and way too much declining mental faculties,"Meryl Steep was, of course, amazing in her role.The problem is the script.Why on earth spend so much time focusing on Thatcher in decline (alzheimers? dementia?).So much more time could've been spent on the years in parliament prior to Prime Minister, and even more time on the PM years (not just the Falklands war).I forced myself to watch it through to the end, but it was not enjoyable."
2,Churchill in his slippers!!,"Imagine a movie made about Winston Churchill that concentrated for 2 hours on his habit of writing, smoking and drinking in bed, inter-cut with moments of his days in the political wilderness before WWII and never told you any of the rest of his amazing life! That's what this movie does to Margo Thatcher. I read a review that said it was a ""lefty's wet dream"" but I don't understand how NOT telling her story serves anyone's purpose? And that's what this story is guilty of. I gave it 2 stars only because Streep was great as an actress. You can't blame the woman that the movie went nowhere. Left or Right, if you've an interest in the moments of this woman's life that made a difference to the world, then skip this one."
3,Iron Lady,"A good film, but nothing special. Many of the critical issues she dealt with are not fully explored, thereby missing the importance of them."
1,Totally disgusted,We anticipated seeing this movie and hoped to see some of the great things this powerful and couragous woman had done for the sake of freedom and liberty. Instead the movie totally distroyed her and her legacy. This is an unfair portrail of one of the world's great individuals - we deserve more.
1,Terrible,Awful...just awful...boring...stupid editing...largely unflattering conjecture of a legendary leader masked as heartfelt...a waste a splendid actors...wait for human history to settle on a legacy before making one up.
1,A Slap In The Face,"All those responsible for allowing Mrs. Thatcher to be portrayed in this manner should be ashamed of themselves. This movie is a perfect example of how Historical License is greatly abused in the movie industry. Know the factual history first before twisting it around!Mrs. Thatcher has been suffering from dementia for over 5 years, and yes, she is slowly slipping away. However, during her entire time in office she was a force to be reckoned with. Be it war with Argentina or going after the IRA in Northern Ireland, she stood by her convictions and never wavered.Using her present illness as a means of scattered reflection upon her earlier years filled me with disgust. Total disgust!"
1,"great acting, crappy movie","The title says it all. The acting was top notch, but the storyline was confusing and poorly written. If you admire Mrs. Thatcher, don't watch this movie. And most notably, DON'T BUY IT!"
2,Disappointing,"This movie focused too much on the end of Ms. Thatcher's life instead of telling the story of the remarkable things that she did while she served as Prime Minister. Once again the Hollywood leftist elite told the story the way they wanted it to be remembered. I was expecting the story of an exceptional woman who accomplished amazing things during a tumultuous time. Instead, the story focused on what Ms. Thatcher MAY be like now-- elderly, delusional, and confused. I kept waiting for the movie to go into the main story, and it never did. I'm so glad we didn't buy this movie on DVD as it would have been a tremendous waste of money and storage space.In the long term, people will remember Margaret Thatcher as the great person that she was, long after they will have forgotten everything about the people who made this disappointing movie."
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking foward to this movie because I love Meryl Streep and I was interested to see the story of an important woman in history. While Streep's acting was great, the storyline was somewhat flat. It didn't illicit excitement, compassion nor admiration and to make the story more interesting they used that confusing camera movement that so many contemporary flimmakers use. It just seems to cover up the truth of this film, that it was boring.It could have been a wonderful film."
1,A Big Disappointment,This is another movie that I was anxiously waiting to get my hands on. I watched the DVD a couple of days ago and I have to say it was a complete let down. Meryl Streep is a fine actress but the storyline was very disappointing. I'm sure someone will make a better movie of the Iron Lady in the future.
2,A Missed Opportunity,"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. While Streep's performance was amazing I just shake my head at the approach of the filmmakers. A looming historical figure like Margaret Thatcher deserves a better film depicting her life.Like many other reviewers I grew weary of the hallucinations and would have preferred a simple telling of Lady Thatcher's fascinating life and politics. I never felt as if we got a chance to know anyone in the movie, including Thatcher herself. The only version we see consistently is the Thatcher suffering from dementia. I find that insulting.The movie glosses over most of her time in office as Prime Minister. Where was the Cold War? I believe the Falkland Islands got 5-7 minutes of screen time. Shocking!A sad telling of an incredible story."
1,Not about Thatcher but of an old woman with dementia,"Not a movie about Margaret Thatcher but of an old woman with dementia who lived through the Thatcher years. The reasoning and arguments for Thatcher's politics are never explored through constant, yet fleeting flashbacks to oppositional flashpoints in her career. Revelations of her intelligence, personality, character, wit, convictions, passions, and the whys of her political philosophy are all left unexamined. I learned zilch about the Iron Lady from this movie. Essentially a venue for Streep to pick up an oscar for effectively capturing some of the mannerisms of an aged Thatcher."
1,Disastrous and Unfair,"I was appalled by this movie. It did not accentuate Lady Thatcher's enormous accomplishments. Rather it emphasized her battle with Alzheimer's disease, portraying her as a lost soul. Very little time was give to show her indomitable spirit and patriotism. Shame on the producers for trying to make a conservative political figure so pathetic!"
1,Disappointment,"As others have said, Meryl Streep is a great actress. However, the film I believe had a political agenda. In sum, the film's message was that Mrs. Thatcher's efforts were a failure. It would have been interesting if the story took off from her father's forewarning of the post-war socialism emerging in Great Britain, and indeed throughout Europe now, and its current economic state. She wanted to reduce the climate of populace dependency and inspire citizens to be productive and contributors to the national economy. Mrs. Thatcher was a visionary and has left an enduring legacy whose efforts reestablished Britain as a world-power and improved its economic position. I was not impressed with this film."
1,horrid,Don't waste your time. I'm sitting here with my family; everyone had high hopes. Everyone hates it! Don't say you were not warned.
1,nothing like the origanal,"I was really bummed when I watched this movie, because I made it half way through before realizing that this was not a sequel to the movie Iron Man. It's not even a lame spin off. This movie sucks!"
1,Disappointed at treatment of Thatcher,"She accomplished so much, but this movie shows so little. It's as if they did a movie on Ronald Reagan and focused primarily on his late in life Alzheimer's."
3,Should be Streep's third Oscar!!,"Watching the movie, The Iron Lady, was only so-so. However, Streep's performance is worthy of an Oscar. Wasn't even sure it was she at the beginning of the film. Her portrayal of Thatcher is astonishing!!!! Truly, it's time to give her the award. Her last win has been almost thirty years ago for Sophie. She deserves the Oscar for this movie. She should have won many times before this. So let's see what the Academy Awards do this time!!!"
1,"Horrible, don't buy, don't rent.","If your looking for an historical ""Docu Drama"" DON'T bother with this movie, it was a horrible disappointment. Much of the movie was spent on scenes of ""MT"" in the last years of her life stumbling around her flat having visions of or being haunted by (who knows which) her long dead husband. The few interesting and historical moments that actually focus on the important parts of her life as a political person occur as flashbacks. All I could say was why did they bother? I can't believe Streep did this movie, it could have been so much more interesting. SKIP IT. On the bright side, there is STILL an opportunity for someone to make a good movie about the Iron Lady... this just isn't it. :)"
2,A bit disappointed.,"I admire Mrs Thatcher, very much. I found this to be very sad and a bit depressing. It's the way the writer and/or director chose us to view Mrs. Thatchers thoughts, ways and life style. I haven't read any memoires or other books about her, yet, but I would rather see her strong."
2,A Disappointment,"I was hoping for an enlightening bio of someone I have admired from afar and the prospect of Meryl Streep playing the part was to me particularly enticing. I was however, quite disappointed as I found the story line difficult to follow - choppy bits and pieces of scenes without sufficient followup or explanation. The method of telling the story set in the Iron Lady's old age with too many jolting back and forth flash backs to give a sense of what her life was really like is lame and ineffective. What a shame and a waste to treat such good subject matter poorly!"
4,Good movie,A little dry at times. Very insightful. I think would really appear to older audience. But should be seen by any teen or college age person.
4,"I'm not a fan of conservative politics, but this was a fine biopic.","Worth watching even if you are not a fan of Reagan and Thatcher. Meryl Streep is convincing in subtle ways. The story at first hints at, and then later clarifies the basis of her very conservative political philosophy which in the film is attributed to helping Brittan out of a severe economic recession."
3,Iron Lady Wonderful acting weak on content,I enjoyed this move mostly because the acting was superb. I was disappointed with the actual movie because I was hoping for more in depth analysis of her career. It might have been more satisfying if the movie concentrated a smaller part of her life and not just glimpses of her whole life.
2,Could have been much more better,The story has much more potential. I think the film is slow and sometimes boring. Without punch. I don't recommend it. I didn't like it.
1,A poor representation of a magnificent lady,"I found the movie to be very boring;you made her life seem so small. She was a wonderful lady with amazing accomplishments. Sorry,but you had so much to work with and came up with so little."
3,Meryl Rocks....but it's slow going,"Loved Meryl Streep's performance - no surprise there...but the story is written awkwardly. They should have spent more time on the film detailing Thatcher's early years and struggles. Perhaps due to Meryl's age at the time the movie was filmed, they didn't feel they could spend much time with the earlier years. The senile Thatcher sequences were increasingly depressing and the plot point needlessly belabored. But Meryl did a brilliant job with the portrayal. She just didn't have a lot to work with."
5,Iron Lady downloaded movie,"Meryl Streep is amazing in Iron Lady. A very good actress anyway, this is one of her best works.The point of view (recollections of an aged Thatcher) is genius; it makes the film pop. Thatchers aging is done with taste; nothing tacky.There are good history lessons: reminders of what has gone on. Seen from the British point of view. Make no mistake, this is a character study, not a history lesson - but you can't avoid seeing history when studying a former Prime Minister.The download from Amazon to TiVo was flawless. I ordered from the TiVo Search function, TiVo contacted Amazon ... later the movie was waiting for me on the TiVo. I don't know how long the download itself took: it probably did not occur within the next five minutes. I should pay attention, I guess."
3,Spectacular Opportunity Squandered,"While Meryl Streep was phenomenal the movie would have been better served with more substance while she was Prime Minister. She is young, she's old, her husband is alive, he's dead, she is in command then she is dotty, very annoying and disappointing. In the end, it would be a mistake to miss Streep at her very best."
3,"interesting, but not great","Be warned - this movie is not a full telling of her story. It is a non-linear reflection of choices made by this amazing woman against the backdrop of her senile senior years, in which she comes to realize what she gave up to pursue her chosen path. In short, she neglects her family to serve the free world. Only, the movie doesn't really develop the high points of her career - for example, the Falklands get some attention, but the Cold War is all but absent. I enjoyed the real-life footage that seems to have become standard fare for biopics these days, but I was disappointed at the lack of historical context for her achievements. At the end of her life, all she - and the viewer - is left with is a profound sense of regret and irony, with no recourse available. Perhaps other viewers had a better experience."
4,The Iron Lady,"I loved it. I felt Meryl Streep did such a good job I wasnt't seeing her. Once in a while I did. It of course had some long moments, but then again it was about a British woman. Ha! I loved seeing Margaret as a young girl. & thinking about the choices she made in life to get where she wanted. It want always pleasant. I really enjoyedit."
2,Disappointing,"Meryl gave her usual sterling performance with what she had to work with, which was not much. This should have been a really good story about a marvelous woman and her time in office, when she WAS the Iron Lady, not her older years and failing abilities. I found it sad and disappointing, not at all what was expected. The author did her a disservice by almost ignoring her accomplishments and focusing on the wrong part of her life."
1,What a disservice to a great leader in the free world.,"The Iron Lady was a poor representation of Margaret Thatcher's great accomplishments as a strong conservative leader from 1979 to 1990. Leave it to Hollywood and Meryl Streep to portray this great woman as a doughty old lady living with her memories of the past. Don't waste your time watching this movie if you want to learn about Margaret Thatcher during her three terms as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.Meryl Streep won the Oscar for her portrayal as Margaret Thatcher and I give Ms. Streep credit for her acting. Too bad The Iron Lady script didn't give the actress material to better portray this outstanding woman and her politial career. Perhaps, that was the goal for all involved."
3,Disappointed,I wished the movie had focused more on her accomplishments and less on her struggles after leaving office. Meryl Streep did and excellent job.
3,Ok but not great,Meryl Streep is really the only reason to watch this movie in my opinion. She makes you believe she really is Margaret Thatcher but otherwise a real snoozer. The other characters are one dimensional and uninteresting.
2,Whoever wrote the screenplay must've been on LSD!,"As has been reported many times before, this movie focused way too much on Margaret Thatcher's dementia. Regardless of how one might feel about Margaret Thatcher politically, she was coherent for most if not all of the time she was in office. All that said, Meryl Streep's portrayal was truly stellar and worthy of award! We rented this movie via Amazon ($2.00 cheaper than iTunes!) and I'm glad we did, as this is not the kind of movie I would ever want to see again. All in all, an unsatisfying piece of entertainment."
2,Boring,Couldn't believe that the story about such an important figure--the first and only woman prime minister of England focused on her delusional end! I doubt that much of it was even true. Was this in a way sexist? It reminded me how the rumor began that Thatcher and the Queen were very much at odds with each other. Both denied it. Thatcher said the story of two powerful women being at odds with each other was just too good not to make up. I think that pretty much applies to most of this movie. Streep of course was awesome. Not enough for me though to give this a pass.
3,A famous life in decline with flashbacks,Well acted and interesting historical content while depressing in tone. Set in the late years of mental decline and sad issues to be faced by a person of great historical stature. Numerous flashback stories of her early life and interest in politics at a young age. Much of the presentation dwells on the unhappy state of personal decline in her late years. Mental errors in her imagination play tricks with her memory.
3,Three,"No closed caption, hard to hear, do not like flashback movies, too much money for what you get Amazon needs to place high importance to getting the streaming movies with CC"
1,The BIG SNOOZE,"I very much like Meryl Streep, too, but this was one of the most BORING and negative films I've ever seen. I was determined to see it through to the end, but I was able to do so only by repeatedly putting it on ""pause,"" then leaving the room to wash dishes or make a snack or read my horoscope. The film's structure - incessantly jumping back and forth between Ms. Thatcher's memories and her present mental state - did not make the story any better or more interesting either. That technique just made it harder to follow the story. I understand that Ms. Thatcher was perceived as a leader and a very strong woman (iron-willed), but this film presented a very unflattering portrait of her as a selfish and self-centered woman, whose attitude seemed to be ""it's my way or the highway."" The way she dressed down Geoffrey Howe (Anthony Head) at a cabinet meeting was brutal, rude, and insensitive, and just plain bully behavior."
2,They should have called the movie the Crazy Lady,"The movie focused heavily on her dementia in later life and only outlined the challenges she faced as Prime Minister. Her time as PM was filled with dramatic events that could have made the movie compelling and yet they only outlined a few of them and hardly ever showed how she responded to those events. It felt like they were trying to marginalize her time as PM, and I never felt invested in the movie."
3,Snor-ing,"I love Streep and the makeup was superbly done but, unfortunatly, I could not recommend putting out good money on this one. Since I know Thatcher only from the newpapers I have no idea how much of her background protrayed here was true or fiction. Therefor, the low-key ""British-ness"" of this movie was very boring."
4,Meryl Streep is Awesome,"She never ceases to amaze me, the depth, the quality of her work. This woman is definitely one of the best, if not the best actor in Hollywood. I liked the film. I also liked the vantage point (from an elderly Thatcher), but I do wish that they would have gotten into a little more of the meat and potatoes of her career. I know that she was maligned, but it was not hard to dislike her, because there was no real reason to like her. There were no real contributions to her society highlighted. We all knew that she was a great Prime Minister because of her long tenure, so it would have been nice to see just why. As it was, the movie made her seem arrogant, insubstantial, mean and with no real depth. It was a beautiful movie, but I do wish that we could have learned a little more about Thatcher and her career instead of feeling, in the end, that she was the old, prudish harpy that the good old boys club warned everyone about."
1,"The makeup artists were good, but...","It seemed that the intent of the movie was to portray Lady Thatcher as little more than a power-hungry and selfish person who, as a conservative, was out of touch with everything and everybody. Rather than focusing on her accomplishments or place in history, most of the movie is devoted to alzheimer's disease. Kudos to the makeup artists. The rest was very disappointing."
4,I'm a fan of Thatcher,"For someone who is a fan of Thatcher, I deeply enjoyed this movie. I found that Thatcher's personality and accomplishments were captured well. Streep does an amazing job portraying the Iron Lady."
4,Meryl Streep nails it again,"I really liked the movie. I think that Streep is possibly one of the best actresses in the business. i did not like the particular choice of storytelling (a mechanism thing - using flashbacks to tell the story while tying it to the character's current wrestle with dementia). There was considerable debate as to whether the current portrayal was an accurate one. I think i would have enjoyed a different story mechanic. The mechanic notwithstanding, a very engaging (and in its own way, moving) story.Streep is clearly the reason this story is so powerful."
3,Great acting but not a good portrayal of Margaret Thatcher,"You can't blame Amazon for this one. If I was Margaret Thatcher I'd sue the producers!Yes, it flashes back into her past but since the majority of the scenes have her talking to her dead husband, Denis, she comes across as someone that has ""lost it.""There is very little recognition of Britain's first female prime minister, her trials, and accomplishments."
5,The Iron Lady,This was a great film-really enjoyed it-was easy for me to understand the lingo as I have been to England many many times-I have family there and I know the 'local' slang!!Would recommend it !
4,I loved this movie,I thought this was a great movie. I don't know how historically accurate it is--people seem to disagree on that and I'm not a history expert so I don't know. I thought the acting was great. I thought it showed the dilemma of being a woman in a male dominated time and career. It is not a fast action story but it is a great story. It was also inspiring to me.
4,Interesting,"Brilliant portrayal of Margret Thatcher. However, too much of the movie was spent depicting her later years as she suffers from mental decline and not enough telling us the story of her as Prime Minister. What's the point of dwelling on her as an elderly senile shell of her former self? Too bad, it could of been a wonderful movie, and about half of it is. The other half is simply pathetic.I give it 4 stars for the remarkable acting performance."
4,Maggie Would Not Approve,"I did not like this film. My rating is solely based on the performance of Meryl Streep. The woman's politics only brushed over and her dementia accentuated. What a terrible way to remember one of our political greats. I am an American. I subscribe to no particular party but find I am more liberal in many ways than not. Margret Thatcher was a woman to be admired. Remembered for her successes and failures. Her chances in politics where many and many that few men would have lacked the brass to stand and deliver. It is sad that this is how she is immortalized in film. It lacked Maggie's soul, her fire and her verve. I had such high expectations and hopes for this film only to be totally disappointed. I learned more about Margret Thatcher from documentaries than I ever could from this film. Sorry Maggie, I do not approve either."
1,Boring and very dry!,"Great storyline and acting. The wardrobe and sets are very good. The cast of actors is great! This is good entertainment to pass the time away. However, be prepared to be BORED out of your MIND!!! This is so slow and dry...make sure to have your pillow and blanket nearby, because you WILL fall fast asleep several times. Otherwise, the sound quality is good, with great cinematography. However, I recommend renting this one. Thanks."
3,Slow,"Love the content and of course, Meryl Streep knocks the role out of the park, but the content is pale."
1,Iron Lady,"This was the worse movie I have rented on the Kindle and was not worth getting for free, much less payuing for."
5,Wonderful film about an incredible woman,"Margaret Thatcher was an incredible woman and this is an incredible film. Meryl Streep is mesmerizing as Thatcher, and gives and Academy Award Winning performance."
2,Great Acting Horrible Movie,"We just watched this last night on Amazon streaming and I was so disappointed. Had Meryl not done such a phenomenal acting job I would have given this 0-1 stars. I expected this movie would bash Margaret Thatcher because she was head of the Conservative Party but this went beyond that. It was bizzare and almost Felliniesk with the whole movie revolving around her implied dementia and halucinations of her long dead husband. It never stopped.Here we have a movie about one of the strongest women of modern times rising up through an all boys club and becoming the longest reigning PM of Britian and all it want to show is her declining years in a delerium!?!?!? What is going on? I would have loved to have known how her career came about, who helped what brought her to her convictions, her relationship with Reagan. I could go on but what's the point. It was horrible and I cannot recommend this movie, despite the outstanding performance of Myrel Streep."
3,Not what I thought it would be at all.,I guess I should have read more about her before watching. Both my husband and I found it hard to follow. It seemed to be a story within a story within a story.
3,STREEP SHINES IN A DISAPPOINTING MOVIE,"While Meryl Streep deservedly won her third Oscar for her impressive performance as Margaret Thatcher, THE IRON LADY is a disappointing portrait of this historical figure.The script focuses on Thatcher's seeming decline into probable dementia accompanied by hallucinatory conversations with her dead husband (a charming performance by Jim Broadbent) rather than illuminating Thatcher's key political crises. This is all the more surprising since the director is a woman.Streep is as expected amazing. There are times it's hard to recognize the actress at all. THE IRON LADY ultimately emerges as a vehicle for a brilliant performer in a flawed movie."
2,Huge Disapointment!,This was poorly produce movie. The producer obvious intent was to make her look as bad as possible. They focused on the end of her life instead of the time she was in office. The political intent was obvious.
1,What a Confused and Bad Movie,"Why was this movie made? It is a confused jumble of scenes of Streep playing Margaret Thatcher as a long retired, senile eldely woman. That she was elected Prime Minister three times, survived IRA assassination attempts, was a long time friend and ally of President Ronald Reagan, is all relegated to the back third of the movie.This is arrogant Hollywood nonsense. If a ""biopic"" of Reagan or PM Tony Blair were treated this way, it would draw anger or laughter. Instead, Streep wins an Oscar for a farce.Whether the viewer was a supporter or opponent, she was a dominant political figure. You wouldn't know it from this mess. A younger generation will skip it all together having no idea what they are watching. What a missed opportunity.Maybe the backroom script battles should have been filmed instead."
2,"Good Story, Very Poor Presentation","Margaret Thatcher is a very interesting lady and her life is amazing. I don't mind movies that do flashbacks, but this one goes back-and-forth so much that a few times I wasn't sure where we were on the timeline. Confusing method of telling a great story."
1,Disrespectful Movie,Why does a movie about a great woman like Margaret Thatcher focus on the sad decline that occurs as a result of dementia? That's like making a movie about Alexander the Great and focusing the majority of the movie on his last days while dying in bed. A total waste of an opportunity to tell the story of one of the most influential people in the past 100 years while having at your disposal the services of perhaps the greatest actress of all time! The achievements of Margaret Thatcher and the pivotal moments in history that she helped shape should have been thoroughly explored so that current and future generations would have something to remember. That's how great movies are made. This was a complete disaster that trivializes a great woman.
5,Haven't watched it yet and can't rate it.,"As stated above, I haven't watched this movie. I love Margaret Thatcher and the clips I have seen of Meryl Streep portraying that role have been perfect."
2,The Iron Lady,"The content of the movie was very well done. The quality of the ""feed"" was less than acceptable. There were breaks in the video and audio. We became so annoyed at the broken up scenes, we went out and rented the movie from another provider. I'm assuming this was just a fluke. We will still rent from you again."
3,Too much Actress too little Thacher,Mostly a showcase for Meryl Streep and very little of Margaret Thatcher's remarkable place in history. The dynamic relationship between Ms. Thatcher and President Reagan was largely missing.
3,The Iron Lady,"This movie was just okay. Meryl Streep is fantastic, as always, but it would have been more interesting if the focus was more on Margaret Thacher's political life, her determination, role, etc. vs. her dementia."
2,The Iron Lady,This movie concentrates on an elderly Baroness Thatcher with flashbacks to her glory years as PM. Not terribly accurate at times. Is is likely that the Iron Lady would have so many regrets now when she seemingly had non during those years of civil unrest and cutbacks in Tory governed Britain? When she was powerful she steamed ahead and mowed everything in her path...
3,Fred,"As usual, a great acting performance by Merryl Streep, but I found the story and plot rather boring. History buffs will probably like it."
2,*eh*,"Don't really get a sense for Thatcher, except as a elderly woman struggling with Alzheimers. Whether or not one agrees with her politics (I don't), that's the real story."
4,Soild B,This was an interesting moving. Very well done. At first I almost turned it off as I felt so sorry for the old lady. But over the course of the movie I began to empathizes with her. I am glad I stuck with it.Great leadership points here. She was never one to form a coalition. It is interesting to see her stick to her guns in all situations. She was very black and white. My theory with women in power is that they are more principled and more likely to be a hard liner because they have a safety net. Married women can always return home. In her case she had a supportive husband at home. Men dont have that option. Chauvinist sure but true. As the movie shows the men are more interested in preserving their careers and don't have the luxury of principals. It is an old boy network for a reason. She rocked the boat and won...for a while.Over all a very interesting enjoyable movie.
2,Not what it seemed,"This was a surrealistic look at Margaret Thatcher and the trailer is totally misleading. It cut in and out of her life which I suppose was as an elderly woman, portraying her somewhat with dementia and delusions with some info from flashbacks? to the time that she was Prime Minister and how she got there. There were four of us watching this we all came away wondering what that was about. It felt like a Dali painting you know its supposed to be a woman but the parts are all over the place.Margaret Thatcher was a fascinating woman she deserved better....Meryl Streep, the real selling point in the trailer was, as usual fabulous."
4,"Hollow, but still entertaining.","As everyone else has already said, Streep and other Actors are great, what lacks is a story.Here you have one of the most provocative women of the 20th Century and they still managed to screw it up.They spent way too much time on who she is now instead of who she was when.........Hopefully years from now, someone will do Maggie justice and cover her in more depth; whether you agree with what shedid or not, I'd still like to hear her side and know what made her who she was....perhaps her family won't allow an in-depth until she has passed....Anyway, a shadow of what it could have been."
3,If you like historical films...,"Meryl Streep gives yet another Oscar-worthy performance as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady. I appreciated the historical biopic of the film, as Thatcher's political persona has always been a bit controversial. I loved the flashbacks which gave the viewer insight into Thatcher's childhood and early political career. All in all, a satisfying film with a good supporting cast and Streep's unfailing talent."
3,Boring....,"Did I say boring already? There are just some days you want to sit down and watch something that is entertaining. I found this to be rather slow and boring. There was nothing in this movie that captivated me. Acting was good and as usual, Meryl Streep captured the role, but it just didn't have any bells or whistles for me...."
3,"Great performance, subpar story","Streap desereved The Oscar for this performance, the story was flat and boring. The simply was not any depth or development, giving turbulant times."
3,Streep is the only real attraction,Streep's performance is the main attraction in this otherwise rather uninteresting biopic. The constant shifting from present to past is more of a distraction than a clever device. When exactly did her husband die? In the explosion? Why did we not see more of her son and his family? Why is her daughter barely there?
1,waste of time,"This movie is so disappointing..i was looking forward to seeing this movie because I admire Margaret Thatcher so much. I was disappointed in Meryl Streep for portraying Margaret Thatcher as a demented old woman, instead of the strong world leader that Margaret Thatcher was. It is disgusting to me to see Margaret Thatcher portrayed this way. Hollywood obviously disliked Margaret Thatcher's conservative politics so they chose to portray her this way. It shows how morally bankrupt Hollywood is when they cannot tell the truth about one of the truly great women leaders in the history of the world."
2,A missed opportunity,"The movie had a lot of promise but essentially fails if its task is to provide a fair portrayal of the former U.K. prime minister Thatcher. Ms. Thatcher's accomplishments are substantial and have influenced the world greatly. The movie's primary focus is her battle with Alzheimer's and the movie is a series of flashbacks as perceived through the veil of the illness. Why the illness is so important to the movie maker, I am not sure but I can only suspect a desire to diminish the stature of the prime minister or of her accomplishments. A chronological movie would have been a much more accurate portrayal. Mere minutes are spent on key events such as the battle of the Falklands, the end of cold war, and many others.Meryl Streep does a good job in her role as Ms. Thatcher as she often does in any role.You might find some nuggets of value in this movie but don't make it your sole source of information about Margaret Thatcher."
1,Boring telling of a great story,"Marget Thacher is a woman of thinking and action. Yet this movie is all idle talk and superficial feeling. This movie is the opposite of who she is. She was the first woman head of state of an industrialized country. Yet, most of this movie takes place in the present, long after she has left office, when she is suffering from dementia. It is so far off the true story that I can not help but see it as a blatant attempt to discredit her."
1,Not so Good,This woman is a very interesting person but this movie did not do her justice. Merle Streep as always is one fantastic actor.But I would not recommend this movie if asked.
3,Movie,It was an ok movie but not really up to par. Just like any other movie out there think of J. Edgar. Those types of movies are just ok.
3,The movis is okay,"The movie was okay; the movie was a little slow and seemed to drag on and on and on. A lot of flash backs. Instead of focusing on Margaret Thatchers life after her role as prime minister, I would have liked for the movie to focus more on what the prime minister did during her tenure as prime minister."
4,A Gripping Autobiography,"The Iron Lady was very entertaining in that it documented the life of Margaret Thatcher from her humble beginning as a shop keeper's daughter to the most powerful woman in the free world. This documentary took us back to the time when we lived in England and went through the brownouts, threat of bombings and protests of the times."
5,The Iron Lady,"I was not expecting this movie to be as good as it was. the only reason this movie held high standards was because of meryl streeps performance. what happened to actors like her. did they fall of the face of the planet. Meryl streep is a good character performer. i saw a video of the real thatcher and i could not tell the diffrence between them, the same way with julia and julia she was julia childs. Meryl streep deserved an oscar for this movie. if she was not in it i think this movie would of been a big flop. this movie is awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do"
2,lousy screenplay,"Streep does what she can with this turkey, but it is ridiculous to me that most of this movie seems to portray Thatcher suffering from dementia, with often out of context, unrelated, confusing flashbacks to parts of her career. This was a woman who, if a film was to be made of her, deserved to have her astounding accomplishments displayed in a coherent fashion, rather than this crazy quilt/broken mirror set of glimpses around a framework of a doddering aged dementia.Maybe it is worth a rental, but not a purchase"
2,Pathetic,"Rather than telling the story of Margaret Thatcher's life, it concentrates on the present day, when she is suffering from dementia, with flashbacks to the past. The story could have been much better told. Disjointed and uninteresting."
3,Too many time changes,"I was disappointed with the film. The transitions between the present and the past for Margaret Thatcher left me confused. Was it intended to show the confusion she was living with? I don't know, but to me the many movements from one time frame to another distracted me from the story itself."
2,"Good actress, bad movie","This movie was such a disappointment. The script was lame , with such an interesting subject and great actress, what happened????????Meryl Streep did win the oscar and I thought she deserved it. There was way too much ""jumping around."""
3,Not what I expected,"Great story, but focuses more on the decline due to aging than the political accomplishments. For such a great historical figure is should be more thought provoking. Rather is seemed more like a flash back episode of ""FRIENDS"" when the had no new footage to use. Meryl was outstanding, her best role yet."
2,Deprssing treatment of dementia,"I thought I was going to watch a movie about Margret Thatcher, but that came in second to a real depressing look at a woman losing her mind. The movie focuses more on her ""relationship"" with her dead husband. Sorry, I really needed a different movie. It seems like every aspect of her character is loosing it. One cannot focus on her life or actions."
1,Streep's Brilliance Cannot Salvage a Tin Movie,"One of the worst motion pictures to receive an Oscar of any kind. Meryl Streep's award-winning portrayal cannot save ""The Iron Lady"" (2011) from its bad filmmaking technique. Pretentiously directed, clumsily scripted and choppily edited, this cinematic travesty does a tremendous disservice to Margaret Thatcher and Streep's remarkable talents. A squandered opportunity to capture the life and times of Britain's first woman prime minister."
1,Dull but biased,"Interesting take on one of the most powerful (and polarizing) persons of her time. M. won the oscar, but I feel it was for politics not the body of work. Also more in bad taste to attack someone living in such a manner."
1,BORING Amazon Purchase,"Despite the talent of Meryl Streep and the many other performances which I have enjoyed by her, I was totally disapointed. This movie does not live up to the rave reviews received by many. I was also disappointed with the historical aspect of this film, where there appears to be great spans of Mrs. Thatcher's life omitted with way too much attention towards her decling years. The Devil Wears Prada still remains my favorite Streep movie."
3,Love Letter To Maggie?,"Meryl Streep is the world's greatest actress, but Margaret Thatcher is unworthy of such a tribute.1 sentence, say no more."
2,Boring movie,I found the approach of focusing on an elderly Margaret Thatcher in her declining years and flashing back to events in her life very unpleasant and disjointed. This was a Lady who had an enormous effect on her country and it would have made a compelling film to present her life story in a normal progression with minimal emphasis on her post prime minister days.
2,Frustrating and Disturbing,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. It has some great moments, but the whole movie revolves around MT's dementia and it moves at an agonizing pace. After the first ten minutes you want to tell the director, ""okay Maggie is getting old and her mental faculties are no longer 100% we get it, move on"" but the movie continues to bludgeon you with it in almost every scene. Another issue I had was there were some attempts at cinematic imagery, that were unevenly applied. When combine those with the constant portrayal of MT's dementia it was very difficult to figure out what was supposed to be historical and what was the director attempting to be ""artful"". Great sets, good acting, mediocre cinematography, substandard plot and metering."
1,The lost time and money I will not get back,"I had to stop watching and walk away. I was very disappointed, I was expecting so much more. SInce the Oscar was won. Sorry, it was a very undeserving win. I am upset with the voters for making me think the movie was worth watching. It was disjointed, slow and hard to follow. It was a waste of an opportunity to show why she was the Iron Lady, all I saw was a sad confused alone woman, who talked to her dead husband, whom we had a hard time following was not there. Do not waste your time or money watching this bomb. Shame on the academy for giving this movie any Oscars, I wil not believe them any longer. It was for the actress, not the role or movie"
3,Could have been so much more,"Margaret Thatcher was such a huge figure in British politics and for, whatever reason, the filmmakers decided to focus on her latter years and her battle with dementia. AND they didn't even do that well.That is not to say that Meryl Streep doesn't do a fabulous job because she does - as always. Watching her in this film WAS like watching Thatcher herself. But I was hoping for so much more - an in-depth look at Thatcher's service to her country and the changes she helped bring about. That didn't happen and I was disappointed.It's worth watching ""Iron Lady"" just to see Streep's performance but I wouldn't watch it for a history lesson."
3,The Iron Lady,"The best part of this movie for me was Meryl Streep. Her acting was, as always, great. The story was boring."
2,Disappointing and straining...,"A woman in leadership...a twenty year tenure...One would expect that a movie chronicling Margaret Thatcher could have come off more fair, more wide scoped, with more scene clarity.There is no doubt that Meryl Streep astounds with her broad character portrayals.However, the whole movie left a very down and pathetic portrayal of a woman, who had to have had some ingenious, often tenuous, qualities, insights and talents to get her to the top of the politcal spectrum.What was viewed was often a pathetic, innocuous, straining depiction. This should have been more."
2,Sqaundered Opportunity,"Such a waste of resources! Maggie Thatcher is one of my heroes and I was so looking forward to seeing at least a semi-accurate portrayal of her by Hollywood's most accomplished actress. What I saw instead was a dispiriting depiction of a mere shadow of the ""Iron Lady"". For the first 20 minutes of the film we must endure an image of the stooped, aged, confused figure of the former Prime Minister wandering from room to room and trying to outwit her keepers for the occasional solo stroll to the corner convenience store. I breathed a sigh of relief when the film finally transitioned to a younger portion of her life. But the respite was frustratingly brief. The film continued its bewildering ""ping-pong"" format throughout to its vacuous conclusion. I don't mind flashbacks, but this film is a haphazard muddle of fact and fancy that pays little or no homage to the towering historical figure of the great lady its title purports to depict."
2,Disappointing,"I am disappointed at the ""perspective"" the movie was made from. The film missed the chance to due justice to one of our times bravest ladies and insteadDiminished her by looking at her life from her most vulnerable time."
4,Another triumph for Meryl,"One cannot watch a Meryl Streep movie without wondering how she is able to portray so many different people so well. She definitely is a ""one-of-a-kind"" actress! I have so many of her movies and love her acting. The movie story is okay, but the acting makes up for it. Great movie for Streep lovers!"
3,Great acting bad script,Meryl Streep's performance is almost worth watching this movie on it's own but the script's portrayal of Margret Thatcher was very week I suggest getting a good book if you are looking for any serious representation of the Iron Lady.
3,Not What I Expected,"I was expecting the movie to be more about her time as the Prime Minister, however much of the movie is focused on here failing mental state which was kind of sad. As usual Meryl Streep is phenomenal."
2,Hit job,"An emphsis on her illness and not on her great accomplishments. Meryl was good, but the script was not good."
2,Disappointing,The acting in this movie was fine. Did not like the flashback style as there was little connection between the past and present scenes. Do not recommend spending the 2 hours needed to watch this movie.
2,Hard to follow,"This movie is made up of a bunch of flashbacks, but they are not in chronological order. It keeps jumping around to different parts of her life in a random order. I am not a history buff, so it was difficult for me to follow and know what was going on in the movie. My husband loves history and enjoyed the movie much more than I did because he could follow along, but since this is my opinion I only gave it two stars. He probably would have given it four."
3,There was something missing.,"It's true, Meryl Streep gives a brilliant performance in this film. From all the film footage of Margaret Thatcher that I've seen over the years Ms Streep's depiction of the first and only woman to be Prime Minister of England was dead-on. Bravo! However a film is a sum of all its parts, not just one player in it. If more care had been taken with the story to make it more riveting, perhaps I would have enjoyed it more. Also, the fact that the film is told from the perspective of flashbacks from a senile Margaret Thatcher was almost, in my opinion, unflattering to her. The film is called The Iron Lady yet they chose to show her at her weakest moments: having hallucinations about her dead husband, Denis. Denis was charmingly portrayed by Jim Broadbent. I don't want it to seem as if I'm bashing the entire film because I'm not. The other actors gave solid performances as well as Ms Streep. I especially enjoyed seeing Anthony Head in a film again."
1,Disappointment,"I love Meryl Streep and she certainly did a great job of a sorry script. The Prime Minister deserved better than this horror. Little ""jump-cut"" scenes. First you see her with old age dementia and then you snap back to an earlier year. Back and forth the entire movie. When I first heard of this movie I couldn't understand why it didn't win best movie Oscar. Now I think they owe Meryl Streep for even getting in the list. Meryl Streep and Margaret Thatcher are both better than this movie allowed them to be..... and it was depressing"
1,Sad,"The most predominant image left in my mind after watching this film is of an aged Thatcher (Streep) staring ahead looking bewildered & weak, again & again & again (like this point wasn't made the first time). I knew very little about Margaret Thatcher before watching The Iron Lady & was hoping for a much better historical account of her place in Brittish & world politics. Politics aside, she was a strong & remarkable woman. I feel terribly sad for her that a film maker chose her dementia to be the most intriguing tale of her life.To be honest, I wish I had never watched this film."
2,Hammy and Boring,Julia Childs is haunted by the ghost of Bud Melman (or was that Harry Carray?) and dreams about being the PM in the UK. Overacting meets overarching melodramatic plot device. Snoozer.
4,I expected better,"While Meryl did a good job acting, I couldn't get into the movie. Guess I really didn't know as much as I thought about Margaret Thatcher!"
2,"Streep Is Excellent, The Blu-ray Is Not","A surprisingly short film, given the remarkable life of Ms. Thatcher.Subtract, further, huge chunks in which a challenged elderly womandodders about her empty house, and there isn't much history to see.(Streep does it beautifully...but oh, what MT's life story COULD've been!)So this would've been 3 stars, except for the horrible, horrible""extras."" I usually check Hi-Def Digest, when trying to decide if a blu-rayis worth buying, over an upscaled DVD, but I didn't this time, figuringthat a blu-ray package about such a historical figure would surely includesome interesting stuff. Wrong. One decent 12 minute ""Making of..."" not bad,but not much. Then, inexcusably, embarrassingly short ""featurettes"" thatare worse than worthless, because they 90% re-run pieces of the Making of!Horrible time wasters. So there's 3 discs for 1 short movie and almost nobonus stuff (not even a director's commentary!). Streep-a-holics only!"
3,Good story,"It was enlightening. Kind of slow at times, but I was in the mood to sit and watch, so okay.Meryl Streep is always excellent!"
2,Wasn`t to happy about the movie,"Wasn`t too happy about the movie, it was bit too much drama and not enough about her own life. The actor was wonderful."
4,Iron Lady,"Mery Streep gives an awesome performance as usual in this film. In Iron Lady, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is an elderly woman who suffers with dimentia. In her mental state, she frequently converses with her beloved deceased husband when no one is nearby to overhear. The movie flashes back and forth from present day to earlier times and touches on her personal life as well as her political ambitions. Scenes from her formative years as the daughter of a grocer give glimpses into the formation of her political thought. It was in this environment that she learned firsthand the value of a hard earned dollar. No doubt, that life experience contributed to her grit as an adult. The movie may be lackluster for some but I enjoyed seeing the old girl again via Meryl Streep."
1,ABSOLUTE RUBBISH,"Here is a great lady, who made great contributions to her country and the world. Approximately two-thirds of this movie is absolute dribble about Margaret seeing her dead husband, forgetting who she is, where she is or what day it is. There is precious little in this film that really focuses on her great accomplishments. Today, we in America need heroes and heroines. It appears that the job of Hollywood is to do all they can to diminish anyone we could look up to. The same happened in the movie ""J Edgar"" where the main focus of the movie was on him being gay and dressing up in women's clothes. It appears that anyone who has done great things, Hollywood makes movies about them to totally discredit them as human beings in an effort to smear those who we could look up to as our heroes or heroines. Hollywood: Shame on you!!"
3,Meryl Streep great in a so-so movie,"I love biographical movies and enjoy Meryl Streep's work. She certainly lives up to the Academy Award she received for her performance, but the overall movie was not nearly as good as I expected it to be. There is too much about Margaret Thatcher as an elderly woman, after she was no longer Prime Minister, and not nearly enough of her while she was in office. The plot was not very good, and the overall experience was a disappointment."
2,Great Poetential,"When I heard this movie was coming out, I could not wait to see it; I am a big fan of both Thatcher and Streep. When I did, I was left completely disappointed. The few scenes we do get of Thatcher during her meteoric rise and her years as prime minister were excellent but the problem is that the movie is told in flashbacks. When you watch the trailer for the movie the scenes shown which portray her career are excellent but sadly this amounts to no more than 25% of the total film, the majority of the film deals with how Thatcher is today, suffering from dementia; not exactly what is portrayed in the film's trailer.No doubt that Streep is excellent in the film and deserves the Oscar as her portrayl is very good but her talent alone is not enough to save the movie from a really sub par script. I wouldn't purchase this movie, and as much as I wanted to like it I didn't. I would visit Blockbuster to rent the film if you still want to see it then decide for yourself."
2,just didn't like it,No big spoilers here... Movie starts after she stepped down from being PM. The whole movie was a series of retrospectives/flashbacks from that. I just didn't like it. Thought it would have been more effective if it had been a normal movie without flashbacks.
1,one star for streep,"streep shines, but as a movie this is labour propaganda and a shameless abuse of one of freedom's greatest heroes."
1,Gravely disappointed,"I was really looking forward to this movie to get the back story behind the achievements of this remarkable woman: How she got into Oxford (a woman!) in the 50s, how she graduated from one of the toughest universities in the world, how she broke into the man's world of British politics, became prime minister, and how she turned around a country on the brink of bankruptcy. Unfortunately, none of this story was told. Half the movie was spent on hallucinations the filmmakers attributed to her later years. What about her life! They even glossed over her intense relationship with US President Ronald Reagan with nothing more than a dance. I was gravely disappointed."
2,"An impersonation, not a movie.","""The Iron Lady"" is merely a mediocre, soulless highlights reel of Margaret Thatcher's life, lacking any substance or narrative cohesion. It's a platform for Streep's admittedly top-notch impersonation. I say ""impersonation"" rather than ""performance' because the complete lack of depth to the film gives her no character arc and no dimension. It's Oscar bait at its least satisfying. You'll get more insight into Thatcher by reading her Wikipedia entry, and there's nothing in Streep's performance you didn't see in her Oscar clip. Check out an old episode of ""Spitting Image"" instead for a far more interesting take on Thatcher."
1,Another partisan hack job out of Hollywood,"Meryl Streep revising history and doing a hack job on one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century. Unfortuanately, Hollywood types are incapable of producing anything without their political slant. Such a waste of money and actress who is technically good, but can't let go of her politics to make a good movie. She had the opporunity to make a great moview but ended up making a obvious hack job."
1,Horrid portrayal,"This is one of the worst movies ever made about Lady Thatcher. It portrays her as an almost insignificant and pitiful weak woman who is out of her mind. Further, her actions with Reagan to bring about the end of the cold war are all but unmentioned. Rather, the writer and director go out of their way to make her look irrelevant. This is, in no uncertain terms, an abomination on film. One of the worst movies I have ever sat through. I would give it NO stars...but that is not an option."
2,Good actress bad plot,Great actress in a bad plot. Feel asleep in 20 minutes. I watched this with my 33 year old son and my 25 year old daughter and they both went to bed on it.
2,"Why did they dwell on this period of the Iron Lady""?","So very disappointed. They could have glorified this great lady and global leader, but they blew it badly. How very sad to miss the opportunity."
3,The Iron Lady -NOT,I grew up in England during Margaret Thatcher's brutal tyranny and persecution of miner's and working class families and this film does not portray her brutality and insensitivity at all! She is portrayed in such flattering terms that it made me angry. So many English people suffered under her Iron rule and she was widely hated by working class and middle class citizens. I love Meryl Streep and watched the film because she was in it but I was deeply disappointed. The acting was good but don't watch this film and think that's the true Margaret Thatcher - it's the Hollywood version.
4,"Not a docudrama, but a touching story.","Critics don't like this movie because they expect it to dwell at length on the political philosophy and on the issues Margaret Thatcher dealt with as prime minister of Britain. They expect the Iron Lady to be a glorified docudrama, but that is not what this film is. It is the story of the personal life of Margaret Thatcher before, during, and after her tenure as prime minister. By that measure, and by virtue of Meryl Streep's acting skill, it is a jolly good show."
4,Meryl Streep WOW,Wow what an actress! Meryl Streep has done it again!!! By far the best actress of the day. She did a wonderful job. Loved the movie and the way they portrayed Margaret Thatcher. Bravo!
3,A Disappointment,"Acting is excellent as the story of an aging person of note is portrayed by Streep. If you hoped for more of Margaret Thatcher's role as Prime Minister...it is not here. The lack isfrom the screen writer; the excellence from Meryl, whose did a fabulous job with thematerial she was given. Received the DVD quickly after ordering it from Amazon. If you arean acting student...it is great study of aging. If you liked Margaret Thatcher's role on theworld scene...it is a major 'skip."
2,The Iron Lady,Merly Streep is excellant in this movie. I didn't find it that interesting in it's story of her life. Shifting back & forth from her early days to current events was not a format I liked.
2,Missed the point,"Good production values, well acted. Disappointed in the story line - spent too much time about her problems with Alzheimer's and not enough details on her extraordinary political career."
2,The Iron Lady,This movie should never have been released while she was still living. It made her look crazy and I dont blame her or her kids for not wanting to ever see it.
2,Terrible script... Great acting.,I lived in England during the Thatcher years (as a child) and have some memories of the poll tax riots and such so I was looking forward to a story about the Iron Lady. instead the movie focuses on the shell of the Iron lady. Very little substance to this movie. I would not recommend this movie unless you want to see some good acting about dementia/delirium.The analogy to this would be a movie about Reagan that spent 3/4 of it showing him unable to take care of himself. Many of us may lose our mental faculties one day and I would hope that our children would not focus on that.
3,The Iron Lady,The movie is good.Not too biased considering it was made( by?) with liberal thinking actors. Make up was outstanding. Meryl Streep was made to look just like Lady Thatcher.
2,"Great acting, not much more","Acting is great, but we can assume that with Ms. Streep. The story was not compelling. They do some artsy-fartsy movie stuff with Thatcher talking to her dead husband. This is fine if the rest of the movie is interesting - but it isn't. The politics are not interesting, the characters are not interesting and there is no story of interest to follow. I fell asleep half way through."
2,"Agree with the bulk of reviewers: Streep = A, Movie = C-","This movie uses the fairly common framing device of telling the story via flashbacks from the viewpoint of the aged subject of the film. In this case, I agree with many reviews that far too much of the movie focuses on the elderly, dementia afflicted Thatcher and not nearly enough on her achievements in rising to be the first female Prime Minister of Great Britain. Whether this was politically motivated or simply an artistic choice to focus on the more intimate, poignant end of life for a power figure, I don't know, but the movie suffered for it. It's unavoidable to compare and contrast this with other recent bio-pics of 20th century British figures such as The King's Speech and The Queen, which both come off FAR more cohesively than this fragmented film does.Streep gives her usual fantastic performance of course, but I wish I'd read reviews before watching this to at least be prepared for a huge disappointment."
2,SLOW odd film,This movie was very slow and strange with Lady Thatcher's hallucinations of her deceased husband. Brilliant performanance by Meryl. Not really an exciting film of Thatcher's life to watch.
1,Confusing,"This book offers answers at the back of the book but no explanation for how the answers were formulated. Don't know what formulas to use for what, and some of the review questions seem to not correspond to the sections they are located. This is a terrible book."
2,Really disappointing...,"I was a real fan of Profs.Wonnacotts earlier books. I had used their books on Introductory Statistics 1969 edition, Regression and Econometrics for my graduate class and they were really lucid and helpful. So, when I ordered the latest version of `Introductory Statistics' thinking that it would be better, I was really disappointed. Every chapter is interrupted repeatedly and the flow is not maintained. I must say I actually ended up confused after reading this book (and I have studied the same material before - although from the earlier version). In their rush to print a new version of their book, the authors have simply garbled their original work. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. If you have a tough time with Statistics, I would refer the 1969 edition (ISBN-10: 0471959650)"
1,The worst book ever written on the subject!,"This is the worst book ever written on the subject. Professors often assign it, but students hate it. The author tried to cramp too much in the book, withough adequate explanation. The material is presented the worst way possible."
4,honorable scholar,"One can look at this scholar with his fly whisk and imagine such must have been Confucius. It is excellent work as a mud figure. The Chinese have this art down well with all the centuries they have put into it. It is larger than the other mud figures in my collection, which began in 1939, but that distinguishs it."
4,un tour de force musical,"Voici un album super ! Enchanting voice, beautiful lyrics and haunting music. There are just one or two songs that I'm not crazy about, but the rest is great! However, other than a couple of songs that are fantastic on this album, I prefer ""Immobile."""
4,Interesting Aural Experiments,"If you already know Autour de Lucie, put Immobile out of your mind immediately. Whilst the opening track, ""Je reviens"" has a similar sound to the tracks on Immobile, the similarities stop there. The band experiments with new instruments and sounds on the balance of the album. For me, it works. It is a trippy, yet edgy melange of sounds. Within the experimentation are some exquisitely catchy melodies. It doesn't all work, but I got the feeling that the band is testing new boundaries. It has all of the melodic pop sensibilites that made Immobile such a suprisingly fresh album. Some of the stronger tracks are ""Je suis un balancier"" and ""Sans Commentaire""."
1,Too Small,I need to return the items. My wife has a terminal disease and takes large dosages of multiple medications. Years ago I purchased the same product as displayed at a Nationally known pharmacy. Imagine my surprise when the item arrived and I learned the manufacture decreased the sizes of the pill cases by 40%. They are useless unless I want to not give my wife a number of the medications she uses each day for her illness. I need to figure out how to return the four items purchased.
3,postage will kill you,The product was fine but it could have been put in a box from the post office for half the price.Therefore I think I was over charged for postage
3,Misleading,This is actually 2 shows on one tape and both are not complete. One is part of the Wolf Trap show (which is already available) and the other is from an Austin City Limits show in which the picture quality is bad. It seems to have taken from an old VHS tape. 8 tracks from Wolf Trap and 5 from AustinHowever that said the tracks from Austin are not currently available on dvd so in that case it is worth getting it from the UK Amazon site where it is available for under $10.
3,Helpful but not complete,"I'm satisfied with the manual in that it's well worth what I paid (about $24US). But I wish it covered more topics -- routine stuff like how often to change the oil. I'm in the market for another manual but this one will be helpful. BTW, I have a Kubota L1500."
4,owners manual,It shows all the instructions and parts required to make proper repairs. It is well worth the money because you can fix it right the first time.
3,Not exactly what I expected,"The book has some information on all models listed but not a lot of detail on each. This is no fault of the seller, the book is in great shape and will stay in my library."
3,"Great Mythology, But a Storie that drags on.","If you like Norse Mythology and if you enjoy reading historical fiction pick this book up and don't put it down. The elves in the book were wonderfully well developed as well as Tomas the Rymer, and even the other characters. For these reasons I continued to read one of the slowest and most boring stories ever!!!! Again, if you like wonderfully developed charicters and historically acurate and depictate peoples and mytholoagy the go for it, but for a 50+ chapter book, even small chapters, the story drags and could be sumed up in about half the chapters."
5,2000 Honda Insight KN filter,"Once again, KN delivers a great product at a great price. I've seen my gas mileage increase by 3 to 5 MPG just because of this filter and I easily get 53 to 56 MPG doing the speeds necessary on the freeways here in California. This was also my first time ordering from Amazon and I must say the shipping and ordering process was very easy and secure. Thanks Amazon for the great pricing and shipping speed!"
5,Another Insight Success Story!,"Like Brian, I put this filter on my 2001 Insight, and my fuel economy has improved at least 2-3 mpg. I check my mileage at every fill-up and so take notice when there is any change (you tend to get that way when you're Trying to break your last mileage record almost evert time you drive). I was somewhat skeptical buying a K&N, as I've heard opinions all along the spectrum, but I have to say I'm impressed. I will also say that my Insight is very sensitive to even small changes like that; it will be interesting to try one on my SUV to see if I get a similar result. I will add to this review if I end up doing so."
2,A Dissapointment,"This book is very disappointing in that it shows little of the man. It can be a mild romp through memory lane of occasionally funny anecdotal tales, but I found it lacking in spirit and soul. Yes, he can be self-depreciating but you never get an idea who the real Michael Crawford is! Perhaps, art imitates life and Mr. Crawford is hiding behind his Phantom's mask, only showing what he wants you to see and not what is really there. After reading this book, one may ask the question: Who was that masked man?"
2,Baffled by the Phantom,"Gee, is it just me, or do I need to study two forms of English to understand books nowadays? Interestingly, the copy of Michael Crawford's autobiography that I read was an English printing and utilized words and phrases that may as well have been Greek as far as my understanding of them went. That said, I can't recommend much about this book other than the beginning, where some good detail was given on the actor's early years. I was especially looking for some good stories about the making of ""Hello, Dolly!"" but that experience was pretty much given short shrift in the book. What I found consistently dull was the actor's frequent references to sexual matters and certain bodily functions which I found neither amusing nor interesting, certainly not topics that you would enjoy sharing with several million people whom you don't know. Sorry, Michael, the story of your life and career could have been much more interestingly told."
2,Antiquated text has been long surpassed...,"There is no reason to inflict this text on yourself. If you are looking for a primer, or at least a solid piercing of the semiological membrane, there are far superior works, such as the wonderful Semiology: The Basics by Daniel Chandler or Structural Poetics by Culler. This book, it seems to me, was meant as a fast and loose refrence for a class or a seminar: it rarely defines its terms, it seems disorganized and it is very dry, just listing method without any reason why one should be interested. The other two books, in particular Basics, were written long after Elements and thus are much more incompassing, including theory and practice, and Basics by Chandler even has a glossary at the back. Bartes may be the man, but this is definitly not the book; but, if your a Bartes completist, already well initiated into the world of Semiology and Structuralism, then by all means pick it up. Anyone else, steer clear."
4,"So far, okay","The battery fit easily into my ipod w/ no problems, and appears to be working fine. My concern is that the date on the battery was 2007, that would have been information I would have considered when ordering. Two years old, doesn't sound like it was new to me. But, I live in Hawaii, and it's not easy locating a battery for an ipod; so, I'm crossing my fingers all will go well and this replacement will give me my money's worth."
1,Didn't Work For My Mini..,"The reviews on this product were pretty positive, so I thought I'd give it a shot. The directions were easy enough to follow, but I had to chip up the cover a bit in order to get the top and bottom open with the instrument they provided. In the end, the new battery never worked. After charging it in the wall, the screen would just blink if I plugged it into my computer, and the iPod itself would never turn on. I think I was better off beforehand. At least my old battery gave me a couple hours of playtime."
4,A review by Mona Nightshade,"Tony is a boy that has never done anything ecxeptional.His father tells him that his parents are going on a bike tour of Europe, and Tony will have to stay on a farm (with pigs) with his aunt and uncle. He thinks he will have a rotten time, but one day he spots a black fox. She immediately becomes the highlight of his summer.One day danger comes between them. Can Tony face his fears in time to save her?"
5,"A nice story, told wonderfully and described beautifully","This is a wonderful story of a young city boy who learns something about nature, and himself, during one summer on a farm. All of the descriptions in the book are excellent, especially Tom's first encounter with the fox and the climax. I read this book for a Children's Literature class I'm taking for my teaching degree, and I will definitely have it in my own classroom library."
2,Midnight Fox,Bryn writes:This book is written by Betsy Byars. It is about a boy named Tom who is on vacation with his aunt and uncle who own a farm. One day they spot foxes. The aunt and uncle decide they have to kill the foxes so they don't eat any of their animals. Tom try's to save the foxes from his aunt and uncle. Tom is a city boy and turns to love his uncle's farm. I give this book two stars because this book is very dull and boring since the characters are not fun and not much happens throughout this book. I would not read this book but if you want read it in 3rd grade and up since it is easy to understand.
4,kay's midnight fox review,"midnight fox Tom lives in the city and he's not looking forward to spending the summer holidays on his uncles farm.However he learns how to love the farm when he finds a black fox living in the woods.But his uncle fred wants to kill the fox and tom is determined to help save her because he loves her the boy don't know want her name is.Tom said to his uncle ""your not killing her"" ""shut up""said his uncle. thats my favorite bit because they get into a proper conversation finally he gives in tom gets his own way. i enjoy reading reading the midnight fox it was great i could read it over and over again.from kayleigh masonp.s. read youll love it"
4,"If You Can Handle Confusion,Read This Book!","If you can handle a lot of confusion, read The Midnight Fox. This book is really confusing because there are a lot of characters and to find out the other reason read this book!This book is really interesting and exciting. You'll be thinking,"" What's going to happen"" repeatedly. It's about a boy who doesn't care about animals too much until he meats this thing...I hope you read this book, all because I didn't like it doesn't mean you shouldn't."
5,A superb album that never made the big time.,I've waited for Rebel to come out on CD for so long. I'm glad I can retire the record album from 1976. Miles' musical range is amazing and Rebel is full of songs that should have become classics. (They already are as far as I'm concerned.)
2,Product has changed and not for the better.,"This particular razor has been a staple in our household for years. It gives absolutely the closest shave possible without tearing up anybody's skin. About a year and a half ago I started having trouble finding this razor at all of my local stores, WalMart, CVS, Walgreen's, etc... I found these on line last year and ordered them-I was extremely pleased with the quality and price. This last order was a BIG disappointment. The plastic handle has changed (smaller and more difficult to grip even though the packaging says otherwise), but the blades are not the same. These new Bic Comfort Twins do NOT give a close shave. We are all having to reshave the areas to get a closer shave and then my skin is irritated. Of course by shaving an area twice the blades wear out faster hence more sales? I will probably try one more order from another source to see if I can find the ""old"" razors and if not I'll buy another brand locally."
5,bad behavior,"Great Read. I bought it b/c it contains the story on which the movie Secretary is based, but overall I loved the whole book."
3,Not what I was hoping,"I was thinking I was going to be reading an edgy, provocative story. It wasn't. She is a good writer, but the book is a little too internal for me. It wasn't enough grit in my opinion."
2,"Do NOT buy this, because you enjoyed The Secretary Movie","I cannot really evaluate this book on its own merits, because I bought it primarily for its connection to the movie The Secretary. Personally, I did not enjoy any of the short stories much at all, however, I was not really prepared for their bleakness, given the expectations I had from the movie. I suppose it's inevitable that the connection between this book and a successful movie would be exploited, but the themes and premises of the two could not be more at odds. While the movie is a funny, endearing and ultimately normalizing look into a productive BDSM relationship, the short story is a grim and alienating account of sexual harassment, perversion and the destructive nature of sexual compulsion. I think it's audacious that any connection between the two is being emphasized to promote sales."
1,normal people? no!,"Enough with the intellectual high minded reviews. These are short stories about loosers. This book is about the seamier, scummier parts of low life living. Stories about people who enjoy the misery in their lives, who have lousy jobs and refuse to aspire to better themselves, people who cheat and lie and admire themselves for it. Not only that; most of them are physically unattractive to add to the misery. There is nothing pretty or nice in any part of these stories; rooms are dirty and messy, the streets are miserable. why oh why would anyone want to read this? I read 3 stories hoping for some light; none; tried another; I suggest; don't bother."
4,Your Neighbor's Secret Life?,"A collection of short stories about people whose idiosyncracies do not conform to society's view of ""acceptable behavior,"" but who live essentially normal lives and who are for the most part indistinguishable from the man or women next door. As one might expect in a collection of short stories, not each story is of equal merit, but I found only one (Daisy's Valentine) which I would rate subpar. In my subjective view, the other eight ranged from excellent (Trying To Be, Secretary) to good (Something Nice, Other Factors, Heaven,) to above average (Connection, A Roamtic Weekend, An Affair Ended). Secretary was made into the movie of the same name and Heaven seemed more of an outline for a novel than a short story."
3,"Stories of the sexual ""bad behavior"" of those on the fringe.","As the description states, these are ""powerful stories of dislocation, longing and desire"" about characters precariously living on the edge who manifest their discomfiture in sexual ""bad behavior,"" much like Justine Shade in Gaitskill's ""Two Girls, Fat and Thin."""
1,Boring.,Boring. There's nothing more to say but I have to fill up the required word count. This book was barely readable. Don't buy it.
2,NOT THE SAME SCENT,"Nancy Baldwin's review is dead-on right! The new scent is NOT the same. Fortunately, I only ordered two, but it has an ""off"" smell that is not pleasant. I have an old bottle of the original in the dark tan bottle and am able to do a ""smell"" test. Trust me. The new stuff is NOT the same and is not a good fragrance in my opinion. And the difference is not ""minute"" as someone else said in their review. Their smeller must not be very strong. I am searching for the product in the original tan bottle before I will buy some. Otherwise, I will have to do without."
1,"Synthetic, cheap ingredients","I just bought some diffuser and a bag of potpourri. I've been using the original off and on for about 50 years--since Claire Burke was making it herself. I thought the dried stuff in the bag looked odd. It used to be all rose petals, lavender, something with blue petals, cinnamons spices, etc. in very fine pieces. The last time I bought it the pieces were bigger, but it still smelled okay. This new version resembles whole walnuts and hunks of wood soaked in some kind of synthetically produced version of the real scent. There's no way this could be used for making sachets, which is what I wanted. The diffuser smells almost medicinal. I doubt there is anything in the recipe that includes actual plant matter.It's obvious that this is NOT the original Claire Burke recipe. Whoever is manufacturing this stuff should be ashamed to even use the name on the label. Claire must be spinning in her grave."
2,not the same,Since the company was sold to an american company the fragrance does not hold up as well as it used too. Frangrance does not last very long either.
2,Smells Like Cinnamon.,"I don't understand why this products is so expensive and has such rave reviews. The bottle is nice looking and the label is pretty but this just smells like cinnamon. I don't smell roses, lavender or any of that, and it's small so it doesn't last very long."
1,Claire Burke Original Vapourri,"About fifteen years ago, I was introduced to Claire Burke's Home Original Vapourri. The smell was heavenly and it was all I used for years. It has a wonderful scent and kept my house smelling fresh for hours. I hadn't used it for about five years and decided to buy somemore. The one I received smells like the formula had been changed from the original Claire Burke I used before. Needless to say, I will never buy this product again. What a huge disappointment."
4,claire burke originals,"Fine, as chosen. A little smaller than I pictured. Got them on time and well wrapped."
4,Yay OZ!,"I'm totally obsessed with this show... it's a good thing I bought them all together! Although I wish I had waited because now the price is lower. Stick it out, it might drop even more.Oh, and one little complaint. For the hard of hearing, there aren't subtitles in the first 2 (or maybe it's just the first) seasons. If your TV has its own subtitles, then you can use those. I'm not deaf, but I like to catch every little detail so subtitles are important to me.Otherwise, I happy with the purchase!"
2,Not really satisfied.,I bought this for a family member for Christmas. When I received it everything looked good. When i viewed some episodes I noticed there was a split second glitch/ skip every 20 minutes or so. Played it on different DVD players and the same thing occurred. Episodes 7 and 8 on season 3 didn't even play. The inside of one of the boxes were ripped. I think it's safe to say that this product is defective. I hope something can be done because this is a first when dealing with amazon.
3,Oz 4th season,I love the show and enjoyed the 1st 2 discs. The 3rd disc freezes on 2 different episodes. I need to return this for refund; I'm not sure how. Very frustrating.
2,Movies not new as advertised,I ordered the HBO OZ series as new and when I received them they were definitely not new. They had scratches on the disks and while watching them some of them continuously skip. The last disk of season 1 did not play at all. I have had much luck ordering from Amazon but from this merchant I would not order again as I did not want to pay for new disks and get used ones.
2,Not Happy,Well shipping and billing went very well as it always does but I was not overly happy with the product. I have watched all of the oz story on HBO and noted that these ones seem to be way out of order and also seem to be missing some shows. Disk # 2 on I think it was the third season would not play at all for 1/2 of the second and all of the third show and they would not play at all on one of my DVD players. I'm not sure if it is normal but several of the DVD's look like they are copys ie no name's on them no stickers just silver DVD'S Maybe thats why I saw others for more money.
2,oz complete,"I expected this not to be edited so. It was not as raw as the original shows shown weekly when the series was actively running. Loved the story line so, I was not disappointed with that."
3,retract,"I retract my previous statement ,yes season 3 discs did not play at all and if they did playthey were constantly skipping and pausing, and disc #2 for season 5 came in cracked, howeverI contacted the seller and he said he will be happy to send a replacement for the defective ones"
2,Oz season 1 - 6,Programe is fantastic. The DVD box set was made from copied dvds though and I could not access the special features on them. Dvd played fine otherwise.
2,Be careful with children,"I bought this series after seeing a couple of the OZ shows on TV. Then, after these came, I saw a show that featured full male frontal nudity. I was shocked and very turned off to the whole thing. Now I have six boxes of DVDs that I'm going to have to sell myself.The show is intense and there are a lot of different views of what prison life is like, but I really can live without the extra little (?) feature!"
4,Fast but slightly scratched,"I received six seasons of a tv show on DVD in record time. My only complaint is that the quality was listed as ""Like New"" and yet three or four of the episodes were scratched, one so heavily I missed most of the episode. It was clear an effort was made by seller to clean the discs, but they should have listed the quality as ""very good"" instead."
1,5 for fighting,When purchasing the album Message For Albert by five for fighting I didn't realise i would be purchasing a radio promo copy which is illegal to sell. This should not be allowed. I will be contacting the authorities.
2,Five for Fighting,I like this CD less than the other Five for Fighting recordings I have. It doesn't seem to have the harmonies and sing along quality of the others.
5,Save the World? Or Sinanju's Treasure?,"A classic Destroyer novel! This one has all the classic elements fans of this series will love. The unthinkable has happened - the treasure of Sinanju has been stolen! Chiun hurries home to track down and destroy the fiends who would dare such a thing, but Remo refuses to join him. Some trivial nonsense about saving the world.... The interaction between Chiun and Remo is better than ever and even Chiun ends up guessing as to who's behind it all."
5,A splendid peek into the world of the dark!,"From the opening credits to the final credits, Night Warriors is a great series that should go other great anime movies that have been brought over, Street Fighter and Fatal Fury. Vol. 2 has less action then Vol. 1, taking more enphasis to story-line. Everything in this series screams of greatness."
3,Where the hell is Felicia and Jon,"I bought this dvd and it was o.k. But i don't see the need to have every episode focus on Donovan. I hate Donovon. Where the hell were Anakaris, Raptor, Demitri, Morrigan and most importantly Jon and Felicia. They should have focused more on the love between Morrigan and Demitri instead of those bitchy Darkstalker hunting sisters. They should have shown more Raptor, Felicia and Jon instead of having Donavan bitch about his blood. Just kill your self if you hate your self so much. Worse still Sasquatch, Victor, and Anakaris are only shown getting beaten up by Pyron. This is o.k. and great for any fans of the game, but don't focus on the crappiest charecters."
4,Scary eyes,"I give this 4 stars because Felicia scares me with her mean eyes. Hehe, great anime! Oh no I think I'm hooked AAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIEEEEEE (Dubbed is a lot better than subtitled, wheee!)"
3,"Morrigan was hot, but that's about it.","I got the first episode on VHS and I liked it alright. It had most of the characters and was enjoyable. Then I made the mistake of buying the other three. I was very disappointed, they didn't even have Lord Raptor in any later ones and they just kept centering on a really boring story line. The whole thing didn't make much sense at all.I'm sure I'm going to get people voting that this wasn't helpful because they know the backstory of the Darkstalkers and will have figured out the story fast, but as someone going in with a (mostly) blank slate, it was just confusing.I do give it a lot of credit for the fights, because those were GREAT, but I take a lot away because of Donovan droning on and on about his dark blood, everybody saying ""the dark"" at least once in every sentance, and worst of all the final episode and ending."
3,Opera glasses,I was looking for these as opera glasses but when they arrived they were too big to fit easily in a suit pocket. Optically they were fine but I returned them and got a pair of Galileo binocs instead: they are just the right size and are also excellent and sturdy. Unfortunately I do not see them carried by Amazon any more.
4,nice binoculars,"No issues with binoculars fogging up, went from hot truck to cold outside and back all day long with no issues fogging up. Great clarity but field of vision isn't as large as I would hope but still good. Only downside is the lens caps are cheap and individual (not connected together or to the binoculars). Also they don't go on that easy, cannot put lenses covers on when the eye pieces are extended for people without glasses. If you do it pushes them in and probably isn't good for them. I do recommended to anyone for the price and quality. It is also a little heavier than I would like to be carrying around my neck for extended periods."
2,Poor Quality,"I bought two pairs of these binoculars. The first pair never really focused properly and the second pair had it's eyepiece fall off after less than a year of light use. And of course, the warranty is useless since you'd have to pay for shipping."
4,Good price for compact binoculars,Took the binoculars on vacation to Africa. Worked well on safaris and was easy to pack.
3,3DN deserve better than this...,"Of the three Edsel repackages, this combo of ""Cyan"" and ""Hard Labor"" is the least depressing. The audio is lackluster in comparison to MCA's original CD releases of the albums, and while the accompanying booklet is nicely laid out, it does contain several factual errors. Edsel dropped the ball here, folks. Better to keep the MCA discs if you have them, or search those discs out."
1,street finder denver reginal 2002,The format of the street locator in the back of the book changed dramaticaly from the 2001 format 2001 is much easier to follow than the 2002 or 2003 version of the some book.I hope they realise there mistake and go back to the better and easier format
4,Great DVD!,"Very entertaining piece encompassing the career of the Turtles. Compiled with their wonderful music, along with humorous descriptions of the various moments that filled their lives along the way, and eventually found them not so ""Happy Together"" Flo and Eddie are the best comedians.........and musicians.Great viewing!"
3,"""Happy"" I purchased this DVD","This is pretty much exactly what I thought it would be....The music is great, the videos dated, as they would be, and the commentary interesting and sometimes insightful. This package would have been better with more live material but I can only assume that very little live material was available for inclusion.I was curious as to how ""non Turtle"" fans would see this dvd and was amused to hear my daughter remark that the music was pretty good but those guys are incredibly nerdy looking...I couldn't disagree. For the $$$, its a nice addition to your DVD library. Enjoy"
3,Good documentary,"The Turtles were a second rate group with two or three first rate songs but this documentary will please anyone interested in sixties pop music. Never great song writers, they were able to make ""Happy Together"" a monster hit with their soaring harmonies and Howard Kaylan's great leading vocals. Their time in the sun was short, however. Close knit, baroque pop harmonies went out of style after 1968 in favor of a more electric instrumental sound. The Turtles tried to be progressive, made mediocre albums (including one produced by Ray Davies of The Kinks), the hits stopped, and Volman and Kaylan ended up singing for Zappa and T-Rex. What we remember are the hits: ""Happy Together,"" ""Elinor,"" ""She'd rather be with me."" This is an interesting dvd because so little is known about the Turtles. They were friends from the same high school who hit the big time while still quite young. Not a great group but one that has earned a place in sixties pop history."
4,A low key success,"I am not really familiar with The Turtles, I mean I hear their hits on oldies stations regularly, but I never knew the members too well. So I purchased the DVD for 12.99 and it was a good buy. The production values are decent and there's lots of band footage from concerts and television (mostly TV) and the two lead singers (Flo and Eddie?) add a lot of commentary along with others members of the band. Sound quality is excellent, even on the old TV shots, and some of the newer TV shots the sound is even better. ""Elenor"" played on a television show is presented here where the band actually performs the tune instead of lip-syncing the hit (an all too common practice)and give a crackerjack performance, to boot! A good effort for a good solid band that bridged the pop gap from the 60's into the early 70's."
5,Still Happy Together and Funny,"One of the most delightful additions to the stoggy, overly serious collection of rock band autobiographies. The two core members of the band Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman walk you through the groups history. Lots of great music, funny stories and insight into the inner workings of the band. They are joined at points along the way by Jim Pons, John Barbata (one of the best drummers ever...) Chuck Portz and even Spanky McFarland from Spanky and our Gang. I saw this on tape many years ago and was so glad it came out on DVD. It's a must have for any Turtles fan or for any fan of 60's pop music. I only wish more bands had their wit and humor. Well done."
4,Exceeded my expectations,Last year I had purchased a Spectare Keypix and the photo quality was terrible. So I wasn't expecting better quality from this product but I was pleasantly surprised. The picture quality is very good. I will probably purchase more of them.
1,Very disappointing,"It gets one star for the idea....After I purchased 2 keychains for parents, I decided to load pics for them. Good thing. After much difficulty, I searched for this brand online and found people having multiple problems. After reading and researching, I was able to load it on my Mac. I had difficulty opening photo viewer, but not knowing what I did different, finally got it to work. I downloaded photos, tried to transfer them, again problems. I never got the pics onto the keychain, so I returned them. After the hours of trying to figure it out, I will buy a different brand AFTER I search to make sure it doesn't have as many problems."
2,program not found,"I bought one of these just to try it out, before I bought 3 or 4 for gifts. I was going to preload photos, but when I try to open the program, it gives me a ""program not found"". I've tried multiple times unistalling & installing, even tried other peoples ""tricks"" by hooking up the key chain to the USB before opening program... to no avail...am continuing to have the same problems. Any body have any other advice before I return this."
1,Small piece of junk.,"This was my birthday present from my daughter, for me to carry 60 pictures of my grandchildren - well the CD won't install on my PC - so I need a Mac also, like some other reviewer, or I waste time on hold with a company to get the website for Innovage and download another driver that only works for a Mac.How dissappointing and frustrating this has been - hope my daughter can return it. Don't waste your time or money. I do give it one star because it is a cute idea."
1,Innovage Digital Photo Keychain,This thing never did work!!I did everything as directed by instructions.Don't get one!!!
1,Terrible,"I got my money back, but wasted several hours trying to make it work. What a waste!! very cheap piece."
1,Good luck using with Mac,The driver comes on a mini CD which none of my apple computers can load.Their support website no longer seems to exist so I can't download it.You'll be happier with one that mounts as an ordinary USB HDD.
2,Don't bother to buy this,"I bought 2 Innovage Digital PhotoKeychains on sale, one for me, one as a gift. Fortunately I tried mine out before giving the other as a gift. I follwed the instructions to the letter [I'm a little over zealous about that] but it still doesn't work correctly. I fully charged the battery (overnight) but unless it is plugged into the computer via the USB cable it won't turn on. When plugged in, it won't turn off. Once on, it can be removed from the USB cable & will display the photos but if turned off, either automatically or manually, it won't turn on (as stated previously). Unless you plan to use it exclusively near a power source don't waste your money or time. That said, the picture quality for the small size & cheap make of the product is not bad. I also would not use it as a keychain as its durability as such is suspect."
1,Very disappointed.....(0 out of 5 stars),"I purchased 4 because I thought these would make great gifts. I returned 3. (I only kept the 4th becasue the package was opened and I didnt want to pay the restocking fee on a $20 item.) I am very dissatisfied with this product. It came with a tiny cd, which doesnt seem to work on my laptop or macbook. Why wasnt this mentioned in the specs? Maybe I'll get it to work eventually, but I am not going to put much effort into it."
2,cheaply made,"I returned the keychains after waiting a long time to receive them. They appeared to be cheaply made. The viewing screen would be easily scratched in your purse or pocket. Also, they didn't appear to accept SD cards to upload pictures. I didn't open the package but they only appeared to attach to the computer to download pictures."
3,Not best product out there,I found this product at my local Wallgreens on sale for $[...] so i decided to give it a try. As soon as i opened it up i noticed it felt cheap and light. I plugged it into my usb wall charger and it powered up with no problems. I could not get any pictures on it without using its included software. The device has nothing but basic functions but worked fine. The Lcd display did not have much contrast and the buttons clicked loudly but otherwise this product has not disappointed me yet. The slide show animations are nice.I would recomend it to someone who dosent need lots of features but needs a basic photo viewer.
4,PROBLEM WITH TURNING IT ON,"RECEIVED AS XMAS GIFT, EVERYTHING WORKED FINE FOR INSTALLING SOFTWARE AND PICTURES, BUT AFTER PICTURES WERE INSTALLED,I CAN'T GET IT TO TURN ON WHEN NOT CONNECTED TO THE COMPUTER. HAVE TRIED THE RESET BUTTON AND LEFT IT PLUGGED INTO THE COMPUTER FOR 7 HOURS A COUPLE OF TIMES. HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS PROBLEM AND IF YOU HAVE IS THERE ANY SOLUTION TO MAKE THE KEYCHAIN WORK."
1,huge waste of money,"I purchased 4 of these as gifts. The first one I opened didn't work at all. I opened the second one and charged it - since it seemed to charge okay, I gave it as a gift. The day after Christmas I find that it won't turn on. Same thing with the third one, although I did load photos on it before sending it since it was going out of state, to a Great Grandmother. I doesn't turn on consistently. The fourth was to be loaded with photos and sent to my son overseas, however due to the quality of the others it will be returned, unopened. I also tried for several weeks to contact the service number included, but either the line was busy or a recording stated they were ""experiencing an unusually high number of calls, please try again"" and the call was ended."
3,Personalized Gift Idea,"The Innovage Digital Photo Keychain was a big hit with all of my family members. I gave one to everyone in my family for Christmas. I personalized each one by importing pictures that were special to each one. The software was easy to install but I had to download an updated patch for it to work properly on my Windows Vista desktop. The pictures were easy to import with the user-friendly software. It took about 3 or 4 hours to fully charge the batteries for the unit, but I've had it now for almost a month and have not had to recharge it yet. As a gift idea, many of my family members said it was one of their best gifts because it was so personal. My 75 year old mother especially loves it because she gets to view pictures of her late husband and all of her children wherever she is. It's a great way to share photos with others since it's so compact, easy to use and a fun new technology. Well worth the price for a great little personal and heartfelt device."
3,It Works...,"I received this as a gift from someone, and I was a bit excited since it's something I've always wanted but didn't want to spend extra money on. I think those are the best types of gifts!Anyway, I was unimpressed with the exterior of the product itself. It's plastic, which makes it look and feel kinda cheap. It has that feel to it where you wouldn't be surprised if it stopped working. It's cheaply made.The picture display quality is okay. It's not impressive, but it serves its purpose.But, it works. The software was easy to install, and the pictures were super-easy to load as well. As for using the actual keychain, it's really simple to follow since there are only three buttons!So, I'm glad I didn't buy this for myself, but I still am glad I received it as a gift."
4,Very cute little gadget!,"After reading all of the awful reviews, I expected to have to battle to get any pictures on this little gadget! I received this as a gift for christmas, and just now got a chance to sit down and play with it. I read the instructions and I had no problems at all! The only thing that I fumbled with for a few minutes was that if you hit ""syncronize"" to upload photos to your keychain, you have to close the program and reopen it to get it to be able to add additional photos. I don't know if this is normal for everyone's program, but it's not a big deal at all. Instructions specifically said not to connect the keychain until after downloading drivers and programs (and that doing so can cause permanent damage)... maybe this is what those who can't get their keychains to work did.I'm excited to put it onto my keychain! I just hope it won't get too scratched in my purse..Now I don't need to carry around photos!"
3,"At first, keychain didn't work at all: Reset button issue","Was really worried at first. Plugged this Christmas gift in after downloading software as instructed, and got red charging light but no screen whatsoever. Pressed 'on' for 3 seconds, no change. Re-read instructions, used a fine point pen to push the reset button, no change--still just red charging light, black screen area.Read many of Amazon's reviews, went back to try again. Used a long, heavy needle on the reset button--reset feature is apparently very deep into the keychain, because the needle went almost to the opposite side of the housing. When I plugged the keychain back into the USB port, TA-DA-- BLUE SCREEN with 'charge' and 'upload' options!! 3 stars because it MIGHT work from this point forward. Just thought I'd add some additional info regarding the reset button. The website is P-O-O-R and the little manual that comes with this product isn't alot of help if troubleshooting is needed."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this little keychain viewer on a whim as a gift for my wife but could never get the software to work. I Carefully followed the directions that came with it to load the software on my PC. It installed but I could never get it to run. Therefore, it was impossible to load any pictures on to the keychain. I thought that the software might not be compatible with Vista so I tried it on my older computer with XP. Same thing. I called the Tech Support number and got only an answering machine. It goes back to the store for a refund tomorrow."
1,Really a bad product,"I bought two of them and they work during a few weeks, i lost the pictures, the surprise of the present and the money, my recommendation don't buy it."
2,Lame documentation,"After a lot of searching, it needs to be in update mode not charge mode for the software to work."
1,Waste of time and $,"I bought one to send to my brother who is serving in Iraq so he could have a portable photo album of his grandkids. The first one I bought would not load the software. In fact it seems like my computer began having speed and crashing problems after I tried the process. I returned the device and used my laptop to run the software on the second one. Although I charged the device for 7 hours as directed, (it already had the green light when it was first hooked up)and had no problem loading pictures this time, it will not work when disconnected from the computer. The power button does not turn anything off when it is connected, and will not turn anything on when not connected. Since the button works for changing screens when hooked up, I don't think it is the button, I think it has no battery! It shows pictures when hooked up but unfortunately is going to the garbage because it will not serve the purpose. As someone else said, I can't have a computer dangling from the keychain!"
1,Product is bogus,I've been trying for two days to get the software to recognize the device and it just ain't working. I'm a computer professional; if I can't get this to work you have no chance!
3,"Good idea, cheap product","I got this keychain for myself since I wanted to carry my baby pictures with me and show them off to friends and family. the price was ok, the product is very cheap. Have patience with the software and the key thing for me to have the picture download go smoothly is that I sorted the pictures I wanted to load in a new folder on my PC and then reduced their MB size to around 500KB that worked like a charm. If they could make this same system with better quality parts it would be awesome. I have had this keychain for a week and its working lets wait and see..."
1,Mac support is bogus,"This item was purchased because they advertised Mac support. The claim is completely bogus. First of all, the CD that comes with the product is a Mini CD which is something that a mac cannot load, and yet the instruction manual wants you to jam this into your slot loading drive. When you go to their web site to download the software, the software only comes as an outdated stuffit archive (something that modern mac users very seldom use) and after going through the trouble of finding the software to extract this archive I only then find out that it is missing the install software. Only the Uninstall software is present. VERY stupid. Needless to say, this product is 100% useless to me."
2,Not for OS X 10.5,"I bought two of these at Walgreens for $10 each. I planned on loading them up with photos from my Mac before gifting them to a friend who uses them in her art.Luckily I had my work Dell laptop, because they will not work on my Mac Mini.-The CD is a mini cd, and will not work with a slot loading mac. I used an external DVD\CD to install the software.-The included software will install on 10.5, but will not work on OS X 10.5 You will get a message that says device not found.- On windows Vista, they work fine.These are fine if you are using a windows machine, but they will not work on a Mac, and they are advertising that they will"
3,Difficult to figure out with XP!,"I received the keychain as a gift . After I installed it, it gave me a program error. Here are some hints to make it work. Don't open the program until you have the keychain charged. Then set time etc. THEN open the program and as long as it is hooked up to your computer the program will run and you can then add your pictures. Save the pics and then synchronize.It is too flimsy to be an everyday keychain.Hope this helps!"
5,"""I need to be a hero.""","As this wonderful movie opens, we enter the world of Eve's Bayou, the Louisiana home of ten-year old Eve (Jurnee Smollett) and her charming, philandering father Louis (Samuel L. Jackson), her glamorous and superstitious mother, her psychic aunt (Debbi Turner), and her big sister who idolizes Daddy as much as Eve does. The narrator's opening line concerns a murder, and we wait for this terrible event to occur.I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It drew me in and held me spellbound, with it's believable story and likeable characters. We really get to know and care about Eve's family and all their secrets. The actors are uniformly excellent, especially the young star, Jurnee Smollett. The director succeeds by constantly reminding us of the picturesque bayou setting and its unique community. As the story got closer and closer to the inevitable tragedy, I was almost holding my breath. It's an intense story about real, multi-layered people. Highly recommended."
5,One of the best!,This is a beautiful film! The cinematography is just plain awesome. It is a great story and has a great cast. A must have for serious collectors of great African American Movies.
5,amazing,This is such a great movie. The actors are great and the story so original. It's more than it seems. It's the kind of movie I like to revisit over and over.
5,Love this movie!,Eve's Bayou is one of my all time favorite movies. The entire cast is excellent! This is a must see.
3,"Captivating story, mood-setting scenery and photography","Eve's Bayou is a wonderful, dark movie. And the soundtrack is even better. The actress who plays the youngest daughter gives a strong, likeable performance."
2,Eve's Bayou,Started out well...then kerpluck... it drop..like a hot stact of butter... There were some scenes that were not really fully explained... and it just dragged on and on... with no explaination... PASS!
2,A healing mechanism? . . .,"After owning this film for two+ years, I can safely say it's a keeper even with my 2-star rating. Eve's Bayou reveals a historical narrative that many families can relate to, but few often confront it. The film could be used as an educational tool towards deconstructing the 'silencing of the feminine voice.' If you're curious. . .have a look."
2,More Dis-unity,"Another tired story about the Blackman as the horrible villian and the Blackwoman as the innocent victim...And we wonder why our community has so many problems..Maybe it's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films...""Color Purple"" , ""For Colored Girls...."" etc. We need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we ""work together""...That means Blackmen and Blackwomen..."
1,Melodrama at its worst,This movie tries way too hard to the point that it becomes a painful melodrama filled with gratuitous dialogue and over-acting. I found this movie to be thoroughly unsatisfying.
4,Eve's Bayou,"I've always liked this movie as a kid and told myself that I would get it on DVD and finally came around to getting it. The movie itself is really good, Im not sure what to say without feeling living Im giving something away, so to say the least check out a preview on youtube and if you are reeled in by what you see and have never seen this film then you should order it. The the price is beyond reasonable so you wont regret it."
5,EVES BAYOU,"This is a wonderful story set in beautiful New Orleans, that showcases young Jurnee Smollett and a host of other seasoned actors . The story is at times funny and heartbreaking tale about a young girl who discovers her father is just a man with faults and vices like any other man. Played by Sam Jackson Her Dr. father is having multiple affairs with his female patients. After her older sister accuses him of molesting her, The youngest daughter seeks help from the local voodoo practitioner(PLayed by the wonderful Diahnne Carroll) to get revenge for what she believes is the ultimate betrayal. There is also an aunt who is clarivoyant who seems to be doomed to lose her husbands in violent ways. I wont tell any more of the story except to say that once you have seen it you will watch it over and over again its a classic ."
3,Beware - interesting read but homosexual subplot is offensive,"I found this book interesting and I liked the use of letters and diary entries as the way to tell the story. What I didn't like, and didn't see mentioned in any reviews, is the offensive homosexual references and sex scenes. If books had a rating this would be an ""R"". The sad part is it wasn't needed. I would skip this book and wish I had..."
3,Boring,"I wanted to read a book just like the Vinchi Code. Boy, was I disappionted! It is boring, slow and the prose leaves you with lot to be desired. The rave reviews from all other magazines is just not telling the truth!!!"
2,Dessicated and forgettable,"I picked up this book because it was billed as a witty, involving and layered mystery. It was well written, and the plot was not terrible. However, I did not empathize or care for the characters in this novel at all and therefore did not really care what happened.I did not think the mystery was very mysterious or puzzling. It's possible that I may have missed some salient points and in-jokes, but I really don't care - this is no layered Gene Wolfe novel, but rather a ho-hum forgettable book that I probably will never think about again after submitting this review."
2,Once again-beautiful execution but lacks stamina!,"&#65279;I had hoped after reading Prague that all this brilliant writer needed was more experience to learnplot development to measure up to the quality of his writing. Disappointingly, the experience of the Egyptologist waseven more unsatisfying than Prague. This writer loses steam about three quartersof the way through, and the endless meandering of the protagonist becomestiresome. Unfortunate because the writing and the topics in both cases get the book to the brink of excellence then they miss the mark. I mightread the next one-perhaps a rigorous editor is what this promising writer needs!"
1,Gimmicks Gone Phar-o-way,"I was looking forward to this book bcause I thought it would be entertaining as well as a learning experience. I just could not get past the gimmicks or the giddiness. I tried reading it a couple different times. This writing style might work for some, but it did not for me. If you want a book with a story as well as an opportunity to learn, then I would recommend two current books-""Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell"" and ""The Falls"". I honestly believe Phillips has much to tell. I would love to see him write a regular old book with a great story, and then experiment as he masters his craft."
3,"I couldn't put it down, alas/fortunately","I will not go into the plot since everyone else seems to have already. I also think the author assumed we'd figure out early on what some reviewers think was supposed to be a surprise. My primary concern with the book is that both primary narrators are obsessive-compulsives and are by their very natures loquacious (to put it mildly). To have edited them down would have gone against their basic characters; to leave it all in (as the author has) does get tedious. It spite of the fact that I found the middle third somewhat rough going, the last third fully redeemed the rest. Ralph's description of the tomb works on several levels and I found that by the end I had some sympathy for him. Given all that, I can only give it three stars but I would still recommend it."
3,"Marvelous voices, interesting tale, some flaws.","Different, engaging and fun ... but somewhere in the middle I lost interest but keep reading and found the groove again. Sassy, snarky, the attitude may put off some but I quite liked it. Many shifts and shudders of a good kind. Oscar Wilde would have been entertained, maybe flattered, by one of the tropes therein. Perhaps a bit too long. The voices are marvelous."
3,interesting way to tell a VERY disturbing story,"I had high hopes for this book and it starts out well. The story is told from several perspectives via letters and journal entries written at different times throughout the timeline of the book. What a great idea!I got my first inkling that something wasn't quite write about a third of the way through the book. However, I was involved with the characters and wanted to see how things worked out. The ending was upsetting on many levels, the most disturbing of which was seeing the total mental collapse of the protagonist from the inside, as well as from the outside, as described by observers...If this type of story is interesting to you, then I think you'll enjoy, as it is very well done and compelling. However, I was expecting more of a murder mystery than an in depth analysis of one man's descent into madness."
4,the best of the Mid East,"An intriguing novel in an old tradition, that with letters from a myriad of characters falls into place rather obliquely. The reader is left to think and rethink, depending on the letter writer. A super escape into old days of exploration with the Americans and the British and taking ""home"" antiquities found in the country of origin of ancient Egypt. It leaves the reader with some unanswered questions, which is , after all , all in the fun---fun? This is about murder. I recommend it to adventurous souls and patient mystery fans,and also to those curious about the philosophy of posession of antiquities."
2,Read something else,"Arthur Phillips created an awesome plot for his novel, but trying to read it at times was like pulling teeth. Normally once I pick a book up I can't bring myself to put it down... this book however, i couldn't bring myself to keep reading even whe i was bedridden for three days with nothing else to do.The theory behind this plot was amazing, but the story-line was way too convoluted, and the huge twist was entirely too predictable. I physically reading a book and flipping back and forth between chapters, but the only way I could finish this novel was by listening to the audio book."
2,Flumoxed,"I consider myself pretty good at figuring out endings early on...but I finished this book, and I still don't understand what happened.I'm totally flumoxed. This has never happened to me, and I'm feeling pretty thick. I must have missed something somewhere along the line! It wasn't so good that I want to read it twice. I loved Prague, but this really confused me."
3,"Dense, but fascinating narrator","Interesting narrative approach, fascinating historical setting... often becomes too dense though. Though I didn't love it, the unreliable narrator(s) kept drawing me back in."
2,Boring and Predictable,"I had high hopes for this book when I first heard about it. The topic of Egypt is always an engaging one if it's well-executed. Sadly, in this instance, it is not. There is a lot of promise in the way several different stories and voices are intertwined throughout the text, but ultimately the execution falls short. The result is a series of delusional narratives which seem to have a humorous aim, but they end up being kind of sad. The ""surprises"" in the plot were easy to predict, as well."
4,Misunderstood,"I agree with reviewers who say the primary narrator of the novel has a ponderous, overbearing style which makes the early part of the book tiresome and a bit hard to get through. Certainly, it fits the character, though. The ""twist"" at the end, is by no means a stunner, and it certainly wasn't meant to be. Rather, Marlowe enters as a narrator in the end to offer yet another slanted perspective on events. This is a very fine book--well worth reading."
2,Very frustrating,"There are bits of true insight in this book, particularly in how Phillips understands how issues of wealth and class twist people in ways that are not global but distinctive to their personality. And the end is horrifying.But the middle 200-250 pages of this book are completely insufferable. I had to force myself to read it, and it took me nearly two months of fits and starts to do so.It's a shame. Phillips needs to show some respect for his readers and drop his urge for Shyamalan style shenanigans. It's just cheesy and tedious, a problem his occasionally skillful prose can't cover for long."
1,The Egyptologist,"I'm sorry to disappoint any potential reader or offend the writer, but the plot is poorly thought out and the attempt at flashbacks, to present day, to the in-between, have a confusing effect on the reader. The story became very predictable early on, and all the long winded attempts at establishing the characters simply failed, save for 1 or 2 characters. About half-way through, the book became engrossing, but then the author sends us on another flashback and all goes awry. I only read the entire book because I purchased it, and I didn't want to waste my money. With the hype I read in some reviews, and my utter amazement with all things Egyptian, I thought the book would be more appealing to me. In my opinion, save your money and borrow the book from your local library. You'll be happy you did!"
2,Drab and irritating.,"Having read a favorable review of Phillips' second novel earlier in the year, I placed a hold on the book at my local library since it appeared to be in great demand.However, having just finished it, I was pretty disappointed.- It IS overrated.- I figured out the ""mystery"" 40 pages into the book.- I loathed every single character.- The novel is written in letter/journal style.Nothing quite wrong with the last bit on the list, but I've never much cared for novels written in letter form (even Stephen King's novella version of Jerusalem's Lot or Stoker's Dracula didn't quite suit my reading style).Now, were these things Mr. Phillips intention, he has succeeded. But I struggled to finish the book, growing bored and restless (and quite irritated with the stupid characters). Of course, most of his characters weren't really meant to be likeable (I think), but overall this was somewhat of a waste of time."
1,Tedious and predictable,Ingenious premise and narrative devices but becomes insufferably tedious and way too precious after first 80-90 pages. Have to plod through the next 200 or so pages to arrive at an ending that you already have figured out.Really had to force myself to speed read through to the end. I don't think I'll bother reading Prague or Angelika.
1,"obvious plot, arrogant characters","The supposed plot ""twist"" is obvious from very early in the book. There are no emphatic charaters and the main character (who mostly tells the story via his journals and letters) is so unlikable that I didn't really care what happened to him. It was a chore to finish reading."
1,Skip this and move on,"Had it figured out on page 40. Worse, the book is unengaging, and the switching from point-of-view to point-of-view seems contrived and tedious. Nancy Pearl, famous librarian at the Seattle Public Library says she gives a book 50 pages to engage her, and if it does not she moves on. I should have moved on."
4,"Challenging, riveting, but.....","I read two books at a time. I think it is adult ADD, so I have finished few. My problem not yours. But this book had an eerie hook.I am not one to figure out twists before they happened, but as others have noted, it was obvious 40 pages in what the twist would be. A genius like Arthur Phillips must have known it was obvious as well.The narative style was brilliant, and the different narrators support, contrast, but at least rehash the complicated stoty to ensure you are getting it.But the ending, not the very very ending which is haunting, but the part where what you already knew was the twist is revealed- I was lost there. Someone clue me in."
4,Predictable but engaging...,"I was really looking forward to this book, and overall it was worth it. I must admit as other reviewers have that the twist was pretty obvious-I think I figured it out somewhere in the first 30 pages (maybe sooner). But the characters and atmosphere kept me interested (I like books based on egyption lore). A few of the characters showed promise but ended up amounting to nothing (Trilipush's fiance), as if the author wasn't sure what to do with them. I'd still recommend this book-though I enjoyed Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrel far more."
4,"Complicated, nuanced, thought-provoking","Clearly certain reviews (People magazine, I'm looking at you) did this book a massive disservice. Michael Crighton, this is not. But if you enjoy Margaret Atwoodian layers of narrative and reversals and reveals, I do recommend ""The Egyptologist."" Like all such books, it might would be stronger for a unifying afterward, but then, that would very likely undercut the final, pathetic note of the story.I will also say, I think The New Yorker is off their collective nut if they think Prof. Trilipush's biggest problem is mental illness. Just the contrary, the problem is not his grasp on reality, but rather that he has been sold a bill of goods, and is unwittingly attempting (with v. little malice, as far as I can tell) to build his life on a lie."
1,Tedious,"I have not read Prague, and perhaps I should because I disliked the Egyptologist as much as the previous reviewer disliked Prague. The Egyptologist actually begins with an intriguing premise; the two diarists with histories that converge has potential. Unfortunately, the author drags out the story as Trilipush descends into complete insanity. The ""surprise"" ending is obvious about a third of the way through the book, but I couldn't believe it could be that transparent and trudged through to the end just because I was convinced there had to be something else. But no. I can't believe this book would have been published if not for the success of Prague. I'm reasonably certain the author had to be high to continue ad infinitum in his tedious vein with little variation in pace or plot."
1,Boring!,I had a very hard time getting through this book. The author spent way to much time on certain particular subjects to the point of boredom. Do not read this book.
1,SIMPLY BORING,"The story was inarticulate and slow. The subject could be made into a very interesting and exciting story, however this book is not the case. In the end I sat there feeling unfulfilled and wondering what the heck was going on. I'm still not certain I understand how it ended up. There were a lot of loose ends. I would definitely not recommned this overrated pile of garbage."
1,annoying,"The idea was intriguing. A bit slow but semi-interesting for the first 350 pages. Then the author, through character narrative, offers 4 or 5 ending scenarios. Then takes them all back. Then offers a very annoying and vague ending through 'letters' from very distant characters. I was so annoyed and dissatisfied by this book. I'd recommend it only to people I didn't like. I totally agree with the reviewer who said this book was published only because the author produced Prague. To the author I'd say: Look it's all fiction. Don't tease the reader with 5 fake endings and then offer the 'real' ending. All fake endings are real endings in fiction. You spoiled the finale completely."
1,Snooze,I couldn't even finish this bore fest. And I almost never walk away from a bad movie or novel. Don't waste your money.
4,A wonderful tale for anyone who likes all things egyptian.,This is a very entertaining read. I loved all the folklore about the great digs of the 1920's. I highly recommend this book. I will pick up Prague after reading this book.
1,Long and tired,"A complete bore-fest from start to finish, too long by a hundred pages, and very tiresome after fifty. This was a top pick by Stephen King in Entertainment Weekly but do yourself a favor and pass on it."
2,Rather tedious and laborious overall...,"I agree with another reviewer who found this a ho-hum experience. I'm pretty forgiving as a rule, and will usually go all the way through a book out of a sense of respect and to keep an open mind, but found this to be a very trying experience in this book. This was perhaps made worse by the obvious nature of the ""mystery"" before I was even half way through. And the ""official"" unveiling of the mystery toward the end seems to take a very very long time.I couldn't get engaged in the story, and was aware that the nature of the events surrounding the letters and diary entries made the content/character/motivation less believable, e.g. a character might be ""on the move"" a lot and yet taking time to write lengthy notations that wouldn't fit the circumstances.I did find this same attention to detail very interesting at some points, but it failed to carry the story sufficiently for me."
2,Tedious,"disappointing ending, and an overall tedious pace to the story left me wanting more from this book. I wouldn't recommend this book to a friend, and i regret the time spent reading it. boo hoo."
3,Mystifying but not a mystery,"I am a bit mystified by the people who found this a challenging read. I thought it flowed pretty well and was engaging for the first half, until it became clear that I had figured out the big ""twist"" well before the books too-cool-for-school author seemingly intended. Ok, fine, maybe it's not supposed to be a mystery. But the big unveiling of the truth in the end is staged as if we are supposed to find it a big shock.The good: excellent use of several unreliable narrators, and some clever humor. Trilipush's journal entries and writings leading up to the end are simultaneously amusing and horrifying.The bad: author too enamored with how clever he thinks he is. Once it becomes clear that the big central mystery is all there is to this book, it becomes tedious."
1,A Desert Trek without H2o would be more interesting,"Reader beware, the average rating of this book is currently three and half stars. It's a love it or hate it book. Personally, I thought it a terrible waste of time, depressing, and unfulfilling, but I got hooked on some level. The first third was fun and interesting, however as it pushes on (and that's how it feels) it becomes extremely tedious. As one reviewer put it, reading onward becomes a masochistic experience."
2,"And the twist is ... not really a twist, actually.","The big twist becomes obvious to the reader much sooner than half-way through the book. Less than a quarter, if I'm not mistaken. That isn't the problem. The problem is, the reader is the only one let in on the joke, and so for the next three-quarters of the novel, one watches the various characters sparking off one another trying to figure out what is -- to the reader -- obvious ... and failing. Perhaps this all illustrates the thematic point that the author was trying to make, but I'm unable to convince myself that he didn't do it just so he could snicker at the idiotic products of his imagination.In response to another reviewer, who claims that the central protagonist's one saving grace is that he really does love his fiancee, I roll my eyes. It's quite clear that he doesn't, but that he's desperate for someone, anyone, to love him, and that his billets-douxes are written to the end of making sure that she stays hopelessly in love with him."
1,Confusing Narrative,"This book, tries to tell a narrative with an arrogant set of characters that don't blend well from one change to the next. You spend the first half trying to figure out one redeeming quality about the main author and the point of the letters to one's love who seems to hate him, and then if you can make it to the end you are absolutely dissapointed. I actually through the book down in disgust several times and only made myself pick it up because I've never not finished a book."
3,"Clever, but not clever enough","Like some of the other reviewers here, I found the central mystery a bit obvious. Phillips is a talented and witty writer, but I can't escape the feeling that this novel, clever as it is, is missing something."
3,"Worst ending since ""The Sopranos""",The audio book held me captive until the end then I wanted to toss my IPod out the car window. Are you kidding me? If I am expected to come up with my own ending I'll write my own book next time. What a let down. So many great characters and such a fun involving mystery to try to unravel and then ... nothing. It just ends.Phooey!
4,Unrelible narrators,"I enjoyed this a ton, and my enjoyment was helped by the comparison to Possession, an all-time favorite, and by the foreknowledge that our narrators were unreliable, to say the least.I had read Prague a few years ago--an unreliable title!"
3,The Egyptologist,"I read this after When We Were Gods was I was craving for more on Egypt. The book is written as a series of letters between the principal characters. It is often confusing and disjointed. Some of the details concerning the British excavations in the Egyptian desert were interesting. But, the book left me wanting for a more conventional finale and with a lot of unanswered questions."
1,Can I get those hours of my life back?,"So I don't like writing negative reviews, but this book was a disappointment. As someone who minored in Egyptology and is usually a sucker for all things Ancient Egypt, I figured liking this book would be a no-brainer. It started out interestingly enough; dashing brit convinces boston family to back his expedition to find the next Tut's tomb. Unfortunately the tale gets bogged down by a plot that moves at a snail's pace and is very predictable. The real history of excavations and plundering in Egypt from 1800- 1920s is fascinating and full of eccentric characters and lucky strikes. So my advice is to find a biography of Howard Carter or Belzoni and skip The Egyptologist."
2,Not as good as his first novel,"I was looking forward to reading this book, having enjoyed Aurthur Phillips first novel, Prague. Too bad this was disappointed me.Many passages are much too long, which makes the book feel unending. worse is that the book takes the form of a detective novel, but the pieces fall into place much too soon, which compounds the feeling that it is overlong. Worst is that the characters are badly developed and unlikeable.There are, however, a few things to like in this book, Arthur Philips has interesting ideas and a sense of humor, but I cannot recommend reading the entire novel for a handful of worthwhile scenes."
1,Wish on one star!,"This book is just a load of [bull]...I did manage to read more that two chapters and I did manage to smile a time or two. However, I must say poor Thomas Jefferson to be so ill used, not to mention quotes that served a better purpose when orginally read.Unless you have more money and time than you know what to do with, don't waste any of it. Thank God I was able to borrow a copy."
3,Lounge Singers,I was expecting more than I got here. I wanted some bluesy jazzy hip kinda music in a smoky dimly lit lounge and I got radio music.
5,Good Product,"Bonide Turbo Spreader Sticker is compatible with almost every herbicide, insecticide, and so on, but always check the product label of the chemicals you're using to determine the amounts.This seems to increase rainproofing of sprays as well, holding them better through a light shower."
4,Good soundtrack for a ok movie.,"I saw this movie when I was younger and I have always liked the music in it. The combinations of Rock, Folk, and 80's synthesizer give this score and edgy and exciting sound. The music fits the action on screen and carries the emotion of the events very well. Even if you are not familier with the move, but are into movie scores with more rock and less orchestral feel then you will likely enjoy this soundtrack."
4,Good Quality / Good Price,I bought these over a year ago and they seem to be holding up just as long as higher priced abrasives. It appears to be a great bargain.
2,Better translations available,"My two-star evaluation applies to the translation, which I found difficult to read, at times even incomprehensible. The goal in this edition is a literal ""scholarly"" translation. But those who really wish to weigh Tocqueville's exact choice of words will probably want to read the book in the original French. The introduction is very good.Tocqueville himself is still well worth reading today, although many of the early chapters can be skimmed. It is justifiably considered a classic."
2,Not the same edition I ordered,"I received a different copy of the book, for which I probably paid more money. I got a small paperback version rather than the one shown."
1,Kindle edition lacks live chapter heads,"I won't review ""Democracy in America"" - it's important, so read it!I will mention the Kindle conversion though. This ""MobileReference"" edition has the usual ""live"" table of contents, which will jump to the many chapter heads. But it lacks live links from heading to heading.In any book, particularly a reference book of this type, the ability to skip from chapter heading to chapter heading using the Kindle 5-way control is a very useful feature. Further, it is easy to implement during the conversion process. So WHY isn't that feature implemented? I'm sure it's simple LAZINESS on the part of MobileReference - it might take a programmer a few minutes. I realize the book is public domain and they're not making much on it, but hey, c'mon, guys; do the job RIGHT! Implement this! In ALL your books. In fact, implement it and re-upload them."
4,Insightful,"This book provides wonderful insights on our American political philosophy. He aptly points out the utilitarian approach we have to things. For instance, he recognizes that on the whole, Americans shun anything that is not immediately applicable. This is a great strength and a great weakness, for we do not as easily go off on blind tangents, but we also miss a great many oppertunities to improve ourselves. He also points out out ""tyranny of the majority."" Simply put, if the majority believes something, they are capable of enforcing it by any means necassary, and often will. We have often harmed people's civil rights with such practices. Overall, I think he analyzes us fairly accurately."
2,Get the Library of America Edition,"This 170-year-old book by a young French aristocrat remains one of the most frequently quoted analyses of what Toqueville famously calls America's ""habits of the heart.""If you're interested in reading Toqueville for yourself and not through the eyes of some commentator, what version should you get?Instead of this one, I recommend the Library of America editionTocqueville: Democracy in America (Library of America). First, the translation by Arthur Goldhammer is smoother and more comprehensible, without informality or paraphrase. Second, the Goldhammer translation is not burdened by political leanings or excessively scholarly apparatus. Third--and not unimportant--the Library of America volume is smaller and easier to hold and provides a more pleasant reading experience."
2,abridgement should not equate inquisition,As a former reviewer has stated this edition takes quite a bit of liberty in excising the less flattering aspects of Tocqueville's views of America. In fact the entire section on race-relations has been excised --perhaps it was deemed too controversial? This kind of editing is even more unacceptable in our age of open communications and hopefully open minds. Find another edition.
2,Very dry for the interest subject,"The book was edited in 1994 and does not reflect the latest changes in the law, especially European one (including Eastern Europe). In addition it is very dry. The best part of the book is the history of law development and description of judicial system in France, Germany and England. But thats it! Only West European law is reviewed; nothing about Islamic law, law of African countries (I would like to have brief description at least); the description of Russian law is laughable,no insight.Bottom line, if you have a choice DO NOT buy it or buy a used one..."
3,Good value but lacking in the looks department,"Maybe this headset is a good value, i.e. inexpensive, but it's ugly. The black strip of cheap-looking plastic protects the bearings and saves weight, I suppose, but if I were getting an inexpensive headset (for a vintage road bike especially), I would get a much more attractive Tange Levin. The dull silver on the Ritchey will not match any chrome bits and just looks cheap in general. Plus the logo was printed poorly, but luckily came off the metal cup pretty easily with steel wool, although would not budge from the plastic.I cannot attest to its performance(but I assume it's fine) because after looking at it I did not install it."
3,No subtitles or separate language tracks,"Beware this has the original Mongolian language but it is overlayed with a Russian translation - not a separate language track but Russian on top of Mongolian. There is no ability to select separate language tracks. There are no subtitles; I had hoped for English. I believe the DVD is a Russian product. At the beginning there are an endless number of trailers for Russian movies and you cannot fast forward, skip, or go to main menu."
4,"A little slow paced, but highly entertaining.","An excellent movie. A little slow paced, but highly entertaining. It differed at times from other historical accounts I've read of Genghis Khan; but I thouroughly enjoyed the presentation of the Mongolian actors, language, scenery, culture, and traditions."
4,"Great film, but no free digital copy","I just watched this film with my wife last night. Great visuals, nice acting, and a story that's based largely on a respected history of Genghis Khan. My only complaint is with with the ""digital copy"". Upon opening the case, I went to the web site. An extra $1.99 is required to download the digital copy, which isn't meant for I Pods. Also, if you live overseas, you can't download the digital copy at all."
4,action on blu ray,"surprisingly, this was a very good movie.I had never heard of it until I was surfing through a list of blu ray movies and came upon it. I decided to see a trailer to see what it was about and afterwards gave the movie a chance. I'm not a big fan of subtitle movies but watching this movie was worth it. Yes it is packed with action,fighting, blood and death but it is also about one man who never quits no matter how many times he is beaten down by everything around him. He still forgives and does what he has to for the respect, honor and loyalty of his people and his one true love."
5,classroom hit!,"I knew when my 10th graders saw subtitles on the screen there would be a collective groan but they quickly got into this movie and soon didn't really notice the subtitles. They were very engrossed in the storyline and when the film was over, immediately launched into rave reviews and discussion points about the person behind the legend. ""Mongol"" was an outstanding vehicle for helping my students--a tough audience to engage--to see this historical character as as a real person. We are all anxiously awaiting release of part two!"
5,"Mongol - Best ""foreign"" film of the decade","Dramatically photographed, well directed ... Historical myth supposedly based on Genghis Khan's own biography. Captured, tortured, imprisoned three times, twice by his enemies and once by his blood brother ... helped to escape by his friends and his wife ... a truly fantastic story. I can't wait for volume two."
4,Genghis Khan,This was a really good movie depiction of the life of Genghis Khan. The story starts with him as a little boy and goes on to tell the story of how he became the leader of his group of Mongols and why he was so hardened by the things he suffered through in his lifetime.
3,Essentially a drama + Some good fighting scenes + Defying logic + Some good acting = Worth watching once,"It's essentially a drama. It has some good and violent fighting scenes. Many scenes have been dramatized so much that they're illogical. So, do not expect this film to be true to history. The determination of the main character fascinates me. The acting of the main actor is engaging. It's worth watching."
3,disjointed film fictionalizes Genghis Khan's life,"This film is far too much constructed as entertainment tobe taken seriously if you've read any biography ofGenghis Khan.At times the films gets downright silly, plotwise but itis ravishingly photographed with exotic grandeur.Probably the film had money problems and took a longtime to shoot, but the transient cast makes itdifficult to follow. Since the film is subtitled it'sa little tough for me to say whether the dialog isgood or not, but from a narrative continuity pointof view the film is messy. I know for some viewersa comprehensible story isn't too important, and I'vewatched enough Asian-made films to understand thatcultural differences may account for some of the""huh?"" moments in the film... to some people thisfilm's storyline may make perfect sense, but I foundit uneven and confusing."
5,History Lesson?,"This movie had quite a few true facts about Ghengis Khan in it, it was condensed some and like most stories about these famous conquerers child hood there were some liberties taken in telling the story. For the most part the movie made you feel like you were really there, it was definately authentic. One thing that I noticed right off, was that the actors were actually native, not whites pretending to be asian.Also it was nice that there wasn't as much dialogue since it only comes in subtitles. Those who love history, and war films would find this to be a real treat."
1,Digital copy doesn't work!,"Bought this dual copy (Blu-Ray and Digital Copy) because I am thinking about buying a Blu-Ray player but wanted to see the movie right away on my PC. Well, the Digital Copy has many bugs and won't just work. I hope to be able to see this movie one day!"
5,An artistic achievement,"Beautifully crafted, this movie is a master piece of cinematography. The story exquisitely told, the stage perfectly set, and the parts played so convincingly that I feel like I witnessed history in the making. In the end you will love and cheer for Genghis Khan!"
2,Its a Chinese film with English Subtitles,Don't get confused with the title and description .. it's a Chinese movie with English sub titles. Also I felt the movie was not even close to as beautiful as it claimed to be.
3,How did he do it?,"This movie seemed to focus more on the obstacles Genghis encountered and hardly covered his rise to power. If I had know that, I probably would not have bought the movie. For those more interested in his life before coming to power, this is a good movie."
4,Revenge Can Be Sweet,"Liked the movie, a little slow at some points, but other than that, good if this is your type of movie."
4,"A well-made, entertaining film","Sergei Bodrov's ""Mongol"" (the first film in a trilogy) is a very good film, with fine battle scenes, numerous feuds among clans, some yurts, and fabulous cinematography of the Mongolian and Kazakh landscapes. Throw in a wonderful musical score and some romance, and the result is a well-made, entertaining film.The acting is excellent, with Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano playing Temudgin (who later becomes Genghis Khan) and Mongolian actress Khulan Chuluun playing Borte, his wife."
3,Alyssa or Britney?,"Alyssa Milano has sugary up beat lyrics and a surprisingly good voice. If you like cheesy 90's pop you just gotta buy this album, it fits right between Britney Spears and Christina Agularia, My favorite song is ""What a feeling...I'm hooked on you"" it is so poppy you just can't help dancing around your room and this CD is perfect for road trips! C'mon how many people have an Alyssa Milano CD? if you don't buy it for the music buy it for the coolness factor!"
4,Heaven's Burning,"Altogether an unlikely scenario, but great fun to watch anyway. I was in the mood for escapism and romance when I watched this one, and found it to be quite fine. I suppose at one time or another, every married woman wonders about running off for an adventure- we only dream about finding such a passion in the process.This one was primarily a visceral treat- muscles, hints of bondage, ""spunk"" (gotta watch to understand this one), dancing in formal wear- whew! Colin is a man of few words, but who the hell cares? Facial expressions, body movements, tone of voice, the gentle, awkward approach say it all. The accordian playing guy in the electric wheelchair who gets ditched out in the middle of nowhere cracked me up. I liked this one well enough after renting it, to buy it."
2,Disappointing,"While I like almost anything that Russell Crowe is in (if for no other reason than to watch him), I found myself really disappointed this movie. It is by far and away the worst one and a total waste of his talent. This movie could have been quite a bit more interesting if the script wasn't so lame. It seemed to try to go from point A to point C without going through point B. What a disappointment!!!!!!!!"
1,What's all about?,"I sat through this movie wondering why. The plot is bad, the acting is not much better. I would assume Mr. Crowe needed a pay check."
4,Excellent,"While this is not the best of Crowe's work, it is one of the better ones. Casting realism aside (this is after all a movie) the acting was superb and the plot was interesting. If you are interested in catching up on Crowe's pre-crossing work, this is a good place to start."
3,Great love scenes,"This is not the best Russell Crowe movie I've seen, but it's definitely not the worst! A ""Mad Max"" type of movie, but for the women that love Russell Crowe, I thought the love scene was unbelievably hot! I watched it over and over. And the scene at the ball when they are dancing is heart-rending. Worth sitting through the whole movie. Girls, buy it!"
4,undying love or dying love,"situation makes the heart closer need i say more and I did like the finale. we are dying let,s do it together............."
1,Why I didn't care for this movie,"What's the point of all this killing and violence in a movie? It slurs Japanese and Arabs. People are murdered like popping corn, one after another continuously. Last I checked violent injury is pretty unpleasant, yet in this movie it is treated like candy, kill this one then that one pop pop pop. An utterly pointless movie and a waste of film. Next to Caddy Shack 2, this is the stupidest film ever. They talk about karma, but I would hate to have the karma of having made Heaven's Burning."
4,Revenge and a love story combined,"Sadly, I have bought two copies of this movie and have not been able to view the first 20 minutes of either due to DVD glitches, so I assume that Crowe is a hitman (?). But not the usual kind. He has a big heart, reconnects with his dad, falls in love with the young Japanese woman who does not want to be with her husband anymore, and stays with her to the very end. This is a very entertaining story that blends action with romance."
2,really UGLY outfit for a boy!,"I was expecting this cute or at least a decent outfit for probably a girl but instead got this really, I'm sorry to say it but, UGLY, boys outfit with blue pants and this hideous red, blue, white and red checkered print shirt. Someone else may love this outfit but did not; I could see why it was on sale but Amazon doesn't tell you what you will receive, it is supposed to be a ""Surprise"". Guess what, I was Very Surprised!"
4,Impressive! Better than I'd expected.,"I just got this game a few days ago and it's REALLY fun. While it's obviously geared toward a younger crowd, don't let the cute graphics fool you - this game can get *hard*. A huge number of tracks and vehicles that vary greatly (from spaceships to hoverboats to karts), you'll be at this one for a while. A good tide-me over till Tempest 3000 arrives!"
4,Merlin Racing - Magical NUON Karting,"Merlin Racing by Miracle Design is a kart-racing game pure and simple, and while that means it's derivitive, it's also fun. There are enough gameplay modes, the best being adventure, which has tough, boss-characters to race against, and three different kinds of racing, kart, boat and a space hovercraft, the latter being the coolest of the bunch. Graphically, it's a mixed bag. It's basically N64 quality, with brief glimpses that hint at something more. Polygon count is generally low, and texturing isn't what it should be, but there are some cool effects and animated textures. It's a fun game though, and good for the price (something you'll be able to say about every NUON game)."
4,decent game,"decent game, actually my favorite title on nuon. but if buying one for a sealed collection avoid the amazon 'new' copies and buy from a 3rd party on here. Amazon copies are described as 'new' but are fairly beat up with damaged dvd cases and wrapping."
5,"Best album ever, hands down",As much as I like Phil Collins (a lot) those in the know realised that Mike Rutherford was an even greater talent and that Mike and the Mechanics are even better than Genesis! I don't understand how they never won any awards and never top any of the lists of the greatest songs and albums ever made. There must be a conspiracy!
5,GREAT COLLECTION!,"I love this album, but there are only 13 tracks, there is no 14th track as the review below states."
5,An essential read,"This book presented the concept of ""thinking outside the box"" before the phrase was ever coined, and long before permission to think, much less act outside of the expected was a possibility. The joy of this work is that deception and manipulation are utilized for the best of reasons, and for the most noble purpose. Fulfilling in ways that will leave us yearning for such quality writing again."
1,Generic information,"I was hoping for a book on travel, places to camp, campgrounds and things to see. This is a book about how to use a camper, which we know. I need information on Scandinavia and this book, like so many, cover almost everything but that area. There are better books out there."
5,GOD HELP US ALL!!,"If this is based on a true story like the Exorcist - then I am certainly worried. I can't explain the feelings and emotions that ran through my mind as I poured through the pages. If the main character, Keylee, really endured such torture - than my non-belief system in the supernatural has changed. If there are really so called ""Walk-In's"" out there - God help us all."
4,Video now available!,The TV documentary of this book which appeared on The Discovery Channel is now available on video from The Discovery Channel website store. I highly recommend the video (5 stars) before reading this book. David Rohl is very articulate and interesting as he presents his new chronology of Egyptian history.
1,more fun with words and dates,Another marvelous and engaging work of fiction from psuedo-archaeologist David Rohl. The book is a visual feast and exciting to read but pretty pictures are no replacement for careful philology. It is a great exercise in fitting data to the theory. If only careful scholarship were this exiting to read.
5,An incredible find!,"I was wondering why the Egyptian calendar, the Hebrew calendar and the Gregorian calendar differ so much. I knew that the Hebrew Calendar and Gregorian calendar differ because the Gregorian starts with the birth of Jesus (Yeshua). But why would the Egyptian and Hebrew differ so much? An acquaintance suggested this book. And was that person right on the money!! This book helps to calibrate the two calendars and poses some significant information about the Pharoahs mentioned in the Bible. This was like finding the Rosetta Stone! A must have!"
1,"Zombiez, quite possibly the worst movie ever made.","Let's face it, there are alot of bad horror movies out there.. and this is the worst. First off the cover actually looks really good and the discription is misleading. If you ignore the poor flim quality and the shaky scenes you still are over whelmed with horrible hip hop music played over and over and over again. It's like they didn't even try, the special effects are horrible, infact so bad that it makes Godzilla look awsome. I've never see such poor acting, was this a joke? Did they think that this would be funny? This film is not even acceptable for an elementary school student.. I wouldn't reccomend this dvd to line your bird cage.. it's not even that good."
1,Zombiez,"Don't waste your time or money on this movie. Bad from start to finish...I did make it through it. Low-budget, bad script, bad acting and bad effects. If I could I'd rate it zero, I would.I love a large selection of horror films, but this one just fell short on every level. The only thing that was going for Zombiez was the art work on the DVD cover."
1,I've felt more satisified after buying a losing lottery ticket...,"than after watching this movie.No plot, no explanation of what's going on, just a lot of people (they're supposed to be zombies) with absolutely no make up running around with rubber knives and knocking people down and killing them.I can not believe this made it to film.1) What caused the zombies to rise?2) Zombies using knives?3) Zombies don't even look dead---they look like raving idiots.Not one redeeming factor about this movie---not one!I was looking for a movie to rent and saw nothing, settled on this because the cover looked cool and I love real zombie movies (which this is not!)I spent $4 to rent it and would have been better off wadding that $4 up and throwing it on the floor.Do not buy this movie, don't even rent it. If you do rent it, don't bother watching it. It's not even funny, not even stupid funny. I had to give it one star, if I had my choice, I'd have given it zero, it doesn't even deserve to be called a 1 star movie."
1,my eyes are melting,"this movie has to be the worst movie ever made!!!!! I would not even use this dvd as a coaster. I wish we could give negative numbers!! this movie is actually a -5 stars. 1 star is being too generous!!! DO NOT BUY THIS,DO NOT BUY THIS, one more time DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
1,Just plain bad!.,"The acting is bad even for a B movie. The are no surprises or tense moments. Most of the movie concerns following the main character around as she runs away. There is this hilarious part, in a sad stupid kind of way, where she makes a molotov cocktail and the zombiez wait around for her. The real anticipation is to see if this movie can get any worse. My recommendation: if you have anything else to do, watching paint dry comes to mind, do it first."
1,For the sake of GOD ....,"what the hell were the people who made this thinking, wait I KNOW but Im not allowed to post anything deragatory, if thats how its spelt. Either way rent if you plan on buying just to see what your getting so you dont waste your money, with the hip-hop in the backround. This movie is just ridiculous. you want a cool Zombie flick check out any of the below mentioned well woth spending your money on....-Dawn/Day/ Night Of The Living Dead ( the George romero Trilogy )- Lucio Fulci's 1980 gore flick Zombie aka Zombi 2-Dead Meat- Return of the living Dead 1 and 2-Re-animator, biut of a different Zombvie flick.-Shaun of the Dead-Italian gore flick, Burial Ground aka Nights of Terror- The Beyond , somewhat a Zmbie flick- Pet cemetary 1 and 2There are a ton of releases in the next 3 months of zombie flicks all should be good....(...)"
4,V TAC Review,"If you like rock and roll with a pop feel you might want to try out the self titled album by V TAC. Some of the songs lean toward a TOM PETTY or WILCO sound but the song ""Santa Cruz"" has a SUGAR RAY groove. ""Since you've been gone"" is a nice acoustic rock tune. These guys have been performing in the east Texas area in the past."
4,"Comfortable, good looking shoes","I bought the one with the red stripe. The leather is very soft and comfortable. I also tried the Liga on and the fit was slightly roomier compared with the Brasil. But I opted for the Brasil as the leather quality was better/more supple (reflected in the price) and the design was sleeker/classier. I have worn them for a few days and they are very comfortable, even on long walks. Although new, it didn't give me any problems like blisters. It is also very light but provides enough support for the feet (unlike some driving moccasins). I am absolutely satisfied with them and will give it 5-stars if it passes the test of time -- durability. Only time will tell."
5,Very good,"I played alto sax in high school and am relearning the sax after 50 years away from it.I have been very satisfied with this instrument. Based on the reviews here, I ordered a Yamaha 4c mouthpiece and a Rovner ligature with this sax. The sax seems to play in tune and with a good tone. I have no problem with the low notes, other than finding the keys, ( just need to practice more.) This was definitely a worthwhile purchase, especially at the price.I have also bought the L J Hutchen clarinet and am pleased with it as well."
5,Great instrument...,"Great saxophone! I bought my LJ Hutchen sax about a year ago from a music store for a much higher price (I really kicked myself when I saw it here for so cheap!) I am buying another one for my nephew to play on for his school band this coming fall, and this time through Amazon! This sax has a clear sound and it really plays great. I know my nephew will love it!"
3,Ok - had issues right away,"I ordered this saxophone for my daughter who is starting band in 5th grade. Don't know how long she'll play or if she'll like it, so didn't want to spend a ton. However, if she does keep up with it, I didn't want her to have junk. So, decided to go middle of the road. The instrument is OK, but right away she started having issues with the valves. One still doesn't close properly, so the band teacher wrapped a rubber band around it to keep it closed. A button fell off one of the keys - super glued it on. The mouthpiece had to be adjusted because it was bending the reeds therefore making it difficult to make sounds... Bottom line is...you get what you pay for. The problems aren't worth my time sending it back or dealing with the seller, so just took it to the local music store for adjusting. Hopefully, nothing else will go wrong with it."
5,LJ Hutchen Alto Sax,"My son plays the alto sax for his school band! He wanted to continue throughout the summers, so I purchased this sax through his band instructor. The price was reasonable! Easy maintainence. Quality of sound is beautiful! I am very pleased with this saxophone!Definitely recommend this product!!!!!"
2,Get what you pay for?,"Hard to believe this item is so well reviewed. I suckered for the price and now have an instrument that is not only difficult to play but impossible to tune! I took it to a professional musical instruments shop and threw away some more money as they could not tune it. It is discordant with play-along's. A lemon? Or did I just get what I paid for? Either way, painful to the wallet. Going to bite the big-bucks bullet and get a Yamaha."
5,Excellent service from Hyson Music,"Hi,I bought it for my son as he starts middle school band music. I do not play so can not say how good is the sax except it looks shiny to me :-). One thing I definitely need to comment is thanks to Hyson music staff, I got the sax 1 day after ordering it. Otherwise, I will hear whining from my kid for weeks (until he got his sax).Great work!"
2,Falls short of expectations,"The tone of this book is condescending to say the least, and compared to other screenwriting books does not equip the reader with the confidence to write a screenplay. The ""e-alerts"", ""e-facts"" and ""essentials"" sidebars are simply present to fill out the book and do not complement the text at all. This, and other similar books, could do well to invest more time in the sample scripts included."
2,interesting and disappointing,"I watched this DVD last week and the best thing about it was that i could remember watching some of these performances on tv in the early seventies when i lived in Holland and watched the German live music show Beatclub on saturday afternoon, beatclub later on became musikladen, but i think the majority of these clips were from the beatclub era. From memory there should be much better material available than what we get here. Some of the clips are ok, but on the majority the sound is dreadful and it only has historical an sentimental value. I was thinking of buying other musik laden titles but after this I think i'll give them a miss. If you want good sounding historical stuff buy Woodstock orthe Great Whistle test compilation. Highlights for me were Santana and Procol Harum with an outstanding performance by BJ wilson, their drummer."
4,New to the Game,"This is a great book for beginners or players new to the game of Poker. This book provides sound advice and a great base to build your Poker game on. If your looking to purchase your first Poker book this one is an excellent ""first"" book. I give the book four out of five stars because it has sound content but lacks intermediate and advance stradgies. (There are other books for that once a player is ready) For what this book is (a good solid foundation) it's worth five out of five stars but it is by now means the ultimate Poker book."
2,Not quite as good as some others,"This is a fair book, but it is not near as good as Peter O. Steiner's ""Thursday Night Poker."" Andy Nelson's book can't decide whether it is for beginners or advanced, so it tries to fit advanced technique into too short of space. It barely scratches the surface of any of the topics it brings up. When it doesn't do that, it simply says, ""Play so tight that you don't even have to think. Fold 99% of your hands."" That does not make for a fun night, in my opinion."
4,"Not as good as Vol. 2, but still an MST3k classic.","As someone in my early 30s, I find it hard to believe that our parents were actually expected to take these short educational movies seriously! Not only are the shorts fun for us younger generation to watch, but those who actually saw them first-hand will enjoy re-watching them as well. We watched the video with my boyfriend's parents (who are in their mid-50s), and they got a kick out of seeing the shorts now. A few of the shorts on Vol. 3 are a little boring, but the ones about bread sales and a delayed honeymoon make up for th rest."
3,"Not the best, but funny nonetheless","I have wathed every Shorts tape out there and I have to say that this one is perhaps the least funny of them all. From the boring (Ice cream sales) to the Roger Waters-Pink-Floyd type Cars of tomorrow, the shorts are way too long or just not that funny. However, if you are in to MST3K it is a must have."
3,The Worst of The Shorts,"Okay, don't get me wrong here; any MST3K fan is going to love this. If you're a freak who would do anything to see those two robots and the guy comment on stupid short subjects, this is the video for you.However, some of the shorts are either too long and downright boring (the short about sorting ice cream immediately comes to mind). Plus, after just seeing the hilarious ""Shorts Vol. 2"", this was very disappointing. Most of the topics covered in this one aren't all that heavy-handed (like the hilarious train-crossing film in vol. 2). They're mostly just kinda dumb.Like I mentioned above, though, you'll still find enjoyment from this if you're a MST3K junkie. Best shorts are ""Speech"", ""Land of Tomorrow"", and that totally stupid one about some angel who has to help a couple go on a honeymoon. Otherwise, check out the other ""Shorts"" volumes before this one."
3,Good read for someone who grew up in this area.,I went to school with the younger brothers of the author so I wanted to read it because members of my family were mentioned in the book. The author did a very good job of describing day-to-day life on a farm in those days and in that area. Her description matches very closely what my own parents told me of those days when they owned a neighboring farm.
4,Crick Kids,"Found the book very well written. It was very interesting to me as I grew up on one of the farms she wrote about. My wife did not grow up in the area and found it well written also. The last chapter was done well, in bringing the book to a close."
3,Too small,I bought these for my husband who has a 2006 F150 Northland Edition 4 door truck. He told me to send them back(I didn't) because they are to small for the rear seat. They look very nice but don't fit very well.
5,I think that this book is very well written.,"This book is one of the most interesting books that I have ever read.It's about a little boy that faces a rough time in South Africa because he is different.The story goes through a lot about boxing and the mind.I believe that it is a ""must read"" book."
5,One of the most wonderful and memorable books I've ever read,"You'll love Doc and Peekay. The characters are memorable just like ""Lonesome Dove"". The sequel TANDIA is out of print. What a bummer."
5,Words Cannot Express......,"Nothing short of amazing. A must read. I loved it from the first page and couldn't put it down. I could read it again and again. Every few months I have to pick it up to refresh my memory. Every time I still cry, I cannot wait to read Tandia. If you thought the movie was good just wait untill you read the book! Even better."
4,South Africa,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It's one of those stories that you just don't want to end. A real good read. Buy it, you won't be dissappointed."
5,Couldn't Put it Down!!,This was an awesome book. It is so deep and has so mush meaning. I got so attached to Peekay and couldn't stop reading. I did it over the summer for highschool and a book half as long took more time. I only wish i knew his real name. I guess that isn't really relevant to the book anyway.
4,Compelling and illuminating,"The Power of One is a very compelling and intriguing story. As you can tell from other reviews, it often changes the lives of those who read it. The book is very empowering to the individual indeed. But beyond that it also illuminates much about the origins of fear and hatred. Against the backdrop of P.K.'s story of triumph, the reader can actually learn a great deal about some history of the numerous conflicts in South Africa's past and present. The conflicts are presented in a very real, accurate and understandable manner. (In other words, they are NOT an outsider's stereotypical extrapolation of what went on.) A South African friend of mine who does not care to read novels claims this is the only book he has ever read."
4,Homerun potential but hits a triple,"The author writes an entertaining and engrossing book about a boy, Peekay growing up in South Africa who starts off life challenged with no father, a mother who has a nervous breakdown and sent to a boarding school at five years old where he is picked upon and humiliated mercilessly. Peekay travels through life where he meets different individuals who make an impact upon him and helps shape him. He develops an important goal of being the welterweight world champion boxer. The book is a page turner you cannot put the book down, however the choices the boy makes as he matures leaves the reader stymied.His choice of being totally self-reliant causes him to take extreme risks and creates the sense that his earlier challenges still haunt him. He must must prove he can slay the dragon or be destroyed.Great potential but falls short of a home run.Gary Frisch"
3,A page turner.,"This is definitely a ""page turner"" in that you really want to see how it all comes out. The quality of writing, i.e., the language is very competent and reading it is enjoyable. I don't want to just repeat the positive comments in the other reviews so I'll express two reservations I have:First, Peekay, the first person protagonist, is far too full of himself for my taste. He is so much of an overachiever and happily self aware of that fact that it is annoying. It distracts from the flow of the story. For me it interfered with the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" necessary to fully enjoy the tale. It is possible this is the author's conscious intent, in which case he is certainly successful.Secondly, both the generally negative portrayal of the Boers and the entirely positive portrayal of the Africans were too stereotypical for my taste. If the contrast was needed for literary purposes, so be it, but I suspect the bigotry of political correctness at work."
4,Slower shipping then expected,Book was in ok condition- as expected. But i thought it had gotten lost in the mail it took that long to get to me. Good book though.
3,This is a book for guys,"I struggled to finish THE POWER OF ONE. I found this book does not live up to the high expectations that I had for it. I was told how wonderful it was and that it had a powerful ending. I am mystified why reviewers think this book is so good. To me, this is a guy's book with a primary focus on boxing and a brief look at racism in Africa. Some parts I found hard to believe although it is supposed to be semi-autobiographical. This is not the worst book I have read, but it is definitely not the best."
5,I love this book!,I don't review books for a living so I'll keep this as succinct and poignant as possible.I love this book and you will too.The end.
5,Believe the Unbelievable!,"Peekay is one of the most endearing protagonists I have ever encountered. I picked this book up one night while staying at my sister's house. I had forgotten the book I was reading at the time, and needed something to unwind with. I was desperate, and a Cheerios box would have worked in a pinch. Instead I fell headlong into this incredible story. Peekay is part Winston Churchill, part John Galt, part Dirk Pitt! I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. Bryce Courtnay hit this one right out of the park. The exchanges clipped along at a believable pace, and my throat felt dry and chalky from the African heat and dust. ORDER THIS BOOK NOW! You will be thrilled with it."
5,I dare you to not like this book if you can!,"I initially read this when I found it among my sister's books over five years ago. My World Literature course then watched the movie, which is good, but not nearly as great as the movie. I have since purchased my own copy, continuously rereading it a couple of times a year to remember the lessons of life Peekay experienced. It is constantly on loan to all sorts of friends and teachers. No complaints yet, except that the book comes to an end."
5,Awsome book Sequel is good too!!!!!!!!,IF YOU LIKE THIS BOOK READ --TANDIA-- THE SEQUELWhich tells the rest of Peekay's story; his road to be the champion and his work as a lawyer.I had to order it from Australia since it was not released in the U.S.It was released in Australia in 1989This is one of my all time favorite books. Courtenay's characters seem almost to come too life as Peekay transforms from a scared child into a independent and honorable man.
5,A Great Book,"This was one of the first books that I truly felt sad to get to the end. I picked this book up after a teacher recommended it and I couldn't put it down after I started. I felt such a strong connection with the main character, Peekay, and I think Courtenay did such a wonderful job in creating a picture of the characters as well as of South Africa at the time. This book was so powerful and it had such a profound impact on me. I recommend it to everyone."
5,I love this book!,This book is fantastic and quite possibly the best book I have ever read! It should be required reading for HS students! I'm looking forward to more books by Bryce Courtenay!
1,I know I am in the minority here.,"Okay, so this book does follow all the conventions of an epic or the hero's journey that we all learned about in high school--you get the supernatural, the mentor-guides, the entrance into the womb-like space of the cave. In the end, however, the writing is trite. He actually writes basically, ""They passed like trains in the night."" The narrator, Peekay, for all of his concern about naming, seems little concerned about the naming of black females, only white males. All of the black women are named in relation to him. All. And in the end, I find that just a tad disturbing, especially if I am to swallow that he is this ""leader of Africa""--the reluctant voice of the people, etc. etc.On the other hand, this is a fast read, and in actuallity a somewhat good read for late junior high school students, early high school students about the power of believing in yourself. Just read with a discerning eye."
2,Bad Book,"This book was not worth reading. Unless you have a lot of extra time, don't waste your time reading this."
5,Who wouldn't like Honesty?,"This is truly my favorite book, although technically not the ""best book I ever read."" It is not just the events in the book that are compelling, but the exploration of the soul that sets the stage for some true soul-searching. I believe that The Power of One, in which a remarkable and incredibly smart boy struggles through the racism and over all hatred in pre-through post-war South Africa, is a book that can be read and enjoyed by all."
5,Fantastic!!,"By far one of the best books I have ever read. The incredibly thorough approach taken by Courtenay to describe every twist and turn in this truly inspiring story make this book an instant classic. As a humanities/social science major in college, I'm required to do a lot of reading, and this book was a literal breath of fresh air."
2,Some style but no substance,"Seeing all the rave reviews for this book made me feel a need to add some balance to save others from purchasing this mental comfort food. IF YOU MUST READ IT, GET IT FROM THE LIBRARY!When I read the book the action carried it along, but when I'd finished it I was totally unsatisfied. At even the low level of self-examination of the book itself the plot was unrealistic. It was all too easy. The hero had everything work out just right for him. He never suffered real setbacks and everything he touched turned to gold.If you accept the message of this book, eternal vigilance is more than you need to pay for freedom; if anything goes wrong the good guys will always win through. Yuk!"
2,Junk Novel,"If The Power of One was a western, first person, and like this protagonist told of his great and fast intelligence, draw, and pugilism it would be printed in paperback only, no. 10 font, and considered a junk novel. This is a simple minded read, with a thin plot and a self possessed central character. I would not rank it as a great literary accomplishment. But apparently I'm in a minority."
4,A great read highly recommended for ex-South africans,A great book for all South and Ex-South Africans
5,Wonderful book.,"I am a pretty slow reader, and anybody that has read this book can tell you that it is 500+ pages long. At first, I cringed when I first picked it up and felt how heavy it was. (I had to read it for school.) But, I read this book in 4 days. It was sooooo good, I could barely put it down. It is well worth the time it takes to read it. The cast of characters is so well written, and the plot is so engrossing, that you get sucked into reading this for hours upon end. Go get this book. IT IS GREAT!"
2,This edition does the book no justice,"This edition does the book no justice. I read the original version, and the story is so much more poignant and well-written in that edition that I was astonished by this one. The editing was terrible and removed a lot of the humor of the original. Definitely do not buy this version.Otherwise, The Power Of One is one of my favorite novels. It is moving, emotional, and surprisingly humorous at times. The storyline is inspirational and touching. Not only does it tell the story of Peekay's triumphs, but it tells the story of South Africa itself throughout World War II. It's an excellent novel, and one that I highly recommend to fans of all genres."
3,"""grizzly"" ending","I was enthralled by the book and emotionally committed to many of the characters. However, Peekay's sojourn to the mines was inexplicable to me as was the final scene. It was as though the author got tired of his story and just wanted to wrap it up. I would invite Bryce Courtney to give it another try."
5,The Power of One empowering each new Generation,The Power of One came to me at an important time of my life and empowered me in the face of hardship to continue on. I recommend this book to all of my students.
5,Powerful!,"This powerful book had me reading when I should be doing other things. Bryce Courtenay really gets the essence of South Africa. While Peekay, as a character, may be viewed as ""too good to be true"", I believe the story is in the overall message. I watched the film after reading the book, and angrily wondered how such a travesty was allowed to be made. The film chose to ignore what I consider to be many of the important elements - how Peekay was inspired by Hoppie & Doc, his home and community life, his role as a leader, in order to hammer home (not very well) the evils of Apartheid. This was just one of the themes which the book was able to put across in a much subtler way."
5,Brilliant,"This book is absolutely one of the best I have ever read. It was extremely difficult to put down. I would also like to point out that I made the mistake of renting the movie after reading the book. The movie was pathetic. It was hard to believe that they movie-makers could claim to have based their film on the book. So, if you read this book, do yourself a favor and don't see the movie."
5,One of the best books ever,"The power of one is a must read for everyone in this family. All of us have read it multiple times. In short, it is an inspiring story of a focused and talented young man who persists, perseveres, and ultimately prevails. The settings sre lush, the action is gripping, and the outcome uncertain. Who could ask for more from a book? Or from any experience, for that matter? Thank you BC, for a great experience. You have entertained, educated, and inspired us."
4,Power of One,"Interesting tale.Unique setting-South Africa.Author's own story (or wish fulfillment tale).?Super boy.Well writen, however, could have been edited to shorten boxing tales.hjdSouth Africa Coming of Age Conflicts with Boers Education given by Doc important. Music and horticulture. Positive story"
5,Power of One Review,this is perhaps one of the best books i have ever read. this book moved me and stirred an urge to take up boxing and maybe visit South Africa.
2,Selfish Power of One,"This book was recommended by a friend, and online I was amazed by the number of positive reviews the book received. How could I not read this book! I was drawn into this fantasy tale from the beginning, and then it dawned on me that Mr. Courtenay wanted me to take him seriously. In a fantasy, you may learn 4 or 5 languages at the age of five and be fluent in them for the balance of your life. In real life, I doubt it. In a fantasy, a white boy may be a leader of the tribes of Africa. But not in real life. I think this is just an egoistic novel of Mr. Courtenay's perfect self. Maybe I could have bought into the tale if Peekay had turned around to contribute one good thing to his fellow man (And I don't count secretive supply of tobbacco in prison as a good deed). Even in the end, all the mentoring he received was used for revenge. I was so disappointed. Grow up Peekay."
3,I had to read it for Freshman year in Highschool,"At the end of eigth grade, letters were sent home to the hnrs lit students on the books they would need to read over the summer. My class had to read Power of One. At first, I thought the book was really slow and I hated how much violence, profanity, and sexual encounters 5 year old Peekay encounters. But after you get by the 50 page mark, it does get better. Peekay meets some incredable people that come and go in his life and he needs to learn how to deal with losing a friend. Peekay's goal is to become welterweight champion, like one of his friends, Hoppie, that he meets. Though, by the end of the book you never find out if he becomes champ. I guess that's why there's a sequal, Tandia that I've heard is better than The Power of One. This is not a book I would have just checked out of the library and read for fun, but overall I'm glad to hav read the book."
3,the power of one,"A beautiful and descriptive narrative of the life of an English boy. His human spirit is compelling, passionate and tough as he survives the rigors of boarding school with Africaans-the Dutch; the seemingly sworn enemies of the British.Peekay overcomes this and goes on to boxing championships, not easy for his moderate frame. He learns everything he can from every one who crosses his path. Anything for his ultimate success in South Africa. Full of positive forces incredably un-related to race. I enjoyed the book and film, but, wished there was a bit more light shed on apartheid.By Elizabeth Laine, author of, ""A Butterfly Landed an Eagle""."
3,Another Interpretation of Maturity,"Bryce Courtenay's The Power of One deals with the concept of maturity much like JD Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. Though, it deals with the concept in a more positive form. As readers follow the story of Peekay and his struggles with growing older, we learn to be involved in the story to the point where we are proud of his accomplishments and disappointed in his failures. The Power of One is a story that everyone will enjoy whether you are growing older, or are already mature in age and intellect.Zachary B. MedinaAuthor of Decador"
5,the best book I'v read in a long time !,"I was so ingrossed in this book , had all I could do to put it down. So very well written,I was right there in the book, feeling all of it the whole time . I never had a clue what was around the corner , so many shocks laughs and heart aches ! I Was sad to finish the last page. It will be very difficult to find another book to follow."
4,On a whim,"I grabbed a sampler cd with a song from this album on it. At first i thought it was Tool, at least the begining of Up to Me sounded like a Tool concauction. Now i listen to alot of things that aren't mainstream and if this band is...i will say then there might be hope for mainstream after all. So i bought this cd and played it. Its got movement, the 4 guys are talented and have alot more balls than alot of other bands that you hear all the time.Get this cd asap! its sure to be on a few peoples top 10...unless your stuck reading off the billboard top 100...(cause we all know thats where all the best music IS located...)"
2,ehh....,"I recently saw OFM, they opened for Dir en grey at LA (shameless pug for my favorite band: CHECK OUT DIR EN GREY!!!) the impression I got from them was...none. They were ""lack luster"", not very memorable, they sound like a dumbed down and angrier depeche mode to me. They do have a different sound from most new bands but they have predictable time signatures, don't really ever stray from convention, and the overall musicianship isn't very impressive. They don't sound like Tool at all to me, mainlt in that Tool are great musically, having one of the best drummers alive, and this band is mediocre at best."
4,Slow but good,Pretty predictable but that didn't take away from how good of a story it was. Also reads very slow but it complements the plot.
2,Good thing it has a 10-year warranty...,"...because although it works well when it works, it doesn't seem to last very long. We've gone through two of them in the past 5 years. I'll edit this review to let you know how the return process goes."
1,item didn't come - possibly lost in the mail,The item never came. Amazon was able to reimburse me. This is the first time this has ever happened. Perhaps it's because I placed the order during the busy holiday season but I was disappointed that it never came.
4,Informative and Accessible,"Offers an accessible introduction to several contemporary themes in comparative neuroanatomy. It's apt that birds are on the cover, as it is particularly strong on the evolution of avian cognition."
5,Fascinating History,"Every student should be required to read this book about one of the most fascinating men in history. It is no wonder that so many places in this country are named for Lafayette; he was truly a hero, and I was surprised to find what a heroic wife he had, a business-savvy, devoted woman and quite a character herself. Lafayette was deeply involved in both the American and the French revolutions, a champion of the common man even though he was born to the aristocracy. This was a highly entertaining book about a very unusual man."
2,"Great story, but too many mistakes and too biased","If you are looking for a great story on one of the American Revolution's Heros this book should satisfy that desire. That being said, this book is filled with mistakes. Over and over again I caught mistakes he made on the American Revolution, since I am very familiar with that time period.The book is also far too biased. Lafayette is shown as being the hero of conflict he was involved in and everyone else as being incompetent. Lafayette was a great man, no doubt, but Unger makes him seem as though he was a god.To Unger's credit he does make Lafayette's life very interesting, especially to those who have little background knowledge on his life, I would imagine.All in all a good story, but not a good history book."
2,Poorly researched,"This is one of those ""fast-paced"" narratives that is long on drama, but short on quality research. Should not be used as a reference at all for Lafayette's experiences during the American Revolution, especially for the 1781 Virginia campaign. Very inaccurate."
3,Written very simply...,"This book is a good starter on the life of Lafayette. It's quite heavy on information, and delves into the great relationship he had with General Washington. But the book seems to be written at a level most people should've eclipsed by the time they left high school. We must be told over and over, in flowery language, many of Lafayette's attributes or how he was thought of by Americans. Going over it once or twice is enough, because if you believe the man is great (and I agree w/Unger) then it doesn't need to be boosted up like the authors seemingly does. A good book, but it could be better....."
3,Maybe for a younger audience?,"This was the second book I'd read on Lafayette, the first being General and Madame de Lafayette. Get that one, not this.Not that this book was horrible, but it was, like another reviewer said, written very simply. Rather than having perhaps a poetic effect, at times it feels condescending -it might make a good book for a middle school student, but certainly not for one in high school. My biggest point against this book is that it seems to be attempting to overly flatter him in the reader's mind by omitting some of what we might consider character flaws, such as his extramarital affairs. If you want a more complete picture read General and Madame de Lafayette. I have since read numerous books on Lafayette and not found a better one. If you must read this book, get it from the library -you will not feel the need to read it more than once."
4,DigiFirer Radio Strobe Trigger,"I purchased this as the most economical replacement available locally when my older radio slave needed repair. Transmitter is small, light, and fits the hot shoe on my SLR.Though one really needs little in terms of instructions, I would have liked more information about battery life, especially for the receivers, which have no switch. The dealer was so confident about the long life of the 24v transmitter battery that they didn't even stock replacements. I think I will try to find a backup battery anyway.The ""keyhole"" slot for the attachment fixture on the receiver seems to have been designed upside down. It hasn't yet proved a problem, but I would have more confidence had it been designed to allow the weight of the unit to secure the holder in the keyway of the receiver.Best thing so far is that it works, and battery drain on the AAA's seems minimal."
2,Great price for an expired cartridge!,"This product is fine, but when it arrived it was already two months passed it's expiration date. This means that the printer will only work for another couple months before it tells me I need a new cartridge. On my particular printer this means that it won't print at all until I buy a new cartridge regardless of ink levels. I suppose this is HP's way of preventing people from refilling the cartridges."
3,zombie movie,"I bought this movie to support a local director Todd Cook. I met him at a convention a few years ago. He's a good guy with a lot of enthusiasm for indie film.The film has some great opening nudity. The shower scene is hot. I need this girl in one of my films.It's a indie super low budget film. It is what it is. I respect the guy for the efforts and the film is entertaining.At some points the film gets a little confusing as to what is going on. Also, going back to the building to see if the killer is still just hanging out there was a bit silly. over all good indie, low budget stuff. It's what dreams are made of."
4,Hesh Amla Herbal Shampoo,"This shampoo works as the manufacturer says. It cleans, nourishes and I got my hair lustrous but slightly oily because I don't have dry hair."
3,"Some good information, but very sloppily written.","It is hard to find much of the information contained in this book in similar (textbook) formats. However, Professor Black is clearly not paying attention to the quality of the material he is attaching his name too. The bottom line is you CAN learn alot from this book, but with a modicum more effort on the part of the authors, it could have really been a very good book. Best part is the treatment of T1 and the SONET frame format. The worst part is the fact that it is 50% filler. Also, I did not mind the abundance of typos - they were so obvious that they didn't detract too much from the learning process."
3,plagued with typos,"I cannot judge the content of the book, as i am a SONET novice. However, the preponderance of mislabeled diagrams and typos is certainly not helping the educational process."
5,Excellent SONET and T1 Primer,Great book. Explains SONET and T1 from the ground up. A must have for anyone who wants to gain knowledge in this subject.
1,Good overview of these 2 technologies.,"This book is a good ""introduction"" to SONET and T1. You may want to try some other book to get a complete picture of SONET and it's difference with new Technologies like DWDM."
5,A Night With Secret Garden,This is the best DVD live I have in my collection I have all of there CDs
5,TRES BON ENREGISTREMENT,"Je viens de visionner le DVD de Secret Garden et je l'ai trouvé merveilleux. Le son en 5.1 est excellent, la violioniste, le pianiste et tous les autres membres du petit orchestre sont très bons. La seule ombre au tableau est qu'il n'y a pas assez d'éclairage dans la salle, ce qui donne une image plutt foncée lorsqu'il n'y a pas de gros plans. Très bon DVD a posséder pour une musique relaxante."
3,Picture is so so...,"The music is good as CD. But the picture is too dark and the motion captured is not profesional...In my opinion, it's not worthy to pay a DVD to the CD quality."
2,"Good visuals, poor sound","I can't say that my wife and I are rabid fans of Secret Garden, but we've enjoyed their music well enough to buy the DVD, A NIGHT with SECRET GARDEN. We anticipated a great performance since it had received rave reviews. Instruments sounded great. The sets looked wonderful. Vocals were VERY muted. It didn't do justice to a group we've listened to many times and have recommended to our friends. It sounded like an ""amateurish"" effort and not up to their high standards. I'd write this off as a technical problem and not a problem with the group itself. Sorry, I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this DVD."
2,Poor stage production and recording,"I love Secret Garden's music, but this DVD is a big disappointment: poor stage lighting and cluttered stage settings. Compared to other concert DVDs I have (e.g., Josh Graban and Sarah Brightman), this concert production and recording were poor.I don't feel this DVD adds much value to a simple CD. This DVD is sitting on my shelf and collecting dust. Sad.I hope Secret Garden's next DVD will be better."
2,Boring,"I have read some good revues about Secret Garden playing with some great female singers and had great expectations to this production. Well, I was disappointed. The sound was not good. In general I love the sound of crisp string sound from violins and other bowed string instruments. A violin is very essential in the music from Secret Garden and when this instrument is badly presented it makes this production not really worth listening to. The DVD doesn't really contain a show either."
5,Miracle stories that will touch your soul & change your life,Bits of Heaven is a treasure of a book filled with original miracle stories and beautiful original poems by author Amy Lynn. This book is sure to go places.
5,Recommend,"This movie was shipped on time and is great. All movies are closed captioned in English which works great for members of my family that don't speak German, A must see for everyone!"
3,Clarification about languages,"It would be better if the language situation was more clear. The product details state ""English / German"", however only two of the five films are available in English. Not the easiest for my mother to watch. I realise that further down it says that only two are dubbed into English, but this was not obvious before I purchased.Otherwise, she loves the films."
5,Romantic View of the Austria at It's Peak,"This beloved film series has been awaited by American fans for a long time. The main films have been beautifully restored and show Austria at it's peak through a romantic lens as the films examine the courting, marriage and life of Sissi, Empress of Austria. In addition to lovely and colorful shots of Austrian palaces and countryside, this is a nostalgic and fond remembrance of a gilded empire seen through from the personal perspective of the most popular royal woman in the history of the Habsburgs. The difficulties are glossed over, but you're not buying history here. This is a sympathetic postcard from the Ancien Regime."
5,Sissi,"Best purchase ever if you are a fan of Sissi. It took me back to the time when I saw it at the movies with my mom when it came out. (Too long ago to write). The quality of the videos are awesome.I was somewhat dissapointed with the fact that only 3 CDs are about Sissi, the other 2 CDs were new to me."
