1,A poor repeat of Myers-Briggs and David Keirsey's books.,"I think books should contribute to advance the body of knowledge instead of just using other people's previous hard work (in this case Isabel Myers-Briggs), rephrase everything and put an attractive label on it in order to sell it. Unfortunately, today some writers worry less about making contributions than making money. If you really want to learn about different personality types, I strongly recommend ""Gift Differing"", the work of Isabel Myers-Briggs, an INFP woman who genuinely spent her life researching this subject. Her book DOES cover career choices."
3,2.9 stars ~ possibly useful for you,"This book is a well-written and highly accessible introduction to the Meyer-Brigg's 16 personality type system.As an INFP type, it was a relief to read in print a reflection of my own sentiments I've expressed to others about my own views (in lieu of my personality): how I can't get a job doing just ANYthing that's ""hot""; that I have to feel I'm fueling something I believe is truly meaningful; etc. So, this book can help with issues like self-acceptance through this validation. But, I am another INFP among many that is a bit tired of being portrayed as the Human Resources type or that social occupations are generally a best fit.This is may help you identify some of your general needs from your career. But, if you truly have a problem with vocational guidance then you will probably need a heck of a lot more than this book."
3,incredible but nevertheless entertaining,"I had made note of a May 1996 Chicago Tribune review that had summarized ""The Key to Susanna"" as 'part thirller, part psychological character study'. This book served as my entertainment in the Lincoln, Nebraska airport awaiting Chicago weather to clear to allow for takeoff. I was engrossed enough in the psychotherapy angle to miss the first announcement of flight delay. However, about half way through the book I found myself examining the cover art and reading the reviews of Norman's other novels and realized that I had been tricked into reading a contemporary romance! The joke was on me, though, as I was taken in by every unbelievable plot permutation. I was as interested as Peter Strauss, the therapist, in finding the key to Susanna, regardless of the incredulousness of her story. If 'part thriller, part psychological character study' catches your novel mind's eye, give this novel a chance."
2,"It's a Mess, but Better than Nothing","This book is a such a mess, but if you love the series, it's better than nothing.It's a shame that the authors, who obviously love the series, spent all the time to write the book but didn't bother to have it proofread or copyedited. It is replete with typograhical/grammatical errors, and incomplete sentences for which they should be ashamed. The episode synopses are particularly bad.There's a lot of good information in there, but it's frustrating to wade through the very bad writing.Take a pass on this one and wait until someone writes a real book on HGWT.What a shame!"
1,What a shame,"""Have Gun, Will Travel"" is one of the greatest series of all time. It's a shame that this book about the series wasn't written by someone who was familiar with the English language."
3,Not what it seems...,"The title is a little misleading. Good coverage of the making of Have Gun Will Travel however not much coverage regarding the Paladin character. Seemed more a rehash of Richard Boone: A Knight Without Armor in a Savage Land. I did enjoy the book, however I would have enjoyed it a lot more if they had brought out more information regarding the character. The Paladin character was what made Have Gun Will Travel the popular show that it was. Companion books are suppose to give you better insight into the show and the characters."
3,HGWT Companion Book,"Interesting reading, but writing was amateurish and editing was poor at best. Photos, while often ones that I had not seen before, were so badly presented as to be worthless. Not a good value, but there is so little available on Richard Boone one tends to take what one can get."
3,Better Than Nothing.,"I am a big fan of HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL! This book is full of typos, plot mistakes and character errors. Having said that, it does give the basic story of each episode, but there is a better book to be written about this ground breaking television series."
1,Not effective for any sort of workout,"I purchased this video in hopes of changing up my indoor training routine. No such luck. The camera view changes almost constantly, therefore when you start to work up a hill, 15 seconds later the view changes to s flat or downhill. THere are several views away from the road altogether. If you want scenery, this may work fo you. If you are looking for something that even remotely resembles the view off the bike while riding, I recommend that you look elsewhere. For now, I will stick with Spinervals and CTS training videos. They are at least effective in the workout aspect."
4,California with Jock Mahoney,"I was happy to find this dvd on Amazon and see that others remember Jock in many different roles other than the ones that made him well known. I'm grateful that they make their mementos available to us/others, especially at prices that could make a whole library afforable. I continue to be frustrated and disappointed in the graininess and loss of detail in these old black and white movies, but maybe this something is better than no thing. (I would love to see again Jock's fabulous smile, sharp and handsome.) Some are better than others, color, even from the same vintage, is much clearer. Wish someone could ""fix"" them for maximum enjoyment. I never know if I'm getting the best copy available. But for now I just have to squint a little at fuzzies and shadows. He's still worth a satisfying glimpse of any kind. Marion"
1,Incorrect running time,"The only reason I purchased this exercise tape was the running time of 52 minutes. Once the tape arrived, I find a 32 minute running time. I enjoy an hour of cycling and am disappointed that I was short changed. Please be aware that the information presented for this product is incorrect."
4,Top CALI ber!,"I really enjoy this tour of California. This VHS offers vast terrains that give an excellent workout to any degree of cyclist. The soundtrack is enjoyable and lends itself well to the on screen scenery. The only disappointment for me was that a lake tour segment was omitted that used to close out this production but still, this program is worth the investment."
2,California,"It's a very sad,sad day..with tech.that they can't put Mr.Mahoney's movies on a 100% great print.I remembner a western he made..I'm very sure it was made in the mid 1950's by studio UNIVERSAL-INTERNATIONAL...where Jock wears a hostle with cards on it...like ace of diamonds,etc.I just can't remember the title..DARN!Wish someone could help me. Anyhow....JOCK MAHONEY...was a stunt man & a very underrated ACTOR!!! So come on you MOVIE STUDIOS....bring him to us that are waiting! ThankyouJack"
5,A great chamber music collection from wonderful players,This is a great chamber music collection from wonderful NY players.I love the clarinet playing of Stanley Drucker and the bassoon playing of Judith LeClair.
4,Get it if you like your pop a bit more mature,"Jennifer has an amazing voice and is a gifted songwriter, but she isn't a name you hear on radio very often unless you go looking for it.This is a very solid CD that offers a little bit of everything. Her point of view is very mature and a welcome break from all the teen pop that saturates the airwaves. Listen to it all the way through, you will start playing it over and over."
2,Cute but uncomfortable,"These shoes are very cute but horribly uncomfortable - very, very stiff. I had to return these because I couldn't wear them."
4,"Adorable, but a problem for people with narrow heels","These shoes are adorable and get a ton of compliments. However, they slipped off the backs of my somewhat narrow feet to the point where I couldn't wear them. I took them to my favorite shoe repair shop and they put thick inserts in the back which hold them in place nicely."
2,How Did This Book Get Published?! Nothing Here!,"This book gets a rating as high as ""3"" simply for the effort it took to get into book form so much saying so little. How this author purports to be a wizard in business and technology will be a mystery to readers if they can wade through this rather disjointed and relatively uninteresting work. It's entirely conceivable that this effort may have damaged the credibility of the author among her most important peers."
4,"It's Not Release 1.0, but for the price, it's worth it!","Not nearly as in-depth and enlightening (or even thought-provoking) as Release 1.0, but at the price for the book, it's a nice, light digest. Dyson's not really treading brand new ground here, but for anyone who's starting out in Educational Technology, or interested in design, it's a good read and lacks a lot of unnecessary jargon. Aaron E. Silvers (asilvers@students.wisc.edu), Middleton, Wisconsin"
1,What a dispointmen,"I wasn't expecting much... but from what I'd heard, this woman is very smart. Still, I was sorely disapointed. She's done a lot, but her stories were BORING. Little insights... you can get much better from dozens of other books. I wouldn't even recomend it to a newbie."
4,A likeable book that almost delivers on its promise,"Having anticipated it for several months, I was quite excited when Release 2.0 was, well, released. The book is easy to read and Dyson herself is extremely likeable... likeable enough that I realized as I was reading that I was working very hard to pretend that she was saying things I hadn't been reading for years in alternative publications.However, to give Dyson her due, she's writing for a relatively mainstream audience, and in this capacity the book is a quite digestible, realistically optimistic, and well-reasoned distillation of a dialogue that's been taking place for some time. Net citizens who've been around the virtual block several times might find that reading the book gives them a sense of deja vu, but I'd still recommend it to my mom, my sister, and the guy at Starbucks who keep asking me about my job ""working on the internet."""
1,"A very disappointing book, not worth the money.","The book is very shallow and repeats all the tired old examples (such as telecommuting) of the benefits of the digital age. Some of the examples were so trivial as to be ridiculous (such as the discussion of posting resumes on the internet). Despite being touted as a leader in the digital age (maybe thats just hype to sell the book?), the book falls far short of the title."
2,Disappointed at her book considering how famous she is,I haven't learned anything from reading her book. Read Customers.com by Pat Seybold
2,We either know this or we still don't,"I tried hard to appreciate Esther Dyson's book Release 2.0: A Design for Living in the Digital Age, but failed. Briefly stated, the problem for me is that the topics she deals with, while important, are presented in a rather bloodless, chatty techno-speak, that either states the obvious or leaves the reader wondering what she is talking about. I kept going, hoping to discover what the buzz was about this book but only succeeded in achieving that brain dead state one can reach after hours of reading business memos and reports. I didn't find it informative, provocative, helpful, or clear. Certainly not fun. There are better, less self-centered, books about the implications of living in a digital age. Dysons 'Design' reads like it was formulated by committee. I wouldn't want to base my life on it."
2,A useful community-discussion but lacks punch,"Because I'm in the industry of know OF Esther Dyson, and have ocassionally read her stuff in the computer press. To be honest I bought this book expecting more, and found it disappointing. What I found was a columnist making her living. We learnt about her network building, her ""names"" and could see how she developed those into an income stream of words covering the last 10 years of the Internet.On the other hand I thought her discussion of ""communities"" was thoughtful. It made me stop and think about relationships and contributing.In my opinion there's little in this book for thoughtful people who are already in the IT industry. But perhaps for people who are looking for a ""humanist"" view of the Internet and don't know where to start, this book would be quite useful. I was thinking here of an Adult Education class or night class. The jargon might be a bit tough in places, but with a guide this book might suit that audience."
2,Too much hype about the book. Good read for the neophyte.,"I agree with The New York Times Book Review, Derek Bickerton (see above) - Release 2.0 is a good primer for the neophyte. As someone who is a user of the net and familar with the issues but is not a net expert, I did not find anything new in Release 2.0. Its a regurgitation of old ideas using worn out and obvious examples. In some ways, it presents a simplistic view of the Digital Age. After all the build-up of Dyson as a ""respected digerati"" who has the gift ""for thinking current trends through to the next logical stage"" (Business Week, Neil Gross, see above review), I was completely disappointed in the book."
2,Tell me something I don't already know,"Bought this book figuring the self-professed ""Digerati"" would have some keen future vision of wired culture. Completely disappointed. Very pompous and full of completely played ideas for using the internet. I figure, based on this sleeper I can go around calling myself a guru too!!"
1,Value for the Money But Not Worth It Over Time,"I've had two of these Uniden two-line phones, and regret the day I bought them both. The Uniden line seems always to offer the same features as other more-name brands (Sony, Panasonic), for about 25% less. Yet, they also always seem truly inferior. After putting up with one of these two-line phones for 8 months (don't even think about getting service!!), I went out and bought a Panasonic two-line cordless this week. Using the phones side-by-side every caller could hear a major improvement when I switched to the Panasonic (which is much lighter and sounds much better to me as well). So, in summary, when looking at a Uniden cordless phone, I recommend you don't try to save money and buy a Sony or Panasonic the first time."
5,Excellent Phone,"Well made, solid feeling product. An improved product vs. Uniden two line phones I have purchased in the past. All features worked great out of the box. Caller-ID feature requires simply that you have arranged to have that service with your local phone company."
5,The Best phone I have ever owned.,"I have had so many portable phones in in the past four years and they are all inferior to my two-line Uniden. Their are four portable phones in my house and the Uniden is the best. The others (Sony, V-tech, and Panasonic) are all OK. My Uniden goes across the street into the neighbors house without any static. In addition, it has a very long battery life and can stay off the charger for a very long time. I won't buy anything else from now on."
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT-Description incorrect!,The description is incorrect. This is laptop memory for a Gateway laptop. This is a 256MB DDR333/PC2700 SO DIMM.
1,NOT a DIMM,"This is not DIMM memory; it is listed incorrectly. It is SODIMM memory, for a laptop. Save yourself the hassle of the return, not to mention the three week wait to ship."
1,This is mis-labeled,"This is actually SO DIMM and not DIMM memory and is intended for some Gateway Laptops, per Vikings web site. Even dealnews has this misclassified in their dealram site because of Amazon's mis-labeling. Amazon's RMA process, though, is quite good."
1,Poor Customer Service,I sent this item back 2 days after receiving it and as of today no refund has been issued. I would like to receive a FULL refund back at this time. Without any penalties because of the lack of good customer service.
5,Auto Car Cover Fits Perfect!,I ordered this car cover for an 1987 Cadillac that is sitting in my yard in upper michigan where we get 2-300 inches of snow. The cover arrived on time as advertised and fit perfect. The snow doesn't stick to it and I broom it off after each snowfall here. I would recomend this cover for anyone looking for a quality cover for their automobile.
4,Show Me Love - Maxi Length Dance Mixes,"Excellent cd. It has four long versions of the song ""Show Me Love."" This song is still successful on the dance floors around the world. The tracks are:1. Show Me Love [Tonka's 2002 Radio Edit]7:452. Show Me Love [Stone's Radio Edit]5:303. Show Me Love [Tonka's 2002 New Club Mix]8:524. Show Me Love [Nice & Stoned Old School Mix]5:33"
3,Beautiful but...,"Although the music is great, I bought this to share with my Spanish-class students and it does not share anywhere on CD or packaging where each individual song comes from - Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador are 3 different countries with distinct cultures and influences!"
3,Lost in a daze,"Not one of Abbott & Costello's best works. Costello has some funny bits but overall I was rather unimpressed with this one. Don't get me wrong the movie is definitly watchable and has some very funny scenes but it just doesn't compare to some of the other work they put out around this same time. There are much better works to choose from ""Time Of Their Lives"", ""Hold That Ghost"" & ""Rio Rita"" to name a few."
3,Lost in a Harem,"The usual A&C; slapstick but notable for the 'Poko Moko' sketch, sustained throughout.Despite the title, the Harem appears only briefly. Tape quality on my copy was poorer than average, having a 'washed out' appearance but it transferred to DVD. The only DVD copy that I can find to purchase is for Region 1.Lost in a Harem [VHS]"
2,good start//then its downhill,after costello's illness mgm and universal rushed 2 films into production...this one is not their best....they seem to be disinterested//slow moving//one or 2 good routines//not their best
5,Like having Jim and his friends in your living room!!!,"I've been going to see this guy since '95, got all his records, but this CD is so very, well, comforting to listen to. It has a great Texas country-blues feel to it with a little far-eastern influence thrown in. Very intimate! 5 stars!"
5,Superb Work !,"How can this musican get any better than he already is ! Another great work of art. For anyone who likes Blues,Rock And/Or Blues Rock! Check this guy out!"
1,Not sure I understand it,"I purchased this because the 4-for-3 deal gave me a free item and I didn't need anything else so thought I would try to find something interesting. Well it sounded like this could be interesting but I just don't feel that way after reading through it.After looking it over and having a few friends look at this, I have come to the conclusion that Japanese poetry is very different culturally or just does not translate properly. It did not read smoothly and didn't have much of a poetic appeal either."
5,Talking Ace Super Dog Toy,This toy was one of those toys hard to find that my grandson really wanted. I came to Amazon and found it and of course I snapped it up!
2,Cork Board,"I did not like this product for the use I had in mind. I wanted to line my kitchen utensil drawers with it. I found that after having measured out the exact size I needed and cut it, the ends were crumbly. I used a sharp knife, scissors and the cutting source did not seem to matter, the edges still crumbled. But rest assured it did not go to waste, someone bought the remaining amount in my garage sale!"
5,Fabulous book. Touching non fiction book.,"We study trees in school and I happened to find this book. Truly a great book about a tree. Not just any tree but a special tree the Treaty Oak in Austin, Texas. Almost hard to read when you get to the point in the book when a horrible person poisoned the tree. Truly a great read aloud in class. Here is a link to read about it on Wikipedia. [...]"
4,garden,"according to my 10 year old daughter ""This little garden is a great thing to have . I love coming home from school each day and seeing how it had grown since morning. It grows so fast you almost don't have to wait. the grass comes up fast and the beans soon follow.it looks cute in the window . I love it !! """
5,My 5 year old loves it!,"My five year old daughter absolutely loves this (as well as anything related to fairies). The beans grow very large and the grass grows pretty fast, so it's nice to be able to watch the progress day by day. My daughter has already moved some of her fairies into their new home and garden. Definitely recommend it!"
5,awesome!,"I got this lastyear for christmas, and i LOVED it! It was really fun to paint the pot, though I Guess there could be more colors then 3 but still it was fun. I painted a cool patteren around the outside of things you would find in nature. Yellow-sun blue-clouds red- i couldnt think of anything easy so i just did a square! I made a path way down for the house, grew a little lawn for the house with the grass, and planted the beans a bit off as the houses garden. I had alot of fun keeping it up and adding the little decorations! Very fun and I would reccomend it to anyone."
4,Grandchild Delighted,I bought this for my 5 year old Granddaughter.I do a lot of gardening at home and she and her older brother have helped (if that is the right word) me when they visit. She was delighted. She painted the pot and planted the seeds. She was a little tardy on the watering but she understands how important that is now. She will enjoy this product for months to come I am sure.
5,Excellent product,"My kids are always begging for something to do. this product is the right amount of creativity and ""already done"" activity. some supervision required, however, kids learn how to take care of plants for weeks after planting. the miracle of growth is clearly demonstrated."
2,"Not as good as I hoped, but fun for awhile","I bought this for my daughter who was 7 at the time. She loved the idea and painting the dish. Downside was that the bowl is so small you can't see too much design when your child is done painting.After everything was arranged just so in the pot, it took about a week before the do-dads and extras started to get moldy. Watching grass grow isn't that exciting either. Flowers would have been more interesting.Tip for anyone who buys this - DON'T put the extra decorations in until after the grass and bean sprouts have grown."
3,"Takes awhile, but is still fun!","I got this for myself, actually. I like playing with stuff like this, even though I am no longer a kid! I had fun painting the pot and planting the seeds. A few days later, the grass started to grow. Unfortunately I haven't seen much of the beans - but hopefully soon. This is a fun kit to play with, but doesn't actually give you many hours of enjoyment. Once you paint the kit and plant the seeds (which doesn't take THAT long) you basically just check on it every so often to water it and see the plants. One other good thing about this kit, they give you extra seeds and tell you how to make them sprout using paper towels so you can see the entire process - very interesting! Would recommend, as the price is not too bad - but there are plenty of more eduacational toys out there that will occupy more of your time."
5,Lots of fun for and good for the imagination!,My 6 year old daughter loves the Wee Enchanted Garden Kit. It was easy for her to be creative without a lot of supervision. All of the items in the kit were packaged individually and the picture on the box made it easy for her to see how to set up the garden. She loves the fact that she is actually growing something and the grass seeds came up overnight...so not a lot of waiting for something to happen. Wasn't too messy. Every day we look for fairies and other wee creatures in her garden. Very cute...good for the imagination.
2,Huh?,I thought this would be fun to do as some reviewers said. So I tried it and the grass came. Boooring. The Beans came next. That was just a waste of my money. I do not recommend to people at age 11.
2,Good idea but poorly constructed project,"We gave this to our 7 year old daughter for her birthday and it was quite a disappointment. We had to order it 3 times. Each time it arrived, the sparkley dirt was open and spilled all over the entire project. The third time we ordered we decided to keep the item and deal with the spilled dirt. When she finally opened it to start the project there was a chip in the planter and the planter was really cheap and thin. Would certainly not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Good idea but didn't work out that well for us,"It was fun setting it up but it actually got MOLDY! ewww. I think it's because it's a closed container or my daughter just got carried away with watering? Anyway, it got gross pretty fast :("
4,Not quite as described,"I have not used this with my daughter yet, so cannot comment on overall quality (it might be worth five stars after all). However, the product we received does not contain animals to arrange, only a gnome. This is a bit disappointing since I am not into emphasizing gnomes, fairies, and the like with my small child at this point. However I can perhaps find some small animals to put in(defeats a bit of the purpose of buying a ""kit"" with all supplies included though). Looks cute anyway though, great for imagination, and I think we will enjoy putting it together."
2,Doesn't live up to it's name,"There are just too many great jokes out there and most of them didn't find their way to these pages. While some jokes are subjective, there are some that just plain split your sides and I didn't find myself laughing hard all the way through this rather small collection. Plus times change. Many on these pages are relatively tame compared to some of the really dirty humor around today. Not really worth the price but worth reading in the dentist's office instead of old National Geographics or Reader's Digest."
1,This book is garbage,This book is the worst joke book i have ever read. Grade school jokes are even better. I didn't even chuckle. It is very out dated. I highly reccomend you not to even think about purchasing this item. I would have rated it even lower if I could have. It is about a quarter of a 1 star.
1,Certainly not the worlds best,"First of all, I would like to say, this book made me want to vomit. But I was reading a dirty joke book. So does that matter? No. This collection is vulgar, cruel...on and on. Putting all that aside, this book wasn't funny. I've heard jokes that made me laugh for hours. I did not laugh once while reading this book. So, in my opinion, it failed. You be the judge."
2,letting loose,"I found this entertaining,a simple, fun read, with a no brainer plot.Something to read for a light enjoyable afternoon.Actually Blaise,Mary Todd, were the best part."
1,Boring!,"Quite simply this is the type of story that gives the romance genre a bad name. Simple-minded, stupid, whiny characters. The heroines dealings with the ex's where just UNBELIEVABLE! Don't even bother picking this one up from the library...skip all together. Unless, of course you go for, oh so conveniently matchmaking dogs or a philandering ex and his cruel mother who simply show up, move-in and redecorate...all uninvited and without protest. Please...no one's that gullible!"
1,waste of time,"I found this book to be a total waste of my time. The writer kept repeating the same problems with the in-laws over and over again. I figured out the plot before the stupid heroine did! And, who cared about the stupid leash law?? I stayed with this story hoping it would get better, but it never did! My advice is to save your money. Wish I had done that myself."
3,An ok book but not a great book !!!,"Lot's of sassy, slap-stick humor but not a great plot. Characters average."
4,Like An Old Friend.,"I had first read this book during the early 70's when I was Still in my teens,because nostilgia has a way of destorting things this book was not quite as great as I remembered it to be. Nevertheless it is still great a book, for those of us who understand that in History while Wars,Summit Meetings and the like have (and should ) thier place, so should the more ordinary aspects, of our cultural life. The portions of this book that deal with Ty Cobb's insanity and racism Hal Chase's corruption, ""Judge Landis's"" overated qualties, and the fact that the 1919 World Series scandal was merely a means to an end, rather than the actual cause of the overthrow of The National Commission, for me anyway make for great reading, I would urge anyone intrested in American culture, or just loves baseball/nostilgia to purchase this book here."
4,Under the Cowboy Hat: A Journey hrough the Years,"Very entertaining, easy reading, I read it in one day. I thought the account of the FOP was rather drawn out at times but know that it was very much a part of their daily lives.I think it was very therapeutic for Johnetta to write this book about her life with Elmer."
5,An Oldie but Goodie,I have given out so many copies of this book through the years. It is a topical treasure with Bible advice for every common problem that a woman goes through. Joyce explains how a woman's emotional responses to situations cannot always be depended on.I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for truthful answers for any circumstance they may be facing.
3,love old movies,"I bought this for my husband, he is a fan of old western and he is getting a charge out of watching all of them"
5,Deserted island status for me - expensive & WORTH it.,"Anyone who is a fan of hot jazz, ancient Tin Pan alley & pure hokum from the 20's, you owe it to yourself to get this disc. In addition to the mindblowing selections (all hopelessly rare 78's) that Crumb made for this CD, it comes in a wonderful little book binding and every inch of it is illustrated and hand-worded by Crumb himself! This project was clearly a labor of love and the music is joyously innocent but swinging hard at every turn..."
4,"Hear that music, isn't it sweet? Come on, baby, shake your feet!","This CD features music selected by ""underground"" cartoonist Robert Crumb, from his 78RPM record collection. All the music is by dance orchestras, and all songs were recorded between 1927 and 1930. It's actually quite enjoyable, and not as ""corny"" as you might expect. One thing that surprised me was how unimportant singers were to these bands. Nine of the tunes here are instrumentals, but even in the songs that do have singers, the singer doesn't usually play a major role. The singer will usually come in about a minute into the song, and sing for less than a minute. Of course, that's not true of the song here by Rudy Vallee. If you like ""old time"" music, you should enjoy this CD."
1,returned,I returned this item 2 days after receiving it with a confirmation saying you received it and have never been credited back to my account?
1,There is still no reason to believe in a god!!!,The five plot twists are a very weak argument for religious faith. The observation that the universe is appropriate for life because of the values of fundamental constants of nature is totally circular. Religious faith is dogma and dogma is a dirty word.
3,OK joystick,"This is a ok joystick. I wouldn't say it was awsome, though. It is definitely not awsome. It feels cheap and it is all plastic. It is very light, and that's not good because the whole thing will tilt sometimes when i move the stick left or right. The small rubber pads on the bottum don't help keep the joystick in one place very well. The spring that holds the stick in a centralized location is very loose and it is too easy to move the stick around. That's why it feels cheap. All of the games that I have don't support the rumble feature, so I don't know how well the rumble works. This is overpriced and should be around $15 or $20. If it was $15 I'd say it was a good buy. It works, but there are many much better sticks for around the same price. Get some other joystick."
3,"Drags on and on,..","This started out as an intriguing and compelling story but it later bogged down in the minute details of the characters.The ending abruptly ended with credits and I wasn't sure if the story was over or not.I enjoyed the wise ass of the lead character, but this book became bogged down in one series after another of unbelievable events. To much of a stretch for my reality."
4,"Beautiful scenery, touching story.","And an ending that will give you something to talk about. It's interesting how the protagonists' yearning for each other is so publicly muted and yet still so palpably apparent. And, of course, since the movie is set in Europe, even mundane street scenes look quasi-exotic..."
3,Slightly Over The Top,"Spaniards love passion, tragedy, danger, secrets, coincidences, fate, and possibilities fused into a spicy stew. This movie pushes all of those elements to the absolute limits of what is believable. If you are the gushingly romantic type, watch it anyway. If you demand logic, reason, or consistency, it may irritate you. All this is symbolic of the extreme places love can carry young people."
4,Incurable romanticism with a touch of weirdness,"This is a very original, very creative movie. Enjoyable to watch, entertaining and very romantic without falling into the obvious. It does get a little weird, which adds to its charm."
4,"Enchanting, artistic, and captivating","This film requires that you surrender any notions of the feasibility of the actual plot, but it is nonetheless an enchanting tale. If you enjoyed ""Sliding Doors"" or if you believe in fate, you'll particularly enjoy this. The film is beautiful, with indelible images that still haunted my memory years after I first saw this film - which is why I finally decided to purchase it. The end (and, in appropriate ""circular"" fashion, the beginning) will leave you mystified and breathless."
1,Virginia Diner Chocolate covered peanuts,I purchased these last year for a yankee swap at xmas. My son got them and he generally loves chocolate BUT very waxy and not so good.
3,Okay...but I've had better.....,Chocolate isn't waxy but there is a buttery flavor to the chocolate. Fresh in the tin - which is definately to be expected. I'm still looking for that perfect chocolate covered peanut. Maybe my next foray will find me the one I'm looking for.
2,Meh,"My wife and I LOVE choc covered peanuts. No, not the yellow bag of M&M;'s.We try all different brand when we see them.this one was nothing special over what you can get at your 24/7 drugstore. I won't buy this again."
1,Very disappointing.....,I bought this product to try something new and ended up having to leave it on for much longer than other products and my hair isn't even thick......I also didn't like the gel consistency......
5,Adorable!,I'm so happy that this finally came out with subtitles. I've seen it before but it's nice to be able to have it and see it without interruptions and with the correct subtitles.
3,"Good movie, but item not what it was presented as","I love the movie and wanted to own a copy of it, so I ordered it from a seller here. What I ended up with was a library copy of the movie, complete with the library sticker on it. I'm a bit worried that it was something someone was supposed to have returned to their local library and sold instead and as a library goer, that makes me a bit upset. However, it was in good condition and was Oresama the movie."
4,a good brain workout,This book is written by more than Agatha Christie. So those expecting to read another Agatha Christie Mystery Sorry! But you won't be disappointed. The Floating Admirmal is very interesting in that each chapter is written by an author of mystery in one form or another. This is fun as you see the writings of others. It is cool how each author gets their chapter to flow with the chapter before and after it. Chapter 8 is the hardest chapter to get through and a little boring as it is in list format Where as I feel it would have been more interesting if the inspector was talking to someone. Otherwise smooth sailing afterwards. The story ends with finding out the killer or is he/she really the killer Read on and you decide who the real killer is maybe you have your own ideas as to who killed the admiral and why. A good workout for the brain. Have fun reading and solving this unique mystery
4,Excellent Writer's Resource,"This is an excellent little resource for any writer that wants to keep their writing fresh and engaging. The categories are easily referenced and for me it was just what I always wanted, but didn't know it until I found it."
1,Poor Reliability and Warranty,"I have a... Sony DVD player. Sony claims a 1 year part/90 day labor warranty. First, the machine simply stopped working after 5 months. Second, to send it in for warranty repair, Sony wants $92.00 for labor, upfront, plus I have to pay for the cost to ship the item. They don't assess the problem and then give you an estimate, permitting you to decide whether or not you want to go through with a repair. Third, when I noted that the cost to repair closely approaches the cost of a new machine, their customer service representative told me I should have purchased the extended warranty.My suggestion is, buy a more reliable product, not a Sony. Check out what the warranty, when you purchase. Select a product with 1 year parts and labor. Otherwise, find out what the manufacturer charges for warranty service.Watch out for deceptive warranty policies."
1,"Not reliable, a waste of time and money",This product does not work. Requires weekly software resets to get it to stop: it ignores the temperature set or the OFF setting. Can easily cause damage to your air conditioning system since it does not shut it down when it is stuck in the ON setting. Very expensive paperweight.
5,Terrific guide to photographing San Francisco,This is a great book but you must understand that it is neither an instruction manual on photography nor a real tour guidebook for San Francisco. It is written to help give you a chance to get great shots of northern California landmarks. It not only points out the best locations from which to take pictures but also provides other info such as which time of day proviides the best lighting.On a recent trip to SF I got some amazing shots of the Golden Gate Bridge from places I would never have known even existed without this book. It shows you perspectives from several different locations for each landmark so you can choose your favorite. This allows you to head straight for the spot you've picked out and know what time of day you need to be there to get them. This kind of plan of attack will greatly increase your chances of getting great pictures.
4,PhotoSecrets San Francisco & Northern California : The Best Sights and How to Photograph Them (Photosecrets (Series).),"I found the tips very useful, but I would have liked more details in the explanations"
4,Interesting Book,"True, a percentage of the photos either weren't that good or that interesting, but the point of the book was to inspire people to shoot their own photos of the same places. I really enjoy the book even after a year of reading it. I bought it right before I moved up to S.F. I still go back and look at the photos and read the text for inspiration. I can name a number of things I discovered from teh book. I learned Sutter Fort is in Sacramento, discovered teh Sonoma Coast, Wine Country, etc."
3,"Roosevelt and Churchill, good information but not ""a good read""","Very informative, but not ""a good read"". I enjoyed ""Franklin and Winston"" much more."
4,Madonna and chamber music,"I knew that the Da Capo Chamber Players released excellent tribute recordings of Björk and Radiohead, I was very curious and excited to hear what they'd do with Madonna's work.Madonna has used strings in her music since her Like a Virgin album, but this cd explores even more the core of her music, which is quite a test, since people usually assumes she's more a celebrity than a real musician.Madonna and chamber music? A funny thought, but here she passes the test. Even though one might argue about the choice of songs (it's a shame they selected more of her earlier material), the arrangements are really well written, staying true to the originals, yet revealing her skills as a songwriter and melodist.One highlight: 'Ray of Light', full of sparkle and energy, just like in the original version."
5,Great album!,"I had heard ""Like a prayer"" from it on Word Fashion Channel (I had forgot whose show it was) and I completely inloved in it. Musicians play wonderful and record quality is very well, so you can taste your acoustic system to play it. Just listen the samples and make your choice."
3,clue ya in,"1. madonna doesn't write music (she backs this fact up)2. madonna co-writes songs. ie. she's not the main poet on her albums. she adds stuff to already-written lyrics. did you know ""like a virgin"" was originally intended for a man to sing? gotta love this pre-fabricated pop!anyway, she's not a musician, but she is overproduced. she just sings ""her"" songs and dances along to them at concerts"
5,Extremely well-made product!,"If you are looking at silicone bakeware, Le Creuset's are really really well-made. It's pure silicone so no smoke or smell when baking in the oven. The product is made in Italy.Unlike some nonstick cake pans, this pan can actually be used under the broiler - under the condition that there is at least 8-inch distance between the broiler and the pan.Cleaning up is also easy as a breeze. I haven't tested the nonstick feature out but I would think lining it with some oil would do the trick.All in all, well worth the money."
4,VERY small - but my mistake,"I ordered this thinking it was the full size version, and when I received it, I burst out laughing! It's very SMALL, but contains all the info. When I gave it to two different girlfriends at two different times, both of them said, ""Where's the magnifying glass to go with it???"" GREAT info, but will double check size next time! ;)"
1,Difficult to use,Needs to have a usable index. While the topics are adequate don't see a way to find a topic except to scroll through the pages.
3,No category for Mother,"I like this reference, but I noticed there is no category for Mother.On page 131-132 there is a category for Father.On page 206, if Mother would be mentioned, shouldn't it be in between Mortgage and Mountains?I mistakenly reviewed another version of this book until I noticed the ISBN was different after reading a ""rude"" response from another reviewer (could they be christian???). This viewer said that Mother is mentioned in the other version. I wish I had known this before I purchased this particular copy.I give this book 3 stars because it is a good book, just missing a category I find to be extremely important while teaching my daughter things I want her to know."
3,Very Useful,I have a ministry for young girls and I use this book constantly. It provides me with location for the modern topics that we discuss in the ministry. My 16 year old daugther loves it when she has a question and wants to know what the word says she grabs this book.This book is great for young adults and those who have young adults in their lives.
5,Great Reference Toool,I gave this book to our young Son and my older Sister In Law so this is a great book for all ages. Highly recommended
5,An interesting reference,"This makes for a nice little modern-day topic 'concordance.' Sure, some of the connections between a selected topic and the Scripture Anderson references can be a bit nebulous, but this does not constitute a reason to not buy this book. In fact, I keep this little guide alongside my other writing books, style guides, and various editions of the Bible."
1,please help,this is a great reference tool for our kindle bibles. why is it not yet available in user friendly format
4,Very useful,Well organized and useful for the everyday Bible reader. Not just for the Bible student.
1,Artistic Expression?,"The author of this book has certainly taken his liberties with it. I bought it, thinking it would be something nice to have around, for reference. And granted, there are many great resources in it, such as where to find references to 'Eviction', 'Cattle' etc.However, the serious fallacies and mistranslations in this book are staggering. They outweigh any good things about it. Anyone who reads this book is going to read that 'Lent' is listed in the Bible, as well as 'Sunday' being 'a' or 'THE' Sabbath, and that Easter is the same as Passover. <sigh>I would not recommend this, and will most likely return it. Mr. Anderson needs to expose himself to a Strong's Concordance. Then maybe I'll considering purchasing and/or recommending anything he writes."
1,Useless,Unfortunately I did not notice the reviews of the Kindle edition of this book. There is no index and no logical way to get to a specific topic. The kindle edition of this book is worthless at best!
1,His worst record.,"Mighty Joe Young was a great bluesoul man, and his records are few. Maybe that's the reason why such a bad record has been released. By the time of this live album, Joe was very diminished by health problems ; he couldn't sing as usual and could hardly play his guitar. This record captures Joe at his worst, and when a member of his band replaces his leader and tries to sing ""Turning point"", it's just ridiculous. If you want to hear Joe Young at his best, try The Blind Big cd (Mighty Joe Young]or the Sonet Blues Story cd, which are among the best modern Chicago blues records."
3,Not As Advertised,"Very disappointed in this body moisturizer. It is advertised as a Ginger scent, however in reality it has a perfumery scent with no sense of Ginger.The moisturizer itself is wonderful, it glides on and is one of the best I have tried. However, the perfumery smell of this product far outweighs the positives of the moisturizer. I may try another scent, but will wait awhile.Recommended for the moisturizer properties but not recommended for the lack of Ginger scent.prisrob 01-11-13"
1,"Does not fit, Poor quality",The sticker has a white dot areaThe graphic is not as detial as it was show in the pictureAnd most of all it does not fitIt says is for DS LITE and I have a DS lite but the sticker of the back area will run over where the connection is to open and close NDS...
2,Disgusting - ink rubs off if you touch the pages,I had to get this and no other German dictionary for a class in high school. This recommends the book as being well compiled and good for information. However the printing job is the worst imaginable. Ink will rub off on your fingers if you rub the pages and as you thumb through on your way to looking things up. And to make things worse the teacher who required us to buy this and only this dictionary was allergic to the ink and got ticked if we brought a dictionary to her desk. She wouldn't touch them.To a certain extent a dictionary is a dictionary. The Harrap's Concise German dictionary will leave ink on your fingers and feels disgusting to use. Even if someone gave me one I would avoid using it or touching it. Buy another brand of dictionary and never touch a Harrap's with your clean un-rash-covered fingers.
4,La mejor del mercado,"La compre hace 1 semana y les puedo decir que es tremendo equipo, tiene un procesador super rapido, el control remoto es una maravilla y ni hablar del diseño. Lo que considero es que deberia tener puerto infrarojo."
4,Look and fit are great just the wings were a problem.,"The costume is very pretty and my sister (whom I purchased it for) received many compliments. Just the right amount of sexiness without being trampy. The only problem was with the wings. The instructions that come with the costume aren't correct for how to put on the wings. She used the costume without the wings and said to askers that being a ""Fallen Angel"" meant she lost her wings."
2,Not very well constructed for the price,I expected more with such a high price. It held up for about six hours before it was ripping apart.
3,Essentials? Too Many Are Left Out!,"Rhino Records has apparently seen the success of MCA's 20th Century Masters series and decided to get into the act. How else do you explain taking their existing excellent single-disc compilation (1995's 20-track Greatest Hits) and reducing it to twelve tracks and then having the chutzpah to call it ""essential""? First of all, it's missing three of their hits (""The Girl I Knew Somewhere,"" ""Tapioca Tundra"" and ""D.W. Washburn""). Then they include a song by Peter Tork (""For Pete's Sake"") and ignore the band's best songwriter, Michael Nesmith (""Papa Gene's Blues,"" ""You Told Me,"" ""You May Just Be the One,"" ""Circle Sky,"" etc.). [Also, amazon.com incorrectly lists ""Randy Scouse Git"" as one of the twelve tracks; it is the Goffin/King ""Porpoise Song"" from the movie Head, instead.] This condensed version of Greatest Hits may save you a few bucks, but with a playing time under 33 minutes it also gives you a myopic view of one of the most successful bands of the mid-Sixties."
2,Anything but essentials,"If something is Essential it is a MUST HAVE like something you have to have and this cd is definatly not a must have. While it stands in my collection the most untouched cd unless i want to play ""For petes sake"" and amazon says that ""randy scouse git"" is on this cd but its not don't be fooled. And for some strange reason Rhino put this totally freaky version of ""pleasant valley sunday"" in which Micky sounds as if he has a terrible cold. And shoot they might as well cut the pictures of Mike off the whole thing i have yet to come accross a song in which Mike sings a single line exept for backing vocals! I strngly suggest you to buy another cd like "" Greatest Hits"""
3,Hardly essential,"Essentials? While Rhino's 20-track ""Greatest Hits"" is available at about the same price, along with a myriad of other recommended compilations, this is hardly essential. Or necessary. Five stars for material, zero stars for raison d'etre."
3,Good But Not Really Essential,"Twelve songs on this greatest hits compilation. It seems as if there are other compilations with more songs.Nonetheless, there are some good tunes here. Day Dream Believer is my favorite on here but I appreciate several others(I'm Not Your Stepping Stone, I'm A Believer, Last Train To Clarksville). Somehow knowing that the Monkees were a TV band and that the music was recorded by session musicians make me not think too highly of these guys as compared to say the Beatles, Stones, or Who. Nonetheless, some of these songs are quite memorable."
3,Flexible Pin type Connectors may not be the best choice,"The seller (savewithsteve) is great, got everything on time and as desribed. This feedback is nothing to do with the seller or his service.I think there is a inherent flaw in this product. Although it depends on what you use it for, I would recommend going for Dayton BACT-GRB Banana Plug Pair (Compression Type). If you are thinking of using these in the wall plates which have pin type inlets, let me warn you - They are thicker and CANNOT be used. If I have to just use them in speaker and AV receiver, trust me banana types are much better choice.They are just lying with me now, opened and unused. Maybe I will use them one day."
5,flex pins,"a lot of people believe that by connecting your audio devices with pins or connectors diminishes sound quality, i say nay. these are great, and in my book a must have"
1,"If I could rate this book lower that 1 star, I would........","This book is certainly not for quilters nor is it for those who love to paint with Donna Dewberry, either. From a quilting perspective, the book is useless. The process of quilting is not dealt with at all. The project instructions are too vague for a beginner and the projects too simple and boring for a quilter or a sewer. The book provides general instructions for making simple, pieced throws, pillows, bedding items, etc. using Donna's newly marketed fabric designs. Donna's fabric designs, patterned after her flower and nature painting, are indeed very pretty, but all but impossible to find at fabric stores. The pictures of the projects are cute and colorful, but without using Donna's fabrics, are just pieced throws, pillows, and bedding. In my opinion, this book is nice to look through, but useless to actually use in making quilted projects."
2,there are better books,this book is fine but there are alot better books out there. check it out at the library first and see if it's what you want. I never used it.
5,Awesome techniques by Donna,this book is awesome...lots of creative techniques to quilt in less time and beautiful design. Love Donna! If you love creative projects but don't have a lot of time for complicated techniques this is the book you want. Donna has perfected the art of cheater quilts and passes this knowledge to you. Have fun.
4,multiple,"This is just one man's opinion, so take it for what it's worth, but i honestly believe that if Jesus were alive today, he would realize that sandals are for big sweaty comic book readers, and he would wear the sleek aerodynamic adidas Men's Tuscany NYL size 9 (i assume that Jesus' feet are a size 9). That's all speculation however, so now for some Tuscany facts:a.) just looking at these shoes makes you faster2.) they are orange, so you won't get shotd.) i personally own 7 pairs of these speed shoesI suggest these shoes to everyone and everything...men, women, animals, children, creatures, and everything else."
3,Not for the Beginner,"The Investiture Controversy has the potential of a real page-turner - especially the conflict between Henry IV and Gregory VII. While the political and historical build-up to that conflict is necessary for a fuller understanding of the issues involved, the writing is dry and the overwhelming number of names of German princes, dukes, and other assorted actors is, in a word, overwhelming! The discussion of attempts at church reform is easier to follow, but the clash between pontiff and monarch is, disappointingly, not the primary focus. The book could be improved with the inclusion of more detail of the sociopolitical background of the shifting political alliances and intrigue involving the Saxon aristocracy. Some very detailed, hard to read, but never-the-less interesting maps are included in the front of the book."
2,Talking dogs don't talk,"This toy is very cute and my granddaughter was thrilled to get it for Christmas. But the quality is poor. The dog is suppose to talk but you can hardly hear it and after one day of play, it doesn't talk anymore.I also bought talking Ace with it and he won't talk at all. Not very happy with the quality but my granddaughter won't let me send them back cuz she loves Krypto so much."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed in the toy when I recieved it the week before Christmas and the batteries in the toy were no good. The box told me what batteries to buy and I had a hard time finding a retailer that could interpret the letters/numbers to match a battery to buy. When I went to replace the batteries, they were wrong-at $5.95 a piece and the toy needed 3 of them. I wrote to the company that sent me the toy and I have not recieved any feedback. Very bad experience!!"
5,The first blood horror movie that started all,"This is an excellent horror movie. Although the first blood horror movie was made in 1963, it was very shocking to me. This should be Rated R for graphic gory violence by the Motion Picture Association of America. Apparently in 1963 they did not rate the movie Restricted."
2,lorrie,"product was sent as promised. However, the product was old. Think it had been around a while."
4,Excellent phone but lacks a mute button,"Great phone, good reception, good range. Durable, easy to use, reliable.Would be nicer still if it also had a mute button and a lighted key pad for use at night.Still, this is the best cordless phone I've owned."
2,Sound quality great but the rest was horrible.,"I was very impressed with the sound quality and lack of interference, but the constant trouble with just turning the phone on caused me not only to have it replaced once but canned in the long run. The performance was fine through 2-3 weeks but after that both phones I recieved would not turn on when you hit the ""TALK"" button the first time. It usually took about three times before it would actually work. Needless to say this was very annoying. This is my second bad experience with a Uniden phone. Take my advice, pass this one up!"
4,Features without the high price,I am sold on the advantages of the 900 MHz cordless phone over traditional cordless because of the improved range and the absence of static and other interference. This unit gives you these advantages without the higher price tags of other 900 MHz units. I also bought one of these for my parents who live in a condominium and had terrible problems with interference from other appliances. This phone has given them the freedom to take calls from anywhere in their condo or at the pool (50 yards away).
4,Follow fascinating characters and a developing opera,"This is one of those books I try and make everyone I know read. Few do, because it's longish, and it's not genre fiction. It's much easier to talk people into reading a 200-page murder mystery that a contemporary story about the rehearsal of an opera.The rehearsal of an opera?!?Well, yes. What we get here is, the lives of all the people in the plot - how they came to be at this university, working on or in the cast or staff of a modern opera. The life's travels of the people are the Canterbury part, of course. We also get the opera itself, in bits and pieces. Since some of the stories of the individuals are told in unusual formats - cartoon balloons, for instance - I only wish we could get a bit of the sheet music for the opera also.The characters are all complex and deep, every one an individual. Each one's story is fascinating; the threads they weave together, culminating in the successful performance, are an irresistable fabric."
3,Well-written,"The first chapter of When Prophecy Fails explains the theory of cognitive dissonance and applies it to examples in ancient history. The remainder of this book is a detailed report of a delusional flying saucer cult in the 1950s that made several specific prophecies that were disconfirmed. The authors predict (based upon cognitive dissonance theory) that the convinced, committed members will resort to increased proselyting in response to disconfirmation of their beliefs. The authors conclude that cognitive dissonance theory is confirmed, but I note that increased proselyting occurred in response to one of the disconfirmations, but not in response to other disconfirmations. The book is well-written and moderately interesting."
3,Failure,Why people believe totally crazy things. The brainwashing/mind control that goes on. It really makes you wonder why this happens.
1,Disappointing Story,"I am confused by the ""research"" on which this book purports to report. The forward is dated December 21, 1955; however I could not find any statement documenting the book is a reprint from that time. The references appear to be from the early ""fifties."" The authors rationalize the incomplete nature of their research and their failure to explore other explanations. It appears to be an attempt to capitalize on recent publicity related to prophcies from the Mayan calender. I say save your money."
4,Great live pop CD,"Whether you understand French or not, this is a Celine Cd you should get if you're a big fan. Favorite song is ""On ne change pas"". What can I say other than this is great pop music."
1,stereostype,"\she is fixed, she can only sing typical ballards, and nothing else! she turns-me off totally! and she is a piece of garbage to me!"
2,:(((,"THIS is an album only made for money! Celine's voice isn't at her best -just compare songs like ""pour que tu m'aimes encore"" ""j'irai ou tu iras"" with the album ""live a paris""-. Plus this album has been recorded in a stadium, which is the worst place for the sound! The most deceiving in this album is the songs its gives, half of the titles already were on the previous live album, and almost 3/4 of the concert isn't here (her virtual duets, her especial live covers, her musical moments, the persentation of her crew, lots of her hits,...)"
3,Please help me,"In a previous review someone wrote: This page is really for volume 2 of the study and solutions guide. I figured that out after ordering several of the volume 2 books. That was frusterating. The picture you see clearly states volume 1I was wondering what is the difference between volume 1 and 2. Which one do I need? I have the Calculus 8th ed. book ISBN 978-0-618-58908-1 Please email me at: rockclimbermi@aim.comThanks for your help,Mike"
4,Great,The review book doesn't cover the entire text book but it great. It came in excellent conditions even though it was used. I had some difficulty with the seller but she made up for it at the end. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
1,poor.,i will never purchase anything from this seller again. i asked for my money back and he did not retunr it. stated he didnt even know the return process. after i asked for a return he never responded to my emails again.i was highly upset. i accidently purchsed the wrong book so i was stuck with something i didnt use.other than that had it been the right one it would have helped me out in my class.
1,Received wrong book,"Ordered 8th edition and received 7th edition. Seller said he was a calculus teacher and that there was little difference, so I agreed to keep it. Turns out the teacher my daughter is taking calculus from said that it was not helpful, as the tests were based off the odd number problems, and the odd number problems were not all the right ones. I had already agreed to keep this book with a $10 credit before I found this out, so I ended up buying a new study guide at the bookstore for $50. What a waste."
4,Very Detailed,"I liked this solutions manual. Like its thicker cousin, it is very detailed and walks you through the various steps of each problem."
3,Calculus,I should have taken other people's advice: this solution manual isn't very helpful. I get stuck and have to work out the problems on my own. The solution doesn't show every step. A bit of a downfall for students who are not strong in math or math majors. Great transaction from seller though.
2,CALCULUS,SOME OF THE ANSWERS ARE INCORRECT....SOMETIMES THE STEPS ARE NOT STRAIGHT FORWARD....IF U ARE LOOKING JUST TO PASS THE CLASS ITS A GOOD BOOK....IF U WANT TO UNDERSTAND SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SCHAUM'S CALCULUS WORKBOOK.
4,solutions manual,I have used it a lot for my work and it does leave out some important steps I would have liked it to include. Other than that it is a great resource for Cal class.
1,"Should be titled ""Hint Guide""","This should be titled ""Hint Guide,"" because it rarely shows the complete solution. It is very frustrating to open the ""Solutions Guide"" only to find the same information I would have found in the back of the textbook. And often, the answer in the back of the textbook is clearer than the convoluted answer in the solutions guide. Most of the time only the answer is given, with perhaps a step or two of the work shown. An example - If the textbook asks the student to find the second derivative of a function, the solutions guide will show the original function, the first derivative, and the second derivative, with no other work to show how they came to that answer.I have also come across several problems where the answer in the solutions guide was different than the answer in the back of the textbook. They could have done a much, much better job."
3,This is volume 2.,"Larson and company does a great job in their books, which is why so many schools have begun to use his text books. I find it very easy to understand once I do more problems, however, you need the solutions and study guide for the problems worked out to all the questions. This page is really for volume 2 of the study and solutions guide. I figured that out after ordering several of the volume 2 books. That was frusterating. The picture you see clearly states volume 1."
4,very helpful,I wanted to ensure that I got the most out of calculus since I am going into engineering. This book is a great help
4,Good condition and good value,"This arrived on time and is in decent condition. The book is worth the money, as it packs a sizeable number of solutions. The explanation can be sketchy, but has the essential steps for students to work through the problem."
4,Excelent gift,This is an excellent gift for those people who collect miniature perfumes. It comes in a wooden display case great for putting in on a shelf.
5,A welcome addition to folklore,"As someone interested in folklore and mythology and those things ""hidden"" in our collective psyche this book by Paul Steward is a welcome addition. There are 60 tales of murder, mayhem and spookiness encompassing caves from New Mexico and Minnesota to Israel, China and Africa and everywhere in between. For those of us not comfortable with crawling on our bellies in the dark and, sometimes, terrifying interior of the earth this book will satisfy your curiosity. To those of you who do relish caving this book will reinforce the reasons that you enjoy traveling in the underworld. A fast read and one that will enthrall you."
4,Seems to work just fine,I have had no problem. The extra size slots are handy. Seems a good value. I have not had an opportunity to test its surge suppression and kind of hope I don't have one.
4,"Clear Message, Sound Biblical Teaching",I had to read this book as part of one of my seminary books. To say the least I had to buy this book in spanish not only because it was the first theology books I had read but It really did open my eyes to our humanness and what Gods purpose for us was to being with. This is a book that sometimes uses a bit of theological language but there are harder ones out there! Mucho amor!
2,stanton book fails to arouse,"there should have been some indication that this book was far from the standard size. it is so small that it's hardly worth the effort of looking. Stanton is a master of the form, but this meager volume is hardly the best one to enjoy his work. even as a sampler it fails."
5,Classic industrial,"Unter Null (aka Erica Dunham) is easily one of my top five favorite industrial acts of all time. I love how Erica finds a harmonious balance with infectious melodies,harsh, abrasive beats and scalding vocals. I finally downloaded THE FAILURE EPIPHANY, the debut album of Unter Null. I don't know why I waited so long but I am glad I finally did. The album totally blew me away. I knew it was going to be good but I didn't know just how good. The music is corrosive. I can hear the rage in Erica's distorted vocals, and it particularly shows in songs like ""Martyr"", ""Your Nightmare"", and ""Sick F***k"". Despite the harsh, distorted vocals, the music is drenched in pop friendly hooks which is a great contrast with Erica's seething lyrics and vocals. The rage that Erica writes and sings in her music truly can be felt. I loved every single track on THE FAILURE EPIPHANY. It is raw and abrasive yet melodic. For me, THE FAILURE EPIPHANY is a true industrial classic."
2,Less Would Be More!,"The plot is simple: through a series of events, 13 year Briony jumps to the erroneous conclusion that her sister's soon-to-be-boyfriend is the rapist of their young cousin. Even when she begins to doubt what she saw, she doesn't back down from her story and the young man spends several years in prison before he wins an appeal.The plot is simple but McEwan's style of writing throws so much verbiage at the reader that you are bombarded with far more information than you need. You find yourself silently screaming ""Get to the story!"" Instead of empathizing with any of the characters, the reader ends up feeling like he (or she) is on the outside looking in at the lives of people that you really don't care about at all.This is one of those rare books that will probably be far more enjoyable as a made-for- television movie."
1,Not my Cup Of Tea,I attempted reading this book twice and just could not get into it. I found the characters rather difficult to fathom. Lots of long winded descriptions of characters and scenes. I saw so many 5 star reviews and thought that this would be a worthwhile book to read. It was boring and uninteresting. There were petty incidents that were banal. I just gave up quarter way through after having felt that I had an overdose of descriptive writing that somehow led nowhere. This book is a disappointing read.
3,reminiscent,"Interesting, sometimes even a gripping story. I do think however, that the author has little understanding of the evolution and development of a young girl's conscience.The setting and even the names of some of the leading protagonists were very reminiscent of Mary Stewart's novel ""Touch Not the Cat""."
3,Pretty good. Worth the read; good movie adaptation.,"An occasionally tediously introspective blend of *Cold Mountain*-meets-*Crime and Punishment*. A few reasonably-hard-to-see twists; sympathetic characters, good writing. Worth reading once."
2,Slow but well written,"This book is overrated. The opening sections are so slow that I found myself skimming (something I rarely do). I only stuck with it because of the numerous positive reviews it has received. The middle section was more interesting. The book was fairly predictable, except for the ending, which was annoying."
2,so disappointing,"I was so excited by the prospects for this novel, I ordered it from Amazon.UK. What a disappointment.The McEwan prose style is in full flower but the composition of the novel left me underwhelmed. The three principal aspects of the story are interesting in themselves but the novel felt like three novellas put together to form not a coherent story but something like a pastiche. The ending (I won't commnet!) has a bit of a contrived POMO feel to it..."
3,A beautifully crafted downer,"""Atonement"" is, as noted in the other reviews posted online, a beautifully written novel. The three distinct sections are really set pieces, capturing events that resonate throughout the lives of the main characters. The images of English country life, pre-blitz London and the hospital in which much of the action takes place are as vivid as cinema. (The love scene is hauntingly captured, too.) But this is perhaps the most depressing novel I have read since ""Of Human Bondage."" Next time I crave an onset of the blues, I'll pick up else something by this craftsman and see if he bludgeons his characters again as he did here. Geez..."
4,"'her reverie, once rich in plausible detail, had become a passing silliness before the hard mass of the actual'","Beautifully written novel that really immerses the reader in different worlds- the 1930s country house, the chaos of WW2 Dunkirk and a British hospital of the same era.I also really admired McEwan's ability to describe the mind of a 13 year old girl on the cusp of adulthood."
3,"Slow plot development, but very well written.","Very well written...but dense.This took me forever to read in spurts on the exercise bike at the gym. Basically, a young girl with literary aspirations and an amazing gift for fantasy ruins the lives of her sister and her sisters lover. After serving time, the lover goes to war. The stories during the war have pace, keeping the pages turning. But the introspective thoughts of Briony are tiresome...but important. It's her inner dialouge that allows as to see how she changes and matures throughout the narrative.Nevertheless, it's a heavy read."
2,"Hyped up, knocked out","Wow, some people really like this book. I am sorry not to be one of them. I wanted to finish it and had the best of intentions to do so, but I just kept falling asleep. I wasn't all that interested in any of the characters, honestly, and didn't really care what happened to them.I have to say I thought Amsterdam was much more engaging.I regret spending all that money and buying the hardcover version of this book. Hopefully other people will get more enjoyment out of it than I did after I donate it to my local library."
3,Uneven,"After reading glowing reviews for this novel, I was very excited to start it, and found myself deeply engrossed in Part One, which is set during one long, hot summer's day at an England manor house. Treachery, lust, betrayal, and violence occur, shattering a child's view of the world around her. It is a startling, unpredictable start...unfortunately, Parts Two and Three (McEwan seems to think of his novel as theatrical, in the tradition, I suppose of Greek tragedy) can't measure up. I personally find war fiction to be incredibly boring, so was disappointed to find that Part Two was all about WWII. And Part Three, as an elderly woman travels home for a family reunion, feels surprisingly cloying when placed next to the dark, brooding suspense of Part One. The novel feels very uneven, and I was disappointed to see it go downhill, especially since the beginning is so promising."
3,Not For Everyone,"I wish I had read the Amazon.com reviews before I started this novel because I then could have better calibrated my expectations. I found ""Atonement"" to be long on theme (excellent) but short on flow. Ian McEwan is an accomplished writer but like so many others I found his book painfully slow. In truth, it may not have been but very often I had to mentally fight to stay with it. That may have been because I thought many sections were so uninteresting that I momentarily stopped caring about where the story was headed. I also found the book's characters lacking any appeal. Briony was an intriguing but very unsympathetic central character i.e. she just wasn't someone I could care about.Intellectually I liked the book's powerful theme of an individual's guilt and struggle for redemption. However, I had to work to get there. If you don't mind expending a little effort ""Atonement"" may strike the right chord in you. For me it was an interesting but not a very enjoyable read."
3,Pretentious and Boring,"The first 200 pages of this 350-page novel are a boring stream of consciousness from several uninteresting and unsympathetic characters. Only later, in this novel within a novel, do we learn that this section represents a first novel, written by the main character, which was rejected by the publisher for its lack of plot and character. The author should have listened to his own advice! Instead, he was caught up in the cuteness of demonstrating the evolution of the main character's writing abilities - at the reader's expense. The rest of the book is fairly compelling and worthwhile, but a little too caught up in the idea of its own importance."
4,Great characters but too many words,"This is my second reading of this book having read it when it first came out. It was not one that stuck with me so when searching the bookshelf for something to read, I tried it again. This second time around, it had more of an impact.The characters of Briony and Cecilia are well developed. The setting of pre-war England and England during the war comes alive. However, there are times that I just had to reread because I wasn't sure I really understood the sentence. Some sentences are really really long -- needlessly so, I think.The plot is interesting; lives are drastically changed because of a young girls vivid imagination. However, life goes on. This is a good read, but not a fast one."
2,Tedious Read,"I had waited for this book and thought based on reviews that it would be worth it. Our book club read it and we were overwhelmingly disappointed. It was over written in the beginning and although the ending was thought provoking, it was not worth the time it took to dredge through the first half of the book to get to it."
4,Hauntingly beautiful,"Ian McEwan's tale of a woman trying to atone for a horrible act she committed as a young girl is spellbinding. His language is poetic and sticks in your mind after you put the book down. Intricately plotted but not overdone 'Atonement' is remarkably human. The characters are all well drawn and possess real emotions. That is a good thing not just for McEwan's accomplishment as a writer but because it is their emotions that drive the story and make it so compelling. Had they been even slightly off the whole story would have seemed false and lacking in heart. This is a great book, and most certainly worth reading for anyone who loves quality literature."
3,"strong start, disappointing finish","Pay attention to the review that says ""at heart, Atonement is about the pleasures, pains, and dangers of writing, and perhaps even more, about the challenge of controlling what readers make of your writing."" This is exactly what I didn't like about Atonement. It started as a very interesting story about misunderstandings and private perceptions, jealousy and ambition, as a precocious young girl begins to grow up. But as the novel progresses the author becomes more interested in writing about writing, and less in writing about the characters. It's ultimately a meditation on what it means to be an author. It was a big disappointment for me for a novel with such interesting themes to turn into a solipsistic exercise."
5,"Engrossing, tragic and thought-provoking","Ian McEwan does almost too good a job in ""Atonement""--he creates in Briony Tallis a character so believable in her juvenile self-righteousness that she loses traction as a narrator. You just don't want to spend time around this annoying little girl. But stick with this book through to the shattering finish--it's worth it. McEwan has genuine gift for plot and atmosphere: This book combines the best elements of a period tragedy with a tight, suspenseful mystery. Scenes set in WW2 are horrifically real and moving in the best sense. And he wraps the book up in finish both shocking and satisfying, an indictment of both childish sins and the act of writing itself. (I only wish I had read this book a few months earlier: All the upper-class British romantic romping kept evoking in my mind visions of Charles and Camilla!)"
2,Hmmmmm.....,"So this is one of those books that you pick up only coz it has tons of reviews and everyone you know is reading it and there's a movie on it, so it must be good right?Welll it is an interesting theme but at the end of it the only image of Briony that I had was of a silly brat and not the complicated child prodigy that the author beings to paint her as. I did enjoy reading the book but only because the author does a good job of eloquently beating around the bush and making you believe the story is about to get fiercely dramatic...that never happens. The story wraps up much too quickly in a few pages for all the time you've spent tracking these people's lives. Overall the book's an easy, fast read so go ahead but do not set high expectations."
2,"Torture, pure torture.","Atonement is full of lovely phrases, but lacks the ability to carry you through the story. So many words, so little tiime.After struggling through the first one third of the book I finally just gave up and put it down. This novel is not for the reader who wants to be entertained, caught up in a good story, or likes an emotional presence in their reading. Thinking I had been too harsh in my analysis, I picked it up again a few weeks later. Same result. No heart."
1,Starts slowly.......and quickly slows down,"Terrible book because it create expectations of ""atonement"" and then gets caught up in its own underware. Asking if the following sentence is ""true"" -- ""This sentence is not true."" is comprable to the theme you are to discover and contemplate in this book. Worse, the slow development is painful.The only positive is that the book is an accurate depiction of the mean spirited nature of a dying British class system."
3,Great book!,Great book - seller was prompt with shipment. Book received in condition stated in description. Would recommend seller/book!
3,Disappointing But Worth a Look,I had high expectations for Atonement.This may be why I was very disapointed. The first 100 pages move very slowly and then the pace picks up.Ian McEwan is a very good writer. The ending left me feeling cheated. I can't believe how a lie was atoned for. There is alot to discuss if you are looking for a book discussion novel. I am sure there would be different opinon on what took place in this novel. Go for it!
3,So-So,"Yes, Ian McEwan writes beautifully. Yes, I actully liked the last section of the novel where as a reader, I understood more about Briony. But the novel felt sluggish, and the characters seemed shallow. I just never connected, which was a disappointment. It seemed on the surface to have all of the elements I usually enjoy."
1,Boring Beyond Belief,"Don't get me wrong, I've plugged through War and Peace, the Brothers Karamazov and countless other novels requiring dedication and persistence.This book does not deserve the time, effort, or money to try to figure out what the point of this whole novel is. It is painfully slow, overly descriptive and incredibly naive in the writing.I made the mistake of buying a ""best seller"". I usually stay away from them for the simple reason that most people are rather lethargic in reading - opting for simplicity over compexity and the mundane over the exciting.If you value your time, don't buy this book."
1,Atonement,"I found it disjointed, poorly written and I read 1/2 before throwing it away. I didn't even feel I could then pass it on to someone. Then I took it off my Netflix Queue."
1,Dissapointed,"The reviews looked so promising, but I just could not get in to this book at all. I checked out the audio version from my library, and perhaps it is better on paper, but I doubt it. I have made it through the first hour of the book, and it is terrible and I will not continue. The story seems somewhat intersting, but it does NOT make Sense! It goes back and forth from Celias perspective, to Bryany (may have mispelled that). And I just cant figure out exactly what the crap is going on. The images I am able to conture in my mind of what might be going on are just so fuzzy, and dreamlike. I just cant relate to this story. I keep listening to it thinking why dont they just ""SAY"" what is happening, the way the author describes things is very poor."
3,Excruciatingly long-winded,"I thought the story was good, but it could have been accomplished in about half the pages. When I read a book, I read and read and read until it is finished. I read the last Harry Potter book in three days, and it only took that long because I had to take care of my three kids. It took me nearly three MONTHS to finish this book. The first half, the majority of which was written through the perspective of Briony, was excruciating. I understand that it was supposed to be the dreamy, imaginative thoughts of her character, but really....it was simply painful to read and pointless. The rest of the character perspectives were so much better. And as far as the ending, I'm still not entirely sure what really happened?!?!?"
2,It's a mystery!,"McEwan is obviously a capable writer and constructs some fine sentences in this book. However, I found the characterisation bland and the story too drawn-out. He could have shaved off at least 50 pages....I haven't been less engaged since reading 'A Farewell to Arms'."
2,Boring,"If I feel like I gained something, anything, from a book after I finish it, I usually say I liked the book. I gained NOTHING from reading this book. No character development, poor historical context and descriptions, boring predictable story. Sentences were structured well and the book had the potential for a decent story, that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star.Don't waste your time with this book."
1,"Get to the point already, Ian!","If there was a zero star rating, I would've chosen that.I have no problem with long, descriptive books, being a Michener fan. (I've read Hawaii and several of his superlong books.) But this book takes FOREVER to get the supposedly pivotal event. (It doesn't happen until at least halfway through the book.)This book is an exercise in self-indulgence by the author. It's the written equivalent of someone who likes to talk just to hear himself talk.One of the worst books I've ever read."
3,Ouch,"There are some very odd things about this interesting book. We don't really have a protagonist that you can identify with. What we have is an immature young girl who unintentionally ""bears false witness"", incriminating an innocent man and sending him to jail. Because of this, it is a dark book. There are no heroes. Just a big OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOO.Another oddity of the book is that we are given two completely different endings, which reminds me of Life Of Pi. First we get the ending that we are prepared to accept. Then in a sort of afterward, we are told that the ending we just read is not the real one, and that the real one is in fact much worse, much less satisfactory.As I said before, this is an interesting book. But it is also an exercise in banging your head against the wall."
2,"Yes, great descriptions but a bit labored, no?","I'm not sorrry I plowed through this book, but I sure wouldn't give it a great review. ""Atonement"" is so crammed with (yes, beautiful) details that I found it claustrophobic and too dense. I wasn't crazy about the way McEwen leapt through time either, didn't register with me as true, not even true, certainly far from the best fiction. I don't recommend buying this. If you must see what all the fuss is about, go to a library.What the fuss is about is his natural talent, obvious hard work and character development. I know that sounds like more than enough but for me it was decidedly less than enough. 2 stars only"
4,"Terrific, yet sometimes bloated","Although the author could have lessoned his lenghty descriptive pros in many instances, shortening the middle of the book, it is still a terrific read. I would highly recommend it."
1,Agonizing,I couldn't wait for this book to end. I had heard that it started off slowly but eventually picked up. That never happened.
1,Worst Book I have ever read,I read this book hoping for something that would make me like it. I HATED the entire book and especially the ending!!!! It was too disjointed and the story which started out so well never came to any resolution or gave me a feeling that even with a sad ending it was a satisfying book. It was awful and I won't even go to the movie because everyone who I know who has seen it tells me how awful the story ended and they didn't understand what it was about. Critics are overpaid for their work. Save your money!!!
5,See This One Through,"Part One of this novel is slow going. Had I not trusted the author from reading a previous book (Saturday), I might not have continued. This would have been a travesty. Part Two picked up the action and intensity in the war scenes, and Part Three tied it all together with one of the most elegant, haunting and surprising endings I've experienced.After experiencing the ending, you will realize that Part One had to be written the way it was for the book to have resonated so powerfully. It laid the necessary groundwork for development of the novel's themes: reality versus perception, honesty versus artistic creativity, and real life versus fictional creation.I watched the movie after reading the novel and was also impressed with the film adaptation. Beautiful cinematography, great acting, and a good sense of time and place. The movie did, however, feel choppier than the novel, as it was harder to blend the three parts into one seamless narrative as well as Mcewan did."
5,Probably the best book I've ever read.,"And I read a LOT of books.At turns I found myself audibly gasping, laughing, and crying.This is an amazing read full of deeply realized characters whose internal dialogue captures what it is to be a human being.Yep. I've just decided: ""Atonement"" is definately the best book I've ever read."
3,"A great attempt, but tiresome for me...","I have a problem with the Brit ""precious"" thing...it's a sort of tone of ironic cuteness around children or anyone ""heroic"" that bugs me. It's like biting into something rich and finding it too sweet. After all, didn't they invent treacle and Christmas pudding and sweet meats and all that kind of stuff? I just finished a brilliant Brit thriller, however, that I did like - it's called ""Falling Off Air,"" by Catherine Sampson. Very straightforward, clear, not pretentiously wordy. Henry James and Virginia Woolf did ""wordy"" - and I loved it. Now I'm getting tired of it. I find I'm attracted to a more minimalist style these days. I want to say ""Get on with it!"" And, too, I am a bit prejudiced by the whole class thing they do in GB. I find it a bore because I can't identify with it. I don't find it either amusing or instructive and frankly, at this point in history, to belabor it feels a bit sour."
2,Overworked and Overlong,"I expected much more from this book based on the glowing recommendations. Character development is a hopscotch of scenes with no logical connection, growth, or explanation when characters do an about face in perspective and feelings. Emotional shifts are unexplained. The first section of the book was removed and distant. The story finally captured my attention in the middle section. If it had not been the book selected by my book club, I would have abandoned it within the first 100 pages."
3,Prose like spun sugar does not a story make,"McEwan exemplifies that classic question of beautiful prose vs. telling a good story. And, of course, what we get here is the lofty and well crafted sentences around something that just doesn't merit strong story-telling. I am not sure why this is so with so many writers who are deemed: ""literary"", but it almost always seems to be the case. A young girl's guilt just does not carry it. Without giving what story there is here away, I couldn't help but find much grandiosity in this person having such ""guilt"" to atone for in the first place. Very big of her to think herself to be so powerful. You know, this sort of thing. And no, it simply does not make the read worth my while. Give me a real story! At least, that's how I see it. Perhaps it's rare to have both beautiful prose and a powerful story--they do exist.For this reader, MIDDLESEX, THE KITE RUNNER, LIFE OF PI are some strong examples of good prose and a compelling story."
4,First part is the best,"I was completely captivated by the first part of the book. Theimagery, the inner thoughts were some of the best writting Ihave experienced in quite a while. Even though I could maybe seewhere the story was going, it was not predictable. There weremany surprises.The Second part was also very good, but I wasn't sure how it relatedto the main plot at first.The third part started the downhill trend.I thought the epilog was going to be bad, but after some reflectionit made a few good points that I thought about for the next fewdays. I really did feel a longing for the way things weere back in the early part of the story.There is a lot of food for thought here. A simple read is not sufficient.Great book!"
3,Earthbound,"To an extent, I see what all the fuss is about. McEwan has a wonderful descriptive talent at his disposal and creates a gallery of memorable characters in the only way such characters can come to life: through skillful showing and not telling. But he certainly sends those characters up in one rickety craft. The result? His lofty creation comes crashing to earth in flames. As other reviewers have pointed out, Robbie's conviction is an unbelievable sham, something that couldn't possibly happen in the real world, but I was still willing to suspend disbelief because I was interested in and cared about the characters.I also found Robbie's long march...Adding to the absurdity is Briony's gestural self-sacrifice, told through the labored pentimento of the last section of the book, a literary lead balloon if there ever was one. So while I respect McEwan's evident talent and was with him through much of the narrative, ultimately I was greatly let down by it."
5,Flawless Fiction; A Masterpiece,"My wife had read this novel and recommended that I do so as well. ""Atonement"" starts off measured and slow, much like an Austen novel, but the reader's reward is in McEwan's characters who are superbly and fully realized and in the elegant and mannerly depictions of their setting. The reader is immediately engaged, and the fact that half of the novel is devoted to one day in the lives of these characters is all the more remarkable because the writing is so effortless and profound and is never tedious or plodding. ""Atonement"" is simply fiction at its best; it rarely gets any better than this. Some reviewers have complained that the ending is abrupt and disappointing. I disagree. The ending is remarkable for its revelation that redemption and atonement sometimes take years to grace our lives, and then again, sometimes elude us even at death. ""Atonement"" is a masterpiece of fiction, and it is one of the most satisfying novels that I have read in the last several years."
3,revealing and deceiving....powerful novel about truth,"Ian McEwan delivers an interesting look at English life in the 30's. The story begins at the home of a well to do family. A series of events occur that will change the lives of all those involved in unbelievable ways. It is not so much the events , but they way they are viewed and linked together through the eyes and mind of a very young and naive girl and how she handles the situation.This novel is also a powerful look at life during WWII for the soldiers and the nurses. The hardships and the medical capabilities that were available are excruciatingly clear.Ian McEwan has created a vivid novel that tells a story that is both revealing and deceiving that pulls you rapidly along to the conclusion."
4,Slow reader...could not make it to the end,"McEwan writes in a way that gives the reader a complete understanding of why the characters behave the way they do. His description in Chapter 7 of Briony thrashing plants on the island, the description of the church and the house, are just extremely good writing. I also liked the way he gave the reader insight to the kind of person Robbie was by describing his room.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, but sadly, I could not finish it. I am a slow reader, and after plowing through Briony's experience as a nurse, I just was stuck and could not continue. Still, I think it is a superb book, one that is enjoyed more for the reading itself than the story."
1,Self-indulgent meta-fiction,"Rigourously postmodern and pessimistic, McEwan's hit is not much more than self-indulgent meta-fiction, with overly self-conscious use of floating third point of view. No grace within these pages. Boring and transparent."
1,Overly wordy and utterly annoying.,"Reading this book made me feel like I was reading it for a book report for school. It is so utterly wordy that getting through it feels like you're being sucked back by each phrase like a swamp. Swampy. This book is swampy. I couldn't get through it. It is so over the top in explaining the minute details of things that you forget what the hell the point of it all is. Many times I had to re-read passages to understand what was going on. It's a muddy mess of a book, and I threw it out. ""National Bestseller"" my left cheek!"
2,Atonement: Could have been a good book but,"The first 20% of the book (Kindle reader) was enjoyable: then the author decided that sex needed to be the focus of the story. It ruined it. Too bad. The story line was interesting. I liked the characters, but after sex became the story line it was ruined - sent it to kindle's storage room."
2,Painful beyond belief,"This book has so much potential. It was an interesting idea, the characters were excellent, and McEwan is an excellent writer. Why, you may ask then, did I give it only two stars? The Answer is the detail. There is WAY to much of it. The paragraphs go on and on like some kind of infernal device designed to destory my love of reading and my sanity. This book could have been about 1/3 the length without changing the plot. It's like trying to read a bad combination of ""The Scarlet letter"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"". You get the amazingly long and boring descriptions of TSL and the pointless descriptions of upper class characters that are impossible to relate to. I don't know what McEwan was trying to prove when he wrote this book, but all he proved to me is that this book is filled with pretentious [***] that only arrogent snobs with too much time on their hands can enjoy. Those of us who deal in reality will not enjoy this novel"
2,"No ""Amsterdam""","I enjoyed ""Amsterdam,"" McEwan's Booker Prize-winning novel. I thought it was a clever (albeit slick) little jewel of a book. Hearing that ""Atonement"" was his masterpiece, I knew I had to read it. Frankly, I found it a dull book about dull people. To be perfectly honest, after starting to skim it halfway through,I never finished it. As social comedy (or commentary) it can't hold a candle to anything by Anthony Powell or Evelyn Waugh. Masterpiece or not, I thought it a bore and a major disappointment."
2,"Not what it's cracked up to be, back to the library","I didn't care to much for this book, I really was falling asleep and had to put it down after Leon (first 51 pages)came home. I didn't find it interesting and it couldn't hold my attention. I'm amazed at how people have such diverse opinions about this book, this interests more than the reading!"
3,Very slow gowing,"A friend warned me that the first 50 pages were very slow going, but that he thought it picked up after that. At 65, 70, 75 pages it was still creeping along.It may well be all that the five-star reviewers say it is. But if you're the ""get on with it"" type who has another 10 books in your read pile, I think you'll be apt to move on to the next book relatively quickly."
2,good book for a first novel...!,"Ok, it's not his first but it reads like one. Very pedestrian, borish. The details are charming, a bit Waugh-ish without the humor, but because I knew Briony did something for which she would then atone I wasn't able to _read_, I was waiting for the event which wasn't realistically terrible. I didn't find it or the aftermath credible. The writing isn't really that bad but the story is told in a postmodern way that's almost cliche by now--how many novels do we need that are told from different perspectives? It's not new, it's not fresh, it doesn't inspire me to want to read more of his works. This was my first McEwan and, unless my husband who loved this book forces me, it's my last."
3,Ultimately disappointing,A very well written book with interesting characters. The ending was a huge disappointment. The last chapters rushed through too much time trying to find an ending. Not as good as the hype.
4,Very good. MUCH better than the movie.,"I saw the movie version of the story before reading it. I absolutely love the book version.The book gives you such a pleasant feeling of resolvement at the end that the movie does not.The tale is interesting, romantic, and rather capable of pulling at your heart strings.The story is actually quite beautiful and intriguing in its entirety.Recommend."
2,Ok but hardly deserving of all the praise,"This was an ok book. The premise is compelling, but the writing is so dense. I almost gave up after about a quarter of the book because I couldn't tell what it was about. Pages and pages go by without anything happening. I kept reading because I wanted to know how it turned out but it was painful along the way. This story probably would've made a great novella. Plus it's depressing, although one should surmise that in advance given its title."
3,Not What I Hoped For,"I was really into the firdt third of the book, but after that I got bored. Towards the end of the book, I found myself skipping over parts just to finish the book. I was disappointed."
1,This book is exhausting,"The only reason that I forced myself through to the end of this book is because it was a gift from someone. (I'm guessing they tried to read it first and decided to re-gift because it was dreadful.) The author has some perverse fascination with describing every tiny detail of every scene, no matter how irrelevant those details are to the story. Three pages for a woman to decide which dress to wear. Not kidding. That's all that happened, for three pages. I got through the second part by reading 2-3 sentences off of each page. The majority of it is entirely useless. It is impossible to like any of the characters, in part because the author did not make me like them, but mostly because I was so angry with this book I didn't care what happened to any of them. Any sympathy you might have felt for Briony vanishes with the self-aggrandizing ending. I am just so glad to be done with this book. I think I deserve some sort of literary prize just for reading it."
3,Push through chapter eight...,"I read another review that said the reader gave up on this book on page 80. I nearly did too due to the dragged out descriptions of everything but I'm happy I decided to finish that chapter because that's precisely where the plot got intriguing! My interest in history was satisfied too by the description of the war. Some reviewers felt let down by the ending but I quite liked it.I need help understanding one thing though - in the book, one of the characters is killed in September 1940 in the Balham Tube Station bombing - but in real life this event occurred in October 1940 - is this discrepancy intentional??"
2,The ending broke the spell,"I found the ending destructive to the story. I wish that the final thoughts, questions, premise, etc. would have evolved within the readers minds without such blatant delineation.Sorry, but the story wasn't as startling as the critics reviews (hype)."
1,Art trumps life,"Atonement is a tedious novel. The author was told as a youngster that he had a penchant for detail. Is it ever given in an excruciating manner with no purpose in sight. Most importantly, the author should have read Kundera's book ""The Joke"" and would have learned that one must stand up for inequity at the moment, not years past, otherwise your life is meaningless. Consequently, the novel is morally corrupt. McEwan has the character Briony choosing to write a story over speaking out for her wrongdoings. Two people die as a consequence of her actions. Furthermore, McEwan presents a novel as fiction, then disguised as Briony, declares that these are merely words and they shouldn't be taken seriously and if so, the writer is like God so atonement is not neccessary. It's a poor blending of fiction and reality. So if McEwan is your friend in real life, he'll choose a good story out of it and leave you hanging out to dry."
3,I gave up,"After 70 pages, I started thumbing...there's some action in here, right? The paragraphs get shorter and more happens than a breeze and a sidelong glance, right? Wrong.This isn't a novel for everyone, despite the generally glowing reviews in the book press. Although it is set in the 20th century, it struck me as more 19th century in spirit - if you like Jane Austen, you'll probably like Atonement. It's a perceptive novel of life among the wealthy and smart, and if you hold it at arm's length, indeed there is a good plot, with a lot happening. I enjoyed its perceptiveness greatly at first - McEwan does have some sensitive, striking, and original observations about the lives of children and how we get along with each other.But as I slugged it through one long paragraph after another, with the phone and the kids and general restlessness interrupting every other page - nah. Couldn't do it. Hats off to those who could."
1,Literary Torture,"Absolutely hated this book. I didn't read it all the way through, but I figure 260 pages of literary torture was enough. How this book has been so well received and turned out a movie is beyond my comprehension. This book was entirely inaccessible and boring. I hated the long winded laments on architecture and gardens and I hated and didn't identify with any of the characters. This has been the worst book I've read in a decade at least.After finding out the ending to this book after getting half way through it, I realized that the end could never justify the means. Many people disagree with this, but I just can't be bothered to read the rest of this book as it's more effective than ambien at putting me to sleep."
2,Snoozer of a read,"It is a rare book that I just can NOT finish and although this book came highly recommended by several people, I just could not finish it. I kept putting it down and would come back to it but never could get invested in the characters or the various plot lines."
1,A Travesty,"Ageing starry-eyed yuppies will eat this solipsistic-self infatuated sugar tart of a book right up as it's passed from sweaty palm to palm through all the precious literary boutiques frequented by urban liberal elites. The snob appeal is impressive; every faddish academic/critic will want one to maintain good social odor with their colleagues, dour men of letters who missed out on the Nobel Prize who specialize in the sexual anxieties of financial planners (zzzzz), and trendy California newspapers soliciting manuscripts for 30 something movie studio executives who crave ""serious"" recognition and full page advertising for Oscar nominations. Those who believe the life-style choices of arrogant prep school frat boys is anything but the posturing of conceited social climbers will enjoy this trashy melodrama. A contrived, pretentious bore of a novel."
2,Not for Everyone,"This book was extremely difficult to read, and I frankly couldn't force myself to read past part 1. I found it boring and tedious and uninteresting. The writing made me think of Nathaniel Hawthorne if he'd taken a boring pill. Obviously some people like it though, but I personally can't find anything in it."
2,Highly Acclaimed Mediocrity,"ATONEMENT demonstrates again that, when she filled her pockets with stones and walked into the river, Virginia Woolf took the English novel with her.ATONEMENT is a mediocre book, unqualifiedly in love with its own prose, which is workmanlike. Both the narrator and the characters signal their punches throughout, so when we discover, at the end, that one of the characters, a highly acclaimed writer, IS the author of the book, that the book is her atonement, then we feel that those she punished have been punished doubly so.ATONEMENT presumes its readers are rather dense, won't see right away that Paul is the one who raped Briony's cousin nor that she will marry him. Are English readers dense? are they terribly distracted? they cannot be as dense as McEwen presumes.Anyway, if you seek a contemporary British novel, highly acclaimed but actually run-of-the-mill, then try ATONEMENT."
3,"Been there, done that","I enjoyed the book, but as I was reading I kept sensing that I had read this before..don't get me wrong, I am not suggesting plagiarism at all...just the familiarity of the tone, the mood of the novels of Rumer Godden, a novelist of great popularity in the 1950s. Try her Episode of Sparrows, and then read Atonement with a different set of expectations and perceptions."
4,Atonement is amazing,"This book was incredible. I am thankful that I read it on the Kindle. McEwan's writing is amazing, but a very difficult read. The Kindle's built-in dictionary helped me with that. The story was beautiful, heart-wrenching and it really makes you think. I also watched the movie, which I love. If you like Pride and Prejudice, I think that you will enjoy this. The two are very differant, but equally beautiful, in my opinion."
5,heartbreakingly romantic,AtonementSaw the movie first and was captivated by the story. The book explores the relationships and feelings of the characters even more deeply. Writing is superb -- one of those books that you slow down reading because you don't want it to end.
5,Atonement: A Novel,I received this book promptly and in excellent condition. This book has been chosen by my book club as a must-read.
3,"Too long, amazing, not so sure","This story is unnecessarily long. I wouldn't have to struggle through the war in France, which occupies almost one third of the book. And the events in France feel arbitrary as I find out in the ending chapter.The first part is amazing. It tells about the demon in a writer's heart.I feel being fooled in the last part. It is like to say here that all I have written above in this review is a lie. I would have given the book five stars were there be a bad headache like the one I have just had. I would even say the story is too short. It all depends."
5,"If you love literature and England, one of best audiobooks ever","I skipped the movie because it looked like a boring chick flick. This audiobook was in my library so I checked it out, thinking maybe I missed something. I certainly did. The book traces a mistake made by a 13-year-old that dramatically affects the lives of her sister and her lover. It is the equivalent of the tragedy of Romeo and Juliette.It's not a detective story but one of lyrics and prose and a style so elegant. There are so many vivid descriptions, particularly about Dunkirk, and subtleties. The true villains become clearer later in the book and the answer is so perceptive about the truth and sadness of life itself. The final part made me cry for a life unfulfilled.If you love England and great books and audiobooks, this will not disappoint. I can hardly give any higher praise to the actress who read the book; it's among the five best I've ever heard."
5,A definitive example of the modern novel,"An incredible book, which I cannot recommend highly enough with any qualification. With Atonement, McEwan has set a new standard for the modern novel. All the elements are superb: story, structure, characterisations, obersevations, and an absolutely engrossing writing style. His story leads the reader in, and every page builds on the many false climaxes and leads. But the clues are all there. Just when one thinks one has worked out the story, the next page holds a surprise - and not a single gimmicky twist in the book. Such is his mastery of the medium that a simple, seemingly afterthought of initials and date turns the entire story around. Absolutely wonderful, readable, emotional, and brilliant."
3,Overrated,"After hearing so much, I read this book, but found it extremely gloomy and difficult to finish. I did not care much for any of the main characters nor what happened to them. The most compelling part of the book was the description of experiences during the Second World War. There are far better ways to learn about that era than reading this book, however."
3,A slow read,"The language in this novel is wonderful, however, it is a slow story. I found the story similiar to Birdsong but not as good. I don't think this is a novel I would recommend."
2,A tremendous disappointment!,"I picked up this particular book, because one of my favorite novelist, Chris Bohjalian, recommended it at a book signing. I found the book difficult to get through and considered abandoning it altogether at times. I kept waiting for an unforgivable crime to take place, and when it did, it was hardly unforgivable, as it was committed by a 13 yr old girl. As such, the ""atonement"" failed to live up to the title. Although the book has literary value, I would not recommend it."
4,Not quite able to live up to its hype.,"This was my first McEwan read, and while it was lovely in some ways, I don't necessarily agree that it's all everyone is raving about. It seemed to me not all that interesting a story, nor all that accomplished prosaically or stylistically.There were instances in which I found myself thrilled and smiling, times when I reread passages to enjoy something a second time. But I guess mostly I just want to convey that all the hoopla here and in other media about this book falls into the ""emperor has no clothes"" category as far as I'm concerned.It's a good book, not a great book, and I'd have given it 3.5 stars if I could have."
2,Not recommended,I really didn't care for this book. So wordy. I ended up skipping large portions of the book and then seeing how it ended. Pretty much a waste of time.
3,Deep,"Very well written, even though the story itself is less than the writing/prose. I can see this being a book in the list of literature in college must reads. I constantly felt like I was getting ready to write a book report on the foreshadows and metaphors within. However, the story keeps you going, much like the Great Gatsby. Beautifully written and easily transposed into the ah-ha's, I've felt that way before! The story itself is sorrowful and yet I am still wondering what was true and what was fabricated by Briony. Perhaps I was looking too hard for the inside scoop. This book is for a literary respective, not necessarily a story driven reader. I like both, so therefore, I enjoyed it, but not everyone will like reading it more so than watching the movie."
5,"Among the very, very best in contemporary novels...","I came to Atonement late, after having been disappointed by Ian McEwan's ""Saturday."" In that book, the writing was good, but the characters were uninteresting and the plot slow. It left me cold. I wondered what the McEwan fuss was about.Atonement, on the other hand, more than delivers. It's quite simply one of a handful of contemporary novels that I would call a masterpiece. McEwan uses language precisely, brilliantly, and without error -- like an etcher of delicate glass images. He creates characters that will live in your memory; his plotting is unusual and yet, when you've finished the book, inevitable. Atonement is a wonderful book."
5,The Novel Lives!,"This novel is a work of art. The author knows what he's doing. He's created memorable characters, riveting descriptions, a very good plot, and has thoroughly entertained the reader. Strongly recommended. The novel lives!"
3,"Great writing, but disappointing story","I agree with everyone that this was a great write - a great read. Nevertheless, it also took me about 150 pages in to decide to keep reading instead of putting it down. Then I was hooked. But the ending left me feeling used. That's all."
3,mistitled,"For me, Ian McEwan's book, Atonement, was mistitled. I think a better title would have been ""How to profit from ruining others' lives"". I was prepared to give this book a chance. A slow start, but good use of language, beautifully written, characters to love and hate and what seemed like a good story until the rather grim ending, which made a complete lie of the blurb on the back: ""Briony will have witnessed mysteries, and committed a crime for which she will spend the rest of her life trying to atone"". If doing a bit of wartime nursing and then writing the story of your crime after all the people to whom it might matter have died, first changing the ending so that it will be more acceptable to the reader, then Briony's definition of atonement is something different from the accepted one. ""Atonement: amends or reparation made for an injury or wrong"". I felt cheated by the ending for the time I spent on this book. Guess I don't need to try any more by Ian McEwan!"
2,Hated it,NINE chapters before the 'incident' actually occurs. I almost threw the book out the window.The last half was certainly more interesting than the first but I'm not sure it was worth the aggravation of getting there. Don't waste your money on a hardcover.
1,"frustrating, overdescriptive, disappointing","The first three chapters are so aggravatingly descriptive- from the weather to the fountain to the grounds,etc- that I was often thrown from the initial thought and I found myself skimming through to find some substance to the actual storyline. Parts two and three were easier reads but still a little too drawn out. And of course a disappointing conclusion."
5,Thank You,"A monumentally beautiful novel, it stayed with me for many weeks after I had finished it. Vivid, haunting, incendiary, ""Atonement"" creates a separate world which I felt I had paid a brief visit to. It is difficult to convey in a ""review"" the power of this book, I can only hope that it may help someone make the rewarding decision to also become immersed in this reality. This is not a book one can or should try to rush through, not a page turner, but that should not deter you from a truly great work of art."
2,Overrated,sure wasthere are passages that are very affecting but i've recently readmuch better and more powerful stuff (see anything by richard powers for example)get it from the library
4,Fascinating Characters,"""Atonement"" is an excellent read. I don't read much fiction but my neighborhood book club encouraged me to try this one. I am glad I did. The character development was penetrating."
2,Manipulative and Mean,"The beginning and ending of the book were manipulative and mean. In the end the decent people were trashed. One might say this is reality.The problem is that the beginning was a mass of artifice to create a ""realistic"" ending. The hints of ""a crime"" and the intimations of disaster were drawn out page after page.The middle of the book, telling of the retreat to Dunkirk and the description of Briony as a nurse in the hospital were the redeeming features of the novel.The rest was aggravating and maybe a wee bit pretentious."
4,Unsettling,"I had to put this novel down halfway through, as I found it a bit unsettling. It wouldn't let me stay away for long, though; I'm glad I picked it up again. McEwan's writing gets under your skin -- a good thing, since most novels are forgotten once you put them down. Rich, fleshed-out characters and situations. You spend a great deal of the novel trying to decide if you love or hate the little girl at the center of this story. Engaging and well-crafted."
2,Painful,"This book came highly recommended, so I was excited to read it. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. While it is obvious that McEwan is a creative and artistic writer, his book does nothing to hold one's interest. Pages of unnecessary description and little action make ""Atonement"" a painfully slow read. Fortunately, things pick up a bit in parts II, III and IV (191 pages into the book), but not enough to make reading it worth it."
1,The most boring book ever,"I have tried on at least 4 occasions to read this book, and am still unable to fight through the first 100 pages. Lack of any interisting story, and a less than engaging lead character make this book next to impossible to enjoy. The highlight of the first 100 pages is the young female lead character getting in and out of a fountain. What can I say, but don't waste your money, BORING BORING BORING!"
1,Pure torture is right!,"I agree with the other reviewers who were left wondering why this book has gotten such good reviews. At best it was tedious; at worst simply boring. Silly plot, plodding descriptions of a confusing profusion of characters, none well enough drawn to draw us into their lives--it was difficult, right to the end of the book, to keep them straight. A huge disappointment after all the hype surrounding this novel."
2,"a confused, powerless story","""Atonement"" is, in book-jacket terms, the panoramic story of a lie that profoundly alters the lives of those it touches. It is divided into three parts. The first tells the story of the lie: its background, why it was told, who told it. The last two show the lie's unfolding consequences.For all its careful planning, the book falls short. The first part is excellent: well-written, engaging, full of vibrant characters and an interesting story. The remainder, however, fails to live up to the beginning's promise. The second part of the book is almost devoid of plot, leaving the third part to clumsily resume and conclude the story. By then its emotion is diffused, and the book ends carelessly, trying to be powerful and succeeding only in being amusing and somewhat sad.""Atonement"" is worth reading only for the lush preparation of its first part. The rest of the book in its meandering is - like the story itself - a lesson in waste."
3,Kept expecting it to get better...,Was ultimately very disappointed with this book. The ending left me feeling very unsatisfied especially considering how I had labored through the bulk of the book hoping for an ending to redeem my efforts.
4,A Painter of Pictures,"I have great respect for writers who use words in interesting ways, to paint pictures and tell stories from a unique perspective. Ian McEwan is a master, and I enjoyed Atonement although it did drag a bit. I have also found another writer whose words intrigue me. Were Robert Frost or Claude Monet to employ pen or brush to craft an epic love story, Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin would be the creation. Martin's lyrical prose fuses the drama of The Bridges of Madison County with the emotional weight of The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. McEwan and Martin provide a fine complement, McEwan dealing with heavier material while Martin soars."
1,Overwritten drivel,"I am amazed at the enthusiastic reviews this book has received. It is such a poorly written, poorly conceived story that I was actually laughing out loud as I read it...Could anybody really take either the story or the writing seriously? First, the sentences were baggy and run-on. There were lots (and lots) of adjectives and other verbiage that added nothing and clarified nothing. Then, the character development was not believable: a snitty little tattle-tale grows up to be Florence Nightengale. And even if she did, what would make me care? Does she have any thoughts, depth, emotions, life events that would make her interesting. I can't say because it is neither explicit nor implicit in the book, despite a profusion of unnecesary detail. Lastly, the story line -requiring too much suspended belief for my taste- is far too thin to support 300 odd pages. Where is all the hype and enthusiasm coming from?"
5,A good investment,"The overall state of the book was perfect, though the book had to travel a large distance it had no damage at all!!!The novell itself is allright though very psichological to my liking. You can learn enough of the second world war from a very particular point of view. It's entertaining and very educative.Recomendable."
3,"Great potential in the rich characters, but falls short","It took me awhile to get into the story. By the end of the first part, I was excited to see how the lives of the characters would unfold. Unfortunately, parts II and III jump so far ahead in time that you feel that you no longer know the characters. I felt as though I missed the formative years of the characters I had come to care about in the first part. I would have rather seen McEwan develop Briony's story further during the teen years instead of skipping ahead from age 13 to 18. Overall, I enjoyed it, but it had so much more potential!"
1,bucking the trend,"I was very disappointed in the book and gave up before the end of the first long section. A few moments are well-rendered, but the story is riddled with cliches and overused devices. A sex scene is particularly overwritten, and the writing style is indistinguishable from a cheap romance.my 2 cents"
3,Good writing; irritating book,"This novel started VERY slowly, and unappealinly. I did not like the character Briony even before her actions came into play. I just found her irritating, and the author seems to dwell with fondness on her ""writer-ly"" ways and in general on the craft of writing, which becomes very boring unless you are interested in the writing process rather than in the finished writing and the stories themselves. Twice, I almost decided not to finish reading this book. Finally, I got interested enough to want to find out what would happen. It is well written and ultimately has an interesting story to tell, and we finally do see why the craft of writing is a subject, but it's still an irritating element of the novel, and Briony is irritating. Anyway, I would say it's very good writing, an OK story, but nothing I'd recommend to friends."
2,Where was his editor??,"A talented writer--an awful story.There is no doubt Mr. McEwan can write--some of his prose is magical. But how depressing to read a whole book about how a child's mistake ruins two lives. And how tedious to re-read the detailed events from so many points of view (especially from the mother--how many descriptions of her migraines did we really need?) I wish his editor had been a bit braver and done some cutting. But even if the poor editor had, I fear I still would have found the novel slow and pointlessly sad."
1,"Try As I Might, I Could Not Get Into This Book","I have three words for this one: plodding, plodding and plodding. It's a big seller at the bookstores, and I've *heard* it's great. I asked around and was told to hang tight and just try to keep going. But I kept getting Very Very Sleepy...Three more words: Avoid this book."
3,Tedious,"I hear that this writer is terrific, yet I can't seem to engage in his books. After trying to get into it three times, I basically sped-read through the first half, got to the core issue of the book, and read it from there, while still skimming and skipping. It's very tedious. I'm looking forward to the movie."
2,I hate this book.,"The story itself is interesting, I'll give it that. But by the end, all I wanted to do was hold it open face-down, and shake it until all the unnecessary and superfluous description that took of 75 percent of the book sprinkled out. It was slow to start, but my book club promised that once you get past the first 200 pages, it really picks up. It did pick up, but I was overwhelmingly disappointed and felt absolutely no connection to a single character."
2,so incredibly disappointing,"perhaps the hype surrounding this book was too intense. i waited about 3 months to retrieve this book through the library system and several times i debated buying it just so i could feel part of the critical adulation of this book. boy, i would have been so sad if i had actually paid for this book! i hated all the characters right from the beginning and found all that foreboding to be totally obnoxious. i wish someone could just explain to me the merits of ""atonement."""
2,Contrived and predictable,"What an overrated piece of soap-operatic junk! I can't recall when I was so disappointed in a book. With all the accolades, I was expecting something really special (tho' I should know better by now, as commercial/popular success seems these days to be inversely related to quality). While the prose itself is nice, the entire book hangs on an event that occurs early on and is so contrived and unbelievable, with an outcome that is so predictable, that it was difficult for me to keep reading -- and the only reason I did keep reading was because I kept hoping it would get better, that an intelligent and complex structure would ultimately emerge to justify the contrivance and its predictability -- but alas, it never does. I can't get into specifics without giving away details that shouldn't be revealed to those who still want to read this trash, but if you're looking for an intelligent read with some substance and honesty, DON'T read this book!!"
1,"""Atonement "" was not for me","I can't understand how anyone liked this book, but it's good we have diverse tastes, I guess. I can't add much to previous reviewers who also hated this book, except that I found that even the rare interesting parts were completely unbelievable. Does anyone really believe that a first kiss would lead to first sex moments later, in the library, standing up, and with family nearby no less? I don't think so. And then would Lola and her ""rapist"", who turns out to be her boyfriend, really be in the mood to engage in the act while searching for her lost brothers? I skimmed most everything after the first 30 pages, because I kept expecting it to get better. If it hadn't been a gift from a close friend, I wouldn't have attempted to wade through the drivel at all. I'll rent the DVD eventually when I have a free rental coming up."
2,Don't waste your time.,I cannot remember the last time I was so disappointed with a book. Atonement lacked substance and continuity both with its characters and storyline. I stuck with it until the end and threw it down in disgust. Rarely have I been so disenchanted with a book.
2,Boring...,"Can't wait until my Netflix comes so I can stop reading. I'm hoping the movie is better. So far, just snoreville and seems to be going nowhere."
3,"Good, but not great","What has made this novel so appealing to many readers is clearly lost on me. Alot of it is quite slow, especially the middle section, and I felt no empathy for the characters. Although a great deal of the book is internal monologue (a technique which I usually enjoy and when used well, as with Woolf, can be invaluable), I still ended up feeling that the characters were 2 dimensional. The only exception being possibly Cecila. I didn't hate the character of Briony (I wish I had!), I just didn't care about her or her problems.The end of the novel does contain the punch. The only problem is, for the punch to have any effect, you have to have something invested in the characters. Unfortunately I didn't. Worth a read, but not on the top of my list."
2,Disappointing,"I expected so much more from this book, given the glowing reviews on amazon and in the media. The first part is very well written, especially when describing the house and gardens and the English countryside on a summer day shortly before WWII.However, most of the characters are so annoying, exept Robbie. And how is it that the police believe the story of a 13 year old child, resulting in a man being sent to jail? Surely they would and should investigate somewhat more closely and thoroughly, despite the class difference of the accuser and the accused? I had a hard time swallowing this.The book moves very slowly and the ending, which I unfortunately envisioned as one of the scenarios, was very unsatisfying - but most likely the only possible one. Nobody really atoned, though. I wished I had gotten the book at the library first, as I finally gave it away."
4,Very well done,I am usually a non Fiction reader with Nightmares Echo at the top of my list right now. Well that is until I read Atonement. This book kept me sitting in my seat turning the pages deeply caught up in the storyline. This is really a good book.
1,Help for insomniacs,"I wish I had read the reviews here on Amazon before I picked it up. Had I seen the various comments toward Woolf I would have run away screaming. For those who enjoy overdescriptive multisyllabic ""in the moment"" writings, this book will be a joy. Personally I have already lived through (aka had been forced to) reading Woolf -- and I don't have to anymore. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't understand all the big words, it's just downright annoying to be distracted by them. When I read I want to become so engrossed in the story that I forget I'm reading. With this book, that doesn't happen for me; I'm instead bored with the colorless characters and incessant descriptions of their surroundings. I will probably donate this to the local book drive where some poor kid will have to read it for school.. at least he won't have to pay full price."
2,HUH??,"Ok, I've never read McEwan before...there's a list of his books that I'd like to read, but after reading this one...I don't know, I think I will give him one more chance.This book was awful! It was very boring.First, take the book, some 350 pages & flip through it looking through the words---see many quotes for conversations??That's because there aren't many! That's one problemSecond, start reading if you like, then start to notice that the author uses 20 words to describe something where one work would have sufficed. Then notice that this goes on, on EVERY page!!This book could have been shortened up to probably 150 pages. Easy!I had a very hard time getting through this book. I love to read, and have a nice size vocab, but come on!!!I'll admit the ending was interesting though. Curiosity kept me going to see what would happen"
1,An Overwritten Bore,"On the recommendation of a friend and its literary reputation, I wasted two nights ploughing through the first 85 pages of this book and skimming another 20 before I gave up entirely. It had the ""literary"" quality of endlessly describing the unimportant - details which might be interesting if you cared about any of these people, but I did not. I agree, the first chapter was charming. But nothing after it gave me a single reason to want to waste more time with these characters and their torturous, petty, over-analyzed lives."
1,Atonement by Ian McEwan,"My wife bought the book because it was highly rated. She read it then told me that I had to read it because it was good. It didn't take long before I was bored. 15 pages in I wanted to quit! But I kept reading hoping that it would get better. By page 33 I said to my wife that I wasn't going to read it. She laughed. She said she wanted to see how far I would get, how soon I would quit. I read 2-3 books a week and I have read some boring books but why should I?"
5,"amazing, amazing, amazing!","I have just closed this book, and am still in the trance that it has provided. It is not often that a book completely engrosses me, but this one has. I loved the beautiful narration of this story, the shifting perspective, and finally, the unknown outcome. For fear of giving too much away, I will not discuss the plot, but will say that it has all the appeal of a modern page-turner, combined with the atmosphere of a literary classic. Pick this one up today! I highly recommend this book!"
5,I was so mad at the ending,I LOVED this book. I've never had such a strong emotional reaction to book but the one made me scream in anger and sadness at the end. I don't want to give any more away. Just read it. it's beautifully written it makes you just feel like you know the people in it.
5,Atonement,"A fantastic book. It was a little bit slow going at first; I kept waiting for something to happen. Once it did, the book was fantastic. I'm really glad I bought this."
4,Nice Historical Fiction,I gave this book four stars because the story was well written and moving. It did not receive five stars because this is not a book that I would read again and again to reunite with the characters as they go through their conflicts. I would recommend this book for individuals who enjoy dramatic period pieces.
1,One of the most boring reads ever,In the right hands this story could have been a gripping tale. Instead Mr. McKewan douses the plot in unnecessary prose to the point I didn't care about the characters or the story. I just wanted to scream...get to the point already! When he finally does its so annoyingly unsatisfying I wanted my time and money back. Guess he wanted the reader to write the book for him. Terrible.
1,Atonement,Very hard to follow and very hard to keep interested. One of the worst books I have read so far.
2,booooooooring!,"I don't know why I bought this book when I didn't like Amsterdam either. I guess I'm just not the Ian McEwan type. The characters do not engage me, the ""details"" feel like filler. I basically skimmed the book to see how things turned out for the main characters & was done."
2,Not As Good as everyone makes it out to be,"The book is terribly boring. I had heard how amazing it was, and was extremely disappointed when I was reading it. Which is another thing, it took me so long to get through this book, I could have been reading something better. The book had its moments, but it needed more from Cecilia's point of view. She was hardly ever mentioned after the first part! I'm sure some people will enjoy this, but I bet the movie is a lot better, don't bother reading the book, just go see the movie, at least then you'll get to enjoy James McAvoy."
5,language barrier,"like so many other fine foreign novels, the language barrier became something that's very difficult to overcome. Even brilliant translation would not do the job."
1,"""Mrs. Dalloway"" on Speed",This book held my attention for the first few pages and then was so incredibly boring that I brought it back to the library. I'm glad I didn't buy it because it would have been a waste of my money.What didn't I like about it?The fact that it just kept repeating itself and prattling on ad nauseum.Not my cuppa tea.
1,very disappointing,"This book was a huge disappointment....I had to struggle to finish it...we read it for Book Club and thought it was dreadful.The climax of the book is in the first couple of chapters, very little character development....The story is boring and cold...I would not recommend this book...."
1,A pathetic excuse for literature,"This book completely blew me away with the fact that the main charactor never ever uses the word tractor. This was about the only thing I enjoyed in the book. As a professor of micrefonology I was shocked at the way roosters are portrayed in this book.In short, I would reccomend this book to anyone who loves pumpkin pie.Thank you,Professor Horace Montgomery"
3,Meandering but not lyrical--still a good book,"I found the writing style of McEwan to be meandering without being especially lyrical. There were some details that didn't need to be there, or at least not as drawn out as they were. Still, though, this is a good book in terms of looking at how writing and our imaginations affect our real lives. McEwan's description of how young Briony totally misunderstands the adult world around her is masterful, and makes her somewhat sympathetic, despite the terrible thing she has done. The ending is also something of a surprise, which makes the book worth sticking out to the end. I'd really give this 3-1/2 stars if I could, but I can't, so three stars it is. Still worth your time, though."
5,"Fine Novel On Guilt, Atonement and Absolution","Quite simply this is the finest novel from Ian McEwan that I've read, replete with much of his eloquent, poetic prose. Although one may not be initially compelled by the characters, most notably the protagonist Briony Tallis, the author creates a captivating, mesmerizing look at English country life near the eve of World War II. And then he skips ahead a few years, immersing us in the bloody aftermath of the fall of France and the British retreat from Dunkirk, where he picks up anew the tangled web of intrigue surrounding the lives of Briony, her older sister Cecilia and their neighbor Robbie Turner. Some may question the novel's brief epitaph-like ending, towards the close of the 20th Century, but here the author dwells on the choices - or lack thereof - made by his protagonist. Without divulging more details of the plot, this splendid novel is a powerful contemporary exploration of guilt, atonement and absolution; one which shouldn't be overlooked."
3,"At times a ""tough"" read but worth it...",This is not the type of book that I found so gripping that I could read it while my wife watched television. It truly takes concentration to follow the vast descriptions of characters and places. But it's certainly worth the time. The author paints a horrific picture of what happens when a child's fantasy world bleeds into reality and leads to decisions that have tremendous consequences. My only critique is that the last 1/4th of the book skips quickly from life phase to life phase and then claims not to have told the entire truth.
4,A beautiful book,"This is a lovely story that does suffer from a certain preciousness. The characters and situations may not always ring true, but I still found myself caring immensely about them. The first and third parts stand out from the middle, which seems a bit convoluted and muddled."
4,The most memorable book I read in 2003,"Many reviewers seem to have found the novel to be plodding and contrived, but for me, it was a beautiful, compelling read. I didn't find part I to be slow at all. I was hooked from the start. The only part where my attention wandered somewhat was during part II, with all the war descriptions. But I see the purpose of that whole section, now that I've finished the novel.The last two pages were heartbreaking."
4,An emotionally charged novel,"It took me a while to get into this book because McEwan's prose is rich (and at times heavy) delving into his character's conscious experiences moment by moment. I thought the whole story was going to be set in the opening scene in the country house, but then things take a turn when Briony witnesses a sexual exchange between Ceila and Robbie. From her childish viewpoint, she does not realise the huge consequences of what she does afterwards, which is tragic. The fate of the couple is heart-wrenching and stayed with me for days after finishing this book. I'm glad I haven't seen the film, it might have tainted my reading experience. Highly recommended, but McEwan's writing style gets a little getting used to."
4,Much better than the movie,"Atonement is a beautifully written novel that operates on many levels. First and foremost it does NOT operate well as an action novel. The action is very slow and staged. If you like a good action-packed book, this one is not for you. However, if you like a nuanced novel with psychological insights and intrigue, you will probably really appreciate Atonement. It is written in four very different and distinct styles which depend on the narrator and time period portrayed. Sometimes the descriptive passages get a bit overwrought, especially in the first (and longest) section, which is written in the words of a precocious teen aged girl. These passages make the first part drag a bit, but they are not intolerable."
2,Couldn't wait till the end,"It sounded like a good book when I bought it, but didn't enjoy it.It seems that most people really love this book, but I hated it. I only give it two stars because various passages of the book were interesting. I enjoyed those few pieces but as a whole I wanted to toss it in the trash. The book seemed to drag on and on.I was not able to care about any of the characters, I found them all self absorbed and immature. I could neither really love or hate them, they seemed too fake to me. Without the story invoking feeling I couldn't get into it."
4,Another Win From Ian McEwan,"This is a good novel. Some UK reviewers have called it an epic and a masterpiece. It is neither. Although long for a McEwan novel, 351 pages does not an epic make. And McEwan's loyal readers (including this one) are still waiting for the masterpiece he will one day, no doubt, achieve. ""Atonement"" works on many levels: Here we have the annoying British class system, a stunning depiction of the BEF's retreat to Dunkirk and images of London during the Blitz. The stitching that holds it all together is betrayal and the quest for atonement thereafter. This novel should be read."
2,Heavy handed and thin,"After ploughing through Atonement for a book group, I was very disappointed. The writing is heavy handed, the character development is virtually nonexistent, many of the key characters disappear after the ""crime"", and the plot development is thin. It would have made an interesting short story, but McEwan fills up page after page with irrelevant war experiences of two of the characters that have nothing to do with the plot of the book and stretches an interesting premise into an empty novel. Atonement for the main character, Briony, is irrelevant since the only two characters who can give her forgiveness, we find out in the last pages, are dead. Just as the story dwells endlessly inside of the head of immature, fantasy prone, histrionic Briony--her perceived atonement is just as fantastical. This book is much ado about nothing. I'm surprised McEwan got such good press. Perhaps it's because he is a Booker prize winner for a prior work."
5,What a great book club selection...,"On several different levels, ""Atonement"" is a beautiful, memorable, and thoroughly engrossing novel. All of us who enjoy serious fiction know at some level that plot and characters are the author's creation, the result of a series of deliberate choices. Here, though, Ian McEwan makes that reality a key element in the novel itself. The miracle is that, for me at least, this self-conscious dimension in no way interfered with my being totally engaged by the story he tells. But it would make for fantastic book-club discussion!!"
4,Much better in audio,I purchased the book and got stuck after about 30 pages. I just couldn't pick it up again. Then I came upon the audio tapes. I am thoroughly enjoying listening to the tapes. The criticism that descriptions are long and tedious are much easier to deal with when listerning rather than reading. The audio version is great and much easier to digest and expeience. I am touched by the story and encourage you to get the audio version.
2,not time well spent,this book deals with noble sentiments in a noble way..and i dearly wanted to enjoy it ..much like i want kids to give up their bus seats for old people .but the mundane war time detail just bored me..the characters bored me especially bryony /mcewan who seem to mistake art for clever rambling sentence structure and forget that a novel and a dairy are different things ..and that sometimes people just want to be entertained ...
3,Masterpiece is too strong a word,"This book has been hailed as a masterpiece but I found it a bit disappointing. Sometimes I wish the 'hype machine' would go away ... I found the first part of the novel to be too long, a lot of build up that I don't think was necessary. The story itself is a good one and does leave one pondering truth and lies and how our actions affect others ..."
2,boring,"This book put me to sleep. I like the plot, but the book was too wordy. I did not like the way everything is overly described. I am an avid reader and have a very vivid imagination; I do not need all those unnecessary sentences to get me hooked on the book. I found myself skipping full paragraphs to avoid all the unnecessary details and get to the good stuff. After reading like this, for half the book I finally gave up and put the book down for good. I am looking forward to going to the theater and watching the film, hopefully it doesn't make me sleepy too"
4,Fine story,"Reading this book, you have immediate sense of its immense filmic potential; McEwan is an extraordinary story teller and a finessed stylist - his characters are multi-dimensional and his morality story is rich in its complexity.I did find myself distracted for the first couple of chapters, because the action takes a while to unravel and the pacing is more along the lines of Austen: English class distinction dominates. When the action takes a violent turn, the novel really begins: the time period shifts to the war and its attendant travesty, concluding with a final change of voice - atonement."
3,So Disappointing . . .,"Enduring Love was my first McEwan read, followed by Amsterdam. I held my breath for the release of Atonement, only to be sorely disappointed. During the very slow start I found stock characters from 1930s literature and very little dialogue or background which tied the characters together. I couldn't make it past the first 100 pages before deciding that it wasn't worth any more valuable reading time.I must admit that I didn't do a close reading - I didn't look for the metaphors or analyze the dialogue for its significance to the development of the characters. However, I didn't find it necessary to search for these clues when reading Enduring Love and Amsterdam, hence my disappointment.I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this novel for pleasure reading. However, I concede that it may be worthy of study."
3,Two Books In One ?,"Part One of the tale is beautifully written, in an old-fashioned Britannic way, and does a good job of setting up a situation which the reader might hope will lead to the ""atonement"" promised by the title. Part Two, unfortunately, fails utterly to deliver; the ""atonement"" is an unsatisfying copout. It's hard to justify the many rave reviews this book has garnered."
2,Slow start,"Hang in there, it takes about 75 pages until it starts to get readable. Does make an interesting book club book. Anxious to see the movie to understand how this was a best seller."
2,So boring!,I really thought this book was extremely boring. Moved way too slowly and there was honestly nothing in this book that made me WANT to finish it. I would not recommend this book unless you need something to help put you to sleep every night.
3,"""it has no backbone.""","Young Briony, with an overactive fantasy and novelist soul, witnesses the flirtation between her sister, Celia, and the son of a servant, Robbie. When her cousin is raped, Briony accuses Robbie, which sends him to prison. During WWII, Celia--who has left the family--and Briony--guilt ridden by her crime--become nurses while Robbie fights in France. The book has a very lovely Virginia Wolf style to it (which I recognized before the book told me so), with the stream of consciousness, emotions, and perceptions of the characters flowing together during the momentous days. The meta-book stuff (Briony writing the book and changing the events to suit her imagination and forgive her crime) isn't as grating as I usually find that sort of thing. No, my main complaint is just how utterly boring the book is. The story is fascinating and full of potential. But it takes forever to tell. In the words of Briony's rejection letter, ""it has no backbone"". Grade: B-"
3,"Yak, Yak, YAK.....","....Talk, talk, talk.This should have been written as a short story or three part magizine piece. While the premise is interesting, I found that it lacked suspense and true bite. I know all the critics are raving about but I don't see it.I do not even understand how the story advanced as far as it did. What kind of defense attorney did this guy hire? Briony should have ended up in prison, but the author has a quick fix for that.The ending is very pat and so unsatisfying.If you like ""wordy"", you get it. Otherwise, pass on this and move on to other books."
1,frustration thy name is atonement,"If this book's a masterpiece, I gotta start writing more.Words, words, words. Then more words. (Did McEwan never read Elements of Style? Omit Needless Words?) There are so many paragraphs here -- so many pages -- that writers like Graham Swift and William Boyd could have dashed off with a single line, losing nothing. For example, THREE PAGES to dissect Cecilia's choice of a dress for the evening??? And in those pages, false lines abound, like -- ""...and though one bore wine stains and another a burn hole from her first cigarette..."" Ugh! (How about ""...and though one bore wine stains and another a burn hole from a cigarette (her first!) ...""?)I liked both Amsterdam and The Innocent very much. Wonderful, clean, direct writing, with interesting engaging characters. Before McEwan starts his next book, I suggest he reads less Jane Austen, and more Elmore Leonard."
2,"Slow starter, but worth the read","This is a much hyped book that I was eagerly waiting for. I even pre-ordered it based on various TV accolades. Well, the first 50 pages were very difficult to plow through, but then it picked up and after setting it aside twice, I finished it.It's no Jane Eyre, or even the fast moving Tom Clancy, but worth the money and the read."
1,I can't believe this got a good review!,"This book started out well but ended in a thud of nothingness. The ending made no sense but the book fell out of favor about half-way through. I suspect people say they love Atonement solely to make people think they read ""serious"" fiction. A waste of valuable time."
4,"Smart, interesting, but maybe not his best work","I loved each section of this book (there were three) but found the end a little too gimmicky for my taste. It didn't help that I guessed it. On the other hand, the writing is quite splendid, and at times very moving. He's really a fantastic writer, and I'll buy his next book and his next. If you wonder what I think his best is, it's ""Enduring Love."" From title to last word, it it absolutely perfection."
4,"Beautiful, but . . . .","Absolutely beautiful, but . . . This book is elegantly written. Unfortunately, most of us read books today for the story, or at least the pace of story development. Not a criticism but a fact of life in today's world in which the various forms of video entertainment make plowing through a book seem 'slow'. There is no reward here for the reader seeking a fast paced thriller. But if you chew on your prose and enjoy skillfully phrased and artistic prose, as I do, then you will love this work of art. Frankly, McEwan intimidates me at times with his mastery of the language. Unfortunately, his story will appeal to a limited readership. Frankly, if you are in the club, ain't it grand. To the rest, maybe you don't know what you are missing."
1,Slow and Dull,"I've made it to page 80 but am giving up. I only stuck with the book this long because I kept thinking it was going to get better, based on the 3 pages of rave reviews on the first few pages. But, it's just too slow and dull for me and I have too many other good books to read. I am mystified how 500+ people have given this book 5 stars?"
3,Atonement,"Our book club of six discussed ATONEMENT after 5 of us read it and one saw the movie. 3 of us agreed that it was a little difficult to follow because of there being so many words; and it was a novel within a novel. I should have read more detailed reviews of the novel before reading it. We were trying to describe this type of literature among today's writings. ""Wordy descriptions and loose connections"" is what I concluded after our discussion. Even Part II, which moves better that Part I presumes connections that one misses unless one is wide awake! This is not a book to read when one is sleepy!"
1,Pointless story,"I just finished reading this book and if I didn't have to read it for my book club, I never would have read to the end. Very boring, tedious and too much detail. I literally skipped 30-40 pages when Robbie was fighting in the war. I never felt like I got to know the characters. We know Briony commits a terrible crime and it's supposed to change her life. But the author doesn't show us how her life was changed. He jumps from when she's 18 to the age of 77 and we don't know how she lived her life in between. I was a bit angry as I read the story because I felt I was wasting my time. To me, the story was pointless and when I finished, I wondered, who cares?"
1,Boring and unengaging,"I read this for a book club where a number of the other members had described this as one of their absolute favorite books ever, so I had high hopes. It became an arduous and unrewarding slog through pedantic, verbose descriptions of landscapes and characters. I never figured out why I should care for even one second about any of the people in the story, so completely unsympathetic were they. As a side note, I saw the movie after a friend said it was better than the book, but I found it equally uninteresting."
2,Atone for My Wasted Time,"Perhaps I'm the wrong kind of reader for this kind of book. I'm not the action-thriller type at all, but this book fails to move. Instead it is full of over-long descriptions of nothing. It takes nearly 200 pages for anything to happen. I enjoy 'getting into' characters, but after this much introduction, I should care about them. I didn't know the characters & I didn't care about them. I found I could quickly scan many pages and not miss a thing. (I almost never do so.) One thing finally happens, which is the unresolved theme of the rest of the book. By the time it's resolved (or rather, NOT resolved) I didn't care any more. The only interesting part was 50 pages in the middle describing the horrors of Dunkirk during WW II.I know this got all kinds of awards, but I'm sorry - no plaudits from me."
2,Very slow read,This was my first Ian McEwan book and it was such a slow read for me. Ian describes EVERYTHING in too much detail for my taste. I was impatient to get on with the story. I realize this descriptiveness is what appeals to others. I wouldn't recommend this book.
2,"Overwrought, Overdone, Overkill","Not on my best-seller list!I really had to trudge through the first 50-80 pages to gain a sense of direction. Too much time and attention was devoted to unncessary scenery and minutiae at the characters' expense. Only from the book jacket did I get a real grasp of the time frame for the story. Was the over-wrought description of the vase really necessary? Did it lend anything to the story? I just didn't find the characters well-developed -- given the lack of dialogue and interaction.Part II felt very much like a reincarnation of ""Birdsong"" by Sebastian Faulks.The book's only saving grace was the juxtaposition of the final section, and the questions left to ponder. Hardly enough, in my humble estimation, to warrant the first 150 pages."
1,Atonement,"What a frustrating, pretentious book! McEwan puts together a nineteenth century novel and then ""cleverly"" refuses to end it, because the godlike author/narrator is unable to do so. A tired concept and a rip-off. Nothing Pirandello didn't do a whole lot better a long time ago."
2,disappointing...,"I found this book very disappointing considering its place on various bestseller lists. It takes a very long time to get where it's going and the language does not warrant the wait; neither do the characters. The ""unreliable narrator"" may be a fictional fad or may be here to stay but this one was a waste of my time. And I really disliike books that contort themselves in the last few pages."
2,O.K.,"I thoroughly enjoyed the setting and time period of the characters in this book; however, I found the plot and conclusion to be predictable. The writing is beautiful but the book is really quite boring."
1,Abandon all Hope ye who Enter Here,"In all my life, I have only ever been unable to finish two books. Atonement is the second. After having such high hopes from other reviewers and friends, I made it halfway into this book - reaching, at last, the crime - before having to toss the book aside. It is cliche, none of the characters are remotely likable, or even bearable, and the writing is over-detailed to the point that it makes a reader struggle to remember what is actually happening in the story. It is with great regret that I am forced to add another book to my ""Unbearable"" list, and hope that no more innocents are trapped into reading Atonement."
2,"Slow, slow, slow","I was expecting this to be an exciting, interesting book and I stalled at 3/4's of the way through because it still hadn't gotten any momemtum or reached the conflict stage. I will probably finish it, but only when I have nothing else to read."
4,Atonement review,"Excellent descriptive detail of a young girl's imaginative, creative world in England during the 1930-40's. So much detail (and little story line) may seem a bit slow-going for some readers."
2,I don't know how to love it,"I rented this movie upon hearing the famous title song and ""I Dont Know How To Love Him"". But what I found instead was something that looked like some hippies went out to the desert to sing. Now, I usually understand even the most complex of movies. But this one perplexed me. I didn't understand why after he was crucified, everyone packed up, in normal clothes as if everything was okay and they had just come to act out a part and crucify Him. That is the only part I didn't understand. And King Herod's hats made me kinda sick or some reason."
3,Antichrist Superstar,The whole point of Marilyn Manson parodying this on the 1996 album Antichrist Superstar was so that they wouldn't gloat over it. This Andrew Llyod Webber version is the one everyone used to know. I was baptized and confirmed.
1,Weak & Weird,This performance was weak and the set ups weird compared to the more recent Broadway and West End stage productions. This movie version is no substitute or even a good introduction to what became a fantastic show.
3,Dated,"The music is still great, but this movie is way too dated. However, another Ted Neeley would need to be found as I considered him the ultimate Jesus of a musical. He's made a great career of the role though his voice was going the last time I saw him, and even though this version was not as dated, the producers, by that time, had added some gimics that were just plain silly. Mr. Neeley was still an very good actor and on stage he age didn't show.With all the remakes of Broadway shows, why do the 'powers that be' keep passing on this one. It's one of Lloyd Webber's better musical and far better than 'God Spell', I'm hoping someone will either put it back on the stage or re-make it as a movie, or both."
3,DATED but TUNEFUL,"For some reason, we were bombarded with all kinds of rock/pop interpretations of the Bible and of Jesus' life story in the early 70s. This one, which definitely rocked my socks then, seems the most dated of all of them -- the images of hippies pulling into the Holy Land in a beat up bus look like a warped acid trip; however, some of the musical numbers are still very effective, and I really enjoy Yvonne Elliman as Magdelene. Most of the other performances are way over the top, and Ted Neeley is whiny and unappealing as Jesus."
2,Not Ian Gillan,"I grew up listening to my parents copy of the JCS soundtrack on vinyl and was blown away by the power of Ian Gillan's vocal performance .Being too young to have seen him on stage all I had was this LP .I finally saw the DVD of the film version and can honestly say that the ""Jesus"" in the film is no match for what comes across on the original soundtrack .His vocals seem muted in points and is hard to understand at times(thankfully there are captions).He seems too wimpy to be the Son of God.He has no kind of presence ,almost ghost-like . The Judas part is very well done .He comes across with a lot of emotion in his parts .Not horrible but not Ian Gillan"
4,Not a bad movie,"Ok, lets get one thing straight: this movie was NOT, I repeat Not made to convert people to Christianity. It is for entertainment purposes only. Overall, this version has it's highs and lows, but so does every other movie out there. Ted Neeley is a wimpy looking Jesus. I'm sorry but it's true. Carl Anderson is a good Judas. AndYvonne Elliman does an OK Mary. My favorite person is Bob Bingham who plays Ciaphas. He, in my personal opinion, is the 2nd best Ciaphas (right after to Gary Martin in the 20th Anniversary Recording). So, in conclusion, if you want to strengthen your spiritual beliefs, you're better off buying ""The Passion of the Christ"", which is basically a snuff film. But, if you want good music, anda few laughs, then this movie is for you"
5,Jesus Christ Superstar,Awesome original cast exactly as I remember it even better as you can pause and review parts I always corious about.
5,A very good film from a very good time.,Just I good re-minder of Jesus without the relegen. I just like the film. Also the time of making the film was so much better than now.
4,Great Movie!,"I am a devote Christian and I think that this is an excellent movie. Although this movie presents ideas which I believe to be false, such is not the point of the film. The film presents the life of Christ from a secular perspective through the eyes of Judas and other political figures in Jerusalem. I believe that such a point of view presents great insights into what motivated good men to do wrong, and we can learn a lot from that.Besides that, the music and choreography are absolutely incredible, and therefore it is a must see!"
2,He is no Ian Gillian,"I am not a big fan of this movie because the director did something that was not original. He took a production dated in ancient times and tried to update to today's world. Boring and unimaginative.Further, Ted Nealey...well, let's just say he is not Ian Gillian. To the ""die hard"" JC Superstar fans, buy the CD with the original cast. It will blow you away. Just the emotion in the singing (which isn't in the movie) will bring you to tears.By the way, does a video exist with Ian Gillian in it?"
5,JCS Rocks,"I see some people complaining about the ending because Jesus died and the resurrection was not shown.There is a problem with the people complaining. They obviously have no read their Bibles nor do they understand this movie.The movie is from the viewpoint of Judas. Yes, that Judas - the one that was a disciple and betrayed Jesus.Judas died before Christ was resurrected, so why would he see that happen?The movie is great. Remember that it is from Judas's viewpoint, and then watch the movie, remember the things that Judas saw - not what you want to be told, not what you want to see, what it seems Judas saw!"
3,ok movie,The movie arrived sooner than expected. Watched it with my teenage daughter. It is different. glad I can say now that I have seen it probably will not watch it again .
5,JCSuperstar,"Wore out my video of this movie,so my sister suggested Amazon.com. Found it right away and the Special Edition is awesome!!!"
1,Terrible Quality,"I bought ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" from this individual bacause of the high number of 5 star ratings. I should have ignored that because this movie was scratched up terribly. Even after cleaning,the picture quality was horrible. Don't be fooled by the high ratings because you will be sorely disappointed."
1,"Great movie , poor quality copy","This appears to be a cheap burned copy quality, skips entire sections of the movie, not original manufacture, I would have done as well buying on the street."
3,"Jesus Christ, Superstar","Jesus Christ Superstar (Special Edition)I bought this with trepidation given its seeming potential for blasphemous treatment of a sacred topic. Nonetheless, though the story is slightly off-center, it was not offensive and some parts are even humorous in a non-blasphemous manner."
4,Very interesting movie.,"I was given the chance to see this movie yesterday, I found nothing fancy about it but, it is a nice well produced and acted film."
4,Jewison (as usual) stays true to the stage vision,"With Jesus Christ Superstar,Norman Jewison proves that ""Yes it is possible to take a show from the stage to the screen and stay true to the original vision that made that show what it was.a good example of the opposite would be Alan Parker's verson of ""Evita""(he made Eva Peron look like a girlscout!) This movie will not won't be everybodys cup of tea.Firstly the main thing to remember is this is not the Gospel according to Luke,Matthew,or John.It's the Gospel according to Judus so don't expect to see Jesus as we as christians have(if he did do you think he would have betrayed him?) Secondly,it's opera with libretto,no talking just singing .But what singing!!! the vocals in this are killer,and the powerful music of Andrew Lloyd-Webber makes for a great movie!!!"
2,Disappointing sound quality,"First off, I love the music, and once owned the LP version of the soundtrack. But for whatever reason, the soundtrack on the DVD is so quiet that I had to turn the volume WAY UP just to hear it. What gives? Are they saving ""bits"" for some other recording? If the original movie was this ""quiet"", why couldn't they boost the sound level? This isn't me or my DVD player. All my other movies play ""normally"".For this reason I CANNOT recommend that you buy this DVD. You will be sorely disappointed by the sound quality."
5,J.C. Superstar - video,"Excellent depiction of the story of Jesus Christ's road to salvation showing the path Judas made to allow salvation for all. The video was filmed in Israel making the true to life elements jump out to the viewers and related to ""modern"" day challenges.Particularly enjoyed the dialogue between the director and Ted Neely describing the events and challenges associated with the filming!"
5,My favorite musical hands down...,"Love it...play it regularly...have the sound track...bought extra DVD to give as present. Love the cast, the memories and the seriousness of it all. Beautifully done, beautifully written and well acted.Jesus Christ Superstar.Encore!"
2,it was o.k.,"Folowing the end of the movie, i had mixed feelings.Iliked the way Ted Neely and Carl Anderson played there parts.I didn't like the way everybody else played.Everybody sang great though.I didn't think Andrew Loyld Webber set it up.Al the bad guys had guns in every scene.It also was not likewhat they had in the bible.I can see why the Christians were outraged.It was pure dissen GOD.The Non Christians are a different storie.they were mad because it was about jesus. No one Was making them watch it.So in my opinion they need to shut up and not watch it.I mean come on ,the title isJesus Christ Superstar.Some of the people though were mad because it was a ' rock' opera.They thought electric guitars and base drums shouldn't be in there. So thats what I thought about the movie.(...)"
1,Dissapointed...,I was shocked when I saw this film.. I found out recently that there was a film made for Jesus Christ Superstar that was made a while ago.. and being a huge Andrew Lloyd Weber fan I decided to see if this was any good.. and to my surprise it wasn't good. I basically fast forwarded through most of it.. I lost interest very quickly.. I thought it was very boring.. ALthough I love the work of Andrew Lloyd Weber .. This movie just slapped him in the face.. it was horribly made.. the scenes didn't match up.. there was hardly a story line to follow.. the story was harder to follow than Weber's musical Cats which basically had no storyline but was a lot more interesting than this butchered musical.. The vocals were quite impressive though.. And I did enjoy the rock/roll songs very much.. but there were hardly any to enjoy... This has got to be a huge dissapointment to all his fans
5,The Debate Rages...,"...on and on in my house. Which is better...the Broadway version or the Hollywood version? This Unitarian Universalist family is firmly divided. He likes Ian I like Ted. We both agree that Carl rules. More importantly, we're turning on a whole new generation to this excellent movie and soundtrack with my 6 and 10 year old kids singing snippets around the house and asking questions about faith."
5,Relate...,this vidio Helps the modern person relate to who Jesus was and how Jesus felt. I would recomend this vidio to anyone at all.
5,"Unique, Wonderful Musical",JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR has wonderful music and the movie made from it is pretty close to perfect. Shot creatively on location in the Middle East and filled with expertly rendered visual symbolism this musical has a unique take on the last days of probably the most influential person to ever live. No matter what one's spiritual beliefs JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR can give the open minded viewer new insights into a life that changed the world.
3,Not as described.,The description for audio says DTS. It does not have DTS. It has only 2.0 stereo. You can read this on the photo of the back of box.
5,Super!,"I had not seen this for a long time before tonight and was so moved by Jewison's screen direction. What a great musical, great music, great movie. Indeed, this has to be the best musical screenplay of all time. Wonderful. I am still moved an hour later, and believe me, I am a lapsed Catholic. It has nothing to do with faith or lack therof but everything to do with message, music and drama. Wonderful."
5,interesting music,"I saw this movie at the theater when it originally came out. I thought it would be interesting for my boys to watch. (ages 16 & 22) They both loved the music and commented on the fact that this was the longest music video they had ever seen! Younger viewers would probably find this too long and the strict christian community ""slightly"" sacrilegious; but if you view this as just entertainment, our family loved it."
5,Jesus as a man,"I watch this movie every year during the season of Lent and never grow tired of it. I inevitably end up crying as Ted Neeley's portrayal of Jesus as an ordinary man with an extrordinary fate is so powerful. It reminds me of the fear and suffering he endured for us. I love the way Norman Jewison set the movie in the desert. Ted Neeley, Carl Anderson and Yvonne Elliman's voices are incredibly well-suited to their parts. And the music is just plain awesome. I just don't get people who don't get this movie. It is a gem!"
5,Amazing!,"There are no bad guys in this version of the story. Everyone is doing what they think they must, and you really feel for all of them. As ""anglicized"" Jesus's go, Ted Neely gives a thoroughly believable performance of the most amazing man in history. Ignore the modern-day props, and focus instead on the words and especially the emotions of the actors, and you will be as amazed as I was. I've seen it several times now, and I am touched by it each time."
5,Fast international delivery and perfect conditions,"I ordered this product internationally, from Uruguay, and the standard delivery took a lot less than the estimated time frame.Package arrived in perfect conditions, item inside in its original packaging and in perfect condition.I recommend this supplier and will definetely buy from it again.thanks"
4,One of the best musicals ever.....,"If you like musicals and can appreciate ""NEW"" (70's) trends, then you should like this movie. The music is entrancing and the scenery spectacular. Keep in mind that this is not a traditional biblical movie, but a 70's interpretation, full of the power and force that drove the early part of the decade. Turn down the lights and crank up the sound for an enjoyable movie."
5,bordering on the subliminal,"An amazing adaptation of an amazing musical. Carl Anderson (Judas Iscariot) carries the show, displaying attacking 'hardedge' but soulful lyrics..... could not have been done any better!another one for Mr Jewison (thomas crown-the best).thank youwayne"
1,worthless,"I loved the original recording of Superstar. I loved the stage version that I saw as a teen. This is easily the weakest performance of this show that I'd ever seen. As a composer I can say that, were I Andrew Lloyd Webber, I would disown this travesty. Pity that my rating has to even give it one star"
3,3 Stars and I'll tell you why:,"I wasn't alive during the hippie age. It was interesting to watch this and see how they dressed, acted, and thought. I think their aim was more artistical than it was religious.From a religious standpoint, I hated that they did not show His ressurection, because that is the basis of the Chrisitan belief. That is like our focal point.Get this movie for an artistical show, but not for spiritual replenishment."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A dated and irrelevant rock opera version of the end of Jesus's life, Jesus Christ Superstar features a couple of catchy tunes but mainly just feels long and loud."
1,ARE YOU PEOPLE NUTS?,"what kind of movie on the life of Christ ends with Jesus dead on the cross? where's the resurrection? isnt that the point? if Christ didnt rise from death then were all dead in our sins. are any of the people who reviewed this movie Christians? i read the 1 star reviews and no one even mentioned this! they were mostly complaining about the quality of the sound track! this movie is garbage. Mary Magdalen said it right when she sang ""he's just a man, he's just a man"". my Jesus is'nt just a man. he's God in the flesh. he was crucified for our sins and on the third day rose from the dead. victorious over death. without the resurrection Jesus is just a man and can't save himself let alone anyone else! how so called Christian people can so easily be fooled is mind boggling! its like the bible says ""many are called, few are chosen""."
5,"Keen on Where and How, Very Hot on Why","Fresh off another annual Easter viewing of the movie, I'm not sure I can add much to previous reviews except to say that after twenty-plus viewings, the film never fails to mesmerize. Norman Jewison's direction is beautiful and artful. I love getting the sense of some seriously committed hippies making a pilgrimage to Israel and, after dismounting a Partridge Family-esque bus, proceeding to put on a tremendous show with a bare-bones budget. Dated? How about impeccable in spirit, in the way it captures an era and its sensibilities?"
3,A humanistic portrayal of the life of Jesus,"If you are looking for something Christian or inspirational, this musical is not really intended to be either. If you are not a Christian and you like musicals, you may enjoy it. But if you are a Christian you will probably not like this portrayal of Jesus. Webber and Rice take the life of Jesus and turn it into an account of an influential and misunderstood human being who is not and doesn't claim to be anything other than just plain human. Jesus' words as recorded in the gospels are altered and radically added to, with the obvious goal of showing that Jesus did not consider himself to be either the Hebrew Messiah or the Son of God. (This intent may not be obvious by watching it, but a reading of the libretto makes it clear). His actions and words are much more 'human' than was portrayed in the gospels. And the actions and words of his apostles are also changed from the gospel accounts, largely for the worse as far as their moral character is concerned."
1,why no bluray release,Why would the anniversary edition not be available in bluray - this most certainly is a very big disappointment and poor marketing to say the least.
5,Jesus Christ Superstar DVD,It was a great buy. I was suprised at the quality considering the age of the movie.
1,Unreadable,"My DVD does not read 'Jesus Christ Superstar' which I bought from you, so I can not give an opinion...I remember though the picture and I regret this misfortune.By the way, you sent ùe two copies of this DVD, and I sent one back (which you credited me) Perhaps I sent the wrong one Back ?Sincerely, Cornélis."
2,It was okay,"I really did not see anything special with this film. THe people that played Judas and Mary were excellent wonderful voices and were fun to watch, but other than that the movie was jsut alright. The other singing voices were downright annoying (the people that played Jesus and one of the high priest...their voices were painful to hear... I thought my windows might break)"
5,An Epic done the right way,"This is an epic of the last week of Jesus's life, done as if it were just one long rock video. The actors, Ted Neely, et al. were absolutely stunning. Their respective performances were breath-taking, and their ability to fit together to form the relationships in ancient Israel were outstanding. I was truly impressed. The movie was interesting, and not the normal religios epic that say Jesus of Nazerath or King of Kings are, but it can stand in its own category titled simply, wonderful. This movie is worth the purchase. The music and story are touching, and the sets are unusual, and the whole movie is very artisically done. I enjoyed it, and I hope you will also."
4,Gratos recuerdos ...,"Cuando la pelicula fue exibida no tenia edad para poder entrar a un teatro a verla. Ahora que por fin la vi ... sabia que era lo que es. La musica es muy buena. El sonido no es espectacular pero si es bastante bueno, es de esperarse de una vieja pelicula. La recomiendo para los creyentes y amantes del rock."
4,Definitely worth seeing,"Fabulous production of the Passion of Jesus. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that at first, I thought Ted Neeley was a little weak as Jesus. I also wasn't thrilled w/Yvonne Elliman's not-so-stellar singing voice (she slides all around the notes!) But as with many other films, repeated viewings have swayed my opinion. I now really enjoy Neeley's vocal delivery and presence (and I overlook weird little things like his shuffling walk). Carl Anderson as Judas is EXCELLENT, as is the ensemble of dancers. The 1970's production is a little dated, but the flare pants and phrases like ""What's the buzz?"" now only seem to add to its kitchy charm. Like coffee and beer, this one is an acquired taste - but once acquired, you'll love it!! Great music, and the location in Israel is beautiful. Really left me pondering the enduring appeal of the story of Jesus, his mission, and crucifixion. Very dramatic - get this one!"
4,jesus christ superstar,"i am only 16 and may be a younger fan of the work of the likes of Lloyd-Webber, Rice,and Sondheim, but i feel that i know a good musical when i see one. Superstar is one musical that will never 'grow old' or fade away, it covers a topic that almost everyone comes across everyday in their lives. The video may not have many fancy lighting techniques or even any flash costumes (save the superstar costumes) but the theme makes it a whole lot more believable and realistic. Carl Anderson has the voice that many man envy, a flexible vocal range that carries the role of Judas off perfectly. Ted Neely, although bringing the high notes to a whole new level,he also seemed too quiet or even frail for the part of Jesus. The cast together, formed a great chorus and Herod's Song added that touch of humor. The whole bus thing was confusing at first, but i slowly grew to like it's symbolism. And yes, the backward glancs from Carl Anderson at the end was the icing on the cake."
5,jesus christ superstar--special edition,"this is the most amazing movie i've seen on the last week of christ's life. awesome production. i love the scenery, the music, and ted neely's singing. the garden of gethsemane is the best song."
4,Jesus Christ Superstar DVD,It is a great Musical. It teaches about Jesus Christ from a new prospective. Some parts are controversial but that what makes it more fascinating
4,"You loved it then, You'll love it now !!","This is a great transfer of a 70's movie!!!Very Good quality visually and audibly !It is as good now as it was back then.Actually, I think we saw more in it now than we did before.The actors/ singers did wonderful performances and the movie draws you in.Showed it to the kids....teens and up .....they lOVED it !!They wondered how an 'old' musical could look so good and be great viewing in 2009Even the music is still 'with it'Other older kids want to see it after they heard we had it.Amazing!!Andrew LLoyd Webber is a genius !!!"
4,Great Songs. '70's to the bone,"For a long time I was under the impression that all musicals were really stupid, especially the pompous crap by Andrew Lloyd Webber. But the music in JCS is absolutely awesome and rockin' and electrifying. Everybody is singing their asses off. The film itself is pretty entertaining, and it gets really intense towards the end (obviously: I mean, they CRUCIFY somebody.) The film is about the 1970's as much as it is about Jesus: the pseudo hippie clothes and hair, and the rather scandalous scene of Jesus enjoying a backrub from Mary Magdalene make for a more complex message. I don't like Christianity, but that doesn't really matter because the story being told is so beautiful and engrossing. Its not perfect, but the songs are so friggin' good that you can kind of forget about the lame dancing around."
4,33 Languages,"Good program. Had trouble using it with Vista. Ran it in compatibility mode for Windows XP, now runs great. I recommend it."
5,Not bad for the price I paid for it.,Pleasantly surprised with this product. Loved the DVD format on the PC. We homeschool and it's a great way to teach a new language without having to create the course outline. Some games are not working though (missing files and need to re-start the program)...just need to work with the ones that do work. Good value for what I paid for.
1,"Great Product, Just Not From This Company","The product works great but the company advertised the items price as ""$9.59 ($0.80 / Item)"". The ad never says how many of the item you are ordering, but when you divide $9.59 by .80 for get 12, which one would assume means you are ordering a box of 12 rolls for $9.59. Instead I got one roll, which I could have bought for a quarter of that price from dozens of other companies."
1,"???? Used to be six rolls, now its only one???","I bought this tape from this exact same listing before and it was six rolls for the regular price. When I ordered it this time it showed that it was on sale. I thought ""great,"" but when I recieved it I only got one roll. What a scam. It's not worth the shipping so I am just switching to a different company."
3,Nothing new in here,"This book was relatively interesting, but if you really want to dig into the detail about Wilhelm II's life, you'd be better off with Lamar Cecil's two volume work. There really wasn't much new news in here, and Van der Kiste treated his subject pretty lightly, all things considered. Excellent bibliography, though."
4,Victim or Warmonger,"As with several figures in history, readers either like them or hate them. The middle of the road is less traveled. Kaiser Wilhelm is one of those characters. John Van Der Kiste tells a concise tale of the last Kaiser's life which tends to have an apologetic tone to it. Van Der Kiste hits the highlights of the Kaiser's life from his early life to the end of the First World War. In situations where the Kaiser made a mistake of failed to stand up for himself (to Bismarck and later to Hindenburg and Ludendorff) he points out what went wrong and often explains to his deformity or troubled childhood. Van Der Kiste does not overly praise Wilhelm but is not as hard on him as other biographers or historians. The reader is left feeling sorry for Wilhelm instead of hating him, which was probably the author's intent.Van Der Kiste's book is concise and as another reviewer stated, more in-depth works exist for a better understanding. This book is a good introduction to the last Kaiser."
3,The kaiser leading his country to ruin.,"This is a short biography of Germany's Last Emperor, William II.As stated previously, it is short and a summary of his life.The story includes his own downfall, leading Germany to theWeimar Republic and then Nazi Germany.The book does its best work in describing William's early life,and his frosty relations with his English mother and relatives.This led to alienation from the English royalty and preventedGermany from forming an alliance with Great Britain, and a moreliberalized regime in Germany.The book describes William's views on Jews, French, Russia, andGreat Britain. This was not a positive side to his personality.Also detailed is his relationship to his mother, wife, and various mistresses, with a possible homosexual relationship withhis best friend. The author does not go into detail into thislast aspect, because there is not much evidence. His choice ofpeople to lead his Empire resulted in the First World War."
5,Best natural soap,I have bought this soap repeatedly for the past year. I use it on my face (acne prone/oily) it is amazing. it gives a great sense of cleansing. the tea tree used in it has antibacterial properties. i have used many many different types of cleansers and soaps over the years nothing comes close to this all natural soap.
2,It made me itch,"Based the the previous reviews, I really wanted to like this. I was hoping that the tea tree in it would help my extra sensitive skin (as other tea tree products have in the past. The aroma was okay. But after using the soap, I developed a horrible itchy rash that lasted several days."
1,Holy Marketing Strategy!,"Kids get bombarded at every angle with the message that junk food is fun, kid-friendly, and harmless. Now it's educational? I would run, not walk, from any book like this. If you want your kid to count food, at least pick something nutritious. There's no need to line Nabisco's pockets at the expense of your children's health. They'll get the junk food message everywhere else--let's at least try to keep it out our children's books."
3,"Good, but where do you put it?","I got one of these through Gold Box, and it works as advertised (heats up a towel, or better yet several towels, if you put them there for a few hours). However, all of the outlets in our bathrooms are close to the sinks, which makes it really hard to place the drying rack somewhere useful.If you have a (presumably GFCI) outlet on a wall in your bathroom close to where you'd get out of the tub, where a cord wouldn't block access to a cabinet or create a tripping hazard, this is a pretty cool product. Watch out that you don't touch the heated surfaces directly -- you won't really get a burn, but it doesn't feel all that good."
4,Warmrails freestanding towel warmer,"I like these warmrails in the bathroom for towels - do not feel they would work for drying swimwear, as they state. You must keep the towels layered on them at all times, with the unit on. I bought this item for my sister and she did not like it - no place to put in bathroom and electrical outlet to plug into. A flop for a present."
3,Needs more description,"There was little description for this drum set besides the measurements and they drums it included. The drums are not quite like a toy, but no where near like the real thing. It says for kids ages 10 and up ( the box says 6 and up)... well it is way too tiny for a child of that age. It's going to be small for my average sized 6 yr old. The first one we recieved had a broken peice but thankfully Amazon makes returns simple and painless unlike alot of other websites. It's a decent buy for the money, but mainly if you have a child under the age of 4, don't care about having realistic sound, or have little space for a larger one."
1,Chinatown,"I agree with the other reviewer. I can't believe amazon is allowing this kind of theft to take place. I bought these at the nearby Chinese Herb store for $2.85, tax included!! same exact box and everything. The place I get them from is called ""Thousand Chinese herbs"" don't know if they ship though."
1,So overpriced it's bizarre,Please note that you can acquire these very same herbs for about $9 retail from almost any supplier on the web or much less in Chinatown. Wholesale price to practitioners is about $3.45 per bottle plus shipping
1,Why cant their be a no star option?,"I have no idea how this piece of garbage got 4 stars. It is literally the worst made thing is have ever encountered in my life. The pieces are TINY and break freaking easily. This is from building it for 40 minutes and it seems like it is going to take at least another 3 days to complete it. As the other review said, i would pay an extra 10 dollars if it came assembled. I feel like such a moron for paying 14 bucks for something that will not work if i break a tiny little piece. If you think you might take a chance and buy this thing, DONT."
3,Party For One,"""Doll Face"" is an ususual story, even for those of us who collect or frequently read books about dolls. The main character, a doll with pink hair, wants to throw a party and spends the story rounding up her party guests. Each ""guest"" is an item(like the plate, silverware, chair, balloon, and a piano) that has something to contribute to the party. I would have liked to have seen other dolls invited to the party because it ends up looking like a party for one, which was a disappointment. However, young Barbie fans who understand the dancing teapots and candlesticks in ""Beauty and the Beast"" will enjoy this story. When I previewed the book without reading the text, I found the illustrations were inviting enough to make me curious enough to read the story. The illustrations are brightly colored eye candy that lend to the party theme in the book, which make this book worth adding to my collection."
3,Seymour Duncan SH-13 Dimebucker Pickup,"Its a nice improvement and has the lead tone to it that I needed this guitar to have.Its meant to have distortion on it(I mean cmon DIMEBUCKER), and doesnt actually feedback or hum all that often compared to the pickup it replaced.The sustain is slightly improved but nothing to really brag about.Harmonics are amazing though.They come out strong, its all I really wanted it to do-have strong harmonics and a lead tone, and I got what I wanted. For me its a ten, but I give an 8 on rating cause its limited in its uses.If you wanted to try more clean sounds, you need to have a nice neck pickup cause this isnt going to cut it.Luckily im not in aband and can improve what I want when I want, so I dont have to jump on the next pickup.And yeah I obviously chose this cause Im a duncan fan, and a Dime fan.I mean I couldnt pass it up when i decided to upgrade, and its worth it."
5,The Best,"I have all of the current, in print Catskill guidebooks, and this one is the best by far. It's authoritative and well written...and by a single author. the competing book, by ADK, was originally written by about 30 contributors--and there's no map, so you have to buy the Conference maps. There's no BS in this book, either--no pretentious, over authoritative hype...just clean straight forward trail information by someone who is probably the single most knowledgeable Catskill hiker ALIVE. Get it...you'll love it."
3,Okay... could be more specific.,This is really not to bad of a book. The map is helpful especially when driving to locate trailheads!!. I've been up two of the trails and they were fairly correct on the distance and time required. I think the author could have been more specific in his directions as to how to use the book (ie whether the distances and times are one way or round trip). He seems like he is speaking to someone who has been in the region and not to someone like me who is used to the type of hiking on the west coast. I also needed the map to figure out what he was talking about most of the time. I wouldn't complain if there were a few pictures.In summation... a solid effort but I've read better.
3,Fair warning time.,"I LOVE DEVO. But just in case you are a casual consumer you should note that, for the same price, you can get the 16 track ""Greatest Hits."" The aforementioned disc includes both ""Beautiful World"" and ""Through Being Cool,"" which would both rate on my list of an essential Devo disc.Forewarned is forearmed."
5,Good deal,I love this product. It was a great buy for the price. I would get this product again. Amazon had the best deal on this product at the time. This was just what I was looking for.
2,Not too good,"Not exactly the ideal headset. Very cheaply made, and flimsy. Sound quality Ok, and the mic picks up good, but the craftsmanship was sorry. Within 2 days the ear piece fell apart revealing very fragile wiring. The over ear clip is very cheap and thin. It will move back and forth very easily. Pretty good price, but buy something better."
4,Jabra C150,"It works really well and people can hear me just fine, the only thing i don't like is that it doesn't stay positioned in the ear very well. But that may just be me... it might fit others just fine."
1,Horrible Customer Service,"I could not track my package, so after a little search found their phone number, it is (800)737-0778 with hours: 9-6pm CST. ""Lady"" who answered sounded like she was upset because I was bothering her. She explained to me that even though I ordered on the weekend, my headset did not ship until Tuesday and the expedited is just priority mail, so TOTAL ripoff as they charge more than double for it! So buy from these people only if this is your only option."
2,Waste of $83.00,"I read this book and to be honest with you, I felt that I wasted 83 bucks in buying it. It focuses way too much on percentages rather than involving the reader in actually learning something. Statistical evidence is a good way to learn but in this case, it takes the subject to the extreme. My sociology professor required this book and I am getting more and more bored with the reading. Anyway, if you have to get it, spend some time and look for it used.........the only thing you will learn is how to shop around."
5,I really like this artist,"I have several Cahal Dunne CD's and enjoy each of them. An Irish accent, a soothing voice, and the choice of songs makes for enjoyable, relaxing listening."
2,Disapointed,Not liking the texture of this product. Since it is all natural I thought I'd give it a try. Now I'm giving it away.
3,Malcolm excellent..flute ok,"I'm know I have perhaps been spoiled, but the definitive collection of these sonatas (in my opinion)is the Elaine Shaffer/George Malcolm Angel recordings of the 60's. Malcolm is at his perky and jaunty best here. The flute playing is also good, in tune, and light on the vibrato which is a miracle considering the flautist studied with Rampal. But there is something missing....Shaffer's playing of the B minor was haunting and ethereal and there were lots of musical nuances which are also missing in this ""straight forward,"" and may I add ""fast"" performances. Let us not forget Shaffer was william kincaid's prize pupil and beneficiary of his platinum and golden Powell flutes (now in the Smithsonian). The quality of sound in this recording is excellent. Malcolm absolutely shines as a harpsichordist and makes the recording a good listen."
4,So that's why college football is so bizarre,"This book is absolutely essential reading for anyone who is interested in the business of college football. Even if you are just a casual college football fan, this book is pretty easy to read and helps explain a lot of things, like how Notre Dame can remain outside of the conference system and why the post season is so chaotic.If there is any short-coming, it might be that the book focuses a little too much on the internal management of the NCAA, especially the consolidation of power that occurred under Wally Byers. But, in the end, this is such a gigantic subject that it had to have some kind of hook."
3,"It works, but I have no idea how someone would shred a credit card","For a few scissors stuck together, it works well shredding a few sheets of paper. It is hard to get it to cut thicker things than this. Much more compact than an actual shreder, and better than just tearing up the bills."
2,disappointing,I was disappointed with this product. The handle cracked on its first use. You can cut through very thin pieces of paper (such as a single credit card receipt) but even with normal weight paper it jams or gets stuck. It wasn't worth the money. I have more success with snipping at receipts with a regular pair of scissors.
1,Awesome gag gift for someone in the office,"Seriously, right? It's a laser on a scissor. Once you get past the fact that running with them is now dangerous to any retina within laser beam distance, you soon realize that using a guide to cut that moves with the scissor is a rather silly idea. Sure you're cuts will be laser straight, but if your hand isn't, well, then...you get the idea."
2,The scissors work fine but...,I received these from my Aunt who purchased them and was disappointed with them and when I said it was a cool concept she let me have them. The scissors themselves work like you would expect from your run of the mill scissors however the laser guide is just gimmicky. The problem with the laser guidance system is that if you turn the scissors slightly the line moves with it so it serves absolutely no purpose. For that reason alone I could not give this a good score however I gave it one extra then the 1 star the laser guidance system would warrant because the scissor portion is perfectly functional.
1,total boondogle,"This item sounded like a great idea, but it just doesn't work. The scissors are too bulky and awkward for any normal hand. In addition, the laser shows a straight line, but not necessarily in the direction you meant to go. All in all, a waste of money."
1,What was I thinking?,"I don't know why on earth I bought these things. I guess for a low price, I thought these scissors would be worth trying. I wanted them for cutting a straight line through lengths of fabric.Heh, they were so awful, the laughs were worth the money (that and I now have a new pair of scissors AND my dogs have a new laser toy).The problem? The laser makes this line that you are supposed to cut on...but as you cut and your hand moves, the laser moves, so the whole thing is pointless. Oh well."
1,Logical fallacy,"These scissors are based on a logical fallacy that assumes that because a laser shows a straight line, your hand will cut along the same line too.The problem with these scissors is that, because your (shaky) hand guides the scissor blades AND the laser, the line constantly moves along with the blades. Accidentally turn the blade 10 degrees? The laser turns too! This renders the laser utterly useless.I have to say, I'm astonished a company actually went through the entire production process without a single team member realizing that their laser-scissors idea is fundamentally impossible. I think some people need to be fired..."
1,Idea Does Not Work,"Who are these reviewers who gave this item five stars? It doesn't even do a good job at shredding one page at time. Unless you antiicpate needing to shred documents on a desert island, forget this product."

1,Save Your Money- I Wish I Had,She does not give clear voice instructions and the camera gets so close to her body that you cannot see what she is doing.
3,Does the job.,"This program will indeed stretch you. The stretches are fairly easy while still being effective. It's not too difficult and it's a nice short and to the point program (about 20 minutes). The only drawbacks are the out of date cheezy factor, which isn't really a big deal. Her voice is a tad annoying as she tries to sound breathy and soothing, but doesn't quite pull it off. I don't regret buying it. It does get used but less often then my other stretching/yoga tapes."
3,The New Age Way To A Healthier You,"Denise does a complete stretch session, stretching all the muscles from stem to stern. The only problem I had with the video is that is is New Age in tone, music and setting, and if I had known that, I wouldn't have picked it."
3,Beautiful but tricky,"The projects are drop dead beautiful in here, but for some reason, I cannot master the basic first project, a bookmark!! And I have much experience with beading stitches. Essential info is left out, like what size beads to use, and advice to measure and mark carefully, important for a beginner. I don't understand why I have tried this bookmark about five times, and still cannot figure it out. It may be me."
2,DON'T PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS ONE!,"This is not a keeper. I'm not saying throw it back, just don't pay full price for this book. The story would have worked much better had EB limited her use of ""uh"", ""eh"", ""um"", ""mmm"", ""hmm"", and ""gee."" A little of this and the reader thinks it's cute, but too much will drive you crazy. To make matters worse, the hero is primarily the guilty party. Instead of making him endearing, he comes across as being inept. Let's hope this isn't a trend which EB plans to adopt for future books. If you haven't read ""How To Trap A Tycoon"". . .do so. It's EB at her best."
2,Not Gripping,"Yet another contemporary romance which stars a private investigator as a bodyguard to the heroine [actually two of the PIs]. What the threat is, in addition primarily to being 20 years in the past, is kept a secret; thus the reader can't worry too much about the heroine and her sister. The romantic conflict is that the hero can't get involved with heroine again after he had a crush on her in high school, while the heroine is just touchy about everything. It just isn't a gripping premise, and nothing as the story progresses makes it more so. I'm sure Bevarly is an accomplished author, but she is obviously turning out ill-conceived projects to meet rapid-fire publisher deadlines, with the result I just put the book aside even though I was trapped on a non-stop cross-country flight with nothing else to read."
2,Framework for coping with disruptive changes,"Clark Gilbert and Joseph L. Bower are Assistant Professor and Professor at Harvard Business School respectively. This article was published in the May 2002-issue of Harvard Business Review.We all experience different changes in our lives and the way we approach those changes, either as a threat or an opportunity, shapes our behavior...This disappointing article attempts to provide a framework to cope with disruptive change. It is an interesting subject, but the authors do not really enter the territory by great depths. The focus is primarily on the impact of the Internet on traditional organizations, but even on this subject the authors barely touch the surface. There are some interesting remarks, but most of it has already been said before. The article is written in simple business US-English."
3,It was cool...,"I had gotten this back when it first came out, in 1995. All the CD-ROM stuff worked perfectly fine w/ the computer I had at that time. Then my family got a new computer, as well as myself getting a new one... and none of the CD-ROM stuff would work. I have no idea why. It was really good though, like seeing the videos of 'Everything Zen' and 'Little Things'. I also liked some of the interviews and photos. I just wish it worked again."
3,good but ....,"I bought this cd from a used store. This certain edition of little things boasts added features such as games, wallpaper, and other computer enhanced things.. NOTHING, I've used 6 computers and i have none of it on my disc, but the songs are excellent.."
2,expected a lot more,"Wanted to return this book, but because i live in Singapore..i would have to spend more for freight just to return it.I really expected more from such a great title.Writer did't get me excited over Jesus as the title suggested."
3,A waste of a great title,"The title notwithstanding, this book doesn't really say all that much about Jesus. Nor does it say anything critical about religion per se, or why it might be good to have less of it. Instead, the book attempts to describe the authors' idea of a healthy faith; and each of the book's 16 chapters is subtitled ""A Healthy Faith Is... [Balanced, Loving, Respectful of Others, etc.]""I wouldn't be at all surprised if this book started out as a series of sermons. Each chapter reads like a sermon given in a friendly evangelical church: inspiring, encouraging, with nothing too deep or challenging or complicated or critical. As to the intended audience, the authors mention Chuck Swindoll as though they expect readers to know who he is. In fact, the book is reminiscent of Swindoll, and fans of Swindoll should find this book right up their alley. Others may or may not find it helpful, depending on where they're coming from and where they are in their spiritual lives."
5,Those Who Out-Generaled Germany's Generals,"""Stalin's Generals"", edited by Harold Shukman, is a wonderful collection of essays on the Red Army generals of World War II. Each author brings a real depth of understanding to not only the men, but also the military and political institutions of the Soviet Union of the time. One can gradually follow through many of these pieces the character of Josef Stalin himself. Stalin's transformation from jealous guardian of military power to warlord who actually trusted his officers is a central theme of most of the essays. The essays on Rokossovsky, Zhukov, Koniev, Shaposhnikov and Vasilevsky are particularly insightful and informative. This is a great work for both causal readers and serious students of the Eastern Front in World War II."
1,"mistaken ""order""","I did not order this product, and did not receive it. This is all a big mistake and has nothing to do with me."
1,Unsatisfied,"I purchased what I thought to be the 3rd edition of this book, however, I received the 2nd edition. When I tried to contact the sender about the mistake they never got back to me. The photo of the book was a photo of the 3rd edition as well. I am very disappointed with my purchase since I had to buy the 3rd edition anyway."
1,The thing is huge,"You can't tell from any pictures, but this thing is just a big wide vibrator. And if anyone knows anything about a vibrator, you need at least some ability of precision. You do not get that with this. The only thing this is good for massaging is a back. Save your money, get something else. Unfortunately I do not know how to return it so i'm stuck with a 40 dollar paper weight that I have to hide. What a waste of money. And for those of you trying to figure out what exactly is wrong with it, the massaging part of that ""little gem"" is 2 inches wide, 4 inches long, and almost nearly flat. Tell me what you plan to do with that."
1,not strong enough to do anything with,"It's a neat design, but not nearly strong enough. I'd be using that thing for a half hour before anything happened. my hand works better."
2,USELESS,FOUND THIS TO BE DISAPPOINTING GIVEN THE GOOD REPORTS YOU HAD ABOUT IT. HAD TO RETURN IT. IT'S GOOD FOR MASSAGING A BABY'S BACK.
5,nice plush toy,"I bought this for my daughter, who misses the family dog (a yellow lab) while she is away college. She loves it. It is soft, very plush and very cute, as you would expect from Ty. It is not inexpensive as stuffed animals go, but for us, it's a great choice."
5,Soothing & Stimulating at the Same Time,"I read about this CD in a book by Julia Cameron. She wrote that when she needs to feel safe and secure, this is what she cues up to set the mood. Since I so enjoy having her as my own personal creative therapist (through her books), I decided to give Hoppe a try. Julia was right-again. The combination of quiet synthesizers and a luminous flute, with simple melodies that gently lead your soul, is a welcome respite from a noisy world. I found the music set my mind free to wander or just float freely. There's a fascinating backstory to this collection of compositions as well."
2,disappointed,"I was so excited to purchase this CD. The reviews were so glowing and enthusiastic about the music. I was sure I would love it. Well......I didn't. The music was all right, but surely not the most beautiful I'd ever heard. And, I discovered that I could hear an intake of breath after every phrase. I found this to be very distracting. I will most likely pass this CD along to my mother, and if she doesn't like it, it will probably go to Goodwill."
1,Horrible Condition,"I ordered all 5 books in this series but had to order them separately to get them all. They were from different vendors I believe but all fulfilled through Amazon. The book I got in this order, book 4 ""The birth of Flux and Anchor"" was in horrible condition when I got it. The spine was creased in three places. The cover has been folded over and creased. The edges of the book all around are scuffed. If it weren't for the fact that the return shipping cost more than the book I'd return it immediately. The description for this book should read, ""Cover and spine damaged and creased but the pages are readable."" It should be rated no higher than poor or very poor (whatever the lowest category is). It was rated either good or very good when I bought it. What a joke."
3,cassette,"Received it on time, but hadn't been told that it required a specific kind of cassette player. I would have like to know before purchase. Had wanted to listen in vehicle and it is not possible."
1,Lots of glitches in details ruined the story for me.,"This story takes place in 1981; however, the child prodigy has already seen the Star Wars Trilogy (!!!) and the au pair listens to REM (debut album released in 1983). I'm not a car buff, but I can't remember ever seeing a gold Nissan Maxima in 1981. There are other gaffes that make this book very annoying. Sloppy."
3,The abridged 'book on tape' edition was TOO abridged,"Having read other Tanenbaum books, I have come to expect a detail-rich standard cop story - the details are what distinguishes Tanenbaum's work from lesser efforts.I listened to this as a book on tape and I find it to be well read and a decent story but absent all of the detail that makes a Tanenbaum's book a nice read. I felt like the new guy on the block the entire time because very few of the relationships of the principal good guys were explained.I suppose that's what one should expect when you compress a 400+ page book into a 3 hour taped reading."
3,Great (Audio) Book-- Terrible Reading,"I've read all of Tanenbaum's books about Butch Karp & Marlene Ciampi and enjoyed them thoroughly, so I was looking forward to listening to this book on tape.What a disappointment! James Daniels reads the characters with amazingly bad accents (and there are a LOT of accents), mispronounces the names of NYC landmarks (Zabars, most prominently) and has a flat reading style that gnaws at the listener the entire time.Ruined what could have been a very enjoyable book."
2,It Didn't Work For Me,"Tanenbaum is a favorite writer, but this one just did not ""rise to the level of""!"
2,glaring errors,"Previous reviewers have pointed out some of the obvious errors for a book set in 1981 - they really take you out of the story (which is not that strong to begin with). Both the 'Godfather' and 'Star Wars' trilogies are mentioned as well as ""Purple Rain"" and REM - for these not to be caught somewhere along the line suggests sloppy work"
5,incredable,this book is extreamly interesting. ill recommend it to almost everyone that can read. it makes me look at sharks another way. not only sharks but other creatures at the end. AWESOME
1,Shark Trouble: True Stories About Sharks and the Sea by the author of Jaws,"I received the wrong thing. I wanted shark life but was sent an audio version of shark trouble instead. I'm not sure how this was ordered and not the other book I wanted. Needless to say, I had to go out and buy the book because my daughter needed it for summer school reading. It was kind of annoying."
3,A contrite Benchley apologizes,"Peter Benchley apologizes for scaring everyone out of the water with ""Jaws."" This book, a collection of essays about sharks and shark attacks, allows Benchley to wax poetic about how endangered sharks are and how we as humans can protect ourselves from these creatures since we occasionally share the same ocean. Not a bad book (not nearly as bad as ""Beast"" or ""White Shark"") but not a great read, either."
2,Disappointing,"Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, pens a non-fiction book setting the record straight on shark behavior. It sounds like a great idea and it is, but the execution is horrible. I would say maybe 50% of this book is actually about sharks; the rest merely lists dangers of the ocean (rips, tides, etc.) and non-shark creatures to be feared. Useful and mildly interesting, but I wanted a *shark* book. Another irritant is Benchley's ""man is the real threat"" stance. While valid (and true), his position is presented with an incredibly heavy hand. Peter, that horse isn't getting any more dead, so lay off! It's not a good sign when I end up tossing a book on the floor and yelling ""I get it."" Overall, a massive disappointment."
4,A 12 Year-Old Seeks to Avenge His Parents' Deaths During W.W.II,"This was my son's favorite book when he was about 10 years old. It is a very touching story of a twelve year-old Jewish boy who loses his family in World War II. He joins the partisans and fights the Germans to avenge the deaths of his family and the Jews. The novel is about the partisans and boys growing to manhood during a time heavy with death, terror and loss. The book also deals with questions of faith, sorrow and loss along with man's quest for live and love despite these things.This is a wonderful book for young adults and older children."
1,Fans of Shawn Lane - THE GUITARIST...... Stay Away !!!!!,This is not the guitarist Shawn Lane from Memphis! Please look for Jonas Hellborg in the search section to get his music. No Offense to this guy! I came here looking for the other Shawn Lane. Amazon should make it clear that these two are different guys.
1,Oops! Duh!,"It would be helpful to lovers of both genres to make clear to customers that Shawn Lane the bluegrass artist is not Shawn Lane the fusion guitarist. It is very misleading if not false advertising to promote a completely different artist in the wrong category and with recommendations for the other artist with the same name. An honest enough mistake, but now that we have all been informed, how long shall we keep selling CD's to unsuspecting customers who think it is something else?"
4,hmmm,"An original and at times amusingly disgusting personal history by a pioneer of eighties underground cinema, but not the thing to read over a hearty meal. If film titles such as "" They Eat Scum"" don't sound like your cup of tea, you've been adequately warned"
2,Zedd's Dead,"If you know anything at all about the Cinema of Transgression, you'll find this book fairly interesting. Like his one-time paramour Lydia Lunch, Zedd, however, slips off into melodrama and whining nonsense far too often. Punk erotica for the self-righteously 'anarchistic'."
5,A SOURCE OF STRENGTH,"I picked up this little book in a gift shop in Stratford on Avon, England when I was traveling. In the store, I opened the book to a specific quote that was a tremendous source of strength to me regarding emotional pain I was suffering. I bought it then and there. Over the years, everytime I read this book..I am reminded what a great little gem it is. I located it here on Amazon, and have bought it for friends as a gift when they are also going through troubled times and they love it too. I also recommend ""Words on Calm"" and ""Words on Strength and Perserverance"" in the same series."
4,Something a little different.,"This British double CD set has a mixture of Christmas songs from America & England. Most date from the 30's & 40's, with a few that are earlier than that. You'll hear some of the usual, popular songs from that era including Bing Crosby, Judy Garland, and Nat King Cole. What's really fun about this collection is everything else! Lot's of oddities/rarities that you'll most likely not find anywhere else. So if you like vintage Christmas songs and are looking for something different to listen too, then definately check out this CD. My only complaint is the sound quality is somewhat uneven throughout."
5,An excellent cd!,This cd spans the years of 1915-1949. It has excellent songs recorded by the original artists. I love this! I have always liked the vintage christmas songs. It takes me back to when I was a child and my parents used to play these records at christmas. This is a great cd for a trip down memory lane! I recommend this cd!
3,TechnoGizmoBraziloOverdrive electronic music,This quirky music CD sounds like Andreas Vollenweider meets Devo. Tobin's quirky musical devices work great for the first part of the album (per music samples above); the second half though is a great endorsement of reverting to the 42 minute lp format of yore as the heavy beat gets repetitive and monotonous and begins to feel like filler. This CD is not a long term keeper but the music it contains is definitely good enough so that I'm not averse to buying another of his albums.
5,brazilianaire,"Amon Tobin is one of too few musicians in the world who write music untainted with the money lust , if you know what i mean ?His music is personal and complex , from the sounds of armageddon to a cool evening breeze . It took me quite a few listens of SUPERMODIFIED before i appreciated how cool this guy's music is . Although I didn't and never do ( but dont call me blackbeard ) I would say this one is worth the money . If you like Ween , Matmos , Prefuse 73 , KID606 , typical cats , autechre , cake , boards of canada , system of a down , kronos quartet , then you will probably be able to trust me on this one"
5,WOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOW,"This is one of the best cds I have ever heard. I listen to it nonstop. Many of the songs are as thick and lush as anything amon tobin has ever written. This is saying a lot considering the quality of his other albums. God, it is brilliant. The exotic multilayered ambiences that form the enveloping backdrop to his driving, abstract but oh so organic and rich rhythms are all encompassing. I listen to this cd on my headphones when I wander from class to class and as soon as I press play I am instantly transported into another world. His rhythms are not exactly d & b or typical break beats. He is into his own thing and he is exactly where he should be. BUY THIS ALBUM."
3,Masterful mechinations,"3 1/2Although it is easy to classify OFOW as the electronic purveyor's strongest recording, its highly detailed mechanized structures almost fall prey to a noticeable lack of melody, making the majority an insanely fluctuating, but well-oiled machine nonetheless."
1,Not a big fan,"It's not that I can't appreciate the programming skills of Amon Tobin, I just don't like this music. Besides, it looks like most of the reviews given to this album on this site are all from his fans. So I wanted to give the other perspective. Don't let anyone tell you this is d'n'b, cuz its not. There a few tunes with quicker beats but these songs could all be classified as downtempo industrial. They're all about 80 bpm, and have the ""banging on a steel barrel in a warehouse"" feel, and are all somewhat atmospheric. In the first song, he shamelessly rips off Tomita's awesome electronic cover of Claire de Lune. He gives the song its own title, but it should have been titled as a remix. So there you have it, the other perspective."
3,"The feel, the smell and the sigths of chinatown","Jack Yu has just buried his chinese born father two weeks ago. Raised in NY's Chinatown, he also has to deal with being a cop where no chinaman trust the police and where his childhood friends are the very criminals he is supposed to pursue.The plot bounces from character to character like a flea on speed which makes is difficult to follow the story until you reach the halfway point. Chinese idioms add confusion to what comes out finally as a very basic story line.The book's most interesting aspect is the successful rendition of life in Chinatown. M. Chang manages to make the reader feel, hear, smell and see the streets and its people. Jack Yu, as the american-chinese cop caught between two worlds is believable and well drawned.Because this a first effort, I will look forward M. Chang's next book and hope that he will be able to correct his writing style. He certainly has potential."
1,worth what I paid,It was free on Amazon and sounded interesting. A struggle to finish and poorly edited rife with typos and editing errors. No doubt an accruate depiction of life of NYC Chinese immigrants but a predictable plot and little character development.
2,Disappointing,"This book started out slow, picked up a little, the dropped off imto boredom again. While the author paints a colorful picture of Chinatown amd the way of life there, that is all I could find interest in. The plot strung you along at the pace of a snail crawling in circles and then left you hanging at the end. It was as if the author's editor called him and said he needed the book finished in 20 minutes. All the buildup in the last few chapters led me to believe the ending would be so much better. I found myself hitting the next page button over and over again thinking there had to be something more.While I was bored with this book 20% into it, I stayed the course and finished it, only to realize the more exciting plot I was hoping for wasn't there."
1,I gave up one third in,"I tried, but with the Chinese sprinkled in all the time it was too exhausting. A lot of introductions to characters and locations, but not much of a story."
2,Being Chinese would help,"So many words and phrases were difficult to remember and/or understand (just forget pronouncing them) with more than one name being used for the same person.Story felt disjointed and characters seemed a little flat. It took me 1-1/2 weeks to get through it; I do try to finish a book to give it a fair chance since someone took the time to write it.Not being familiar with the Chinese underworld and heirarchy, I could only try to keep up. Sometimes I succeeded, sometimes not so much.I did like Detective Jack to a degree (which is probably why I finished the book), but I didn't feel like I learned to know Jack as well as I would have liked. He seemed to be stuck in a hate/love relationship between two cultural worlds, but couldn't quite make both work for him at same time. It does appear at the very end he has made a choice, but I'll have to try a ""sample"" before I buy the sequel."
3,A solid B,"I'll give this a B+ for atmosphere and a B- for plot. The atmosphere is great and you really get a better perspective on the triads and the overseas chinese associations. The storyline I found a little weak and meandering. I'll still buy the next installment though, just to give Henry the benefit of the doubt."
4,Chinatown Beat,"The author is the Dashiell Hammett of Chinatown. An intense reading experience, shedding light on aspects of New York one does not usually think about. Great characters, especially Mona, and I can't wait for the sequel."
2,Not for me,"While the plot was engaging and the characters realistic and colorful, it seemed to be disjointed and abrupt going from chapter to chapter instead of flowing smoothly. The writing style left me confused as to whether I had missing chapters or not. The detail was great and easily brought Chinatown to life. I can't say I will read anymore books by this author. but that is a personal preference on my part for the flow of the book and not due the stort itself."
1,Pass this one up,"Author likes to bombard you with chinese words all through the story, kinda distracting. Weak plot and not much character development.Typos and hyphenating of words that don't need it all the through the book, needs a good proofreading.The story had potential and some parts were interesting but it was severely lacking."
1,"good atmosphere, distasteful subject matter","The Chinatown atmosphere is great but between child rapists and sex slaves and the brutality of the Chinese mafia the subject matter was too disturbing for me, couldn't finish it."
3,Solid beginning,"Good beginning, but the Chinatown details felt more like a synopsis than a thesis. Plenty of interesting characters. It will be fun to see where the author takes us from here."
4,A cut above,"My favorite aspect of this book is the prose. The author writes well - not just clearly but with originality (in his choice of words).The plot moves fairly fast, there are quite a few characters and there are very few recaps. The reader has to pay attention. Some facets of the plot are very original but others are predictable. Nevertheless, the quality of the writing and the pace kept me interested even during the predictable parts.The information about Chinese-American culture is fascinating. Again, the reader is not spoon-fed by the author, and some aspects of the culture are presented clearly but not actually explained."
2,Ok Book,"I bought this because it was free for Kindle. I read about 30% off the book before I couldn't take it anymore. Even from where I stopped, the plot was not clear. The author seems to want to teach you more about Chinese words and Chinatown than actually writing a book. There wasn't an even flow while reading because of the Chinese words. And honestly, if you don't know Chinese, writing in Chinese and the correct pronunciation it are two different things.I know Chinatown so while I was excited to read it, I had to give up. One positive note is if you did want to know more about Chinatown, you get to see a glimpse of it."
3,eh.,"Chinatown Beat was an interesting book, but not, in my opinion, a great book, It was pretty good.The images of the underbelly of Chinatown were vivid, and I wanted more about that. The power struggle of the underworld characters was the most interesting aspect of the book.The characters were flat; it was hard to engage with any of them, even the protagonist.The plot had gaps which were frustrating; for example...at the beginning of the book there was a brutal rape of a young child.The protagonist was investigating this, and unable to find the rapist, or even learn his identity. Then the rapist meets with ""justice"" near the end, and the reader was ""left out"" of it. Frustrating and unsatisfying."
4,"Uneven start, but overall good writing...","Uneven start, but overall good writing...Chang not only gives us a good cop story, but he manages to develop it with factoids about the Chinatown culture. The character development is above average for a debut novel. Although the story lags in some parts, overall it is a good read. The ending is unfinished and leaves it wide open for a sequel. Chang is an author to watch in the future. (Free i-touch edition is missing the last two pages.)Keep in mind that this is a gritty mystery with a Chinatown flavor.4* of 5*"
4,A Gritty Debut,"Jack Yu is a man haunted by his past and uncertain in his place. A New York City detective assigned to the Fifth Precinct in Chinatown, he faces daily prejudice from his brother officers and contempt in the community he serves.He is a man tormented by anger--anger over the sudden death of his father who never accepted the son's choice of career, anger at those who prey upon the people least able to defend themselves, anger at those who accept things as they are.But he is a good detective, and this is most ably demonstrated when he takes the lead in a case where a serial rapist is targeting young Chinese girls. This plotline is subsumed when Jack is drawn into another case where the mistress of a Tong leader takes drastic action to gain her freedom, resulting in a cross-country chase and a life-changing conclusion.There are rich characters and exciting plot elements here, though the story does meander a bit. I hope to read more about Jack Yu in other books in Chang's series."
1,Leaking air within a month of use,"I bought two tubes and new tires to replace on my son's bicycle. I tested the new tubes by filling air and putting the tubes in a bucket of water to check for air leaks before installing. The tube was easy to install and has a good quality valve (seemed better than the original valve). Unfortunately, after just a few uses, the tube started leaking air. I removed it and found that the joint between the tube and the valve was weak and that is where the air leaks. The leak was small but rendered the tube useless. Disappointed."
4,One of the best in a long time,"I realy like this film, the story line is ok, its not one of those films that will leave you on the seat of your pants hanging on the next breath of the characters. The acting is great and the scenes are perfect. The film has something for everyone. A storyline that will leave you wondering what will happen next and all types of screen candy. If you are looking for an innocent film for the family this is definetly one to pass up. But if you do not mind some skin in your film its great."
3,"rent this for one of the stars, not the story","Even for a film in this genre, the plot, pacing, and acting are pretty amateurish, but this is still worth checking out for one of the lead actresses. She's billed here as Tracy Smith, although in one recent film (also from Eros) she uses Tracy Ryan. Under any name, she's a knockout: a statuesque blond who's NOT enhanced (for a nice change). Although her acting is sometimes a little awkward, she throws herself into the love scenes (with men and women) with real enthusiasm and energy. As always with the Eros films, be sure you get the unrated version!"
3,Irish music or country music,Those who loves pure and more traditional Irish music may find too much country music overtone.
5,Victorinox Super Tinker,"These are really cool, I got one for my husband, son-in-law and myself. So handy to have in your purse, instead of carrying a bunch of tools. My husband has already used it numerous times."
5,Great knife!,"After looking around a bit at swiss army knives I decided on this one. It has all the functions that the average joe would need including two knife blades, can and bottle openers (which also have standard screwdrivers on the ends), a phillips head screwdriver, and some kind of needle thingy that I think is used for leather work or something. The one thing this knife does not have is a pair of scissors - although I don't really know why anyone would need such a small pair of scissors when you have two knife blades. All and all if you want a good knife just to carry around this is a pretty good choice. It fits easily into your front pocket without being obtrusive or anything, if it was any bigger you'd need to carry it on your belt. The fact that the case is translucent is pretty cool. Although it's great looking, this is a true swiss army knife and is made to be used. Oh...and lets not forget the toothpick and tweezers. They are sure to come in handy."
3,Pretty: But less useful than other smaller models,Nice looking pocket knife. I don't know decides or how the decisions are made about what features to include on each model. This one has a nearly full size (Phillips head) screwdriver - which I will rarely if ever use: and lacks a simple scissors - an item I had come to expect routinely on even the smallest of 'keychain' Swiss Army knives and an item that I use at least a couple of times each and every day of my life. I think in this case that style got the upper hand over function - and too bad.... as functionality has been to key to the success of Swiss Army knives under any of the now many brands that manufacture them with some version of the Red Cross emblazoned on them.I'll put this one away to give as a gift to someone who needs a bit less funtion and a bit more style than I require.
1,"Not the book shown in the ""Look Inside""","This paperback edition does *NOT* include side-by-side English-Latin as indicated in the images. Very disappointing. Amazon should make sure they are picturing the proper product on their site. The cover image is correct, but that's it. *Do not* purchase this item if you are looking for English-Latin. I am going to cross my fingers and purchase the hardcover in hopes that it might be accurately represented."
5,Great edition of a wonderful early Renaissance work,"Boccaccio's De Claribus Mulieribus (Of Famous Women) is a wonderful compendium of 100 classical and medieval stories about pagan women (and six about Christian women). you can read about Amazons, courtesans, chaste wives and teacherous ones, Queens and poets. Virginia Brown's translation is excellent, and it is invaluable to have the Latin text on facing pages. (Note: only the hardback edition has the Latin)."
5,10 Exitos Románticos 10,"Este CD esta Exelente, son canciones muy románticas salio en el año 1994 y ya a sido descontinuado. Estas son las canciones:1. Una lagrima2. Mi delito3. Ella4. No la critiquen5. ¿Que horas son?6. Correme7. En donde estes8. La unica estrella9. Te quiero mucho10. Un minuto de amor"
1,This book is a visual lie.,"Danny Lyon has put together a collection of photographs that depict American Indians as the saddest and most hopeless people ever known to man. This supposed documentary photographer has obviously imposed his own visual aesthetic upon his subjects to exaggerate their poverty and despair. This collection of work is a pretentious ""disease of the week"" photo story. The only positive emotion found in these photos is the result of the reunion of a couple separated from each other by a prison sentence. Although American Indians face a plethora of problems they are among the most resilient people on the face of this earth. They smile, laugh and love, but Lyon chose to leave all of this out. It saddens me to see someone who has done admirable work in the past stoop to this level. Oh, by the way, Larry McMurty's introduction stinks as well. He states that drunken driving accidents are among the commonest of events on western American Indian Reservations."
2,a bit dull,"Like many Americans, I sometimes think of history as only involving famous persons, wars, or cultural events. I often forget that edifices and inventions play a role too. So this disc speaks of the dam, why it was needed, its details, and how it made Las Vegas the celebrated city that it is. It also explains how the dam got named after President Hoover. It's not a bad work, but I found myself dozing off a bit. Maybe engineers and science lovers would appreciate this work more. There are more interesting installments in the ""Am. Ex."" series for me."
3,Good Information But...,"Good information but poorly written, edited and published. Contains some technical errors.Worthwhile as starting point."
2,Not impressed,"The rinser does not give a powerful enough spray to actually clean the holding tank. It doesn't reach all areas, just the area that the nozzle is pointed to, which isn't much. Very disappointed."
1,Not enough water flow,"I purchased this a month ago..used it the first time let the water flow for 30 minutes thought that was plenty time to rinse the black water tank...went back camping again 3 weeks later...the smell almost knocked me out...I did use a waste breakdown chemical, but it did not rinse the tank out completely..there is not enough pressure and water coming out of this thing to get to the back of the tank...very disappointed!"
2,water pressure,"I thought I was buying a flush king, but I was not paying attention to what I was doing. I do not think this thing is going to work very well. I have one of the small units (without the gate), and it is worthless.The small jet stream will not flush the tank or the hose.Camco 39062 RV Dual Flush Pro Holding Tank Rinser with Gate ValveI think I probably wasted my money"
2,Does Not Rinse My Tanks,Does not send the water spray up to any of the holding tanks. Does a great job rinsing the hose.
3,The Way It Used To Be,"A very traditional text, with excellent information that should be a part of every Mason's education. Each jurisdictions has its own practices, but this is an excellent primer, and an excellent refresher for ""experienced"" Masons. Not bad information for the non-Mason, too."
3,Detailed,"First of all I must say that this is my first try on something like this. I tried to make the ship as detailed as I could and I think it the end result is good, the ship has a lot of little details that make it really look interesting, which is obviously good.The problem that I have is that I am an adult and it was pretty complicated to put together some things, I do not know if a kid would actually have the patience and ability to make it without getting frustrated. I think the order in the instruction manual is not the better."
5,An adult's toy,I love this ship. Very detail. You need patient to build this up. It took me about 2 month to finish the whole thing. It came out great.
5,Egg Rings,"I really love these rings! I bought them for making English muffins, but I have used them for eggs, too. They were a little pricier than the plainer rings, but they are non-stick and that makes my muffin-making a much more pleasant experience! Good price, too!"
3,Egg Muffin not so much,Unless you are using hamburger buns for muffins this won't work the 3 stars are for great customer service! Make great small pancakes.
2,Not As Advertised,"This item is described as non-stick and it is anything but that. It is not only NOT non stick it is also difficult to clean. It does a good enough job keeping the eggs in shape but the first challenge is getting the egg unstuck, the second challenge is removing the ring without burning yourself. Very disappointed in this product, especially the inaccurate description."
3,Hmmm,"I can't say whether or not this is a great item... I was planning to buy it, had it in my cart and then noticed it was Norpro ""666."" I refuse to buy something with the mark of the devil on it. Guess I'll be in search of a different egg ring - too bad b/c this one looked the best of the ones I had seen so far."
4,"Norpro 666 Nonstick Egg Rings, 2-Piece Set","I like these as they make perfect size eggs for the popular breakfast sandwich made with english muffins. Simply spray with cooking spray prior to using and the eggs wont stick and the rings are easily removed. Since there is no handle, use a fork to remove from pan without burning your fingers."
2,disappointed,"If you need to buy some make sure you get one with handles. Egg sticks to it even if oiled, couple runs in dishwasher and they start to rust."
5,Godinger Rose Satin album,Very nice album for wedding pictures! It has a beautiful rose on the front to accent your favorite event picture. The pictures easily slide into the covers.
4,Cool classics... reasonable price.,"This ""greatist hits"" album is a cool one, but does not contain all of the classics. However, make sure you check out their website, to listen to their original scores (www.LosRockinDevils.Net). This site includes a brief history of Mexican rock and the important role of Los Rockin Devil's during this irreversible rise of the Mexican counterculture.Also included is a list of almost every album produced from the 60's to early 80's, as well as some current albums, and their respective track lists and notes."
4,Uncut Flair vs. Mr. Perfect saves this tape!,"Overall this tape is rather boring until the last match--the 1993 Raw Ric Flair vs. Mr. Perfect loser leaves the WWF match that appeared in edited form on the new Best of Raw 15th Anniversary DVD. The dvd edited the match down to 12 minutes, while the tape has the complete 20 minute segment (minus the original commercial interuptions).Other matches include:Savage vs. Terry TaylorUndertaker vs. BerzerkerShawn Michaels vs. VirgilBret Hart vs. KamalaMoney Inc. vs. Nasty Boysplus other matches featuring ""stars"" of the era like Bossman, High Energy, Crush, Papa Shango, Earthquake, IRS and Repo Man."
1,One Star Because O wasn't an option!,I could only load two out of the three disks and the main disk wasn't able to load after two attempts. I am going to return the product.
2,not good,"This could have been a nice typing program except for the fact that it needs to access the CD frequently. Everytime it accesses the CD, the program stalls so that when you are typing, the letters don't appear on the screen. When you re-type the letters, the previous letters would then appear, resulting in redundancy which counts as typos. It gets frustrating."
4,Too bad it's marketed as horror.,"Anyone picking up this book looking for something like Stephen King or Dean Koontz will likely be disappointed. While the novel does involve supernatural elements, they are muted for much of its length - suggestive rather than in-your-face. Reading it, I was continually reminded of the work of John Cowper Powys - particularly A GLASTONBURY ROMANCE. The characters and setting are beautifully realized, and Rickman's writing is fluid without ever descending to the pap that constitutes most popular writing. It's been awhile since I've enjoyed a novel as much as I did this one, and I immediately purchased more of his work. Just don't expect Clive Barker."
1,Worst Of Rod,"This is one of the worst albums of Rod I have heard, sounds like it is a compilation of old songs left in the studio and were just publish to bring in some dough!"
2,A laborious read,"An impeccably researched book which covers in detail the political history of this turbulent and exciting period. However the writing is laboured, and the illustrations and maps are quite inadequate to illustrate the complexity of the text."
4,Guilt-free Help with Adult ADD,"Many adult ADD self-help books claim the ""you're not damaged, you're just different"" philosophy -- and then proceed to prescribe ways to ""fix your problem"" with conventional time management and organizing methods. Fortunately, Weiss's approach is more creative, constructive, and strengthening. The author's tone reflects an acceptance of what's generally pathologized and ""handled"" as a limiting or disabling condition. Noting both strengths and challenges, Weiss succinctly covers many different areas affected by adult ADD, also acknowledging some of the underlying personality issues and emotional aspects. These plusses more than outweigh the inevitable and relatively innocuous happy-talk/pop-psych quotient. I was diagnosed last year, and have taken a great deal of useful support from the book."
1,Most frustrating book I've ever tried to read,"If I didn't know better, I'd believe this book some sort of prank aimed at those of us with ADD or ADHD.View from the Cliff made me want to jump! I found it extremely hard to track the flow of the marginal information presented, and sadly, the overall writing skill of the author is questionable. I myself have adult ADD and I write advertising copy for a living. I know that it's possible to have ADD and to also organize information in a readable, informative, and (dare I say) interesting way. This book misses the mark by an amazingly wide margin. I found myself getting angry only 5 minutes into the read and my hopes of finding valuable tips for dealing with the challenges of how my brain is wired were disappointed. See other one star reviews for specific details."
1,Hated it.,"I couldn't get through more than one page at a time, if that! This is not a practical guide for managing ADHD issues in your life: it's for those that need or are seeking something closer to spiritual or emotional understanding of themselves. She is always saying embrace your sensitivity... if you already know it's okay to feel what you feel or are not into mushy oprah-esque writing, skip this! It was definitely a waste of money for me."
3,"Well written, but goes nowhere","I wasn't aware of some of the history that is outlined in this book, and I found it interesting. However, Mr. Wheeler uses his characters as vehicles to illustrate that history, and fails to develop them fully. He disposes of characters - even main characters - on a whim, and starts up story lines only to abandon them for no obvious purpose. He keeps other main characters around for no good reason, and has them tell their stories over and over. I arrived at the end of the book feeling disappointed and somewhat cheated."
2,Not for liquids - beware,"I have been using these bags for years (4 or 5) to store milk. In the distant past, I could use these 4 or 5 times, and then they would leak, which was okay, because I always used these ""old"" bags as a back-up. Now, I use two BRAND NEW BAGS, and they BOTH leak. I have to throw them out after one use because they both leak. I now know to put the bags in a large bowl in the fridge to thaw it out because they are going to leak. It's a total mess trying to pour the liquie (in TWO bags, both leaking) into a bottle. I bought these in bulk - I'm not sure when the company sold out and started selling an inferior product. But don't expect the air-tight liquid storing capabilities you see on the commercials where they put the liquid in and turn it upside down. If they held it there long enough, it would start dripping (and make a mess in your kitchen, slowly, while you are not watching!)"
2,Glad Zipper Freezer Bags,"BEWARE: Even though the label says: ""Glad Zipper Freezer Bags"", these do NOT have a Zipper. If you want the Ziplock Bags with an actual Zipper, you need to look for ""Ziplock Easy Zipper"". Other than that, they are regular bags."
1,Beware the catchy title: Does not relieve any guilt!,"Robert Jeffress' book, Guilt Free Living, is nothing more than a list of DOs and DON'Ts that fall short of helping anyone who already has such lists, but is always fealing guilty he or she isn't doing them all. (Isn't that why you'd buy a book with this title?) It's as if Jeffrey first wrote a typical Christian book, with various topics, from Time Management, to Child Rearing, to Money Management, in the typical DOs and DON'Ts style, then realized, ""Whoa! What a load I'm laying on people - it's just gonna make them feel guilty... I know, I'll sprinkle in the idea that doing these Biblical things, and shunning anything not on this list, will make you guilt-free. Why, 'guilt-free' is so catchy, I think I'll put it in the title!"" Well, the book may contain sound, Biblical DOs and DON'Ts, but that's hardly what I needed."
4,Birthday favor,We bought 12 of these to be birthday favors for my 2 year-old's party and tied a lollypop to one of the bear's hands. The kids loved them. How can you not like beanie babies?
1,"A Legal ""Snuff"" Film...","Although in obvious pain and near death, Nick is badgered and filmed in what should have been private moments with the people closest to him or not, at their descretion. Any ""stranger"" who gets pleasure out of watching an elderly man who is in the last stages of Cancer and counting his remaining minutes should evaluate their interest in the macabe.I felt there is enough evidence of Elder Abuse to put the director and crew away for the prodding and torture they put Nick through to make this poorly made documentary. Had the dying man been payed by an actor, I might have been interested.Watching the actual terminally ill person die was NOT entertainment. What's next... cameras in Hospices to film group sorrow and death?"
4,Missing some of the best,I really would like to give this CD five stars but unfortunately it is missing some of the older songs that were good songs such as Hyper Hyper. All around a good CD though.
4,good compilation,"If you've already own a Scooter album, I would not bother getting this. I think in every Scooter album there's at least one song which really ""rocks""--I am your pusher and How much is the fish are some examples. However, I think, all their songs sound the same, more or less. If you are looking for your first Scooter album definitely get this. If you are not familiar with Scooter, I would describe it as high energy, 170BPM, German-techno with cheesy lyrics. For some reason, they just make really fun music to listen to. They're neither inventive, experimental nor that talented. But they know how to captivate the listener with the using high and low tempo contrast in their songs (making them almost anthem-like)."
5,Physan 20,Product arrived in a timely manner. I have used this product many times on my orchids to cure and prevent fungus. Definitly a must have for the orchid grower.Physan 20
4,Economical wheel to make driving games more fun,"For the price, this wheel is an easy way to make driving games more fun. It has fairly good response but don't expect it to operate like a real automobile. Neither the wheel or peddles (gas/break) are as remotely sensitive as a real car but this is after all, just a gaming device and it gets the job done. The software loads easily and works on Windows XP right off the CD. It is also recognized by older software versions like Need For Speed II.The one caveat is that you should have a flat, fairly smooth surface on which to mount the wheel and you should fasten it on tightly because if you don't, the wheel easily dislodges during the middle of the game and ruins your run."
4,It take a little getting used to.....,"Okay, so the pedals don't feel like real automobile pedals. It's a gaming device, people! I'm looking for realism plus fun, and that's what I got. True, it does take a considerable amount of practice to get used to it. Especially if, like me, you've spent years mashing keyboard buttons to play driving games. I'ts a LOT harder using the wheel and pedals, but a heck of a lot more fun! To answer Pedro Couto e Santo's question in his earlier review: 'So... what's the point to buying a steering wheel and pedals if you can actually play driving games better on your keyboard?'. The answer is you can't play driving games with the wheel and pedals the same way you play with the keyboard. You have to re-learn everything. Have fun with your re-education!"
4,Budget goodness.,"Smooth, fairly well designed, it's definitely better than a joystick for driving games."
2,Logitech WingMan Formula GP Racing Wheel -USB,ILogitech WingMan Formula GP Racing Wheel -USBI WAS HAPPY WITH IT THANKS
1,cannot download,"I purchased the movie, but am unable to download it on any device that I own, including several kindles and an Iphone and Ipad."
4,SAVE $ !,"My Wife loves to talk to her family back East.(We live on the West Coast.)Just the thought of the phone bill was enough to make me sick. This phone, while a little hard to set up the Long Distance Manager, saved us over $100.00. I am sold, this phone has already more than paid for itself."
4,Good Phone,"I had an AT&T cordless phone and had to take it back because it sounded horrible and bought this phone. It sounds good, has caller ID, and is affordable"
1,My cell phone sounds better,"This is the worst phone I have ever used. It looks nice, but the first five people I called asked me if I was on my cell phone. My boss called and jokingly said he would give me more money to get a better phone so he wouldn't have to talk to me on this one. I'm sending it right back."
3,"Good bargain, but lousy battery life","I am pleased with every aspect of this phone except for the fact that it dies way too quickly after being left off the cradle. I've been in many conversations where i've had 10 seconds warning before the thing dies and I have to quick switch phones or lose the person I'm talking to. But still, for a 900MHz phone with this kind of display and features (I never use the Long Distance Manager), the price couldn't be beat. No regrets, really!"
4,Troubled Water,"This book is an excellent introduction to the issues surrounding water in the world. It explores it's exploitation as well as other issues such as pollution and availability. It is beautifully packaged and illustrated, and the variety of essays from different people provides a wide view. My only criticism is that it is a little too basic. It seems to introduce a topic and then just as you are getting interested in it and want to learn more, it moves on to a new issue. However this is a good springboard to other books in this genre and an attractive all round package.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
1,It's good to have money,"Anita Roddick proves that if you have enough money you can publish your own propoganda in shiny little books.This is not a serious discussion of water issues. It's the usual socialist garbage Roddick wants to apply to others, but not herself.Unless you're an unusually gullible fourth grader, this book has nothing to offer."
1,For water ignorants,"This book could well be termed Water 101, but if you have been interested in water for more than a day, it is likely you already know more than what is inside. Besides, the information is poorly displayed in my opinion."
2,Recommended ONLY for the neophyte,"If you have read the information included in the ""Peel Slowly and See"" box set, you have more information than is included in this book. Reading like someting I would have written in High School or in my early college days, this mini book is a major disappointment. A handful of quotes from VU fan mags and the above mentioned ""Peel Slowly..."" booklet, doesn't a good book make.Avoid unless you have never read anything about the VU."
3,Eh,"Seems to have been written by a 14 year old.Offers fairly thorough backstory to the production of the album, but the author is clearly a developing writer. Overall this is probably the least impressive 33 1/3 release I've read ='(((((((((((((((((((7778HJ"
1,Worthless,"This represents the absolute worst in rock journalism: the writing style is out of a high school term paper, and it includes no new information about the band or the album. Don't waste your time on this."
2,Looks can be oh so deceiving ...,"I really liked this canister/water bottle; however, it cracked at the based shortly after I got it, so I had to throw it out. With that, to anyone thinking of purchasing it, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"
4,Awesome,"I've had mine for about 6 years or mor and it's awesome for almost any game. The buttons are fully customizable, they set up for almost any combination of key commands and have a selector switch for easy profile switching. It also has a 0n-the-fly record button. If you're into FPSs or RPGs this controller is almost a must. The only drawbacks I've had with it are a couple buttons breaking from continuous use and it's not compatible with XP 64bit yet."
1,"Worthless, or next to it.","I've read numerous computer books, but this one is the worst, or next to worthless for someone trying to learn how to use Ethereal, now Wireshark. I don't know how the people who wrote this book can sleep at night - no kidding."
2,Already out of date,"While this is an interesting book, its problem is that it is already out of date. It seems that it was written at a time when the user interface was undergoing lots of churn.For example, on page 47, figure 2.1 is out of date, as the menu items have changed and the toolbar now has more items.On Page 146 and 147 the authors attempted to deal with changes in the GUI, and show us what the new print dialog box will look like, however, that version is also out of date.On Page 153, Figure 4.19 is out of date. On Page 155, Figure 4.21 no longer exists. Page 156, Figure 4.22 is out of date. Page 162, Figure 4.31 is out of date, and so on.Further on, Page 180, Figures 4.49 and 4.50 are also out of date, and it would have been nicer to show some real-life examples of problems one can spot with the Time Sequence Graphs and some explanation of how socket layer stuff relates to what you might see on the wire.So, I am not sure this book is worth buying. Perhaps wait for the update."
1,One of two units defective,"One of two units was defective upon receipt. We have mailed it back (they don't pay postage) at our expense but after several weeks, have not yet received our replacement. The working unit is fine."
2,"In this case....it's clearly ""NOT""","I love krokus, and this is a pretty lame release. If you wanna hear Krokus at their best, check out ""One Vice At A Time"" or ""Hardware."" Even their 2010 release ""Hoodoo"" is better than this weak offering.....but I still love 'em."
4,A(Fun!) Pop-Up Book For Grownups,"I have always loved pop-up books and this one is no exception. Each page has an interesting new surprize. The illustrations are bright and well-rendered. The only quibble I have is that the ladies are a bit tricky to set up. In other words,be gentle or you might rip them a tiny bit(yes,it happened to me.) This book would make a lovely gift for anyone who enjoys fashion and or novelty books.."
1,Don't waste your money on this poorly engineered book!,"I just received this book and was thoroughly disappointed being a fan of pop-up books and Isabelle de Borchgrave for her life size dress creations made entirely of paper. I have several Robert Sabuda books, like ""Peter Pan"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", and my others which serve as excellent examples of pop up book artistry and engineering. This book has very faulty engineering, lacks imagination, and none of the images actually ""pop out"" at you. You are left trying to delicately detach odds and ends, like flimsy paper dolls, and feeling taken for the high price of this book. I would strongly recommend you pass on this so called ""pop up""."
3,Better soap elsewhere,"This is a good soap but I have found that you can get a better lathering soap WITH scents and colors that remedies the same ailments (psorisis, poison ivy, acne, etc) through Bare Necessity Soaps on line."
1,I have eczema and this didn't help,"I've been using this soap every time I shower since I received it. I have struggled with eczema all my life. I use unscented shampoo, hypoallergenic detergent, Cetaphil, etc. I thought it would try Lye soap because of the rave reviews and seeing that the winter cold is here I wanted something that will sooth my dry skin.I must say, I haven't seen any benefits yet. If anything, my eczema is worse after I shower. It started with slight red skin on the inside of my elbows after the first use, now after my most recent shower using Lye my inner elbows are blazingly red/ irritated. This hasn't happened since my last accident wearing a sweatshirt that was washed with scented detergent. Maybe it works for some people, but it did not work for me."
3,Grandmas Lye Soap,"I bought this soap at the Health Food Store to try for my daughters eczema. It didn't seem to phase it at all and it has a pretty nasty smell. But, I have been using it on my face and I do think it has helped clear it up. I do have to hold my breath the whole time though or it will almost make me gag."
5,Grandma's Lye Soap from Remwood Product Co.,"My 9 yr old son and I both suffer with moderate to severe breakouts of eczema, and ""Granndma's Lye Soap"" has been our ""saving grace""! My husband stumbled upon this soap by shear coincidence in a neighberhood store near his job. I tried it, and I must say that I love it! So I searched for it on Amazon.com and found Remwood Products Co. I would recommend it to anyone who suffers w/the symptoms associated w/eczema and acne as well. It will also leave your skin w/that ""squeaky-clean"" feeling, yet soft and supple. Remwood Products Co. also has the best unit price on-line for this soap, so please place your orders w/them."
5,Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!,"In just 3 days, I noticed a significant difference in my skin!! I'll NEVER go back to any other soap, ugh! I no longer need lotions, acne face wash or foundation. That's right! I've been using this soap for only two weeks and it has fully restored my skin to the point that I don't even need foundation. I can't be happier!"
1,Poor interface and awful sound,"This program is terrible. The music during the phonics section is too loud and it is difficult to hear the pronunciation of the letters. The games either shove the user through w/o learning or the interface is so difficult that your child wont be able to figure out what the game wants. As for the ""satisfaction guarantee"" that is on the box it doesnt include shipping so you'll be out 25% of your purchase price or worse. AVOID!"
4,Very friendly service,"Ordered this as a gift and it's a pretty cute and very different item. What I'm really going to boast about, however, is the customer service. The original wouldn't open, so I emailed the company asking for any advice on how to fix it. Without any more questions or run-around, they asked me to ship it back and they'd send a replacement. Which they did in a very timely manner. I really appreciate how simple the transaction was and the speed at which they got me the replacement.I only rate the PRODUCT at 4 stars because of the fact that it needed replaced. I feel that these should be better tested when coming off the assembly line."
4,THE NEW FACE IN CHILL-OUT!!,"Beautiful...classy...stunning...therapeutic...relaxing...groovy...reflective...nostalgic...dreamy...sophisticated...sultry...exotic...stylish...and melancholy--these words sum up Arkestra One's very impressive debut CD on the ESL record label--Thievery Corporation's label for those of you who didn't know. Although some will find this CD a bit slow and meandering at times, it's absolutely perfect for those late night encounters and rainy days where you're just chillin' at home. Throw it in with Goldfrapp's ""Felt Mountain"" and Alpha's ""Stargazing"" and you've got a head-trip to remember."
5,We Broke the Rules is da bomb!!!,"This cd by Aventura is my fav cd is it sooooooooooo good all the songs are great especially Obssesion remix, nueve y quince, i belive , y todavia me amas, and amor de madre. This cd rulz i recommend everyone to get it they have the best bachata in the whole world. Viva Aventura!!!"
3,"""I'm not a prostitute but I could give you what you want!""","Someone tried to make me listen to this CD, so in the style of Zoe Wanamaker in the Harry Potter movie, I screamed and dived sideways. Unfortunately, someone had left the window open, and I plummeted to my death.I find Aventura to be on the whole a very sexiful group, offering a variety of hotties from different ethnicities, and as Missy Elliott said, ""Boys, boys, all kinds of boys! Black, White, Puerto Rican, Chinese boys!"" before unfortunately becoming stuck in her harness at the MTV music video awards!This item is a very good book, and is probably the worst I have ever read. It is preferable to read it outside, but I'm inside."
4,bachata lover,This album is so awesome. They way these newyoricans combine pop music and bachata is great. I am absolutely in love with this album. It is a must have.
1,WHATTA IN THA WORLD IS THIS?,"Da brat you sound so POP!, it's so wrong, way far from what she used to deliver, this song is bad, bad, bad.....sorry, she used to be saussy, now she nauseous.....I buy it , because it was a cd single but I don't listen to it anymore, just heard it once or twice......"
3,no sound,We bought ours for christmas and there really is no major problem with the unit except I cannot hear the speakers that sit on either side of you in the back The sound is really loud in the front but hear nothing in the back. Also The radio function is good but you cannot hear A.M radio just FM. It was a good price and I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Ehhh...,"I found Sor Juana dull the first time I read her 'Responce' and even more dull when I reread it. She is very good at being subtle though, and alot of the time its what shes not saying that makes you think, I don't know if it was the translators fault, or what, but I just didn't enjoy it. But her poetry was beautifully translated in this edition."
3,nice,"Plastic stakes aren't good for my rocky soil and a top blew off in the wind, but they light up nice and improve the walkway."
5,The Best Ever,"These are by far the best solar powered lights I've seen. I've been buying solar lights since 2001 when I first saw them. For the most part, the problem with solars is the suceptibility to sunhine.These Soho's have acrylic globes on them which should last for many years. The top shade is real stainless steel that will last forever. The light is TWO LEDs that put out a lot of light and stay on until morning. Nice Stuff!!"""
5,Provocative and sophisticated,"I felt like I needed to write a review to counter the last (and only) one. Not that the author is wrong, just that art is a matter of personal taste.Not all art is about beauty -- a lot of it is about expressing other things and provoking other emotions besides enjoyment of beauty. The images in this book are sophisticated and have a very wide range of expression. I was in awe of this great selection of artworks. I would say gorgeous, amazing stuff.I liked this book enough to buy a second copy, and everyone I have showed it to has found it breathtaking."
5,500 Figures in Clay,"A superb book, with 500 pictures of fabulous ceramic sculpture,and no text. I first took this book out of the library,several times.I finally bought it ! I realized I'd need months, maybe years, to study and be inspired by the artwork."
4,500 figures in clay,A excellent book showing what artists have done. enjoyable to look through again and again
2,500 figures in clay,"I have most of the 500 series and have been very please with the variety of artists and styles that were covered. This particular title should have been ""Artists celebrate the anguish of the human form"". The majority of work illustrates very tortured forms and very few made me want to celebrate.I can appreciate the diversity of techniques and interpretations covered in the book, but it is heavily biased toward the disfigured and tortured. A few more celebrated forms would have made the book more balanced - as the other 500 series have been."
1,500 figures in Clay: Ceramic Artists Celebrate the Human Form (A Lark Ceramics Book),"My low score for this book is primarily, but not exclusively, a low score for the judging. I find it difficult to believe that almost no work in the classical tradition was submitted. The work in these pages contained almost no work of a traditional figurative nature. Both in galleries in the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as at art shows/faires, there is plenty of traditional figurative work being done now in clay and bronze. I can only conclude that the judges hold a strong bias for non-traditional work.There is also an alarming gap between what I will term ""high end art"" and mediocre. It's pretty obvious who the former are (e.g., Violet Frey, Beth Cavener Stichter); there are all too many in the latter category.It may be that your ""call"" for art went out to a limited audience (to university art departments and art schools, perhaps?) and failed to capture the attention of more professional artists."
1,don't like this at all,"This book is very disappointing.It is as if they found all the disturbing, creepy figures they could find and put them in a book. There are probably a handful of beautiful figures and that is it!I have 500 bowls, 500 teapots and 500 cups and love each of these books, they are all fantastic, this ,500 figures, quite frankly sucks!Don't waste your money on this book, buy one of the other ""500"" books, they are superb!"
2,500 figures in clay,"without being able to review the illustrations in the book, I was unable to make good use of the models for my beginning sculpting projects. The cover picture seemed somewhat simple, but the many complex figures contained in the book were too difficult to be models for my limited ability."
1,"Magic American 406PK Tub & Wall 1-5/8"" x 11"" White",It didn't stick as well as I had hoped it would. It actually buckled and came up the next day. I would NOT recommend it!
2,Lancea Sanctum adds too little.,"Lancea Sanctum presents the religious Covenant of vampires dedicated to preying on humanity and fulfilling the role God has chosen for them. A lot of detail is presented on the structure of the Lancea Sanctum, from the role a typical ancillae plays to how the Covenant relates to other World of Darkness entities. Factions, Bloodlines, Disciplines, and new Thebean Sorcery rituals are included to add mechanical support to this broad take on one of the oldest vampiric organizations.Unfortunately, Lancea Sanctum speaks far too much in vague generalities and adds little new and interesting material to this Covenant. The rites, prayers, and roles observed by members are simplistic modifications of existing church roles that any Storyteller could easily invent. The history of the Covenant starts out interesting, but quickly degrades into a historical survey of questionable use. Finally, the new game mechanics (Bloodlines, Disciplines, etc.) are sparse and largely flavorless."
3,"A nice book, but lacking....","I think the Sheffermans have wonderful writing skills in thier magazine, but it somehow doesn't work in a book. I found the book a nice addition to my collection of ferret books, as well as pretty enjoyable to read once through. I just felt it was a little lacking in depth for a ferret book. It's a good begginer book, but I think anyone with many years of ferret experience wouldn't find this book as helpful or appealing."
4,bachmann two-story house,"I like this house. The front of it looks like my house. It did require a little glue, but after all, it is a kit. It is very cute when put together and it was a very relaxing project but did take some patience. I may get another one just like it and paint it the same color as my house."
2,some tape required,"The finished product looks nice enough, but anyone who wants it to hold any semblance of shape needs to use tape at the very least. Trying to put it together without tape only served to create the urge to set the model on fire so as to give the fire station model a greater role."
3,Not Singh's Best Work,"This book isn't Tara Singh's best work - it tends to be a little less thought provoking and a lot more ""directed"" - particularly when dealing with the role of ACIM in your family relationships. Having said that, Singh is a great aid to understanding and living the course, and this book, when taken as part of his whole body of work, should be read by the serious student."
3,"Ohhh, Umberto, what have you done?","There's probably a point to this whole sprawling mess of a book, but for the life of me I didn't get it. After such undisputed masterpieces of 'The Name Of The Rose' (one of my top ten favourite books of all time) and that other one about the pendulum and the templars and stuff, you know, the one with Foucault in it, this is a bigger letdown than something that really lets you down a whole lot. I thought 'Island Of The Day Before' was just Eco's experimental diversion into forgetting how to write a decent book, but he appears to have adopted boring as a philosophy for his life, and it shows here, between the covers of this book. Nothing even *happened*. I got to the end and my girlfriend was all ""Well, what happened?"" and all I could do was sit there, not speaking to her, being very very quiet."
3,Ultimately Unsatisfying,"This was the first (and so far only) work of Umberto Eco I have read and it ultimately lost my interest. I am loath to put a book down without finishing it, but this was a rare exception for me. I really enjoyed the story when it focused on the growth of the Italian city-states and when Eco focused our attention on the emergent Alessandria, but as the story continued and Eco left this behind to delve into the quest for the Holy Grail and the Kingdom of Prester John the book just lost my interest. It's well written and the characters are well developed, the plot was just too scattered across theology, mythology, the Sack of Constantinople, and the Italian city-states for my taste."
4,Good in the end.,"I'll say that at first I hated this book. I thought many times of giving up and moving on to another one, but I bought it, and I figured that since I paid money for it I might as well read it all the way through.I'm really glad I didn't give up because the second half of Baudolino is really the better half. The first half was so boring and seemingly unnecessary and long-winded. In the second half it really picks up speed and comes together nicely. If you have the patience, I would really recommend this. Despite the heavy handed philosophical diatribe that sometimes clogs up the pace of the story, it really is one of Eco's more accessible books. And it has a nice ending that I wasn't expecting. An Eco for beginners I guess."
4,A Great Novel of Medieval Intrigue,"If you have at least some background in medieval history, you will be able to get through Baudolino without too much trouble. If not, you will no doubt find this book esoteric, dense and impenetrable.In a beseiged Constantinople in 1453, a wealthy man takes a grizzled con artist named Baudolino, into his home - a con artist who may or may not have been an advisor of the great Frederick Barbarossa, witha grand tale of a manic quest for the mythical priest-king Prester John. One is never sure of whether Baudolino is telling the truth, but in the end, it doesn't matter, as truth and falsehood seem to collapse into reality and Baudolino's most fantastic yarns earn verisimilitude. Along the way, we meet and come to love Baudolino's rag-tag group of lifelong friends who travel with him to the ends of the earth. A complex read, but for fans of Eco or intellectual thrillers, one that will prove satisfying and enjoyable."
4,Really is two books,"As a fan of historical fiction I really like the first 25 chapters, especialy the alternative history of Emperor Ferdericks demise and the sacking of Constantinople. However after Baudolino leaves Armenia and enters the unknown land it turns in a fantasy book ala The Lord of The Rings. In the end the book returns to historical fiction for a great ending. However my struggle to get through the fantasy sections was as hard as Baudolino's search for the Kingdom of Prester John."
4,Gripping,"Umberto Eco is, in my openion, almost without compare as teh literati of the historical epic. Baudolino does not compare to his other works; however, little does. Truth or dilusion . . . what is a lie, and what is reality. Bravo for Baudolino."
4,Can you hear this eco?,"a richly articulated and thoroughly descriptive adventure that ultimately did not hold my attention as much as the others (Rose/Pendulum/Island) did. I'm not sure if Eco simply blew me away or put me to sleep with this one. Either way, I'd rather read anything from this master before 90% of the rest of contemporary writers. What is lacking in the dynamic/excitement category is more than made up for by Eco's eloquent and powerfully written prose that proves elegant and enriching."
3,History made fun... and frustrating,"This is actually a novelization of Umberto Eco's essays in Serendipities, as most of the ideas here are present in the aforementioned book. Mr. Eco is in top form here, mixing history, comedy and wordplay but also, his penchant for obscure facts and dense writing are also part of the package. The novel starts out fast enough for an Eco book. The title character who seemed to be inspired by Baron Munchausen, and his cohorts seem like interesting people, the kind you would want to have drinks with in a pub or tavern somewhere. However, things bog down when Baudolino and friends embark on their search for Prester John. Yes, it's vividly written but there are lots of idle conversation that the story suddenly plods along. In fairness, it helps in conveying the idleness and the slow passage of time the characters experience. It's a fun medieval story but I still think The Name Of The Rose is still the best Eco work."
5,A fine story of change and discovery,"Set in 1204 in the kingdom of Byzantine, this tells of Baudolino, who saves several from death at the hands of crusading warriors through Constantinople, and whose gifts for learning languages and telling tall tales earns him a journey in search of a legendary priest-king in a mysterious land. A fine story of change and discovery set against a believable historical backdrop."
4,Entertaining and rich in thought,"I was surprised to read the disappointment in the other reviews. I felt that this book was classic Eco. It is not only an entertaining romp through a curious period of medieval history, with a would-be Forrest Gump - Baudolino, in his confabulations, would have us believe he was equally fortuitous in his own actions and encounters. Baudolino is also a philosophical discussion of truth, belief, and history. We should never expect a simple story from a professor of Semiotics, and Eco does not disappoint. As we enter a period as curious for its religious beliefs (religious relics, saints etc) as for its the peculiar necessity of reconstructing its history often out of very thin air, we are treated to a fascination meditation on how greatly belief dictates what is truth....at least for the believer. I found Baudolino entertaining and enlightening on a number of levels, which often is the defining characteristic of a truly great work."
4,Good place to start reading Eco,"Of the four Eco books I've read (Name of the Rose, Foucault's Pendulum, Island of the Day Before, Baudolino) this is the most accessible and so it's a good place to start reading Eco and get a sense of his style of writing. What I liked most about this book is that (and I can say this without spoiling the plot!) because Baudolino states at the outset that he is a liar, the reader has to interpret the truth of the text as the story unfolds. This extends the book beyond the usual one-dimensional reading of fiction. If you like books to be bigger in this way then Eco is your man, and I'd also recommend Milorad Pavic. But let's not get carried away, here's a good place to start!"
3,A bit of a struggle...,"This book is the life story of Baudolino as told by the title character. It should be noted that Baudolino is a great story teller and a known liar. As Eco ties in many historical and fantasy figures into Baudolino's life the reader is never sure what is the truth and what is not. As a whole the story was great. Having never read one of Eco's books before I was not sure what I was getting into. I found parts of the story a struggle to get through. However, the book was worth sticking to and the ending was very good. If you are a fan of Eco's books you will enjoy this story. If you have never read one of Eco's book I do not think I would recommend this as a first taste."
2,"Never dull, but just too long","This book contains an interesting, but never really captivating story. All concepts that make this book worth reading are already present in the first third of the book. Subsequent developments are in line with the story, but I felt little value was added for most of the middle part of the book. Only in the very end, the pace picks up again into a dramatic conclusion.If the book had been one third the size, I would have enjoyed reading it to the end. Now it just felt like a burden to complete it."
2,Faith makes things become true,"Baudolino utters this remark 400 pages into this 500-page anything-but-a-quick-read. You kind of wish Eco had spared us the history and mythology surrounding Baudolino's life by mentioning this a little sooner.This book is a chore. Some of the history is interesting, but the overriding themes about false faith and effort in vain make the reader question the task of plowing through the book.If you're a big history buff, there might be enough in here to keep you interested. However, if you liked Eco's Name of The Rose and you're hoping this will be as good, forget it and pass this one over."
4,A Wonder of Historical Fantasy,"This is a book for the lover of literary fiction. For one who can appreciate an alternative story for an historical event, as well as fantastical stories about faraway lands, and creatures whose faces are in their torsos. Eco is likely one of the most learned of contemporary writers and the encyclopedic historical detail he puts into his novels and non-fiction prose bears witness to this fact. In Baudolino, a self-professed liar tells the story of his life in a burning city. Raised by King Frederick; educated in France; pilgram to the kingdom of Prester John, Baudolino tells his story such that we want it all to be true. But we are sure it is not.That's all i have to say. Enjoy."
1,Avoid this book at all costs,"Baudolino is an incredibly boring book. I loved ""Name of the Rose"" and had high hopes for this novel, but it was a colossal disappointment. The book meanders hopelessly for 500 pages and lacks any suspense whatsoever. It took 3 attempts to actually finish the novel. The first time, I read to page 200 and desisted. I then waited 2 years and made it to page 400, but stopped reading due to shear boredom. I then waited 6-months and read the final 100 pages. I have read close to 2,000 books and this is one of the 20 most boring books I have ever encountered in my lifetime. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO READ THIS NOVEL unless your are an insomniac that requires a sleeping aid. Reading this book is the equivalent of watching paint dry or grass grow. Baudolino is boredom at its finest!"
2,It got an extra star for being about history,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Also it's my first Uberto Eco book. I had high hopes of Eco as I had heard that he's a linguistics professor. There is always a possibility that it was the translator who made this book read with the fluency of a Dick and Jane novel. Either way, now I would have a really hard time reading another Eco book. The other reviewers make me feel that perhaps I might appreciate his other books. It would be hard to open another Eco book though. I admit I kind of feel a grudge against him for writing this book. I can actually forgive the tedious personality of Baudolino, it's the lowest common denominator writing style that really made this an unfortunate reading experience for me."
2,Baudolino is tedious,"Page after page of Eco spinning his wheels, never really saying anything. Every sentence pokes fun at something. Baudolino reminds me of Catch-22; both make you laugh, and after 500 hundred pages of the same jokes over and over you get tired. I started putting it down for a week every once in a while, and I never missed it. When I picked it back up again it was always amusing for the first day, then I would get bored again.The novel is tedious. Zero stars for readability.You do learn a little about the history of language, and Eco does an excellent job of making you feel like you relate to, humans living in the 12th-13th century. 2 pity stars.Read Calvino if you are looking for a contemporary Italian novelist with fascinating prose and something to say."
2,This book is for Italian History buffs...,"I'm still wading through the book, but I have to agree with the gentleman who said that this story is tedious, because it is. I'm not really engaged in the character Baudolino. I could care less what happens to him. The setting feels incomplete. I don't have a good picture of where the characters are at any point in time. I think that fans of Italian or Middle Age history may enjoy this more as it seems to reference a lot of history that I am not well-versed in. It makes for a good book to put me to sleep every night, however."
3,A Waiting Game,"Not Diana Palmer's best work, which I suppose is acceptable since it was an early work. The heroine, who has become successful after leaving Georgia, returns home to strut her stuff and try to impress the one she thought she loved in her youth. Reality proves that the object of her affection is unworthy of her time or emotions, but she keeps trying to figure out if she wants him... With wishy-washy emotions and a desire to either impress or get revenge (sometimes it is difficult to tell), Keena does not exemplify the strong female characters Palmer demonstrates in later works. Reading this book, however, gives one an idea of how Palmer found her working formula, which she successfully implements in most of her future books."
4,A Hard To Find Diana Palmer(Blayne) Book,"This was originally a Candlelight Ecstacy book released about 20 or so yrs ago.This is also a VERY HARD to find book.Fortunately,Amazon has it.Palmer wrote about 4 Candlelight books under the name Diana Blayne."
3,shredding the fretboard,"this music is not the most accessible stuff, but i'm not sure i've ever heard someone shred the fretboard the way this guy does--it's some of the most insane and unbridled playing i've ever heard. pure high-octane flurries."
4,Good,"wel like it talks about the ancient romans, cretans, celts, sumerians and all that and what they beleived in and how they worshipped the gods and cast spells nd stuff and it has diffrent spell sections ( romance, fertility,divination etc.) , and she written the spells just liek the anicients did, but she modernize it a little bit so we can use them. the tools are not hard to fine either u most likely can fin it around ur house. also each spell calls upon a god for assintance and all that but before the spell she talks a little about the god involved in the spell and what the anicients did and stuff like that..then she goes on to the spell, its basically an ancient spell book modernized in a way were we can subsitute some things instead of usuing a sword (if u dont have one) use a ritual knife or a good quality knife etc.. its pretty good book :), whew"
3,Review,"I just received this book and have read it cover to cover for two days. The History is Very Interesting, it explains where all these different gods and goddesees are dervived from, and why some are mixed. It even includes a map, so you can trace your background (I did anyway).The Spells are very detailed and ask for specific things not available at Albertson's. So Have not tried any. They could work, but I don't know."
3,An 80's feel B-Grade Martial Arts Movie,"I agree with Rob Nile...this movie is not meant to be taken seriously as it is mainly made for children to watch and have a great time with the entertainment which has some costumes and strange characters of different wrestling types...kinda like a try hard WWF but martial arts orientated instead of wrestling. Keith Vitali is a great martial artist and has one fight scene in the movie.I vaguely remember watching this movie but I liked it and I plan to purchase it myself sometime soon so I can watch it again. The music is kinda gay so don't expect a good soundtrack,lol. (You'll understand what I mean when you watch the flick). The storyline is good but could've done with more spice and the acting was just average. The fight scenes show some good kicks and some good acrobatic/martial arts moves combined from Brandon Gaines."
4,I was in this movie!,"Hey! I was in this film! We spent a long hot day in 1995 shooting my fight scenes in Harrisburg,PA. I was involved in several fight scenes. Look for the guy with the braids! We had fun! Lots of butt kicking action in this one. Not much story, and the directors didn't speak english so they had to show us what to do through body language! You get the picture.....see ya!"
5,Don't blink or you'll miss me!,"Great movie. Some of the best karate/tae-kwon-do instructors in the Harrisburg area are showcased here. Especially you Marianne... pull that skirt down!If you blink, you'll miss me, but i'm in 4 scenes. I'm still wondering where my credit is."
2,Bad master,"As a swing dancer and aspiring swing DJ, I'm very disappointed with the quality of the album. The mastering, in a word, sucks. The tracks keep clipping and the first track had some especially terrible audio artifacts, though that may be just an issue with my CD. I would never DJ this, and will likely never listen to it again, because there's so many other great Ella masters out there to listen to. Don't buy this one if you're picky about sound.However, they are some great tracks, and there's no fault with Ella's singing. It's just that the mastering is bad."
2,"Move along, nothing to see here.","Before you read this book, ask yourself, ""Have I ever read anything by John Saul before?""If you answer yes, then consider asking if you're willing to part with more money to read something with the same plot formula of his other ""horror"" stories.If you answer no, you might enjoy this somewhat spooky read about a townhouse full of elderly who seem to have found the fountain of youth - literally."
4,Pretty Good!,"I read this book years ago, back in 2002, but I still remember it. Maybe it's my unexplained fear of the elderly that added to this books creepy factor, but I did enjoy this book, and found it just creepy enough!"
2,Not one of John Saul's better books,"I've read several other John Saul books, ""Faces of Fear"", ""Nathaniel"", ""Creature"" and ""Second Child"". All were not great, but entertaining.""Midnight Voices"", however, was slow and I couldn't get into the story at all. I quit the book 1/2 way through."
2,Redundant Drivel,"I've read many a John Saul book yet I have never run into this particular problem. I was bored beyond the first few chapters, I agree with the other reviewers when they made the point that Mr. Saul tried to hard to make his main character liked. Her daughter is totally forgettable and her son is an utter hellion. It was very predictable, one reason for that were the typical characters. The irate Social worker, and the gastrological challenged Detective.Not only that the actual method the spooky cronies were using to extract whatever juice from the children is never really explained. Vague descriptions gore and of the shadowy shapes that are committing these acts.All in all it was an extremely irritating (dare I say painful) book to actually finish. After closing the book I vowed to write a review so no one would make the same mistake I made in buying this book. I know Mr. Saul can do better than this."
3,OK,Somewhat interesting mystery. A little odd with the flippant main character trying too hard to be clever.
2,Roman Polanski Rip-Off,"MIDNIGHT VOICES is a rip-off of Roman Polanski's THE TENANT and ROSEMARY'S BABY, but without the edge, suspense, characters, or atmosphere. Although the technical writing is solid, it feels bland and generic, and, like a PG-13 movie, this title should be placed in the ""young adults"" section. The pace picks up a bit towards the end, but it was hard to get through the melodramatic daytime soap opera dialogue of the first two-thirds. I enjoyed reading this author when I was younger, but I guess 15 years later my taste in horror runs a little deeper and more original. Did Mr. Saul really think people wouldn't compare this with Polanski's work? He should know not to mess with perfection. Hmmm"
3,A Fun Read,"John Saul has written a scary, suspenseful gothic novel that is an easy read and entertaining. His style is close to my two other favorite gothic authors: Anne Rice & Sherry A Mauro! I enjoyed this book."
3,I would love to give this five stars,"This book was great, I mean really a pleasure to read, but Saul ends this book as he does with the Manhattan Hunt Club the same way, predictable and too fast that makes the build-up to the end somewhat cheaper when you're done reading it. Thats the bad part, the great part, however, is that this is an engaging story that is IMPOSSIBLE to put down. I'd love to give it five stars, but as I said the ending was too simple and tied up the story way too easily."
2,Never mind,"Never quite did it for me in this one. A dull read. sorry, but plodding plot did nada for this cowboy."
3,midnight nonsense,"While this book does have its creepy moments it does stretch the boundaries of belief a little too far. The story starts out nicely; a murder, a mysterious building and odd occupants but there are just too many questions left unanswered. Who was the actual killer? Why did everyone just disappear in the end? Was it all an illusion? The ending sure didn't shed much light though it did leave room for a sequel. When I was finished I thought it was pretty good and to an extent I still do; but are you really asking me to believe that a woman has just married a living corpse? Worse then that, that she made love with it and didn't realize that something was a miss? A little too much to swallow for my taste. I did enjoy the suspense though and the build up but I wish the ending would have provided more answers. I hope there is a sequel. ... This version contains three audio cassettes and is red by a single reader."
1,Waste of paper,"Midnight Voices is full of action and suspense, but only when you whip it across the room out of a fit of rage and wonder what it will hit before it lands on the floor. This book will suck the reader in at the beginning and in the end it will just suck. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this waste or else John Saul would have gotten a letter from me requesting a refund."
2,I quit reading it in frustration,"Too bad, but this book is filled with page after page of redundant text. We get it, alright? The lady is stupid and poor and there are spooky things going on. I've put the book down for now.......maybe later I will give it another go. And too, I wonder why there was no insurance for our damsel."
2,It's all been written and filmed before....nothing new here,"This book contains NOTHIONG new. EVERYTHING in it has been written TO DEATH before....in fact it borders on plagiarism the material is so incredibly over-used.....the old people who are a little too friendly and not what they seem; the drugged food; the strange things done to the drugged people in the middle of the night; the old pictures where, surprise, surprise, the people look just like all of the peole that are around now....GIVE ME A BREAK!! I have been reading Saul since The God Project and I NEVER thought he'd stoop so low as to use materieal that has been over-used SO MUCH in both books AND movies!!Pass this up, it's not worth the time. Just rent some old horror flicks and you'll see the exact same thing. What a waste of time this book was."
4,Saul - Midnight Voices,"With Midnight Voices, Saul continues the fascination with New York he introduced in his last effort, The Manhattan Hunt Club. Yet, unlike that novel and most of his output since The Blackstone Chronicles (a must-read novel), Midnight Voices is quite well done.Centering on a creepy Manhattan apartment building, Saul takes a page out of Rosemary's Baby and delivers an eerie, disturbing tale. While the plot is strong, for the most part, it was easy to predict its direction and ultimate outcome early on in the novel. In addition, Saul missed a good opportunity to expand the story to include plot lines only uncovered in the novel's epilogue. Unlike many contemporary thrillers or horror novels that run on for too long with too little substance, Saul had a lot to work with and he didn't fully utilize it all.Despite these flaws, Midnight Voices is a fast-paced, creepy thriller worth the few hours it will take readers to finish it."
2,Super Kid,"Is spooky...Is thrilling...Is eerie...No. Is Super Kid.You can read stories that you know aren't true. You can read fantasies. You can read thrilling fairy tales. But when you read a story that is nothing of the above, that could be written in half pages than is written, that has a Super Kid who can do whatever he wants in NY. Know how to go in the maze of an unknown house and can save her mother is just pathetic. This wasn't the first JS's book that I read, but if this were the first one I'd never read another book written by him.If you really like these kind of books where people is always in its youth readFountain Society by Wes Craven"
3,"Semi-Slow Pace, Not-so-great Ending","This is the sixth John Saul novel I have read, and I would have to say this is my least favorite. Why? The pace of the story is good but can be slow at times. Never once did the book have me hooked. About the last fifty pages, it got VERY exciting but was turned down but the rushed ending."
5,It is too good to be a fiction,"John Saul did it again. Midnight Voices is the story about a widow in New York City is struggling to raise two of her children and the thrill starts when she remarried.With the connection of her best friend and neighbor girl death, she and her children feel some kind of strange that the people from the same building where she live with her new husband are paying too much attention to them.New husband's closed study room, the son's story about old pictures and neigbors strange attitudes make her eager to know more about history of the building where she stays currently.Unable to stop reading it because the book give you a lot of excitements"
2,Simply Awful,"I was not very entertained. The story was thin and predictable. The characters, especially the little boy, were unrealistic and unruly. If I rewrote the story, first I'd kill off the boy, he's a little brat. I thought the book lacked any common sense and depth. Awful..."
1,Where's the beef?,"New York City is a pretty exciting place, so I imagined, when I bought this book, that I would be reading a pretty exciting book. After all, it was written by the former Police Commissioner, Howard Safir. And, while Safir was already out of office when the tragedy of Sept. 11 occurred, he was there during the Amadou Diallo and Abner Louima cases. That's essentially why I decided to read this book, to find out what Safir was thinking during all that chaos. To my great disappointment, he didn't tell us much. In fact, throughout the entire book, there is very little feel for the man Safir is. Perhaps he and his ghost writer weren't able to communicate or maybe Safir is just trying to forget those dark days as 'top cop'. I don't know. What I do know is, this is little more than a commercial for his new venture into homeland security. Lots of fluff, very little else. Too bad. I was hoping for more."
5,¡Grande Duke!,Esta grabación reúne a dos grandes del jazz. Se trata de una obra musical pensada como un concierto con varios movimientos. Los sonidos son realmente fascinantes.
2,Ehhh,"Some of the book made sense, I didn't care for the way he kept using his own children as ""examples"" of what the rest of the world should be doing. That was a definate turn off. Bottom line, I didn't get anything I could use for a Grad school course."
1,Kellerman should stick to novel writing,"Filled with sensational phrases (beginning with the title), this thin little book purports to be reflections on violent children. Beyond dropping a few names, Kellerman has little to add to the question of how to deal with severely troubled children. Instead, he fans the flames of fear and loathing of youthful offenders with sensationalism and rhetoric by alluding to Hitler, Butch Cassidy, and Ted Kaczynski. Maybe the readers of USA Today can find something worthwhile in this drivel, but I found Savage Spawn to be a wasted effort. Try Angry Young Men by Aaron Kipnis for some true insights into ""bad boys."""
2,meh,"He goes from extreme to extreme. His proposed solution is not only not workable, it comes very close to overzealous state intervention. There are already child abuse laws into place. To add in these other factors which may or may not create a sociopath is ripe for abuse. We need to improve the child abuse systems we already have in place. Plus, his stance on things being hopeless after around the age of ten or younger is way too extreme and not supported enough to just throw away people like trash. His zero tolerance for youthful murderers is way too draconian--there may be some who can be reformed.Also if that one boy ""Tim"" scared him so much, why can't he remember the name? Why doesn't he now go through his records to try to find it and see what happened to the child? Why didn't he alert domestic abuse authorities. There was an indication that ""Tim"" might be abusing grandma."
2,"It had its moments, but it dragged on like a 120-page essay!","This piece of writing would have been more suited as a 6-page op-ed article in a magazine or newspaper. Instead, Kellerman stretched it out into a book, and the results are less than inspiring. Although he does bring in some interesting insight and ideas, best expressed in two specific examples, he continually adresses the broader issue of psycopathy in general, instead of in children. Also, Kellerman obviously has a political agenda that includes harsh prison sentences and the belief that some people are born evil. While there is nothing wrong with these beliefs, they unfortunately affect the authors objectivity on the subject he is writing about."
5,Best condensed narrative of the British Empire under Victoria,"I thoroughly enjoyed Jan Morris' survey of the 19th century British Empire. Having studied this topic from numerous other sources and perspectives, I still found this to be a refreshing account, and one that tied numerous facets into a cohesive whole. While some might regard Morris as writing with too much of a pro-British bias, I did not find the lack of politically-correct 'empire-bashing' to be problematic. Indeed, Morris emphasizes the negative (and the ludicrous) right alongside the positive. In the few instances where the perspective is obviously skewed, the informed student of history can easily read between the lines. In short, for the curious, I recommend this as the finest single volume on this topic, both for its informative content and its exciting, engaging writing style. I look forward to reading more of Morris' works."
1,mind numbing,"I could not find the humanity. It was touted as the story of England's grandeur, but instead all I found was the underbelly: the criminals of Australia, the Afrikans, the Thugees, the disdain for all other ethnic groups and religions and the pompous and self centered desire of an entire country to ""teach them"" all how to be British. The book lacked soul."
5,"Great product, works well.","This is actually a pretty good program. I've had the program before, and I thought it was pretty cool a couple of years back. I lost it, and decided to get a replacement copy in case my computer crashed.The program might seem a bit difficult at first, but make sure to watch the tutorial; it really does help. Make sure you have some kind of USB interface, or some kind of adapter that connects to your computer. Behringer has a decent interface for like 30 bucks that you can buy on amazon. You chose the new project option, click on the transport button, select the track you want to record, and record. You can clean up your tracks, or add effects. You can't beat it for the price."
5,green solution,I had a constant rodent problem at my house and with in a month of having the PC5500 installed in 4 rooms of my house I have not seen on rodent dropping!I am so glad that I found a green solution to my rodent problem.
1,It doesn't work!,"I knew I had a mouse problem in my kitchen for several months. I placed traps all over the place and for several months I didn't catch anything. Thinking that all the mice had somehow vanished, I bought this repeller just to make sure they didn't come back. It turns out that the day afer I plugged this unit into an outlet in my kitchen, I caught three mice! I think this product may actually attract mice rather than repel them!"
5,More than just another sappy singles book,"I was first given this book by a co-worker and was pretty hesitant to read it. I thought it would just be another sappy, band-aid approach to how singles can find happiness in life. This book was much more than that. It offred a fresh, Godly approach on how to live the single life and love it. The author includes down to earth stories and relates personal events from her own life. For singles looking for more than then next cheesy ""how-to"" book in romance, I recommend this book."
5,Thanks,Thank you Mrs. Holland for writing a book that can be used by both single christian men and women. I have been charged with starting a single's ministry at my church and was excited when I found your book. I was growing weary because most 'single's' books (at least the ones I've found) are geared toward women and have a sort of a 'how to catch a man/keep a man' overtone. I was glad this book was spiritual in its applications and that it focuses on the growth of the single in all facets of his or her life not just in finding a relationship. This book is straight forward and an enjoyable read. Thanks again Mrs. Holland.
2,Kinda Okay..........,Somehow the solid handles look better than the translucent ones. Mine is not as finely finished on one side as the older red tinker that I have. I can also see signs of mild rusting inside the recess on the main blade where you insert your nail to pull out the knife. If you need to buy only one SAK in the 3.5 inch format go for the solid red handles.
1,Linksys That Couldn't Link,"After purchasing, tried to install on my computer. After installing drivers, could not get unit to communicate with my IP.Used my IP Tech Support and Linksys Tech Support with no luck.Purchased Motorola Surfboard SB4200 and it works great."
4,"Nice modem, works like a charm",This is my first broadband purchase after doing some review. I am very happy with the modem. It is really plug and play. I did have to do some configuration to setup the wired network. I have not upgraded to wireless but plan to purchase Linksys based on the modem's ease of use. I would give it 5 stars only if I owned it longer and it still runs well and if it works well with wireless.
3,linksys,product was well maintained and in great condition i just wish i had know it didnt come with any of the essential wires
2,No way to configure the modem,"I bought this new for a Comcast Cable Internet connection. It came with a CD of drivers for the USB connection to a computer (from 2004), a printed setup manual, and the hardware with cables. I registered online and found new drivers (from 2007) so I downloaded them. However, I have not been able to uninstall the previous drivers, even after taking advanced steps to delete the keys from the registry that linksys failed to remove after uninstalling. Therefore, I cannot install the new drivers. Also, there is NO WAY TO CONFIGURE THIS MODEM. It does not have a web interface or any software that allows you to configure anything. The only way to use this modem is to plug it in and hope that everything works by default. You can do a hard reset by holding the power button for a long time, but you will never be able to change any of the settings.I think un-configurable hardware is a waste of money."
2,Setup difficult,The modem works well but was very hard to set up. Much harder than an Apple Airport that I had setup previously
2,Slow modem Poor quality product,"I bought this because of looks and price. However, it took me nearly 8 hours to get it to work with ATT and XP. Uggg.... And I noticed that connection speed was slower than the leased RCA modem. This modem was made of... plastics and didn't even look that good in person. It didn't have on/off button, which I use sometimes. Light indicators were not very informative and somewhat confusing. Poor quality product...."
4,Can't Wait,"I cant wait till my modem arrives. I had DSL here in Northern VA for a while, but the speeds were not going to well. I switched to Cox Internet service. I must say at the begining i thought it was much worse than the DSL. Glad to say latley i have been getting consitant 1mbs speeds and sometimes a little under two. I have all Linksys equipment, Cable Router, Switch, Hub, Wireless Lan, KVM. No problems in 5 years of equipment use.The Toshiba-yuk modem that i have now just has no features. I think that the Linksys modem actually will connect to cable router at 100mbs, and if it does, I would like to see if I get any true performance diffrence.Anyway, I can say $10 a month on a company I have had good experience with."
1,Bad Modem with AT&T,"I love most Linksys products but after reapeated phone calls and trying everything imaginable, we couldn't get this modem to work with AT&T in the Seattle area. Swithed to an RCA DCM 245 and everything worked likea charm"
1,Comcast refuses to support this cable modem,"It is actually not fair to rate 1 star for this cable modem since I never had any chance to use it. I bought this cable modem on 1/15/02. Then, my ISP, Comcast, told me that they could not support this cable modem simply because BEFCMU10 is too new on the market. Linksys claims that Comcast has already certified BEFCMU10. However, Comcast continues to tell me to throw away this modem and use their certified cable modem. If your ISP is Comcast, call them at least 3 times before you buy this modem since different Comcast sales representative can tell you totally different story about the cable modem they support."
4,does what it is supposed to do,"My cable company was getting me for $5 a month, and I was paying it for a full year, then they lowered it to $3 a month and I wasn't so upset anymore. When I see a deal like this, I have to go for it. When a rebate is offered, this will pay for itself in no time at all. I opened it up, and without reading the directions, hooked it up just like the one the cable company gave me. Gave the cable company a call, and gave them the MAC address and now I'm saving $3 a month. Works just like the Scientific Atlanta box that I had. It sits on top of my SMC router and fits nicely."
5,Excellent Product,I have had this modem connected for three weeks now and it seems to be faster than the modem I was using from Cox Cable. It also works great with the WAP54G that I got.
4,A Superb AT&T Approved Modem Replacement,"The replacement of this modem using AT&T(Tech Vincent)onlinetech chat was done efficently, fast and mentally painless. Duringchat I was provided a link to AT&T registration site and thefinal phase using the AT&T desktop icon was a quick check listwalk through. The first stop on the cyber-speed way was Test MySpeed.com(496kbs). The second stop was PC Pitstop.com for download tests. A 500kb file at 1869kbs and 5000kb at 1344kbs,download time was rated in ms. This is a attractive applianceand the color scheme looks good next to my Iomega Zip. For thecapabilities and half the cost of other approved AT&T modemsthis is really a good buy."
5,Awesome and easy!,"I had previously bought the Best Data Cable modem from Amazon, and needless to say after spending a whole week with AT&T, it just did not want to work (thanks Amazon for the quick refund!). I later purchased Linksys, and got it hooked up in 5 minutes!...I swear that the speed was a lot faster than the Toshiba that I was renting from AT&T. Only complaint I had is that it does not have an on/off switch, but not a big deal...."
2,Always having to reset the modem,This modem works marginally..I have had to reset the modem at least twice a month since I purchased it..After nine months it died...
3,BE SURE MODEM WORKS WITH YOUR ISP!,Check with your ISP (Mine's comcast) before purchasing! Their website should have a list of compatible modems! This one is not compatible with Cocast Colorado! I found out the hard way~
3,Linksys BEFCMU10 EtherFast Cable Modem,"I had heard alot about this product, but frankly this modem is not impressive. It is actually really slow and frustrating to use."
1,"High hopes, wouldn't work.","Plugged it in, called the cable company, couldn't get it to identify the incoming cable signal. Called Comcast, called Linksys. Both very helpful, both agreed it was a bad modem. Returned it (easy as always) got a new one, same exact sequence of events. Amazon rerfused to send me another on to try a third time. Can't give it a higher rating even though all othe linksys products have worked perfectly for me."
1,WARNING -- Major issues with BEFCMU 10 and Windows XP,"After purchasing this modem I started to have an annoying problem where my PC would spotaneously restart in the middle of working on the internet. I contacted Linksys technical support, and they refused to admit that the problem traced to their product. After spending many hours with the Microsoft technical support help desk, we definitively isolated that problem to BEFCMU10.sys -- the software that came with this modem.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MODEM IF YOU PLAN TO RUN WINDOWS XP OR UPGRADE TO IT AT A LATER DATE."
1,"Mac Users, Stay Away from This Product","I bought this product (version 4) and tried to use it with LinkSys BEFSR41 version 4.1 router connected to an iMAC and MacBook Pro via Airport Express (wireless). No luck. Actually the router worked seamlessly with Airport Express and a Comcast cable modem. After trouble shooting, it appeared that the two Linksys products were not compatible with each other. Furthermore, BEFCMU10 does not want to work with AirPort Express. I called LinkSys; they would not help unless I paid $32 because I bought their modem and router at eBay although they were brand new. By the way, my computers are running under OS X 10.4 and 10.5, respectively.I am going to keep the Comcast modem and LinkSys router because they worked together well and allowed me to connect to iMAc and MackBook (via Airport Express) at the same time and toss the LinkSys modem."
4,Solid Value,"I bought my Linksys Etherfast almost two years ago now. It has been solid and easy to use. I had it set up in less than five minutes and easily recovered from my ISP changes when AT&T left @Home to use their own attbi.com network. It has run without difficulty since I installed it. It certainly could use more flexibility in the firewall configuration but it does do the job. Previous firmware updates wiped out configuration on the switch, but the latest ones seem to hold the configurations just fine. If you want the extra security and ease of use this a the right switch for the price."
1,Don't buy if you have Charter,Does not work with Charter Cable...I don't know if it actually doesn't work but charter refuses to add this modem and so it's a waste.
4,Linksys BEFCMU10 Ethernet Cable Modem,"Linksys products is one of the networking products that I can rely on! This modem replaces my 6 year-old modem to speed up our home internet connection. We no longer experience download and upload congestions. It is a true ""plug & play"" equipment!"
4,Documentation,Had problems getting product to work properly at first. Had to make several calls to Technical Support to clear this. Good documentation could have avoided this.
4,Another great product from Linksys,"I am becoming a big fan of Linksys products. I had my cable modem installed 2 weeks ago and have not had any problems with the modem. All the technician did when he installed the modem was to plug it in and call the MAC address in. It could not have been easierThere are reports of issues with Windows XP and this modem. I would be willing to bet that the people that are experencing the issues are using the USB interface, since I have not had any issues while using the LAN interface. Actually I have the modem connected to my Linksys Wireless router / switch.The bottom line. If you plan on using the USB interface and Windows XP, I would check the Linksys website to see if they have new drivers to correct the issues. Otherwise, I would recomend this modem to anyone."
2,Slow and unstable,The BEFCMU10 (Version 3.0) cable modem is not Linksys' best product. It is unstable (requires a reset about twice a week) and has long latency under high traffic. I was running a Voice Over IP connection over this cable modem. I had poor performance and poor reliability.Replaced this with a Motorola Surfboard SB5120. The SB5120 performs much better with much lower latency. Greatly improves the quality of my VOIP service and never requires a reset.Wait for a new release (version 4.0?) or buy a SB5120.
1,BUYER BEWARE - AMAZON SELLING OLD VERSION 2,"I recently purchased this item from Amazon. What I received was version 2 of this modem. The current version on the Linksys site is version 4. As a Cox customer, the results of my purchase were unsatisfactory. I will be returning this and purchasing the version 4 Linksys from another vendor."
4,Make sure you get the latest version - 3,"I had purchased this cable modem from Amazon around September 2003. Had the same ""lock-up"" problem as described in some posts. Linksys tech support was not much of a use. However, since it was still under one year warranty, I exchanged it for version 3 (original was version 2). It had cost me additional $15, but version 3 works fine."
2,acceptable performance,"It looks better than the ugly RCA modem but it may not perform better. Like others who don't want to pay the monthly fee for the modem, I bought this to replace the RCA modem provided by Comcast. After I installed the Linksys, the connection drops frequently. I call Comcast and they sent a technician to check. The technician ran a test to check the signal strenght. It was 3. The normal range should between 0 and 16 so 3 is in the low range and he said that may be why the connection drops. The incoming coaxial cable splits two ways, one goes to the TV and the other goes to the modem. That weekens the signal further. He suggested not to split the cable and make it go to the modem directly. After that, the modem works fine. So, the major problem is not entirely on Linksys. However, if the RCA modem can maintain the connection using the same weak signal, why can't Linksys do it?"
3,strike one...,"First modem was dead out of the box. On it's way back to Amazon now with a replacement on the way to me. Couldn't get it to synch with Cox Cable in Northern VA. I worked with Cox support...tried cycling power, re-provisioning, unplugging for hours...nothing. When the installer guy hooked up his (Toshiba) modem, it synched immediately. After two days of trying to synch my Linksys, I decided it was dead.Also...Wish Linksys would re-label the lights. Seems a bit confusing the way it is (see earlier reviews). My ""cable"" light never stayed lit (like you would assume it should)...but regardless...I couldn't get an IP address from their DHCP server. I have confidance in Linksys products, so I still give this modem 3/5 stars. I'm sure the next one will work fine (*crossing fingers*)."
5,Linksys BEFCMU10 Ethernet Cable Modem,"Buy this item with Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router. The crime is unreliable connections and slow downloads. The Batman and Robin of the IT world is the BEFCMU10 paired with the WRT54G. POW, SOCK, BAM"
4,Try again with Version 3,"Bought a Linksys BEFCMU10 (version 2) in January of 2003. Initially had a few problems requiring that I reset the modem. Problem turned out to be an ISP problem. Problem fixed and had a year and a half of excellent service.Yesterday, my Linksys BEFCMU10 failed. I bought a new (version 3) and am back in business.At $10 per month to rent a modem from my ISP, I am still money ahead buying my modem. However, the Linksys modem does get hot and the heat is probably exacerbated using the modem with a stakable Linksys router as I do."
1,Unhappy Amazon Shopper,"I was extremely disappointed with Amazon for listing this product and selling it to me without advising me that there was at least two more recent versions of the product. Amazon shipped me version 2 of this modem which is not even supported anymore. It was my cable company who alerted me to the fact that I was screwed by Amazon, and that there is a version 3 and a version 4 available. No where in the information provided by Amazon did they reveal the fact that there were other versions of this product. I'll have to think hard and long before purchasing anything from Amazon again."
5,But I won't order it from Amazon,"After speaking to both Amazon and Linksys customer service, no one can tell me what version I will get. Amazon doesn't have the version information and Linksys says that the distribution channel used to ship for Amazon contains mixed inventory so there is no way to know or predict what version will be shipped. Too bad to lose all the other great things about Amazon over sloppy supply chain management."
2,Caveat: Doesn't work with Charter Pipeline Service!,"I got the beautiful modem and was very excited. Turned out that it doesn't work with the Charters pipeline service. I wish someone had posted a caveat earlier before I purchased the modem. It's too bad, as it would have been a good value. The status lights are too recessed relative to the oval shaped cover, so the lights don't go with the labels on the cover when viewed from any angle other than straight on. That's only a minor gripe, of course, since none of us are going to stare at the flashing lights all day, provided that it works properly. If you are on Charters and found success with this modem, let us know!"
2,Linksys V2 Cable Modem... Slow (9/10th speed drop),"I bought this modem at best buy and got it for 60 after rebates. I went from the genernic modem that charter was using and pulling 300k downloads (2MB service) to linksys pulling 40k downloads. The speed test went from 1929kB to 350 kB. Unacceptable. It was easy to set up with all my linksys gear that is why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star.The internet is so slow I could almost compare it to dialup in some ways, pull one download and surf speeds are cut to a tenth of the speed. We had MSN DSL before this and it was 500k and pulled 75k downloads so we went to charter cable for 300k downloads (and higher at times 600k +) . With this modem we are 1/10 of that.Called linksys and they were of little help. I am RMAing this unit for a V3 and we will see how that works. For now all I can give it is a 2. Linksys really dropped the ball on this one."
4,Great if you don't need to contact customer service.,"This product is great, but if you need to get help from customer service plan on waiting 30 to 60 minutes. After the elevator music stopped, the service was good courteous and helpful."
2,Modem was either defective or wouldn't work with Cox,I was really excited to get this modem at a good price.Got it in the mail yesterday and called my ISP (Cox in Virginia to set up.)Gave the tech the MAC address and we could never get it to work.Not sure ifA. the modem is defectiveB. this version of the modem won't work with COXC. I had a bad tech on the phone with me.I just had the tech put in the rental's MAC (a Toshiba PCX1100) and everything was back up.Guess I'm gonna ship this bad boy back and buy something else.....
2,Reliability Problems,"Setup easy, performance fine, but died in a few months. Same problem with BEFSR41 Router. This seems more than just coincidence; previously used Linksys and they were good products. Now they are substandard from reliability standpoint. Am replacing all network products with Netgear; will not buy any further Linksys products."
5,It works well with comcast cable,"Just follow the manual step by step. The mac address can not be added automatically, you need to call comcast to add it in."
4,Easy even for me!,"I'm running an OS10X Dual Core iMAC at home. Just plugged the modem in and it worked, nothing to change. Works great. Great deal."
5,Linksys Cable Modem,"I had a Motorola Surf board, for several years without issue,and then things started going bad. I guessed the problem was with the modem, since everything else was OK. I replaced the modem, and had it up and running in 1/2 an hour. You must call your cable company to tell them of the new units. Everything worked within 5 minutes of reaching the Cox helpline. system speed seems to have tripled, or more. So far so good, time will tell how long it lasts. the failure mode was gradual de-grading of service and really long down-loads, caused by errors. Six months, later everythign si still fine."
1,Mein Kampf for children,"Another rosy sermon from the man in the balaclava for people who think there aren't enough David Koresh wannabes around and want to encourage this one in particular. Still, if you really think your kids should admire men with guns because democracies are but a waste of time, by all means, get it!"
2,Overpriced,"I ordered this item as a gift because a local store didn't have any when I went to purchase one. However, that same store had one this weekend and it was half the price. . . wish I would have opted for a gift card to that store rather than ordering this one. One bad purchase decision in several years and many purchases from Amazon isn't too bad I guess. My advice: if you're interested in this product, visit any location of the outdoor products store based out of Springfield Missouri!"
2,"Works, sorta","This item does work OK but often needs resetting. It will cause the phones in the entire house to not work at all. Resetting solves the problem.BUYER BEWARE...the ""compatable"" remote sold separately is probably not compatable. The ultra fine print on the box and in the instructions (after opening the package) identify the remote as incompatible with the RC930. Amazon sells the separate remote with the impression they work together. They do not...Amazon should be ashamed!"
1,Bad idea if you want to use it for the phone extension,The static noise level generated from the jack is so high that it is practically not useful for a phone jack extension.
1,"Terrible, Do not buy.","Works terrible especially if the wiring in your house happens to be segmented. Tried to use it on an inner wall, but our phone line is on an outer wall so it would not work. Does not work as advertised."
1,Worthless,Used this for all of about 5 minutes. Couldn't connect at all. Gave one star only because I couldn't give 0.
3,Not bad for browsing the web,"I have a limited number of phone jacks in my home, and the RC930 helps out alot. Without it, I would have phone line strung everywhere. I use the RC930 for internet access for my computer upstairs. I usually connect between 33.2 and 34.6 Kbps with the units about 15 feet apart. I have had fluctuations in the speed from 19.2-37.4 Kbps depending on what I have operating at the time. It's a little slow, but not bad for surfing the web or playing some online games. I wouldn't recommend it if you download large files, and I keep a long phone cord for those purposes. If you don't mind phone cord all over the place, then I'd recommend just purchasing the extra phone cord; however, if you'd like an alternative, then the RC930 works fine. The price is way too high for what it's worth, though. This is why I only give it 3 stars."
2,Did not work well,"I tried this to use a fax two floors above my Vonage phone modem with fax outlet and performance was very spotty. Sometimes it worked, but many times I'd get a ""poor line condition"" error message when I tried to fax.I finally broke down and ran telephone wire to that room through the walls. It was a pain, but I finally got my fax to work all the time."
1,very poor,"I bought this for my mother who thew away the box. I would be sending this product back because it does not work! It doesn't even have a range of 6 feet! At 5 feet it has so much noise on the modem it would not work. We then payed to put in a phone line instead, that works!"
3,Slow but effective,"Don't be fooled by the review, it can ONLY connect up to a Max. of 36.6. Although it does work, albeit slow, very well."
3,Mixed results when using with Dish Network 522 DVR,"I purchased this product so that I could use the caller-id display option on the Dish Network Model 522 DVR. The caller-id display didn't work. Everything else works fine. I can connect a phone to the extension unit to send & receive calls; no problems there. The diagnostic tests with the DVR checked out OK, too, with outgoing ""calls"" from the DVR going through. However, when the DVR is connected to the extension unit and a call comes in, I can hear another phone in the house ring 1 time, then that's it; the line goes dead. The phone that is calling in gets disconnected. This phone line is also our AT&T DSL line; I correctly used the DSL adaptor in connecting the base unit to the phone jack. Maybe there's some sort of issue with this Wireless Modem Jack working on a DSL phone line."
4,Good enough for a fax machine,"I just used one of these to move my fax machine to a location that didn't have a phone jack. There's a pretty bad 60 Hz hum (powerline noise) on the line, so I wouldn't use it for a voice line, but I've both sent and received faxes with it successfully.Some of the reviews indicate that buyers clearly don't understand the technology. This product is ""wireless"" only in the sense that it allows you to avoid running a dedicated telephone wire. However, the base and extension units communicate with each other over the power wiring in your home, not via any wireless communication technology. This is why the devices are sensitive to being plugged in via surge protectors. The documentation provided with the product fails to make this clear."
2,Worked well... for a little while,I was happy with this product for a year. Funny how the warrenty is a year. Just after the warrenty was up it stopped working and customer service was useless. The suggestion I got was to buy a new one... I will buy a new one but not this brand.
2,Too Slow!!,"I purchased it on Ebay for 40 bucks and thought I was getting a good deal. My condo doesn't have a phone jack in the spare room so this was better than running a phone line from one room to the next. Unfortunately I haven't been able to connect any faster than 28.8. Yikes!! My place is only 5 years old. Price was right, quality was wrong. I'll stick with the long phone lines."
2,This product can be a useful compromise,"This product will reduce the connection/sound quality in any and all circumstances, but may also be a useful compromise. If you have decided not to add a new telephone jack, even though you could probably use one; you may want to get this. The ""wireless modem jacks"" are superior to the less expensive ""wireless phone jacks,"" they provide better sound quality and faster data rates. I know this from experience(the modulation of the telephone signal into a radio signal is the source of the quality loss). I have also read that nearby ham radios may experience some interference.All in all, I'm glad that I have one but the outrageous prices that are charged for this very simple device prevent me from giving it more than two stars...This price is bad enough."
2,"useable, but not good","I bought one of these to use with my laptop and also as a phone extension. The quality of the sound was fair (always a low hum and static, but I could still carry on a conversation.) The modem connection was slow, as noted by other reviewers. The reason I took it back was that the phone hooked to this jack would ring 20 or 30 times a day, but no one was calling. I don't know if it was picking up stray signals or what, but I just got sick of picking up ""ghost"" calls."
4,It kind-of sucks really,"Had a small setup problem (I needed to do the security setup before it would let me hear a dialtone), otherwise I use it on my tivo and it works just fine (so far).Update (several years later). This unit is really lousy. I called tivo for an unrelated issue one day, and the guy on the phone said ""you're using one of those wireless modem things aren't you"" - he could tell because my dialup pattern was an abbatoir. I didn't know because the tivo managed to mask the failures, but after trying several online tivo updates, I got to finding out how much this really doesn't work. I have a series 2 tivo now and am using an 802.11 network which is infinitely better and faster."
3,Not perfect but it works,"It was difficult to set up, and it does NOT work with the RC920 extension that Amazon is combining with it, but it does ultimately work."
1,Not useful at all,It did connect but only once through my modem. Its a revolutionary product but I would prefer to wait for a better product in the market.
3,Good Alternative to Hard Wiring,"I bought this as a required telephone connection for my satellite TV. This saved me from having to run a TV cable to my satellite box. The baud rate isn't great for other applications, but this works well for what I bought it for."
4,Good product for the cost,"I am using the product to connect a DirectTv receiver to my phoneline. Out of the box, it was fairly easy to setup and to date, appears to work flawlessly. My receiver is able to successfully, down and upload data. Please note, that the setup instuctions states to plug the transmitter in first, then the receiver, check for a connection, then set the security codes. I found that before the units will connect, I had to the set the security after plugging in both units."
2,Added Static too line,Installed item same as i did for my Replay TV unit back in the day. It added toomuch static too the line to be able to have a voice conversation.
2,Amazon bundles non-compatible items,"The RCA RC 920 that Amazon sells bundled with the RCA RC 930 are not compatible. Call Audiovox, the actual manufacturer, at 800-409-5111 to confirm. The RC 930 works fine. The RC 920 is worthless."
1,Wireless Modem Jack,"I didn't like this product. When you plug it in, I expected the green light to turn on and the system to work. Well it didn't just turn on. You had to program it and it was hard to understand. I never did get it to program."
1,No exchange or return,"I ordered this from a third party thru Amazon. It was not compatable for what I needed which was probably my fault. I was not able to exchange or return the item for a refund or partial refund. It was probably my fault for not researching my purchase more, but I will definitely not be ordering from third party merchants again that I am not familiar with."
1,RCA Wireless Modem Jack,Unfortunately this wireless modem jack had a substantial amount of line noise. I was able to connect to the internet at 1/10th the normal speed due to the insufficient connection. I will give this to another family member to try in a newer house.
1,Too Noisy,"There was too much line noise, even in short distances. I ended up just adding a new jack to the room that didn't have one (rather than using this device)."
3,This movie I liked,"I liked this movie, it had alot of action, she had to fight a samurai, ninja's, a evil sorcerer and a couple of other bad guys was pretty good movie."
1,Better then Ninja Vixens...,Better then Ninja Vixens... but that's not saying much. The best thing about this movie is the cover art. 'nuff said.
4,God Rest Ye Los Straitjackets,"This is a fine seasonal effort from America's rockin' instrumental combo. A natural comparison would be toThe Ventures' Christmas Album. In fact, the version of ""Sleigh Ride"" here is almost a note for note copy of the Ventures version. But while the Ventures album grafted intros from then recent hits onto most of their Christmas songs, Los Straitjackets only do that on a few of the songs here. ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"", for example, uses the intro to the surf classic ""Pipeline"" and later uses it's organ solo. Anyway, this is a really fun Christmas album. If you are familiar with Los Straitjackets and enjoy them, I think you will dig this."
5,Love it!,"This fun, rock 'n roll version of Christmas songs is fantabulous! All that steel guitar makes me think of Christmas in Hawaii."
2,Okay. Just not special.,"Los Straightjackets are talented guys. I really enjoy their style. I was really hoping that this holiday CD might bring me some new favorites to replace the tired old ho-hum of Christmases past. No such luck. There are a few really good tracks, but nothing to write home about. Sorry.'Tis the Season for Los Straitjackets"
3,Solid Christmas surfing,"The CD cover says 13 Rockin' Christmas Instrumentals and Los Straitjackets certainly deliver. The surfing style adds some real pizzazz to the festivities and variety to the spectrum of holiday music, but I'm not sure how often I would want to hear the CD in its entirety as contrasted to having it mixed in with other albums."
2,"Sorry, I love Los Straitjackets, but this is not up to par","While there are a few well-performed XMAS tunes here, this CD lacks ""sparks"". There is nothing that is remarkably well done, and there are a few tunes that are rather poorly arranged and delivered without passion.Some tunes imitate the style and delivery of the Ventures Christmas Album. That disk is a truly excellent collection. But the Ventures just did it better. Los Straitjackets are a great group. I own all their CDs, but this CD is less than what they are capable of."
2,BORING! This is the WORST LS record.,"I have to say as a LS fan that I was hugely disappointed with this record. Pete Curry is a great bass player, song writer, guitarist, etc. and he is fantastic when he's producing/engineering another band (Torquays ""Somewhere in California"" - true 5 star surf/rock instrumental record) but this is a terribly boring record. It sounds like ""Ka-Ching"" to me - let's see if we can make the cash registers ring with very little effort. This is especially the case when you listen to the fantastic new release produced by the great Mark Neill - ""Supersonic Guitars in 3-D"" rocks! Tis the season to give this one a pass and buy the Ventures Christmas record instead."
4,"Fine Dining, but Difficult.","This book is really nice and it lets you dine divinely, but the level of difficulty is pretty high. A lot of the entrees aren't something that you would fix your family on a regular Tuesday night, but they are nice menus for a dinner party or a romantic evening! Afterall, there is a reason that she is the ""Duchess""!"
5,You Don't Need 3 Million Sq Inches Of Cooking Space,"The last 3 grills I have purchased were way too big. No need for that expense and space wasted for a family of two. The grill is new to me but I have mastered the basics (Dogs, Burgers, Brats)with ease. My next project is to do indirect and go low and slow for some BBQ Boston Butts.I like the ease if clean up, the grate has flaps on the side to adding hard woods (for smoke) or more coals (for heat) is super simple. The Dome has a hook that allows you to hang it on the side of the bowl. It's a great grill for a party of 8 or less."
5,Quality,"We're enjoying our new Weber grill. Quality is superb, this grill will last a long time. The size is terrific for us - we don't feed the hordes. It's on our deck, and the ash catcher at the bottom works perfectly. We actually have a gas grill, but don't use it now because grilling over charcoal tastes so much better, and this Weber makes it ultra-convenient."
5,My husband loves his new grill!,"I purchased this grill for my husband's birthday, and he loves it.It cooks much faster than the smaller Weber grill we have. My husband prefers cooking with charcoal--and will not own a gas grill. We have been Weber grill users for 44 years! Nothing better than a Weber!"
1,Buy it elsewhere,"Amazon.com usually ships this within 24 hours? It's been over a week, the item is still supposedly in stock, and it still hasn't shipped. It's a great product, but buy it elsewhere."
4,Get the larger one,"I bought this a year ago and it's been everything that you'd hope. It's really like magic, nothing burns and everything comes out fantastic. Not sure why, I think it has something to do with the quantity of heat that charcoal puts out, but I definitely don't know anything beyond ""cooks like whoa"".The legs on these grills suck, like many other reviewers have commented.I do have one piece of advice... buy the ""normal"" 22.5"" weber, not this smaller one. Nearly every accessory is made for the 22.5, very very few of them fit this one."
4,The heat is on!,"It's everything I wanted in a charcoal BBQ, although next time I'd probably splurge for the 22-inch model."
3,The Quest,"This was the Pilot for a new series, that for some reason, didn't last very long. I thought it was a good premise but I guess the westerns were beginning to die out. I was the Location Manager for this Pilot. Although it was supposed to be in the great Northwest, we shot it in San Rafael Valley, about 15 miles South of Patagonia, Arizona. We were only about one mile from the Mexican border. I think you will enjoy this show because it tells it like it really was in the old west."
4,The Quest is a favorite of mine.,The Quest is a story that I have been searching for. I would love to get the box set. I remember the late nights staying up just to catch the next adventure. I hope the box set is offered.
2,hmmm.....,"I'll admit that I was in a bit of a hurry, but I'm not a terribly ham-fisted mechanic. The first time I inflated these tubes, when removing the pump from the valve stem, the entire stem pulled off of the tube. Obviously instant, unrepairable flat and a useless tube. My feeling is that the valve stem separated from the tube far too easily. Maybe I just got a bum tube, who knows."
1,Tire tube,When the tire tube arrived (1) would not inflat so I purchased another from a nearby store to save time.
5,No problems or surprises !,"Installed apair without a hitch. No bulges or weak spots apparent. Aired 'em tight in the tires to seat, deflated and re aired them once installed. They have been in use for about a month with temperature extremes (HOT) lately. Have not had to refill or aid air since install. Not glamorous product, but hey they work like they oughta' !"
1,Not good......,"I did read some review before I ordered the tubes; it was my mistake for not listened to the bad raters. I don't know how the others gave such high rating on this tube; is BAD!! I bought two, one of the tube is not even (after pump air, a section has a egg shape). I thought I could live with that, however, one tube leaks air after the first used, the other leaks after the 3rd used!! The high rated user might got lucky for their tubes, but I think this is due to bad quality control. Good luck if you still want to get this!!"
1,Terrible Tube,"This tube did not even last 10 mins. Inflated to proper pressure and it blew out 5 mins later, before I could even get ready to ride. Do not waste your money or your time."
1,Four Flats - Three Days,"I just started using these tubes, although they were sized 26 X 1.9-2.35. I have rarely had problems with flats, and I ride ALL THE TIME! I rode three days straight and got four flat tires. The terrain I was riding was rocky, but not so much as to warrant flats at such an alarming rate.Additionally, the air valve is a very loose fit, but I was able to get air in the tires. I thought my pump was jacked up at first, took apart the pump, and re-inflated with same results. These tubes suck. Don't buy them."
5,Much More than a Biography,"In this book, Rose Bird Waterman sheds light not just on her father's life, but the life and times of southeastern Maine, from the late nineteenth to early twentieth century. The incredible richness of historical detail makes the reader feel transported in time. Maynard Bird's desire to carry on the family name and make something of himself through his innate gifts and self-motivation is indeed admirable. Rose has sprinkled the story with a charming use of language and touches of wit, that make it a very enjoyable, informative and inspiring read. I hope the people of southeastern Maine are aware of this fine addition to their recorded history."
3,"Quirky, but not Great","This is ok, but not as great as I'd hoped. I love quirky British humor and I think Robert Pattinson is smokin' hot, so I thought this would be a winning combo! Unfortunately, the movie is very average and it's more plodding than quirky and funny. Robert Pattinson does well in this role, but that doesn't save the movie. It's not bad, just nothing special."
5,So True,I was not expecting to be so entertained. I must admit I'm completely taken by this young man and was glad to see he can act. Although this was not a very good representation of his vocals it was fun to watch. I am a grandmother of six and have two grandsons about the age of the young man represented in this film and although this was a bit over the top I have watched them try to decide who to be and how to be. I'm hoping to see much more from Robert Pattinson and I hope that will include some music. I strongly recommend this movie although I think it is not for the very young as I don't think they would see the humor.
3,How To Be,"How to Be is a quirky movie for Rob Pattinson fans. It is an unusual story but Rob and the other characters pull it off. It is totally believeable acting and Rob is just so precious in his neediness. I will admit that if you aren't a fan of Rob you probably won't care for the movie. However, if you are a fan of Rob you will treasure it and is a must have for your collection."
2,Not a fan of British humor,"I guess I am not a fan of British humor. I watched this movie in full but contemplated turning it off multiple times. Honestly, I watched it to see other films from Robert Pattinson. I am a Twilight fan. I found a lot of the quirkiness of ""Art"" to mimic things that the ""Edward Cullen"" character portrays. I found this unsettling. I did not want to see the Cullen character in Art. I came away from this movie deciding that I was not seeing ""Art"" and ""Edward"" but possibly I was seeing the quirkiness of Rob. Anyone that is a Pattinson fan will probably love this film. He is in all the scenes and does a great job in his character. I just didn't find this film funny and did not enjoy it. I much preferred ""Little Ashes"". If you are old enough to see that one it's a better portrait of Pattinson's abilities to take on a character besides a nerd like Art, Edward and Rob himself."
2,Are you kidding?,Dear Rob-we really love you-and are glad to know you think yourcharacter is funny---its a pity you couldn't tell the viewers thatat the beginning of the movie.
2,Not so great! But i aint mad at ya!,As much of a R-Pattz fan as I am i had to make a decision on this film or the new ROBSESSED feature length documentary that is being released on 11/10. Unfortunately I have seen How To Be. I cant hate on anything Robert Pattinson but I have to say that its not that great! I have pre-ordered the ROBSESSED DVD. I cant wait to get it!!!
5,how to be,"This movie is not for ever one but if you like off the wall comedy this one for you. Its just a verysilly movie but I love it and So buy it, even if you don't get the comedy you still have ROB to look at"
5,Surprisingly good...,"I had no expectations for this movie and I was really surprise. If you are a fan of British humor, you will love this! It's witty, great story, and just fun to watch Art as he tries to find himself. Really, really good."
1,Dont waste your money on movie HOW TO BE,This is a horrible film. I do not recommend wasting your money on this movie. It is just plan stupid.
1,Unable to play disc,"This DVD cannot be played in Australia. I have purchased a DVD from Amazon some time ago which was playable here. Can I return it with Welcome to The Rileys, and can they be replaced with DVDs suitable for Australia?"
2,How To Be,"Maybe it's me, but I barely made it through watching the movie. I like Robert Pattinson so that was the only reason I suffered through it. I enjoyed watching the additional features about ""the making of the movie"" more than the movie!"
5,HOW TO BE,I LOVED THIS MOVIE! Funny British comedy and Robert Pattinson was so entertaining to watch!!
5,Hilarious,"This movie is hilarious. Super dry humor. Robert Pattinson plays pathetic to comedic perfection. This may not be for everyone. But if you have a dark depressed side that you indulged in during your 20s and somehow are now on the other side of, you may just find this film really really funny. If you take yourself too seriously, or insist on being artificially happy all the time... well, go watch a Disney film or something."
2,Tea and sympathy please,"Although Robert Pattinson is young and virtually untrained as a thespian, he gives a heartfelt performance of a young man trying in vain to interest his disinterested parents, friends and girlfriend to take him seriously. He has no direction in life and desparately wants a close family life and to be an entertainer although he has no real talent (that hasn't stopped many young stars today)and strives to improve himself through a self help book and tutor.For what it's worth, I think Pattinson is very watchable whether playing a vampire, an anguished artist or a misunderstood young man."
4,A Beautiful Song,"Lost Witness is quickly becoming one of my favorite trance groups. Did I Dream (Song to the Siren) is a beautiful song. Out of the mixes available on this single, I like DJ Tiesto's mix the best. It is very energetic while enhancing the melody and vocals. If you like uplifting vocal trance, then this song is a must for your collection."
4,A great collection!,"Featuring the greatest hits of Tom Cochrane & Red Rider, this anthology does the job very well. Filled with all the biggest and best known songs, it suits well as a beginners guide to Red Rider. White Hot, Lunatic Fringe, Human Race, Boy inside the Man, The Untouchable one...they are all here. And for us long time fans, we dont mind hearing the classics over again. I wish they included the sweet ""Napoleon Sheds his skin"", ""Love under Fire"" and ""Make myself complete"", but that is just a minor detail. For all those curious on Red Rider`s biggest hits, check out this collection, for it is the perfect introduction to Tom Cochrane & Red Rider."
3,Better than Brian Adams!!,"On the heels of late '70's bands such as April Wine, Triumph, and Rainbow - better bands all - came this one-hit wonder that proved to be a refuge from the weirdness of hair bands and ""'80's music"" generally. None of these tracks is bad, all decent 3-star material, outside of classic ""Lunatic Fringe""After you've acquired all the obvious greats and goods, it's albums like this that prove to be a welcome find. Head East, anyone?"
2,Not so Special,"First of all the examples are not put on a CD, nor can you download them from the publishers website. That makes it a little frustrating. Secondly, it is not very indepth. So if you just want basic explanations on VBA ""stuff"" then go for it, else find another book. I suppose my first tip off to not buy the book was that the author works for microsoft. Another persons comment was quite appropriate - it is a rehash of the help (and just as helpful (not)). No hard feelings Mr. Webb."
4,I keep coming back to it,"I wanted to update my last review of this book. Since I last wrote, I have been doing a lot more Excel VBA coding and I find I keep coming back to this book. I also bought Walkenbach's ""Excel for Windows 95"" and Wells/Harshbarger's ""Microsoft Excel 97 Developer's Handbook"" and I use this one the most. I just wish it were updated for Excel 97 since VBA has changed. I find the VBA on line help in Excel 97 less helpful than in Excel 95 and when I turn to Webb's book, I find what I need!"
3,Code doesn't work,"I have some knowledge of VB and wanted to get a look at VBA, so a friend loaned me this book. It seems to be very complete and well organized, but so far the code examples I have tried don't work. This may be because I am using Excel 2000 and the book was written in 1996. I have been able to make the code samples work by just fiddling with the code until it runs. However, this is a frustrating experience for someone who likes to learn hands on, and would probably be a disaster for a brand-new programmer."
1,Hopelessly out of date,"This book is just not useful anymore. The code is old and the dialog boxes don't look or function the same anymore. I'm not new to programming, but a beginner would be totally lost. As it is I am going to send this one back and get a more up to date one, just in case I can't jam my way out of it. There also might be (and probably are) newer features not covered in this book.Aside from that, it looks as if it could have been a great book in its time. When are you guys going to publish an up to date one?"
3,How to Talk So Teens Will Listen and Listen So Teens Will Talk,"The book offered lots of examples that involves changing the way you word things when speaking to your teen with the goal that it will have a more positive affect on conversations with your kids. It's worthwhile in the sense that it gives helpful examples of ""conversation starters"" to hopefully get the teen talking. But it's no guarantee either that you will get the response you're looking for because the person you're trying to talk to or reason with has their own, seperate agenda. So it's a good starting point rather than a ""quick fix"" which, when looking at the big picture, should work out a lot better."
1,DARE rhetoric wrapped in psychobabble,"In terms of ludicrous inanity, Faber and Mazlish fall somewhere between a commercial for the Mormon Church and the novel, Go Ask Alice. Their second ride on the How to Talk so Kids Will Listen cash cow is DARE rhetoric wrapped in psychobabble, in which the parents are far more concerned with coaxing obedience from the teens than developing their minds or even getting to know their personalities. Sit-com-like, they solve everything from broken curfews to promiscuous sex by ""giving in fantasy"" and ""saying it in a funny way."" When all else fails, they resort to propaganda, telling the kids that condoms are ineffective protection against STD's and that marijuana is more cancer-causing than tobacco. Don't laugh - millions of parents and professionals take these books entirely seriously!"
1,How to Talk So Teens Will Listen and Listen So Teens Will Talk,"I do have a complain, I need to open a case for the same product I have purchased << How to Talk So Teens Will Listen and Listen So Teens Will Talk >> that I did not received untill now, for your information I will leave Qatar definitively, i.e. I will leave Qatar without getting my order on time or even not knowing if it has been sent yes or no?Can you please verify and do the needfull to get my order delivered before I am leaving Qatar on 31st of June?Appreciate your prompt actionRegardsKhaled BENSAID"
2,Not Sure.,"This book works wonders, and that is the problem. I found out my teenager has some serious issues that I've never even heard. I can't look him in the eye anymore. This book works, but unless you truly want to listen to your kids, don't read it, its a pandora's box."
3,Book,I have not read it thoroughly to give accurate view - but so far most is common sense or what we have already been doing!
5,How to Talk to Teens Will Listen and Listen So Teens Will Talk - A Great Guide for Talking to Teenagers,"Great book for parents with teenagers! I have read it twice in one week, and recommended it to two friends."
4,Good Info...I found worth reading,"With a house full of teenagers, I found this information helpful. Some details you might have read elsewhere, but as a first time reader of ""teen help"" books,it was an easy read that provided good insight for my husband and I."
3,"Easy read, some good ideas",This book is an easy read and has some good ideas for the child that falls with one standard deviation on a bell shaped curve. It lacks addressing the special needs adolescent or the child that cannot be reasoned with.
2,Not worth your money,It is the same as how to talk so kids will listen. There is no new information in this book
4,"How to talk, so teens will listen and listen so teens will talk","If you have teenagers, chances are you identified quickly with the book title. The book delivers on its promise. Its an easy read and provides you with practical advice. The authors provide simple examples on how to take these principles into practice. Its application can be extended into all other relationships. I higly recommend this to every parent who wishes to make the best out of this phase. To those parents who believe your mission is to help and support your kids to be the best they can be and in this process learn and have fun."
3,Surfin' the Net,"""Watchusdie.com"" is a low budget entry into the recently popular voyeur films like ""Feardotcom"". This is the story of a group of women living in a webcammed filled home. Everything is fine until the women start losing their lives in various accidents. As ""hits"" on the web site grow, so do the deaths of the inhabitants. The film is more of a thriller than horror as the main interest is figuring out who is doing all the killing. An interesting sub plot shows audience reaction to what is occurring on the web site and is a slight commentary on our current fascination with reality tv and the like. The acting is what can be expected from former playmates and others hired more for their looks than talent. The primary interest is a director's commentary track which illustrates quite well the trials and tribulations of low budget, renegade filmmaking. This makes the film worthwhile and on a whole, you could do a lot worse."
5,All the hits you need to hear this summer and beyond!,"It's not often you discover a CD as good as this with such consistency and quality songwriting. The album flows from the opening riff of Stay right through to the final tracks where Jacob & others lie in wait for your audible delight. Yes, Jonasay do get the inevitable comparisons to established acts out there but it's important to remember how those acts came to be. They too started with great material like this."
1,Jonasuck,"This is the worst band you never heard, and have heard already. It seems that when a band releases an album it should contain a certain element of originality, which this severely lacks. The general sound of this album is like everything else you hear, with a little more of what you hear thrown in. Basically Jonasay is one of those bands that are a dime-a-dozen. They really don't have anything to offer that you can't find in a gewgaw. The guitar solos would be fairly good, however when one realizes that the solos are the same from song to song it seems that the guitar player really wrote a few solos and figured that was enough. The best part of this album is that you don't need to listen to it and therefore you can avoid it. Do this at all costs and save your money."
4,Not so true to size!,"I bought a pair for my daughter in a size 8.5m which is her size but if I knew I would have order it in a size 9m. I think a 9m in this style would have a nicer fit on her.So, if you want to order it get at least a half size larger.Very nice shoe, though!"
4,Good Looking and Comfortable,Aerosole shoes with flexible sole are wonderful! Great for work if you like to wear a higher heel. I get lots of compliments every time I wear these shoes!
5,Unique dating book...,"More Love Tactics is a very informative book on winning the person you desire and love. Patience, compassion, and perseverance is the key to winning that special someone. By using the techniques in this book, you will eventually get your dream mate. There will be times you may think that you will never acquire the object of your affection, but you must continue applying the techniques to be victorious! Even if you feel that you are not that attractive, you will WIN in the end! What is beautiful about this book is that its not a manipulative manual of deceit or dishonesty. Because you love or desire this person so deeply, the techniques you use are coming from your heart. This book teaches you to not give up on that special person, no matter what. You will succeed if you apply the advice given. A very special and informative book! Everyone should read this book if they doubt themselves in attaining their dream mate....."
1,bad mistake,i have tried to get ahold of this dealer 2 times and amazon has tried 2 times also to get ahold of this dealer one hour after the order i noticed that the receipt amazon sent me it said vhs abd i wanted dvd the thing that makes me angry is they just irnore your emails but i will not give up on this matter they have already charged my card so much for some marketplace dealers they are some good ones but dealers like this one just make your blood boil
2,Shuts off when listening to quiets parts in classical music or jazz,"This thing is ruined by one seemingly small problem: the transmitter shuts off when it decides the input volume is too low. I guess the designers thought this would be a useful feature. Unfortunately, it makes the thing completely unusable for music that has quiet sections -- especially classical music. Its really annoying -- you're right in the middle of a piece and all of a sudden you hear a loud ""blap!"" and it shuts off. I'm going to try to return this."
2,I could not get my speakers to stop hissing,"I've tried these speakers for 6 months and could not get a clean signal from my transmitter to the speakers. This resulted in an awful hissing noise. My experience was the same whether I was running off of batteries or off of the AC adapter. The distance between the transmitter and speakers was between 5ft (line of sight) and 10ft (through drywall).If you are expecting the quality of 900Mhz cordless phones, look elsewhere.For what it's worth, my RCA WSP150 speakers were refurbished.I have put these bulky duds to rest."
4,Find a refurbished set and save BIG $,"I researched a bit and found these speakers on a popular auction website for $39.98 shipped to my door. They were advertised as ""open-box"", but are actually refurbished by the manufacturer with all the paperwork and accessories. While setting them up, they seemed a bit tempermental with the line level RCA outputs on my system. Fortunately, I have about a half-dozen possible outputs at my disposal, and I was able to find a happy medium using a splitter on my cable box digital audio outputs. The results are excellent. The range and sound quality is better than I expected, and this product is a real bargain at the price I paid. Do your homework and be patient with the setup and they will pay off for you."
3,Simple Setup...So/So Sound,"I just received my wireless speakers, and spent about 13 seconds setting them up. They certainly pick up sound when its being broadcast from my PC. Problem is, I can't just leave them on when they're not receiving. There's a slight static, similar to a baby monitor, that can be annoying. So, I'm forced to turn them on and off manually. The sound is ok...not very loud. But, if you're just looking for an easy solution to portable speakers, I'd say go for it."
1,Don't do it.,"It is not worth the money. You spend a considerable amount of time turning dials to get the signals to match on the tranmitter and speakers. You hear humming in the background. The transmitter only works with high volume. So, if it's an movie with literally no talking, this is the speaker to use. I wish I would have done my research before I made the purchase. If this is the functionality of all wireless speakers, I guess I will have the house wired."
4,Good Enough for Casual Listening,"Just got a pair and had them set up within ten minutes without any problems. Was easy to hone in on the signal and no noise despite two cordless phones and two baby monitors in our house. The quality is tinny and thin, and they are NOT for surround sound since you can not separate the two channels, but for our rec room they were a nice solution for a room that wires could not be run. If you can run speaker wire in any way, save the money, you can get much higher quality speakers for less if you dont mind the wire."
2,"One broke, other complete fuzz","I purchased these speakers about a year ago. If you'd like to know what your likely useable time is with these speakers feel free to use this example. I'm on Amazon right now buying replacements (ANOTHER BRAND) for these that have completely failed. They worked fine at first, then got fuzzier. One quit completely tonight, no power..nothing. The other still ""works"" with lots of fuzz. I find myself re-tuning the signal a lot. Time for a replacement. If you intent to use wireless speakers spend some extra bones and get a different brand. I'm trying the Acoustic Research AW-871s now. They supposedly have better range. Don't settle for cheap unless you have to. You'll probably be replacing them in a year if your patience lasts that long! Don't say we didn't warn you!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"These speakers, in one word, suck. I made the mistake of buying them because they were so cheap. I guess I forgot the old adage ""You Get What You Pay For"", didn't I?They worked ""okay"" when I first installed them.In a week, I got bad signals and the speakers didn't work properly.Worse purchase I've ever made!!Don't make the same mistake I did, please! Spend the extra money and get quality speakers!"
1,There are good 900Mhz wireless speakers out there!,I've purchased 2 sets of Recoton W440 900 Mhz wireless speakers for myself and 1 set as a gift. They provide very good sound quality and were easy to set up. Total set up time was about 10 minutes. (Took 3 minutes to unpack out of the box and about another 7 minutes to set up)
3,Semi-pleased,"I bought 2 sets of these speakers after looking into several other brands and found these to be the best price value. I'm semi-pleased witht their performance. I bought them to replace my computer speakers because I have a laoptop and an ipod where I store ALL of my music. I like the fact that if I want music in many rooms of my house, I don't have to move the whole laptop as well as a small set of speakers. I leave my laptop hooked to the transmitter in the living room and have music in any room I want, including outside.The downside: I spend almost as much time trying to get a good signal as I do listening to my favorite songs....the signal always seems to go out when my favorites are on and I find that I have to unplug the AC adapter from the transmitter and plug it back in sometimes to get the signal to come back...."
3,Not for surround sound,"These seem like capable wireless speakers, however I wanted to use them as rear speakers for my home theater. I discourage you from doing this. They are equipped with a power saver which only actives the speakers when there is a signal. So, if there is not a signal to the rear channel, or the volume is too soft, the speakers will cut out (for example - during a quiet conversation between two people). When this happens, you'll hear a loud pop. Then, when the sound comes back on, there's about a 2 second delay, and you lose the effect.I went ahead and kept them, but not for my home theater. I hooked them up to the headphone jack and used them outside with the batteries for listening to music, cds, etc when working out back. They work fine for this (just don't leave them outside or put them anywhere near the pool!).Hope this review helps."
1,no help for dissatisfied users,"Yup they worked really well for what I wanted them for, in my kitchen. I was happy for about a month. Then one speaker myseriously died. Contacting the maker did nothing. They would not support at all. I gave up. Now I still use the one speaker, because I havent found a reliable and good sounding pair to replace them with. How is it that no body seems interested in making a speaker set that would just work nicely off of the computer wireless network? WOuldnt that be the simple and useful solution for millions of us who no longer need or even own traditional stereos?"
1,Junk,Couldnt get a good signal. One worked better than the other. I finally gave up when they both started hissing.
1,RCA WSP 150 transmitter,The transmitter light when connected to the Transmitter adapter and then plugged into the power will not stay on. It fades out and then nothing is possible. I spent a lot of time trying to get them to work (going to Radio Shack) and finally returned them The replacement was EXACTLY the same problem. There will not be a third time! Bad Bad Bad.
2,Works OK. 2.5 stars,Works ok. Not worth the price tag new. I purchased refurb for half the price of new. Sounds is not CD quality. Sound is similar to FM radio as the device broadcasts over a FM signal. I live in a condo and placed 1 speaker in each bedroom and hooked the unit up to my stereo in the living room. Now I can listen to my Comcast Music Choice and CDs thru out my home.
5,They work great.,"The documentation is terrible at best, but after working through that I'm pleased with the product. I wanted to hook these up to my stereo, but the manual only tells you to use the RCA plugs and connect to the audio out. No stereo I know of has an RCA audio out.... at least not marked that way. Once it dawned on me to use the ""tape out"" as my audio out I was playing with power tools. Other then the lack of volume control at the receiver, I'm pleased."
1,WSP150 Review,"They fade in and out with reception. I got them to use for Halloween to put right outside the door no more than 15 feet from sending unit. No go had to go back to wired. They are hard to fine tone with reception and then they are not stable and fade in and out. Terrible buy on my part. Soon to be trash, cannot see even giving them away to anyone to have problems with them too."
2,Just OK for wireless!,"Had this set of speakers for close to a year now. They really are nothing special for the price. ONE problem is when running them on battery the signal seems to drift (if you lock in a signal at all)! They do come with power cord to plug each speaker into AC. I have outside wiring so this is no trouble. TWO if you walk between the transmitter and the speeakers the music cuts out.If you plan to buy these and run them on battery alone, and mounting them in a high traffic area (I mounted mine high above head level), DON'T PURCHASE THEM!"
3,Is it just me?,"I'm shopping around for wireless speakers to use in a conference room at work so that I can pull in a few folks attending by teleconference.I'm sorry, but I just don't think there's any way I could set this up on my conference table without some of my colleagues having to work very hard to conceal a grin, or even a snicker.The problem, to put it delicately, is that the antenna is, well, er, it's um, kinda... WELL, JUST LOOK AT IT! A possible distraction."
2,Worth it - if cheap enough! Not $100!!!,"picked up two sets in liquidation for a big $20 each, and while they are pretty much as bad as decribed elsewhere, I will probably find some use in the future, such as the deck.I would be royally p'd off if I had purchased them at retail price.My own main issue with them is that they are entirely unsuitable for an iPod: Whenever the audio signal goes off - such as after a playlist ends - the emitter stops broadcasting after a brief delay.Then all hell breaks loose as the speakers emit a loud chirp-and-screech noise, on and off. A nice way to wake up in the middle of they nigh, if you like to fall alseep to some music..."
1,Just Plain Baad,"The item did not work from day one. After connecting all the wires to transmitter, speakers, and my television, nothing worked. At first one of the speakers did not come on, then I noticed that the transmitter light wasn't lite. Tried plugging it into five different outlets, It still hasn't come on.Tried contacting the seller, by phone, to no avail.Took the transmitter to a repair shop, they want to charge more than I paid for the whole set. This was a lost cause. It still doesn't work."
1,"Poor Sound, Can't be used as surround","Ok, here is the deal...these cannot be used as true surround sound speakers. They plug into the headphones jack and don't send a delayed signal. The delayed signal in dolby surround sound is what makes the Top Gun jet zoom behind you or in a 360 degrees..etc......They sounded pretty lame as well. I don't know why other's had problems setting them up...it really wasn't that hard....you just adjust the signal.I'd stay away from these unless you are desperate. Spend the extra $100 and upgrade."
3,Medium success,"I bought these to use as rear channel surround speakers after reading the positive and negative customer reviews. The biggest caveat I have is that I expected traditional speaker wire connections and found, upon opening the box, the connection is either through the headphone jack or via RCA connectors (red/white). Neither option provides the channel separation for them to be used as I intended. They are easy to install, but we have a 900MHz cordless phone and a baby monitor and there are static bursts that pop into the speakers intermittently. When dialed in, they provide decent sound for the money. We're going to hang on to them and try them out on the deck next summer."
4,Had No Problem,"I purchased these speakers prior to reading the negative review and, needless to say, was prepared for the worst. I began setting them up, and was having problems getting a good signal and thought 'Oh well, guess this was a waste of money.' But then I realized I had the wrong AC power supply hooked up to the transmitter (there are 3 power supplies - each specific to the transmitter and speakers.) Once I corrected the supply problem, the speakers worked beautifully. I use them as my surround speakers at a distance of around 30 feet from the transmitter. Few negatives - the sound is a little hot and tinny, even with the bass boost button on (but for 80 bucks, sounds great) and even though the speakers are capable of running on 4 D batteries each (not supplied), the batteries will die quickly (24 hours of use or so). But overall, I am quite pleased and find them to be a great deal."
3,Kept losing signal,"I bought these speakers for a new home theater system so I wouldn't have to string cable all over my room for the surround speakers. When playing an ""active"" movie (i.e., lots of action) they worked great. When the action died down and there was only talking or no talking, the speakers would lose their signal and got loud static. Once the movie returned to louder activities, the signal popped in again.OK for music, but not as good for home theater since sound levels do not remain constant."
1,What a bust,"It is this simple. Don't buy this product. After trying for 10 hours through my stereo, both TV's and portable CD I could not get a listenable signal. This was a very frsutrating experience. I want to try some other brands but am skeptical of the whole thing now. If anyone has had success with 900 mhz speakers let me know. The only good thing about this was Amazon's customemr service. They were, as always, excellent. I am just upset my deck will still be without tunes."
3,Pretty Good Speakers,I got these for Christmas one year and had a really difficult getting good sound out of them. I wanted to use them for my PC to play music around the house. At first I would get very soft sound and sometimes no sound at all. I shelved them for a while and then decided to try them on my PC again with a Soundblaster 16 sound card. Excellent sound. These speakers are not for the impatient person. I do have the transmitter sitting on the top floor on a high shelf so that it can get go transmission. The transmitter can not be surrounded by anything. I can get a good 100 ft out of the speakers. Then I start losing signal. There are times that I get a beeping sound of them. For some reason that does subside. I do recommend them for the price. Beware it might take some time to find the right niche for them.
4,Very Good,"This CD is great for those long drives when you dont want to have to mess with the player changing tracks and such, This is one you listen to from first song to last. I have a copy of Rayko's debut ""Purple Shoes"" in my car stacker and this one is going in right next to it."
2,Below average punk rock,"A pretty girl, that's for sure, but what's with this music? Not the worst compositions, but sonically very unpleasant. Badly produced and uninspired as far as the musicians are concerned."
5,Ultra-Realism primer for a broad audience.,"This is a profound synthesis of Christian apologetics within Platonic meta-physics, resulting in one of the first texts in the post-modern Western cannon of Ultra-Realism. While occasionally descending into universalism its certainty of its metaphysics and an external creator-God who loves human beings but hates sin offers the comforts of a revealed faith to a world hell-bent on nihilism. When read in context with the saints and doctors of the Church and worthy pagans it offers a turning and a hope as no other first apologetics text can. Takes up in Philosophy and metaphysics where C.S. Lewis's Mere Christianity leaves off."
1,ZERO STARS - TOTAL CRAP,"my husband gifted me these boots, which I tried at a local store back in October.they seemed comfortable and well made....boy, was i wrong.got the first pair mid-december and within the first week of wearing them, the plastic heel part fell off from the right boot.i returned that pair and got my second pair from amazon right away.wore the second pair 3 times and the leather was becoming unglued from the sole on BOTH SHOES.needless to say, i returned the 2nd pair for a full refund.what a shame.beautiful, comfy shoes that are poorly made and a total disaster."
1,Waist of money,"So little to read in this book. Thoughts are taken out of context, hardly even make sense. Exupery is such a great writer - just read the real book, ""Little prince"" I mean, and don't waist your ten bucks on this!!"
1,Not many quotes in this book,I love St. Exupery's writing and this book contains a few excellent quotes and some others -- but not a lot of quotes overall and very little biographical information. Many of the quotes are available online. I really wouldn't bother buying this book unless you like having a few of his quotes on your bookshelf or coffee table.
4,Quick read but would be better off with The Little Prince...,"I read this last night and, while it is good and I'm glad I have it around, The Little Prince offers up MUCH more sage advice. However, I will say that I have not read Exupery's other works so I might be speaking hastily but I value my copy of the full text of The Little Prince much more....."
5,"""It is always in the midst, in the epicenter...""","""of your troubles that you find serenity.""-from Wartime Writings 1939-1944This small, 83 page book, Guide for Grown-ups, contains selected quotes from the several books and poems that Antoine de Saint-Exupery wrote during his lifetime. The title for this review contains the only words found on page 72. I picked up this book the other day and this quote really spoke to me at this time in my life. I bought several of these with the intention of giving them out as gifts. I still have one left; the quotes are great ones to meditate on. Antoine de Saint-Exupery, writer of The Little Prince, was an aviator who served in the French Air Corps during WWII; he presumably died in 1944 during a mission flying over the Mediterranean. I haven't read any of his books, however, I do love this little one."
5,The unexamined life worth leading (and reading),"Probably Ethel Wilson's most delightful novel, THE INNOCENT TRAVELLER began as a series of short stories about Wilson's own family, with a particular interest in her silly, attention-starved, irrepressible great-aunt; Wilson's publisher insisted she turn the stories into a novel, and this charming one-of-a-kind piece was the result. Topaz is born to a wealthy Victorian family in the Five Towns, and lives an extremely protected life free from much harm or much meaning. What saves her ultimately is her own essential triviality, which allows her to live through a century on two continents with her sense of wonder always about her. The description of Topaz's first cross-continental train trip from the St. Lawrence river to Vancouver is a remarkable set piece, and displays beautifully Wilson's famous skills at evoking landscape and atmosphere. I was so happy to have discovered this little gem--it's not quite like anything else I've ever read."
1,"Streaky's soooo not a ""cool"" cat!","My 3 year old brother loves this stupid thing. ""Streaky"" (or should I say 'Geeky?') has a muffled voice that you can't understand, and WHY would you want a toy that says ""Yum-Yum. This garbage RULES!"" ???????You have a choice...Either you DON'T buy this,or you be stupid and buy this and let your child copy what that garbage-eating bumcat does"
2,not the on youare looking for,PLEASE BEWARE...this is a very poor quality black and white Heidi....AND most importantly the actor is Elsbeth Sigmund...it is directed by Comici..Amazon dont post incorrect stuff on here!!!..It is worth a look if you have seen it before and are a Heidi fanatic and want to see all the versions...The very best version is the real Singhamner version by Werner Jacobs......the best version is one that follows the book and is European and has a Heidi with long braids.....
5,Wonderful experience........,"I am very pleased with my purchase and the condition of the book is just as stated, very accurate. Thank you for going the extra mile for me in expediting my purchase. I truly appreciated it."
3,Decent tape - somewhat transparent,"Product as described, and tape is decent. I bought this mainly to have electronic friendly tape to color code wires and such. The tape though is a little transparent and not as heavy duty as other electrical tape I've used. Not sure if I'd completely trust it for true electrical work. I guess price vs. quality ratio is relative here."
4,I've used better....,"I've used several brands over the years. The adhesive of this tape is not so great. The colors are vibrant which is nice, but I'm concerned about how long it will stay. I will say that the price was reasonable and time will tell if the adhesive will hold up, but initial impressions are that it's a bit weak."
2,Doesn't Stick Well,This doesn't stick as well as other electrical tape that I've used. I probably won't buy it again.
4,my 5 yr old son loves Krypto and friends,"My son loves Krpyto and friends and he owns and loves all these figures. He also loves the show. It may be simple in nature, but it provides great occasional entertainment for a boy who loves super heros. The cartoons about the heros are way too violent, but Krypto is age appropriate. Not to worry, My son still LOVES Clifford and Dragon Tales on PBS."
2,super weiner,"the toy is kinda cool, i have a daschund, so that's primarily why i bought it. the packaging was in terrible shape and the electronic features of the toy did not work at all. i would not buy from this seller in the future."
1,The Ed Wood of TV book writers,"Martin Grams, Jr. is truly the Edward D. Wood, Jr. of TV book writers. It is obvious that Grams loves classic radio and television and that he is tireless in his efforts to write books about some of the greatest series of all time. Sadly, it is also obvious that he is one of the most incompetent writers and editors to ever produce so many texts. I feel almost guilty panning his books since he so clearly enjoys writing them. However, like Ed Wood, his enthusiasm doesn't make him any more competent or talented. Take this as a warning. Save your money, folks."
2,"Quite a tome, but somewhat wearying.","I awaited the arrival of this book with great eagerness. Alas,I was somewhat dissapointed. While it is a comprehensive guide to all th episodes and includes interviews with the makers of the show, plus Hitchcock filmography, the individual synopsis'could have been written with a little more familiarity to the plot. Furthermore, the authors reviews on each plot could have been written with more description and commentary. It certainly isn't a Twilight Zone companion by Marc Scott Zicree, that's for sure.However, that being said, it was a major undertaking and it will serve as a great resource. One more thing: the all the photos look like cheap xeroxes. A worthy purchase for all you Hitchcock Presents afficionados."
4,Mystery TV show guide,If you werea fan of the Twilight Zones series then pick up the Alfred Hitchcock guide that details each show of the Alfred Hitchcock TV show of the 50's that still looks great today. There are two volumes out on DVD which you should watch each episode and then review the episode guide for questions you may have that will be answered. Shows like this one keeps your interest and are true who dunnit chapters.Don't forget GOOD EVENING from the master himself Alfred Hitchcock!Enjoy!!
2,Watchable but not a must-see,"High production values with great scenery. But don't expect a great story--it's simple, trite, very predictable. The acting is OK. The dialogue (subtitles) is almost childish like the plot, and at times confusing. In short, it's watchable if you have nothing else to do for 2.5 hours.As for the title???!!! There was no tsunami! More like a few humans capable of manipulating water and fish! Who came up with this title? Did they watch the movie first??!!"
5,It was fun to watch,My wife and I enjoyed it. It was a kick in the pants since it was nice break from typical chop suey flicksIt was nice to get something different that was entertaining.Glad we added it to our collection.
1,Horrible,"Disjointed plot, horrible direction and directing and parts of it are just plain non-sense. There is zero explanation or back story in critical parts of the story. Actors are wooden or corny. It reminds of a 60s or 70s B-movie or soap opera. Very little redeeming about this film."
1,terrible,"Long. Boring. The martial arts are dated. The wire work is slow. Be prepared to say ""what is happening"" a lot."
4,Sterling Silver CELTIC Heart Cross KNOT Link Bracelet,"Nice bracelet, better than i expected and it looks nice on my hand (and i have big hands, so don't worry about the size)"
5,best hollow since flawless,yall gotta get this one its been awile since i heard heat like this. hollow comes with sum of his best work definetly a must buy
1,Cashews were past expiration,"I purchased these Cashews as a Christmas gift. When I went to wrap them (5 days later), I noticed they were a month beyond the freshness expiration. I took them back to the store for an exchange (a 30 mile round trip to the mall and a wasted hour of my time). The clerk went through the shelf stock and at least 90% were out of date. She finally found one that was still fresh and exchanged the cashews. I didn't hang around to see if the out of date stock went back on the shelf, but I think it's inexcusable to sell old merchandise and I'm seeing it more and more at retail shops.This company used to be more quality conscious, but after this experience, I cannot recommend them."
2,This One Just Never Got off the Ground!,"After reading Neil Ravin's Informed Consent, my first question is, where was the editor? Generic drugs are capitalized, trade names are not, medical slang is misspelled. This tale of a doctor in a research-oriented university hospital has many promising elements, but they just aren't developed well enough to make a good book. The subplot involving the investigative reporter could have been intriguing but instead is ho-hum; why tell us the contents of her well-stocked medicine cabinet without disclosing her need for the many heavy-duty psychotropics? Unlike the characters in Ravin's earlier M.D., these doctors are poorly defined and sort of blur into each other. The noncompliant, hospital-hating patient does get our sympathy, and the details of the medical detective work involved in identifying his disease are interesting, but I found the book to limp along without the spark and freshness of M.D."
4,Happy Customer,"Excellent resource - the layout of the book itself is confusing. Each Binyan could be organised to be a little bit more ""concise"" overall excellent product. Got what I paid for."
4,More Support,"I own several lexicons, but like most of the reviewers noted, Holladay is the one I always reached for until I found this really old pocket sized lexicon (the same size as Souter's Greek Lexicon.) I use the pocket lexicon now first, and Holladay's second. I don't even look at BDB anymore. Too bad someone hasn't come out with a new pocket-sized lexicon for fast lookups while flying somewhere!"
5,Helpful tool for Biblical Hebrew studies,Needed this for my Basic Hebrew course at school. It was well worth the money. It will be a well used tool!
3,Good for money,Great for the pastor. It gets the job done if you want an overview of Hebrew used in the OT. Good source overall.
2,Hebrew Lexicon - need original print copy not a photocopy type look alike,"It will pass and it is a good lexicon. The main problem is the lack of clarity in the lettering because it looks like it was photocopied a few times and then bound. I want quality printing especially since my eyesight is already not that great. In looking at our Hebrew textbook, the quality of print in this lexicon simply does not measure up."
2,Sketchy at best,"This could have been a great book; well-fleshed-out characters, good plot and locations. The book moves too quickly. Nothing is ever developed. A disappointment."
4,good for starting out,"had them for about a yard and the bottom part where your hands go so you can clench your fist started wearing down. i'm assuming it's cause of clench work being that it's one of my favorite tactics of thai boxing. it may not happen to everyone, you can def feel secure about taking your chances with twins special products.the velcro stayed on point."
1,Given wrong book,I was given the instructors edition not the student not what i paid for whats so ever so upset i just want my money back as this point
3,english skills with reading,will thank you for the book. kinda off the cover is a little bit used. hopefully you gonna send me good quality next time.
3,Not so Hot,When I ordered this book there was no mention that the book cover was torn and that it was all marked up in side. In some area's it is hard to read. But it is still usable and will get me through my class. Would not have paid what I did for it.
5,"A little to much writing, but still will do the job.","This was the second of this book I had to order, the first, from a different seller never came. I paid for faster shipping and got the book really quick. Seller shipped book same day as order and I got the book within 2 days. The book had just a little too much writing in it, but it will be suffiecient for what my daughter needs for class and the price was over 50percent of a savings for us. I would definitely order for this seller again."
5,Great soundtrack to a terrific film,"Wow, I can't believe no one has reviewed this yet... Anyway, I'd rank the Half Nelson soundtrack as one of the better soundtracks of 2006. Marie Antoinette's post-punk may be all the rage in the airwaves now, but Half Nelson puts in more work in mixing both indie rock and hip-hop in the same album. Crazy! Tracks worth listening to here include Billy Bragg's ""New England""; The Marshall Tucker Band's bluesy ""Can't You See?""; Rhymefest's ""Wanted""; and of course, Broken Social Scene (whose tunes pretty much carry the entire film)."
4,Good Mix,"Honestly, I bought this soundtrack for the Broken Social Scene tracks, but I really enjoyed some of the other pieces on here. If you're a fan of this movie or are looking for some new indie rock or hip-hip tracks, this would probably be a good buy for you."
1,Digimon Data Squad Collection One (3pc) (Ws Box),The package came ripped to shreds and the dvd's hard plastic case crushed to peices and dvds got scrated from the plastic fragment but still play......it was a birthday present for my husband just month after the wedding and he was just happy that the dvds play even tho i insisted on sending it back
5,Digimon Data Squad,I have two collection of Digimon Data Squad and i was wandering if there is going to be more of the Digimon Data Squad title on this title because i like to see Digimon Data Squad 3 collection because i like to see some more if this story.
5,Charming entertainment,"Nelson Eddy is in top form and fine voice and Rise Stevens, who has a voice like honey, is both charming and provocative. Musically, this is a treat and, unusually, it is also an entertaining film. They play a married couple who are leads in an operetta (lots of lovely music) with the husband suspicious of his wife's flirting and determined to test her by assuming another identity. She sees right through it and plays along to punish him.A real treat."
5,Great deal,"The only store I can find this at is Dillard's for $70, plus a two hour drive just to get there. This is the only perfume I use so I was excited to find it so cheap."
4,Wonderful wolf book for children,"Jim Brandenburg is one of my favorite wolf photographers & authors, and I absolutely love every book of his that I've read. I wasn't paying quite close enough attention to this book when I bought it; I didn't realize it was a children's book! Still, as disappointed as I initially was, as I flipped through it, I realized what a great vehicle this book is to educate children about wolves - he covers issues of dominant and submissive roles within the pack, the role of the omega wolf (Scruffy's place in the pack,) and the hardships of wolves' lives in the Arctic. The photos are excellent, and the text is clearly-written and in large print, very easy for new readers to work through...."
5,Incredible book!,This is the best non-fiction wolf book I have ever read. It gave me a three dimensional portrait of a member of a wolf pack. My heartbreak comes because the author didn't adopt him. What a wonderful book! I am so glad I picked this one up!
5,One of the best Boxcar Children books,"Have read the first eight Boxcar Children books and think this is one of the three best with the other two being The Yellow House Mystery and The Blue Bay Mystery. This book could stand alone although an important character is from The Mystery Ranch book and might be more fun to read after reading that book. This is also the only book of the first eight to have a dedication. The Boxcar Children books are all good reading and can't think of a good reason not to read them in order. With the Box sets 1-4 and 5-8, four books are available for the price of two and a half. I read these books in order and there are references in the books to events and characters in previous books but not enough that the books could not be read out of order or as stand alone books. Gertrude Chandler Warner wrote the Boxcar Children books over a period of many years from the 1940's to the 1970's. She must have enjoyed writing them and that spirit comes through in her books."
1,Junk Food for the Christian Soul,"From the man who brought us the nine person Trinity comes the latest in a long line of spiritual junk food.If you want to read something of substance about the Holy Spirit by an actual Christian read the ancient classic by St Basil ""On the Holy Spirit.""What's next, ""Would you like some fries with that, Holy Spirit?"""
4,A great journey through the anointing of God,"For some the name Benny Hinn may conjure up thoughts of swindlers and con-artists just waiting to take a buck. Many people who ""hate"" Benny Hinn will, if they're honest with themselves, admit that they have very little belief in any type of modern works of the Holy Spirit also. The book details the life and journey of a man that becomes mightily used of God. The book displays the awesome power of the Holy Spirit and how through the manifest presence of God lives are changed forever. If Benny Hinn is a swindler then he is a swindler mightliy used of God to bring millions of souls into the Father's kingdom."
1,Bad Theololgy at its best,Benny Hinn's approach to the topic is unbiblical unbalanced and not worth reading.
5,Good Morning Holy Spirit,"Good Morning, Holy SpiritThis is a must read book for anyone wanting a true relationship with Holy Spirit. I can not recommend this book enough; it will truly change your life."
1,Typical,"If you buy into the often emotional and occasional heretical teaching of Benny Hinn, I guess you probably already have this book. If you want an honest, Biblical view of the Person and Work of the Holy Spirit, I would recommend Donald MacLeod's ""The Spirit of Promise."" It may not be as ear tickling, but it is for those who have ears to hear."
1,No comment,"This man is a fraud and he's only after your money. You can prove this in three steps!First one : Go to Yahoo.com or Google.comSecond step : Type his name under "", (""Benny Hinn"" fraud) and click enterThird step : Read one of the hundreds articles written about what I've just said.In the other side of the coin if his b.sh. helps people for real then it doesn't really matter. I mean who wouldn't buy happiness or health for money, even if that money goes to a dishonest man.But if you're in doubt before making $100 min. donations to this pastor, be absolutely sure that Benny Hinn would be the last person God would chose to spread His messages around.Did you also know that this Benny Hinn inspired Steve Martin's movie ""Leap of Faith""? There you can see how mikes, computers and an enormous group of people work for him."
1,Another introduction to spiritism,This is the second book I read by Benny Hinn. Useful as a help for spiritist/occult experiences. What I do not understand is that many Christians think this is to be a Holy Christian book. The work of an angel of light?
1,Read the Bible for the truth,"Careful! Check this book against the Bible! In fact, try reading the *just* Bible, you'll be amazed by the results of learning directly from God.... and won't be swayed by the ideas of man about the Bible (second hand)"
4,Good book,"It is a good book. I think holy spirit will guide you to do everything right, and I don't think that he really needs money, but if he writes more general things, it might be better so that some readers won't misunderstand that he just needs money from the holy spirit."
1,Good Morning All-Mighty Dollar,"Benny Hinn is the BIGGEST hypocrite that has ever walked the face of this earth. His religion is MONEY, pure and simple. WHY can't people see this??? This book and his entire ministry is all about lining his bottomless pockets. Wake up people and see this man for what he really is! Ask him to give away his riches to the poor and see what his reponse is."
5,What God is doing in my life,"I read this book years ago and felt I had gotten what I needed out of it,but no. I just lost my baby girl in a car accident about a month ago, and from that very moment God became so much more to me, he sent his comforter to me, to help me through my lost. I have never felt so much peace, beyond my understanding, I actually felt guilty, because of the peace I felt. This book was presented again about the same time, and believe me, my life will never be the same. The Holy Spirit is my best friend, my comforter, my teacher. I can't wait to see what God has for me in this life."
3,apologetics,"I like this book except for the parts where there seems to be a premise that an apology is needed for Holy Spirit. I recommend Mel Tari's ""Like a Mighty Wind"", or ""High Level Spiritual Warfare"" by Ana Mendez."
4,Keep the Faith,I always enjoy reading about the Holy Spirit. I read this book in conjunction with Face to Face with Jesus. They work well together. Keeps me faith-filled.
3,The first Christian Book I read,"It was six year ago that I read this book! There are of course some Theological differences that I have with the author that after six years of having been a Christian and having grown since that. I respect this book though and the basics it taught me and the importance of becoming more and more intimate with The Holy Spirit is something that I will never forget.I know a lot of people hate this book, but for me I feel different, I respect the book and I will never forget it"
1,For people seeking things other than Christ...,This book lacks Christ but enumerates physical blessings that can never satisfy man's inner need over spiritual blessings of living in Christ and experiencing Him.
1,Please read,"I write this review as someone who has loved the ministry of benny Hinn, until recent. The writings in this book would appear to be true, but what I know about Benny Hinn makes me wonder if anything the pastor has said holds any truth. He has gone as far as to clame Christ will appear physically in bodily form at meetings. He has also claimed to speak to kathryn kuhlman in an out of body experience. He has also cursed his enemies openly as well. All of this info is documented, just look on the internet. If you want more info do a search of benny hinn on a search engine. Read with caution. Remember, Christians are to bless those that curse them, and pray for those that spightfully use them. Also jesus warned us that if someone claims that christ is here or there, beliieve them not. For many false prohets and false christ's shall show great signs and wonders to decieve the elect if possible. Matt. 24:23,24"
4,Valuable Testimony for Just-Born-Again Christians,"When I became a Born-Again Christian five years ago, this book was of enormous help in understanding the dramatic and supernatural happenings in my life. Hinn's vivid and detailed description of the Holy Spirit was proven accurate to me by my own experiences, and provided much spiritual comfort and guidance that I needed at the time.Since then, I did see his TV show, and I could not believe that the TV-preacher apparently suffering from attention-deficit syndrome is the same person who wrote the book. Oh well, at least I found God's grace shining through his writings in this book. Check it out for yourself and Praise God."
2,Is Benny Hinn a son of Lucifer ?,"It is sad to see so many people deceived by Benny Hinn. People who belief in Benny Hinn are trapped into "" true-believer""syndrome.They have been blinded by Benny Hinn. By all means do follow him, make him rich, accept false teaching and join Benny's father,Lucifer in hell."
4,"Good Morning, Holy Spirit",This book left me with a lot of good practices to greet the Holy Spirit when in prayer. It is worthwhile to read and easily enjoyed.
2,Good Morning Holy Spirit,"Haven't read enough of it to give a review, but the condition of the books was just ok. there were no tears or stains but both books were yellowed"
4,Getting to know the 3rd person of the Trinity,"Essentially the main point is that the Holy Spirit is a person, not merely some ethereal force. There are in fact many Bible verses to support this and I found this book of great help in my Christian walk - though I don't believe that it should fully substitute for learning the Doctrine of the Holy Spirit.I would recommend itGodbless!"
4,This Book Will Make You YEARN For A Closer Relationship,Benny Hinn absolutely had me as a captive student from the first page!This book made me yearn for a closer more intimate relationship with the precious Holy Spirit.A must read for all born again Spirit filled Christians...Buy one for someone you love! They will love you for it!
1,doesn't fit,"this coffee filter does NOT fit my gevalia coffeemaker, i have a 12 cup maker. bought this because i read in the reviews that it would fit, but i doesn't. what a waste of money. i should have bought in a store so i could return this without paying. it will cost $7.00 to return and i paid $13; so i would get $6 back. what a waste of time and money."
1,Will not work for Braun coffee maker,"I have a 4 cup Braun coffee maker, and ordered this 4 cup filter for it,since it showed up on Amazon when I searched for a Braun coffee filter. But it was too large. The seller said you have to order Braun filter for Braun coffee makers. Medelco do not work."
1,too big,"The filter is too tall to fit my coffee pot, although it is exactly like the one I am replacing except just a hair too tall. My lid stands slightly open at all times. Really takes away from appearance. Disappointing, would return except it is too much of a hassle for such an inexpensive product. It is usable just looks weird."
3,"No stars here...but Amazon wants my rating, duh...","The day after this filter arrived my freakin' coffee pot died!Arggghhhhh!It would cost more to send it back, so I'm keeping it in case I buy a 10 cup pot again, 4 cups pots still works well."
5,No more paper filters,"After consuming endless paper filters, it's great to have this re-usable one. The coffee flavor is unchanged from before and it is very convenient. I have found it works best for up to 8 cups of coffee. Any more than that and a bigger filter would be better."
5,A clean help to the environment,This coffee filter is fantastic. It doesn't leak grounds through and is reusable so you never run out of the paper ones.
5,Good overview,"As an adoptive parent and adoption volunteer, I really appreciated the tenderness and honesty portrayed in this book. The stories give a good overview of the various types of adoption and offer a peek into the thoughts and emotions that accompany the adoption process."
2,Dull and Dated,The band Midnight Syndicate have long since run out of steam. Endless sequenced synth chords make the whole thing sound very cheap and tired. It's like a playstation game soundtrack from the mid 90's. No heart or depth to any of it. A let down in every way.
4,A Little Treasure,"Space is at a premium in my tiny apartment, but there will always be room on my bookshelf for ""A Hut of One's Own."" Ann Cline's meditation on architecture, art, and culture is fragmented in places, and doesn't deliver big glossy visuals or a knockout blow to the senses. Rather, it's a quiet book that unfolds with fresh opinions, and acute observations. It's thought-provoking reading for artists, architects, and intellectuals of all stripes. I've had the book for years, and still find myself returning to it."
3,Disappointing,"If I were a student of architecture, I might find merit in this wordy disquisition about tea houses and follies and other quaint little structures. But I'm not. I'm just a schlep who is deeply curious about the EXPERIENCE of building and living in a hut. The subtitle, *On Life Lived outside the Bounds of Architecture,* led me to believe that's what the book would actually be about. Mea culpa, for having brought such intensely passionate expectations to what is a perfectly innocent but drab little book."
5,Another Excellent CD from Joe Stump,"Another Excellent CD from the Shredlord, Joe Stump. These solos are played over pre-recorded backing tracks that were handed to Joe to shape into full instrumental guitar songs. And like the sonic blacksmith he is, the end product is this great CD; Brutal, relentless and faster than Superman!"
4,Good movie,I watched this movie for one reason: Ian Somerhalder. I wanted to see his work apart from Vampire Diaries. He is an accountant who find out that his wife is having an affair with his boss who is embezzling money from the company and setting HIM up for the fall. (Ouch) Ian Somerhalder and Ruta Gedmintas have wonderful chemistry together. Lots of shoot 'em up action and a nice resolve ending makes for an enjoyable movie experience. The copy I viewed did not have subtitles so understanding the dialog in places was difficult. Worth watching.
1,Don't buy,"I really have to admit that I am a huge fan of Ian Somerhalder which brought me to buy that movie. But I deeply regret it. Not even a hardcore-fan like me is able to say something positive about that movie... It's a low-cost production, it seems they not even tried to hide that it was shoot in Germany and not the U.S.. The story was more than thin and the repetitions of scenes again and again were absolutely unnecessary, except for the reason to stretch the movie...Well... like Ian wrote a few years ago (after ""The Lost Samaritan"") on a message board: ""It's been a crazy road but I'm back in the saddle and wanting to send a huge thank you and express to you that I'm truly sorry for bad movies, bad characters and most of all a bad disappearing act!"""
3,"Fun, but flawed low budget stuff","For fans of TV Vampire Ian Somerhaulder, this low budget action-suspense film will be an enjoyable time waster. Somerhaulder spends much of the movie in perile, and the plot has just enough suspense to string you a long for 90 minutes. One major flaw: Obviously filmed in Europe, this had a few too many ""American"" agents and cops with thick European accents. If you can get past that, and some flat dialog, check this one out."
3,coming plague revisited,"I felt that this book didn't say much that wasn't in Garrett's book, but it was a bit more concise. I can't really see why Garrett would offer her support of the book given that they seem to overlap so much. Overall it was an insightful look at the role of evolution in medical practice.as a side note: Why does the cover art look like a shattered Star of David. Is this some sort of subliminal message? If anyone has any answers e-mail me at amilner@ufl.edu"
3,Average,"It was pretty good. It securely holds the phone in place. Of course, it's meant for Sprint phones. But if you have one, then I would suggest trying it out. Oh yeah, it protects the phone pretty well, too. The fibers are fairly strong."
2,Pretty but not functional,This ring is pretty but impossible to wear. It is way to bulky and your finger has to be spread away from the other fingers while it is on plus the chips constantly poke into you. One of those ideas that must have been good on paper but just do not translate. I have worn it on a chain before as a pendant and it did look nice that way for a fun casual look.
2,Item not as shown in the photo,"This looked like a great deal from what I read in the other reviews, but the putter that I received was a cheap knock-off of what is shown in the photo. The ball and line markings seemed a bit less than professional, the perimeter weighted loop was just a loop and did not connect at the sides as shown, and the bottom of the club head was not solid and smooth, but instead an unfinished, hollow cavity with jagged corners. It seemed like there would be serious friction if the head came in contact with the green during your stroke and that it would need to be cleaned out constantly. It also felt lighter than I would have expected from the reviews. I promptly returned it. For what it's worth, the head cover was included."
5,Quality putter,"Regardless of the price, this is a great feeling putter. The balance feels just right and the ball comes off the face smoothly. It is very easy to align your putts. I have owned the Odyssey two-ball putter and this one is on par with it in every way. If your thinking of trying a mallet-style putter, this is a good one to start with that won't break the bank."
4,Awesome Putter for the price!!,"First, I want to say thanks for all the spot on reviews! You don't know how tough it was to buy a putter without trying it.And I was not disappointed. I have only taken it to the practice putting green,but man... this thing is smooth & I love the weight & shaft. I'm short & the shaft is prefect for me,i think it was a 34"". For the price,you can't go wrong at all with this putter. Keep in mind,the paint and quality is not the same as a $130.00 putter,but it comes with a cover and I will take care of it so it wont chip I'm easy on my stuff. I went from an old ping putter to this,and I used my ping putter for 20 years.I have been behind in the new technology, but they want a lot of money for new putters. I'm happy!"
2,Accurate but not consistant,"I've been using a putter for years that is bent. There was nothing special about this putter but I could still make shots with it. This one I bought to replace the bent putter and couldn't get anything to sink with. I practiced with it, kept practicing but no matter what I did it seemed impossible to keep a consistent speed with it. It would go the consistently in the same direction and could adapt to that. However, the power was completely unpredictable. I'm going back to the bent putter."
3,style versus content,The book appears to be packed full of very useful technical information regarding make-up types and possible uses for such.Time and experience will tell if all the information is valid or even useful in a u.k market.Was disappointed at the lack of colour photos which made the book shoddy in appearance
1,THIS IS NOT THE DANCE VERSION!!!,"I am extremely disappointed in this single. I expected the funky dance version that's being played on the radio and got these two SLOW as molassas tracks. DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU WANT THE UPBEAT, VASTLY SUPERIOR DANCE VERSION. THIS IS NOT IT!"
1,"""Dance"" version is 100% better than the Sean Paul version...","... and that just about says it all. I had never heard the Sean Paul version until I went to buy this song, yet that is the only version I could find. Where the dance version is crisp and is filled with tension and emotion, the Sean Paul version sounds like a 45rpm record played at 33. I know why this wasn't a hit, it's because this version was foisted upon us."
4,R&B'S FINEST,"I love Blu Cantrell since her song HIT EM UP STYLE came out she's been my fave in the R&B world. Now with her second single off her second album I don't understand whats wrong with us American's. this song is even better than her first singel yet it wasn't a success here. over in the uk this spent a month at #1, Blu's vocals are smooth as ever and her beauty seems to have increased. He lyrics are great and the beat is off the chain. Sean Paul adds alittle reggea flavor plus you get the version with Lady Saw. This should be a must have to all cd single buyers and all R&B fans. Blu puts whitney to shame. The only reason this dosent have 5 stars is cause the version without sean paul dosent seem as complete with oput the boy girl interaction.1Breathe(lady Saw)(9/10)2Breathe(Sean Paul)(10/10)"
4,"Well built, very easy, minor problem.",I bought this to fit in my Porter-Cable 7518 3hp router mounted in a Jess-Em lift on a Bench Dog/Wood Haven table top.This item is very well built and fit into my PC router without a hitch. Changing bits is a breeze. The only thing you could misplace is the hex wrench.The only minor problem was that I no longer could use the smaller table inserts because of the size of this item; but I can't see where that's going to be a big issue.It's nice not having to use two wrenchs any longer to change bits.
3,Not what expected,"I expected the extender to be useable for making trays with a router, but the instructions indicate that it can only be used on a router mounted on a router table."
4,Z1R Drifter,"I bought this as my hot weather helmet. Shipping was quick. The fit is great, it is very comfortable. The vents work well and the zip out neck/ear protector is a nice feature though the ear flaps could be a little fuller to block out more wind noise. At first I thought the sun shield was unnecessary but at highway speeds it acts as a foil and helps to keep the helmet from pressing up on the forehead and I now leave it on at all times. I would recommend this to anyone."
5,"Durable, fabulous, my husband even likes them","I am a fan of Le Creuset products, specifically bake/cookware. I have several pieces of Calphalon as well that have been wearing out after only 3 years of useage and decided to go all out and replace it all with Le Creuset. I can't give their bake/cookware enough praise. It heats evenly, holds the heat and cleans like a dream. As stated, even my husband likes them. The colors are great (we've been getting green and chestnut pots/pans) and keep beautifully. The ceramic lined are dishwasher safe! I love having pots that I can start a dish on the stovetop and then bake it in the oven to finish it (shepard's pie, macaroni and cheese, etc.). Don't settle for something cheaper, you will regret it and end up having to replace it in a short time anyways. Go for the Le Creuset and you won't regret the purchase."
5,Mac Pro - Features?,"As others say, easy installation and OS identified without incident.Installation:I didn't bother to lay the Mac on her side as Apple recommends because there are so few contacts. I did miss getting the card tab in the proper position first time. You'll know, if it doesn't flush with the back of the computer and seat easily, try again.Features?Use BootCamp? Don't plug keyboard into this card. Card is not identified initially. Holding the Option key down at startup so you can boot from another disc or partition doesn't work - it boots the default Startup Disc. If you have a BootCamp partition or DiskWarrior on another HD, plug the keyboard into the Mac. Assume holding C key to boot from optical would have same problem.My LabelWriter, if left on, would not allow Sleep when connected to the computer's USB port. It would try Sleep and then wake up. Connected to this card, LW can be on and still sleep soundly."
3,NoName USB 2 Card with MacPro,"Yes, as others have noted, the packaging makes no mention that this card is Mac compatible, but it fired right up and works just fine except for the sleep issue.Running 10.6.8 the card disconnects from the external drives when the computer drive goes to sleep giving an improper disconnect alert. This solution works for me: sleep the monitor only. This saves some power but keeps the externals alive.Update: Down-grading to three star. The unit causes considerably slower booting. Considering taking it out."
5,Works in a Mac Pro,The packaging and system requirements say nothing about Mac or OS X but I've installed one in my Mac Pro with 10.6.4 Snow Leopard and it works fine. Installation was a breeze.
4,USB Card,"I have always trusted Belkin products, always realible, works for the life of the computer.The only thing that upset me with this product was that it had XP required drivers on a CDROM, no information about Vista. Even the web site didn't help.This card was touted a being really for some future improvement. I figure that means new software. But I never got the chance to install Belkin's native software."
1,Hosed my computer,"Belkin provides the card and a CD-ROM with the drivers. The instructions say to install the drivers before installing the card, so that's what I did. When I plugged a USB device into the new card, my computer froze. After searching Belkin's website for a mention of this product (and not finding it), I requested support through the website, and they provided links to updated manuals that corrected a minor error in the manuals that came with the card. After this, I discovered that all the USB 2.0 ports on my motherboard had become USB 1.1 ports, and the ports on the Belkin card still didn't work. I asked for further support from Belkin and have not received a response (it's been weeks as I write this). I will not buy another Belkin product."
3,Good,"The costume wasn't quite what I expected it to be, but for what I paid for it I can't complain."
3,"frustratingly close, but...","This is generally a very good book - it's about a kid who goes from house to house in her neighborhood. In each house, a different national origin is represented (Indian, Salvadoran, Italian, Lebanese, etc.) and so the kid talks to each of them, they each are making a bread unique to their culture, and it's all done in a respectful and gently humorous way.EXCEPT for one house. At that one house, the kid is rude to her (""What d'ya want?""), they don't speak grammatically (see above), the kid's sister shakes her finger at the protagonist and ""hollers"" at her (""leave that alone!""), and there is ""loud music playing"" that makes communication initially difficult. This one house? The African-American house.When we read this book to our African-American 4-year-old, we, frankly, wince. Why does one, and only one, culture, have negative stereotypes presented with it?"
5,too good to be big? hope not!,"A terrific album and a GREAT live band. Wish they toured beyond the East Coast, but for now I'll keep the disc on heavy rotation!"
3,B-17,"I hope that my bro likes it. The key word is hope. I doubt it will ever be touched since it came in parts, like a model of 100s (it seemed). ;(."
3,Not a Kid's Toy,"Purchased as a Christmas present, Dad and Son have spent a lot of bonding time. It is impossible for a child to put together alone as it involves cutting and glueing countless pieces. It's been four days, and they are still working on it."
5,"GO MY SCENE!!!!!!!!!!!, BY ALYSSA TURNER","HI I JUST GOT THIS TODAY AND I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WWITH HER! SHES THE FIRST MY SCENE DOLL IVE GOTTEN AND SHES SO COOL! I ADORE HER CLOTHES AND HER CUTE PURSE...........EVERYTHING ABOUT HER IS AWESOME. IM 12 AND I THINK ILL START COLLECTING THESE DOLLS BECAUSE THERE SO COOL, UNLIKE BRATZ. AND ITS SO WORTH [...] I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS DOLL TO ANYONE WHO LOVES FASHION!**********PEACE**********"
1,EWWWWWWW!!!!,"OMG this doll is GROSS!!!Look at her, her outfit is nasty and so revealing. Her top is so small it couldn't cover my hamsters babies, and they little, cause they were born a week ago from now.Same with her skirt, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too short, and ugly too. And also look at her face, if their was such thing as teh ugly police, this My Scene doll and the rest of the My Scen egroup would be there forever.And shopping, again. OMG they are soooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring.Oh, and also, Bratz are better, just trying to teach you My Scene fans something, cause MY Scene dolls are slutty ugly retards that wear ugly and revealing outfits all the time!!!Bratz are better then My Scene dolls, much prettier, know fashion, unlike My Scene dolls, and...... well, you get my point, My Scene dolls suck, and Bratz are better."
5,at long last,"Saint Etienne keeps getting better at being Saint Etienne. Finisterre has all the styles fans have come to love album after album: '60s pop, dance, international electronica, with a return to the beats, filmic references, melodies, grooves, and verbal intros of their earlier work. I heard echoes of the albums Foxbase Alpha, Continental, and, in terms of keyboards, The Misadventures of Saint Etienne. It's music for the head and heart. The cold cover art doesn't really reflect the affecting songs contained within. The album is packed with good taste, smart choices, and a creamy warm middle."
3,"Not Their Best, but Still Overall Enjoyable.","It's been over a decade since their masterful debut, and the UK trio Saint Etienne are still churning out decent albums of quirky, pretty pop. ""Finisterre"" won't make anyone trade in their copy of ""Foxbase Alpha"" or ""Good Humour,"" but it's an overall appealing CD with a few good tunes. The trio's greatest asset is definitely Sarah Cracknell, whose vocals exude a distinguished cool over these tracks. In between spoken interludes, we are treated to disco bliss in ""Shower Scene,"" 80's-like synth touches on ""Amateur,"" and the carefree pop of ""Soft Like Me,"" which has--gasp!--rapping. There's more filler than I'd care to listen to, and the removal of the spoken interludes would have made this CD a more enjoyable listen. Still, any album that has the lyric ""I believe in Donovan over Dylan"" can't be that bad, and, therefore, ""Finisterre"" earns a B- in my school of music."
5,an audiomatic opera,"It flows like a movie in front of your eyes, the kind of movie you'll like to watch again and again. It's the magic of Saint Etienne, it's Finisterre (have you ever been there? ...there are at least 3 places in Europe called Finisterre, with slightly different names depending on the country they sit in). It's Mademoiselle Sarah Cracknell, back with her godgifted modulations.The boys are playing new instruments, it all sounds more modern, and it's a new Saint Etienne classic, with a narrating voice that leads you through the Suburbia, its public mythification and private dreams. Danceable hopings.""Finisterre"" is an audiomatic opera that confirms us that sometimes there's nothing as beautiful as buying a piece of magic plastic."
3,Does not mix well,"This product has very good flavor, almost a malted chocolate flavor. It does not mix well with water, very lumpy. Make sure you use a shaker with a mixing ball to reduce lumps"
3,horrible taste and after taste,"this is the only soy protein powder i have tried so i do not know if its just ON or all soy powders that taste bad. has a bittery taste and leaves a chemical aftertaste that is just awful.mixes ok, though i dont feel real good after having this. tried mixing it but its taste is very dominant and ruins whatever you mix it with."
1,Soy Protein,"Disappointed that product has aspartame as a sweetener. Tried repeatedly on line to get exact ingredients of this before purchasing, but these were not listed. Too many potentially unhealthy side effects to aspartame. There are many other sweeteners available that do not have near the risk of using as aspartame. Won't buy this one again."
1,100%.... and then something else,"I must say, I was really looking forward to this product. I was placed on a diet by my doctor, NO WHEY, NO WHEAT, NO DIARY... now I know the label says 100%, but the fine print tells you that is has MILK PRODUCTS in it. NOW I know why my stomach felt like a ball of glue every time I made a shake. LET THE BUYER BEWARE.... it isn't just SOY PROTEIN 100%... it has other stuff in it, including dairy products. OOOOOOCH. dd"
4,Exactly what I was looking for,Needed a soy product low in fat to supplement my whey protein and it's exactly what I wanted. Tastest great and supplies enough protein to hold me over between workouts.
5,Blackthorn Winter,Enjoyed very much. Readers who are Rosemund Pilcher amd Marsha Willet fans will also like Sarah Challis'works.
2,Blackthorn Winter,Very hard to get into.... I'm almost 1/2 way and can still put it down easily.............
3,Health Zenith SL Wireless Doorbell Battery,They work alright and last a decent amount of time. Just tend to slide around alot in the doorbell holder but you do what you have to. I live in a rental place and had to install my own doorbell so I do the best I can at least they are fairly priced and last a while before having to replace.
5,Works as advertised,Can work in the back and hear the bell when someone enters a shop. Excellent reception. Just get the sender/receiver aligned and all is well!
4,A Happy Little Musical,"Bing Crosby and Jane Wyman star in this backstage musical comedy that delivers on all levels. Great songs, including the Academy Award winning song Zing, A Little Zong,"" beautifully delivered by the leads, and great sets and vintage 50's costumes too. The cast is none to shabby either...with Ethel Barrymore, and a very young Natalie Wood.This is the kind of great musical that I wish they still made, but never will again. Thank God for Tape and DVD. I highly recommend this movie."
5,great on popcorn,I started sprinkling this stuff on fresh-popped popcorn a few years ago. Now I find it hard to eat popcorn without it!
4,Britten bio almost great.,"Carpenter, through numerous quotes from colleagues, friends and written correspondence from the composer himself provides a rare and intimate view into Britten's creative mind and personality. The only tedious aspect of this in-depth biography is in Carpenter's descriptions of Britten's pieces. Carpenter tries to speculate about how much of Britten's real life went into his music. The result comes off as searching for Britten's homosexuality and lost innocense in tones. It is however an absorbing and educating read"
4,Exciting read that could be ripped from today's headlines,"A Federal Offense is a great fast pace read that is what this country needs to open it's eyes to the possiblities of terrorism on any given day at any given time. It pulls no punches with the fact that our security forces are only human and have to deal with the day to day pressure of real life combined with the day to day pressure of fighting terrorism.I look forward to the next book.Good reading, great interpretation of what goes on with the FBI on a daily bases."
4,Suspenseful and fast moving!,"Mr. Poole's first novel was thrilling, suspenseful and fast moving. The plot really grabs you and keeps your interest throughout the book. Mr. Poole's style of dialogue, however, could use a little polishing. Other than that, I found his first novel to be very enjoyable reading. I look forward to a sequel and to ""Jim Marshall's"" next adventure."
2,disappointing,"I've always been interested in the Heloise and Abelard story, and I've loved other historical murder mysteries (like Elllis Peter's ), so I had great hopes when I read the descriptions of this. There are some good points about the story, but I found the characterization poor. I finished it, but only because I didn't have any interesting books on hand. This is the first in a series and perhaps the author becomes more proficient as it goes on."
5,barbie sunflower for Sarah,"my granddaughternamd i had gone to a nickel aucttion and they had the doll up for bid. my daughter was bidding on it and this Dec.20th,She was so excited . Thank you for being there at such a special time in her life ."
2,Indian Gods and Goddesses,"Not crazy about this, but then I don't really know the Indian Gods and Goddesses."
1,Cheap and worthless. Minus 2 Star Rating.,"This product doesn't deserve the star. Amazon required that I at least give it one, but I cannot do so . . . Bought one of these about three years ago. The roller worked, sometimes, and then the housing on the motor cracked. Too costly to repair, so I gave Bissell one more chance. Never again. I emphatically agree with the other reviewer - CHEAP! The wothless plastic mount for the roller brush - a key feature in a steam cleaner Bissell! - broke 6 months after it was put into use. The steam ""cleaner"" only leaves 1"" wide streaks of clean carpet where the soap falls onto the carpet. Tough traffic areas? Hmmm, that's the purpose of these machines right? Sorry, won't do it. Don't waste your money."
1,Beyond Borders Thinking Critically about Global Issues,"I understand this book is intended for college textbook use but that does not mean that it should be boring, hard to read and understand. It is more like a bunch of stories slapped together that really don't make it fun to want to read more. I wish someone would come up with a better text book that makes it interesting to read and learn."
1,I do NOT recommend these...,"I bought these one day. When I used them, after playing the cd once, maybe twice, the cd would skip...pretty badly. My friend said that all blank media are the same, quality wise, he was horribly wrong. If I even try to use them for MP3-CDs, they don't even work the first time. Please don't waste your money.*I searched around, and after some looking, I found that Sony CD-R 700mb discs work really well, from experience, I found out that they are much more scratch-resistant, and have a MUCH longer life.I hope that this review helped you... :)"
2,Disappointing story from Jean Rhys,"Well acted with great actors but I did not like it at all. The 20s society in Paris was corrupt and unsympathetic. A depressing movie. Had I focused on Jean Rhys being the source of the story, I would hesitated to order it. She wrote A Wide Sargasso Sea about Bertha in Jane Eyre, only her heroine is called Antoinette and Rochester is the villain."
1,AVOID AT ALL COST...,"Merchant-Ivory have never been more self-conscious or grasping for, for , what...a decent script by the usually capable Ruth Prawer Jhabvala? Here, she was either out-of-town - or completely overdosed on absinthe.A more disastrous film one has not encountered in a very long while. Truly embarrassing for the astoundingly gifted Isabell Adjani - who, here, is reduced to whining, clownlishly awkward self-dubbing of her English. The late Alan Bates serves up a ridiculous performance as her paramour. Maggie Smith tries hard but comes up laughable. Anthony Higgins is the one source of interest in the entire thing - and yet has such little screen time that he is genuinely better off not being remembered as having appeared in this fiasco.The liner notes proudly claim that they spent only 1.8 milion dollars on this 'event'.I - or you - could have filmed this very small and lacklustre story for a tenth of these monies, and come up with something more real.Avoid this at all costs..."
4,"Probability, Philosophy and History","There are many popular books written on the subject of probability, risk and statistics; I've read many of them. Many such books concentrate on the meaning and practical uses of probability while others concentrate on the misuses and abuses of statistics. This book is different. It is much heavier on philosophy with many entertaining historical excursions. There is little math, but what there is clear and well presented. I found the sections on Bayesian analysis of real world problems particularly fascinating, especially its use in the courtroom. Although, in my opinion, the prose is a bit awkward in a few places, mainly in the first half of the book, this does not detract from the fact that this book is difficult to put down. This work is, I believe, a valuable addition to the popular literature on probability and statistics."
5,Excellent,This is a wonderfully written book. I already have very good understanding of this topic so the authors' musings deepened my understanding and took it further. I liked the vast excursions with history and social science applications that brought out the complexity of the subject beyond the jars full of beans and toss of dies.I am reading this book for the second time. I am very impressed both by the literary and the mathematical expositions in the book. I look forward to reading other books by them. (Are there any?)
3,"Worth Reading, But......","Imagine traveling through a wormhole, at high speed, constantly twisting and turning; you want to stop and admire a beautiful pattern, see it in depth, but you are whipped away to the next turn. There are glimpses of beautiful ideas in this book, but to pursue them you will need to read more elsewhere.This book touches on an impressive number of topics related to probability and game theory, and the authors weave in a number of interesting bits of history. Sadly, they touch on many topics very lightly and incompletely.There are the makings of at least 4 or 5 really good books here, if the topics are properly covered. Overall this is worth reading, as the research behind this book is stunning in scope even if none of the ideas are adequately explicated."
3,I was expecting more ...,"In Truth, I was expecting more of this book since it couldn't catch my attention from the very beginning and almost the entire book. I think the author way of explaining is sometimes dry, with too much words dedicated to details not very important to know, maybe to complete the 300 pages. At the end of the book, the reading improve its attractiveness, especially with the chapters dedicated to predictions and fighting since the subject of weather forecasting and war strategy, both interesting by nature, are treated in a more engaging way that help you focus on the matter. Onother good thing is the charming picture of the authors in the dust jacket."
1,Poorly explained with numerous errors,"Of all the popular science I've read this is by far the most incoherently laid out, poorly explained and has numerous errors. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone seeking either of an informative read or a popular explanation of statistics."
1,"If you like pedantic writing, go ahead and enjoy the book.","I agree with the two reviewers who said that the authors were pedantic. They seemed to want to show off their universal knowledge, and that distracted from the intended ideas of the book. Their writing went off on so many tangents that it was hard to keep track of the book's main messages."
1,"Could have been good, but badly written","I bought this book thinking it would be light and entertaining. Instead, the writing is so incredibly pedant that the authors turn a potentially fun book into a long, smart-sounding but irritating prose. I didn't have the heart to finish it, but at least I've learned how not to write a book."
5,Humor rooted in the truth,"On the one hand this book is incredibly funny. Professor Jerry Mander examines the ""Billy Jeff Clinton Trailer Park Presidency."" A presidency so pathetic you just have to laugh. The Professor's own formula of humor and satirical wit will have you howling with laughter.On the other hand, the book unveils the truth about the Clinton scandal and all its supporting players. If you didn't read any of the Starr report, this book provides some of the best excerpts. And, the Professor's humor is your Dramamine to help you through it. Read about Clinton apologists like Barney Frank and learn what it is to be a ""homophobaphobe.""It's been said: ""all good humor is rooted in the truth."" Perhaps that's what makes this book so remarkably funny."
5,Excellent Travel Kit,"I have been doing pilates for over 10 years now and finally found a product which helps me continue my routine, even when I am on the road. The detailed instructions with easy to see photos are a great tool. The best part is it comes packaged with an exercise band!"
5,Very touching. . .,"I found this book to be very touching, I know I sure didn`t think it was a waste of money, I bought a book for myself and than I ended up buying another book for my mother, how can one say its a waste of money, have you read - Die for that high? or how's about - Karma? I`m sure you haven`t, Its easy to write bad things about people when you really don`t have a clue, how's about writing about something that you do know about, I know I for one recommended this book to people, Does that make me wrong?I found this book to be most wonderful, regardless of what one single person thinks."
1,Not worth buying,Not at all what I expected. This was not interesting at all and should have been listed under 'textbook' category.
5,an amazing futuristic thought-provoking movie,"A very interesting look at future new york, complete with multicolored skies and Fresh Kill, the Staton island dumping site. Further thought provoking with a lack of race distinction among family groups, it is one of the only movies i have seen that has a lesbian couple at the center of it, but it couldn't be called a lesbian movie. Rather, a futuristically surreal movie that just happens to have two lesbians as the main characters. I highly recomend this movie."
1,Just say no!,"This was a waste of my money. You can get better test patterns etc. from the THX Optimizer on select Star Wars DVDs. Unless you are looking for the absolute basics, steer clear of this one."
5,Great shoes!,These shoes look very sexy on and are pretty comfortable for the height. Very reasonably priced and well worth it! Just don't wear them if it is wet outside as they are suede. You will definately get compliments with these.
3,"Good tips,not bad, but lacking on photos in the right places","This is a great book for getting tips and learning what kind of tree or shrub you should plant and how to plant it, especially if you are planting hedges and well-placed trees, but on the Suggestions pages there are no accompanying photos, which is the only serious downfall of this book, but it's a really major one --- obviously, you want to see what they're recommending. There's lots of other photos, but they don't serve the purpose well, whereas the photos of the suggestions could have been 85% of the photos needed along with some spot photos here and there. I still think you should buy it as you will learn a lot (I sure did), but if you want to see pictures of the suggestions, you'll need another book. Wish I could suggest one for trees, but for shrubs, it's easy --- Taylor's 50 Best Shrubs was far and away the best I could find."
3,Arrived with minor print flaws,"A number of pages did not have proper color registration (blurring of images and text) upon arrival, even though the book was sold as new. Otherwise recommended as good source of information for placement of trees and shrubs to allow them to mature without crowding lot lines, streets, and house foundations."
3,a late release,"Why does a book on AutoCAD 2002 come out in 2005? Especially when there is already AutoCAD 2005 out, and AutoCAD 2006 will be released soon? The tardiness of this book is a little strange.Ok, if you are new to AutoCAD, then you need to learn the basics. And in all probability, the majority of the book's explanations about the 2002 version will apply to the 2005 and 2006 versions. AutoCAD has been out long enough that the basics of two and three dimensional modelling are well established and stable. So the book won't be a total loss, if you already have it.Then again, if you haven't gotten the book, try a different, more up to date version. You should not have to get a new book for every AutoCAD annual revision. But getting a more recent book means that you can usefully retain it longer than this 2002 book."
4,Great ideas for better portraits,"Taking portraits is a hobby of mine. I have a studio set up in my house. The author has really good ideas for improving portraits. Although I already have about 6 other books on portraiture, I'm learning good things from this book. He shares simple tips from his years of experience. It's better than most of the other books I've already got. Many examples of poses are given which I am finding helpful."
1,Hard to read,"I'm not sure what people are looking for in this book. I found that the many grammar mistakes and spelling mistakes are beyond my mental effort to fix. I also find it hard to keep up with where I was actually reading. The visuals are great but, you have to look around to see where you were and where you need to go next. I would love to get my money back on this one! Sorry, I cannot recommend this book. To the editors, try spell check,it works!"
2,"Good photographer, but book is poorly organized and written.","The photographer seems to know his stuff, very well, and I'd like to learn from him. But this book isn't the way to do it. It's just poorly organized, hard to follow in places, typos, casually refers to terminology & concepts that aren't described until later in the book, and some other things that I simply couldn't figure out (and I have a very good track record with academics). 1/2-way through the book I couldn't take anymore, and gave up."
3,"Good information, not well presented","After leafing through this book in a photo store I bought it. It seemed to offer a pretty comprehensive introduction to lighting and posing for portraits... exactly what I wanted.Having now read much of it, I'm still fairly satisfied with its coverage but I'm very disappointed with how poorly it is written and edited. The book is difficult to understand at times, offering little stumbles with spelling and grammatical errors, as well as major trip-ups with contradictory or unclear or - in at least one case - incorrect advice. Re-reading is frequently required to divine the author's intent, a task sometimes made more difficult by the bad design of the book which plops text all over the pages like a magazine more devoted to advertising than information.I'm new to serious study of portrait photography, and so learned a lot from this book. However I would hesitate before buying another Lark publication... they apparently don't have editors or spell-checkers."
5,Energy and Simple Sophistication,"While I'm sure there is a long and rich history which the Heartless [...] draw on and into which they fit - I know none of it. What I do know is that this album is truly amazing.There is a necessary simplicity to a band's music when it only contains three members, but the Heartless [...] manage to be both energetic and sophisticated; there's definitely more going on than you'll find after just a casual listen.With only 10 tracks, there isn't a single bit of filler. Wennerstrom's vocals are really amazing too. I highly recommend giving these guys a listen."
5,Always sounds fresh,"I've listened to All This Time at least once a week since its release. Unlike other albums I played heavily initially, this one continues to connect. Erika Wennerstrom writes strong songs sung with a powerful, honest and haunting voice; on All This time her growth is obvious. I recommend this highly, as I do seeing them live."
4,"Great music, not so great recording quality","After I heard the NPR story on the Heartless [..], I ran out to get their new CD. Erika Wennerstrom has an incredible voice and a knack for writing songs that stick in your head. Listen to ""Came a Long Way"" and ""All This Time"" for a good taste of what they do. My only complaint is the recording quality - it almost sounds like it was recorded in a barrel. The bass guitar is too heavy, and the bass is boomy."
3,Some sophomore jinx at play here,"Not as strong as the first CD. Not as bluesy. For some reason, the record engineering seems sub-par as well."
3,Note that this is a novel,"I downloaded this for Kindle because I thought it was non-fiction. The title does not indicate that it is a novel, and neither does anything else. It seems OK for a novel, but I am not into fiction and so I will remove this review if and when someone wants to review it as a novel."
2,DIDN'T EXPECT A NOVEL,Maybe I missed reading the reviews about this book. I want to learn more about how my Puritan ancestors lived in early days of Massachusetts and Connecticut.
1,Poor Reliability,"I bought this card as an alternative to the expensive name brand cards. However, after a couple of uses the card would intermittently lose it's formatting and would have to be reformated so my camera or computer would recognize it. Of course, when reformatting, all of the pictures that were stored on the card were lost."
4,Red Planet is Red-tacular,"Red Planet was a surprisingly good read. Most books based on movies seem to be shallow, but Red Planet created a good atmosphere, and I actually *wanted* to read it. I haven't seen the movie, so I don't really know how it compares, if it adds to, or takes away from the story. It seems that parts of the plot are rather farfetched. Namely, sending an ex-military robot on a mission to Mars, with all it's military programming intact seemed to be something so extrememly stupid that even space agencies wouldn't do it. The whole 'Save Earth by terraforming Mars' plot seems to just be a story thrown together as an excuse to send people to Mars. Overall, it has little impact on the story as it becomes a battle to survive."
4,Pretty good book,"Lately there have been a lot of this kind of story in the movies: Going to a planet, something goes wrong, all hell breaks loose, etc. A lot of scifi suspense movies, if you will. Mission to Mars, Pitch Black, etc. There have been a lot in general, actually. This is the first book that I've read along those lines, and this is pretty good. There's a lot more depth in any book, of course, but this really shows the genre in a new light. I can't say it was the best scifi I've read, Dune holds that honor (and with good cause), but this one ranks in the top twenty or so. Well worth a read!"
3,Pretty good...,"Never have I seen the movie, nor do I want to, but Telep's good at adapting movies for books (Wing Commander was a great novelization). I enjoyed it, and hope Pilgrim Truth gets published one of these days."
4,A slice of history from an often overlooked nation's view,"Currently there is no better introduction to the cultural,historical events that took place in the Charpatian-Basin, than Mr. Simon's work. Although the same topic were discussed in other publications, this reissued version offers a bonus alternative."
2,Gunwale mounted boat step,"The frames on the older versions of this were likely chrome plated castings, and as such were more substantial. The problem with these is that the frames are stamped from stainless steel sheet, and are not stiff enough to fully compress the rubber pads, resulting in a gap between the frame and the gunwale. While it doesn't look too bad, I ripped a pair of shorts on the corner of one of these while climbing into the boat."
2,"Great Books, DVD's lack","I am going to be really brief here, but I think the books are great in content and Bible study leading your students from session 1 to session 6 with great intentions, but they are partnered with these DVD's that have very little content and no flow to them. They are short clips that have one youth guru saying something under a minute. Not really discussion starters either."
3,Nice model but not for the modeling novice.,"I just finished building this kit today and finally breathed a sigh of relief! It should really be a Skill Level 3 kit. The fit is terrible in the wings and engine nacelles, but the most annoying fit problem for me was with the anti-sway brackets on the pylons. They don't fit...That's all there is to it. Be prepared to have to sand down all 22 of the brackets. Even then I had to leave some of them off because I couldn't get the weapons payload to attach to the pylons with the anti-sway brackets in the way. I'm still a rookie when it comes to using filler, but I had to use it on this kit and, luckily, it came out not too bad. When the model was completed, it looked rather nice. That's why I would give this kit 3 stars out of 5. I've said it earlier but it must be said again: You will HAVE to use contour putty and do lots of sanding for this kit to look even remotely nice."
3,Decent kit with some shortcomings,"Overall this would be a relatively easy kit to assemble, however several issues created frustration for me and my son as we assembled this together.There were several areas where components did not fit properly (the anti-sway brackets mentioned in other reviews are a good example). We also ran into problems with the engine intakes feeling poorly supported and they came loose inside the engine and were rather difficult to reposition and fix.The biggest issue, however, was that despite the airborne picture on the front of the box, this kit is only has a ground configuration (with canopy up and landing gear down). The canopy can be reconfigured relatively easily, however the landing gear is another matter. Attempting to place the nose gear panels in the airborne configuration resulted in large noticable gaps.PROS: good looking kit; good instructions; mostly easy to assemble.CONS: no airborne configuration; a few ill fitting parts that create frustration."
2,pieces don't fit properly in places,"Instructions for the nose gear are not clear, the pieces that make this section do not fit properly. Makes it more frustrating that it needs to be. In comparison to other model kits out there, this one is more poorly designed."
2,Only works as RAID controller of multiple drives,"I was upgrading a six-year old PC with a larger hard drive. Since all new SATA drives conform to the newer 300 MB/s specification (at least), I wanted to add a hard drive interface to take advantage of the increased speed of the new drive (which was not supported by the motherboard SATA connections). I installed this board according to the instructions, but found that it only works with RAID configurations of two or more drives, which was not indicated in the product description. The supplied documentation is very weak, and Belkin's web site has no support for this product. If theres is a work-around to get this board to work with a single drive, I could not find it. (And after practicing law for 22 years, I know how to go through a document with a fine-toothed comb.)"
1,Disappointed,I bought it as a Christmas gift. My son is very disappointed because it does not work. I will be returning it this week
2,"Great book, but it fell apart.","I bought this book two years ago and it started falling apart soon after. After two years, I has completely fallen apart. The glue on the binding just has not held. The book is invaluable to me as a tool in my practice, but I am afraid to buy another paperback version. Amazon did give me a $10 credit, though."
2,ebook is terrible!,"This book is one of my college text books, and I wanted to save some money and have the convenience of using this book on my Kindle Fire. I downloaded it and all I got was the title page. Each subsequent page after the title just says the name of the book, and it wont scroll through pages.I have tried to delete the item from my devise and redownload it about 5 times now and each time it downloads the same issue is happening.The only reason this did not get only 1 star is because I managed to download it just fine onto my Ipod touch, which makes for a pretty terrible viewing experience."
5,The Complete Printmaker,"Terrific overall guide. Clear instructions with many examples of each technique.After checking this book out of my local library and multiple renews, I ordered my own copy."
2,VERY DISAPOINTED,"I ordered the 5 piece ble set on MARCH 18th and still haven't received this. I keep on getting an email that it is on back order and I now won't get it until JUNE 30th. Costumer service is ridiculous, I was told it would take 3-5 days that's why I ordered it. DON't get it, if you need it within one year"
4,missing the point!,"people dismissing this book because it does not provide step by step instructions are entirely missing the point of Brian and the other designers motivation in this book. You only have to look at a quote from him to see what I mean...""If you want to develop an individual look to your work, my advice is not to take the accepted capabilities of a piece of software. Decide what you want to achieve first, and figure out a way of making it happen."" - Brian TaylorThe book is inspirational, it shows what can be achieved, I find it strange that people expect a step-by-step account of how to create a work of art?!?!"
2,Unfortunate...,"I'm a little disheartened by this book. I had high hopes, and have enjoyed a number of Friends of Ed books. Photoshop and 3D was dissappointing. It did not offer anything of substance what so ever. The artists' essays were shallow, and the tutorials, even worse. The book needed to be twice as long as it was to adequately cover the material, and it would have been nice if the 3D programs used were standardized. Unfortunately what you end up with is a confusing mix of 3D programs, that are only lightly touched on, and almost non-existant Photoshop coverage. Screen shots were sparse, and more often than not were very confusing (i.e. short passages refer to shots on other pages)."
5,Nice outdoors style shorts,"I think the first time I got these shorts it was from a sporting goods store. These shorts have an outdoors adventurer type of feel to them, and quite comfortable. After a few months the snap-button pops loose easily so I wish it had a standard button instead. But these are still the best shorts I've found in a while so I bought a whole bunch when I found out I can get them on Amazon too..."
2,Is it counterfeit?,"The product is what my wife wears. The packaging looks real, but the scent does not compare with that bought at ULTA where 1 ounce cost $72. Here was 2.5 ounces of the same prodcut for under $50.Amazon was terrific in refunding my purchase price. I can't help but feel this product was either a knock-off, or very old.In the end, you usually get what you pay for.Kudos to Amazon for standing up for the customer."
1,Shalimar Eau De Parfum,"Shalimar is the only perfume/cologne I wear, mainly because my husband loves it. I ordered this because it was sold by Amazon and not an Amazon merchant, and it was a great price. I opened it today and it is either fake, or a very old bottle. It doesn't smell at all like Shalimar. I am not worried that Amazon will refund my money, just disappointed that I have to hassle with getting a refund. I ordered it going by the positive reviews, so maybe this was just a fluke. Still, ""buyer beware!"""
1,Shalimar,This product is not the same as I have ordered before. The color was lighter and the smell was not the same.
5,Shalimar Perfume,"I have loved Shalimar since my teens and I am delighted with my purchase. I am always finding the exact thing I want at Amazon, that I cannot seem to find reasonably at other sites."
5,"I wish Amazon.com was ""scratch & sniff!!""","I've loved Shalimar since I was in college. It's not just beautiful, but evocative of sentimental memories. If you've worn it yourself, ladies, you know what I'm talking about.If you are anxious to try it or use it again, get it from Amazon now. Check around at all the department stores in your area and you'll see that this is a great price.Free shipping makes it that much more delightful!"
1,Guerlain Shalimar,"I used to buy Shalimar for my wife many years ago and thought it might be a nice idea to start the habit again. What we received came in came in a nice spray bottle just like what I ordered, Shailmar labels and all. However the scent certainly wasn't that of the Shalimar that my wife and I remembered. I e-mailed Tuccini who provided it and their only reply was that they just shipped what had been provided by the manufacturer. This is of course, believable. Still, It doesn't have the scent that we were expecting. I just don't know what to do about it. Could both our sense of smells have changed over the years? We're in our eighties now. Can you help??"
1,Sewer Shalimar,"Upon receipt of the Shalimar perfume, we opened it. It had a terrible smell! I immediately read the invoice concerning returns. It stated perfume products could not be returned.I called the Customer Service number and explained the situation Initially, I thought I was going to get a brush-off, but I was mistaken and we had the return instructions completed. She was very nice and treated me graciously. Unfortunately, I failed to get her name.The return was completed without incident.Bill Loeffler"
5,sturdy,"I bought this at 1/2 price during christmas. The quality was great for the price I paid. Don't know if it has been used yet, but do wish I had bought myself one. Quick shipping."
4,Came quickly and is perfect for what my son is using it for,This item was packed very carefully and all the drawers where there. My son uses it for his legos and is just perfect for that. Price was good and reasonable and very happy with it.
2,Flimsy,The unit is so flimsy that it wont stay upright on level ground. Had to prop it up against a wall.
2,not pleased,I ordered this in sept. 2012 the plastic drawers are NOT clear is in the pictures but cloudy semi transparent. the bottoms of the drawers are warped out making them hard to slide in and out. also if you dont mount the unit on a wall it tips over very easily and all the drawers slide out. I bought 2 of these I will keep them because it would be to much of a hassle to return them.
4,exactly as advertised,"You get what you pay for! This product is plastic. Not steel. Yes, you can see through drawers just fine. Will is stand on its own? No, it will not. It is simply not wide enough. It will need to be wall mounted or if sitting on something the top will need to be secured. I have mine wall mounted and filled with heavy nuts and bolts and it works great. I ordered dividers at the same time. If you need them you should do the same. Custom making them is tedious and frustrating. Don't ask more than this product can deliver and you will be very happy with it."
2,Deceptive picture!!,"The drawers are cheap soft opaque plastic, as opposed to what is shown in the picture, which shows hard clear plastic. I find these cheap opaque drawers flimsy and much hard to view contents and I suspect the sides could warp over time as well. The drawer stops are also weak and there is a lot of wiggle in the drawers when opened.I bought the 39 drawer and the 60 drawer cabinet by stack-on, and while in concept these are perfect sizes for my needs, I've returned them in search for better quality drawers (as well as a more durable body.)****** Update 2012: Needless to say, 4 years later, the product description still has the deceptive picture alluded to in my original submission 4 years ago.******"
3,Plastic,I know i ordered this but i am disappointed. I remember when they were solid and metal. Plastic is so much more flimsy.
3,Bursting with ideas to add class in your life!,An innovative concept to help one better one's self by raising the ceiling of your own cultural expectations and have it soar to the sky. One's perception of self stagnates unless you see how others live their lives so you can be content or change your life. This book does that. Hope you are content!
2,NothingNew,"Not a bad read... a little, well a lot, dated. Kinda gives you a break down of things you already know... well, you should."
5,Great Book,This book had a lot of good information in it. It provides information just as the title describes. Realistic ideas are in the book that would help someone meet and fit in more comfortabley with the rich and upper end clients.
5,So wonderful- great stories and beautiful pictures,"I loved all of the stories of each of these saints. This book tells each saint's specialty, history, and how to ask for help. It really crosses all religious boundaries- can be enjoyed by any faith. The original drawings are exquisite and bring the stories to life. It is a perfect gift to give during the holidays. I am buying multiple copies to bring as a gift to all the holiday parties I'll be attending. Absolutely wonderful!"
4,the other reviewer is insane,"uhmmmmm...the other reviewer who posted about ""not much halloween going on here"" obviously, did not listen, at all.I can hear a lotta lotta halloween samples, from the disney halloween album to a vincent price spoken word album I have in ""magic dub."" marvel as your party goers get into the groove & then duck as a shreak goes through the grooove!so you'll get a whole lotta halloween and a big fat plate 'o dub as well. what a great concept! holds true for mbm fans too, I think they are one of the few who could pull it off. I think it's the best tino corp album out there, I'm gonna buy it on vinyl so I can get some extra thick basssssss."
4,"It dawned on me, time after time, again and again.",I was amazed. Totally flattened. Saw the DVD 4 Times in a row and found new ideas for me again and again. Cool tricks to improve too. I love it. Only flaw: Camera work needs a little improvement. Some angles could be better. 4 of 5 stars from me !
1,Not real informative.,"For the first time since reviewing books from Sports Publishing Inc. I was disappointed with the overall writing of a book. This book is a compilation of pictures and quotes of a rising superstar in the world of Major League baseball.While the book is filled with dozens of photos and some of the chapters are interesting, for the most part the book lacks any real story line. The book does not talk about the career of Derek Jeter nor the authors examine Jeter in comparison with other great shortstops of the past.The book would make a great gift to a true New York Yankee fan but true baseball purists will find this book sorely lacking any real value. The price is $24.95 and for the money you get very little.Overall you could and can spend your dollars more wisely on other baseball or sports books. Sports Publishing has a great website and if you spend a few minutes there you will find a whole host of sports treasures."
4,Nice pictures,This book is full of pictures and stories that are interesting; stories about his signing out of high school; pictures and highlights of outstanding plays in his years with the Yankees who have won three series since he arrived.
5,A Great Blessing!,"Prayer has always been an important tool for anyone of the faith. Prayers sung only increases the depth of one's prayer life, and brings us closer to our Creator.In this work, we have laid out for us an entire year of Sunday Vespers.The work is concise and easy to use, no flipping through pages in confusion; each Sunday Vesper is clearly marked, written on two adjoining pages, so the book can be opened and easily followed by all those joining in prayer.This is a must have for those who wish to join in with others around the world in prayer and unity. A great work that the entire family, friends and fellow prayer companions, can follow along and share in the experienceA beautiful book and a great aid to your prayer life. Recommended!"
