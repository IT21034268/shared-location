5,an excellent book for language learners at any level,"This book is excellent. I have used it for years. I just recently bought another one as the old one was getting old. It is straightforward and well-written. It is simple and easy to use. It moves the reader/language learner from the basics to the more advanced stages. It is also very communicative. It is also very non-threatening. I have used so many other books, and found that this is probably the best Japanese textbook I have ever used. Even textbooks used at most colleges are not this good as they often do not take a communicative approach. Japanese should be seen as a language which any person at any age can learn. I have the tapes and I would recommend that you too buy them (if you can find them... not on amazon...OOP). I would recommend that you also watch Japanese television or movies with subtitles to help you also get used to the sounds and conversations. This book may go out of print one day, so I do recommend you pick one up yourself."
5,Truly outstanding introduction to Japanese,"I'm currently an exchange student to Japan, and this book did wonders for my Japanese ability. The only ""complaint"" I have is that there is no ""Japanese for Everyone 2"" ... when I finished this book, I searched forever to find a book that could pick up where this left off.Japanese for Everyone covers in one volume what many series cover in three. I use Japanese in my everyday life as an exchange student, so I know first hand- this book is a blessing."
5,Listen the the Carrie Fisher Commentary,"I've always loved this film. It has great dialog, great casting, great production and direction. Carrie Fisher wrote the screeplay based on her book, and her commentary on the film is very insightful, honest and funny. She discusses her rehab from drug addiction and her relationship with her mother, Debbie Reynolds. She points how the film differs from her real relationships with her family, discusses the writing process and how she had never written a screenplay before and wasn't sure how to do. And, of course, she's very funny on top of everything else. Buy the movie because its a good movie. The commentary is the icing on the cake."
4,Meryl saves this disaster.,Meryl's character isn't really allowed to blossom and/or shine among the equally uninteresting characters she has to work with. I wouldn't have finished watching it but for her valiant effort to break through the muddy material.
5,entertaining and inspiring at the same time,"Postcards from the Edge is fantastic. Streep and Maclaine bring biting human qualities to the shallow world of Hollywood...realistic, moving, hysterical and first rate performances. Excellent, excellent, excellent."
1,It was defected & I could not watch it.,"I ordered several movies when i ordered this one, but apparantly this one was defected and i could not watch it."
1,Product Defected and Other Issues,"First problem was that I was sent 2 copies and charged for both when I only ordered one. I decided to keep both only because I liked the movie and thought the second would make a great gift. I finally opened MY copy last night to watch it for the first time (it was ""factory sealed,"" mind you) and the DVD was totally screwed up: The lighting kept changing from bright to dark and in several spots the DVD just went totally black! What a waste of money! Wish I hadn't kept both copies now...That's a wasted $25 down our already anemic economic drain...I'm thinking twice about buying DVD's from Amazon again."
1,dvd,"the dvd was loose from the circle holder, it rattled around inside the case no way to put it back seeing as this was gift. not good"
5,One of my all time favorite movies,"Entertaining from start to finish. Carrie Fisher is brilliant, flawed and perfect. Wonderful tale, told on screen by an amazing cast. A movie to be watched over and over again."
4,"Magic, mayhem and Merlin can be found in this new jem.","Anthony is seen as a villain by the people of Abandon Island. His brother, who lived on the island, recently died, and Anthony is selling Abandon to a powerful politician in return for certain child labor laws to be pushed in Parliament. Morwenna is a resident of the island. She fears the advent of new ownership. The new owner's hunting lodge will be built over old standing stones, and the traffic of his friends will destroy the fishing industry and leave some two hundred people without work. Morwenna's father was an Arthurian scholar, and she is trying to complete the manuscript he was working on before his death. She is also looking for Merlin's cave, rumored to be on the island. And all the while, she is trying to talk Anthony out of selling the island while trying to ignore her attraction too him... not too successfully.... Morwenna is a fabulous character with her many cats and her belief in magic. You'll believe, too."
4,Puffy Wall Art,"I am quite pleased with this wall art that coordinates with the bubbles and fish bedding set. The wall art is puffy (think stuffed toy) with a small white ribbon on the top of each piece for hanging. All pieces are machine washable. The size of the fish range from 8 1/2 - 10 inches from tip to tail. The bubbles are about 3 - 3 1/2 inches wide and 7 1/2 inches long. I do wish, however, that there were more color options than just green, blue and orange."
4,The Family Under The Bridge,I like this book because it is nice and I enjoyed it. Also it is kind of sad.This book is good you should read it.
2,Cute story with difficult vocabulary for kids,"This book, set in Paris in late December follows a hobo named Armand, who's gruff on the outside, but reveals his inner warmth when he finds a newly homeless family living under ""his"" bridge. While this book does have many good points, this isn't a book I would recommend. The story would be very entertaining to a fifth grader but the vocabulary skills and difficulty understanding Paris or gypsies would frustrate a reader in this age group. A sixth grader, however, would more easily comprehend the vocabulary (I admit that I didn't know many of the words and had to guess at their meaning in context--and I don't consider my vocabulary skills poor by any means) and cultural situations but they would be bored by the simplistic story. In all, I would not recommend it not because it is a bad book, but because I think there are better choices out there."
2,From Under the Bridge Into his Heart!,"A Paris hobo named Armand prizes both his ragtag existence and the hardness of his heart. But he falls victim to the charms of three redheaded waifs--newly on the streets (or in this case, under the bridge of the River Seine) whom he discovers camping out in His spot, no less! This is more than any gentleman of the road should have to endure! Then too, the children's prideful, bitter mother is no prize. But with the aid of friendly gypsies and their generous cart, plus a pal who recreates Father Christmas, Armand struggles to keep the children warm, fed and sheltered. But how can he deliver the real house which he boasted about for them to live in? This short tale of human kindness in adversity reminds jaded adults of the simple trust of children. A Good read-aloud for the elementary level."
3,thoughtful book for young readers,I read this book a long time ago. I recommend it to children younger than 12. It gives a different reflection on life. There is definitely better books for young readers but this book is okay too.
4,Disappointing binding,"The story is great, quite enjoyable to read with our son. I am disappointed with the binding, it's basically a paperback book with hard covers. Not good quality paper for the text block at all, not sure it's worth it buying the hardcover if the inside pages will yellow and turn brittle over time like paperbacks do."
5,Light From Heaven-Mitford series #9,"Another wonderful read from the Mitford series. All of Jan Karon's books are comfy, cozy and make you feel at home."
4,A delightful ending to a fine series,"Jan Karon's Mitford series was my introduction to this type of spiritual fiction; and a lovely introduction it has been. I will miss the wonderful characters, especially Father Tim Kavanagh, who taught me how easy it is to pray. This final book in the series doesn't leave you with a sense of finality; but more a kind of feeling that now we can all go on together. Thank you Ms. Karon for a lovely book and a lovely spirit."
4,review from light from heaven,"Great book, sad to see it end as the series. Definitely, great to see the lead character find his ""place""."
2,Time to quit,"Plodding, disappointing writing that lacks the character development and depth of the earlier books."
3,Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9),I was not aware that I was getting audio book. I wanted regular book. But it arrived in good condition in a reasonable time.
3,Light from Heaven (Mitford Years),"Simply put, if you liked the others in the Mitford series, you'll like this. Its predictable, but a nice escape."
5,Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9),"When I started reading The Mitford Years #1, I couldn't put it down until I finished book #8. The story keeps you glued and you feel you know and love Father Tim and his wife personally. I was happy to find that there was a book #9 which brought the whole series to a close. You have to start at the beginning, but it's well worth the read."
3,Light fromHeaven,"I have enjoyed reading all of Jan Karon's Mitford years books; however, I was a little disappointed with the final book. Ms Karon seemed a little lax with the continuety of the story. I also felt this book a little ""preachy"" and less concerned with telling a story. I really enjoyed, however, the memorial service - what a hoot!"
2,Dissatisfied with this Final Mitford Book,"I join others who said this book left them wanting. It was quite disappointing. I had hoped with this last book, all the ""ends tied up"" would be with the characters we have known for the whole series. I couldn't keep all the new people straight. I was hoping for more of Dooley as a young man. Nope. Puny has a new set of twins, and it was barely mentioned. Edith Mallory found God? Why? We don't know. BIG SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!!! And after searching all over for Kenny, he just happens to show up at Fr Tim's door!?! I just shook my head at that. It seems Ms. Karon wanted to get this book out of the way, so she could get on with the new Father Tim novels. I hope they will be like the first 5 books of the Mitford series."
3,A little disappointing,"I've read all of the Midford series and enjoyed all of them. However, I suppose my expectations were too great for this last book of the series. To me, this book was the least enjoyable. Too many new characters and too much mountain talk. Just got boring after a while. I would still buy this book though and I'm so sorry to see this series come to an end. I feel that I am losing some old and cherished friends. Jan Karon is a great writer and in my mind she is Cynthia Kavanaugh!"
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. She seems to have gotten bored with her characters. I have loved all the previous books, but it seems like someone forced her to write this one. Very disappointing. Very disjointed."
2,Disappointed,Jan Karon's writings are among the best I've read - that's why this last book I found disappointing - very slow and I couldn't identify/relate to Agnes or with Father Tim's relationship with her. Maybe the author was trying to replace or reinvent Miss Sadie.
2,Disappointing Ending to a Wonderful Series,"Like the other reviewers who were disappointed in this final Mitford book, I was looking for a final visit with the Mitford characters we have come to know and love. Introducing a whole new list of characters was not appropriate for this final book of the series. I found it hard to keep my interest engaged."
2,How Disappointing,"The first few books of the Mitford series were wonderful, but the last two have been such disappointments. I love the Mitford story line, but Light from Heaven was so dis-jointed, it felt like JK got tired of writing and just haphazardly jotted down some disconnected thoughts. I really expected more -a gread deal more - from an author who clearly can touch the hearts of her readers, but really missed the mark this time."
2,I could cry.,This last book in the series was so boring and dull I could cry because I had looked forward with such anticipation to it. I think Ms. Karon was bored with this series and it showed. It appeared this book was just an obligation to her contract.
5,Worth the price,I very rarely buy hardback editions because of the cost but couldn't wait for a paperback version. I was not dissapointed! This finally episode of The Mitford Years wraps up every loose end up beautifully and gives the reader even more insight into the lives of a group that now feels like my own family. Have kleenex handy; I started sniffling on page nine and and didn't stop for the rest of the book.
3,All Good Things Must Come To An End,"I tend to agree with many of the readers' comments and was myself a bit disappointed in the last book of the beloved Mitford series; however, I am justing putting it down to the ""all good things must end"" therory. It's hard for me to be too critical because the whole series in itself provided us all with such a wonderful reading experience. It's hard to say goodbye to the Mitford characters; they are like old friends. So, athough, not a spectacular ending to a great and wonderful series, I'm just grateful to have had the whole Mitford experience to begin with. Whenever I feel the need to have a ""Mitford moment,"" I will open the first book when Father Tim meets Barnabus, eat a bite with the gang at Percy's grill, or enjoy a few moments reading the friendly banter between Father Tim and Emma ~~~~ now, there's the rub.....it doesn't get any better than that :-) ! Goodbye to the fine folks of Mitford....I, for one, shall miss you all."
2,I tried,"For someone who is reading the whole series at one time, this book might be great. But when I read this book, it had been over two years since I'd read the one before it, and I could not even finish it. I tried to stick with it, but I eventually put it down and could not pick it up again. Is this not the conclusion to the MITFORD series? So why can't a poor reader read about MITFORD instead about a bunch of characters we know nothing about, who we won't get to know very well seeing as this is the last book. I am a big fan of the whole series, but this book was simply painful."
2,Let down,"I, too, have read all the books in the series, and this one was a big disappointment. I decided to come here to read the other reviews to see if I was missing something. I still don't get it. Don't care about the new characters. Do enjoy Tim and his wife - especially finding each other so ""late"" in life. But generally, the book was a disappointment. I don't think I ""got"" the last chapter.One more thing - does it bug anyone else that Jan Karon's favorite word seems to be ""thumped"" as in, he ""thumped"" onto the chair. I found myself cringing each time I read that. She also used it constantly in previous books.If you have the whole series, buy it, but otherwise, don't bother. Doesn't live up to expectations."
1,What a letdown!!,"Like others, I had to force myself to read this book to the end as it was about characters I didn't really care about. The constant use of hymns, prayers and poetry was boring and perhaps a way to stretch the book to fufill a publishing contract. It would have been far better to address readers' questions about Dooley, Kenny and Lace in the previous book and ended the series at that point. This was a hugely disappointing book as the characters loved in Mitford made essentially brief and shallow appearances. Jan Karon herself appears to have been bored with Mitford and this lazy effort cheats the loyal reader of a satisfying end to the series. I will not be reading the Father Tim novels and believe Jan Karon's reputation is lessened by her milking the series this way. Don't waste your money. Check this one out of the library."
3,"Great book, I guess","I've read most of this series & feel that thankfully, it's over ! I never got into the characters & the final book awaits my attention....have given it as a gift to persons who truly enjoyed....for myself, give me a mystery like Joanna Brady & J P Beaumont from J.A. Jance and Murder, She Wrote from Donald Bain & don't forget Stephanie Plum from Janet Evanovitch.I think what I'm saying is that this series was definitely for the persons to whom I gifted. Jan Karon kept their interest & they eagerly looked forward to the next book. On their behalf, thank you for an excellent series."
1,Deeply Disappointing,I agree with all of the reviewers who were disappointed in this book. What I had hoped for was a final visit to Mitford with stories about all my favorite characters and a nice tying up of loose ends. Instead we are introduced to a myriad of new characters who aren't very interesting especially as this is the final book in the series and their stories will go no further. What was Ms. Karon thinking? I wanted so much for the final book in the Mitford series to be about Mitford! Definitely wait and get this book from the library - its not worth adding to your Mitford collection.
5,Jan Karon never fails to deliver!,"I just finished reading Jan Karon's last book in The Mitford Series, A Light From Heaven, and I kept hoping it would never end. Every book in this series, in my estimation, was as good as, or better than, the previous one. The first one in her next series about Fr. Timothy Kavanaugh is on my bedside table; and even though I've just recently begun reading it, I can tell it's another great book by this lady! For those of you familiar with the Mitford Series, I have just bought my granddaughter the first of the children's books about Cynthia's sweet little white cat, Violet. Again, another wonderful book!Happy reading,Judy"
1,Very disappointed,"This book was a real disappointment. It just quits and does not tie up the story. The reader is left hanging. I was reading it on the airplane and thought that I had misplaced my bookmark and missed the completion of the story, but no I hadn't - it isn't completed. I felt the author just became tired of writing the book and quit. The previous book was also not as well written as the others and I won't buy another by this author."
4,Light from Heaven book 9 - Book 10 needed to complete what was omitted,"Father Tim was the perfect person to go into the mountain to Holy Trinity and get it started again after 40 years being closed. This book covered many new people and many of the people we feel we know in the town of Mitford. It covered Dooley finding out about his the money Miss Sadie left him and now he can plan to be a vet and also have his own business.I was disappointed in the end when all those years they have been looking for Kenney - On last page he shows up and Father Tim said "" We were looking for you"" without even mentioning his name and taking him into the house to show the joy of all the others there for the Christmas program.Can Jan Karon write Book 10 and finish what she left off?"
4,A Pleasant Read,"I bought this book in hardcover as soon as it was out. I enjoyed reading it, but I have to say that I was a little let down at the end, not just because it is the last in the series. As some of the other reviewers have said, I would have preferred to see more of my favorite familiar characters instead of so many new ones.This is a pleasant read if you are a die-hard Jan Karon fan. The book I'm recommending to friends and will be giving as gifts this Christmas, though, is the one I read right before Light from Heaven, The Christmas Quilt by Jennifer Chiaverini. I'm not a quilter but I loved it."
2,Overrated and overpriced,"This lipgloss was too pale, unflattering, and all nars lipglosses are way too sticky, make my lips peel, smell and taste bad. My go to lip glosses are revlon over the counter lipgloss."
1,Nars Orgasm Lip Gloss...save your money,"$24.00 for a lip gloss, that's a pretty heavy duty price point for a lip gloss. I expect a LOT from gloss this expensive and high end.I ordered a tube of ""Orgasm"" and expected the perfect nude lip. Nope! There just isn't anything about this gloss that impressed me. It was sticky. It wasn't very opaque. There was so little color payoff! I have had comparable (or dare I say, better!) glosses for 1/5th the price. I can't believe I'm about to type this, but L'Oreal makes a gloss a million times better than this at 1/4th the price! Try NYX's glosses at 1/6th the price (and I like them better than the L'Oreal). Please don't buy into the hype of the Orgasm gloss. You won't have an orgasm when you use it, you'll be saying, ""That's it..?"""
4,"Beautiful lip gloss, feels great on the lips","I love this lip gloss. Bought the color Coup de Coeur, and the color is fantastic for my medium-toned, peachy complexion. I bought one for my mom, too, and now she won't wear anything else on her lips!"
2,not a good buy,I bought this because I read that Nars made long lasting lip gloss but this product is just like any other lip gloss to me stays on for maybe one hour or so.
5,Awesome!,"This is the perfect lip gloss, shiny, and stays on forever! I highly recommend this product to anyone for an all day gloss."
3,"Ok, for someone, but not for me","I recently purchased the nars turkish delight and it is definitely not what I expected. It makes my lips looks kind of dead and I am of an medium to olive complexion. Try it on before you buy it, do not just purchase it online like I did."
3,Just okay -- would be 5 star if it didn't stink,"Love the color! But face it, who wants to wear something on their lips that tastes & smells pretty bad? I have to put a strawberry clear gloss over it just to cover that up. But like I said, it is a very nice color though.. and looks different from the bottle color when it's on."
3,Just OK,"This Nars lip gloss is not the rich color of the Orgasm blush, which I use daily. Nars needs to work harder to get the color match better. I would not buy again. Just an OK gloss."
3,All Night Long,"I have this in the ALL NIGHT LONG shade. It is a nice shade: plummy/wine semi-sheer. It goes on nice, but barely lasts fifteen minutes. My biggest gripe aside from the price is that this gloss had a nasty smell and taste. Like burnt plastic. Just YUCK!"
5,"My favorite color, brand","This color is perfect by itself or over any color- it does a great job toning down colors that are too bright. I have one in every purse, in my drawer at work and in my car!!"
5,An astoundingly beautiful recording of duduk music.,"I've been impressed by Minassian's playing with Peter Gabriel and Afro Celt Sound System, and was intrigued when I found he was releasing an album. As a collector of Duduk music (and duduks), I'm utterly astounded at how beautiful this album is. Levon's tone is gorgeous and his accompanists (piano, keyboards, ney flute, violin, tenpur, oud, and percussion) do a wonderful job of complimenting it. Most of the tracks feature Levon's duduk soaring over wonderfully minimal backing tracks, but a few feature some breathtaking vocals courtesy of Roselyne Minassian and Herve Teboul as well. This is the most genuine and successful world music albums I've ever heard."
5,mellow joys,"I was a little nervous that this might be a world music exercise in the worst sense of the phrase, particularly with the other instruments listed, since the duduk is at its best when solo or solo with a drone.However I was very impressed by the whole CD. The playing is first class, and manages to be both mellow and incisive. It is always good to hear other duduk players, apart from Gasparyan, since outside Armenia itself, few other ""names"" appear on the CDs available (although there is a Californian Armenian label - which is available in Armenia but which I have never seen in the UK).Wonderful !"
2,Made in China! Sending it back!,"I am so disappointed that this tote carries Lodge's name and is made in China that I will be sending it back. First of all the Lodge tripod does not come with a tote, so you have to order it separately. I bought the Bayou Classic tripod and it came with a tote bag. I buy Lodge cast iron because it is American made. If the add for the tote clearly stated that the tote was made in China I would not have bought it. Now that I have received it I am sending it back. Very disappointing. No doubt, this is the best tripod tote bag that Chinese child prison labor can produce, but I'll buy American."
3,Great book -- lousy video,"This is a beautiful and sweet story. One lamb has a problem and has to learn that God has a plan for all of us.But the included DVD is a bummer -- way too far from the original story. It introduces a scary mountain lion, and there is a PIG in this Israeli stable... and it's too dark and suspenseful. The book is sweet and light. Stick with the book."
5,I Love This and I Don't Even Have Kids,"Warning: Do not read this in a public place or you will make a fool of yourself. I started reading it in a store out of curiousity and was moved to tears in the middle of the aisle. And trust me, I am the biggest Christmas Crab around. But when I read this I felt like the Winter Warlock in ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" when his big icy heart melts. This is a classic. This needs to be an animated special. Until then, get this book and treasure it. Everyone needs this in their lives."
4,"Very nice video, a little short though","This is a wonderful tale for children about the birth of Jesus. It is told from the perspective of a crippled lamb, who cannot understand why he cannot be strong like his other friends. However, because he is crippled, he was made to stay in the stable where eventually, Jesus is born. It was his job to keep the baby Jesus warm and had he not been crippled, he would have been in the pasture with his friends and not there to be a part of this wonderful event. It teaches self worth, no matter who you are, and that everyone has worth in the eyes of God. Jodi Benson sings beautifully in it and Robby Benson helps with the narration via the camel. It's a very cute story, very captivating, but it could be a tad longer, I would think anyway. Other than that, it's a great buy."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,"I have two girls, ages 4&amp;5. When I read them this book, we all cried together. Max Lucado's, ""The Crippled Lamb"", has got to be one of the finest children's books I've read yet. With it's vivid descriptions of the poor lamb's feelings, and the message of how God turns bad situations into blessings. Thanks to all who worked so hard to put such a wonderful book together. Daniel Oxford, Gravette, AR"
1,"""Crippled"" Has to Go; New Title Needed","While this book may be helpful to children who are seen as ""special"" or ""crippled,"" I would never recommend it, because of the title, which is bad as ""The Nig**er Lamb"" would be. Get it? I'm an advocate for people with disabilities, the preferred term, and can assure you that a book called ""crippled"" and terms like ""special"" will have the opposite of the intended result and could cause children to be perceived even more as ""special"" instead of different but equal."
5,WONDERFUL Story!!!,"My mother bought this book and the DVD for my 2 year old daughter. Both the book & the movie instantly became her favorite -- she'll ask to read the book and watch the movie several times a day.It is a wonderful story that will bring almost anyone to tears (maybe even ""Daddy""!).I highly recommend this book & movie for children of all ages (from 1 to 99)."
5,"A ""must-read"" for children of all ages!","Max Lucado is a ""master illustrator."" He artistically paints pictures with words and ""The Crippled Lamb"" is no disappointment!Little Joshua, a lamb, feels so different from others. He bears spots while others don't. He doesn't have a mom or dad. He can't run, jump and play like the others, for he has a bad leg. Often feeling down on himself, he finds encouragement in a friend named Abigail, an aging cow.Then one unexpected night, Joshua finds that there is a specialness about his differences. There is a unique role only he can fill.Get the tissues ready! This is a book sure to move even the hardest heart. How vividly it portrays the love of a Father Who loves us inspite of our blemishes and sees each one of His children as special, with purpose!Beautifully illustrated by Liz Bonham, this is a work you should not miss. This one is a ""keeper"" you'll wish to pass on from generation to generation."
3,One of French's best,"The full title of the book is THE LAY OF SIR MARROCK AND THE WOLF, and, like all of Allen French's work, a terrific read. I'd rate it only below THE STORY OF ROLF AND THE VIKING BOW. I do wish a publisher would bring the book back into print. It's the story of Sir Marrock, a knight who returns home only to be ensorcelled into the body of a wolf by a faithless wife. The question is whether he can ever return to his own form, and how, even as a wolf, he is able to protect his people from those who would rule them. It's an excellent piece of work. I was referring to the original edition. I didn't mind that this copy was photocopied or scanned from a well-used library book but I was vexed to find the last two or three pages missing."
2,Very poor packaging and documentation,"This is a regretfully mismanaged product. The quality of the disc is acceptable. The quality of the packaging is abysmal. There is no information about the credits for the production. The track listing includes only the track number and the title. No performer names, no timings. in fact, there is no differentiation between the production tracks and the bonus tracks. This CD appears to have been produced by people with no knowledge of the material, nor interest in it. I felt cheated by what I got."
5,faber accompaniment CD,Great tool to help with practicing. Allows the student to experience playing in an ensemble and makes if FUN!!!!
3,Compared to the Foot smart,I think they are roughly the same. I still like the Yasco bunion splint more. I can't walk around the house in the Foot smart or this one. I haven't experienced any toenail pain like others have stated. I guess it depends on how you position it.
2,It did not work for me.,"The product is good, but it dd not work for me. No changes or improvements on my feet."
2,didn't care for it,"well, I have two of these and they end up waking me up at night for discomfort. maybe its the stress on the toe be forced to a different position, but I can't sacrifice sleep at this expense. it is not designed to walk in."
5,VERY GOOD PRODUCT,FIT FOOT VERY WELL. HELPS THE PAIN WHILE YOU SLEEP. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.IT WILL HELP ALIGN YOUR TOE IN TIME. CAN PREVENT FROM HAVING SURGERY
4,Seems to help...,"Trying to put off fixing my bunion, this product seemed like a good possible solution. I've been wearing it nightly for a couple of months, but missed about three days this past week.When I wake up in the morning, my foot looks almost normal. By the end of the day, it is back in it's distorted shape, but I seem to have less pain from the bunion than I did before. And last week, after missing a few days of wear, I had quite a bit more pain in my foot.Overall, it's not a magical cure, but it does seem to be a good way to manage the pain of a bunion. And I am still hoping that over time it will retrain my foot back to a more normal position. I do recommend this product!"
3,Its great - but it BROKE,"Third day I wore it, it broke at the toe guard. However, it was a very comfy fit and I really liked it. I think I may try another one...."
2,not recommend for narrow foot,This product doesn't really suit my narrow foot and keep slipping down. Otherwise I think it might work pretty well.
4,Left better,"This arrived first of two I bought. It was by far the better product having better components a leather big toe guard and sturdier parts. The other for the right foot had cheap foam, cheaper components and not as comfortable."
2,Not comfortable. Look for another splint,"PediFix Nighttime Bunion Regulator, Left, MediumI have what one would consider a 'moderate' type bunion. My toe is not out of alignment that much and the 'bump' is noticeable (5 on a scale of 1-10). I bought this product b/c the pain has increased to the point it will sometimes hurt to walk. (I'm already wearing shoes with a wide toebox and have for 20+ years). This splint seemed to work well the first couple nights but shortly thereafter it wouldn't stay on comfortably. The plastic separator began to uncomfortably dig into the area between my toes.If the point is to leave it on overnight to get good results, the item needs to be comfortable. This was not and I have since thrown it away."
3,Bunion Regulator,"This offers some relief, but it irritates the skin if left on too long.A good value here, though. I saw it in a store for twice the price."
3,August 2011 Review,The applicance is good. One improvement should be to make the velcro strap longer so the adhering surface has a better chance to hold.
1,Didn't work for me,"I was hopeful that this would be the affordable answer to the bunion problem (as opposed to surgery), but this product made my foot more painful than it was already. I stopped using it after about a month and have had better success (or at least less pain) by wearing only comfy shoes (no heels) and swimming/bike riding instead of walking for exercise. I don't recommend it."
5,Delicious!,"Informative AND charming... I just learned three new cooking techniques! Loved Julia Child's shows when I was little (in the 70's), but I had not seen the original show (starting with the beginning episodes.) What a treat! This is a must watch for me, and, I suspect, anyone who aspires to become a more accomplished chef."
5,How wonderful to be able to cook with Julie,"As a youngster, I was quite unaware of the value Julia gave to those who cook. I haven't cooked for many, many years but was inspired after watching this to actually make the dish AND invite guests. How exciting to having something new to look forward to in my life. Instructions are simple and easy to follow.I watched it first, then went shopping and watched again as I was cooking. Excellent."
5,I love it,I seen the movie and then got into the series. Have learned so much from this show. I love it!
5,Julia is a joy to watch!,"I can't believe how much I learned from the FIRST episode of The French Chef! Julia Child makes French cooking amazingly approachable and gratifying. I felt like my best friend was walking me through her favorite recipe. Best of all, Julia thoroughly explains (and demonstrates) techniques that will improve even the simplest of meals. Bon appetit? Bon appetit indeed!"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"This is supposed to be a swing/metal crossover band, but it's really just some rudimentary amateurish Black Sabbath style metal with a singer who makes a really weak attempt at a swing croon. There is no genuine elements of swing in this music, it's just a bunch of talentless metal guys attempting something they have no real grasp of. There isn't even really any genuine elements of metal either, it's basically just stoner/hard rock."
3,Dull story...ok characterizations,"I've read all three Poltergeist books and have to say, unfortunately, that this was the weakest story of the three. I think one of the main problems is that the entire story takes place in the Legacy house and sort of gives the book a claustrophobic feel. Also, the ending is VERY anti-climatic (if you read the book you'll see what i mean). On the plus side, i think the author did a pretty good job of describing the main characters (they did remind me of the tv show)...although he did make a few mistakes (early on he describes Kat as Rachel's 20 year old daughter..he also says that Derek is French Canadian). All in all it's an OK book but not the best (i still think Maelstorm was the best so far). Hopefully another installment will be coming out soon."
2,The shadows between,"The poltergiest: The Legacy book The Shadows Between left me in the dark. Even through the story was interesting to read I had to real follow the plot carefully. The story start with the appearance of a man, David Carson arriving at The Legacy House. Who he is and where he came from is discovered as the story moves on in the book. I am a fan of the series and the books except for this one. It was slow going and for one to understand what is happenning in the story you have to read very carefully or read it a second time. I did enjoy reading the other books in the series but ""The Shadows Between"" left me confused about what was going on. Sorry."
5,Wonderful!,"I have tried probably half of the recipes already and everyone has been delicious! The recipes are easy to make and don't require any special, hard to find ingredients. I highly recommend the strawberry bread! It's divine!"
5,Plain and simple,"Plain and simple says it all. No complicated diagrams, no professional jargon. Each day gets two-pages: one page to log food and excercise, the other to journal your day. Plenty of space to write and very easy to fill out. Although it might be a little large for smaller purses, it's a perfect fit for any gym bag or backpack -- there's hardly any reason to not keep it with you at all times. If you're looking for something to help you keep track of what you eat plus what physical activities you're doing each day, this book is for you."
1,Rocket worth a quarter - Pay $9,"Mini Saturn V RocketThe product picture is much better than the reality. This is a flexible rubber toy worthy to be included in the 25 cent clearance barrel at any 99Cent store. If you are happy paying $2.49 for a toy covered with sticky glue from pealed off price tags, go for it. Just be aware that the shipping on this itty-bitty rocket is going to be $6.55 for a grand total of $9.04. I foolishly bought this mixed into a much larger order and didn't notice the shipping cost. Buyer beware."
3,"Aiken tries something new, and it almost works..","""Castle Barebane"" was another experiment by Joan Aiken. It was her first adult novel to be set in the 19th Century, where an intrepid female reporter runs away to Europe to find her missing half-brother and his naive wife. She finds that the children were abandoned, and that she must care for them until her wayward brother is found. Part of it is a relief from the pressures of an engagement to a scion of a high society family, but it also burdens her. The trio find their way up to an ancient, decaying castle in Scotland, where secrets are unraveled, lies are exposed, and lives are lost, both innocent and wicked. The ending was a bit off, and certain things just didn't seem to work. Not bad though."
3,wish it was a bit longer,"everything is about the jacket is awsome except for the fact im 6'2"" and it doesnt reach down my body as far as i would like."
1,Fell apart on first use!!!,"Like I said, I only used it once and the glue on the sponge backing against the plastic came off after the FIRST USE!!! The ergonomics and ease of application was easy, but they need to find a better way to make the sponge stick. I'm going to try and get my money back."
5,very happy,"Nice rain suit, I am very happy with the purchase. Was afraid the material might be real thin but it wasn't. I've worn it many times in real heavy rain and it has kept me dry."
2,Late-night erotica,"Ever stayed up late one saturday night and been flipping through the channels aimlessly? infomercial, infomercial, wait? what was that. somethin catches your eye. it's griffen drew in a seductive pose with that orgasmic expression on her face. to say one thing ms. drew has those expressions down pat. The storyline is a bit flakey with random lovemaking scenes (which are, quite exquisite) and not-the-greatest actors. It's interesting to see what Edward Albert has done since The Fool Killer (a much better film) with Anthony Perkins. Ah well, an entertaining movie at best ""masseuse"" can only be labelled as one os those 1:00 AM eye catchers."
5,One of the best comedies I've ever seen!,"The begining of the film is just fantastic!Dialogs are really intelligent , and Babs and Segale work very good as a couple. She once more proved her acting and comedy talent . Loved it!"
2,Why bother?,"I heard from the old timers it was a great movie. After reading the reviews of a butchered DVD, I wont even bother ordering it. Amazon doesn't get their cut, a seller doesn't make a sale, I keep some money and the producer can do what Streisand suggested..."
1,LOUSY EDITED VERSION!!!!!,"This has always been one of my favorite Streisand films, but they have made an unbelievably criminal mistake in releasing the edited version. I originally saw this--as a youngster--on late-night (pre-cable) TV, with the ""F word"" intact, and it was absolutely brilliant! This version is crap! PLEASE RELEASE THE ORIGINAL R-RATED FILM!!!!!!"
1,Cutting a film for DVD release is either idiotic or lazy,"OK....the film is great, Segal is in fine schlumpy form as an out of work actor, Babs is terrific and sexier than anyone could believe (then or now) as a sort of call girl/actress. Robert Klein nails his couple scenes. The dialogue is hilarious and the whole movie works great. How do you mess up a dvd release like this...... You give zero extras and you ignore the theatrical R version (that is easily available!) and release the sanitized later PG version? you got it! I know others have mentioned this but I'm shocked the studios would do this. Booooo! (ok i feel better!) The film deserves 4 stars in my opinion, if you can dvr it off cable I would highly recommend. The dvd gets 0.0 stars....Mr Blutarski"
5,Barbra Streisand in The Owl & The Pussycat.,"Streisand is young, beautiful and sexy in this absolutely wonderful movie. It's a true love story. But if you would be offended by seeing quite a lot of flesh, mostly Barbra's, you may not want to buy this movie. LOL. I WANTED to see Barbra, so I bought it and I did. This is a 10 if I ever saw one. Check it out."
2,I'm with the critics -- DON'T CUT IT!!,"Enough reviewers have groused that the verdict is in -- The Owl and the Pussycat WAS a classic that rocked, until the idiot Babs and the Columbia scissor boys got hold of it. If I were Buck Henry, I'd be angry. The majority of people who would be interested in this film ALREADY SAW IT in our relative youth. That means we saw Babs nude and we heard the ""F"" word that had everyone talking, as she tells off a bunch of moochers. More than a few of us need to give Columbia a piece of our minds. This is unconscionable. The nude scene was NOT destroyed, it was BLOCKED from the collar bone down (she was laying in Barney's bed, asking ""Whatdaya think?"" just before Felix joined her. It still exists in the vault. I own a copy with the ""F"" word intact, and in context, it only makes it funny. COLUMBIA, NOW HEAR THIS: GIVE US THIS FILM IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM, OR GIVE US NOTHING!!"
2,Owl Falls Flat,"I was dissapointed when I watched this in DVD format.....It has been edited from the Original version of which I saw when it first hit the Big Screen and later on VHS. There was no mention of this in the techical information portion. I wouldn't of bought it if I had known, and once opened, I couldn't return it. I felt I was Robbed. Usually the DVD is so much better than VHS because it Adds so much More information and Extras....Not this time........I am confused to WHY they edited it to begin with....The movie stood on it Laurels for All these years and now they decide to ""soften"" it........Very unacceptable!"
1,BUTCHERED CLASSIC,"It's amazing how one cut can ruin a film. Well, here's the proof! I can understand why Barbra demanded her topless scene destroyed, but editing the 'F' word in a major key scene is unforgivable. This is a true classic comedy and a beautifully transferred DVD with its heart cut out! There oughta' be laws against this kind of hollywood butchery!"
2,What's happening to DVD's of the 70's????,"I was really shocked and disappointed to find this DVD had been cut... this was one of the best films I saw in the 70's. I also discovered that another great movie, ""Goodbye Columbus,"" has been edited down to a PG since its release on DVD with the original nude scenes deleted. I'm encouraging people NOT to buy or rent these DVD's and to write the studios and complain... it's bad enough that Columbia and Paramount have ruined their own product, but they didn't even have the courtesy to notify buyers that they weren't purchasing the original films. I agree with another reviewer here... we're being robbed."
3,OWL & THE PUSSYCAT DVD CENSORED???,"Finally, one of the funniest STREISAND films Comes to DVD, unfortunately in a PG-EDITED version! Why can't Columbia picture heads let us decide what we can and cannot see? I own the almost unedited R rated VHS copy, and waited for years for it's widescreen DVD debut. Much to my dismay, it finally comes out EDITED!!!! WHY??? Because i wanted the widescreen version i plopped down my $25.00 for it anyway. Transfer is great and i highly recommend this DVD if you don't mind Corporate Censorship! Shame on Columbia Pictures DVD, do they honestly think someone underage will shell out for a movie they probably never heard of?"
3,The studios ruined this movie on DVD!,"When I first saw this movie I thought it was just great. I was EXTATIC that they were FINALLY releasing it on DVD. When I bought the movie and watched it I was EXTREMELY disappointed that things and some language was edited from the movie. The movie to my knowledge was originally rated X way back when and then it was cut down, a nude scene by Barbra, and was rated R. Then it was rated PG with more edited. I thought the whole purpose of the new invention of DVD was to release a movie in it's ORIGINAL FORM....nothing edited. They use the ""F"" word in PG movies today and they cut it from this one?With the way movies are these days I can't believe the stuff they cut was taken out actually was taken out. Columbia you ruined the movie and should of just left it on the shelf!"
1,Didnt understand it,What's so romantic about this movie.The comedy in the movie was exceptable when you got the joke.Didnt like it at all.Sorry Babs
1,Shallow and unprofessional book,"In short: Shallow, not informative and not professional. Suitable to pre-beginners, if ever. No samples at all. I was shoked to realize that I paid so much for this misleading book. To my opinion, Amazon should be more careful with the deceptive reviews that alleged customers write about books. After the great disappointed I experienced in purchasing this book, I stopped buying books from Amazon anymore."
4,An Inspirational Pararescue,"The book really gave me an idea of the training and gratification that goes along with military rescue forces. Perhaps if you are not very interested in military, you will not find the same respect as I did for ""Pararescue."" If you are a military buff, read it!! I've been on the phones with the 106th talking about a flight slot!"
2,"Great story, poorly written","Pararescue has all the elements of a great true-life rescue adventure: Painstaking research reveals a story of real heros working in impossible conditons against an implaccable natural foe, who face overwhelming odds in attempting to rescue merchant seamen in peril.Unfortunately, the account is written in a droning first-person narrative that is a chore to read. What could have been a bestseller reads more like the voice-over script for a television documentary.Only the fact that the true story is itself gripping enabled me to slog through the clumsy writing to experience this tale of bravery and heroism."
3,The Perfect Story,"If the story of PJs have captured your interest, this is the perfect book to read after reading/watching ""The Perfect Storm"". Unlike Jack Brehm's autobio ""That Others May Live"" which was a difficult read as it was slow and a tad boring, ""Pararescue"" presents the rescue operation in it's entirety, not just from the perspective of one person. The planing, skill and efforts are all brought to life in a well written book. I would love to see a factual book written about PJs on a Special Operations mission along with Delta Forces or Rangers."
3,Real Black MEtal,"First off, I take back what I wrote about another Gorgoroth cd. This really is not that bad. The vocals are the great Black MEtal growls, drums crashing and chugging, and the guitars great as always. I only had a problem with two things on this cd. On the first two songs the drumming just sounds like a train zooming down a track, it sounds unatural and fake. Secondly, on one track there is this weird opera guy singing, just weirded me out. Great cd, don't listen to me, just buy it."
5,"This is a modern ""Romeo and Juliet"" story.","""Endless Love"" is a fine adaptation of Scott Spencer's novel of sexual discovery. The casting of young Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt is excellent, as well as the outstanding supporting cast. Also, I thought the setting and the background music are fine additions to the movie."
1,"You can keep my money, but can I have my 2 hours back?","If the love of your life was just kidnapped and tortured to death, your dog had just been run over and killed, and your doctor just told you that you have both AIDS and Ebola, this might be a good time to see this movie. Even with all your bad news, you could still feel good that you were not the producer or director of this movie. This movie is a triple threat: bad script, bad acting, and bad directing. Even having Tom Cruise doesn't save this flick. I wish Amazon's rating system allowed me to add negative stars rather than just give it one."
4,Endless beauty in this film,"This is such a great film. Great to own. Captures the passion, sexiness, heartbreak and devastation of first love. It's a bit extreme in how far one man will go for the woman he loves but it makes for a grand story. The book is amazing but watching the characters come to life is great too. No one but Brooke Shields could capture Jade so well and the actor who plays her boyfriend is perfect in the role and makes you really feel his pain. The 80s music is wonderful too and adds to the story. Definitely worth owning. Love the ending because it lets you decide what happens next in their story instead of making it a perfect Hollywood ending. If you get the chance, read the book with the same exact title, by Scott Spencer. There is more detail and more sadness but the same beauty of love is captured."
3,Endless Love...........Endless sex you mean!,"I don't know why a lot of people like this film, in my opinion it is nothing but a film about two teenagers having sex, nonstop, that's all there is in this movie. It's nothing but compulsive obsession, not bittersweet romance between two teenagers. Please, this film does not have the kind of Endless love I was hoping for. Nothing but a raging hormoned guy and girl hoping in and out of each others beds and sneaking in at night {and day} to get some nooky. This was not what I was expecting at all. This isn't Endless Love, it's endless crap. P.S. Sorry to be so negative but I just don't see the appeal and/or feel and/or see the supposedly Endless Love happening here. All this guy is feeling is a deep rooted obsession with this girl not love, in my opinion all he misses is the you know what in this twisted relationship."
1,dvd that don't work in any dvd player or computer,This dvd would not work- When I tried to play it(I tried in 2 different dvd players and a computer) and the screen would say:copied dvd not licensed to play(or something like that). After the fact I realized it said:NON-USA FORMART(?) . I would never order an video from this company again. And I hate having to go through the return process too-such an inconvenience.
4,"Good, Soft Music","I love this CD. The ballads are beautiful, and the KISS song is even great! The only downfall is the instrumental with lines from the movie being spoken.... to sappy."
4,A classic love story!,Wonderfully acted by a young Brooke Shields! The male lead was great too and of course the classic song with the same title!
3,Needs a Region 1 release,"As a big eighties teen flick fanatic, Endless Love is one of the movies that I'v always wanted to see but never got around to. The film about love that leads to obession is great and the cast is amazing in their roles. Extra points go to Brooke Shields for taking her shirt off and James Spader for playing his role so well. Look for cameo from a early Ian Ziering (90210 fame) and Tom Cruise."
2,Okay!,I was about 16 years old when this movie was in the movie theaters and being a fan of Brooke Shields I watched Endless Love and I actually liked it but unfortunately I let some people convince me that it wasn't a good movie to like but now that I'm older I find that I like this movie again and think it was good so I'm editing an older review that I wrote in which I gave it a low rating of two stars but I now would rate it 3 1/2 stars.
1,video what video?,how can i review the movie Endless love when i cant seem to get help to buy it!! how do you buy this movie???HELP!!!if you cant buy it now WHEN????
2,The Arrangement,I felt that the movie was low budget and did not have a realistic plot. The movie did not keep my attention and I did not watch the whole thing. It was a waste of money.
1,Contamination of any sound intellect......,"This movie is about some guy who has a one night stand. He owns up his betrayal, to his then, supposed to be future wife. In his guilt he tells her that maybe she should date other people, not thinking that she would actually have the nerve to do it. Boy was he wrong. I'll admit that after I started to become aware of what type of movie this was and how much it stunk, I ""flipped"" through the chapters. This movie showcases infidelity and sexually immoral behavior. This movie should not only be offensive to just African Americans, but to anyone who has a thread of descency or family values."
1,misrepresented usefulness,"Book was advertised to help with any type of writing. It is not. It is only useful for improving the writing of articles, ie. newspaper, mag. etc."
3,The Slipper and the Rose,"The first time I watched this movie was when I was in grade school. It was a class project, and it was shown on a big screen ! Magical ! I always liked musicals and this one stayed on my mind. Now, twenty years later, I can still recall the scenery, the songs, the costumes, etc. Watch it with the whole family. Wish I can see it again. :-)"
1,none,a little confused as it came from bazil and is in portuguse not english love the movie but wondering how it happeneed and would like to exchange to atleat one i can understand.
1,Wimperella....,"I normally don't take the time out for a review, but I am now.I probably own at least a dozen different Cinderella movies, and this has to be one of the weakest.Cinderella herself is a total weakling. She is entirely passive. Everything happens to her - she really doesn't take an active roll. She lets her stepmother take everything away from her. She lets herself be bossed by the stepsisters. She lets herself be talked out of marrying the prince. This Cinderella NEVER stands up for herself.The music drags and is often inappropriate. There's a whole song and dance number in a mausoleum - the prince and his man at arms dance around the crypts of dead kings.The only good point in this is Richard Chamberlain. The one star is for him.Save your money - buy A Tale of Cinderella or Ever After instead - better music, and the Cinderella characters don't just let themselves get pushed around."
1,the slipper and the rose the most boring version with dumb songs,"i had been wanting to see this movie for like forever because of everyone's opinion of it. i finally saw it on megavideo and I'd have to say this is the worst version I've ever seen. Sure the costumes are beautiful and Richard Chamberlain makes for a very handsome prince. But the story reeks with boredom,the characters are unimpressive especially Cinderella herself even though she does have a beautiful voice. And the songs! oh my god! they suck! they are not catchy or entertaining! What could have been a 5 star epic tale went terribly wrong and turned out to be a big snooze fest! I would not recommend this to anyone. What I would recommend however is the Disney animated version and all 3 versions of Rogers and Hammerstein instead. Better story! Better songs!"
2,Very disappointing.,"After winning an autographed copy several years ago, I had to wait a long time to unite this DVD with a DVD player. I have always enjoyed the Sherman Brothers' work, from Mary Poppins to 1776, even the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room. I was also looking forward to finally watching Michael Hordern onscreen, after falling in love with his voice in the BBC's radio version of The Lord of the Rings (he was a spectacular Gandalf). Now, after all that buildup, what a tremendous letdown. I'm about 40 minutes in and bored out of my skull. The jokes are flat, the lyrics monosyllabic and predictable, the melodies are entirely forgettable, and the acting is entirely two-dimensional.Not recommended for anyone over the age of 5."
4,My Daughters' Favorite,"This came out when my daughters were 10 and 12 and they thoroughly loved it. The music is first rate and the story is classic, obviously. I found myself watching it with them and still find myself humming the tunes 22 years later. Six months ago I tried to find it in video and was disappointed that it wasn't available. I recommend it to anyone with small children, an ear for music, and an appreciation of classic fairy tales."
4,My search is over,I've been hoping to see this movie released for years. This is the movie I went to see at the movie theater instead of Star Wars. I made a good choice. The music is great and the characters are what makes this movie a must have. I don't know how they managed to make a movie this funny and romantic too.
5,Happy days are here again:),"I first saw this movie as a teenager and have loved it ever since. I too, had a very poor copy taped off T.V. that was almost worn out. The songs are wonderful (who can forget ""A bride-finding ball""?) and the scenery is beautiful. I wish that I could give more than 5 stars for this wonderful movie."
2,Not The Best DVD version out there!,Price wise....ya its cheaper than the 2000 issueBUT!this one is only Full Screen 1:33and127 min run timethe 2000 issue is now up to $25.00 +but is Wide Screen 2:35and143 min run timeyes their really are reasons to know what movie versions are out there to know what one really is the best to buy!this one isn't it!
3,Which version?,"The fully restored version (based on the British release) that was released in 2000 on DVD ran 143 minutes and had some great extras including one of the better commentaries I've ever heard. This DVD is listed as much shorter in run time and the description doesn't mention extras. I really enjoyed the restored version, the songs ran longer and some plot points made more sense. I'd love to order this for gifts since the other is out of print but I don't want to give the edited American version especially if it doesn't include that commentary."
4,Worth your time,I watched this movie when it first came out thirty years ago. The music is wonderful. Just what you would expect. The take on the story is a little different but not so different as to disappoint diehard Cinderella fans. There is more of a back story to the Prince and a new dilemma keeping him and Cinderella apart. The stepmother and stepsisters are divine. They nailed the parts. The fairy godmother is a riot and probably my favorite character in this movie. The incidental love story of the prince's companion-at-arms and a lady-in-waiting is very charming. I have always loved fairy tales and I was not disappointed in the retelling of one of the world's favorites.
5,this is the best film ever,this film uis the bvest film i have ever seen the music is so fun and the story is great and so magical. I love the cindrella story and i feel thatthis film expands the story in a very successful way. My favorite part of the film is where edward finds cinderella on his horse. It is so romantic i didnt realise until now that you could get it on dvd but i will be ordering it straight away.
3,Beautiful but poor quality DVD,I was so happy to find my favourite version of Cinderella. I loved this movie as a child and was continually pestering my mother to rent it on video. I must have seen it 25-30 times! However I was really disappointed in the quality of this DVD. The sound doesn't match the Actors mouths......it was only slightly off to begin with so I was able to ignore it. But it kept getting worse. I recommend getting the video version instead. Its still one of the most beautiful movies I have seen....as long as I don't focus on the actors mouths!
3,Mediocre,"I've seen and I own a lot of Cinderellas. Some are pretty obscure (Sophia Loren and Omar Shariff in More than a Miracle.)The best I can say about this is that it's mediocre. The music is pretty forgettable, despite the Oscar win. I actually remember watching the Oscars that night being at a lost as to why this film won.The costumes are beautiful, the acting so-so. But on a whole it is bloated and overhyped.Even the Leslie Ann Warren Disney TV version is better.Unless you are a rabid Richard Chamberlain fan, pass this up. Do you really want to see Chamberlain embarrass himself by singing and dancing?"
3,Reading the Other Reviews was a Pleasant Surprise...,"because when this movie premiered in NYC years ago, it was panned pretty badly. Like one of the other reviewers, I too was in the Radio City Music Hall audience, as one of my cousins had gotten free tickets to see it. I know I saw it at least once on TV, on the late late show. Unlike the other members of my family, I thought ""The Slipper and the Rose"" was a pretty good movie. Richard Chamberlain was very appealing as the Prince, and the songs are quite memorable and tuneful.While I couldn't say it's the best movie musical I've ever seen, I nonetheless would recommend ""The Slipper and the Rose"" as a nice piece of entertainment."
3,charming and delightful but..,"I first saw this movie as a child and it has always been my favorite telling of Cinderella. The costumes alone are worth seeing. Every aspect of filming is exquisite. Gemma Craven is perfectly cast as Cinderella. She lets the stepmother know she hates her. Annette Crosby as the godmother is wonderful. She injects a great sense of humor into the movie as a godmother who complains about being overworked. Margaret Lockwood is a delightful wicked stepmother. It surprised me that Richard Chamberlin is such a good vocalist, but he is worth seeing and hearing.My major complaint is that the songs are long which may be hard for younger viewers. It sometimes can tax older viewers as well."
5,A wonderful version of a classic; more people should watch it,"The ""Slipper and the Rose"" is a wonderful version of the Cinderella story and it is a shame that more people haven't seen it. It is a musical, so people who don't like musicals should avoid it, but it also has quite a few twists on the original story that I find charming. Additionally, although it is an older film starring actors who were once box office regulars but are no longer, I (who am around 30 years old) still found it lovely. The only thing I would want to improve is to have the film on Blu-Ray instead of regular DVD."
3,My take on the Slipper and the Rose DVD,"I was not happy with this DVD. Perhaps it's my 46in Samsung HDTV, but it appears to be a full screen version. I also own the full screen version of this DVD, and I can't see any difference between the two versions. They are both the same length in time and both have the same granular appearance on the screen."
4,a little too slow paced,"If you like musical, you'll like this movie. For me this movie is a little too slow paced. I do like the drama part though. My five-yr-old daughter and four-yr-old son like the story too. I first watched this movie when it just came out at the theatre. I was too young to undertsand and slept through most part of the movie. Watching it again was fun. Wish someone will remake the Cinderella story with real people."
3,Prince Charming,"This is a charming,if not slightly affected version of the Cinderella story.As a long time Richard Chamberlain fan, I suppose I would say that the Prince is a role he was destined to play. I've know for years that he has a decent singing voice,and this film supports that.Gemma Craven is a delightful Cinderella,and Annette Crosbie is one of the best Fairy Godmothers ever.Many of the supporting cast are Masterpiece theatre veterans, and everyone performs admirably. ""slipper and the Rose"" is a sweet,entertaining film!"
5,"""Suddenly it happens, and the dream comes true!""","""Wonderfully, beautifully it happens and your world is new,"" says Cinderella in this long awaited film, which is FINALLY being released in its entirety -- the full length, British version! This wonderful, lavish musical of the story of Cinderella, stars Richard Chamberlain as the Prince, Gemma Craven as Cinderella, and a wonderful cast including Annette Crosbie, Michael Hordern, Christopher Gable, Kenneth More, Margaret Lockwood, and Dame Edith Evans. The musical score is brilliantly written by the incomparable Sherman Brothers, who also co-wrote the script with Director Bryan Forbes. This is a great film for all ages, and sure to be a perfect addition to your movie collection."
4,This Is A Good Movie That Is Based On The Cinderella Fairytale!,I first watched The Slipper and The Rose on TV and I liked it and thought this musical Cinderella that stars Genna Craven and Richard Chamberlain was really quite entertaining and I highly recommend it and I have to agree with the reviewers who say to buy it on DVD instead of on video! One reviewer had said to buy the video tape instead of the DVD and I'm not trying to sound mean and that I'm slamming that reviewer but I think recommending the video tape instead of the DVD is bad advice since they say that VHS tapes are going to be obslolete and go the way of Beta tapes and 8 track tapes.
5,One of the Best,"As a child the Slipper and the Rose was always on at Christmas on television in the UK. I used to love watching it.I have now moved to New Zealand and they haven't heard of it! I have been hunting for the film for ages, and someone got me in touch with Amazon. Within a week of ordering it, it arrived and I have already watched it twice.A wonderful movie that will go on and on. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good pick me up and oh Richard Chamberlain is yummy in it!"
4,Witty Richard Chamberlain Musical,"I will preface this by saying that it's not my cup of tea, since it's an old showtune-y musical piece, but I got this for my girlfriend, & she totally adores it. If you like witty, goofy Richard Chamberlain musicals, this will fit nicely into your DVD collection. I did find myself laughing @ the sheer absurdity of the lyrics and dance numbers."
2,Caution with this supplier,"this product is ok however, unlike the discription claims it is not easy to cut, even with new sharp tools, the seets that I recieved tend to be very hard almost like Lenoleum tile for your floor, but even harder serface then even those. Either the product some where got exposed to extreame heat or its old."
1,A Collection of Intros,"I hate to say this, but the cover art is the best part, by far, of this CD. I own EVERYTHING Mannheim Steamroller has ever produced, and I know what to expect from Chip Davis' eclectic arrangements. That being said, I was very underwhelmed by this offering. What it seems to be is a collection of intros that end before getting to the ""meat"" of the songs.If you are looking for something that will leave you whistling familiar Disney tunes, this isn't it."
4,Best in a while,"I just received and listened to this selection. I totally disagree with sboloch's review. This person is obviously not familiar with Mannheim Steamroller's/Chip Davis' work, which is to build their own sound AROUND a familiar tune, to add and tweak it, as well as create their own original music. I had no problem finding traces or whole sections of the Disney music, which was totally acceptable within this structure, with the exception of HAKUNA MATATA. Nothing except the words was kept from that piece but perhaps the words were the only thing they were after. I usually purchase the Xmas CD's but thoroughly enjoyed this one. As a person who watched the original Mickey Mouse Club, I found the last selection to be positively haunting, akin to my favorite Mannheim Steamroller piece, SILENT NIGHT. If we all wanted to hear the original tunes as produced by Disney, Disney makes their own CD's. Kudos to Chip Davis!"
4,"Better than the RA samples make it seem, but room to improve","Having heard the samples online, I was a little concerned, but I really enjoy the album. I find it quite ""sleepy"", not exactly the typical excitement found in many Mannheim Steamroller stuff. I hope that in future albums, the variations follow the emotion of the original. Under the Sea, for example, in the movie is the show-stopping big production number, but on this album, it's really quite slow and peaceful. The album is a must for a Disney music collector like myself, and definitely something to look at for those who like Mannheim Steamroller."
4,"Good, but no sing-along!","""Mannheim Steamroller meets the Mouse"": Since you're already a Disney fan, if you're also a MS fan, you will love this album. Hits from ""When You Wish upon a Star"" to Mulan's ""Reflection"" in the typical driving chamber-type music style made popular by the group. However, don't expect to plop down with your family next to your stereo to listen to your kids sing along with the album's tunes. It ain't gonna happen. As is typical with most Steamroller adaptations, many liberties are taken with the original tunes. In fact, the original tune in Hakuna Matata can't be found anywhere in this album's version. Includes a nice rendition of the MM March, but for those of us who remember the old show, be prepared for melancholy, almost eerie goosebumps when you hear Jimmie Dodd's voice at the end of the tune."
5,This is my favorite album of this year,"I admit, this is my first Mannheim Steamroller CD, but I am a Disney nut, and buy all there stuff...anyway, now I am a Steamroller fan and looking for more of these CDs. If you like Disney, or Mannheim, BUT THIS...it is EXCELLENT."
1,"All show, no go.","The key word in the title is ""unique."" I'll give it that. I'm sure the contents pass muster as ""art,"" and in that regard, I know what I like; this ain't it. Most of these tracks take forever to go anywhere and sound like Chip Davis & Co. have just discovered synthesizers and looping software. The only really listenable track is ""Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah"", which establishes fairly quickly and at least sounds like the song it's supposed to be. Even it, along with most of the others, is a study in ""Hey, Mom, watch this!"" sound effects generation unworthy of either the Disney moniker or Mannheim Steamroller. ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" tangled up with ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"" - with neither really coming to the fore - borders on insulting; Jiminy Cricket would not be happy! Unless you're a fan of early Moog experiments, pass on this one."
4,It's fun,"This is a fun album, especially if you're a big Disney fan, or have kids who are. Chip Davis does a good job with the arranging, and it has the Mannheim sound that we all love. BUT, I have to say that this is not their best album. I like it, but I don't love it."
3,Pretty good. A little weird.,Very interesting. Not your typical Disney album. Worth a look at though
3,Worth having more tracks on this CD.,"I also thought that this CD could have had more songs on it. But, the tracks that are listed are definitely worth an ear to."
2,"Interesting, but not Disney and not even 50 minutes of music","If you like Mannheim Steamroller and you like Disney music, this is an good ensemble. I was not disappointed with the music, but I was disappointed with the total length of the recordings. I expect to buy newly recorded CDs with at least 60 minutes worth of music."
2,Not as good as I expected,It all sounds the same! Maybe that's because a lot of disney songs have the same theme running through them? Definitely not the best Mannheim.
4,Enjoyable.,"Easy listening. Enjoyable. However, unless you have the Table of Contents you aren't always able to tell what the song is. When you are a ""Mouse"" connoisseur it's annoying."
4,"Four and a half stars, if I had my choice","Drink With the Devil makes for an absolutely fantastic read. Sean Dillon, arguably the (or one of) most loved characters ever created by Higgins, returns again in this thriller. Yes, the story may be a tad slow at times, but it never promised to be a high adrenaline-pumped book in the first place. And that was why it was such a pleasant read. The mood of the book changes from time to time, scene to scene, and appropriately so. Higgins' writing may not be the most fanciful, but boy, was it a great ride. Not to be missed, especially if you're a great fan of Jack Higgins, and of Sean Dillon as well."
2,LESS OF THE SAME,"Higgins doesn't break a sweat with this one. If you have read Higgins' other books with Sean Dillon as the protagonist there's is no need to read this one. Same story elements, same set piece action scenes and so on. Maybe I have read one too many of his books but they are all very much blending together now. Even the name of the book is unoriginal, note his earlier ""Touch the Devil."" Harmless enough few hours of reading but not much is new."
4,NOT THE BEST BUT IT'S CLOSE,"The first book by Jack Higgins that I read, since then I have read many more. While this book is slow at times it's not slow for long, I enjoyed it from cover to cover. Thank You Mr. Higgins for showing me the joy of reading."
5,These Guys Deliver Quality RocknRoll,"I am a Djay for a comeback radio show. It's always hit & miss checking out all the comebacks of older bands. This one was a big positive surprise. I like their sound now better than in the 60's, with the exception of the masterpiece""The Letter."" The first 4 tracks of this album are super. Wang Dang Doodle is a great blues song that I liked by Koko Taylor and the Box Tops do a terrific version of it here. As I was listening to the album and enjoying it all I thought that the only thing I hoped they'd do is put a more hard rockin jam song in tthe mix, and then they gave me just that with the last track of 6 minutes called Big Bird. I play this album quite a lot and have played 9 of the tracks on my radio show. I've gotten very good feedback about the songs. The Box Tops are still touring and one more album would be nice. This is a great addition to their catalog of great music."
5,This CD Rips,"The Box Tops new CD, and may I say first release in many too many years, recaptures those same good time feelings that seemed to permeate the late 60s. The music, mostly covers, is exceptionally well executed and Alex sounds more focused than he has in years. If you were the Box Tops fan that I was ( if you're over 45 years old how could you not be )you owe it to yourself to get a copy of this new recording."
1,Do not expect this CD to rekindle your love of The Box Tops.,"This CD does not come close to recapturing the spirit of The Box Tops in the 60's. Of the 14 songs on this CD, only two are worth listening to. Alex Chilton has lost the distinct tones that were prevelent in his voice in his youth. As you can tell, I was highly disappointed in this CD."
3,Cute movie...under-rated!,"This is a really cute movie! After reading the negative reviews, I almost didn't watch it. I'm glad I did! The two lead characters are adorable, especially Carlos J. Da Silva, as the internet hook-up gay guy finding himself in NYC. His acting was natural and really good - his roommate, while a weaker actor, is still an adorable and likeable character and the story line is one most gay men can relate to. There is plenty of eye candy with many cute boys and simulated sex scenes...however, it really is a story with a heart, and a realistic portrayal of contemporary gay life. Yes, it is a low budget movie but, all things considered, a suprisingly good movie! A very pleasant way to spend an hour or two!"
4,breaking cycle,pretty good story line and having the characters thoughts known to us helps make the plot believable. The guys are hot too and it is cool how they finally hook up.
2,Meeting your roommate on Internet Dating Site,Meeting your roommate on Internet Dating Site and fall in love without knowing the guy on the other end of the chat is your roommate. Predictable.
3,"Bad film, great bodies",This is not a good film but the actors are fairly hot. I would recommend it only if you're needing some man-candy.
5,viva la farberware 1-quart saucepan with lid,"this saucepan is an absolute delight. everytime i see it or use it it makes me feel good (my life is a simple one. obviously). its aesthetically pleasing, user friendly, and cooks and cleans up handily like the true little workhorse it is. i look forward to many more years of enjoyable saucing in my one quart saucepan with lid and am contemplating adding its big sister (2 quart faberware saucepan) to my repetoir."
5,The best in stainless steelware,"Whenever I burn out a pot or want new ones I look for Farberware stainless steel. However, it is hard to get individual pots, especially smaller ones, in retail stores, so I usually get it from Amazon.com. I'd delighted that these pots are available from Amazon.com as otherwise I wouldn't know where to get them. The product itself is the best in stainless steel quality for cooking, lightweight and easy to use and stainless steel is reported to be the healthiest material to use for cooking."
2,Not real 18/10 steel,"I believe this is not real 18/10 stainless steel it claims to be. It does not have this impressed on the bottom. And the overall quality is poor. I bought this sauce pan on Jan 22, and the handle is not as firmly attached anymore as it used to be. Sad. For 25 bucks that is not acceptable."
3,Do not pour hot liquids,"My wife and I just bought this Saucepan a few weeks ago. On the positive side, it is well made with nice materials and seems to be very durable. On the other side, when the water is boiling and you pour the water to a cup (for example) the water in contact with the wall of the pan start to evaporate and sprinkles VERY HOT WATER. Saucepans with Teflon cover inside do not do this. I think this happens with all Saucepan with bare metal finish inside. We should not bought this pan.Bottom line if you do not pour hot liquids, you might like this Sauce Pan"
4,great movie,"I live In Rutherford County and my husband worked for Damon Huskey on which the movie is based. Some of the things were a little far fetched but all in all is depicted as he lived.The Part of the movie of the 3 officers that were killed was based on actual events as it took place on that horrible evening May 31st 1979.My husband was working that day and spend hours in the woods looking for the shooter.So far this movie has only been available on VHS and would love to see it on DVD.But it is worth watching to see how a country sheriff did all that was expected of him and then some.Kind of like Buford Pusser in ""Walking tall"" but he didn't carry a big stick just a big gun."
4,Classic intro to SUSY,"This book is the classic introduction to superfields. It is very elegant an formal, and appeals to the more mathematically minded particle physics student. It contains almost nothing on phenomenological applications of supersymmetry, and keeps it's hands clean by avoiding messy but important topics, such as regularization of supersymmetric gauge theories."
4,Charming and Entertaining,"""Sweet Shrub"" was such a surprise. This book looked like dripy ole' southern novel. BUT...how wrong I was. This book was deep, emotional and I loved the characters. DEEPLY. This is such a great book.....it's clear, enjoyable, and such a pleasant surprise."
4,Excellent and Inspiring,"Although it was written a couple of years ago, it is just as inspiring for current business owners as years ago. It is excellent and just proves again the Power of God if we would just be obedient and faithful. Thank you very much Mr. Tam, your experience and obedience inspired me to be more God-centered in my business."
5,Life changing book...,"This book was given as a gift to me when I visited a small business for a market analysis project. It was the first time someone had presented the idea that a person can have a successful career not at the expense of pleasing God. While few would be called to Tam's same ministry, many people can be changed by the message in this book."
1,did not fit with phone type specified,This cord was advertised as fitting an LG2000 phone which it did not.
5,Wonderful,Basil Johnson is a master story teller and writer. The legends are all deeply meaningful. He really transmits the spirit of the Anishinaubae in a vivid way. I hope he writes down a lot more of these haunting legends and that his hopes for the recovery of the Anishinaubae language and cultural traditions come to full realization.
3,Talent? Yes. Boring? Without a doubt.,"I was really anxious to give Amel a spin. I was really only familiar with her sound with Groove Theory, but have been meaning to pick up her solo work for the last couple of years. Maybe I picked the wrong album with ""Morning"" to get to know Amel as a solo artist, but yawn! Her voice is amazing, but the lyrics and the accompanying music were slumber inducing. Maybe that isn't a terrible thing, but other than passively listening to this album very occasionally as background music, I'm not sure how much of a future ""Morning"" has on my speakers. Great to read a book to, or fall asleep to, but for active listening, this just wasn't my personal cup of tea. Give this a listen before clicking ""add"". Or, better yet, if you are looking for great vocals mixed with hazy, sensual downtempo,check out Aya's ""Strange Flower"" instead of, or even in addition to this. This is good, well sort of, but won't see a lot of foot traffic in my house."
3,Amel....,"Okay the cd to me is aiight. Nothing to brag about I'velistened to it several times and was pulled in by waery,but im still looking for my girl Amel who did Infinite Possibilities other wise No One Else and Gills and Tails it has the same flow of Bravebird just minus the Kwame. Its not bad but not that good either."
2,"Good Vocalist,but sleepy time music","Amel Larrieux is a Really Good Vocalist&has a nice tune,but this album makes me real Sleepy Time. the Production&arrangements don't challenge or match the vocals that she presents. Amel should be having a Alicia Keys type of Career run now as to being stuck with tired formulated tracks by the numbers."
3,The Cee-Lo CD,"I call this the Cee-Lo CD beacause tracks 4,5, and 6 are tight (or is it tracks 5,6,7?), well anyway, they are sandwiched between what I consider pretty mediocre songs, don't get me wrong I love Amel but I prefer the ""Grove Theory"" & ""Infinite Possibilities"" periods(excellent work). But she brings diversity to the ""game"", I respect that."
2,Bloody Awful,"I remember back when my pockets were hurting, I purchased Bravebird because like Nia Long in Love Jones needing an Isley Brother's CD...I needed to hear new material from Amel...Infinite Possibilities helped me through some difficult times. But unfortunately, more than my pockets were hurting. But, I decided to continue my support. I purchased Morning and found it is not what you would expect from Amel. I agree with the review below....The Neo-soul genre is experiencing some kind of drought. And when your favorite artists come with something new, you are excited and expecting to play it 24/7 like when Lauryn Hill came out with Miseducation......The first cut ""Trouble"" sounds like a song made for my infant daughter. I had to blast my radio for ""no one else"" because I couldn't understand what she was saying.However, I will continue to support Amel and hope the next project will Wow me!"
4,She continues to blow me away,"I wish she could sign with Motown or J Records and get some of the respect she deserves. While Britney and J. Lo are making headlines, she is making music. That effortless coloratura, she does everything but the Riperton-esque notes (and Trouble was close :-) ). Maybe a hook-up with Quincy Jones or Stevie Wonder could have her become a SHINING STAR..."
3,"Not enough here, though still better than her last album","Talented as Larrieux may be, with the freedom of indie control comes the responsibility to hone your offering to the best songs each time out. This record gives us a couple of strong songs and a lot of filler, which is saying a lot on a record that only has 10 tracks on it. If you release a 10-track album these days, it better be slamming (say, like Julie Dexter's records).Notable tracks are ""Unanswered Questions"" and ""Gills and Tails"", which should be on the radio doing what her music does when it gets there: changing thangs instead of being changed by thangs."
3,Morning,"As a fan of Amel Larrieux since her Groove Theory days, I always look forward to her releases. I've had MORNING for a while but still only truly like 5 of the 10 offerings which isn't that unusual given the fact that over time songs from her last cd, BRAVEBIRD grew on me. I'm not disappointed because I love her voice and the courage & energy it must take to continue to put her music out there despite the rigidity of today's music business.My favorite tracks are: WEARY - a terrific, well written song that was an excellent lead single; NO ONE ELSE - a beautifully spare love song, her voice sounds so pretty on this track; TROUBLE - fun song; UNANSWERED QUESTION - beautiful lyrics & production and GILLS & FRILLS - again, beautifully produced track.Fans will appreciate the new music but to those who are just discovering this artist, I'd recommend getting her debut disc prior to purchasing this one since the sound & overall vibes of the albums are so different."
4,A LOT OF GOOD MORNINGS WITH MORNING,"I hate the way record companies use the cookie-cutter approach to backing/promoting artists, i.e. if it worked for one artist then the rest must sound really similar. Amel Larrieux has been a breath of fresh air to me and she has been criminally underrated. This cd has not altered my opinion one bit. The imagery of ""Gills and Tails"" was literally 'breath-taking'. ""Weary"" should be my own personal anthem because it was like Amel was walking around in my brain. Her work sometimes seems to be a throw-back to another time and at other times it seems futuristic. I heard ""Bravebird"" one day and was intrigued by this woman. I went and found her previous cd ""Infinite Possibilities"" and anxiously awaited the release of ""Morning"". I have yet to be disappointed. If you're solely interested in top-forty music, Amel is not for you. However, if you're looking for music that moves, is familiar and foreign at the same time, give Ms. Larrieux a listen. No cookie-cutter here!"
1,Disappointed :(,"Received CD on time but when i put it into my computer, it does not play nor can copy to my iTunes library. There's a major scratch on the disk that i'm guessing is the problem..."
3,oooo trouble!,"one of my favorite amel larrieux projects. a friend brought it over on a trip from philly and from the first track ""trouble"", i was riveted. that groove in particular is smokin and the hook is ridiculous, i just wish it was longer. following that everything is a smooth, jazzy and polished collection of larrieux-ish songs. a pretty consistent record and she should be proud of her accomplishment."
2,Mostly Siamese If You Please,"If you have a Siamese cat, this might be interesting, but only one chapter applies to the title claim of ""how to talk to your cat,"" and I suspect Siamese must speak a different language than other cats. This was written in 1978 and sounds old-fashioned in the style of writing."
4,fifteen years ago...,"A friend of mine had a copy of this, back when floppy disks were big... I remember it stuck very close to the books; well, the first three at least...I found a place on the 'net where you can play the game, but I've forgotten how you keep from getting killed by the brick in the first scene!Sean"
4,"He wrote some great stuff that wasn't Hitchhiker, too","He really got his non-Hitchhiker groove on here and wrote a thoroughly enjoyable, imaginative, and thought-provoking novel that will have you turning pages from start to finish. You don't even have to read the first Dirk Gently first if you don't want to. Just go grab this, dive in, and enjoy. I gave more words to the first one, but this one's better."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Still odd, this private investigator.This is much of a muchness with the last book, but the act wears thing after having it done the first time around. Dirk still has dodgy fridge hygiene. The plot if you want to call it that this time has to do with a possible deity, some blowing up of stuff including people, and an annoying album also features."
3,...Not the same as Holistic Detective Agency,"This book is also definitely WAY OUT THERE. But I have to say, I did not find it quite as laugh-out-loud funny as its prequel, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. I am almost finished with it (less than 50 pages to go and those will go quick), but it is VERY ODD! Still, it has many of the same classic Adams' techniques and it still quite funny."
3,The ideas just weren't clicking,"I'm sure that the fact that it took me over a month to read is part of the problem, but the title seemed more related to my experience of reading the book than the content of the storyline. I mean, I don't think I laughed once through the last half of the book. The ideas just weren't clicking, and even his characters were depressed. I don't think DNA enjoyed writing this one. Or, at least, the last half. The first half was great. I laughed until I cried, that sort of thing. He was so creative and amazingly funny, and I really want to try to practice personifications like he could do. But the last half I didn't like so much."
4,"If you liked Hitch Hiker's Guide, you'll like this","Douglas Adams, in my opinion, is really funny. He writes jokes that you have to be pretty smart to get, but not a genius. British jokes. But jokes, nonetheless. He writes strange, off-the-wall, science fiction humor. Sometimes the book can get a little too strange and make you go, ""what?"" and reread that page, but its still good. I liked it, and I hope you'll like it too."
4,"Great book, but not as good as the first","I came away from this book with the feeling that it was a bit of a comedown after the first Dirk Gently book. It didn't quite deliver the same laugh-out-loud hilarity and intelligent, complex plot as the first one.Having said that, though, you still can't go very wrong by buying this book. I love all of Douglas Adams' works (yes, even the oft-maligned ""Mostly Harmless""), so for me a four-star review just means that it wasn't quite as enjoyable as many of his other books. But it's still a good read, no question about it."
4,I believed every word of it.,"I read this book about 10 years ago and all my friends who were technical writers liked it. We practiced moving our heads ever so slightly to try and slip between the molecules. Well, we were much younger then and lunch hours were much longer."
4,For the fans (pt. 2),"In this book we follow Dirk Gently on another crazy adventure. This is the second book in the series, the first beingDirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. I'd recommend to read the books in the correct order (I think the character introduction of Dirk Gently is better in the first book). Also, the story here seems to me to be a bit more complex than the first one.If it's your first book from this author, don't take this one. Then the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy is the one you want (witch is also a series consisting of 5 books). If, after reading that, you've become a fan, then the Dirk Gently-series is definitely for you!"
5,Fascinating,"I just wanted to add (to all of the other reviews) that, while the Dirk Gently books may not be as hilarious as the Hitchhiker's book (and at times verge toward drama), I would say they are much more interesting. The plots are complicated to be sure, at times esoteric and puzzling, and you may even have to re-read, but I find it is well worth it. Fascinating."
3,The Ending Just Fizzles,"I truly enjoyed reading Douglas Adams' ""The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul."" That is, right until I finished it. Up to that point, I had been prepared to give it at least a 4 star rating. But, the ending just fizzles. Perhaps it does more than fizzle. It just disappears. Instead of an ending that would tie everything up nicely and cleverly like everything else in the book, Adams ends the book at the last minute by, basically, throwing up his hands and quitting. All he needed was a couple more pages where he could have dumped the ""Hot Potato"" into the lap of the responsible parties and all would have been well. Instead, he just... stops. The ending reminds me of how badly he destroyed the Hitchhiker series with the miserableMostly Harmless. I'm so angry with the ending that I'd like to rate the book at 1 star. But, rationally, I really enjoyed 99.9% of the book. So, I'm splitting the difference and rating it at an OK 3 stars out of 5."
1,Brilliant reading ruined by bad mastering,"Douglas Adams' reading of The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul is truly engaging. The problem with this audio book is two-fold:1. None of the tracks has any text-encoding. This means that devices that read this information cannot use or display the CD names or track names. So, an iTunes won't read any CD or track names. Nor will any CD player that can show track names.2. CD #6 of the set repeats the same scene over and over, without ever reaching the ending.New Millenium Audio destroyed a perfectly enjoyable performance with its poor mastering of the CD."
1,Warning - missleading title,"Even this CD is called ""New year's concert 2000 in Vienna"" it is NOT the popular ""New year's concert"" which can be seen all over the world. The real thing is the ""Vienna Philharmonic: New year's concert 2000"" under Riccardo Muti (conductor).I felt upset getting the wrong CD and had to replace it. This just extended to period of waiting for the pleasure of the real ""Neujahrskonzert""."
2,Bad cheese!!!,"I was looking forward to this for two reasons. One, it had Fangoria's name on it and two, because I enjoy indie horror movies. Plainly put, I can't believe Fangoria is associated with this film. It has nothing compared to the quality of Lady of the Lake, or Slashers. The dubbing is terrible. Now, I know that this was a german movie dubbed into english, but come on! It just doesn't look right. I've seen skin flicks with better dubbing! The script must have been written by a twelve year old. It's bad, even for a horror movie. After awhile, I watched it in fast forward mode and found nothing remotely interesting to put it back in regular play mode. Avoid this at all costs. If you like cheesy horror movies, get Attack of the Killer Refridgerator, or Slashers, but definitely save your money and leave this one on the shelf."
2,Boring,"I had read somewhere that this foreign(german i think) slasher flick was good...so I rented it(thank goodness I did'nt buy it) and was really disapointed. The dubbing is bad and the plot is so unoriginal. Basically a maniac escapes from an aslyum who likes to kill people with big scissors-at the same time, some teenagers decide to party in a spooky old school where they just graduated from. There is alot of running around, people crawling through air vents, and of course stabbings. It isn't even gory if you're into that sorta thing and the beginning, which is like a rip-off of Scream is just plain silly....Skip this one or rent it if you have insomnia..."
4,Informative and helpful,I chose this book because I am a caregiver and it was reccomended to me. I found it informative and helpful.
3,Alzheimer's,This was a good study tool but you really have to watch the actions of your patient and work through some of the things in the book as well as the exercise.
1,you have got to be kidding me,I am absolutely appalled and saddened to see a book with this title.I've been lost in the 'Alzheimer' labyrinth for the past decade.I have no need for a condescending book of this ilk.The title alone makes me want to vomit.Shame on the authors and anyone associated with it.Alzheimer's Disease is too complex a disease for a 'Dummies' manual.This deeply disturbs me.~m
1,Title of this book,"This book may have excellent and easy-to-understand contents about Alzheimer's. However, the title is somewhat belittling and insensitive to the patient and to the family. Yes, having worked with Alzheimer patients and families, I would say so. I would NOT recommend this book to them. Perhaps to the general public is okay......but then, should they not also go to Alzheimer's Association (www.alz.org) and their local chapters throughout the country for general information and resources??"
3,Good but flawed,"The plot and the characters are done well and over all I enjoyed it. However this text desperately needs an English editor. The author repeatedly makes errors regarding the English milieu. The most glaring of which is the appearance of skunks in the English countryside, and a 10d nail is known only in north America in England despite the attempts of the EU nails are referred to by their inch length. Therefore it should have been a 3""nail that had been wrenched free being the equivalent to 10d. Yes I realise this sounds picky but the effect is to stop the flow of the story and jerk the reader back into reality, very jarring and in the end distracting I started to prepare for the next error rather than go along for the ride. so 7/10"
4,First of a great series,"Martha Grimes has some great ( and a couple no so much) stories in this series. Her writing is wonderful, the characters developing over time and interesting plots. Highly recommended."
2,"Hands Free ""Headset"" is really at ""Earset""","This accessory is limited by the microphone dangling near your face. This does not for clear transmission of voice and the complaint of listeners is too much background noise. To make the accessory really work well, you have to cup the microphone in your hand next to your face. In this case, you may as well put the phone next to your face since you are no longer ""hands-free"". It would be better for Ericsson to create an adapter allowing a true headset with directional microphone that would be in front of your mouth. This would minimize background noise."
3,Not the place to start on Scott music,"Raymond Scott was a strong influence on mid-20th century American Music, but this album sounds more influenced than influential. At his best, Raymond Scott used inventive rhythms, ground-breaking instrumentation, and original orchestration to create a body of work that survives today. The frenetic opening theme of The Simpsons show on Fox is vintage Scott, ""Power House"" written in the 1930's.This album was produced in 1960, and is much more in synch with jazz of the day, and even pop music of the day, than his earlier work was. That is a shame. Indeed, Scott employed 'The Secret 7' who were really eight prominent Jazz musicians of the day, to record this album, and they were major talents on the 1960 jazz scene, but none is identified except for Toots Thielemans, on jazz harmonica.In the end, this is not great jazz and is inferior Scott. Scott was so good, that the album is still good music, just not the great music Scott could make at his best."
5,Van Damme best films.,"I have no doubt that this is one of the best Van Damme low budget movies. It have everything you need for a action movies. Amazing stuns, great karate choreography, hard hitting Fx, great story and a lot of heart. And don't forget Van Damme do a great acting in this movie together with an amazing director Ringo Lam.The Blu-ray disc itself is a great collectable transfer of the original movie. The picture look beautiful and very clear. It have a awesome main menu and some great special features like Deleted scenes, storyboards and audio commentary with Van Damme and Michael Rooker. For those who speak other Language it only have Spanish and English Subtitles. That's sad.Above all if you like Van Damme I recommend this movie completely. Have Fun."
4,idgie,"I was pleasantly surprised by this Claude Van Damme movie. Ahead of it's time in terms of genetics research and nature vs nurture. It's theory that although someone may have the identical DNA as another person, their ultimate personality profile is dependent on their own personal experiences...especially those formed from one's childhood. It is now a known research fact, that although identical twins are born with the exact DNA at birth, by the time they are aged...their DNA looks no different than that of typical siblings. Why?...because their differing life experiences have altered their DNA on a cellular level. Both leads give excellent and affecting performances, especially Van Damme's dual performance. Although I did find the violence a bit excessive, I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a unique plot line and the fascinating theory of ""Tabula Rasa"" (nature vs nurture)."
4,One of Van Damme's best,"While Jean-Claude Van Damme may be a direct to video action star now, Replicant is a surprisingly good film that should have seen time in theaters instead of other Van Damme flops like Knock Off and Double Team. The storyline, which has Van Damme doing double duty as a serial killer called The Torch and a clone of the killer, is instantly ignored as we see how surprisingly creepy and effective Van Damme is as the killer, and how naive and innocent he is as the developing clone. Michael Rooker is great as well (he always is though) as the ex-cop on the killer's trail. The action scenes are very well put together, and as I said before, the acting from Van Damme is so unbelieveably good in his dual roles that you might forgive him for films like Street Fighter and The Quest (well, maybe not), but all in all, Replicant is one of Van Damme's best, and it is a shame it has gone direct to video."
5,Funny and great,"Van Damme stars as a serial killer and the replicant version developed by gov-t. Van Damme acts well and is very funny to watch as the Replicant goes around learning everything around him and gets himself in funny situations. THe movie has a very positive feel overall and is very well done on the story front. Action is great and Van Damme shows off his gymnastics skills again. Everything about the movie is great, so I'd recommend it. It is a fun action movie to watch."
3,"Two Van Dammes,One Damme Good Movie...","I hate to say it but Van Damme's days as a box office superstar are over and probally we'll never see one of his flicks in theaters again.Replicant another film that went straight to video is a surprisingly good film.The film is directed by Ringo Ram,who also directed ""Maximum Risk$Q brings alot of story and thought into the picture.Even though we've seen two Van Dammes before like in ""Double Impact"" this one has a more convincing story.Michael Rooker who plays Detective Jake Riley really does a great job acting.Van Dammes acting was also good and it's the first time he's really acted like a child,it's really funny.Even though liscensed critics down the movie,I however like it enough so that I own the DVD,it's a great film to watch if you like drama,action and a great sequence to a storyline."
4,THIS SHOULD'VE HIT THEATRES,"IN AN ATTEMPT TO CATCH A SERIAL KILLER [VAN DAMME], THE POLICE CLONE THE SERIAL KILLER [THE CLONE IS ALSO PLAYED BY VAN DAMME]. HMM, THIS IS DEFINITELY A FIRST. NOT ONLY DOES VAN DAMME PLAY THE USUAL HERO, BUT HE ALSO PLAYS THE VILLAIN. VAN DAMME ACTUALLY MAKES A VERY INTRIGUING BAD GUY. THIS MOVIE IS DEFINITELY A HIGH STEP UP FROM MOVIES LIKE ''DESERT HEAT'' AND ''LEGIONNAIRE''. GOOD ACTION SEQUENCES AND A CLEVER PLOT. VAN DAMME SHOULD PLAY A VILLAIN MORE OFTEN. THIS SHOULD BE A TREAT FOR ACTION FANS AND VAN DAMME FANS ALIKE. ACTUALLY ONE OF VAN DAMME'S BEST MOVIES."
3,Classic JCVD vs. Dolph,"Although the film is slow as molasses in the middle, this little diddy from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin was entertaining enough to spawn sequels...laughable ones, but nonetheless this fun movie has a lot of flaws but if you are a fan of either of these action stars then this is a worthwhile view."
5,great movie bad blu transfer,i Love van damme movies he is the best too bad he is getting old no more slits thats done!! Overall the blu-ray to this movie is horrible same as dvd
4,Van Damne vs Van Damne,"Againg i saw this movie on T.V,and i loved it.Van Damne plays 2 characters.I character hes a killer that kills mom thats bad to their children.His other character is a clone so he could he get the bad one for this F.B.I agent.I loved this movie.I coudnt wait at the end becuase thats when Van Damne fights Van Damne.Good fight,they should make more of these.This movie is worth watching,trust me I am like a huge Van Damne fan and when I say his movie is good,then its good."
5,Replicant,"Replicant is one of VAN DAMME's good movie ever made by the ASIAN director RINGO LAM.It's a rearlly movies made ,with plot on DNA cloning,whitch is a real scintific process in are future. He plays this sereal killer,very strong,very smart.he goes all over the world, and can never be caught.The police hunting him manage to get a sample of his blood, and from this they make a duplicate with process of cloning,an exac duplicate of the killer, a Replicant,whitch they use the copy to track down the original killer.Jean Claude playes dual roles again like: DOUBLE IMPACT, MAXIMUM RISK and REPLICANT- revolves aroud this clone and original killer."
1,worst van damn movie he has ever made,this is pure crap dont buy this movie the story line might sound really good but trust me the way they did it sucks the whole movie van damn looks pathetic and im his biggest fan which makes me sad that they put him in this movie he really isnt even the main star and he plays two rolls this is just crap dont buy this movie its not even a kicking movie till the end which fight seen was a joke why people rated this movie so good idk but trust me its his worst movie ever
3,Almost...,"Maybe 3.5 stars would have been a more accurate rating for me.I certainly agree that Van Damme puts forth his best acting performance as the two characters. I like how even the fighting styles are different between the two (the killer being brutish and direct, the clone using excelent physicality and gymnastics maneuvers but little control). A well made film as well.But I really did not like Michael Rooker - either the actor or the part he played: a short fused, rather dense ex-cop. They could have explored the killer's mind a little more. The psudo-science used to explain the clone is also wrong - either use the ""genetic memory"" idea or the ""twin telepathy"" idea, not both.One neat touch is the killer's rap sheet - pause the film and look at his occupation."
4,Wham Bam Thanks Van Damm!,"Let's cut to the chase. You know what the movie is about. But what you don't know is that Van Dam became an actor. He is totally convincing in the dual roles. As the serial killer he shows us a dark side to his personality which works on all accounts. Focused and confident. As the Clone (Replica) he shows his more sensitive side. He even get's to do a little bit of the Tom Hanks in ""Big"" routine. Though I will admit I like him in the villan role. In all, the movie moves very well by the sure hands of it's director Ringo Lam. It has some very violent and realistic scenes that will frighten younger viewers so parents please be responsible and do not let them watch it at all. It is rated R. Thanks Van Dam for a excellent film.Some other Van Damm Films I recommend:TimecopSudden DeathMaximum Risk (Ringo Lam, Dir)Hard Target (John Woo, Dir)Nowhere to HideDeath Warrent"
4,"Yet another great Van Damme collection, one complaint...","I hardly need wax poetic about the merits of the films presented here, any Van Damme fan simply has to have KICKBOXER and UNIVERSAL SOLDIER in their collection. REPLICANT is perhaps the least interesting title presented here, but it's still a fun action romp.What is especially great about this release is that each film is on its own single-sided disc - no double-sided discs here. Curiously, however, all the films are widescreen except for KICKBOXER, which is presented here in fullscreen."
1,Sucked,I should have known that a Van Damme movie would not be worth the time or money. It simply sucked.
5,This is one of Van Damme's BEST!,"I saw this movie earlier this year, very good effects, stunts, fights, characters, story, acting and all! The entire package is there! I would recommend getting this movie on DVD. Its one of Van Damme's BEST films ever."
5,Works,Easy to use/program. I programmed one using a master remote for a main gate and the other for my garage.
4,Excellent Product,Great product for a good price. I bought this as a gift and the receipient liked it very much. High quality stainless with solid handles and other hardware.
5,Great deal at amazon only!!,"There are lot many reviews for this set, but I wanted to specifically mention about the cost at amazon!! I find 'em for the cheapest price here!! I got 2 of them and recieved the 25$ instant discount on $125 + $10 rebate on each set + 10% off offer on all the cookware. Overall I feel it as the best deal.And no comments on the set, it is gr8. Little bit not happy with the skillets, but the rest are shiny, durable, well designed.Go for it, its worth of value!!"
5,Still on the job after 39 years!,I've had my Farberware cookware for 39 years and have never had a problem with any of it. It has even heating and cleans easily.
1,Polish Rubs Off,"has anybody else noticed that when the pots are wet and wiped with a paper towel, a black residue appears on the paper towel? It's possible that this problem may have been caused by my dishwasher, but that's not supposed to be a problem with Farberware. I can't use these pots."
4,Farberware Classic 13-Piece Cookware Set,This is a wonderful set. I've bought one for my brother for his wedding gift. I spent way more than what amazon.com is selling it for here. This is a great deal. My mother has this set and she loves the way it cooks! I'm buying myself one to reward myself for a promotion.
3,Reasonable Value,"Two things struck me after purchasing this set. One, the pots are three smaller sizes and you realy need at least one 3.5 - 4 Qt pot at times. The second, while the aluminum sandwich bottom keeps hot spots and scorching from occuring on the very bottom of the pots. The sides are realativly thin stainless and the pot is actualy very hot around the outside diameter. This causes greater care to not scorch food than an expensive fully wrapped pot. That said the set can be a good value and if you put the real money in a higher end 4qt saucepan this would be a good set for utility."
4,Good cookware for the money,"I bought the cookware as an addition to my Circulon set. The pieces are not the highest quality but is very good for the price. They are thin and light for occasional ""quick cook"" but for the serious cook with intensive use I would recommend another set."
5,Incredible set of cookware,"This was my first full set. I've bought individual pieces, but nothing can come close to this for the price.The pamphlet that comes with the product says that the aluminum bottom distributes heat so well, you can cook everything on low to medium heat. They are right.The pots are stylish and well built. The pans are excellent -- eggs just slide off the non-stick surface. I'm very pleased with the set and saved ...at Amazon."
4,Quality Cookware,"This set included a good basic set of items. The quality of the material rivals more expensive brands. The construction seems the same also. A nice heavy, quality feel when handling the pieces. The aluminum and steel construction bottoms seems to heat up more quickly than regular steel cookware. The pieces store inside one another saving cupboard space and the lids work on several pans."
4,Great Set of Cookware,"I just recently purchased the 13 piece cookware set Stainless from Amazon and we are pleased as could be. The pots and skillets cook thoroughly and are or a high quality. The only complaint we have is the handles are not as fancy, aesthetically pleasing, or sturdy as my girlfriend likes. The handles are functional but a basic plain plastic black. But this is a minor complaint compared to the ability of these new pots and skillets to fix our meals. I also love the 3 Stainless steel containers that come with the set. They fit into each other and come with lids for easy storage. Be careful of the pot sizes, they are on the small side. Good Shopping."
4,Very respectable but a cadillac set,"Look, I bought this in Jul/07 for about seventyish and I have absolutely no regrets about this purchase. True, it's not gonna stand up to Analon, Caphalon pro and the like. But for sub $100 you can't go wrong if you take care of it. Analon is prettier and more durable - the handles on this leave a little to be desired compared with my caphalon pro pans. OVerall very satisfied, good bang for the buck."
3,Great pans - bad rebate,"We really love these pans. The quality seems excellent and they heat very even. I didn't realize how bad our current pans were until I got these.However, be very careful with the rebate. It's only 21 days from the date of purchase. So if it takes 2 weeks to arrive, you have 7 days to get that sucker in the mail or they will reject it. I'm so sick of companies doing everything they can to deny people from a legitimate rebate."
4,I am still pleased!,"Now that I am used to this cookware, I am so pleased with my purchase (I was used to using Mama's thick, heavy, iron cookware). I have had them for about a year now and, despite a little discoloration, they still cook everything perfectly, are a cinch to clean, and the handles are still on nice and tight. The two non-stick skillets have not scratched yet (I never use metal utensils with these). The only drawback to this set is that, because of the plastic handles, you cannot put them in the oven."
3,It won't last,The nonstick will not last more than a year under heavy use. The other pots are ok as long as you don't mind scrubing after using them.
3,Just OK,"The set is a definite upgrade from the cheap non-stick we had. It, however, leaves a lot to be desired.1. The handles are ok, but seem rather and don't make a good hold.2. Handle attachment to the body is not riveted, but soldered.3. All the pans are about the same size, not very useful. It's missing a wide pan."
1,Poor quality product,"After 2nd or 3rd usage, inside of the pots started to tarnished (not a food stain). Now the food cooked using these tarnished pots are tasting bit bitter (metallic taste). Very poor quality product."
1,"Missing piece, pictures can be deceiving","The lid from the smallest sauce pan was missing. I called and asked if they could send the missing piece. Instead of making it simple, they said I'd have to send the whole thing back to them. Because of this, I asked for a refund. The pans themselves also don't look nearly as good as they do in the photo. The lesson here is to not buy items like this online. Your best bet is going to a store and seeing what you are going to buy in person beforehand. Also, if you run into any problems, it's less of a hassle to take care of."
5,LOVE,"I use every single piece of this set every week. They have lasted forever. They're easy to clean, dishwasher safe and I have the perfect size for everything I need. I highly recommend every piece in this set."
4,Nice set,"This set was purchased for a camper, heats and distributes the temp well for a less expensive set, Farberware is a trusted name"
5,Farberware Classic 13-Piece,"This set is awesome. Nice and heavy, heats evenly, easy care. I highly recommend this product."
5,A Great Starter Set of Cookware,I purchased this set of cookware for my daughter who is a college student living with roommates in an apartment. She is very pleased with the variety of sizes of skillets and saucepans and is impressed with the way she can cook and not burn food like she did before. A real bargain!!
5,"Not A Cadillac, But Not A Yugo Either....","Farberware has been a mainstay in the American home for years. Although I am disappointed that it's now made in Thailand, what isn't? It is still good quality, heavy, transfers heat extremely well and is a joy to use. Whether one uses this set as a 'second', or as their primary cookware, one can't go wrong. Extra piece's are available on amazon, or at your local [store]. When buying cookware, remember one thing, a $10 fry pan or a $100 fry pan cooks a pound of hamburger equally well."
3,Farberware Set,"I am satisfied with this set of cookware. However, the information on the website was somewhat misleading. Only the fry pans are non-stick. I would have definitely preferred a set with non-stick surfaces on all of the cookware.I really like the mixing bowls with lids."
4,Works,"The pot is a good size and is sturdy. However, I would have like a clear lid better. Also the handles tend to get hot so I have to use mittens when take the pot off the stove to drain things like pasta. The price was good for what you get."
5,I love farberware's pots!,"You really can't go wrong with any of Farberware's pots! They really last a lifetime! I have the 3qt,6qt,8qt,1qt,and 2qt. The 3qt is the best for everyday! They will last for generations! My mother still uses them and I grew up with her cooking with them when I was a child and they still are excellent!Believe me you get your money's worth with Farberware! The classic collection is excellent! I know my sets will last as long as my mother's."
2,Little disappointed,"I'm a little disappointed with the 6 qt. pot from Farberware as the inside bottom is showing signs of rust! I just got this pan recently and have only used it a few times, I also noticed it's not made in the USA, so maybe inferior metal is being used. In the future I will think twice about buying from this brand again."
3,So-So Stockpot,"After reading the reviews, I thought this was going to be an awesome stockpot for cooking smaller quantities of pasta (which is just about all I make). It's just ok, nothing special. The handles get hot, and I have to use oven mits when I'm pouring the pasta into the colander -- this is not something I have to do with my other pots. Also, the handles have little drill holes and screws that are very apparent and make the pot look a little cheap. I was expecting better quality based on the reviews, so I was disappointed."
4,Good pot for the price - heavy,"It's a good pot but it's pretty heavy. It also makes some kindof weird noise when it's boiling, but everything seems fine. It was cheap and gets the job done."
5,Great Stockpot.,"Farberware Stockpot arrived in pristine condition. Has been used so far for boiling shrimp and pasta and as pot with vegetable basket for steaming vegetables.Cleans very easily and continues to look terrific.This product was puchased at Amazon, a site where I have also purchased Grandchildren Toys, Movies and Books."
5,Giving is an important part in one's life.,"Max Lucado's ""Jacob's Gift"" was the best book I've read in a long time! It shows how a young boy gave his project to the couple who needed it. I recommend this book to all young readers and teachers of all grades."
3,Could be better,"This was a book I read because it was my younger brother's book for his class, so I guess I might be hard on it because I usually don't like school books, but this book wasn't as good as his teacher seemed to think it was. It's also pretty religious, which might not be good if you're not into books like that. I'm not, so I might be too hard on it, though most of his class didn't enjoy it either. Though I agree with the review that said that a person could learn a about Jewish culture from this book. Mostly though, it wasn't that good. There are cooler books if you're looking for something that's supposed to be inspirational, or for elementary school kids, and probably something that's not religious."
5,always amazing,one of the best shows ever. dvd showed up fine with no problems. make the right choice. buy the dvd.
5,completely tight butthole,"In my opinion, the first season is the best. But this show makes me laugh every time i watch it. I've watched seasons 1 and 2 multiple times, and this show isn't old yet.Hopefully Amazon Video gets season 3 for complete purchase on here soon."
4,Awesome show,I love this show. It's probably one of the more hilarious series on television. It's what everyone would love to do if they irresponsible.
4,Workaholics,Every season just keeps getting better! This show is very funny - I highly recommended it! Every character is great.
4,Think Cheech & Chong in cubicles,"I was turned on to this rather obscure show from a friend of mine; previous to his recommendation, I had never heard of it before. After reading its many reviews, it seemed the depraved nature of the show would appeal to my sick sensibilities. I was right.The show, which focuses on the lives, careers, and THC levels of three stoner imbeciles whose makeshift fraternity is filled with enough juvenile hijinks to put Beavis and Butthead to shame, is lurid, offensive, and pretty tasteless. Nevertheless, it's pretty damn funny stuff.The acting is tight; the writing is clever (albeit in a sophomoric way), and the gags are memorable.If you're into ""It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia,"" ""Archer,"" and ""The League,"" then ""Workaholics"" may be for you."
5,Refreshingly funny,"This show is hilarious without being obnoxiously or ridiculously offensive. It's refreshing that it can be humorous without offending half of the world's population. It is not a particularly mature show, but it's meant to be light-hearted and not taken seriously. Every episode will make you laugh out loud."
5,The best season,"We're 4 eps right now into season 3 and it might turn out in the end to be the best season yet. But we'll have to wait and see, until then this is the best of the show so far. Along with The League its the best show on cable (Always Sunny is terrible now). You will especially love this show if you grew up in the 90's, tons of references."
4,Crafty humor,"Great show. These guys are committed to getting laughs. Though their method is certainly sophomoric, there's enough clever wordplay, deprecation, and pop culture reference that they're able to really get it to work."
3,Mehhh,"I liked this season more than the 3rd season, but not as good as season 1, by a long shot! Still, get it and watch it over and over. I tend to pop it in on a lazy Sunday :)"
1,Package Severely Damaged,"This is a great season and both DVD discs work perfectly fine; however, there is a large slash that runs down the front cover and flaps out. The top of the DVD case usually has a sticker. This case did not have a security sticker and looked as though this item was used and just repacked as ""new"". The back is severely dented in as well. I order from Amazon regularly and this is the first time I've ever had an item shipped that was in such poor condition."
1,Finding unworthy research to support questionable conclusions,"It's widely reported that the religious right makes up a little less than 40% of the Republican party...not exactly a controlling majority. To imply that they are driving all policy towards a theocracy is intellectually dishonest, but works as a great scare tactic.Please, look at some of the sources used in the research. To say that they lack credibility would be an understatement (Air America, etc?). But, books that are preaching to the choir are a dime-a-dozen these days. The author has his select audience and he's trying to give him what they want to hear and shaping the research to support his conclusions. There's nothing wrong with that, it sells books, just don't expect many of the arguments to hold water."
3,www.sportofdistraction.com,"From Mediacracy to American Dynasty, Kevin Phillips has continued to address large socio-political issues of the day. American Theocracy is no different.Phillips represents the sect of conservatism that loathes Bush, his leadership style, his background--basically, his complete embodiment. ""Sour grapes"" may also be driving such writing as has appeared in the last 2 books Phillips has produced, as the current conservatives controlling the country exclude the traditional conservatives that refuse to shut up and go by the new rules. Does that mean that his points are any less valid?..of course not.For some, this will be an eye-opener, for others it will provide reinforced arguments in support of circumstances that have already been identified.Either way---enjoy."
1,very one-sided,"By using a narrow view of historical religious expansionism, Phillips almost acts as an apologist for the religious right. It would be better if it had been written from a non-biased political view point."
5,Should be three books,"Three great essays, each of which should be a book by itself. I would love to have read much more about about the frightening religious fervor that permeates so much of American politics and which he describes so well. I often wonder what happened to the separation of church and state.We are becoming no better - or worse - than the third world countries, be they in the Arab world or elsewhere, that base their political, social and most frighteningly, their penal system on religious fanaticism. Of course they don't call it fanaticism. I perused most of the other reviews on Amazon, and it is interesting how members of the religious organizations Phillips describes are offended by the book. Well, what else is new!"
4,"Good points, but a tad outdated.","Beyond the busch bashing in this book there is a call to get real america! Get the republicans out of our churches and churches out of the republicans! Faith is fine, but it must be balanced with realism and levelheaded not the fake zeal we see today or in the past meant only to garner vote from the desperate and angry! You can't use God as an excuse for hatred or to do harm to other nations. When you use God, you take away the right of others to doubt and criticize you legitimately. Also our demands for oil and how we borrow money will destroy this nation. It is a wake up call for those who care for this nation to ignore the Christian right and get really right! Also we need to find ways to stop wall street from becoming a new way for government control and get oil's corruption out of our national politics. I think this book is timely and necessary and sadly nothing has changed yet."
4,Books to complement Phillips,"This is an ambitious book-a condemnation of oil addiction, theocratic posturing, voodoo economics, and the Iraq War-all wrapped together. The fact that Phillips was the intellectual architect of the Republican Party's ""southern strategy"" which allowed everything he now decries to develop only adds to its poignancy. Because Phillips attempts so much, however, he is bound to overreach. That's a fault, though, that can be easily remedied by adding a couple of excellent new volumes on kindred topics to your reading list. For a better appreciation of the deep historical background to the Iraq War, I would start with Greg Grandin's breathtaking new book about US involvement in Latin America, from the early nineteenth century forward. It's called ""Empire's Workshop."" Stephen Kinzer's ""Overthrow"" is also worthwhile, though less historically grounded."
4,American Theocracy,"Of the 20+ books I've read over the last year, this is one of the scariest.I highly recommend this book, a must read."
3,Southern Strategy,"Although Mr. Phillips makes a persuasive argument for the causes of ascension of radical right wing, he misses the biggest reason for their rise. If anybody should be familiar, it is he. The core of Nixon's ""Southern Strategy"" was to use RACE as a bait in getting white southerns to vote. Using the civil rights movement and protest on Vietnam war as an excuse to enforce law and order frenzy, the use of fear as political weapon was strong then as is now post 9-11. Don't underestimate the politics of boogy man."
2,American Theocracy,"Kevin Phillips makes some good points--over and over and over again. Big Oil has a dangerous degree of influence over the US and its policies. The Republican Party is in the sway of the religious right and the fundamentalists. There is a corresponding degree of clout in the southern states--reversing the reults of the Civil War. We have too much debt, in government, in families, in American businesses. All of this makes the future scary and could lead to the downfall of American preeminence, influence, etc. It happened before with Spain, the Netherlands and Great Britain. Dynastic leadership is bad for America. (OK, that was Phillips' last book, but he continues the drumbeat.) That's it, for this very pessimistic and depressing book. To me it seemed to be a literary fillibuster. Lots of data. Lots of redundency. There may be enough insight here to justify a couple of extended magazine articles. But a book? No way."
5,thought provoking,"helps to make sense of the insanity that's infested USA politics domestic and foreign policy in the last quarter century, with emphasis on the last 6 years."
5,Eye Opener,"This book will change what you thought you knew about gov't and special interests. Everyone thinks the gov't has always been controlled by special interests, but most don't understand how deep the connection is. And how long religion and oil(whale and from the ground)has controlled and steered this country from it's inception. This is not a politically motivated book, it's a ""history tends to repeat itself"" book. You will definitely learn a ton from this book. Top notch, but definitely not a optimistic view of the fate of the United States."
4,American Theocracy from a High School Standpoint,"This book does a great job of placing historical fact within the context and explaining how it can be seen in our govenment and how it is run. This book also talks about the flaws in our government such as the hot pursuit for oil, the ever growing growth of religious influence, and our constant attempts to grasp the entire world. I would suggest this book to history buffs and political science people alike."
3,The Big Picture,"My god, what a big ol' roiling, boiling mess of a book. A true policy wonk famous for prophesying and helping bring about the Republican conquest of the South, Phillips is now an apostate appalled at what he hath wrought.A numbers addict, Phillips lets loose the fire hose of polls, statistics, aggregates, disaggregates,and minutia in every nook and corner of his arguments. But it all adds up - the U.S.A is steadily plodding down a historically proven path of empirical decline. It is hopelessly addicted to a resource, oil, that cannot sustain it in perpetuity; it is awash in debt at every level fostered by a bewildering variety of debt instruments; and in thrall of a backward-looking zealous religious minority influential far beyond its actual numbers. Just look at the Dutch, the English, and the Spaniards as they fell from their heydays.Jaklak sez check it out."
3,"Pretty good, but....","I agreed with much of this book. thought by the Title it would primarily be about the dangers of religion in politics. However, it seems the author thinks ""radical secularism"" is almost as bad as fundamentalism. It does paint a bleak picture of the future of America. Another problem was it was a bit boring at some points. Finally, a critique I have of quite a few books I have read recently. Authors, PLEASE stop using endnotes! They are very difficult to look up! Either (perferably) use footnotes (at the bottom of the page) or put notes at the end of each chapter."
4,"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century","The book is intersting and helps a person understand how first coal and then oil dominated politics and decison making in Washington DC. I thought the Southern influence was very eyeopening. All of these factors have played into our military, political and socioeconomic complex status today. Our very extreme dependence on oil does not help our leaders necessarily make well thought out decisions."
1,Tactic to overwhelm,"This is just like the book ""Empire of Debt"", but it is doing a better job jamming a lot more data to overwhelm readers who are unprepared. Dependence on oil, religious right, and debt, we all know that. The problem is not if they are dangerous, the problem is how all these will lead to the conclusions that the author attempts to make. We keep on asking HOW, HOW, HOW; and the author just keeps on polluting with well-taken data, unrelated stories, and un-analytical information. Too many similar authors out there simply believe they can manage a political-economic topic with common sense, as long as they can overcrowd their book pages with enough data."
5,Prescient,"Drawing on historical precedents, Kevin Phillips paints a stark picture of the U.S.A. in her twilight; overburdened by an outrageously large and growing debt, dependent on a diminishing resource, and blinded and misled by fanatical religious elements. This book should be required reading for all high school seniors - we may be able to ""dodge the bullet"" if enough Americans understood the situation - but, alas, this will not happen soon."
1,Interesting bashing,Conservative bashing at it's finest. Blame Bush for the evils of the world.Interesting that 3 years of Obama and an uber left progressive agenda have accomplished.........?
5,American Theocracy,"I've been reading a lot of political analyses lately (Thomas Friedman's The World is Flat, T.R. Reid's The United States of Europe to highly recommend two) but for sheer, weighty scholarship this one takes the prize. Phillips' critique of an oil-based economy, religion in politics, and the American addiction to debt is meticulously cited, exhaustively examined and ultimately devastatingly conclusive, with a final paragraph that nearly moved me to tears. I wish I could say that I found it comforting to be told that this has all happened before, to the Romans, to the Spanish, to the Dutch and to the British. What really stings is that this guy is a Republican with serious street cred. He's not some wild-eyed way-to-the-left liberal, he's my dad."
5,"""Mr. President, Do You Believe We're In the End Times?""","That was the question the president couldn't answer in his press conference earlier this week. If you want to understand why he couldn't just say ""No, what are you, nuts?"" - the answer's in here.Highly recommended!"
5,Great for fans of Tenchi Universe.,This CD is great if you're a fan of the Tenchi Universe series. I highly reccomend it.
3,Shawn's take on doppelganger,"The movie it's self was ok for me & I fill it is A good late night movie to rent or watch on TVwith some friends on A Sat night. The ending was weird but works I guess. for those interested in watching it just to see Drew Barrymore naked, you do get some good boob action but it's not as long as you would like & half the time she's covered in blood."
1,Good Enough to be Forgotten,"I enjoy movies with Drew Barrymore but this movie must have had the lowest budget ever! Through most of the movie, you are not sure of the outcome. Which makes a good suspense film, again, despite the budget. The ending, well, let's say they should have ended the movie earlier as the last scenes cause the film to go from good to horrible."
1,"hysterical, and then, just bad, mostly","i cannot, with good conscience recommend this movie.please, look at it! it's awful!drew barrymore, in her sad ""poison ivy"" stage, is a wretched performer. there are pothole plothole's all over the place. and it's itchy to watch the scene with her real mother, jaid barrymore. were they attempting reconcilliation through a b-movie?oh! and the guy from adventures in babysitting, father of the bride & a few episodes of friends is in it, fumbling around too. where is that guy?there's a tough broad friend, a spooky house & at one point SPOILER: drew splits in half all oogy and walks around like some really skinny anatomy horror movie thingy.hey! now it sounds kind of good again."
2,Super-awful,"It gets two stars for the unintentional comedy. Other than that, it's one of the worst of the ultra-cheesy, predictable, low-budget horror movies from the early nineties. The FX are funny at first, but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy. The acting is uniformly terrible, and one has to image that the typically enjoyable Barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her."
1,a putrid stinker of a film,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever wasted my time watching! Don't dispose a precious cent on this movie unless you are a gigantic Drew Barrymore fan and you are merely viewing the movie for the raw sex scenes and constant,random nudity. The storyline could have worked, yet the movie is pathetically low budget, the acting is horrid and the movie falls desperately flat. It is impossible to like this movie unless you are obsessively in love with Drew Barrymore and you want to watch her at her lowest point. It's so bad that I had to come here to vent about it online. The director was obviously a film school drop-out who offered the actors free cocaine and produces low budget porn."
3,Okay for the price,"I bought this for nursing school and unfortunately it just won't hold all of my books. I do like the alternative shoulder straps since I have to carry it upstairs also. I definitely put a lot in it and so far so good, but I am only 3 weeks in so hopefully it will hold up. For the price I paid, it was a good deal. I just needed something bigger and sturdier for nursing school."
3,wheeled backpack,"the back pack is alright.What is not ok is that even if I have been a regular client for Amazon for the past 4 years, now I have to pick up my stuff in the post office. I buy online to save time but If I have to pick up my stuff anyway, then I rather go shopping."
3,This thing is HUGE!,"I realize it's supposed to be one-size-fits-most, so I shouldn't have been surprised by the large size. On the other hand, the manufacturer really should make this in small, medium, and large because a small person like me will be swimming in this costume. I wouldn't recommend this costume unless you would take at LEAST a medium size. I also would recommend that you find a different belt to wear with it because the one that comes with it is pretty tacky-looking. This costume doesn't have a hood, so if you are set on having a more authentic-looking costume, this isn't the one for you. The wig was a bit small, but that's something that will be different on everybody."
1,waste of money,"I couldn't believe how cheap this costume is for the price. The hair is a very dark color and didn't even stay up through the night. I even bought extra bobby pins and it still fell. The dress is a piece of fabric, very simple and very cheap."
4,Princess Leia costume,Even though it is a one size fits all... It fit me pretty well! The costume was well made and the price is reasonable. It was a great buy!
3,good enough,"The wig seemed very amateur and the belt it just a piece of screen printed fabric. As I put it on I thought it was only worth 2 stars. It was comfortable and easy to wear, though. I received a multitude of positive comments on the awesomeness of my costume so I changed it to 3 stars."
2,Cheaply made,"I bought this and ended up returning it. The ""belt"" included is a piece of fabric with the silver buckles painted on that you tie behind your back. The dress itself is a cheap see-through fabric. I didn't take the wig out to look at it because I knew as soon as I saw the rest of the product I was returning it and I couldn't return it if the wig was opened. I returned the product and made my own with higher quality fabric at a fraction of the price. It may not be the licensed product but it looks nicer. If I were in charge of Star Wars licensing I would be embarrassed to offer such a chintzy product with the SW logo attached."
5,Princess Leia costume,The item was just what I ordered. It came on time and was new and packaged well. I was quite happy with this product and ths company.
4,Dirty Norsemen?,"Ok, so the production is not near as pretty as it is on the other two albums. All the lyrics are in Norwegian, so I dont understand most of it, but I have an idea. Half of the songs are intrumentals. Believe me...this record is much more ""raw"" then the other nicely produced albums, this one is actually BLACK METAL. This is for the true Borknagar fans, if you are only fimilair with the latest recording this one will surprise you! Its defintaly worth the cost if you are into rusty metal viking music???? I dont know exactly, do not trust me..."
3,"Decent, but a few problems","The headset seems to pick up the user's speech fairly well. However, a steady ""clicking"" sound will sometimes arise which both the user and the person on the other end can hear. I tried to adjust the connection between the headset and the phone, but the noise persisted. It doesn't happen all the time, but does happen fairly often.Another feature that would have been nice but was not included is a button on the wire (as with wireless headsets for other phones) that allows the user to answer and hang up without having to deal with the phone itself.Overall, seems to be the best product available for the Nextel Iden series, but is not a great product."
4,I've got the ice in me.,"Considering that Enemymine is the work of Zack Sally, Danny Sasaki and Mike Kunka you might wonder how a double bass - one drummer band works. The answer is heavy and quite well. This EP contains my favorite song by Enemymine: I've Got the Ice in Me. However, the EP is quite heavy and the sounds that Kunka and Sally create with their basses is incredible. Sadly, like godheadSilo, Enemymine was not all that well known. If you are interested in Dead Low Tide or Smoke and Smoke give Enemymine (and godheadSilo) a try."
5,AN EYE OPENER!,Beottner does well to present the factual attributes of the Roman Catholic system. His writings are very easy reading- hard to put down. Artful comparisons between Protestants and Catholics.
1,Roman Catholicism,"Highly unscholarly. At least one major error on every page. Pick a page, any page. And the allegations can be easily refuted. It will never be considered a ""scholarly book"". A comic book.... perhaps. A real scholar once told me, ""All the claims can be easily refuted. It would be funny, if it wasn't for the fact that so many people take it seriously"". As for sources.... none. Oh yes, they are shown, but if you follow them it goes something like this.... A points to B, B points to C, C points to A. Basically they are pointing to each other for proof. Very poorly done. I would suggest reading ""Fathers Know Best"" by Jimmy Akin if you want to study the early Christians."
1,A very poor source of facts; a very great source of lies,"If writers got points for misconceptions and sneaky tricks, L.B. would be on top of them all. This book is full of twists, turns, misconceptions, and outright lies about the Catholic faith. As a Catholic, this book was enough to put me on the borderline of laughing and crying. I can personally refute most of the claims he makes, but Karl Keating, Scott Hahn, and Patrick Madrid do wonderful jobs at this on books already in print and available here. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE CATHOLIC FAITH, go read the books from the afore-mentioned authors. This book is a book of outright lies."
1,Eye opening,"It's amazing how gullible some people can be.I bought and read this book when I was evangelical.I then began to examine the issues in it, and, seeing not only the inaccuracies and misrepresentations in this book, but also seeing the historical, theological and BIBLICAL cohesion of the claims of the Catholic Church, I became Catholic.Need I say more?"
2,Romantic Anti-Romanism,"The author, anti-dispensationalist postmillennialist Loraine Boettner, began his analysis (pp. 4-7), hit-job, on Roman Catholicism, published in July 1962 and October 1989, by insisting that the Papacy can not be considered a good bulwark against Russian communism and its expansion in Eastern Europe. Hmmm, kind of like Pope John Paul II was not a good ally of President Reagan ? John Paul II and his support of Solidarirty was not at all helpful ? It begins with intellectual incongruity and regresses on each page. Good laugh for those who read anti-Catholic propaganda. Read Boettner's anti-dispensationalist postmillennialism in his Millennium."
1,"Full of misrepresentations, misconceptions, and false history.","""Roman Catholicism"" seems like an accurate, well-researched book, but it is nothing more than an outlet for Boettner's hate of Catholics. It frequently alters quotes and uses biased sources, because this is what fundamentalists have to do to defend their beliefs. Karl Keating's book, ""Catholicism and Fundamentalism"", completely exposes this hateful work."
1,A textbook for anti-Catholic people,Boettner offers a classic presentation of what the Catholic Church DOES NOT teach.
1,A former Beottner fan recants,"I once had high respect for Lorraine Beottner until I checked out the facts. This book is an absolutely atrocius work that caricatures the Church and distorts the facts. It is full of many historical errors easily verified. My faith in Protestantism was shaken after checking the facts. It is sad that so many Protestants use this as a primary source of arguments against the Church when it has long been refuted. Actually, many Protestant scholars admit that this book is unreliable. Seeing the countless errors in this ""Bible of anti-Catholicicsm"" through research had alot to do with my conversion to Catholicism."
1,"If you are an anti-Catholic, this book is for you","""There will come a time when men will no longer put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own selfish desires, they will surround themselves by a great number of teachers telling them what their itching ears want to hear."" This is the what Boettner has done in this book: what many call the ""Handbook of Anti-Catholicism."" It is filled, cover to cover, with half-truths and lies regarding the Catholic faith. If you want the Catholic (truthful) response to Boettner's book, please read CATHOLICISM & FUNDAMENTALISM by Karl Keating. Keating demolishes Boettner's ROMAN CATHOLICSM verse by verse."
1,Good for a bookend and not much else,"Lorriane Boettner has no clue as to what he is talking about. I was on the verge of leaving the Church and then I read his book. Looked up the facts and realized how off-base he is. If you want inaccuracy, distortion, illogic, and straw man arguments read this book. But if you want the Truth then ignore this books and read ""Catholicism and Fundamentalism"" by Karl Keating, ""Fundamentals of the Faith"" by Peter Kreeft, and ""Rome Sweet Home"" by Scott and Kimberly Hahn. I would give this no stars, but I can't."
2,"unscholarly, biased and angry",The problem with this book is that is wholly unscholarly. The author makes all sorts of extravagant claims against the Roman Catholic Church and almost always either fails to correctly cite the material or it is found to be completely out of context. There are dialogs that could be opened about Roman Catholicism but this author's work can only serves as an embarrassment for the arguments Boettner and his modern constituents are making. There are many more balanced and scholarly materials available throughout amazon.com and the Internet. I would suggest looking there.
1,A book for the ignorant bigot,"This book appeals to the ignorant bigot who is too simple and lazy to invest the necessary time and effort to explore the fascinating topic of the differences between Catholicism and Protestantism. For the thoughtful and curious people, I would recommend The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice, by Philip Jenkins."
1,Wrong Wrong WRONG!,"Oh come on! EVEN if you don't agree with Catholicism (as a future seminarian, I happen to) you can find BETTER material. I mean, if any educated Catholic tells you that this stuff is rubbish, you should believe them. We are not ashamed of our beleifs nor do we hide from our history. There was an inquisition (even though it was NOTHING like most Protestants try to make it), there were and are some problems (not in DOCTRINE, perhaps in management and catechesis), but nothing to the distorted degree presented in this work of fiction. I highly recommend that this book be buried forever as it might be MORE useful as landfill!"
1,dishonest,Unscholarly would be too nice a term for this book. It is intellectually dishonest. Non-academic propoganda. I would rate it a zero if I could. Enough said.
5,A summation of the false doctrines of the Catholic church,"As a Roman Catholic, who during my early adult life was searching for spiritual truth, this book helped me to learn of the anti-scriptural basis of doctrines of the Roman Catholic church. If you would like to seriously study Roman Catholic church doctrines, and how they compare and contrast to the truth revealed in the Bible, this will be an incredibly important book for you to read and study."
1,Don't waste your time,Poorly written with little scholarly merit or research value....just validates the theory that a good majority of fundamentalists are more concerned with discrediting Catholic tradition than they are about justifying their own flawed religious beliefs...
1,Trash scholarship,"I read this book some 30 years ago. I was then reading a lot of Catholic and Protestant books. It didn't take me long to discern that his book was trash then, and it is still a heap of trash today. Basically, it is a book of lies and a playground for the devil. It demonstrates how low an obstinate and foolish Protestant will go to attack the bride of Christ. Read Matt 7:21-23."
1,I worry about those who take this book seriously,This book is fiction. Sad fiction at that. Ridiculous fiction actually. Note the dearth of footnotes or authoritative quotes. This book was written by a man who was clearly an anti-Catholic bigot -- often times for people who are on the same ungodly road as the author was on until he passed away and came face to face with his judge -- Jesus Christ.This book is such a horrible fabrication of hatred and lies that I truly wonder about the spiritual and intellectual health of those who actually recommend this fetid work.Don't waste your time. This is sewage. You can read these sorts of lies on the web for free...
1,Be Careful,"If you read this, be sure to also read ""Catholicism & Fundamentalism"" by Karl Keating. (at the very minimum, read Chapter 2 of C&F, which deals specifically with this book.)"
1,Big bunch of nonsense....,"Lots of out-right lies about the Church, completely undocumented naturally, plus some shaky theology added in. It's best to trust pretty much nothing found in this book, unless you've some some INTENSE fact-checking first.If anyone takes Boettner's pseudo-Christian snake-oil seriously, I beg them to contact me so that I can help them out..."
1,Not all factual,"If you come anywhere close to this one, better have your theological library nearby."
5,If half of this book is true....,"I am a young reader in high school. I attend a Classical School, study Latin, Greek and the Great Books. If half of this book by Boettner is true, it is enough to condemn this church. The chapter on the Confessional appears more hideous than all the gods and goddesses in all the ancient civilizations. I am very interested in this subject and will be getting more books. I am planning to get a degree in classics and ancient literature. If just half of this book is true.....well, one must love slavery."
1,"May God have mercy on you, seriously!","Wow, what can I say? Totally ignorant, very very poorly done or just plain intentional lies to mislead people. Even those people who don't have any faith affiliations and atheists will find this book beyond poorly researched.I totally get it if one's own or other christian denomination's interpretation of the Bible is different from Roman Catholism and her teachings but when people (especially this book) intentionally MISREPRESENTS, fabricate lies that the other Church TRULY teaches, it borders bigotry and hatred which is against the 9th Commandment of God, ""Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor"".Please for humanity's sake.....read a lot of good historical books specially the other's side OFFICIAL teachings and not just from some disgruntled priest, nun or unverifiable source and lastly....be honest!"
1,Unscholarly? Yes. Should you get it? Yes.,"I'm a catholic apologist and even though there are holes in this book ""big enough to drive trucks through"", the fact remains that, in my experience, many of our protestant bretheren still use the stuff in this book. I don't know why but they do. And so, you need to to know all the ""bad"" arguments that they will come up with and this book has them all. Some of it is pretty funny. Anyone who wants to defend the faith should get this book.If you need answers to this book, you can check out, ""Catholicism and Fundamentalism..."" by Karl Keating. He goes through ""Roman Catholicism"" piece by piece. I gave this book one star because of all the reasons listed in the other reviews above. He does quote pretty accurately (assuming he has a source at all), but he quotes all of it out of context. So be prepared."
1,A BOOK OF LIES EVEN A BAPTIST (me) WOULDNT BELIEVE,"No, I am not Catholic, but after looking at this book I have realized that it is nothing more that a book full of lies - thousands of items and quotes taken out of context so that they seem to be the truth. This book has been turning devout Christians against their faith for a long time and I think that it is time for that to stop. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU WANT TO BURN IT. As a Christian we should strive to build each other up no matter what the doctrinal differences are - so this book is a piece of trash."
1,A Good Fantasy,"Mr Boettner's book has absolutely no basis in the real world. I think it is safe to say there are factual errors on nearly every page, and even when he does get it right, he often distorts the facts. Catholics should read this just to see how far anti-catholics will go!"
1,Intellectually Dishonest or Ignorant Bigotry? You Decide,"This embarassment of a book has been completely and irrefutably debunked byCatholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on ""Romanism"" by ""Bible Christians""by Karl Keating. Boettner was horribly misinformed about what Catholics actually believe or was so blinded by anti-Catholic bigotry that he didn't care to get his facts straight. Any fool can knock down a straw man, which is all that Boettner does in this book. If you believe that fundamentalists are right and Catholics are sadly misguided and bound for Hell, I dare you to read Keating's book, cover to cover."
2,Polemic,"I bought this book because it was given either one or five stars. So I thought it must be very (!) controveral. If you are looking for a scholary insight in catholic theology, you will be at the wrong place. You can get better books on this subject by evanglical scholars. I highly recommend the book of John Armstrong (ed.)""Roman Catholicism etc"". To get catholic theology right read catholic sources and compare it with the evangelical view. If you do this you get some new ideas and possibillities to interpret scripture. Especally if you compare the modern evangelical thoughts with the Early Fathers. There you can see protestant errors, but also catholic errors. For an honest seeker of information this book is too polemical, but it is not as bad as some of the (fundamentalist) catholic rewiewers said."
1,Utter trash; a look into the heart of Ant-Catholic bigotry,"As a biblical scholar of sorts, I thought that I would find some interesting arguments in this book. However, what I actually found was a book FULL of claims with virtually no referencing to sources. This book is such a farse of intellectual trash that it does not warrant reading.The sad fact is that this book tells you less about Roman Catholicism and more about fundamentalist bigotry. His list of Catholic inventions is a ridiculous attempt at scholarly insight and he actually has factual errors in the list. Some dates are totally wrong and other ""inventions"" can be seen in practice long before the ""invention"" date, even in non-Catholic writing! Mr. Boettner, thank you for retiring. When you eventually pass on, I hope the anti-Catholic sentiment of your work passes with you."
2,Good idea that fails in implementation,"I originally was quite interested in seeing this film after reading a lot of good press about it. When I finally did see the film theatrically I mainly saw little more than the failed possibilities.In my opinion the greatest weakness is in focus. The two founders are not particularly interesting characters and the choice to focus on them to the exclusion of the company itself brought the film down. As well there are significant time gaps in the growth of govWorks.com while other sections (most notably the rather boring part about securing venture capital) are given a disproportionate share of the time. In the end I never was able to care about the characters or gain any real feeling for the company they founded. It could have been about any other business that failed with very little that was specific to the time, place, or culture that surrounded the Dot-Com Boom and why it went bust."
5,"Great, observational documentary","One of my favorite documentaries, ""Startup.com"" follows two high school friends as they create an internet business together.Besides catching history on film, the filmmakers document what happens when friendship enters the business realm."
4,AMBITIONS FOR THE 21st CENTURY,A really nice documentary film from Chris Hegedus (The War Room) and Jehane Noujaim about a group of friends who start a dot com company and they climb allmost on the top.The every day running the relationships between them the strugle to survive and make people and investors to believe in them are given with a plain and simple way which on the other hand makes the film fascinating.It could be more specific about the industry and how it really works instead of passing fast this stage and this is a missing point but the whole movie is fast just like the success and the failure in todays world.I really did have good time watching this movie.No doubt it leaves you wondering if having just good friends-partners and bright ideas this is enough to survive in the modern bussines world or because of the globalization the good days are gone forever.See it it is worthy
4,How the old new economy failed,"How could so many companies capitalizing on what is undoubtedly the most amazing media innovation since the television fall so far so fast? Startup.com offers some important clues.Skilfully, the filmakers show us how the protagonists labor to secure tens of millions in financing, and how they use this to build a company with over two hundred employees. Repeatedly, I found myself thinking: ""All this, just for a website?"" Lone individuals have certainly built much greater things given enough nights hacking away at a laptop (Shawn Fanning and Napster comes to mind). And the really amazing thing is that Tom and Kaleil don't even have a website, or a secure (much less growing) client base by the time they have invested these millions. Could this unproven, top-heavy model be a reason why the Internet economy seemed to fail, even though there's no reason it can't be a success?"
4,Pretty Realistic,"I went through the dot com boom and this was totally realistic. It chronicles a real world view of what was going on behind the companies insid ethe bubble. I think the overall lesson from the bubble is that valuation, profits, and experience matter. This is what the bubble era lacked and this documentary covers it well. These guys had no business running a company, getting funding, and were little concerned with producing a quality product that had longevity. Shame on them for going into business but moreso for those VC's giving them money....so it went.From my experience, most of these types of people went out of the industry to easier stomping grounds to get their MBA's, have babies, or become accountants. Some have moved onto the new frontier of other start-up areas and have not learned their lesson either. However, some have learned a great deal from the bubble, continue to innovate and are well positioned to be the names of tomorrow."
3,Anthropological Record of the Decline and Fall of the West,"This will be as valuable to future anthroplogists after this civilisation has gone the way of all self-indulgent greed-obsessed cultures, as the murals of Pompeii's preening elite. The two main characters are equally obnoxious and equaly revealing of all that's wrong with this culture of money and ignorant selfishness. All the 'extras' floating around in the background who get churned in the delusional business fantasies of these two idiots are far more interesting, but we dont get to hear much about them. Enron wasnt a fluke, judging by this film."
3,They were doomed from the start,"Startup.com is a decent view of modern man. Two freinds start a company that allows New Yorker's to pay thier parking tickets online. The first forty minutes is these two buds getting money. The internet is new and investors see oppurtunities. They get some money and one visit to Silicon Valley foreshadows their future. They are inexperienced. The rest is a downward spiral thet is sometimes shocking of how freinds treat each other in moments of crises. I wish someone would give me 25 million to bomb a business. Worth watching for a documentary, but it will not be missed."
3,Interesting But Unsatisfying,"This documentary shows WHAT happened to this ridiculous ""dot com"" adventure but it doesn't show enough HOW or WHY. There's too much emphasis on personal stuff. We don't get to see much about how the web site/business functions. I want to know more about the financial state of affairs, how investors reacted, etc. It just shows the business getting up with a huge staff and then jumps to a virtually empty office.Kaleil is a young man in over his head who had good intentions and great ambition but no experience and little business savvy. Tom Herman is a pissy, whiney little brat, but somehow Kaleil puts up with him.There was too much chatter between Tom and Kaleil and not enough ""documenting"" of GovWorks, an archetype of the ""dot com"" mania."
4,Must Watch,"I didn't even know about the govWorks.com project before I watched this movie. It truly shows that you can't go into a business and try to get rich...with your friends.The story line is pretty hard to follow at some points, but I liked it."
1,The story of two chuckleheads,"Two jackasses are funded for an otherwise brilliant idea. Problem is, the two chuckleheads, Kaleil (this guy is self-inflated throughout the whole movie) and Tom couldn't run a toaster let alone a business. Not surprisingly, the whole 'empire' comes crashing down on the both of them. The most work I think they ever did in the movie was film themselves and show everyone how important they thought they were.This is a typical case study of how not to run a business. It is a great behind the scenes of who was running the ""new economy"". It will be no surprise to you after watching this movie why the bubble burst."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was a big fan of ""War Room"" from the same creative team, but this effort is not a worthy sequel. The guys that start the company (govworks.com) seem to be a couple of dopes out of their element from the word go, and all the ""we aren't a business, we are a family"" BS was just flat out stupid - no wonder they failed. That aside, what is really lacking in the movie is a narrative that gives the viewer more info on how the company is really doing when the spaghetti hits the fan at various points. We know the business is running into problems, but no real details are provided - just the two guys screaming into their cell phones. Too bad - better organization and background narrative to go along with the human element would have made this a much better documentary."
2,You go girl!,"I really didn't learn why this company failed or even exactly what they were trying to sell, but with over five scenes of him working out in the gym, I sure got to know how really buff Kaleil is. Excellent!"
5,"Sturdy, well-made ergonomic handle","This is a good button hook. the zipper pull is handy, as well. Sturdy and the handle is a god design. The shipping was outrageous, however. No fault of the product, though."
1,Im sorry,I really don't like to leave bad reviews but this has got to be the worst piece of trash I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. If I didn't get it as a gift I would have thrown it up it in the air and blown it away with my shot gun gathered together all the pieces and shot them again. Then after I was done with that I would have to light them on fire put the ashes in a box tie it to a brick and throw it is a deep river Jumanji style.
5,Must have for any kitchen,"This stockpot is a good size for making soup, stew, pasta & chili. It can be used to make two very satisfactory portions or four normal portions (for normal eaters, unlike myself). It is not too large and unwieldy, especially loaded with food. It is simple to clean, conducts heat very well and a delight to use! An excellent value. Farberware also makes a nice pasta insert which is a great addition to this pot."
5,WONDERFUL POT,"You really can't go wrong with any of Farberware's pots! They really last a lifetime! I have the 3qt,6qt,8qt,1qt,and 2qt. The 3qt is the best for everyday! They will last for generations! My mother still uses them and I grew up with her cooking with them when I was a child and they still are excellent!Believe me you get your money's worth with Farberware! The classic collection is excellent! I know my sets will last as long as my mother's."
4,Very pleased,There product is very well made. The lid forms a tight seal. The rivets on the handles are not exposed which makes cleaning easy. My only complaint is that the handles get hot.
4,Great Pot,Does just what it says it does!! I bought this particular pot because of the reviews and I am pleased.
5,A huge success,"I bought this for my mother and father who love the Open Road song in the car advert, but had never heard of this gentleman. This CD has been a huge success with them."
3,Lots of Business Terms But...,"As a business student I love the comprehensive finance and econ terms. The only problem that I have with the dictionary is that there are no hiragana or katakana pronunciations provided. Granted,you can always use this in conjunction with some kind of online dictionary to get an accurate pronunciation, but I feel that most Japanese language students expect pronunciation to be part of a ""dictionary""."
3,"Yes, But!","This is their weedless prop.That means the blade sweeps a little longer on the hub.The pitch is the same on all Minn Kota motors, 4"".That means that no matter how small and light weight the boat; no matter how many or what size minn Kota motors you put on it, you will only get a maximum of about 3 mph, period. But this one has more surface area, so it has more drag and even less speed.What we really need is an aftermarket higher pitched prop."
3,Too many dead beans,"Great but too many dead. And Amazon won't back it up. I bought ten orders, got three money backs, . Very disappointing jumping beans. But when they work, they are great. My cat loves them."
2,mexican jumping beans take a fall,the toy is ir awhile and then it gets really boring!your dog can eat them to! I dont think that thats healty for the dog!
2,Movie was good... DVD was average.,I liked the film... as it is similar in style to The Thin Man and Charlie Chan series. Rod LaRoque does a great job as THE SHADOW. Having said that there are probably better prints of this film on the market.
2,Shadow is visible,"""The Shadow Strikes"" is nothing more than a B-movie detective story. There is nothing shadowy about the Shadow; the flm has no special effects -- I am sure the budget had no money for any effects. It's run of the mill style of B movies of the 30s. It's okay if you have no great expectations of being much entertained."
1,last about 5 minutes,"I was excited to get these, and I loved them for a day, but then they kept breaking one after the other. If I left them on a cup for a long time (or sometimes just a short time), they would eventually just pop off at the seam. And now I feel bad that I'm tossing all this worthless plastic into the garbage where they will be leaching plastic yuckiness into the landfill for years to come. Love the idea, but they are poorly made. Skip them!!"
3,"Good, but the others in this line are better","These beer bands are great - but I prefer the ""personality"" and ""bombed"" styles more and here's why. The set of 12 that I got included several colors that were very similar. I don't know about your friends, but my friends aren't going to be able to discern yellow from mustard or teal from green... ESPECIALLY when they've had a few of the beverages for which this product is made. Besides, the ""personality"" and ""bombed"" ones are more fun. Now where's my beer... oh that's right I'm the fuschia... or am I the sea foam green?"
2,Not weatherproofed--will rust out on you,The design is great-convenient. But it's in no way weather resistant. It will quickly begin to show signs of rust. After 3 years on my car (I leave it on as I bike year-round) it's totally rusted out.
3,"Okay, but too expensive for everyday use","I got a sample pack of a few of these in the mail. I tried them out on my son. They worked great and I loved the easy clean up. I checked them out at the store, but as much as I love them, I couldn't justify the price. I did by a box, but use them strictly for when we eat away from home. I also bought a five pack of plastic bibs and I put them in the top rack of the dishwasher and they come out clean. These are a good idea, but too expensive for everyday use."
3,I don't remember purchasing this product.,I don't remember purchasing this product. It must have been a Baby Shower gift.
5,Farberware 3-Quart Saucepan,"I had been reluctant to order this Farberware pan because someone had said it was not the heavy duty pan of a few years ago and that the handle was flimsy. I finally bit the bullet and ordered it because I have another one this size and it is my most used pan. I have a new glass top stove and some pans will rock on the burner and not heat well, I needed a completely flat, heavy bottom. This new one is all of that and more. I could not be more pleased. it is super quality. I highly recommend it.Rita"
4,3 quart saucespan,"Product was found to be as represented. functionlly good, and useable. Delivery was prompt. I bought it using the iphone 4 s , and it was a satifactory way of purchase."
2,buy a philips screwdriver too,"As a cooking pot it is fine, but ever since I got it, I've had to tighten the handle every two weeks. I even put a drop of super glue in the hole before tightening it, but it still came loose after a while. Oh well, you win some you lose some."
3,Great pot - bad handle,"I loved this saucepan and used it happily for many years. It felt like it would last forever - really terrific quality! But then the handle, which is only affixed by one screw, started getting loose; the insert into which it screwed became stripped; and then some nut on the inside, which is what the screw fastened into, became loose. The handle fell off, and it can't be fixed. What a crummy end for an otherwise great pot! It's made me quite leery of buying any other Faberware products."
2,Nothing like the original!,"While I agree this pan is good looking, it's not good cooking! Takes a long time to heat up and bottom does not heat evenly. If I'd known Farberware had changed their ""classic"" pan, I wouldn't have bought it. My advice--look for another brand."
3,Farberware Classic Pans,"I'v had them for about 10 years and have only one complaint, but it's one that will prevent me from buying the same line again: The handles have screws that loosen and, over time, the screw heads strip and get impossible to tighten. As a result the handles are always loose."
5,lasts forever,I received farberware pots for shower gifts 42 years ago...I use them everyday and they still look great...I haven't lost a handle yet. Picked up this 3 qt because I did not have that size...love it!
2,Stainless steal,"As I said in the previous review, I thought that even though the pan was stainless steal it was a darker color. I was a little disappointed"
1,POOR quality,I had a farbaerware saucepan for 41 years. It received frequent use and was a great product. I finally decided to replace it. The new saucepan is already pitted inside and the lip around the ouside edge is impossible to clean. The bottom of the pot has scratched the top of my stove. I really wish I hadn't disposed of the old one. This one belongs in the trash.
5,Farberware Classic S/S 3-Quart Covered Saucepan,"Compared to other products on the market that sell for an outrageously amount of money you can't beat Farberware. I have been cooking for over sixty years and I have always bought Farberware and would not waste my money on any other brand.,"
4,Seems to work fine.,I bought this to replace my blower motor in a 2000 Jeep wrangler. It has been working great but has started to squeak the other day when you first turn it on. So I am not sure how much longer it will last. But for the price it is what you get. Got me through last summer. We shall see how it does this year.
2,Noisy,"Tested fan operation right after installation and it worked great, just very noisy. The more the fan gets used the quieter it gets, like it sat on a shelf for years before it was purchased. pleased with operation, but very disappointed with noise."
5,Perfect fit and operation,Perfect replacement to my worn out and dead blower assembly. Fairly simple to install in my 1999 Jeep Cherokee Classic once you figure out the best angle to get the old one out. There are only three 8mm screws and one wire harness to remove and re-attach. Save money and do it yourself.
1,Worked for an hour,"Beware. They send faulty equipment and then expect you to fix it yourself at your own expense. The shut off switch stopped working after just one hour of use. They sent us a new part, but it's complicated to switch, and you have to have the right tools, which we don't. We paid thousands for a brand new item, and received a faulty item with no support to fix it. We are considering sending it back for a refund. Very disappointing."
1,Painful to Watch,"I am very interested the subject matter of this film, but the film is terrible. I have read Shulgins' books and many others. I was really looking forward to this movie when I bought it.This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen.The editing is bizarre and disorienting. The movie does not flow. The movie is basically a collection of video clips, randomly cut and mixed together with no sense of proper timing or coherence. The result is a jarring experience that is hard to watch. I felt it was giving me a headache.Making matters worse, there was no narration or story flow. Some of the clips had no apparent connection to the subject matter.We made it through about half the film before turning it off.Its a shame that such fascinating subject matter was treated with such carelessness.Seriously, this is the worst documentary ever made."
4,Love it !,This is a must see for one of the greatest chemist's of our time ! Shulgin & his wife are my hero's :)
4,Pretty good documentary on an amazing man!,Was hoping for a more current take but all in all a great subject to be explord and could have been done better in my opinon but gotta respect the mans work and life :)))
2,Fails to recognize the beauty of Faulkner's lingusitc style,"Kazin in his 1942 assessment of Faulkner's writing as ""incoherent and ungrammatical"" is completely without merit. Any literary scholar with a basic understanding of linguistics can see the importance of Faulkner's writing not only as a genre, but as a launching pad to further understanding of his complex and cherished characters."
4,Still Relevant Today,Cabbagetown is still as relevant today as when it was written in 1950. With the same same econmic and cultural pressures in play today as during the Depression it is well worth the read.
5,Grab a Canadian dictionary,"I really enjoyed this book, but reading it at 23 was a small challenge. I didn't know if it was the author, the time, or the region, but I found there were many words that I just didn't know. Some could be deciphered by reading the sentence or paragraph, others I wrote down and looked up; even that was enjoyable. I had done a research paper on Cabbagetown, but really enjoyed a novel written by someone who lived it and loved it.Wonderful story, cool history, great writing."
2,Obviously a Liberal,"I am upset that I had to give this author money. This book was required for school, and it is biased. Schneider attacks the Bush administration often. This is ridiculous, there should be both sides in a school book."
4,SLOW SHIPPING GOOD OVERALL,USUALLY WHEN I ORDER SOMETHING FROM AMAZON IT TAKES TWO DAYS TO ARRIVE WITH THIS BOOK IT TOOK A LITTLE LONGER THAN EXPECTED I WAS STARTING TO FREAK BUT THEN IT ARRIVED. OVERALL THE BOOK IS IN GOOD CONDITION I WOULD BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN
3,Buy the regular version - unless you like bees,"The product itself is worth 5 stars from an effectiveness point of view - but since it attracts bees like crazy, making it useless outside unless you're a bee farmer, I'll give it three stars.Stick with the regular product until Gunk reformulates this so you don't wind up trying to work on your car while fighting off bees. A few wasps and mud daubers came flying over too."
3,Solid small ensemble arrangements,"These are decent recordings of mostly good performances, but I'm frustrated by the lack of information in the liner notes. The producer, recording engineer, translator, photographer, and some composers are credited. But who actually played the instruments? Anonymous third-worlders, I guess. It seems very disrespectful to the artists not to credit them. The prominently placed Amoco logos in the cover photo had me hoping for the Amoco Renegades, but this certainly doesn't sound like them. Not a bad album, but if you prefer the medium to large ensembles (as I do), you're better off going for some of the Delos recordings."
4,Very good book. Different from most zombie stories.,"I thought this was a very good read. I have just got into this series but cant put the books down. I had my doubts while reading the first book ""autumn,"" because it is slow at first, but once it picks up you really want to know what comes next.The character development is great. You really want to see what happens to the characters you are introduced to. I could really sympathize with them, because of this I give Moody lots of credit as an author.If you like Apocalyptic stories or are a fan of the Zombie genre, the autumn series is for you. Although the pages arent covered with blood this series is sure to prove to be a cult classic."
1,Why does this book have five stars?,"I am embarrassed that I even bought this book. The first one was strangely compelling, and I found the second one on sale cheap, but I should have honestly stopped there.There is nothing really scary about these ""bodies."" They are weak and decaying. A few well-placed molotov cocktails applied regularly would have finished this series at book two (or sooner). Presumably the bodies are not reproducing. Eventually, efforts at getting rid of them would pay off.There is nothing scary about this book, that is, except the hypnotic repetitiveness of the narration. If I read one more time the long, drawn-out explanation of why the bodies were amassing near the survivors, I think perhaps I might have turned into a zombie-like creature myself.I remain flabbergasted that so many people appear to have thought this book was worth 4+ stars."
1,A complete waste of time!,"I just finished the third volume of David Moody's zombie series ""AUTUMN"". I must admit to being somewhat excited after reading the 1st book in the series, but ultimately this entire series was a complete disappoinment. Here's why: Somewhere about 3/4 of the way through the 1st book the author makes the disasterous decision to concentrate his book on character development of his ""still-living"" characters. That is fine, but unfortunately Moody totally abandons his ""bread and butter"" in the book: ZOMBIES! They are completely NON-threatening and really nothing more than topics of conversations for his characters. Can you say: BORING!!!Don't waste your time on this series of books."
3,Humanity's final stand.,"David Moody, Autumn: Purification (Infected Books, 2004)The third entry in Moody's popular Autumn quartet, Purification picks up where The City left off, with the survivors being driven out of the military base by hordes of the (still not flesh-eating!) dead and scrambling to find some place more permanent to make their last stand.Simply by dint of the fact that Moody's not bouncing back and forth between two unrelated storylines, Purification starts off stronger than The City, and the momentum keeps up throughout the book. The undead continue to evolve, which keeps both the survivors and the reader guessing, and the human relationships between the main characters evolve, as they should. (The minor characters are, for the most part, still cardboard cutouts, however.) The ending does put one in mind of another novel whose ghost has shadowed the entire series, but I figured that was going to be the case.Quite enjoyable. ***"
5,the best so far,"I work in a Hastings store in the USA, I was stocking some books one day and as an avid zombie lover, I read the back cover, I decided to come back after work and by the book as I would get a good discount anyway. After it set on my shelf for about a month I decided I wanted to read it, I picked it up and within moments I was hooked! I went back to the store to see if he had any other books out that I might like and to my surprise there was not one but two sequels on the shelf, I bought them up write away! I finished them both in an afternoon! Looking at the back page my heart skipped a beat when I found out there was a fourth book so I instantly got online and found out there were two more!!! But then I discovered I would have to wait for them to release..... the anticipation is going to drive me crazy! I must know what happens next!"
5,Original and difinative rock & roll-Nazareth,"Nazarteh, one of the only few whom is distinct, just hear the music and you know whose singing. Nazareth music is powerful but not with alot of ""noise"". Just plain good music, in other words just let the music do the talking."
4,"Masters from the Vaults - Emerson, Lake & Palmer","If you buy Inside Emerson, Lake & Palmer - 1970-1995: An Independent Critical Review,the 2 disc version with the booklet, Masters From the Vaults is the second disc. You will save some money and get an extra disc and book. It's worth mentioning."
2,"Great Concert, Terrible Print","Take a look at the product artwork on the cover - they've even packaged this in a color that will detract attention from the RED wash that is evident in the still pics & that permeates this footage with virtually all other colors missing.I think this might've even been better in B&W.; They've remastered the the sound, but done nothing with the depessing dark RED picture. Over-priced too."
3,Has anyone compared this to Live Broadcasts DVD?,"As for this ""Masters from the Vaults"" DVD, I have nothing to add to Mr. M. A Maupin's excellent review posted in 2004.But, in 2006, Classic Rock Legends started to release a new series titled ""Live Broadcasts: Collector's Rarities"".Among them there's an ELP DVD, which has the very same set list as this one.I guess they are the same concert but ""Live Broadcasts"" has DTS audio track.If anyone can clarify if they are the same concert, and how different DTS sounds, I'd appreciate. I'm waiting for customer review on that one.And for those who hasn't got ""Masters from the Vaults"" yet, ""Live Broadcasts"" my be a better choise."
4,Standard Handbook of Machine Design,Shigley's Book has been in my personal library since I used it in college.I purchased the new edition for the office since my predecessor did not leave much of a reference library. I find myself using it regularly since there is a wealth of great information between its covers.The transaction was great. The research process was relatively easy with Amazon's website. The order was processed efficiently and the product was received well within the estimated delivery window. It was securely boxed and in great condition.Thanks for a wonderful mail-order experience.
4,Sedaris,"Some of the stories in this book were a bit out of line. For example ""Blood Work"" was when a guy calls the wrong cleaning service, mistaking Sedaris's services for an erotic cleaning service. It is disgusting to even think about this obese sweaty man pleasuring himself in the company of Sedaris. My personal favorite story is ""Six to Eight Black Men"", basically a collection of interesting facts from all the places Sedaris has visited. For some of their traditions he sees no point in them, and recognizes the opportunity to poke fun. If you're looking for a humorous book, then this would be a good buy. It doesn't get too boring, and has a lot of variety since it has 22 different stories. This is a book that you can pick up 3 months after your first read and still laugh out loud at. Although I may have to warn you; the Sedaris family is far from normal."
5,LoL Comedy,"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim was an amazing novel written by David Sedaris. I enjoyed reading this book from cover to cover. The humor was never ending. He took real life stories and told them bluntly with a humor that not many authors can match. The randomness of the novel was what made the novel unique. He talked about the little things in life rather than the big. He told about his family relationships, finding his sexuality, and growing up. The continuous culture shock that is David Sedaris's life was intriguing and hilarious. If you like roll on the floor comedy you will love Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim by David Sedaris.By: Kassie Forman"
5,David and Amy Sedaris- A modern American treasure,"The Sedaris clan have easily transmorgified into the Glass family of the Post-ironic set. Between Amy's raucous television appearances and David's inimitable readings these two are quickly becoming the Franny and Zoe, the Ernie and Dodi, the Kukla and Ollie for the clued-in readers/viewers with a taste for the absurdly hilarious. ANY creation these two produce, either independently or in tandem, is sure to delight. Buy it all: read repeatedly."
4,Sedaris does it again,"Another excellent collection of stories from David Sedaris. Every collection of his reminds me of how funny everyday life can be. Highly recomended for anyone with siblings, travels and has worked a minimum wage job. Enjoy!"
5,Very. Good.,"I've read half of this book and already know that I love it. It bothers me that everyone tries to label David Sedaris as a ""humor writer"" and then come to only expect him to churn out ""humor books."" Sure the books are funny, but a lot of his writing is deeper and serves a more significant purpose than trying to make someone laugh. Also, I like how he is a ""gay writer"" who doesn't just fit into the cookie-cutter by writing ""gay stories."" He branches out...and he loves to explore the psychological implications of situations from his past. Overall, buy this book, and buy Barrell Fever, and expect to laugh, a lot, but don't approach Sedaris's writing as you would, say, Bozo the Clown's work."
2,This is no Me Talk Pretty,"I loved most of Me Talk Pretty One Day, so after reading that, this has been a disappointment. I actually agree with one reviewer that a lot of the stories are ""icky."" Maybe he's running out of subject matter, and so is straining to find humor in some unpleasant and/or bizarre memories. To call Anne Franks' family's hiding place ""adorable""? Oh, please. I think the only LOL essay in the whole collection is ""Six to Eight Black Men."" Sedaris has been very prolific, so maybe he just needs a long break to refill his creative well."
3,Didn't Live Up,"I am one of those serious David Sedaris fans. His other books including Me Talk Pretty One Day and Naked are the type of books that make you laugh out loud on a crowded bus. After anticipating this book for weeks, it was not the constant riot I was expecting. The last chapter was great but other than that I only had one chuckle and a few smiles, which compared to other books is great but compared to other David Sedaris books is a let down. Still a fan though."
1,First stories were great but I wound up wishing I hadn't bought the book.,"Some excellent stories near the beginning of the book, but there was creepy/questionablecontent toward the end of the book that I guess we were supposed to think was funny?I was left wishing I hadn't bought the book and would not buy from this writer again."
3,Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim,I found this book disturbing and am grateful to have listened to my instinct and read it before giving as a gift to a niece.
3,laugh out loud and hide your eyes,"Sedaris is a funny man!! The desription of him and his stories as laugh out loud funny is right on the mark. I would have appreciated a heads up on the graphic nature of some of his tellings, though. I bought two of hese books as gifts...I felt I needed to apologize to the one recipient who received the book before I read it myself...the other one was never given...I was too embarrassed by the the raw sexual nature of several of Sedaris' musings. So be ready to laugh out loud but keep ready, ready to hide your eyes...I would strongly suggest a read through BEFORE you decide to gift this one."
1,porn,I do not read porn. I do not want to read porn. The sample provided was of a lovely book. The book has explicit sexual acts graphically explained. I deleted the book off my kindle.
4,A great escape from regular life - though still closer to your day-to-day than you might think.,"Hilarious book, as expected. Another Sedaris classic filled with short stories that capture your attention."
5,laugh out loud funny,David Sedaris is an absolutely hysterical writer and this book does not disappoint. His stories are always quirky but yet truthful and make me laugh out loud. The only thing better than reading a story he has written is listening to the audio version of it b.c there is just something about his slightly annoying voice that makes the stories sing.
4,Too funny,"I just finished this book and can not wait to get started with the next one. David Sedaris is unique in his stories and will make you laugh, cry, and be a little self-concious. Take this book for a spin. You won't regret it."
3,Not As Funny As the Others,"I read ""Me Talk Pretty On day"" and ""When Engulfed in Flames"" before reading this one. Maybe I was spoiled by the sidesplitting hilarity of the other two. While this one was good, it was not as good as the other two I mentioned. I laughed occasionally, but not the coughing, gagging, stomach cramp inducing laughter of the other two. Worth picking up, but do not expect the same laughs as the other two I mentioned. it also has a different feel than the other two. Slightly more mocking of some of his siblings and yet sometimes I sensed he was giving voice to a heretofore unexpressed love or admiration. Odd. I saw some readers seriously dislike his dad. I bet that is not what he was going for. I could be wrong."
3,Great Listen,"Sedaris is great, as usual. I think he's also a one to two-trick pony and is ever so much more enjoyable on audio than on the printed page."
1,Poor Choice,"Why is this book on a best-sellers list? I had to literally force myself to finish it, and was gravely disappointed. The writing is poor, filled with metaphors that just don't work. The reviews on the back cover also claim that it is ""hilarious""? I'm sure they didn't actually read the book. So for anyone who wants a good autobiographical book, read Augusten Burroughs, Running With Scissors, Dry, and Magical Thinking; David Sedaris doesn't even compare to Burroughs."
3,I did like the book but...,how many autobiographies is david going to write??? It is getting to be pretty repetitive.
1,Too weird,"I guess I expected humor. Instead, it was a downer. I made it thru about a third of the book and gave up."
1,disappointing...,"How very deceiving the other reviews have been! I wonder if the author or his friends posted them. I read them and bought the book thinking it might offer a humorous side on the everyday life of Americans...I was very disappointed. I could not even smile. Grotesque, in some parts ourtight disgusting...miserly low class American life...at its worst. No wonder the author moved to Paris, although I do not doubt that ""the city will always follow him""... If he has read the Greeks, he will know whom I am referring to....Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Hit & Miss,"What's it like for David Sedaris to carry a cup of coffee? You'll find the answer to this question and countless boring others in this labored book. I like Sedaris for his honesty and unique observations, but he reaches a bit with DYFCD. I mean, c'mon, writing about what's it's like to write about your family? He's become too self aware, a tad self-indulgent and actually a little pompous (""Their accents were from Sweden, or maybe Denmark..."" -- Gimme a break.) There are a few fresh touches, especially the latest on his brother."
2,Not good enough,"I like David and have seen him live. The beginning of this book was pretty good, but then I just lost interest. There were the occasional laugh out loud sections, but it seemed like they weren't coming often enough to keep me choosing this book over others. So I say it just wasn't good enough."
5,What? Me funny?,"For self-deprecating laughs and family novelty, read this book. Sedaris is a master at it! You'll find yourself thinking of the funny things that have happened in your life and make comparisons."
3,"Quirky, odd, weird","I don't like to read reviews and descriptions of a book prior to reading it because so very often they give away too much and spoil the book for me. This book was given to me as a gift and I just assumed it was fiction. I kept waiting for some sort of story to evolve, a plot, a direction. Took me many a chapter to even realize this was non-fiction and basically a collection of anecdotes. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the book more if I had realized that at the onset.Anyway, I thought it was a fairly weird grouping of stories. What a bizarre family! While mildly humorous I thought it was mostly weird and quirky (and sad) rather than funny."
5,This book is a truly enjoyable read.,"If you like the dry wit of David Sedaris you will love this book. Even if you don't know who he is, once you have read the first page you will probably love this book.Seeing the world through the author's eyes for a while helps us to remember the little absurdities we experience every day and, somehow, cherish them for a moment rather than let them drive us stark, raving, looney.Thank you Mr. Sedaris, for reminding us to treasure even the stranger moments that make up the life of a human being."
1,Made me feel icky,"I recently bought Sedaris' Carnegie Hall CD and thought it was hilarious. I am also an enthusiastic fan of This American Life and have loved his many contributions. This book proves that NPR highlights Sedaris' best work and leaves the rest. Unfortunately this is a book mostly of ""the rest"".I had a tough time finding any redeeming value in the story of his rickshaw hauling, trash picking sister and her ability to put out cigarettes with her bare feet. I was much more repulsed by the story of his budding homosexuality and the way he was able to coerce young, naked boys to sit on his lap.If I were to choose one word to describe this book it would be ""icky"". Skip the ickiness and buy the CD. Or, better yet skip the expense and listen to This American Life. It's free and it's his best material."
2,Sedaris is better than this.,"I am unequivocally a Sedaris fan, but this book left me wondering if he really has much material left that worthy of being published. The strength of his first 2 or 3 books certainly earned him notoriety and a reputation for tongue-in-cheek prose, but the stories in ""Corduroy"" were simply dull and boring.I certainly can't recommend this book. Get ""Me Talk Pretty.."" or ""Naked""."
2,So disappointed,I had to read this book for a book club and it was very difficult to get through. The story was all over the place and it just didn't have a flow and continuity to it. I enjoy Sedaris' work and was shocked that I had such a hard with this book. Try it for yourself and let's discuss.
3,disappointing,"From such a strong writer, or at least one who had been steadily perfecting his craft, I expected the writing in Denim to be so much better than it is. The stories are often not that funny and often aren't even engaging. If you hadn't seen his previous work you would think he just wasn't capable of better than this, but weirdly, you know he is - or was. Even as a memoir the stories are hardly stories, more anecdotes that often just don't hold together properly. Many feel like sketches of stories that are not yet done. Sedaris has not always been an all hits author but this book, unlike his others, is more misses than hits. I'll still wait to see what his next book entails, but I won't strive to buy it in hardcover again."
3,Chuckle Moments,"I love David Sedaris for the ease at which he can have you in side splitting hysterics. The anticipation of a new collection of essays means at least an hour or two of annoying loved ones and co-workers with, ""one more section to read aloud"".However upon finishing this I only mustered up some hearty chuckles. Success hasn't spoiled Sedaris, it's just stripped him of his anonymity. Consequently placing himself in situations where he can silently observe are becoming obsolete.Most of the stories revolve around his family; a melancholic and unflattering collection of portraits that frankly I felt depressed more than amused. There are some very funny moments, but generally the absurd wit that runs through his previous essays was replaced by a sadder, softer tone. Still, fans of his work will find at least some things to giggle over, and that's more than alot of writers can say."
4,Dressed for Success,"I've been anticipating this book after buying the Live at Carnegie Hall CD, as he previewed some works from this new book.Overall the stories still have the same tone and subject matter of his previous work. Some parts were laugh out loud funny, but not as much as Me Talk Pretty One Day. It's funnier at least for me to hear him read it out loud than it is to read the book. His voice lends a lot of expression into the pieces than just his words can. If you can get the books on tape or CD, I recommend that out of personal bias, but DS in any media is well worth it."
3,"Good stuff, but much is rehashed from previous works","All in all, this is excellent material - highly entertaining, a bit edgy, and sometimes dark while maintaining a sense of humor. My only issue is that once you have read some of Sedaris' work, it can be difficult to find fresh new stuff. I'm not certain if the stories in Corduroy and Denim are exact replicas of those released in his previous books, but they sure seem very familiar. If you have read ""Naked,"" ""Me Talk Pretty One Day,"" and ""Holidays on Ice,"" save yourself some money and just borrow this one from the library. If you are new to Sedaris, by all means, get this book, his work is not to be skipped."
4,Something more serious,"If you enjoyed ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" then you will like this book. Although it is a little more serious... with personal stories from Sedars' struggles in life. But it still has laugh out loud situations.I listened to both books, read by the author, which made the stories feel even more personal."
2,I Was Afraid This Might Happen....(2.5 stars),"From great anticipation comes greater disappointment. I don't even think that Sedaris was trying to pull together another set of unbearably funny stories. The settings and characters are certainly familiar, but here they are morbid, tepid, and even a bit contrived. His snaggletoothed humor is almost entirely absent; I didn't even crack a smile. In fact, I found myself cringing a few times. Oy.Will I unhesitatingly read David Sedaris again? Absolutely. I just won't suffer from the wait this time."
2,I'm getting sleepy. . . very sleepy.,Me Talk Pretty One Day was much more interesting. This was a little dry and drawn out. Had to retire it halfway through do to boredom.
2,Depressing instead of funny,"A huge fan has been let down. I found most of the stories sad - pathetic - depressing - and kept getting the creeping feeling that Mr. Sedaris is mining for gold in a place where all the nuggets have already been removed. One HUGE laugh in the chapter about snow in the Carolinas (his name for muddy snowmen); the chapter on his brother's wedding was also hilarious. The rest were odd, creepy, and left me feeling somewhat dirty."
5,Who ever gave this less than 5 stars is an idiot,"I quote this book more than I quote seinfield. I have become addicted to it, to David's twisted use of the English language. I have read all of his other books, and I highly recommend his cds."
1,A literary reality show?,Sedaris' book is entirely too self-aggrandizing to rate as entertainment. Spare yourself from the temptation to buy.Lamar Nesbit
2,only got half way thru...,"...but couldn't bear to read another word. I've neverread any other Sedaris work, and was a bit disapointedby this book. Too much talk about his sexuality for itto be funny (unless he's trying to use his sexuality ashumor; are we supposed to think the fact that he's gayis funny?? I think not).I left my copy in a hotel room, perhaps the maidthere will see the humor in David's cleaning servicestory - I sure didn't (utterly gross!)I will try Me Talk Pretty...since most people herespeak highly of it. I have heard from other folksthis guy is hilarious...that remains to be seen."
1,Random rantings from a drugged homosexual,"The wittiest parts are in the first 3 chapters. Other than that, don't bother. This is the sad story of the product of a dysfunctional, estranged family who has many opportunities through gifts, trusts and other money sources to find his potential, get an education and make his contribution to society. Instead, through drugs, homosexuality and extreme self-absorbtion, he descends into a sad, wasted life. I regret buying this book. Again, don't bother."
3,Not so bad - not so great.,The book arrived with a slip jacket that looked dirty and there was a slit on the spine of it - it looked as though it had been cut with an exacto knife. Other than that it was in good condition.
3,Dress me disapointed,"I absolutely teared up in amusement while reading, and re-reading Sedaris' ""Me talk Pretty One Day"" and highly anticipated DYFIC&D, however it did not live up to his previous work. Worth a read, but not nearly as entertaining. But gosh-darnit do I love The Rooster!"
4,"SEDARIS, AN IMPRESSIVE STORY TELLER","David Sedaris, playwright and NPR commentator, returns with another collection of short stories for grownups. Sedaris creates childhood scenes of rebellion, love, misunderstanding, and more among families and friends. Through description, witty dialogue, and dry humor, the author reveals a distinctive view of growing up in middle class America. Some may consider it a literary version of TV's ""Malcom in the Middle"" -- childhood dilemmas and a child's lucid observations about immature grownups.Three stories stand out to me. In ""Let it Snow,"" a mom locks the rowdy kids out during a snow day. ""The Ship Shape"" shows kids watching the promise of a summer home shrink day by day. And the dad in ""Full House"" forces his son to join a slumber party, and the son realizes just how different he really is from the neighborhood jocks.David Sedaris reads the audio version of his book. The added inflections, especially those of the mother, are priceless."
1,This book is disappointing,"I had my idependent bookstore rush an order of Dress Your Family. I couldn't wait until I got a copy..NOW, I wish I had waited. It simply doesn't pack the punch of David's other books. Its routine. Its been done before. David is in danger of taking advantage of his many readers. He is clearly talented, but this book simply doesn't take chances. I know he can do better than this."
2,also disappointed,"Received the book as a gift from my mother. I echo the concerns of other disappointed readers. Only ""6 to 8 Black Men"" made me laugh out loud. He paints his family in an unusually unflattering light - I grew weary of reading about how much coffee and wine his mother drank. The story about Anne Frank's apartment seemed out of place.Still, I recognize and respect what went into the book, and, like another reviewer, find it provocative. I'm not willing to abandon Sedaris based on one book. And I hope to experience the audio version."
3,Good read,"This book was a good read. At times I was bored with the writer, but over all it was a great book!"
2,"Interesting, depressing, sometimes funny","I am open minded enough to see where some people would enjoy this. I'm a fan of dark comedy, but I need a little more kindness and a little less indifference and a little more depth and humanity than the Sedaris family exhibits. Fans of the movies ""Happiness""and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse,"" would probably enjoy Sedaris. I find him interesting, but depressing. I did laugh hysterically at the 6-8 black men story. That was a big relief after the selfish, sad lives I kept reading about before that story came up about 2/3 of the way into the book."
2,What a disappointment.,"Rehash. A few fun moments, but we've been here before. I wish Sedaris would apply his wit to new material. This just seems like a scheme by publishers to squeeze a few more dollars out of a very profitable franchise. Damn shame. We fans deserved better."
4,"Delivers the familiar punches, but somehow less so","David Sedaris is no doubt one of the more enjoyable writers out there today, even if this book is more or less a continuation of his past works. The fourth time around (or is it fifth?) it just doesn't seem as fresh and sharp witted. But I'll still take this book over Dan Brown's anyday."
5,The Best Yet,"This was Sedaris's best book by far, which is saying a lot since his other ones were great too. I laughed out loud at least every few pages. One story even made me misty-eyed. I haven't enjoyed a book this much for a long time."
2,Not what I expected,"I was under the impression from just about every review of this book, that it was humorous in many ways, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I was WAY off. Its not funny at all, and its more like an autobiography of the difficulties the author had growing up as a homosexual. There were few instances where I could even chuckle at the writting and although I will admit the author has some talent, the book should not be marketed as a funny bunch of essays, it is a straightforward, somewhat depressing, look at a difficult life."
3,listen than read,"there's a matter of delivery. when i read mr. sedaris' writing, i can't help myself feeling that i'm missing a certain essence of the story. when i listen to him read, i get the 3-D stereo surround effect. he's a wicked writer, love the book as i loved other books of his, but it's just that he's a whole lot better when he reads. and he's even 100 miles better when he's on live, when you get the full effect of the interaction. he's one very rare author that i rather listen on CD than read, funny that, ain't it?"
2,a huge disappointment to this fan,I have waited anxiously for any new work from this usually-hilarious author and made the mistake of buying his newest book as soon as it came out. It seems Mr. Sedaris may be going through a midlife crisis as the majority of the stories were very introspective and not at all funny. I was left with a feeling of sadness instead of the usual uplifting I recieve from the view of his unusual family and love lives. I would NOT recommend this to anyone looking for an amusement.
3,Funny Book,I really enjoyed this book. I laughed out loud several times while reading it. David's brother is at hoot! If your looking for a few laughs this is a good one.
1,stop smoking and get to work,"I am a huge Sedaris fan but was very disappointed in this book. First off, as a fan, I had already read half the stories put together here in magazines. Secondly, they just aren't as funny as his earlier works. Sedaris needs to broaden his horizons or if he insists on sticking to the same subjects over and over, work harder to make the stories funny. It's sad when you see great writers getting lazy."
2,Nothing new here!,"I am a HUGE Sedaris fan. Can say he is my favorite author. Have paid to see him speak any chance I can get. This book disappointed me. Not as funny as the others and the only ""laugh out loud"" moments I had were reading the two chapters I had already read. ""The Ship Shape"" I heard him read over a year ago in Redwood City, CA, and another chapter - Paul's wedding chapter - I had also read somewhere but can't remember where. I was very disappointed. Looks like he's lost his touch."
3,Not his best but good enough,"I enjoyed ""Dress Your Family..."". It delves more into his family and personal relationships than the others have and while funny - it is occasionally funny in a disturbing way. You can't help but wonder how much is true and how much is sort of maybe true but somewhat embellished. You find yourself hoping there is in fact embellishment because we're talking serious dysfunction otherwise - particularly when he discusses one of his sisters and his brother.His writing is as usual quick and biting and witty. He is self-deprecating, but compared to a couple of his siblings, and maybe his father (as he describes them) - he is the *less messed up*, which is scary.Although I didn't like it as much as ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"", I still recommend it."
5,An excellent read,"Another excellent book by David Sedaris. I couldn't put it down until I finished. Anyone who truly understands his humor could in no way be dissapointed by this book. The hilarious stories of his family give you a more personal look into his life. While the stories are amusing, at the same time you're able to see how much he truly cares for his family--despite all their visible flaws. The humor in his writing is matched by few. Definitely an enjoyable read."
4,Master of the Genre,"I'm a fan of David Sedaris and an avid reader of this genre--collections of essays. While I agree with many reviewers that this book is not his ""funniest,"" it does provide some laughs since humor is embedded in his writing style and view of the world. I don't believe that each piece; however, is meant to be funny and as a result, it is rich on many levels and, I feel, a worthwhile collection.Sedaris reveals so many intimate details about his family members, it left me wondering if he had their blessings?!""Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim,"" by the way, was no where near as disturbing to me as Augusten Buurroughs' ""Running With Scissors."" But I understand how one cannot help compare the two.If you haven't already, please read ""Me Talk Pretty One Day."" It's one of the funniest books I've ever read.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."
4,Hilarity Revisited,"David Sedaris will never cease to amaze me. Whether he's using his wit to embarrass one of any of his many sisters or to describe drowning vermin, ""Dress Your Family in Cordouroy and Denim"" is beyond funny. When it's 4 a.m. and you look up at the clock unaware of anything but your throat hurting from laughing out loud, you know you have been entertained by a master. If you read ""Esquire"" have heard or have seen ""Live at Carnegie Hall"" some of the material may seem repititious, so be forewarned that he refers to himself as ""the laziest man in showbiz."""
2,too boring:a bit like watching a family vacation slide show,"of people you might not even find so intersting. Maybe I just overdosed on his family stories in the much funnier first two books. I feel his well has run dry. I would classify Sedaris as a writer of Books for people who dont really like reading...Or only like easy stuff but are too hip or think they are too hip to read Bridget Jones type of books. Even Alain de Botton is much more creative..Time would be better and more satisfingly spent by reading Julian Barnes, Michael Cunningham, Anne Tyler, Jane Smiley, and Chekhov's, John Cheever's or John Updikes stories."
4,Fashion Forward,"David Sedaris puts things in writing that aren't discussed in polite company but ring true to everyone. And sometimes he tells polite, but amusing tales too. What insight."
3,Somewhat amusing,"This was the first title I have read from the author and after seeing all of the reviews, I somewhat expected this to be one of the those laugh out loud books. With a few exceptions, it wasn't. I was still entertained by the accounts of this very unique family and was able to relate to various pieces of the different stories. I dont regret picking up this book up but I I think I was expecting more."
3,Moderately amusing,"This is the first book I've read by the author after many recommendations from people. The book was so-so...the only time I laughed out loud was in the ""Girl Next Door"" when he finds out the little girl's hick grandmother is nicknamed ""Rascal."" That was brilliant. The reason the stories lacked a lot of humor for me is because they were so banal and commonplace. This guy does not have a unique family--everyone I know has a family just as crazy, but in different ways. My family is twice as nutty as his, though nobody drinks. I just didn't feel like this guy had any experiences worth writing about. As another reviewer pointed out, the book read like some random dude's mildly amusing, though ultimately pointless, blog."
3,Sedaris' Evolution,"The newest release by Sedaris failed to make me laugh as hard as his other titles. In Dress Your Family, he tackles personal issues relating to his family. I appreciated the courage this took, and within the pages I felt that he carried a bit of guilt for turning the lives of his brothers, sisters, and parents into something as public as a book. As I moved through the book, it read at a very monotone level. Rarely did a surprise catch me off guard, but there were moments when I cackled from a silly situation.Sedaris' writing and style is evolving, and some may say maturing. Here with Dress Your Family, I believe we're witnessing a turning point. I'm very curious to see what he delivers next."
2,maybe I expected too much....,"Let me start out by saying David Sedaris is one of my favourite writers. I had been anticipating this new book for quite some time, and sadly to say, I was terribly disappointed. Previous efforts ('Naked', 'Me Talk Pretty..' et al) have caused me to laugh out loud in inappropriate places. Often. Even on repeated readings. With the exception of ""six to eight black men"" (about christmas in another country) which is very funny, the most I could muster was a smile for about half the essays. Several stories were downright unappealing, Especially ""chicken in the henhouse"" and ""the girl next door"". Both had an underlying theme relating to fear of being accused of pedophila. Both left me feeling kind of creepy. If this was a first effort, perhaps I would be more forgiving. All in all it's not a bad book. I just expected better. I'm still a fan, for now...."
1,pretentious garbage,"i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages. i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign. i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something. the impression i instantly got was ""BEEP BEEP! PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY."" guess what, mr. sedaris? i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood. millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card. check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style."
2,meh.,"I didn't find this book too interesting. It felt like I was reading a random stranger's blog. If that's the type of thing you enjoy, then read *real* blogs - they're free. It's hard to connect with Sedaris, even after reading the short stories."
2,Not Your Usual David Sedaris,"Clearly, he is out of material. The essays in this book can be only a few pages long; that would be forgivable if they were funny. He's lost his edge, I guess. Maybe he should've waited a little longer before he came out with this one. However, all his other books so far are hysterical - especially Holidays on Ice."
2,It's bland and offensive,"I despised the essay/story called ""Possession"" and felt that Sedaris has dropped to a disgraceful level of insensitivity. I can't find anything even remotely humorous about the Holocaust. I'm not at all saying he thinks the Holocaust is funny but I don't joke about it like I don't joke about slavery, wars or other examples of man's ability to become sadisic monsters. Who knows, maybe Anne Frank finds it funny from somewhere beyond the grave but I can't. I, too, have been to Anne's secret annex in Amsterdam. It was a place to mourn and a reminder to not be hateful in our own lives. I loved ""me talk pretty"" and even liked the quirky, selfish character he portrays himself to be but the stories in this book are bland and that single story made me feel immensely sad."
4,An amusing summer read,"This book is hilarious in a ""Wonder Years"", ""Malcolm in the Middle"", ""That 70's Show"" sort of way. Some reviews have called it ""predictable"", etc., blah, blah. but the reviewers are the same people who would slog through a 1,000 page boring piece of crap just to prove they're smarter than us when they're not. The book's one flaw is the author's constant harping on his gayness. Except for it's relevance to growing up in 1960's North Carolina, it's a tired theme that the book doesn't need to be funny."
3,So so,"This installment of the Sedaris family saga is not nearly as good as ""Naked"" or ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"", which are both absolutely brilliant. The book has its moments, but some of the essays are actually dull. And the ones involving his disgusting (sorry, David) brother Paul are simply gross. Some of the graphic descriptions and language go a bit overboard."
2,He thinks he's funnier than he is,"I used to wonder what all the hype was about. Now I know. Not much. David Sedaris has had a not atypical suburban kid life - he grew up alienated from his parents and family, he went to college and didn't do as well as he might have hoped, he started using and then recreationally selling drugs, he cleaned up his act, and he moved on to bigger things. He's got family members with quirks, and he's gay. And he tells you about them.Before you get this book or any of his others, go get David Rakoff's Fraud. I think Rakoff is superior to Sedaris here - Rakoff is a journalist so his subject matter is intrinsically interesting. Sedaris, if you don't want to hear about his family, or you think he just sounds whiny, you're out of luck. I wasn't bored out of my mind so 2 stars seems appropriate, but that's still 5 hours of my life I'm never getting back."
4,"Funny, but not quite hilarious","I've never read anything by David Sedaris, but this book was getting a huge amount of play on tv (saw him on David Letterman last night!) and in a lot of magazines. So I bought the book and I wasn't disappointed. The stories of his childhood and life are very funny and brought back memories of my own experiences growing up in the burbs (though my life had nothing on his!). I guess I just expected hilarity due to all the exposure he has been getting. Give it a few hours and it will give you a few laughs."
3,Funny yet,"Sedaris's newest collection, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, is an odd mix of tales from a witty personality. The most humorous of this selection are the stories where he describes events from his youth. The main source of the hiliarity comes from his ability to create and to tell of scenarioswhich the reader can relate to their own life. He tells of picking on the youngest sibling in order to get revenge against an angry mother during a snow day. This is just one example of his tales.One major downfall of this collection is his later stories seem to drag on and carry no true point. They lack the wit and character of that makes Sedaris such a loveable author. Also, some of his commentary on his own thoughts and sexuality leave the reader feeling that he may be dealing with some deep insecurities. Yet, all in all, it is a good collection of stories to keep around the house and read in small doses."
5,Only Sedaris...,"Only Sedaris could come up with some of this stuff. While I wouldn't say this is his best yet, they're all awfully close to each other and all awfully great reads."
3,Worth Reading,"This was my first Sedaris book. I didn't quite know what to make of it when I started reading it, but it grew on me. Sedaris has to grow on you. His books seem to be a compilation of short stories about his life...a strange life. Anything he writes is entertaining and he's a comfortable, easy-to-read writer. Recommend."
5,Lovin' Sedaris,"This was the first David Sedaris book I ever read. After reading this book I bought and read three other books of his. This one has turned out to be my most favorite. Once you start reading you won't want to put down. Sedaris will have you laughing over and over again with his bizarre and intriguing memoir. If you read only one Sedaris book ever, choose Corduroy and Denim."
5,Different... very readable.,"I'm a huge fan of The Truth Machine and The First Immortal, and this book was unlike Halperin's novels in some ways. For one thing, I don't think he rewrote it as many times. It's much less intricate and maybe not as polished, yet he displays the same ability to put you right into an imaginary situation and convey an astonishingly logical, believable future. The three stories present a benign, moderate, and terrible outcome of the Y2K bug (not necessarily in that order). My only complaint is that they were too short -- I finished this book in three hours, and it felt more like 30 minutes. Anyway, it's very easy to read, and now I really think I have a more balanced view of the risks of the Millennium Bug. Maybe I'll read it again tonight to see if I missed anything. And even though I'm not as scared of Y2K as I was before I read the book, I'll probably still stock up on bottled water and canned goods, and maybe buy a few gold coins and a generator, too, just in case..."
4,Not really 10 inches...,"Just received this today, and am mildly disappointed to find that it measures 9 1/2 inches across, not 10 inches as the box says. I had been hoping to use the heavy glass lid from my old 10 inch pan, but obviously can't. Also, the metal lid that comes with this pan does not seem to be really tight fitting - the lid isn't heavy enough to really press down and there's a bit of play - not close to a press fit & will probably let steam escape readily. Not enough reason to send this back at this price, but annoying misrepresentation. On the plus side, really nice finishing & well made."
4,New design,"When the handle wore out on my trusty old Farberware skillet, I ordered a new one here and was disappointed to find the pan is a little smaller and heavier than my old 10-inch pan and has straighter, taller sides. The lid is lighter, however, so it evens out. I thought the old style pan with slightly-slanted sides was easier for stirring, but I will probably get used to the new shape.Just be aware that this current design is not quite the same as the old Farberware you may have used and loved for years. However, it is definitely a durable and nice-looking pan for the price."
2,Not 10 Inches - Like They Say,"I owned a Farberware 10"" skillet already. It was made years ago and I needed to replace it because of a loose handle that constantly needed tightening. I was very happy to find this product on the internet, with a lid. I could not find a 10"" skillet with a lid in any store.After my husband opened this present for Christmas, he said it was smaller than our older skillet. I asked, ""How could that be? I ordered a 10 "" skillet?""We took out the tape measure. This skillet is a full 1/2"" less in diameter than our older Farberware 10"" skillet. I guess you cannot trust what is written on the box? Farberware must not care that their quality control (as the merchandise is made overseas), is non-existant?I gave it two stars because I do not like deceptive advertising of a product. It seems well made, but it is NOT 10"".I've lost faith in what is claimed on packaging. Bummer. I'll probably let Farberware know what I think."
4,"Great, but handle fell off!","I've had this particular frying pan for about 9 years or so. It's been great, I like it a lot, but all of a sudden the screw that keeps the handle on keeps falling out and it's very difficult to fix, and I'm probably going to have to get a new one. Otherwise, it's been great. I like the fact that I can scour it with an SOS pad if I have to, and not worry if I'm damaging it, (like All-Clad), and the lid fits tightly. I've made many a dish in this frying pan, I'm just sorry the handle went on me."
3,Bottom of pan rough,"The Farberware quality is great, and I ordered this set as a replacement. The only problem I encountered is that the bottom of the pan is very rough. We'd just purchased a ceramic cooktop, so we'll have to smooth it out somehow. I'd purchased a large boxed set of Farberware recently, and the frying pan in that set was fine."
5,Always reliable.,"This pan is perfect. It's large, holds a lot of food and cooks evenly after the pan is warmed up. It's easy to clean, comes with it's own lid, which is always desirable, and it's attractive. To add to this review: I've had this pan for four years now and still love it. However, I was in a kitchen store recently and looked at the Farberware collection and found that the quality had gone down, way down. So those purchased some time ago will find a sturdy pan, but the products coming out of Farberware now (as of May 2011) are low quality and not as durable."
4,Farberware Fry Pan,"It is wonderful to have tracked down this ""old style"" Farberware. I bought this as a gift for someone who needed to replace hers from the 70's. Seems that they hold up pretty well. Nothing fancy, just a basic, sturdy and favorite line of cookware."
2,Beware when used in oven!!,"The frypan as a frypan was an excellent piece of cookware, but even though I never put it in an oven over 300 degrees, the handle on mine broke in half when I lifted it out of the oven full of food."
2,"Why oh why don't you change, post -rock?","I purchased this album because a Wire Tapper compilation presented me with 'Flares' pt 3 or so, the ONLY stand out track on the whole album. I was expecting some complex sequencing, a little glitch core with drawn out guitars, with perhaps a somber or delicate mood. What I got was one original song surrounded by very poor reduxes of Explosions in the Sky, who also sound like poor reduxes of other bands, who sound like other bands etc. Sorry, but the melodies on this album are already outdated, as much as I appreciate the production value here [it does SOUND great], this album bored me with its seeming complexity once it was revealed to be startlingly simplistic."
4,multiplying board good,Nice little toy to get kids interested in math. Alot more fun than flash cards!
3,Yep it really is dim,"Hmmm, I read the reviews and bought it anyway, it's not a great as I remember. I could have printed off a study grid for my daughter and it would have been as if not more effective. it is VERY hard to see the answers."
1,Have to return it.,"It is poorly designed. The answer is not clear to see when the button is pushed. Even you can read the answer, it can be easily hidden by the finger. The question (A x B) are painted on top of the button, and it can be easily worn out. I can't believe a product of such a poor design can be put for sale. It is already 2011! I have to return it."
2,Not what I was expecting,"We have an addition version of this game that we like much better.Pros: it does provide good practice.Cons: it only goes up to 9.The answers are shown through the transparent button when you hold it down, but you can't ""click"" them in place.Because the buttons don't lock in place, it the feel of the buttons is a little cheap."
2,Multiplying,I bought this thinking it would be great way to teach kids their multiplication but it isn't the case. When you press down on the buttons you can hardly see the answers. I remember them being a lot brighter. Very disappointed.
3,Could improve.,Same as with the Pluses and Minuses tablet. The answers are difficult to see when you press the buttons. Would still recommend.
3,It ok,"I had one of these growin up an it helped me a lot, but this one is not easy to read the answer... They just don't make thing the way they use to."
2,Answers are unreadable,"I was very disappointed in this toy. I had something like this as a child, but I found that the answers were unreadable on this product. The answers were off center so the numbers appeared behind the equation. Also, they were difficult to read because the plastic was almost TOO opaque. Really, I wish I could get my money back for this, but the return process is a pain when I'm so busy already.I gave this product two stars because although the execution was terrible, the over all durability of the product was good."
1,Bad design..Don't buy it,Very poor design..The results are difficult to read as the box is semi transparent. The worst thing is the results are superimposed on the print. I forgot to read the comment before buying this. So had to return this back to Amazon for a refund.
5,"Easy to follow, step-by-step instructions for young people","Written and illustrated by Michelle Eva Portman, Compost By Gosh! is a simple, rhyming children's book about the joy of making compost - the process of letting worms eat leftover food and turn into that material into something which is perfect for fertilizing plants. Easy to follow, step-by-step instructions for young people who want to make their own compost (under adult supervision) round out this excellent and very highly recommended instructional book for budding young gardeners."
5,Vermicomposting made fun for children,As an environmental stewardship educator I use this book all the time when teaching preschool - 4th graders. The rythming text & quality illustrations works well with the early elementary audience. The rich vocabulary and detailed explaintions appeal to the upper elementary student.
5,Great Book!,"Compost, By Gosh is a wonderful read-aloud book for young learners. As an informal educator with a non-profit organization, I need read-aloud books that get across environmental messages in an entertaining way. Because the story rhymes, it's easy to get into that read-aloud groove. This is my go-to book on vermiculture (worm composting) - students love the story and illustrations. Excellent resource for a library or teacher and just a fun read for kids."
1,It didn't help my vision,"I followed this book and did everything it said with an open mind. The print is every bit as blurry as it every was before I tried the things in this book. I wanted so much for this to work, and I'll try again, but after four months of daily applying the techiniques of this book, my vision did not improve the least bit."
3,Ok,"I am halfway through this book. You definitely make yourself more relaxed and reduce the strain BUT for me personally its too many directions and I like things more focused. The point that I do not like about author is that she keeps recommending one or the other book throughout. Its irritating for me. Just put a Suggested reading at the end. Don't advertise through books. (I would suggest read ""Relearning to see"" A fat book BUT very focused and to the point and no advertising in text.Have read it and am switching back to it...) Hope this helps!"
3,not really oil rubbed,"It fits and does the job.I have a night light with the identical pattern and was looking for a matching vent cover. The description was ideal BUT it's not really ""oil rubbed"" It's more of a matt black which I could have picked up locally"
5,a Jewel,"I have owned this book for years. I've read it six times. End up with tears in my eyes every time when the King and the Primate look back over their lives together, fighting for the freedom of their beloved country.A HUGE story that will totally engulf you in the lives of the characters. If my house were burning down, I would return to rescue this one!!"
4,Enjoyable Tales,"With my interest in Scottish history, I found this story a good way to learn more about the Scottish Wars of Independence. While it may not be historically accurate, it is a stirring tale of the difficult journey of Bruce to the high kingship over Scotland."
4,Other Books,"The Bruce is acknowledged as King of Scotland, but now he has all the problems of a ruler, as opposed to a rebel, and must also try and deal with King Edward, in England, and be formally recognised as a king, himself."
5,Excellent quality and value,"I bought this in my Gold Box values because I own other Farberware products. This particular pan is not only up to the quality of what I own, but I think better."
3,Adequate at best,"Had the pan a while, then it melted down on the stove. Whereas I still have an older version of the same pan from the same manufacturer that I inherited from my mom. Its seen years of use, then the same treatment as this newer one, and yet it is still functional if not pretty. They just don't make em like they used to."
4,Farberware Saucepan - Trial and Error make perfect use,"I purchased this saucepan so that I can start making homemade marshmallows, hot fudge sauce, and caramel sauce. This pan heats up evenly, but for reassurance, work on a series of trial and error to familiarize with use, how fast it really takes to caramelize sugar in this pan and how fast it is to reach the hard crack sugar mixture stage. All in all, it is a great buy!"
4,Hooray! I have a rice pot again!,"When my 50 year old two-quart aluminum pot finally gave up the ghost, my present cookware just wouldn't make decent rice like that old pot would; it would burn, stick to the pan, just awful - I think it's because the lids weren't tight enough. I looked around on Amazon and picked out a pot that looked like it had a decent lid. The saucepan arrived in all its shining glory, and the next time I went to make rice, I gave it a try. It made lovely rice, and then again a second time. So, I'm very happy that I now have a decent pot to make my rice in. She'll be pressed into service again this week."
5,Daughter in Law Loved It,My DIL loved receiving this as part of her Christmas gifts. I have had Farberware for 46 years and it looks as good today as it did all those years ago.
2,stainless steal,I tought that even though they were stainless steal the the color was darker than silver.I was a little disappointed
1,Terrible disappointment Farberware Classic 2-Quart Saucepan,"This pan leaks dark soot like material from beneath the upper lip of the pan every time I use it. Even worse, the seal between the pan proper and its bottom is evidently not sealed because other stuff leaks out of it, going upward on the pan; it is very difficult to even clean it off; consequently, I used this pan a few times and now it just sits unused, making me think I may never buy another Farberware -- despite the fact that my previous pan similar to this one lasted through 56 years of marriage. Yes, it was a wedding present and used several times a week."
5,Sanuk Sandal 5 STAR!,"The Sanuk Sandal is so comfortable! The description of the sandal, size, color and comfort was right on the mark. The sole of this sandal has a slight sponge however does not leave permanent foot marks. The fringe fabric strap between the toes is very comfortable and the sole on the bottom is constructed to conform to the bend of the foot when walking. Unlike some sandals which are bulky the Sanuk conforms to the foot and is true to size. It fringe is suttle and the colors are faded. As a surfer, this is one of the best kick back sandals I have ever own! I highly recommend this sandal. I purchased 2 pair just incase someone removes their shoes and borrows mine!!!!"
5,These little boots are awesome,"I got these for my grandson. They are the cutest ever, so soft and so flexible, great for just starting to walk .... the lining is so soft and cozy. I highly recommend this item!"
4,Cute but sizes run really big,"The Ugg Baby Erin Booties are really cute but the sizes run really big; I ordered a second pair, size small, for my 8 month old and there's still room to grow. I'll keep the mediums for next year ... they really are that big, but the quality of the boots are excellent! And oh-so-cute!"
4,Great shoes for toddlers!,"My 21 month old twins LOVE their new boots. They bring them to me to put them on them all the time. THey have wide feet and they have no problem getting into these. They walk great in them and don't need socks. The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is the soft bottom. If they had the hard bottom they would get more outdoor use, but with the soft bottom they can only walk to and from the car. They also look ADORABLE. At $39 a pair they were worth every penny."
4,"Good products, can dirty easily.","This is a good and really *soft* flip flops, I use it often on a daily basis. but this gets dirty and I need to find out the washing instructions."
5,Tenchi Muyo is the anime for the best J-Pop music!,"Another great Tenchi CD, and I wasn't surprised that it would be. I'm glad to have both the english and japanese versions of Washu's Lullaby and the opening theme to the Mihoshi Special. Just as good as volume 1, if not better."
2,Surprised How Uncomfortable for a Nine West Shoe,"I ordered these a 1/2 size larger then normal, and I needed a larger shoe. I love Nine West shoes 'cause they are usually soooooo comfortable, no matter the height. Not the case with this shoe. Surprisingly uncomfortable. sent back."
3,"Good stuff, not the best however...","I've read a lot of comic books about 11th September, like Heroes and 9-11 and though not appreciating all of them, It seemed that they all did the work they were wrote for: remembering the heroes of 11th september. That's all, this book has the same function and does it quite well, although there are not as famous artists as the ones in the other comic books. Recommended!"
3,Modern Day Stephen Foster ?,"As on ""Silver & Gold"", Young seems focused on creating songs that could become part of the American consciousness. ""Prairie Wind"", while a worthwile collection of songs, seems to be built around the masterful ""When God Made Me"". One of Young's greatest songs ""When God Made Me"" seems to be a companion piece to John Lennon's ""Imagine"". It's no coincidence that Young performed ""Imagine"" at the 9-11 benefit. What is interesting about ""When God Made Me"" concerns Young's belief in God. Various past quotes from David Crosby indicated that Young typically had an ""Anti-God"" or atheist stance. While creating a song with all the necessary ""sounds"" of a hymn (a choir, plaintive piano) Young ultimately delivers a powerful and thoughtful piece of music that not only questions God's existence, but his existence as well."
2,Makes Silver and Gold sound like Black Sabbath,"Bummer.Am I the first one to point out that ""No Wonder"" mercilessly steals the melody from ""World on a String?""Anyway, I'm doing what I did with Broken Arrow, Are You Passionate, Landing on Water, and Mirror Ball - teaching myself to like this album. Beacuse it's Neil, you know. And he's the king. And part of being a fan of Neil's is getting burned. But this is some third degree stuff here. Tepid, lifeless, by the numbers. Neil has never sounded so 'phoned in.' Auto-pilot. Take your pick from any of the rock crit cliches - this is grim.That said, aside from the production, some songs are quite nice the seventh time through.I guess it's working."
4,Amazing Live!!!!!!,"I heard ""It's a Dream"" and ""He was the King"" on Saturday Night Live. Canadians have SO much to be proud of in their musicians with people like Neil Young coming from this great country"
4,Good Stuff!!,"If you are a long time Neal Young fan, Prairie Wind is a very cool breeze. Many of the cuts will bring back memories of Harvest and Harvest Moon. Not my favorite NY recording but certainly worth having in your collection."
5,Awesome!,I totally love this CD and watched the entire DVD last night....AWESOME!!!! Hios best record in years if not ever as far as i am concerned.
3,Familiar but awkward,"Fans of Harvest and that country rock genre of Neil Young's will hear that familiar style in Prairie Wind, but this new album lacks something important lyrically. The words just don't seem to have been written with the tunes in mind. They're plastered over the music carelessly, compromising the beauty of the tunes. Maybe he thought the words themselves were more important than how they mesh with the music to form the whole song; fair enough, but it doesn't make for great music. If you like Neil's beautiful country rock, I highly recommend Harvest, Harvest Moon, and After the Goldrush instead."
1,Typical Neil,"I love most Neil Young but every fan knows that about one in three of his albums really sucks. After Greendale and Greatest hits, I'm very disapointed."
1,Buy Neil's Greatest Hits Insted,"I don't think this is Neil Young's best CD. I look at the radiobut the Painter gets played like 2,695 times on the radio a day.Why? Plus I've heard the songs are too slow. This is too muchof an overrated CD! Buy the last album from Neil Young, GreatestHits it has better songs like his best, Down by the River, andthe great grunge, Hey Hey, My My. This is a waste of money."
1,ENUFF,"I am not a Neil Young fan at all. I heard the song 'The Painter' on Q104.3 the other day. The DJ Maria Millito was raving about this song before she played it. I almost drove off the road. Sounded like a cat, who got his tail caught in a closing door... PLEASE Neil, put the guitar & microphone away and go a rocking on your porch...."
4,Prairie Wind by Neil Young,"Of course it's Neil Young after all. Great music to just sit back and enjoy. I would recommend ""Prairie Wind"" to friends & family."
5,A Captivating Experience,"I bought Neil Young's 33 1/3 album, 'After the Gold Rush,' in April 1972. Until April 2006, I had had no further contact with his music. At that time, I just by chance chose to see the documentary, 'Heart of Gold,' at a movie theater in Knoxville. It was a captivating experience. I felt I had been lifted into the presence of honest, powerful art and pure poetry. I buy few DVD's and own few; this was one I had to have. Now I am in danger of over-playing it and wearing the edge off my enthusiasm."
2,More elevator music...,"Two or three good songs, the rest are filler. Reminds me of Silver and Gold and a few other recent releases that some people think are ""Timeless Classics"". Greendale was the only worthwhile project from Neil in the last 10 years. It must have sapped his creative juices.Maye we'll never hear the ""old"" Neil again, a depressing thought, but if he's going to keep churning out Wal Mart background music, I wish he'd change his name so I won't be tempted again.Didn't some great musician once say ""Its better to burn out than to fade away?"" My my, hey hey.My love of Neil Young's music goes back to the early 70's in college and my admiration of him personally will never diminish. But his music has taken a change in direction that I no longer enjoy. Boring, tedious, mind-numbing, sing-song, chose your adjective. For anyone that has enjoyed his last few offerings (Greendale excepted), this one is sure to satisfy."
3,Medicore,"If this is the third installment of the ""Harvest"" trilogy, it is without a doubt the weakest of the three. ""Harvest"" and ""Harvest Moon"" blow this one out of the water. Usually with Neil, his albums grow on me after listening a few times but not this time.There are some good songs like the Painter (would fit perfctly on Silver & Gold), No Wonder and the best of the lot, Falling Off the Face of the Earth. There are also some duds like ""He was the King"" (way too long and repetitive) and the gagable title track, which sounds like a Greendale reject (it's that bad). I can only hope that I never hear these two songs again. The rest are nothing special.If you want a recent Neil Young album, you would be better served by ""Are you Passionate"" or ""Silver & Gold"" which are superior in my humble opionion. Prarie Wind will be going back on the shelf for now (with Greendale)."
3,Not the Old Neil Young....,"CD was average. Nice to hear from Neil Young again, but I was expecting more of his ""old sound""."
3,Prairie wind blowing through the harvest,"People rave about this being a latter-day masterpiece for Neil; sadly, while it's a good album, it falls far short of his true masterpieces, and it doesn't quite reach the level of Harvest Moon. The words no longer seem to flow from the heart, but from the mind, and there's a certain sameness to the sound that belies an awkward self-awareness. Still, Neil the chameleon deserves a lot of credit, even if he's not reinventing but revisiting."
3,Who Compared This To Harvest!?!,"I suppose if your mind is only capable of making a simple dichotomy, electric Neil Young and accoustic Neil Young, then this album would remind you of Harvest. Beyond that the comparisons end.This album has a psychedelic tinge that is more reminescent of his first, self titled album than it is of Harvest.Good songs throughout. Neil employs his atonal melody making to full effect, making a dark brew of meloncholy. Right when the depression threatens to overwhelm, he comes to the rescue with Far From Home, a rollicking journey complete with horn section.My only objection is the production. Neil's voice, as well as the high end of his guitar seem pushed to the back of the mix, making the album sound faux low budget. If you've complained that some of his work sounds too slick, this is his answer."
2,Surprisingly Bad,"When I bought this Cd I was hoping to hear Neil Young doing what he does best - the liquid, thin voice along with dramatic background music.Unfortunately, the CD is full of loser sounds, the ones you skip over on other CDs. They all sound like ""filler"" songs and to me were more irritating that anything. The musicians sound cheap and poorly shosen, and bad. Sorry, but Neil has much more talent than this."
1,"More Hash, Less Rehash","This album is lifeless and trite and all the more so when compared to the rest of the albums in his catalog. The hype surrounding this album smacks of the same fawning attempts to honor Dylan now that he has entered his washed-up phase. Like so many other reviewers have stated, buy the old stuff instead, its grittier, more powerful and more substantial-everything that Prairie Wind is not."
2,Neil Young Prairie Wind,I was expecting more out of this CD. Not so interesting as the classic Neil Young stuff
3,Bluebird Flies,"""See the bluebird fly back as in a dream, dippin' & bobbin' in the sun,"" opens ""No Wonder,"" my favorite track on ""Prairie Wind."" It has Neil's thundering guitar giving the song energy and his most determined vocal on the set. When Neil Young covered ""Imagine"" on the ""America: A Tribute to Heroes"" CD that was in response to the 9/11 tragedy, it was a stately reading that I believe would have made John Lennon smile. On ""When God Made Me,"" Neil attempts his own anthem and works fairly well with a powerful sentiment. The title track and ""He Was the King,"" an Elvis tribute, both are strong songs. The only track that makes me hit the skip button is ""Falling Off the Face of the Earth."" I also really like the artwork and packaging on the booklet. While this is not Young's strongest set, it is a fairly interesting set for those who like ""Harvest"" & ""Comes A Time."" Enjoy!"
5,Prairie Wind,"A must buy. Neil Young is an enduring classic and if you've enjoyed his folk rock over the years, you will certainly mellow out when you listen to his latest CD. ""Just a Dream"" is especially good listening."
4,Mature Neil Young,"Another positive review for this album. Some wonderful tracks here that just get more enjoyable with repeated playing. Young's voice keeps getting mellower and sweeter. Plus, his songs have great message. Great work, Neil."
2,Mediocre stuff from a great artist,"As a huge fan of NY since the late 60s this is a very mediocre album..The painter and This Old Guitar are very fine songs but the balance is sappy stuff with cornball lyrics...now I am a sucker for sentimental songs but all of Neil's imagery is childish and actually boring....he has sustained a brilliant and creative career for nearly 40 years,and his recent Greendale CD was fabulous...but Prairie Wind blows through your ears without leaving much behind....can't help but wonder if this was rushed out for personal reasons....a real downer from my favorite song writer/guitarist/and singer..."
2,Great Writing Set to Tepid Music,"I stock Neil Young records in the ""Must Have"" category. When I need the right words or the right crank, I put Neil on. That's not to say he puts both of these elements in the same song. He's got enough material to fertilize a cow pasture. Unfortunately musically, that's where most of this album belongs. Also unfortunately this record is being grouped in the Folk Rock genre along with Harvest, Harvest Moon and Comes a Time. This is realy Silver & Gold PtII. There's no semblance of country rock here that other publications are calling it. It just isn't. Tepid Folk music is more like it. The tempos drag as Neil tells his stories. And that's very unfortunate because the writing is superb. Whether it's due to him viewing his own mortality with his brush with death or the passing of his father last year, it doesn't matter. The word smithing is strong. It's too bad the vehicle the words ride on is only firing on a couple of cylinders"
1,"What an awful, awful album","If Neil had cranked out album's like this throughout his career his name would be linked with lesser singer-songwriters like James Taylor and Jackson Browne instead of Bob Dylan. I know what you are thinking, ""But he has done albums like this before! What about Harvest, Harvest Moon and Silver and Gold?!?!"". Sorry, but Prairie Wind is a pale imitation of those albums.The songwriting is weak and the arrangements are often saccharine and overbearing. I can honestly say that I enjoy ""Landing on Water"", ""Arc"" and ""Are You Passionate?"" much more than this album. At least LOW had ""Hippie Dream"", Arc took guts and AYP? had a great guitar tone. Prairie Wind just mocks all the good work Neil did wiith an acoustic guitar.If you are a collector it is a must but if you like good Neil Young music pass on this one and get the other acoustic albums."
2,Disappointed,"I am a big Neil fan and was disappointed by this album. Weak lyrics, no catchy melodies.....horns on a Neil Young album...ugh"
1,Boring,"I listen to this cd on his website and found it to be quite a bore it sounds like a copy cat version of his better cds but not in a good way. Before you get this make sure you have After the Gold Rush, Comes a Time, Harvest, and On the Beach these are way better albums that show Young's mellow side more effectively."
5,Essential Neil Young-Success,"I have long been a Neil Young fan. His music ""rings home"" to me. The music resonates as far back as the ""Crosby,Stills,Nash, and Young"" days. ""Prairie Wind"" is one of Young's best works. The album is one excellent performance followed by another.The music is symphony-like and captivating.I purchased the CD and the ""Heart of Gold"" DVD the same day. Subsequent to listening to ""Prairie Wind"", I said, ""Wow!"". I like the inclusion of the lyrics on the CD jacket. After viewing the DVD, I said, ""Spectacular!"". If a singer/songwriter should write about that which he knows, and a performer perform with both knowledge and heart-felt emotion, then these performances define success. As a son of the Prairie, I say ""Five stars."" and ""Two thumbs up!""."
4,An excellent story!,"Barbara Trapido writes beautifully. I have read all her books, but this one is my favorite. The characters are real and loveable"
1,"Cheap rubber with smeared paint, scuff marks...Not even remotely a ""collector's"" piece.","I ordered this with the intention of donating it to a Christmas toy drive thinking that a little boy or girl in the local Children's Hospital would have a lot of imaginative fun playing with a model space shuttle. When I opened the box, the space shuttle's packaging was partially opened and the space shuttle was full of dust and scuff marks. The paint job is awful, disjointed and scratched. As the package was already opened, I took the toy out to further examine it, and now my hands reak of the cheap rubber smell.This toy is garbage down to the MADE IN CHINA stamp on its underside. The only thing remotely good about it is that the patch is kind of neat but that is not nearly enough to make this worth purchasing.I would not recommend buying this product. I would be embarrassed to give this to any child, much less use it for the purpose that it was originally intended.I wish I could give it zero stars."
5,Great for the preschool imagination.,"This is a toy that the 4 year old loves and plays with a lot. It has no moving parts and nothing he can take off the vehicle (he likes to remove the wheels and tractor treads from his vehicles). It is made of a rubberized plastic, but in my house that is not a problem. I prefer toys that allow the child to use his/her imagination and in my household this fits the bill perfectly. The quality of the toy was not an issue. There are more than enough details painted/stenciled on the shuttle to make it look realistic. This is our second shuttle. The first shuttle got destroyed when the puppy got a hold of it and used it for a chew toy. So my only warning would be not to let the dogs get hold of it. It is made in China."
5,Awesom book,I've been reading this book for a week and I am not done yet but I wanna say as a college student this book has really touched to me. I think everyone should read this book to understand how could affect a mid-age crisis to a person.
2,Lost in stereotypes,"A decent book that could have been great, Homes's novel came off underbaked. Too many implausible plot lines that are hastily tossed in, incomplete, cookie-cutter characters, and a seeming desire on the part of the author to recreate the Los Angeles of ""L.A. Story"" sabotage an otherwise compelling story of a man who is trying to find his life again.Were this story focused on its characters more and their actual issues instead of attempting to impress readers with the flash and bang of its irrelevant events, this would have been a much more interesting book. Even the book's title suggests that Homes did not have a clear grasp on the point of this novel, and she spends 384 pages wandering around the desert trying to find it."
3,"Average, ordinary.","This book belongs to a wider and worn out end of the century postmodern literature.The plot is full of generally known situations, such as nutrition obsessed wealthy people, often ridiculous. The characters are interesting but numerous and sometimes irrelevant to the story.I also found the book poorly balanced, the first part is nearly insignificant. The slightly humorous book has its climax towards the end.Often the narration is tasteless, a bit thick and lacks originality.However, this book is well written and succeeds to deliver a message of redemption and change."
4,This Book Will Enrich Your Life!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this satirical look at Los Angeles and the culture of the misguided wealthy. As an L.A. resident, I often think about the collapse of the city - all these people and their money crumbling from an earthquake or burned by one of our enormous fires - but in Homes' book, the destruction is more than physical (geological?). Richard, the protagonist, takes the falling apart of his house to be a call to change his life. And so he does with a cast of quirky characters who provide him with the human touch he'd been avoiding for so long. What I enjoyed about this novel besides its unpredictability was how redemptive a story it really was. In an age of irony and cynicism, it was refreshing to read about a character who really does change for the better, who really does redeem himself in many ways. That is not something you get very often with modern novels. I highly recommend this book!"
4,This Book Will Save Your Life,"This Book Will Save your Life by A.M. Holmes is a story about a middle-aged man who is stuck in a routine lifestyle. His boredom with his uneventful life causes him to open up is eyes and view the world a different way. Throughout the story, Richard continuously finds himself in bizarre situations. He takes every chance he has to meet new people and to make them happier. Overall, Richard is an amazing man who strives to help others perform good deeds. This Book Will Save your Life is a beautifully written book. It keeps you interested through the whole novel and is almost always unpredictable. A.M. Holmes is a wonderful author and I really enjoy his work."
3,Emotionless,"I wanted to like this book, but I just can't recommend it. The idea of a self-absorbed stock trader being shaken out of his rutted life and finding the joy and satisfaction in helping others is certainly promising. However, I just felt that I was watching a movie that allowed me no insight into the mind or motivations of the characters. As Richard (don't call me Dick) Novak goes through his life, interacting with a movie star, a crying woman, a reclusive writer, a kidnapped woman, and various city functionaries concerning his sinkhole, we never find out how he feels about any of the odd events happening to him!When Ben, his son, enters the story, the emotions improve, but not to a satisfactory level, in my opinion. In addition, I have trouble sympathizing with a character who can simply buy what he wants to give to people, from cars to donut shops. Where's the angst in dropping down a wad of dough to console a broken heart?"
2,far fetched pablum disguised as art,"One more example of ther importance of connections to success. While there are some amusing things in this book, if you or I wrote it, it would never be published."
1,Boring Life of the Idle Rich,"This is the worst book I have read in a long time. The last thing I want to immerse myself in is the life style of the super rich and clueless in modern Los Angeles, complete with a staff to provide special ""health"" diets, a personal trainer, meaningless meditation retreats, $100K cars, and an all-white sex palace on the Malibu coast. The addition of walk-on parts for Bob Dylan and Gerald Ford only makes it more unreal. Nor to I need an unbelievable series of disasters, from sink holes to collapsing houses to freeway kidnaps to a Los Angeles firestorm to try to inject some plot into this unfocused story. As a straight novel, it is a failure. Some reviewers call it a satire, and perhaps that is a redeeming perspective, but the cover blurbs take this weird tale with amazing solemnity."
3,OK but not as good as her earlier work,"I loved Music for Torching; however, the ending of this book was a let-down. As always, Homes' prose is terse with no extraneous and unnecessary details, but here I didn't quite understand the ending. It was sorta ""hokey."" I loved 3/4s of this book, but the latter 1/4 kinda dragged. Her characters were believable and fun. Not quite sure what message Homes was trying to convey though."
1,Who is Scott Brick?,Why do you have a review from Publishers Weekly that uses the wrong name of the author? Seems someone is confused.
2,If you like reading for the sake of reading...,"Ultimately, this book is frustrating. It drones on like our own mundane lives, except the characters in the book are unbelievable. Everyone is an exaggeration. Too rich, too full of themselves, too over the top, too self serving.The conversations are all meaningless, except maybe the one where Richard's son tells him how he feels about their relationship.Even the ending of the book is unresolved and open ended.If you like reading for the sake of reading, I recommend it. If you're looking for inspiration to change your life, do what the hero did... walk out your door and open your eyes..."
5,very happy,"We loved the movie and watched it several times. It came in the mail very quickly. In fact, it came in the mail a couple of days later. The movie was good. I liked how the young man kept his head and worked with the police to get not only himself but his fellow classmates released from the hostage situation."
2,"Interesting, but definitely a made-for-TV movie","I was one of the real-life hostages, so I bought the movie as soon as I heard about it. I knew it was a made for TV movie, so I wasn't expecting Oscar quality. I realize this is only ""based on"" a true story, so they have some artistic license, but they definitely did not capture the mood of the real-life events. It is much more like a mash up of the real event and a 12 year old's pizza party, which I found insulting. We did crack jokes and try to lighten the mood, but that is something you have to do in order to deal with having a gun pointed at you all the time. I blame the direction. All of that aside, the movie was interesting to watch, even as a watered-down version of the events and I think it would be a good conversation starter for parents and their children. I also give Henry Winkler a hair comb and two thumbs up. ""ehhhhh"""
5,Prinze and Schroder deliver amazing performances,"I was impressed with the leads and this is a movie based on actual happenings. Prinze in one of his better roles and Schroder has never been better. the school shooting footage themselves might disturb a lot of viewers and it puts thoughts in your mind. Schroder is electric as the kid who was once a student at the school, comes back. Henry Winkler is great also as the police chief. powerful, violent to the extreme and a shcoking end that will leave you hanging."
4,An awesome experience!,"I was actually an extra in this film. During production the film was called ""Detention"". The director and everyone in the cast did an amazing job putting this movie together in the short time that it took. When I finally saw the finished version on television I was stunned at how mesmerizing this film actually was and I was there for the filming of most of it. There are several really good actors and actresses in this film and this is a most see kind of movie. Enjoy!"
4,Yummy Preqeul to Amazing Music,"I've always liked Imperative Reaction and somehow their music has managed to change in sync with my tastes. ""Eulogy for the sick child"" was a great album for it's time and still has some catchy tunes."
2,I'm not exited anymore.,"I ordered this thing and took the chance and I was let down. It's so lyricly boaring and musicly clitche. Same ol' stuff I've heard a million other times by a million other ""bands"". This is one of those albums that make you feel like running away from the EBM scene and becomming a hipster. Ok, not that bad, but this isn't anything would suggest. The next two album by IR that follow this are considerably much better, though still not five star records. Just stick to VnV Nation and Dismantled if you like future industrial music (or whatever). This is no place to start."
3,Serves its purpose,"The shelter is nice for having outdoors, although it takes awhile to put up and we have to weigh it down if there's wind otherwise it will blow away"
3,Not Instant!,"You need at least 2 people to set this up. The poles snap together so it takes some work, so its not instant. It provides great shade."
1,Pictures not what they appear to be.....,very disappointed in this item. it sits in my basement and will never be used. I assumed I ordered the entire tent structure based on the photos upon purchasing the item. turns out it was just the 'net'I would absolutely love to return this and get my money backThank you
3,Do not buy anything in a hurry!,"I cannot say something was wrong with the net, unfortunately i have the wrong canopy it took me a while to make it work for my equipment my family did not get bitten by the mosquito so it worked!do not get anything in that hurry that was my mistake .The one thing I have to say is that amazon .com delivered my product when they promised this company deserve 5+ stars love shopping at this site."
4,QuickShade Marketplace Screen,"This really kept the bugs out during our camping trip. It is a little hard to zip, but well worth the money!"
5,Canopy screen panel,I was real pleased with this screen panel kit.It was easy to install and fit perfectly. I wassuprised that Amazon carried these.
3,A little misleading,"I order this screen set to go along with my weekender 100. It will work fine, but I was expecting it to be a dark color like in the picture. When I opened the box it is white netting which gets dirty quick and does not blend with the earthy color of my canopy. All in all it will work fine although it was not what I was expecting."
1,Misguided Purchase,The photo and description do not reflect the product. The screen panel kit I received was white. What a huge inconvenience during a time-crunch.
3,We ordered it thinking we had a straight legged canopy,Turned out our Quick Shade is angled legged so the screen doesn't fit correctly. Good idea to check out the canopy set up before you order! We will keep it with the intention of getting a straight legged canopy.
1,Very few laughs!,"Hello World,Misguiding title and cover. Thought it would be like Rolling Kansas or Road Trip, not at all. His parents grow weed, so what! I could barely make it through the entire movie."
1,This video is strictly a Christian perspective,"This video comes at the issue of occultism from a strictly Christian perspective. While I will concede that the film makers mixed in some factual information with their profoundly biased critiques, I must warn viewers that the video is NOT an unbiased (or even terribly informative) documentary. You will find a few interesting comments and clips interspersed throughout, but nothing more.Those of you who are fans of well made documentaries should know that the ethics of proper reporting were not maintained during the production of this video. So, if you seek good, informative, information then you should look elsewhere. If, on the other hand, you are a christian person who wants information on the occult from a strictly christian (and opinion based) perspective, then you have found a perfect match."
3,ANOTHER TIME TWIST THING,"Let's say you could live your life over again, would you change anything knowing the outcome is going to be a disaster? You would, but who would watch the movie? This movie plays on a theme used in Twilight Zone episodes and various movies since the 1950's: Where the person sees themselves and integrates their present action to duplicate what has happened in the past. While it was done well in this movie, it didn't stand out as compared to others. Did anyone else notice that Melissa George got augmentations after the movie to pose for the cover? The movie drops the F-bomb a few times, but is not bogged down with swearing. It has killing and blood, but spares us gore. Everyone dies in the movie at least twice that we get to see."
3,Very strange movie,"Well, this movie didn't make a lot of sense to me. I'm reminded of some Star Trek episodes where the crew keeps repeating a block of time until they figure out how to get out of it. There were just too many holes in this movie in my opinion. Too many times I kept saying, ""Look honey, just go out and talk to them""! And at the end, where there were three copies of the woman, dead one in the trunk of the car, dead one on the road and the live one standing by. How did she end up on the beach?This movie had potential, but I feel the writers just didn't know how to finish it. I watched it for free, so at least I didn't lose any money over it."
2,Original Mystery film. Not a Ghost Ship or gory scenes,"This is a treu original mystery, best descried like one long twilight-zone mystery than a horror film. It plays with your mind and has less ""shock"" factor, as normal in films of the horror genere."
2,Boring movie don't waste your time,Don't bother watching this one unless you are really bored. The movie starts off good and then falls into a very tried formula and doesn't come close to a strong finish. Skip this one.
2,Time Tried,"TRIANGLE is one of those movies I can take or leave. It tries very hard to be original in plot but ultimately fails to really impress me. The ""time paradox"" or ""time loop"" is decent enough, but the film really does not scare or move me. I have to lump it into that group of films which I'm not sure I'm glad to have seen or not. I will give the film credit for all the reflection shots of the main character. Seeing her as double or even triple images really foreshadows the film. The acting was reasonably solid for the most part, but the story itself seemed to hopelessly grind on to the end."
4,Problem,"The problem is that there is no subtitles on any prime instant movie at all. It is so sad that Amazon.com company doesn't support and providing everything for its coumsters. This need to be changed. It is not on only this movie, but also all of others too."
4,Great rainy afternoon movie,Was looking for a good spooky movie to go with the weather outside and was pleasantly surprised at how good this was! Acting was very good. Setting creepy. Did get a bit tiring going back over and over the same scenes (you'll see what I mean if you watch but I guess that was part of the story). Well worth the watch!
3,That's the last time you ever take me on a cruise....,"I hate to admit it, so here goes: I was drawn to this film becauseMelissa George was the star. There, it's out in the open and I don'tcare who knows.The title may have been off-putting (just how many crappy bermudatriangle films have sunk without a trace is anyone's guess) but thislittle gem of a film took me by surprise and sucked me in frombeginning to end, back to the end, to the beginning and back again.George's performance was excellent and a testament to how far she hastravelled as an actor over the years. This film is a bloody good rompand with references to Memento it needs another viewing. Again.Mind you, any film with Melissa George is worth watching from back to front."
4,Hold on!,"You got to hang in there! It all comes to light at the end. It's like someone said, a bit of ""The Shinning"", movie that is. I didn't think I was going to enjoy it, but I did. Not a slasher flick."
2,Watch Timecrimes instead,"This movie tries to do the same thing that Timecrimes did, by showing what would happen if you got stuck in a time paradox but it doesn't do it as well. If you want to see it done right, see Timecrimes instead. That's a five star film."
1,DO NOT WATCH!!!,"this is my first amazon review, and i am writing because this movie is horrible!!! i tried to believe all the the positive reviews, but it was awful. i love psychological movies.....but this was just groundhog day with a horrible plot and no ending and leaves you wishing you had watched dora the explorer instead. seriously. i have never reviewed an item and i am telling you i threw aside my laziness just to save you from this movie. everyone who thought it was good has never seen a real film or is crazy!! DO NOT WATCH IT!!"
1,Seems to have no point. Don't waste your time.,"Allowing for the possibility that I am just too dense to understand it, this seems as pointless as it is boring. With the same repetitive scenes that make little if any point the first time, any more than the rest. Certainly not plausible, even for fiction, this is bizarre film of a crew that takes a cruise on a small boat, capsizes in the Bermuda Triangle, its passengers rescued by a passenger ship without passengers or crew. One of the woman keeps reappearing, after being killed over and over again, frequently by herself (a double, triple, etc.) I watched this my wife who agreed with this. Even the genre is not clear -- not exactly a horror film; certainly not a mystery, except for the mystery of why it was even made. Don't waste your time or money."
1,No plot,The story plot of this movie sucked. It started going on a boat trip it ended going back on the same boat trip. She was in this time still world that she kept re-livin. The question is WHY. The movie did not give a reason. What happened to make her go into this state. It started in the time still state and ended the same way. I will never watch this movie again. I gave it one star because that is lowest grade I can go.
4,I thought it was a damn good movie.,"I can't see what is wrong with this movie other than it's running time is way too short, but that is the case with almost all movies anymore. Anyway it's a very vivid well written and well casted movie. I would watch it again."
4,An unexpected hit,"I stumbled on this one on another online movie site and based on the 4 out of 5 stars, figured I had nothing to lose but time. Turns out, it's a really good movie. Very dark Twilight Zone-esque sort of plot with mind bending twists and turns that are sure to leave you asking questions. As soon as you think you know what is happening, the plot takes another sharp turn. If you liked the original Twilight Zone, you'll definitely enjoy this one."
4,Not for everyone,"I was Intrigued by the reviews so I decided to watch out of curiosity. The movie starts off with a feeling of confusion as to how the story was going to progress and yet I found myself playing the plot out in my mind without really paying attention to the beginning. I am not going to go into detail, but I will tell you that the ending is just the beginning."
4,VERY interesting,"I almost didnt watch this movie because the reviews were so mixed, But im very glad I did. It was actually a good movie. I didnt watch the trailer or read what it was about, just went in with an open mind. It takes twists I wasnt expecting, sucked me in rather quick. By half way thru I was wondering where it would go because I thought it was almost over. Now that its over I'm like wow why wouldnt any one watch it. There is not a lot of gore, there is suspence, not alot of spooks, no ghosts, DO NOT THINK burmuda triangle movie if and when you watch it, the name of the boat they sail on is called triange. It will be on my list of movies to watch again!!"
2,Okay movie and troublesome loading,"The movie kept getting stuck. It was so annoying to watch. The movie itself was okay. I don't know if its just me, but I didn't get the ending. I don't wanna spoil it. I had to think about it, but it just didn't make any sense. The peices don't fall together as they should."
3,Incosistency and 'Yelling at actress' syndrome killed this for me.,"The cinematography was pretty good but the amount of retarded decisions the main character made really killed the movie for me. You should watch it, but you shouldn't expect a solid and logical outcome."
2,B movie,"The movie was kind of low budget and more like a college film class movie/project than anything. Some disconnects in it where the story didn't make sense. The overall concept was interesting, using greek myth to drive the theme. B movie when you're bored."
2,Frustrating,"I found this movie most frustrating and irritating like Groundhog Day - that must be the most awful way to go on and on and on and on... in a bizarre way the movie makers accomplished the task of getting the point across! Not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea!"
3,A Depressing Go-Nowhere Movie,"I'm always interested in stories about the Bermuda Triangle so I thought I'd give ""Triangle"" a try; it was not what I was expecting.In one regard I have to give this movie credit, it was well planned. The only problem was it didn't make any sense; if you're looking for a movie with an explanation this is not one of those.I have to admit it was intriguing enough that I watched it all the way through, hoping there would be some resolution to the puzzle which there wasn't. There was lots of gore and blood so if this kind of thing entertains you this may be a good choice.The movie, for its type, is well crafted and creates suspense and even curiosity about how it's going to end. There was, for me, a surprise twist at the ending which I totally didn't expect.I would recommend watching it before you buy it."
3,Just ok and a little boring,"If you like Groundhog Day you will enjoy this movie....sorta the same old, same old....time and time again. Would not watch again."
1,lame as sin! did not like it!,Boring!! wasn't expecting watching same scenes over and over! Next time I will pay attention what I am buying. Comparing to any other movies I would not recommend this movie.
1,waste of time,This was a huge wasteof time. Wow. Read reviews before i wztched andpeop.e seemed to like this movie. Awful this moviegoes nowhere. Booo
1,Jacked Up!!!!,Seriously???? This movie was jacked up! Like a Ground Hogs Day only worse.. way worse. I can't even explain how bad this movie is. Some of you people rated this 4 and 5 stars??? What the hell are you smoking and PLEASE send some my way so I can watch this movie again and see is it gets any better!
1,So bad it hurt.,"I rented this off iTunes, and I wish I didn't. It's your basic time-loop flick. The acting sucked, writing sucked. The best part of the film was the 30 seconds of CG weather. Don't waste your money."
1,Contrived and unbelieviable,"The plot for this film is completely contrived. The entire plot relies on itself for advancement and framework, and doesn't follow any sort of universal logic or boundaries.If you're a fan of mindless suspense, then you might enjoy this film, but if you expect your movies to provide you with a believable framework, don't bother.The plot to this film is so outlandish and so poorly explained that it made it completely unenjoyable for me.You basically figure out the entire scope of the movie within the first 30 minutes and then just watch what you predict unfold before your eyes in it's painfully contrived and cliche form.Save your time and watch a different movie. This one is not worthy of your time."
4,Good movie,"A movie that I didn't really think would be that good but turned out to be a very good movie. If you want to watch a movie that will get you thinking then watch this. I can't really say too much about the movie but it involves a group of people that go out to sea in a yacht and then capsize. They are stranded and end up being saved by a mysterious deserted liner. Once on board things start to take a turn for the worse and well I can't really say much more. Have a cuppa, sit back and enjoy this movie."
5,Loved it from 1/4 in through the end.,"Creepy thriller; Bermuda Triangle(implied); Time Loop; Dollars-to-doughnuts you will not see the ending coming, and it doesn't feel like a cheat."
2,not impressed,"Not impressed, slow moving and not a plot I was happy to watch. Expected something more exciting, but fell far short in my opinion."
4,Twisted like a Klein bottle,Had no expectations when I received this film.Thought it was going to be another slightly entertaining B-movie.A certain set of events moved rather fast and made me wonder a little bit.Especially the way it happened and what was said by the characters.Then a few scenes later I was flabbergasted.And after that it kept throwing out ropes of disbelief.Put me in the mind of certain sci fi films I have seen.And there is still one character who appeared near then end that I am wondering about.I have an idea of what that character may represent but it may be nothing.Surprised me with its quality.Good film.
2,Unfullfilled,"I found I was drawn into the movie and the mysterious story line the longer it went. And actually I thought it was an excellent mind twisting plot, very well acted, and very well directed. But that was the problem. Just when I was ready for the 'cycle' to be broken and for the movie to come to conclusion, there wasn't a conclusion! It just started over again. Many folks can overlook the ending and rate this movie highly, but I can't forgive the ending and how unfullfilled I felt after watching the movie. The ending was such a let down and completely ruined the enjoyment of the first part of the movie for me and I felt like I had just wasted an hour and a half."
4,Great psychological horror film that requires a little thinking,"This is a gem of a film that most people don't know about. I won't go into spoilers, but suffice to say it has a multi-layered plot and it takes some thinking after it's over to figure out what happened. The less you know going in the better. A second viewing is almost essential to really appreciate and enjoy it. There are clues and symbols cleverly scattered througout. The movie follows an internal logic and does indeed make sense. I think that the few one star reviews are from people who didn't get it or didn't like having to use their brains a little bit. The photography is good and the performances are mostly good. I have seen this film 3 times now and have noticed something new each time. Highly recommended for people who are sick of brainless, formulaic hollywood horror films."
4,Amazing Thrill Ride,11pm after a 5 hour nap from an exhausintg day of work I put this movie in and expected to fall back asleep watching it. The film woke me up!! The twists and turns are enough to give you a headache but I enjoyed the complexity of it all. Amazing actress in the lead role and I was right with her along the way. It wasn't the greatest movie I've seen but sure one I'd suggest others see.
5,Very good...,"First off I have never felt the need to write a review before this movie but I see so many people giving this a bad one I wanted to add my 2c.This may be one of the best ""loop"" movies i have ever watched. It has so much going on inside of that I found myself constantly wondering what would happen next and how it was going to happen. By no means am I a film critic or would ever claim to be one, but the acting in this movie seemed very spot on to me. Watching a woman struggle with so many emotions that she seemed to play so naturally was a real pleasure.I really dont want to say much because anything I do say will almost be a spoiler to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. If you're looking for a new movie to try and and are into a sci-fi/fantasy element then I would definatly give this a look. Very well made and one that you will be thinking about for a long time after watching it."
1,"Please do not watch, this is 2hrs you will never get back","This movie was horrible. If you enjoy crossword puzzles you make like this movie if your intoxicated. But if you just want straight entertainment select something else. I have no problem with a movie challenging me as a viewer, but it repeated the same scenes several times and still did not provide a solution to the main character's problem. For a suspense/horror this movie was a straight H.A.M. (Hot A$$ Mess)."
1,wasted my ever precious time,I freakin wasted my precious time watching this movie ugh!I stuck to almost the end because I was hoping it would get interesting in the end but NOPE! Im still mad at myself. I could've watched something else. As a bored mother of a newborn I am mad I wasted my time on this. I hardly get to watch a movie since my daughter was born and when I found one I just wasted it on this. I felt like I will go nuts watching the same scene over and over and over smdhAnd oh I am using my fiancee's account hence the guys name ;)
1,Waste of time,Don't waste your time watching this movie. It goes around and around in circles to no where. This movie tries to do what classics like the Fog did so well but it failed miserably so find something better to do with your time.
1,sucked,"This thing I won't even call it a movie. Such a waste of time. Science fiction groundhog day with no resolution. Unoriginal, stupid, what can I say. Please don't waste your time. Had to give it one star for my review. If I could give it - 5 stars I would."
5,Awesome grip,"Very comfortable, had carpal tunnel surgery and this makes a huge difference, especially on a longer walk. Love the gold accent too."
5,Palm Grip Cane,"This is a great cane - very light weight , colorful and the palm grip is great. My PT person recommended this grip because I have minor issues with my hand but it would work no matter the issue . Hope you enjoy!"
5,Impeccable musicianship and phrasing,"These are wonderful historical recordings that are very well transferred. Most enjoyable is the patrician 'pianism' by both Horszowski and, particularly, Szell (in K454 and K481.) While the uninitiated may find Szigeti's astringent and somewhat insecure tone unsettling, the reason for purchasing this set should be the delight imparted by the impeccable musicianship of the artists."
2,"Poorly researched, poorly edited...","If you are looking for solid facts, this is not something you need to invest in. I agree with several other reviewers in that I noticed that the infamous Elizabeth Bathory had her name mutilated by the author as Bathroy and not just a typo! Even though the Bathory issue was NOT a typo, I found several of those as well. Another thing that was in error was with the Susan Smith excerpt...the author states that she drove her children into a river. I live in SC and know for a fact that Susan Smith drove her children into a lake. Horribly written with a lot of the word ""um"" in the pages (which I find very irritating) and what appears to be a lot of ""fluff"" that just isn't necessary. I am currently reading the book from the prospective that these are just stories and looking at the book that way makes it almost entertaining.....but still not factual."
2,"Great concept, poor execution...","Great concept for a book, but not well executed. Too many typos (Countesss Elizabeth Bathory, the ""Blood Countess,"" is listed as having the last name of ""Bathroy,"" just as one example), showing that the book was not proofread very well . The author also uses web sites and magazines for sources, many of which have erroneous information about these women.Better research techniques, and a decent editor would have helped immensely. I was very disappointed."
2,Not factual at all,"I read this book and was sorely disappointed. As an avid true crime fan, I was very disappointed. This author had witnesses's names wrong as well as pertinent facts about the case. I knew more than she did about most of the women she wrote about. Don't waste your money unless you don't care if the book is fact-based. This book was thrown together without any research, or so it appears."
2,Champion of Love,"The Champion of Love Song is not the regular classic sung by the Cathedrals for example. If you're looking for that song sung by Glad, this album doesn't have it. There is only one a cappella song on this cd and it is the same one found on The A Cappela Project, God Is My Rock."
5,Beautiful watch,"I love this watch. It was much less expensive here. When you put it on, you'll fall in love with it. The color is a deep navy and the luminescent hands are very easy to read. Also, it's Swiss made. I like bigger watches(40mm) and this one is perfect!"
1,a disappointing bore,"I was so looking forward to this novel - a somewhat trashy page-turner with an interesting historical backdrop. Well, it wasn't a page-turner, and the historical backdrop was so far from believable that I had no interest. It was trashy and truly juvenile. Frankly, I'm shocked that so many people have rated this novel highly. If you want a fun, trashy, historical page-turner, try Anne Rice's ""Cry To Heaven."" That was a guilty pleasure which I loved. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" falls miles short."
1,No zero stars?,"I love books! I buy them, I read them, I have difficulty loaning them out let alone giving them away. This book I will burn, if for no other reason than to spare another who might be tempted by the title (as I was) to expect a readable, historical, novel. I could forgive the historical inaccuracies if Ms Gregory had given some thought as to how they could propel the story, or if the characters were more than cardboard.Too bad there is not a rating below one star."
1,The worst historical fiction I've ever read,"I am astonished that this was published...it's truly awful, historically inaccurate. It reads like the author read a couple of books about the period, took notes and then forgot all the facts on record. Anne was the younger sister, for example. There is no record that she ever committed incest with her brother George. The early years at the French court are omitted, which provide an insite as to why the Boleyns began their rise to power."
1,very poor quality,"I am surprised at so many positive reviews. The prose in this book is very poor quality, it's simplistic, repeptitive and many times plain silly. It reads like a quick amateur effort. While I think that the autor is entitled to the right to fictionalize some characters or events, i can't understand why her language is so dismal."
3,readable but missing period color,"I bought this book in an airport Powell's Books, so I was in a bit of a hurry. I was intrigued by the theme and the book had good shelftop reviews. I guess I need to be more aware of the line between historical fiction and popular history, since I prefer the latter muchly. Being a student of language and language use, I was especially disappointed by the dialog and even the internal thoughts of the characters in this book. I still read it rapidly for the narrative line, but I kept feeling I was getting the Disney version of the story. As a student of literature (albeit 18th century) I would have thought Philippa Gregory would be more attentive to style than she was. Some people will love this book, but if you require at least a semblance of authenticity, it isn't for you."
2,way too long !,"This book was great for the first 200 pages or so, and at first I could not put it down, but after that it was all downhill.. the same things happend over and over again.. so much drama about such stupid things ! It became boring and predictable. It was hard to make myself finish this book."
2,An Airplane Read - not for serious readers,"There is an unfortunate trend towards the quasi-historical in popular novels today, and some rather terrible books get written in order to cash in on it. The Other Bolyn Girl is one of these books - it could have been better, it could have been *great* - but it was damaged by lack of research, childish writing, and the author's obvious purpose to cater to bored housewives and sex-crazed sorority sisters. If you're looking for serious fictionalized history, this is not the place to get it. You'll be disappointed. But if you need something to read on an 8-hour trans-Atlantic flight, then perhaps it's almost readable."
5,Excellent,I wish I had not read it so that I could read it again for the first time. It was an excellent book.
5,Great Historical Novel entertainment!,"Reading about court life from Anne Boleyn's sister, Mary's point of view was great fun! This was the first historical novel I read, and since then I have read 20 more, yet I am still yearning to find something as spellbinding as this one."
4,Made me buy other books about King Henry and his wives,I love Historical Fiction and this was a great book. It made me more interested in King Henry and all his wives. In high school I always that that he had beheaded all his wives. See what an interesting book can do? I went out and bought Alison Weir's book called The Six Wives of Henry VII just too continue where this book left off.
2,Historical romance,I think this would like to be taken as a plausible fictionalisation of history told from an unusual perspective but it's really just a romance in fancy dress and hence not my cup of tea.
5,Wonderful Historical Novel,"This is the first Phillipa Gregory novel I read, and I tore through it. I really enjoyed how Gregory takes actual historical events and then uses her skill to create a story that absolutely captivates. It's hard to remember, at times, that it is fiction, and wonderful to learn more about a period while enjoying a fantastic read."
5,A simultaneously informative and torrid read,"This book was incredible-- hands down one of the best pieces of historical fiction I've ever read. Not only does Gregory nail the pliable nature of sisterly rivalry, she succeeds in bringing an unknown heroine to life. I could hardly put this book down. Little known detailed facts about the life and daily tasks of those in Henry VIII's court arise throughout this story making every page essential. And at the book's harrowing, bittersweet and shocking end, Gregory masterfully handles a situation you have to read to believe. I was moved and educated by Gregory's tale and urge everyone to delve into this worthwhile novel."
4,Liked it - Hated it,"Everybody has already said everything, so I'll just add that I'm on the fence here. I did enjoy it as a light ""read,"" but I appreciate historical accuracy and, as pointed out in a few of the reviews, history took a bit of a beating. I know a few historical writers and admire their striving after historical accuracy. It's a shame with such a rich tapestry from which to select, that Gregory played loose with the facts.On the up side, it's a fast and entertaining read. I had no problem with Anne's and Mary's dialog. I enjoy a little down-and-dirty, which is probably closer to the way people actually talked at the time and behind closed doors. The courtly speech rang true for me as well."
4,Excellent read...couldn't put it down!,"This book is marvelous! It is so well written, and is worth the 7 dolllars you'll invest to get it!"
5,Great historical fiction. Read it!,"This book was so very interesting. I highly recommend it to historical fiction lovers. I couldn't put it down and when I did, I couldn't wait to get back to it."
5,"A magnificent page-turner, wow!","This is by far the best book that I have read in a long time. A beautiful historic novel, couldn't put it down. Never a dull or boring moment, just flawless. Highly recommended!"
3,A Provocative study,"Historical fiction, particularly about the role of women is incredibly interesting. Although there were certain portions of this book which seemed inplausible or out of historical context, on the whole it was engaging. The rights and duties of a women at that time in such circumstances was quite worthy of reflection."
5,fabulous!,"I absolutely couldnt put this book down. I was sad when I was done because I didnt want it to end. Afterwards be sure to read The Queen's Fool or The Virgin's Lover, loved those too! I have even contemplated re-reading all of these because they are so great."
5,Loved it!,"I don't usually read historical fiction books. I primarily read fiction action/mystery books but my friend convinced me to read this one. Boy, am I glad that she did! Every page kept my attention. I couldn't wait to read what debauchery, deception or plotting was happening next. Highly recommended."
1,Tawdry,"For a classier historical novel about the Boleyns, I recommend The Lady in the Tower by Jean Plaidy."
2,not very interesting,This book reads like a romance novel and doesn't have much depth. The characters aren't very well defined and they seem two dimensional. I've read other much better historical novels than this.
3,Hard to get thru,"I saw the movie and thought the book would be pretty good, after all the books are usually better then the movie. This was not the case here. The book is well written, but in that sort of your English teacher makes you read it cause it's a good example of well written technical fiction. Its not too enjoyable, it doesn't flow well. I found it very hard to relate to the characters or feel anything for them, regardless of the fact they were real people.What was even harder for me was the age of the main character and her lust for the king, I mean the girl was 13 or 14 in this book. The author talks about lust, passion, and love -- the age of the girl in the book made it very unbelievable. I had to force myself through it. I wouldn't recommend it -- if you are looking for anything similar to the movie here you won't find it."
4,We love the Tudors!,"1. The Other Boleyn Girl - Phillippa GregoryI love all things Tudor. This novel is the best of them all -- illuminating the little known story of Mary Boelyn, the sister of doomed queen Anne Boelyn whose marriage to King Henry VIII broke the Roman Catholic influence on England and begat one of the country's most prominent rulers: Elizabeth I. But before all that there was Mary, the king's mistress and mother of his illigitimate children. In this world women are pawns in a royally dangerous game, their male family members vying for checkmate. Gregory's other novels track the Tudors from Queen Katherine and Henry's brother, Arthur to Mary, Elizabeth and back again. Do yourself a favor and skip the Boelyn Inheritance and the movie version of The Other Boelyn Girl.This book has made my Top 5 Historical Fiction list. See the rest of it here: http://www.bookishlyreviews.com/2009/03/thursday-top-5s-historical-fiction.htmlRead all of our reviews here: www.bookishlyreviews.com"
5,Fantastic!,This is one of the best books I have ever read. I could not put it down. Excellent to say the least.
4,very interesting,"I really enjoy historical fiction to begin with, so I think this book was very interesting from the start. At times it got a little boring especially in the beginning but it had a great plot and very dynamic characters. I think the author made a good effort to show everyone that in the end it was Anne's character that made the king dislike her, however she had become that kind of person to attract him even more for greedy purposes and for him. Its very sad what becomes of Anne. I know its a historical account so a lot is untrue, but it still made me upset in the end."
3,Not bad for what it is,"If you are looking for a light diverting read, this is it. If you are looking for historical fact about the lives of the Boleyns, this is most assuredly NOT it.It's not history, nor is it great literature, but I don't really think it's meant to be either. I recommend it only if you understand what you're getting yourself into; otherwise, you will be bitterly disappointed."
4,"Fascinating historical topic, great read","I read ""The other Boleyn girl"" within a few days. The story was well told and well paced, and I like the way the main character develops. I have read a few history books about this period in English history, and thought the historical facts were pretty accurate. The historical figures really come to life in the novel.I'm subtracting one star because I found the development of Anne's character somewhat one-dimensional, turning the character almost into a caricature. It's hard to believe that any sisterly love could still have survived in view of such ruthlessness."
1,Not worth the time,"First let me say that the purchasing end of this exchange was excellent. The book reached me promptly and was in fine condition physically. If only the writing were at least half as fine. The conversations sounded 20th century, not remotely 16th century. Nor did they sound like genuine exchanges among the Boleyn siblings but instead like devices to let the reader know explicitly what was going on in the palaces and historically. The author's choice of starting with a wholly naive narrator (Mary in her early teens) and increasing her knowledge and perceptiveness was not unwise in itself, but was clulmsy in execution. She seems altogether too dense for too long, and even after she's much more worldly still frequently demonstrates her ""cotton head"". There's no denying that the Tudor era was racy and dangerous. If this is the only book at hand on that subject, grab it and skim."
1,Dreadful!,"I wish I'd read the bad reviews first, because they're all correct. This is a dreadful book, the kind you keep reading because you hope it'll get better. It never did, and now I have lost too much time to Ms. Gregory's desperate attempt at telling a story. Inaccurate, tedious, padded, silly."
1,soft-core porn masquerading as historical fiction,"I see from the other reviews here that I will be in the minority, but this may be the most moronic book I have ever read. If you care anything about history, avoid this book at all costs. Frankly, if you have any self-respect at all, avoid this book. I doubt my opinion will change the Cult of Philippa Gregory, but I feel compelled, by the very awfulness of this book, to speak my mind. It's no more than a jazzed-up Harlequin Romance with a few historical references thrown in for kicks. Absurdity on every page and an insult to anyone of intelligence."
5,Great fiction with a historical basis,"This was a wonderful book, hard to put down. The author very effectively blends historical fact with her own imagination of characters' motives and feelings. Very well done and enjoyable."
1,I Lost It!!,I lost this book after about the first 50 pages. I think that I did it on purpose. If I want to read fairy tales I will go back to the Brothers Grimm.
1,Review Based on the First Few Pages,"Maybe I know too much about Tudor England. The author's placing Anne as the eldest sibling bugged me right off the bat, as I'm almost positive most historians see her as the younger sister. Or, maybe I'm too big a fan of the fascinating Anne to buy anything from boring cow Mary's perspective, I don't know. All I know is, I've only read the first few pages and I'm bored and turned off by this book. I should want to read it. I bought it. But somehow, I just can't be bothered. I recently read a book about Frida Khalo written from her jealous sister's perspective, and it was [junk], so maybe it's bad vibes. Either way, this book isn't nearly as interseting as it's title would suggest."
4,Hooked on historical fiction!,"A friend recommended this book a year ago. I wasn't interested in this era before and thought it might be a romance novel. I was wrong. Excellent book. I couldn't put it down. I read it in record time and then moved onto Boleyn Inheritance, Queen's Fool and Constant Princess. I would also like to thank the publisher for the excellent Kindle price ($7.99). The White Queen is waiting in the wings. Keep up the good work, Philippa!"
4,The Other Boleyn Girl,"Having Studied History in College and recently watched the film of ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", i was very impressed with the book and found it hard to put it down, it had very vivid images and one could almost imagine themselves in each scene looking on as the story unfolded. Very enjoyable read and gave a great insight into the the Boleyn's as a family."
5,Great Read,"I quite enjoyed this book, my first by Gregory. The way she tells the story, from the point of view of Mary, created an easy to follow flow throughout the book. I read it in 3 days, finding it impossible to put down. It was scandalous, heart-wrenching, and entertaining from start to finish. While I can't attest to the historical accuracy, I was looking for a good historical fiction novel and found it here."
5,Enjoyable historical fiction,"I purchased this book some years ago to read during a long car ride because the book was long, and I am a fan of historical fiction (and non-fiction too, for that matter.)I was pleasantly surprised. The book is well-written, engaging, reasonably fast-paced, and I didn't notice any jarring anachronisms or inaccuracies of the sort that usually ruin historical fiction. The story is interesting, to boot, although I was not especially gripped by the love-story aspect.Having not had the privilege yet of reading any Jean Plaidy, the closest author I can compare this to is Sharon Kay Penman, and I have to say that if you like Penman, Gregory's THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL will not disappoint you."
4,Gregory's Best Work!,"I had read other Phillipa Gregory books before, but this is really the best one there is. If you are at all interested in the Tudor period you should read this book for it's lush portrayal of the period, even though it lacks some historical accuracy. The story of Mary Boleyn's life, along with that of her more famous sister Ann, is fascinating, and will interest any history buff."
3,"Good, but not historically accurate.","While the book itself was a very entertaining read, one should remember that this is historical fiction, the emphasis being on FICTION. I enjoyed the book greatly, the characters are all very interesting and the glimpse into the life of a courtier entertaining, but if you are looking for a book that will tell you what really happened to the Boleyn girls you'd best look elsewhere. The half third to quarter of the book is filled with major inaccuracies. That aside, it did serve to pique my interest in Anne Boleyn, her family, and her times as well as provide a few enjoyable hours of reading."
5,I couldn't put it down,"I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much. The greater than 600 pages was a ""quick read"". After finishing I was interested in researching the facts about that era."
2,With so many BETTER books about the Tudor court...,"With so many BETTER books about the Tudor court available, why bother to read this flighty one that reads more like a cheap romance novel than historical fiction? The dialog is insipid; I don't need the characters to speak in authentic period dialog, but I do need them to sound like the intelligent and well educated courtiers they were. I haven't read any of Gregory's other work, but after starting with this book I won't be back. The best thing about the book is that it reads quickly and is over fast."
4,Trashy...,"The characters in this book are, for the most part, absolutely disgusting. I felt guilty reading it, like I was reading some trash romance novel and I think I'll hide it the bookcase in the back of the house so no one who comes over sees it... but I have to say, it's a definate page turner. Well over 600 pages read in two days. And I'll probably read the sequel sometime soon. It's not the most well-written book, but it will definately hold your attention for a little guilty pleasure."
2,"Interesting at first, but then.....","Like many others who have read this book, I've been fascinated by the Tudor era and have read quite a lot about it. I enjoyed the idea of a story written from the perspective of the sister and it was interesting up to a point, but then....Anne Boleyn is portrayed as such a hideous harridan that it's almost unbelievable that Henry VIII would have put up with her. Philippa Gregory has also taken every single accusation and rumor thrown at Anne during her trial (when her enemies were hell bent on character assassination) and uses them all as fact. (brief spoiler), When Anne essentially gives birth to Rosemary's Baby/Eraserhead I actually laughed out loud.A good attempt, but ultimately this book disappointed me."
5,Best book this summer,"I read a lot of historical fiction -- and more than a few about Henry the 8th and Elizabeth I's time -- but this was by far one of the best I've ever read. I couldn't put it down, and stayed up all night two different evenings until I fell sleep. Even knowing that the general outcome of Anne Boleyn, it was completely fascinating the way Phillipa Gregory developed every character in this book. Each person became alive -- good and bad, villain and angel -- so that you felt like you actually could see these people, hear them talk and knew them intimately. It's a tale about the human spirit, and a wonderful love story that is intricately woven in with a great deal of historical fact. Anyone who loved the trilogy about Josephine Bonaparte will especially love this story."
1,Bored Out of My Gourd,"This was all plots and plans and no action. While it might have pictured what life was actually like in the Boleyn/Howard family, there was no action to it -- and I know that ""plots and plans"" can actually make a decent book, because ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" proves it!Thankfully, I didn't buy this book alone (I bought it at the same time I bought ""The Queen's Fool""), or I would've discounted Ms. Gregory as a truly boring author altogether. Hopefully, this book was just a fluke and her others (like ""The Constant Princess"" and ""The Virgin's Lover"") are just as good as ""The Queen's Fool""."
1,The Other Boleyn Girl,This book is a NOVEL and none of it is factual. I am British and brought up / educated in Britain and spent years on English history and believe me this is fantasy masquerading as fact. It will make the author pleny money and leave American readers believing this drivel. If you really want to know the facts then read a history book.The Other Boleyn Girl (Movie Tie-In)
1,Dreadful Historical Romance,"The Other Boleyn Girl is overlong, filled with tedious and unnecessary descriptions of Henry VIII-era women's clothing, barely touches on the genuine religious background for the novel (indeed makes it seem that the principal reason for the break between England and the Church of Rome was because of the machinations of the Boleyns) and despite the title is more about Anne Boleyn and Henry than the Mary of the title. The narrative is simply heavy-handed. Mary seems to be everywhere anything important is happening or manages by chance to overhear important information or picks it up via weakly developed exposition. It's supposed to be a historical romance, but there's precious little genuine history and and not a lot of romance. Oh . . . and the ending takes 700-plus pages to get to, but it's all telegraphed by page 350 or so."
2,What more can I say?,"Everything I feel about this book has already been said. It is slow moving and riddled with historical inaccuracies. I can forgive the boring writing style, because it is not my type of book. The incorrect facts, however, are harder to ignore. There are very few facts known about Mary Bolyen it shouldn't be too hard to keep them straight. That being said, if the story interests you, read it merely as a work of fiction. Then, get some Alison Weir for the history."
4,History is fun!,"I was never a big fan of historical books, but I really enjoyed reading this book about the other Boleyn girl. I found myself so fascinated by the story that I researched it further to find out how much was really factual. I would not have thought that a book about snobby English royalty was going to be good, but I was pleasantly surprised. I ended up happy with the ending even though it was much like watching the Titanic movie. You knew how it was going to end, but yet the story in the middle was quite compelling. I switched gears mid-way through the book on my feelings about the main characters. I started out feeling sorry for Anne and jumping for joy at the end when her head fell in the basket. Mary was a great character and I enjoyed the fictional development around her by the writer to really make you feel how she was feeling. It was great. I recommend it if you want to learn something or just to be pleasantly entertained."
3,Good But Too Long,"I read some but, mostly listened to this novel on CD.The narrator was excellent. The problem with listening to a CD is that you can't skim and skip parts . The story went on and on. Despite this, the story is interesting and the characters are well drawn. Th only person I liked was Catherine of Aragon. Both Boleyn girls were treated by their family like whores however; I still didn't like them .Henry the VIIIcame across as a philandererer. I liked the story and learned a great deal about the Boleyn family .Phippa Gregory reminded me of Jean Plaidy who wrote historical novels thirty years ago."
3,Sufficient Distraction,"My wife bought this book and I started reading it because I had nothing else to read on an 12 hour overseas plane trip. The subject matter and style of the book is something I definitely wouldn't normally pursue for my own reading, but after reading 100 pages or so, I found myself reluctantly drawn to the story and characters. I'm not in a position to judge its historical accuracy, but I doubt many people pick up this book with this in mind. Basically, it is the story of the English royal court and all the ""soap opera"" type intrigue you might expect in such a setting. The prose and the characterizations are simple and laced with some racier details of the main characters' interactions that sometimes made me wandered if I wasn't reading one of those cheap ""romance"" novels. It is all too easy to pick apart this novel from a variety of aspects, but after completing the novel, I didn't feel the least bit cheated. It definitely provided me with a sufficient distraction."
3,good historical fiction,"This book was fun to read because it was written from Ann Boleyn's sister's point of view. This was convenient because you get to know Ann Boleyn and George Boleyn and King Henry very well, without the disappointment of having the narrator beheaded. The author portrays the sordid immorality of King Henry, the narrator's craving for family and love, and Ann Boleyn's unstated desire for power and wealth. Obviously, the narrator survives and the evil sister, well, has another well known fate. The vague reasons for Ann Boleyn's death are logically theorized in this book. It's just pretty fun to read and historically accurate, as far as we could know, but it has some kind of sexy scenes in it."
1,What a Load of Royal Rubbish!,"It wasn't the historical background that irritated me, that was quite well researched and believable in its rendering of daily life in Tudor England. What bugged the crap out of me was the characters and their motivations. The overall tone of this book was that of a particularly bad romance novel. Henry VIII's most dominant trait was selfishness, both as a King and a man, and yet here we see him portrayed as a tender and devoted lover. I was near to gagging before I was half way through this book. It takes an awfully bad book to make me not finish it, but I came close to launching this one out the window. It went to the book exchange so fast that Phillippa Gregory's head is probably still spinning."
4,4+ actually; great plot and really hot,"There is quite a bit of raunchy in this one. Of course you have a good sister and a bad one. Lots of unexpected ""bumps"" along the way. Worth reading but the movie is nothing to compare. A book is always so much better."
5,The Other Boleyn Girl,Enjoyed the book. Easy to read. Read this book even if you have seen the movie. Gives you more details and makes you understand the time in history better. I highly recommend this book for leisure reading.
2,Too much bedroom descriptions,"I've read other books by Phillipa Gregory and like them, but I was very disappointed in this one. I love British history but this one contained too much focus on the sexual explorations of the main characters. Okay, I know Mary Boleyn had affairs, but I honestly don't need to read about how the king excites her nor about she and William sneak off every chance they can to have sex all night long. I don't need to hear descriptions of sexual intimacy that includes everything but ""doing the deed."""
1,Gave a complete new meaning to the term literary license.,"I read this book at the behest of a friend. She said it was wonderful, and how she could not put it down. I could not put it down either, but that is just because I wanted to finish it as fast as I could to end up the torture. I found the fictional part all over, but in it's 672 pages the only historical part I was able to find were some names of people and places. I have read several books about Tudor England, and I would love to know where she got her sources, since she seems to be the only person to have come up with this theory. I wonder why!"
4,Great Book,"This book was a page turner! I couldn't put the it down. If you love historical fiction, then this book is for you."
5,"Loved it, sad it had to end!","I am such a huge fan of Phillippa Gregory -- and this book started it all. This historical fiction is exceptionally well-researched, and keeps you caught up in the sexy drama of the relationships between Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn & her sister Mary Boleyn, while offering some insight to the powerful family leaders trying to influence the king. Offers a beautiful feel for the period. Even though you know what's going to happen to Anne, it's a joy to read, and I hated for this book to end!"
2,Abridged Audiobook Review,"This abridgement completely butchers the book. I have never before experienced an abridgement that left out so much important information and that was this choppy. Although the reader is quite good, I can't recommend this form of this book."
5,The Other Bolyne Girl,"If you like historical fiction, this is a ""must-read"". You can't put it down once you get started."
3,"Not sure, maybe, kind of...","I don't think I liked this book as much as the others that Gregory has written. It was from the point of view of Mary Boleyn. She was shown as a whinny and almost immature woman, being over shadowed by her evil sister, Anne. We all know that Anne Boleyn was an incredibly awful woman. She was power hungry and had almost no soul, so there was nothing for Mary to be except for the obedient sister. I don't care if there are people that disagree with me, all I know is that the book wasn't very historically accurate on Mary's part, but was spot on on Anne's. I love Philippa Gregory and will continue to read her books on the dangerous life in the court of Henry VIII."
3,"Good story, OK writing","Gregory's story reads quickly, it is really enthralling and entertaining, but it is not that well-written. Not to mention, at times it is like a ""bodice-ripper"" Harlequin novel -- the sex scenes were surprising and prevalent. In my opinion, it is a light ""beach read"" and not a serious work of literature, but enjoyable nonetheless."
5,What a great read!,"Don't be deterred by its length, The Other Boleyn Girl is a worthwhile read. With this novel, the reader gets history, mixed with drama and adventure. As a reader, you grow to have true feelings for these characters, while you might know what historically happened to them.A fine novel!"
5,Stunning!,I had given up on finding any more books that suited my liking. After reading this novel I became obsessed with obtaining the rest of the Philippa Gregory works. I'm currently reading The Queen's Fool and The Virgin's Lover at the same time. They are fabulous books and brought me back to reading. The politics are exciting as well as the love stories that made history.
3,the other boleyn girl,This is an easy read....great for summer beaches or tired minds. It is a bit trashy. I expected more history outside the bedroom.
3,3.5 stars is more like it...,"I am actually a bit torn between a 3 star and 4 star rating on this one. I enjoyed the book and thought it was at least an interesting picture of sibling rivalry. I loved that it took a different sort of look at this time in Henry VIII's court. But I felt that the characters were a bit vapid--especially Mary, who seemed to change her mind depending on which way the wind was blowing. Still, the novel as a whole was fairly historically accurate and did keep me interested, even though of course I knew how it would end--at least for Anne."
4,Really good read,"I have never read historical fiction, but when I saw this coming out as a movie I decided to read the book first. It was a really good book and made me want more. I am now reading more Philippa Gregory novels."
5,A brief review and account of reading experience,"I read this book twice. Each experience was rich, and in the end of each serving, I remebered the mood from the story and it stuck with me. I'd have to say I quite admire the stubborn spirit of 'nan bullen' and also the wisdom of her sister, mary.Not only is this book detailed historically, it serves for an excellent experience. As an avid reader, I am usually going on from one book to the next. This book, however, proved to be worth a second read AND one of the most cherished it my library collection. If ""nan bullen"" still lived, (impossible nonetheless)I would thank her. Thankyou, Nan, for teaching me ambition and flirtation!**** GRUDGE WHO GRUDGE"
4,a bit of history!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book . It has all the elements of a good romantic and historic novel .Excellent story telling , you just want to keep turning the pages for more drama and excitement.It was so nice to immerse yourself in another time in history."
4,Good book..,"The story is a fascinating one and Ms Gregory has breathed life into all the characters for me. It's made me hungry for more. I've trawled the web these last couple of days reading everything I can find on the Tudors. My existing knowledge of Henry VIII was limited to schoolgirl history and I only wish I'd had this book, back in the day when History was on my timetable. You know it's a good book when you seek out any little bit of info on the web that relates to the story you've just read.I'm really amazed though, at the negative reviews here, which site 'inaccuracy' as the reason to give 1 or 2 stars. It's a work of fiction. The characters were real people, but Historical Fiction is just that - Fiction in an Historical setting.I can't believe people are saying it's a terrible book because it's not 100% accurate. It's fiction. If anyone is looking for 100% Historical accuracy, perhaps a work of non-fiction would suit better?As a work of fiction, it's a good book."
5,more than your normal historical fiction,"This novel is so JUICY! It was reccommended to me by one of my best friends who is a history buff, so i had my reservations about reading it at first, thinking that it would be a bunch of facts thrown together with a simple plot - But as soon as i picked up this monster of a novel, i could not put it down!the relationships are intricate and the characters are fascinating... overall a really great read."
4,a historically based pleasure-read,"This is one of those fastpaced ""can't put it down"" novels. I have heard several people complain about the historical inaccuracies within the novel. However, if you can put those aside and accept the book's universe as Gregory unfolds it, it is a joy to explore. If you enjoy historical fiction and are interested in Tudor England, I would highly recommend reading this book."
1,"So, so very bad","I had just finished reading ""The Autobiography of Henry VIII: With Notes By His Fool, Will Somers"" by Margaret George and was interested in learning more about about that time. A group of acquaintances heartily & gushingly recommended ""The Other Boleyn Girl"".Fortunately, my copy came from a thrift store, because I cannot finish it. I'm not even at page 75 yet and I'm seriously hating it. The most eye-rolling passage for me was Mary's description of her stay at her family's country estate all by herself (with the exception of the servants), and her discussions with local farmers, plus the story about how she secured seed for a crop for some of them. Please.If Ms. Gregory is the feminist she claims to be, she would do well to write more accurately about history and and less sensationally. The truth is usually much more interesting anyway.I'll be combing these 1 and 2 star reviews for recommendations of better accounts of the time and of Anne Boleyn."
5,THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL,"Marvelous, fresh version of the Anne Boleyn episode of history, narrated by her younger sister, Mary. I found myself totally caught up in the story, even though I've read and seen many versions of the tale of Mary's sister Anne, Henry the VIII's second wife. I had a difficult time putting the book down and could not wait to get back to it. The times and lifestyles are so clearly dileneated that I felt part of them."
3,a new look at mary,Throughout the centuries Mary Boleyn has been portrayed as either a simple little ... who was too easy going to go for the crown or as a helpless victim. This book goes a long way toward making you see Mary as something else. Is this the real story? Perhaps or perhaps not. This is historical FICTION afterall. The real Mary not only outlived her brilliant siblings but managed to find marital happines. It's a fascinating story and well told. My favorite Boleyn book is The Concubine by Norah Lofts. This book definitely deserves to sit on the same shelf.
4,The Other Boleyn Girl,"Although the author uses overused descriptions of sexual desire and at times the novel is suggestive of a tabloid romance, this is a fascinating fictionalized history. It graphically portrays the repressed role of women during the reign of Henry VIII, and brings that entire era into colorful 3-D. I read all 660 pages in one week and could barely put it down to go to work. This was my first book by this author and it has spurred me on to read others."
5,A fascinating glimpse of history,"...but an even better story of a girl's journey to womanhood. Philipa Gregory's Mary Boleyn was a three dimensional character who sprang to life in the pages of the book. Mary Boleyn was her family's pawn, married off at an early age and tossed in the king's bed shortly thereafter. But as the story unfolds, Mary finds herself and finally has the strength to marry for love.Gregory's ability to weave a fictional story into a historical work was breathtaking."
4,A Very Good Read,"This is an excellent story for fans of the Elizabethan Era. It gives the story of Anne Boleyn's rise to power and explains how Mary Boleyn is comanded to become the King's mistress at the pushing of her very amibitious Howard family and watches as her own sister steals away her lover and the father of her children. It gives a very human view to a story about two sisters, one considered a mistress to the King of England and the other the girl who insisted upon marriage before allowing the King in her bed and ends up dying on a scaffold with all of England declaring her a witch. It is a very easy and enjoyable read."
3,Why does everyone describe Anne as a munipulative shrew?,"This book was ok. A good read if you are looking to fill up time, but not somewhere you want to go looking for valid historical information. However, once again Anne is portrayed as a spoiled gold/power-digger, as usual. I wish someone would say something nice about her!!!"
2,"not your feel-good romance, prepare for some disturbing behavior","I devoured this book in two days. The author's writing style compels you to keep turning pages...you have to find out what (usually awful) It is kind of like seeing roadkill, you want to look away, but you just have to find out what the heck that thing was... I found the book to be somewhat disturbing in several parts. When I got done, I felt satisfaction at being finished with it, but unable to really recommend it to anyone in that it really was depressing to follow all the characters through bad choices and the farce of their lives. I think the author is a very talented writer - but I didn't care for the storyline."
5,One of the best books I've read in a while,"The story of Henry the VIII is so convoluted that it can be hard to believe it actually happened. Based on historical facts, with the dramatic flair and touches of a true fiction novel, Gregory does a wonderful job bringing everyone back to life and depicting the relationships and situations that made Tudor England so memorable."
5,A Very Good Read,"Being a junkie who loves to read about British nobility, I have found some books on the subject to be big yawners, much like college text books, but not this one. Philippa Gregory has a wonderful perception of the lives of her characters, which is evident in her writings. They have become more alive for me than with any other author.I would highly recommend this book and am looking forward to reading the others she has written."
2,Mary at Anne's expense,"Judging from other reviews, this book seems to fall into either the ""love it or hate it"" category. As an ardent Anne fan I was naturally disappointed in it but I can understand why others were not. It is a good plot read and gives a new spin on what is ultimately the story of Anne rather than Mary Boleyn. However, I also noted a lot of historical mistakes - the least of which was a complete omission of Mary's scandalous past in France - and the writing style was just left of bad romance novel. I recommend a much earlier Anne book called ""Brief Gaudy Hour"" by Margaret Campbell Barnes."
2,Surprised by other positive reviews,"I must say that I am really surprised with the overwhelming positive reviews of this book. I am an avid reader, particularly of historical fiction. This novel felt like a Harlequin Romance novel to me. While I did not learn much about the time period in which it was set, I did learn quite a bit about how to seduce my husband! So, depending on your interests..."
1,Utterly sleep inducing.,I just don't see what the big deal is. I received this book as a gift and sat down to read it one night. It nearly put me to sleep so I set it aside and decided to come back to it the next day. Same thing happened. The story is slow moving and I found myself skipping ahead to see if it got better. It didn't. I would not suggest this book to anyone.
2,I Already Knew the story,"I have to admit, I usually do not like historical fiction...this book was no exception. I read half, and read the end because it was boring....."
1,Disappointing is an Understatement,"If you're looking for well developed characters, thoughtful dialogue, or intellectual stimulation, don't pick up this book. The Tudor period is fascinating and offers all you need for a gripping plot. The story itself is quite intriguing when written about by others. Despite hearing rave reviews, I found Philippa Gregory's prose to be poorly constructed and incredibly irritating. I wasn't bothered by the historical inaccuracies; after all, it is a ""novel"" and many of the facts are debatable.If you want a long read on par with a Harlequin Romance (actually, those are better), then this would be a perfect fit. I would have given ""0"" stars if I could have."
4,Entertaining,"Phillippa Gregory is one of my favourite authors when it comes to historical fiction, and she lived up to my expectations in this book too, I didnt know much about Henry VIII and the tudor period before I read this book, and I feel like I got a bigger knowledge now about that time. I like when books can make me feel something like happiness, anger, sadness etc. and this book managed to do that."
5,the other Boleyn Girl,"I really liked the book. It is a story that is a romanticized account of history. She uses actual bits of history, but fills in the time in between with fiction. I thought it was very entertaining, I would recommend it and I would read her other books."
3,As long as you don't know what really happened,"This book held my attention and was a pleasant, though very undemanding read.Gregory tells it in the first person, in the voice of Mary Boleyn, Anne's older sister.I give Gregory credit for making money from this and for thinking of a different angle from which to tell Anne Boleyn's story.The book is 664 pages long, but in spite of that Gregory has left out nearly all the meat of the story. Queen Catherine's resolute resistance is not recounted. More and Fisher and the terror of The Act of Succession get two paragraphs. Wolsey's key role and tragic fall are barely mentioned.The scurrilous rumors of George Boleyn's perversions are taken as fact and are given as motivation for much of the endgame. Anne's loss of the 2nd baby is not connected to Henry's fall from the horse.There are myriads and myriads of departures from the known facts. However, if you don't know any of the facts going in, you would find this a perfectly acceptable book."
4,good,The payment was done quick the shipment was good and the book was the as they described. I am very happy
5,Awesome,"This is the first book in the series ofthe Boelyn girls that I was referred to.I liked it so well, I have since readthe others!"
3,Story is good but not the history,I like this story as a story. It entertains and keeps me reading. As a book that is suppose to be about history though it isn't as good. I'm no history student but I know enough to know alot of what is put in this book is made to sound more important than it is in terms of Anne herself. Many of the rumors and such.The characters were interesting and except for a few places that got a little slow the story moved along pretty good. I can say it was a good story but not great because I kept feeling like the writer was making so much of it up that it was messing with the real people of history too much. I know its fiction but even so I think a writer should only go so far in making up the stuff no one can be certain about.So its a good and entertaining story but not enough real history that it kept me feeling that most of what I read was invented by the writer.
5,the Other Boleyn Girl - Better than the Movie!,"I initially picked up this book because I loved the movie. I immediately realized that this powerfully written book far eclipsed the movie. Set in the court of Henry VIII, this is the intriguing story of the Boleyn Girls, Anne and Mary. The characters come to life as they fight for the King's affection and advancement of their family. I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction."
5,The Ofher Boleyn Girl,"This book captivated me. Although, this book is a fiction, it provided historical information on the wives of Henry VIII. The Tudor dynasty has intrigued me throughout the years and this book gave me information which I did not know and it provided a wonderful novel to read. I truly enjoyed it. My next will be The Boleyn Inheritance, which I understand is as good a read."
3,Fun Read,"So, with the Tudors on DVD and the newest Elizabeth movie out, I'm looking for an Elizabeth meets Mean Girls movie when this one comes out. The book was entertaining, told from the point of view of Mary, Anne Boleyn's shallow and clueless sister, and details the rise and fall of her family's place at Court. Both Mary's dalliance with the King and the snare of the King by her sister Anne, and Anne's fall are the setting of this fluffy romance novel."
4,The Book is better than Movie,"I typically don't read these kinds of novels, but this one kept my attention. Gregory's writing style is excellent. She gives what is an ordinary history lesson a fascinating look into a world of intrigue and deception. I'm now hooked on her style of story telling and have started reading the first book of her trilogy, ""Wideacre"", and again, I'm not dissappointed. BTW - I saw the movie (the Other Bolyen Girl).... read the book, it's better."
3,"Interesting Story, Poor Style","This book shows lots of possibilities, but while I am reading it I am distracted by her poorly written tag lines in her characters' dialogue, and her sex scenes are too graphic for my taste. She leaves little to the readers' imagination. Regarding the tag lines, she uses far too many adverbs, such as ""Anne said desperately"" or ""he said staunchly."" In some cases, they are repeated on several different pages. Such -ly adverbs should have all been edited out, except for the ones which concern the volume of a characters' speech (e.g. ""He said softly"" is acceptable, because ""softly"" cannot be shown by a character's body language, etc., whereas emotions can. In short, simple ""he said's"" and ""she said's"" should have been all she used. Adverbial tag lines are distracting."
3,Gripping tale,"A quest for power. Three siblings who resent, compete against, and yet love one another in a twisted one. The retelling of the story of Anne Boleyn, her sister Mary, and Brother George, and how the quest for power made them enemies and ultimately ended in Anne's premature death. Gripping tale with new insight into an old historic story.Reviewed by Janet Sue Terry author of the Set Me Free Series -Possibilities and Resolutions. President of Just My Best Book Publishing Company. www.janetsueterry.com"
5,Couldn't stop reading!,This book is great! I love all of Philippa Gregory's books but this one was just amazing. I was having a hard time putting it down! She did a wonderful job at taking you into the time of King Henry's court and making you feel that you were actually there listening to the conversations and watching all of the scandal unfold before your eyes. I recommend this to anyone!I am a BIG fan of Anne Boleyn. I actually make Anne Boleyn jewelry based on pieces she wore on the tv show The Tudors. [...]
2,a cheap trashy romance novel,"My friend gave me this book since she knew I liked historical novels. Let's get one thing straight. This is a fictional account on some historical and empirical facts. So with that in mind, this book is nothing else but a harlequin romance novel. If you enjoy this genre, then you will like this book."
4,Enjoyable historical fiction from the Tudor era,"Most people have heard of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII who was infamously beheaded when she failed to bear him a son (and whose daughter, Elizabeth, went on to become a great monarch). But few are aware that prior to Anne's rise, her sister, Mary, was the King's mistress and allegedly bore him two children. This novel seamlessly blends fact and fiction to tell the story of the Boleyn family, whose ambitions and aspirations caused them to put two daughters in harm's way. However, the story centers around the rivalry between the two sisters as well as their relationship with their brother, George Boleyn, who was executed just prior to his sister. A captivating tale about this fascinating period of history."
1,Shouldn't history be somewhat correct?,"I only have to say this, historical facts can be correct, and still have good or even better fiction. Anya Seton proved that, with Katherine. Fact it seems, as in Elizabeth 1, if studied, is far far more interesting than any fiction made to soup up a book or even film. Philipa Gregory blurs truth and makes it sad, for I rate the book as well as the movie next to nothing.J. Schossow"
1,cheap romance posing as historical fiction,"Clearly, I'm in the minority here, and I did only read 112 pages, or the first two chapters.Abominable. Painful in its lack of subtlety or craft.The language of the book does nothing to evoke the 16th century. At one point, the main character practically says ""Whatever!"" (I forget her actual comment, and I'm not going to torture myself by turning on my Sony PRS to search for one line in a crummy book.)It should be a good movie. It clearly goes for the gusto with sex and intrigue, but that's all it has: enough to float a movie for 90 minutes, but I've already wasted one afternoon on the book, which is more than it deserves. I enjoy a sexy film as much as the next girl, but I'm not going to spend hours reading this vapid tale."
1,Fantasy,"This book may be fine as a fantasy, but I feel it is ridiculous to rewrite actual people's lives and rewrite history just for a buck. Much of this book is a complete fabrication, and I am afraid many will take this book as factual. Now it's a movie so even more people can be misguided."
2,lower your IQ,"The book reads like it was written for a fifth grade reading level. If this doesn't bother you, then maybe the immature character development will. The characters are all so wooden. Anne is the conniving, overly ambitious coquette and her sister Mary is the unwilling courtier who longs for the country. To the author: I get it already! How many more pages are you going to repeat this theme? Dialogue and plot are so repetitive and there is virtually no character development. I was just looking for an entertaining historical fiction piece written with some sophistication for adult readers. If you're really desperate, stuck in a hotel room on your vacation, then this book may do."
2,Decent enough fiction -- don't mistake it for history,"This is a light read -- two dimensional characters and a heavy dose of anachronism -- and it's easy to get sucked into believing this is ""as it was."" But this is NOT an accurate portrayal of Anne Boleyn. In fact, I couldn't help but feel a little depressed at how such an educated, passionate, courageous, ahead-of-her-time woman was treated in this novel. Gregory's portrait is of little more than a pathological sadist bent on achieving her goals at all costs. Talk about subtle characterization -- the author practically slaps you in the face every other page with the sibling rivalry theme! Anyone wishing to learn the truth about Anne after should check out Eric Ive's biography -- and in the meantime take this for what it is: Fiction."
4,Very enjoyable...,"Just finished and I could go back and read it again. Ms. Gregory truly 'gets' the era, history and nuances of court life and brings to life how it affects each character."
5,Rich and sumptuous.,If you loved the other books by this author you will love this one. A definite page turner. I strongly reccomend it!
4,Great Book from King Henry VIII's time period!,"Not only is this a great book, but I was intrigued by the author's use of Mary (Anne's sister) as the narrator. I love reading historical books about King Henry VIII and his court, and have never before seen a book written from the perspective of Mary Boleyn."
3,Another dificult life,"Well written about a very difficult time to be alive. If you please the righ people, your life is ok. Fall out of favor and you're sunk. Good history."
4,"Great story, not historically acurate","So the Other Boleyn Girl is really well written, as soon as you start off the book the details are great and it just draws you in like a hook, Gregory really hit the nail on the head with the story itself, I really liked her little twist on George and his irritation with girls :)Though the historical details are extremely inaccurate, but if you don't mind the historical inaccuracies then this book is for you. This book follows mary Boleyn, by the way, not anne. I got this book due to the fact that I watched the movie and thought it was about Anne, also it shows mary in a much nicer light then what she really was."
4,Good,"This book arrived in a a little slower then I thought in fact had kinda forgot I order it, but since I was not in a rush it was not a huge problem. Arrived as said in good shape. Book had no wear,tears or markings."
5,One the best books I've ever read.,"I can't say much except that this is one of the best books I've ever read, hands down. I can read it over again and again and feel like I'm actually living during this time period and understand the author trying to captivate my emotions. It's a truly brilliant novel. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!"
5,"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!!","Okay, so while you may not use this novel as a reference while writing a paper on English history, if you need a book that will keep you enthralled you have most certainly found it.The Boelyn family wants nothing more than to elevate themselves within the English social hierarchy. As players in the court of Henry VIII from a very young age, siblings Anne, George and Mary know how to play the game well. When young Mary catches the eye of the King while at court, the family, under the guidance of their ruthless uncle, meet to determine how to best use Mary to further the family's social agenda. What follows is a thrilling tale of love, murder, betrayal and sibling rivalry. Descriptions of the English court and the actions within will keep readers immersed and interested. The horrific exploitation of women and children and the social acceptance of it all is both riveting and nauseating. An excellent piece of historical fiction, not to be missed.DYB"
3,Unusual book,"My interest in Tudor history began with the PBS series on Henry and Elizabeth I many years ago. Since then I have read many books on these figures. Although little is actually known about Mary Boleyn, Anne's sister, this book told a very believable story of Mary and her family. It incorporated both rumor and historical fact in such a way that I forgot it wasn't necessarily accurate. A nice departure from the typical books by Weir, etc, which although interesting, don't capture the same feeling of ""being there"" that this book does."
3,Cute but inaccurate,"This was a nice read. I'll admit that.However, there are many factual errors in this story, the most memorable being that Anne has suddenly become older than Mary. (In reality, it is believed that MARY was indeed older than Anne.)I would recommend this book for those who are interested more in entertainment than history. Also, for a parental warning there are some fairly... suggestive (and NOT ambigous)... references in this book."
5,Awesome!,"I loved this book. Bought it on a whim, I was in the mood for it for some reason, although I've never enjoyed historical fiction before and have never wanted to read it. After a few pages I was hooked and can't stop reading her other novels. I hate history, but this book got me interested in this time period and I can't get enough. It was very interesting, a real page-turner. It made me feel smarter for reading it. I can't compare her with other historical fiction authors because I haven't read anyone else yet. I have to get through all of Gregory's stuff first, then maybe I'll try others. But I truly truly loved this book. So far, my favorite of all of her novels."
4,Absorbing and delightful,"I wasn't very familiar with the Tudor period and knew little about Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII, but this book had me engaged from the first page and was a fast read despite the 600+ length. From the characters and wardrobe to the activities that took place within the Royal Court, the author's descriptions were vivid and well detailed. Not being an historian, the book left lingering questions about the era that made me want to buy the text books. I disagree with one reviewer who said the book wrongly blames Anne Boleyn and is degrading to women. Gregory equally portrays King Henry as childish, selfish and incapable of truly loving someone other than himself. This book is ""degrading"" to those who put greed and ambition above love and virtue. This may sound harsh, but I found myself despising Anne Boleyn's character so much that I secretly delighted in knowing her fate ..."
4,A Fast Read,"I breezed through this book and I found it a great read. I had a hard time with some of the stuff, like being married at twelve and the beheading, however, I enjoyed the view point from so long ago and how very difficult women had it. I have leant this book out and haven't gotten it back!"
4,Really Fun Read,"I am a grad student in european history and loved this book. Of course, it is not totally historically correct; as pointed out, Mary is the older sister, not younger, and Henry was born before her daughter. But the impression of romance - correct, from what historians can tell, is true about her marriage with William, her second husband. They did live happily ever after, as far as one can tell. Story, while a long book for some, I read in two sittings and will read again. What a great movie this book would make!"
2,The Other Boleyn Girl,"The Other Bolyen Girl was okay. But it had a lot of historical problems. First of all it has Anne as being Mary's older sister, but really its the other way around. It also has Anne as this horrible person, when she wasn't. It has Anne stealing Henry from Mary and wanting to be Queen, but Anne never wanted this. All Anne wanted was to marry Harry Persy. Also it has an actual affair between Anne and George which NEVER happened. Also the sexual scenes are too much in the book. Tell me they had sex, but don't tell me every little detail! Other than all the wrong stuff about Anne this book was okay. WARNING! Do not read this book if you don't want to hear all about other peoples problems and how they made themselves the victim!"
3,Disappointed,I am very disappointed as i have not recieved my purchase which was orderedon 5/11/10.It t is to late now for me to post to the Uk.Cant rate it as not recieved it yet! CJ Venour.
2,Kindle eBook more expensive than print copy,"I couldn't put this book down. It's a real page turner and kept me up til 3 am trying to finish it before I had to go to sleep. Full love/drama which is what I love about this one.While I found this book to be an excellent read, I am disappointed in the pricing. The Kindle eBook edition is $12.99 while the print version is only $10.88. eBooks cost essentially nothing to distribute, so why the eBook version costs more baffles me. This price difference made me so angry I refused to purchase this eBook or the print version and give the publishers money for ripping me off. I borrowed the print version of this book from a friend instead."
5,Two thumbs WAY up,"Having never read historical fiction before, I was marveled by Gregory's work. I started it wondering if it would grab me enough to hold me for 600+ pages. Instead, I found I was drawn to this book like practically no other - every spare moment I had was spent reading it and I finished it in under a week. Gregory spins her tale seamlessly and enchantingly and her book has piqued an interest in Tudor England that I never would have had otherwise. She made every character spring to life and I felt like I was inside those courts everytime I opened the book."
3,"Mirror, Mirror on the wall...","I decided to read this book because it was recommended to me by a friend. The plot mirrors the title of ""the Other Boleyn Girl"" by telling the fictional account of Anne Boleyn's sister, Mary.I found that the plot developed quite slowly. The book was good, however I feel that it could have been cut quite a bit shorter than it was. I did like the different perspective from which it was written, but overall, the plot was very circular, and lacked any suspense. I felt as if I knew exactly what was going to happen throughout the whole novel, and for the most part, I did. This novel does a good job at aligning the fiction with the fact, but I think it could have been done better. I am kind of indifferent towards this book. I do however, recommend that if you start it, you finish it."
1,Bad Tudor Porn,"If OK magazine and Penthouse had been writing in the 1500's this is what they would have come up with.First, it is a badly written book. It is essentially bad Tudor porn. No characters are well written, and they are all insufferable. Honestly they couldn't behead Anne fast enough for me. Even Mary, who should have been the heroine/likeable one was a winy, annoying character.Second, if you're going to make it up just call it fiction and don't try to pass it off as history. Do some basic research. If I can refute the basic ""facts"" of your book in 5 minutes with Google, it's not history in any sense of the word.This book does not deserve to be a best seller, she does not deserve to be identified as an historical fiction writer. I look at author recommendations on books, and if she recommends it I put it down and move on."
1,What a Disappointment !,"Such a dissapointment , a true waste of money, it was clearly not a historic novel , nothing, nothing, nothing worth reading. I agree with a previous review, two-dimensional characters , the too-innocent Mary, the too-evil Anne, the too-merry George...It also annoyed me the detailed reference to sex , which was NOT adding any valuable information about the plot. I was misled from the previous good reviews, but now i know better...I read it, I always read the books I buy, but I was so frustrated, never again this writer. NEVER"
2,Trashfest!,"I decided to read this book because I was really interested in seeing the movie. I did not know much about the history of the Tudors nor Anne Boleyn. But I could tell right away by reading this book that the author, Philippa Gregory is extremely biased towards Anne Boleyn. She's turned her book into a critique of how women, such as Anne, who are struck by ambition into some kind of incestuous monster who is ready to push anyone out of her way. To me, there are two types of books: page turners and books that move very slowly but have a lot of substance. The Other Boleyn Girl is the latter. I kept reading this book because I have this unwavering commitment to finish a book, hoping that the end will somehow redeem this craptastic fest of trash. This book really teeters on the border of a trashy romance novel. I will never read anything by Gregory again."
2,too much romance for me,II will admit first of all that I did not finish this book. I had never read a book by Philippa Gregory and since I like historical fiction I thought I would give her books a try. I have never been a fan of romance so that might be why I found this book light on the history and heavy on the romance. It was just not my cup of tea.
4,The Other Boleyn Girl,"Read the book in one seating. Fiction, non fiction and history all thrown together; how great."
3,"OK for a flight or a beach, but....",there's a child-like innocence or simplicity in the writing-style that really irritated me more and more as I read this.
5,GREAT views,"I have always had problems with binoculars, and I always figured it was because I had a vision problem in one eye and that must have affected my viewing through the tubes.WRONG!I had just been too cheap to but good binoculars. I bought these for my wife, and I could not believe that I could actually use them as well. These are great for all purposes. We both love them, I need to get another pair!!"
5,I'm used to Walmart Clearance rack stuff....,"It's only been the last 7 years or so that I've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house, I admit I used to be walking around in my underwear when I woke up in the morning! All of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks, and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth.I bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart. I have to say that although I hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe, when it got here and I wore it for a couple days, I really like it.I bought the Large Black robe; I'm 6ft, about 200lbs, a little heavy around the middle, and the robe fits pretty well. The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist. The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs. It ""flows"" nice too, when I walk, not like the heavier terrycloth robe. And the silk lining makes me feel ""rich""!Overall, I like it!"
5,Hefner aint got nothing on me!,"Wow I am completely impressed with this robe. I bought the silver/grey robe, and one big thing to note is that the picture just doesn't do it justice. The outside fabric (mainly wool) has a pattern that is hard to explain but looks very sharp. The seams are silk and really accent the robe in the right way. The inside of the robe is smooth silk and the entire robe is not heavy or light its right in the middle. I bought the medium size and it fits perfectly. I am 5'10 and the waist/arms were a spot on fit. Kudos on the fast shipping as well to Amazon!"
2,The long and short of it.,Not since man began to walk upright would a robe with arms as long as these fit anyone not under contract to the NBA.Jerry
3,"""Could Have Been Better""","The movie was okay. If you like movies from the 70's, then this is another flick to add to your collection. Tamara Dobson is definitlyone tough sista."
3,"stylish, but not worth owning","Cleopatra Jones could have been the next James Bond with more funding. Sadly, all there was to work with was a Bat Man car and a fairly nice city apartment. This movie is sort of low budget, and not even cheezy at that. If you want to see a cheezy (...) film as mimicked in MAD TV's Dolemite and the (...) Cane, this is not the one to watch. This just is not a movie that can be enjoyed legitamately or made fun of. It's just sort of boring with a few flourishes of color and and action. Coffy has a cheezy battle seen at the end, though."
2,For Blaxploitation fans only,"If you liked the trashy Blaxploitation films of the 70s, you'll love this. If you're like me and hate this junk-filled genre, it ain't for you.Bad acting (especially Shelly Winters and the ubiquitous Antonio Fargas), overdone story (main character getting revenge for framing by the (of course) racist crooked cops), ad nauseum. Good for laughs, but not much else.However, there are some redeeming features that raise this from one starts to two for me. Bernie Casey comes off as a very sincere and redeeming character who tries to rid th eneighborhood of drug abuse. Cleo Jones herself shows that women can be smart as well as sexy (though she's not quite as charasmatic as Pam Grier's characters and Pam's a better actress). But in either case, this is one of those films best watched with a bunch of your friends over and a cooler filled with beers nearby."
5,Classic Cleopatra,"So many use the word Diva to describe the movie and recording stars of today. Well that last time I checked in the dictionary the word Diva had Tamara Dobsons picture by it. I saw this film the first time in the early seventies and I still think it was ahead of its time. Shes awesome to look at, has martial arts down to a science. I think an updated version would be a great vehicle for Rupaul. Do you agree? Can't wait to get it on widescreen."
4,An Exploitation Classic,"I have decided that exploitation movies are my favorite genre. You don't have to take them seriously, and you can just enjoy their bad writing and over-the-top kick ass mentality. As for the acting, you can enjoy Shelly Winters being laughably shrill, Bernie Casey being ""cool,"" Bill McKinney as a volatile villain, and Antonio Vargas taking over the movie every time he appears. It's a shame Tamara Dobson didn't have much of a career, because as silly as her character is written, she has charisma to spare."
2,Film,My husband wanted to collect a copy of this film. The acting and the story is poor. Quality of the film is good.
3,Too Campy For It's Own Good,"The Seventies were a boon for black action films. On the whole they were riveting but didn't lose sight of their social message and themes of African-American empowerment. The best of the bunch of course were the ""Shaft"" trilogy and most of Pam Grier's output. ""Cleopatra Jones"" is somewhat enigmatic. It purports to expose the scourge of the heroin trade in the inner city. The film, however, resorts to rank stereotype to be taken all too seriously. About the only cliche not present is the drug dealer with goldfish bowl platform shoes. Shelley Winters is particularly annoying as a scenery chomping drug kingpin. The best that can be said about the movie is Tamara Dobson's turn in the title role. Dobson is both elegant and cool in the classic sense. It's unfortunate that she's undermined by the film's far too campy premise."
5,A BLAST FROM THE PAST,"We saw this movie in the seventies and were blown away with Tamara Dodson's presence. I was excited when I found the movie on this site. I am glad we found it because when we need a seventy fix, it right at hand (You won't be disappointed). Outstanding movie. Thanks"
3,Gags and Gimmacks Make for a Spooky Good Time!,"I had not seen this movie for some time and I am a big William Castle fan. I liked the cast, Rosemary DeCamp is always appealing and it was nice to see Marvin Milner push himself towards the dark side. Margaret Hamilton showed her usual brilliance as well. The story was solid but a bit far fetched. I found it difficult to believe that these people would stay in that house after all that had happened to them, no matter what. The gimmick of Illusion-O worked fine and was what one would come to expect from Mr. Castle however, I was disappointed to see that the DVD does not ship with the Ghost Filter as implied. Fortunately, I had some red cellophone and could enjoy the gimmick with great success. Overall, I found the film to be a bit slow but not unsatisfying. Still, it is not up to the likes of Straight Jacket or The Tingler or some of Castles other romps."
4,The orginal.,"As the case with many other old horror films most people see the new one and think the old one's bad too, well I can say this film is far better then it's re make, it has some good jumps, and the classic message of becareful what you wish for."
2,"Fun film, NOT fun without the viewer","Taking into consideration that the film is a classic, what i was rather angry about was the absence of the 'viewer' that was supposed to be included with the dvd. I am inclined to return the dvd to Amazon.com, and suggest those who may want to purchase this dvd to not do so for the reason that i did not get what i paid for."
4,CLASSIC THRILLS AND CHILLS,"The new HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL should also have a credit listing this one as inspiration. It's a perfect atmospheric haunted house chiller that works well on its low budget.A penniless family inherits a house from a forgotten relative. Unfortunately, that particular relative liked to collect ghosts...and they all come with the house.There are several scenes which still hold up well by today standards (the Ouija board among them) and the sound effects are excellently suited for the surroundings.Unfortunately, the transfer from the original effects of the theatrical release leave the ghosts extremely transparent and somewhat hard to make out. Also, the characters in the movie have to put on goofy looking goggles in order to see the spirits.Oh well, you'll still find this film fun. By the way, I forgot to mention the great sense of humor in the script -- as though the film-makers themselves didn't expect this film to be taken seriously. We did."
5,13 Ghosts is Scary & Fun,"Another chilling low budget horror film from William Castle and Robb White. This one has the penniless Zorba family inheriting a haunted house that contains 12 ghosts. They need a 13th to set them free. This has some interesting casting. Margaret Hamilton, who is best known for playing the Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 Wizard of Oz, appears as Elaine, the housekeeper who is also a witch. Very fun movie with real ghosts. It can be scary at times, especially the scene where Sy Zorba is locked in a secret room and sees all the ghosts. The spectre of a butcher with a meat cleaver is frightening. Good family entertainment for a stormy night."
2,A bit dated.,"Some old horror movies are fun--even if they are not what one would call ""scary"" today. This film, however, emerges as a bit of a bore because it lacks style and suffers from a weak, contrived plot. Moreover, what constituted ""horror"" in the director's mind in the 1960's is laughable today. This combination of flaws makes watching this film a chore.Rental only."
4,Good clean fun,Nothing like the remake - good clean fun with 3d glasses.Strange to see the guy from Adam-12 as a shifty lawyer.Funny to see the wicked witch from Wizard of Oz play the spooky housekeeper.Well written and I'm sure the special effects were good for their time.Sets are well made.My daughter loved it! - great scary movie for pre-teens.
3,Missing Viewers,Does not come with the Illusion-O viewers! Hope you have a pair of 3-D glasses at home for this movie's full experience.
5,"Illusion ""O"" is Illusion ""No"" with this DVD,but still a great flick!!!","Okay,like many reviewers have stated,no 3D glasses are given with the product,sort of a letdown(since the DVD packaging said it included a pair of glasses!),but if you can find a pair of 3D glasses sitting around the house,they should do the trick,saying that it's still a nice widerscreen transfer of the film in BOTH Illusion O and w/out Illusio O.The DVD does have some nice supplimentals,just not the darn glasses,guess like William Castle himself,this DVD must have had a small budget,tried to contact Columbia Home Video,but they did not contact me back,oh well,still a great cheesy little horror flick!!! The Tingler(Also from Columbia Home Video) is also good fun too!!! Still very recommended!!!"
5,"Filmed in glorious B/W and in ""ILLUSION-O""","Some folks may consider this movie over the top, over the hill or just lame but I---who saw 13 Ghosts in real time (1960)---considered it the best of the spooky matinee fare of its day. It had a fantastic built up to the climax of the story. All the actors and actresses were top notch. But the true power of this movie was that it filmed in glorious B/W and in ""ILLUSION-O."" You can't beat that combination! And those who are critical of this movie ought to take a time out from their self-imposed and sanctimonious attitude and appreciate it; directed and produced by William Castle himself. They don't get any better!"
3,"13 Ghosts not much scary, not much fun","I bought this film thinking that I would be scared to death and have fun watching it because of the ghost viewers. I thought that was a cool idea. I saw it and it was not scary at all! The ghosts aren't scary and you don't even need the ghost viewers to see the ghosts! Another dumb thing was that the family knew the house had 13 ghosts, but they still moved in and after someone gets attacked, they don't even bother to leave. I was a bit dissapointed. Some ghosts are not even shown! The remake is way better then this one."
4,13 Ghosts Review,"I saw the newer version a couple years ago and never knew that it was a remake. Then I found out that Martin Milner was in it and I knew I had to see it. This was your typical old black and white movie. With the typical dialogue that you would think. But I thought this movie was really funny, i know it's not supposed to be but oh well. Different times during the movie the background would change to blue and then ghosts would appear in red. The problem that I didnt realize when I bought this movie was that you need those 3-D glasses to view the ghosts without straining your eyes. I really liked this movie. It wasnt as scary as the recent one but it was a good horror movie for the 60's."
2,Disappointed....,I've bought two copies of this movie on DVD and each one was missing the ghost viewers. Buyer beware if you buy this DVD....you may get what you pay for or you may not.
4,forget the loud crude remake and see this quite good original,"william castle was one of the best b-movie makers there was(along with roger corman) and this is one of his best. a family inherates a house and finds that it is very haunted and that someone or something wants them out. this is great fun and tounge was firmly ib cheek when it was made. if you like old thrillers,or just cheesey b-movies you will love this one."
2,Disappointing quality,"My 9-year old grandson is really into outdoor adventuring, so I looked long and hard to select some gear for him for Christmas. I was a bit disppointed by the general look of the kit, but the actual gear looked okay. BUT -- the strap that holds the kit onto a belt broke the very first time he tried to put it on! He was so disappointed to not be able to use his new gift right away. I took the case home and re-sewed the strap -- but was not at all happy to have to do so! Since then he's taken his kit with him to his outdoor club and enjoyed using it."
4,Everything is Great but the flashlight,"This Adventure Pak was a great purchase for our 4 year old son. The binoculars feel extremely durable; in fact better than some higher dollar pairs I have purchased for myself previously. The compass is accurate, and has many features considering it's in a inexpensive set like this. The whistle has temperature gauges on the sides, which allow the temperature to fluctuate as your kid blows a ton of hot air through them. Only real complaint is the flashlight. It's super cheap and flimsy. With the reduced cost of LED flashlights now, it would have been the icing on the cake to provide a cheap LED light. Outside of that; the pack is perfect. Would recommend this for anyone considering a set of this nature even for kids up to 8-10 years old."
2,Buy better products separately,"The binoculars didnt work for myself well or the kids. Optics in the lower price range rarely do. The flashlight sucks. The whistle is cheap compared to the orange safety ones you can find in camping supply stores for a few bucks. The compass comes with no instruction valuable to preteen age kids. I cannot find anything nice to say about this kit. Buy your kid something else. Maybe one nice item, with a book on how to use it."
2,"good idea, poor implementation","Poor quality product. Great idea - my daughter was super-excited to get this one, but flash light broke right away, binoculars are not strong at all, thermometer on the whistle does not reflect outside temp-re properly. Very disappointing purchase."
3,Poor Quality,"My 5 year old son received this kit for his birthday. The kit is pretty neat and all of the items do work, but the quality is not what I had hoped it would be. There is a little piece on the bottom of the flashlight that I broke right away. I am not sure what the purpose of the piece was, but my son was really mad at me when I broke it. I thought the batteries went in the bottom and I was trying to open it and broke it instead. Of course, the top screws off of the flashlight so the batteries can be inserted from the top. Also, the loop on the carrying case broke the first time he used it. It doesn't come with a belt, so my son put his belt through the loop which ended up breaking within 20 minutes of wearing it. The elastic loops on the sides of the case are not very tight so I worry the flashlight could slip out. My son is really happy with the binoculars and whistle, so I guess that's what really counts."
2,Saddened buyer,"I thought the shirt would be a good deal. hey.. for 10 bucks, there is not much to lose. The fabric of the shirt is decent. Too bad the shirt comes in 3 sizes larger than what you ordered. Amazon didn't get my order wrong, its just that cacharel makes their shirts very... very... large. But if you've got the body to fit it, you better jump on the deal."
3,Not bad for the price,"As with the other reviewer, I figured, hey, for 10 bucks, I'll give it a shot. The cut of the shirt is stylish and I was generally pleased by the look. The fabric is thin. You will be able to see a t-shirt (white) outline through the material. I wasn't pleased by this but at least it's lightweight...should give the shirt some extra longevity into the hotter months. Another issue I had is that the cut of the shirt is not good for an athletic build. I'm fairly muscular (typically 17 1/2 neck, 36"" arm, broad chest) and I found the shirt to be tight across the back and as a result, the sleeves pull back too far when arms are stretched forward. This will be a problem for people with a big chest or perhaps big belly. Overall, if you have a standard build, I would be happy with this shirt and not hesitate to wear it in a business environment. Given the price, it's a good deal."
4,Nice summer dress shirt,"This dress shirt has been a wonderful summer dress shirt for me as it's nice and light weight. It does wrinkle a little, but water spots (or sweat) seems to evaporate rather quickly and it breathes nicely. It also has nice color and retains nice shape over time.I give it a four as not many shirts attempt to be summery & lighweight, and I imagine this one wasn't intending for that either. It seems to not be quite as nice other dress shirts out there. But it is a nice shirt and I'm often complimented on it when it is worn."
3,"RTFromNC ""rtfromnc"" visit a tailor shop or JCPenney","To the reviewer who couldn't figure out the sizes - I'd suggest you visit a tailor shop or your local JC Penney, Dillards, Sears, etc... The sizes listed on these shirts are standard sizes, reason being that S,M,L, just doesn't cut it - there is your arm length involved there as well. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised that most shirt makes that don't sell at Wallmart, will have this kind of sizing. If you're shy, then google it - there are instructions out there to figure out your size."
5,very inspirational,"My hobby is studying missionaries, especially videos, and this video is the most inspirational video I've watched. It clearly shows the power of God through a humble servant who sacrificed all to lovingly care for the precious people of India. His faithful ministry yielded great fruits! You will be amazed at the ending and his accomplishments."
3,"Useful item, but has Q/C problems.","I purchased this item to install a new stereo in my 2000 Honda Civic. These harnesses make it very easy to interface any stereo with the stock wiring on any automobile without having to modify the wiring on the auto. You use this connector and the connector supplied with the stereo to make an adapter that plugs into the car and your stereo. All the documentation was excellent, but when I tested the stereo, the left rear speaker didn't work. After a little troubleshooting I found that the Green/Black wire on this plug had no continuity between the wire and the pin in the plug. When I removed the pin, I found that the wire had not been stripped before it was crimped into the pin. I was able to fix it but this little Q/C problem added about 45 frustrating minutes to my installation."
1,Not working,"I have the origanal HP black ink cartridge never been refilled also the color I purchased from you, the color refill kit it works fine. the black took in the ink as did the color cartriage, same amount added to both. But the black will only print real light then none at all. refilled again but was full! have to take it out and shake it for it to print dark but that only last about 2 pages!I feel I was ripped off!They said it would work great with the origanal HP cartriages Not So!"
2,"Erratic results, great concept","Foremost, I like the idea a lot and having been using it frequently about a year (been refilling my own cartridges for 8 years). However, the results are inconsistent - sometimes it fills completely and other times it does not (even after repeatedly pressing the pump). My first choice is to try this drip system and let it sit for 2 hours. But I now always check the handy calibrations on the tank. When it does NOT fill, I revert to the manual syringe (yes, messy) filling. The Dataproducts system is quick, but not consistent."
5,Nice,"Great item. Easy to use, I didn't get any ink on my fingers or anywhere else. It really is simple to use. I've used other refill systems, usually just with a needle attached to a squeeze bottle,but this automatic refill system is so much cleaner and simpler. Once your ink cartridge is full the refiller automatically stop putting ink into it. The instructions don't say to, but when finished I put a small piece of tape over the fill hole. Give it a try."
1,don't buy,I have purchased many ink refills and this one turned out to be very disappointing. The ink dries up from the cartridge very quickly and it doesn't print full letters. It was a total waste of my money.
3,Works except for dry cartridges,"Got this to refill a black cartridge and it worked perfectly to start but the ink wouldn't go INTO the cartridge, which had been empty for a while. The instructions say not to let the cartridge dry out. So I guess mine did and thus the refill almost worked. But it is easy and no mess. So I'll keep use it on the next cartridge when empty (right away this time). I would still recommend this refill kit."
5,This was easy,The shipping was faster than I expected. GEAT shipper. At first I thought that this would be complicated and won't live up to expectation from the reviews that I read. Well it was easy once I read the instructions. There was no mess and I din't get a drop of ink on the sink or on my hand. I highly recommend this ink refill kit. Just follow the instructions. I'll be returning to purchase more.ChuckW213
3,Too FAST! Bad Midi Sounds.,The songs are way too fast...it's really hard to keep up on songs like A Lot Of Living To Do and others.And arrangements are pretty cheesy sounding and unrealistic. With the advancements in sounds this seems like something that shouldn't be a problem anymore...but it is for some studios. I wouldn't really recommend unless you have no other option and then I guess it'll do the trick in a pinch.
1,Don't bother,"The third part of this book is devoted to establishing Catholic ""Mary"" as GOD. This is nothing but Catholic propaganda that is absolutely not true. ""Mary"" spews messages calling her followers her children. Let me clarify this absurdity: children of ""Mary"" are not children of GOD.Keep away from these shenanigans. This is a blasphemy."
4,"Clear and concise, but requires supplementation","Griffiths' QM text provides excellent problems and a coherent, though somewhat cryptic, development of the theory. He has a conversational style (also evident in his EM text) that elucidates many of the hard-to-visualize concepts in QM. However, he relies on the use of many specialized techniques to solve problems. If the student is unfamiliar with the mathematical tricks involved, it leads to frustration. I recommend Griffiths' text as the main book in a QM course only if it is supplemented with additional hints (from the professor) on the problems, or with an additional text such as Shankar's or the Eisberg and Resnick work."
4,Excellent Introduction,"I used this book in an introductory quantum class last semester, and found it to be a well-written, easy-to-read, and, perhaps most importantly, lively text. Griffiths deserves to be described by the old term for physicist: ""natural philosopher."" He makes sure to explain concepts using logical, physical arguments and reviews most of the relevant math needed to understand the physics. It's something of a letdown, then, that many of the problems are mere mathematical exercises in tedium. There are many good problems, however, and, on the whole, it's a great book, especially if you've seen quantum a little before, as I had."
3,"Good Book, but not comprehensive","I used this book for a self-study of QM. While it jumps right into the material, it fails to give an intuitive basis for much of what it is covering. I highly recommend Michael Morrison's ""Understanding Quantum Physics: A User's Manual"" as a supplement. Additionally, I don't think Griffiths is correct in postpoining the formal mathematical formulation of QM (i.e. Dirac bra/ket notation, etc.) He glosses over these topics, and he should treat them more in detail earlier in the text so that when a reader sees them in higher level books the transition will be easier."
3,"Well, it's there.","I agree with the above reviews that it is glosses over many major points, and then leaves important stuff to the problems. Many of the problems I found difficult and/or tedious (some of the solutions ran into 5-6 whole pages). Frustrating frankly. Cohen-Tannoudji is much better and complete."
1,A really bad book.,"The book has a few good parts, but there are just too many flaws to grant anything higher than one star. Griffiths leaves many important steps out, sometimes leaving them to the problems or just not covering them at all. Some topics are covered too briefly to be of any help.This book seems to be popular among some students because of his informal writing style, but they should be more cautious. Many professionals I have talked to agree that this is not a good book to start learning QM from. There are many good books out there that you should consider before getting this one (if you have a choice)."
1,Waste of money,"This text is much like Griffith's intro to electrodynamics. If you don't need to learn anything, and just want a simple answer to basic questions, buy this book. If, however, you are taking a class in quantum mechanics, don't waste your money. Griffith brings up interesting questions without ever answering them. He offers no assistance in solving the more demanding problems which would aid the learning process. If you're majoring in physics stay away from Griffith as a whole. Rholf is a much better publisher and writer. Check out his texts if you're serious about an education."
4,Needs more examples!,"While the overall tone of this book is quite engaging, the major flaws are a lack of examples (Dr. Griffiths enjoys having the student figure out things on their own without them) and no answer key."
2,Don't waste your time,"This book is one of the worst texts I have read on the subject of Quantum Mechanics. Griffiths presents the subject in a glib manner presenting the easiest of material in the chapter and leaving the student to drown in problems without a clue of how to proceed. If you ever need to teach yourself Quantum Mechanics, Use the Feynman Lectures."
3,"Easy to read, not that rigorous","I presume the conversational tone of this text makes it appealing to many people; I found it annoying after a while, and I think he uses it to avoid details in many derivations. The notation is not used consistently, the powerful algebraic principles behind QM are introduced in the third chapter and then hardly used again, and likewise the text relies rather heavily on the coordinate representation and on classical arguments. The greatest shortcoming of the text is its brevity: the descriptions of several topics, including matrix mechanics, scattering, and applications, are incomplete, while other topics, such as the Heisenberg representation and the density matrix, are missing entirely. For an undergraduate course, I recommend Liboff, who I think is clearer, more comprehensive, and features some extra goodies such as a brief introduction to the Dirac and Klein Gordon equations."
2,dull as dishwater,"What an uninspired, leaden, workmanlike book. Quantum by the numbers, turn the math handle and crank out the answers. Although this is supposed to be an elementary book, there is more mind-numbing math here that many contemporary Physics majors can handle, and there is much less discussion of concepts than they need. If putting a dead pet on the back cover is friendly, this book is friendly!Goswami's book (now sadly out of print) is much better on motivation, and desn't do as much grind-math. I wish there were a book on Quantum that would break the mold and try to be interesting for today's students, and not just churn out the same old calculations on the same old systems (harmonic oscillator, hydrogen atom, blah-blah). It could have sections on quantum computing, laser trapping... This is not that book."
5,Love it!,"The oil rubbed bronze finish of this floor diffuser is perfect. It is well made compared to the cheap contractor grade one I was replacing and looks spectacular on my tile floor. It dropped in perfectly and matches all the hardware, fixtures, and lighting I also have in the oil rubbed finish. A great addition to my kitchen!"
1,Complete failure,I believe it arrived DOA as the instructions said that it was to have a cotton like top and mine was smooth like icing. Didn't do anything...not one shroom. We followed the directions exactly and even added ice as advise and nothing. It seems like it could be interesting but it's too expensive to be an experiment and they should have something set up to make for easy replacement given that I suspect these have a high failure rate.
4,Northern Exposure,"Like Prefuse 73 with balls; this is the album I wish would have followed ""Vocal Studies..."" Glitchy but never nerdy, hip-hop enough without posturing, a damn near perfect listen aside from the couple tracks with French rappers but what can you do? Dude representsMontreal to the fullest."
3,mesauring up,"I am actually waiting to buy these cans to replace ones from a original kitchen trash drawer system. I have had no luck finding actual measurements for the cans. Can anyone please help. The size I am looking for is approx. 14"" x 10"" by 18"". Thanks."
4,Reliable Container,Just a very functional and durable container for regular and recycled trash. They do eventually get brittle and break at the rim so it is good to know that replacements are available.
2,It did not fit my bin cage,product was fine but it did not fit the bin size for my undercounter installation.I would reccommend more measurements before buying.
1,Where was the editor?,"This book has an interesting plot, but the typos and inconsistencies are very distracting."
2,"I kept trying, but it never helped me.","This pillow was too shallow to hold the baby in the right position for me, and I'm only 5'4"". In fact, having him nurse on this pillow caused him to pull on my nipples, even when he was latched properly, causing me much pain, and cracked and bleeding nipples, until I figured out what was going on.I don't know if you're one of those moms who's got a waist immediately after giving birth, but I wasn't. And, I found that the waist opening was a little too small to accomodate my slowly shrinking baby belly.I wish I had bought a ""Breast Friend"" nursing pillow instead. Its a little bigger and more adjustable."
2,Better for baby than mom,"For all of the positive reviews on this, I didn't find the Boppy all that great. It didn't support my arms as I held my baby and it was more cumbersome than anything when I was trying to feed him. I don't think I would suggest this to other moms, regular pillows you'd find on your couch or bed are easier to get in place than this thing. About all I'll use it for in the future with other children is for the baby to lie in when they're between 0-3 months in age. The Boppy with toys that hang over it might be a good purchase, but this thing does not work well for breastfeeding."
4,Very handy item!,"I find that the boppy pillow is very handy. It is soft and comfortable, our baby loves his. I gave 4 stars bc I found that it was difficult to breastfeed with (awkward). Our dog even loves to lay in the boppy. I recommend this product highly."
5,A must-have for any breastfeeding mother,"When both mom and baby are inexperienced at breastfeeding, the last thing you both need is to be fumbling around trying to get comfortable. The Boppy is just the right fit for everybody and there is no baby product that I used more than this pillow. If you're looking for a practical shower gift, get her the Boppy. Mom will use it 8-10 times a day and take it everywhere she goes!"
2,Luke warm on the Boppy,"I'm not sure what the fuss is surrounding this product and why so many deem it a ""must-have"" I find that a regular firm pillow works just as well if not better. The width of the boppy is too narrow to support a bigger baby. The U-shape isn't especially comfortable to me. The other problem I've had is washing. They come with slip covers now, but if you ever need to wash the pillow itself, it screws up the distribution of the stuffing.I much prefer the My Breast Friend pillow: it has a back support and is adjustable. Very comfortable and gives the baby a wider and flater surface to lay on. Mine is the inflatable version, which is great - when you take off the cover to wash, you can easily clean the pillow beneith with just a damp cloth. My baby also like sitting in it better than the boppy."
5,I couldn't live without a boppy.,"The boppy has been a wonderful purchase. I actually have 2 here in the house, one upstairs and one downstairs. I use them every time I nurse, and my husband uses it when he gives our daugther a bottle. We also have 2 additional boppy pillows that were hand-me-downs. I keep one at each of the grandma's houses so I don't have to cart mine around. I find that the boppy luxe is well worth the additional cost over the regular boppy. The fleece texture and the velvety texture are wonderfully soft. The cover is extremely easy to remove, wash and replace. We purchased an extra cover to rotate with during washing."
3,Awkward for Nursing,"I looked forward to getting the boppy, but trying to nurse with it as a pillow is diffucult as it doesn't fit. No matter how I try to position it, I can't nurse comfortably. The only use I see for this is sitting my infant in."
2,Boppy Overrated,"Another MUST HAVE I was told. I think not. Pillows are much more effective in my opinion to prop up the baby while nursing. The boppy just wasn't comfortable for me, it was too stiff. I didn't feel like it really fit me - and I am not a big woman - size 8 before pregnancy, size 10-12 while nursing. I really think it is overrated and not necessary.I have heard good things about ""my breast friend"" I might try that one next time. But still felt like the pillows did the trick."
4,Perfect!,This is a great product for nursing moms and non-nursing moms also. I bottle fed my daughter and still got a lot of great use out of the Boppy. It was perfect for her to lay in on the floor and great for when she was learning how to sit up.
3,The Boppy is Great,"This has been one of the best items that I put on my registry. It has helped my 5 month old son learn how to sit up, and it has also has been a godsend to my husband when he feeds him, since he had a problem getting him in the right position to feed. Overall, I can say this is a great product. Highly recommend!"
3,Good for holding the baby,"I think this boppy pillow is okay... I mostly use it for support while I hold the baby. My husband uses it for this too. I bought it originally for breastfeeding and found it difficult to stay around my waist (I'm 170 lbs. right now) and difficult to use in general!!! It's just hard to position and a little too bulky for the cradle breastfedding position. It made my baby raise up too high. It also kept slipping away from me. I think it will be nice, when she is a little older, to sit her in it though. We'll see..."
4,Great,I like this pillow. It was very helpful when I was nursing my newborn. The only improvement I can suggest is for the company to stuff it better. My boppy is pretty flat now-a-days from over use.
5,Couldn't have nursed without it!,"The Boppy Luxe was my best friend while nursing. It's fuller and firmer than the regular Boppy. I have a long torso, so it put my son at the right spot for nursing, however a friend of mine said her son was too high to nurse. It's also great for babies with acid reflux or gas who cannot tolerate being on their backs. Some days it was the only place my son could sleep comfortably.I got this as a shower gift and went back and purchased another to keep at Grandma's! It's well worth the $$$!!!!"
4,The best BUT gets too hot!!!,The BOPPY is the BEST although the cotton BOPPY'S are much cooler when you have your baby resting on you. This cloud BOPPY gets WAY TOO HOT. The soft velour feels nice but when you already have body heat this just adds to it.
5,"You should be ""bopped"" if you don't get one","One of the best things created for moms in the last few years. Definitely a must have. It makes breastfeeding so much easier, plus it has other functions like propping baby up and to introduce tummy time. I absolutely love it, and there are so many different designs or covers. Great registry item!"
5,So useful,I love my boppy. So much that we have two for different parts of the house. I use it for nursing and as a seat for my baby. I have been using it recently for tummy time as well. He is 4 months and leans his chest on it as he plays with his toys over the side.
5,"if i coud give more than 5 stars, i would!","i love this boppy, i use it every day. i have two of them so if i stack them and sit my son in the middle, he can sit almost upright and not fall over. he loves this. he also gets tummy time laying on just one of them with his arms over it."
5,A must have!,"I use the Boppy pillow everyday to nurse my seven-week-old son. He fits perfectly on the pillow (the pillow is the right height, length and firmness). When I was at the hospital, they let me use three pillows to sit him on while nursing and he would sink down or start falling off. Pillows just aren't as effective for nursing. The Boppy is also great for tummy time or to help him sit up for a moment. I highly recommend that every mom (nursing or not) get a Boppy pillow, it's a great investment!"
1,Better options avaliable,"I was given this by a friend when pregnant. I was quite excited and even took it to the hospital with me. I hated using this pillow. I am not a big woman at all (5'3 130) but it would not fit in the glider with me comfotably. I did use it to sit on for a while and I used it to help my son sit up when he was learning but if you are looking for a nursing pillow try the ""My Brest Friend"" or my favorite the ""NoJo Nursing pillow"" Boppy just does not live up to the hype."
4,I highly recommend this.,"If you are planning to breastfeed, this is a MUST. I never new how much I'd need the Boppy but I really do. I've tried using pillows to help support my baby while feeding and even tried just cradling him but both were a little difficult and uncomfortable. The Boppy saved my life. My baby is really comfortable on it and he is perfectly leveled to my breast which makes latching on a whole lot easier. Buy it NOW!"
2,"Good for teaching baby to sit up, not good for nursing.","I am not a fat woman, but when I've just given birth to a baby, I'm not a SKINNY woman, either. Boppy Pillows are designed for SKINNY women. If you aren't super-skinny, you will never get that pillow around your waist. If you are skinny, I'm sure this is a great product.I did find my Boppy was useful for sitting my baby inside, as he was learning to sit up. It supports them all around from falling."
1,Buy My Brest Friend instead!!!,"I was given this pillow as a gift and wish I had kept the gift receipt. This pillow slowly moves away from your waist and I was often left with my baby on my lap instead of on the pillow. My back often ached if I didn't prop myself up with enough pillows. The only place I could use it comfortably was in the car. I bought the My Brest Friend nursing pillow myself at the prompting of my lactation consultant and it worked out much better. I could use it on the sofa, at night in bed to nurse my daughter and then easlly place her in her bassinet. The boppy looks nicer but not very functional at all."
1,No good for nursing,"There's so much hype over the Boppy being a ""must have"" that I made sure to get one when our first baby was born. I was very disappointed. It is horribly designed for nursing a baby. The cushion was always slipping and sliding out of position. There is no way to strap it to your waist to keep it in place. For a nursing support pillow, I highly recommend the the ""My Brest Friend"" pillow instead. It's a flat crescent shaped pillow that straps around you and provides lumbar support as well. It made a world of difference for proper positioning, and latching on correctly. If you want a pillow for nursing support, save your money and skip the Boppy."
3,You better off buying the bare naked boppy,"And buying the matching cloud slipcover. I love it because as we all know breastmilk stains and washing the pillow isn't easy. With the bare naked boppy you can find alot of slipcovers to go with your child's room and different stores carry different styles and is so much easier to wash than the whole pillow. I have found different slipcovers at Target, Babiesrus, Target and Baby Depot."
4,This has been a lifesaver!!,"We registered for this item before baby arrived, and thank God someone purchased it for us! In the hospital we had problems with breastfeeding on day 1, day 2 my husband returned with the Boppy Luxe in hand and it has been smooth sailing ever since. When I am sitting our daughter is comfortable, content, and at the perfect height to feed. My husband uses the Boppy when he is cradling her in his arms for extra support. Our daughter if given the chance falls right to sleep in the softness of this product. Other Boppy pillows are cheaper in price, however one of the features all three of us enjoy that is unique to this one is the fleece covering. I would have given five stars, except for the fact that the fit on my waist is not always comfortable in every seating situation. Great product though!"
3,Maybe I'm Rare...But Not as Useful as I'd Hoped!,"When I had my son, I registered for a boppy pillow because everyone told me I HAD to have one - that they were invaluable. Well, I breastfed him for 14 months, and after the first week I gave up on my boppy. I found that it positioned him TOO high, and I was having to lift myself up to reach him. We made do with a simple throw pillow under my arm, and that worked fine for us. I know how popular the Boppy is, but not everyone is shaped the same way."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!!,"I love this product. Infact, I have two of them- one upstairs and one downstairs. They make life so easy when nursing or bottle feeding."
3,For skinny moms only,I use my Boppy for lots of things but it doesn't fit around my size XL waist. It DOES NOT fit all waist sizes as stated. I'd guess that anyone sized 14 and up will have difficulty.Still a great item for propping baby.
2,A disappointment.,"Even though I ended up bottle feeding, I did try breastfeeding while using this pillow. I am not a huge person, but a little larger than average, and this pillow just DID NOT work for me. I tried it every which way I could, and no such luck.My son enjoys it as much as a 3.5 month old can. Even though it clearly tags the product to not use for a sleeping infant, it saved me at times when his reflux was especially bad.If you are a size 14+ you will want to look into a pillow that will fit you better, because most likely, this one will not be as helpful as it is for smaller women."
5,Boppy Pillow not Recalled,"Just read the review that the boppy pillow had a full recall on it. Went looking for more info, ... and there is an impersonator pillow from some boston company that is the culprit... not this one. This is the original one and currently has no recalls on it. This one is ok!"
5,Great Product,"We have used our Boppy for 3 mo's. We don't breastfeed but we still find Boppy to be indispensible. When Isaiah was born, Daddy made a special trip home just to get our Boppy for us to use at the hospital. Everyone loved bottle feeding with it. It has just the right smooshiness for supporting Baby and helps old Mommies and Daddies like us avoid those numb arms and crimped necks. We enjoy it for tummy time and sitting practice, too. During pregnancy, it was a mystery to us when friends told us to register for a Boppy and it seemed expensive but, once Isaiah arrived, we learned very quickly that a Boppy is worth every penny. Other friends have tried the Boppy competitors and not been satisfied. It's hard to believe that the smooshiness, shape, size, fabric type, etc. are so critical but, when you feed a baby round the clock, they are, and Boppy has them mastered."
2,Not for everyone,"I attempted to use the Boppy twice when breastfeeding with no luck. Both my daughter and I were much more comfortable without it. Perhaps it would be better for when I no longer have my ""baby belly"" and need an artificial prop?"
5,Great pillow,"After my c-section this pillow was a godsend; trying to hold a child in the correct nursing position with your abdomen stitched shut can be incredibly painful those first few weeks, especially when they take a few times to latch on correctly. This pillow supports their weight for you so you don't have to. You can also use bed pillows, but my son is now 5 months old and I still enjoy using my Boppy. It still positions my son just right for nursing even though he's grown quite a bit. I definitely recommend this product."
5,A Must Have For All Moms,This pillow is great for breast or bottle feeding. Comfy and soft and big enough to fit around my still swollen abdomen!!! The cover washes easily... I got mine as a gift and would buy one for any mom to be!!!
5,Can't live without my boppy!,"I've had the boppy for my most of my kids. I LOVE IT! When they're newborn, you can use it for breast/bottle feeding, and I could let an older sibling hold the baby by putting this on their lap and the baby on the boppy. Once they're old enough to start trying to sit up, you can prop them up on this. It also helps for tummy time. My older kids use boppies sometimes as pillows while watching tv! Boppies come in a ton of wonderful designs and covers! I Love Boppies!"
5,The BEST invention ever!!!,This was our life saver for our sons first 9 months!!! We used this for ever bottle feeding. Our son was super comfortable and relaxed during feedings. Was especially great those first couple months during the night feedings. I could sit up in bed and feed on this him well I was still relaxed!!! The fleece cover is the best too. Super soft!!! The other covers feel kind of scratchy and are definetly not as soft as this one!!!!
2,Thought it was a must have but.....,"Being quite tall and not petite, this pillow just did not fit well while breastfeeding, it put my son up to high. I had heard all the hype about this product and thought it had to be fabulous, but it just didn't fulfill my expectations. My son is now 4 months old and doesn't even like to be propped up on it for more than a few minutes!"
2,NOT ALL ITS SUPPOSED TO BE,"I BOUGHT 2 OF THESE, BUT NEVER USED THEM. AFTER A C-SECTION I COULDNT PUT IT NEXT TO MY TENDER BELLY AND PLUS IT BARLEY FIT AROUND ME. IM NOT A VERY BIG GIRL BUT IT BARLEY GAVE ME THE SUPPORT I NEEDED TO BREASTFEED. I SWITCHED TO ANOTHER TYPE OF BREATFEEDING PILLOW AND MUCH MUCH BETTER. BIG BABIES AND NOT TEENY TINY WOMAN WILL HAVE ISSUES. MY 7PD BABY BARLEY FIT TO NURSE. WE NOW USE IT AS A TUMMY TIME PILLOW..."
1,"tight fit, and not comfertable","I think it is not comfertable around my waist and I had a 29-30 waist my babys body took the whole thing up and he was 6lb 8oz and 18in.(he was small and so am I) so I was not very happy with it. So I go a different breastfeeding pillow that is just wonderful that I would give a 6 star out of 5 stars, it is red with bears on rocking chairs(I would have prefered clouds on thi one) and it was even cheaper than boppy. also perchaced at babys r us. but everybody is different so try someone elses and see if it works for you. it just wasn't for me but it was for my friend so you never know till you try it yourself."
1,Where is It?,"I placed an order for a new mother on or about August 3, 2006. It was available at the time I ordered it and received this confirmation:Shipping estimate for these items: August 15, 2006 - August 22, 2006Delivery estimate: August 17, 2006 - August 25, 20061 ""Boppy Luxe Nursing and Infant Support Pillow, Clouds""Baby Product; $34.99I received two notifications asking me if I wanted to cancel and constantly delaying shipment.This is now September 18, 2006 and no end in site. I have yet been given a reason why it was showing available at time of order and not not available. I am still waiting."
5,LOVE IT!,This boppy is by far the best! This particular pattern is so soft and beautiful. My daughter looks so comfortable when she lays on it. It is a must have when you feed your little one.
5,The best soft cover boppy around,"Even though this one was a bit more than some of the others out there, it is the most soft! I have talked to other moms who have different ones and they say the fabric isn't soft enough and they need to use a towel on top of it."
3,OK pillow,"I got this pillow to help me position my baby while breast feeding. Well, I'm pretty short, 5'2"", and it positioned my baby way to high to feed comfortably. I guess it would work better for taller people. We got the most use out of it during tummy time. My son hated to be on his tummy, but when we used this pillow, he was able to handle it much longer. We would also use it to prop him up when playing with his airtivity gym. Now he's 5 months old, and we've been using it sometimes to practice sitting. It works OK, but my son has some trouble reaching for his toys because it is snug around his waist. He is a big baby, and is growing out of it way too fast. So, we never were able to use it for its intended use, but I guess it came in handy sometimes. Still, I don't think it's a necessary item unless you are tall with a small baby."
2,BrestFriend is better......,"I was told by friends how WONDERFUL the Boppy was, and also registered for it due to the number of rave reviews. However, I took it to the hospital with me and found that it is not as versatile as expected. It didn't fit around my waist, causing a huge crease in the middle. A friend suggested and actually sent me a ""My Brest Friend"", which I thought would sit in the closet but it actually turned out better. It has an adjustable velcro belt, so even Daddy (who is pretty big) can use it for bottle feedings. As suggested by others, you should really try them out before you spend the money."
2,Wait to buy,"I urge mothers to wait to purchase the boppy. I was sold by all the rave reviews, bought the pillow and never used it. I had an 8 lbs. 9 oz. baby boy and found it difficult to nurse him with it. It got in the way. Now it just sits in a corner. I guess I'll use it when he's learning to sit up to prop him up with. I urge mothers to borrow one first to see if they like it before spending the $."
3,Nice for breastfeeding,This is a good item if you are going to breastfeed. If you are going to bottle feed it is not worth it. I breastfeed for 3 1/2 months and it was fantastic for putting my son at the right angle to eat but after that time it was easier to just hold him with the regular bottle. I sometimes use it to prop him up to sit at 5 months but he pushes himself down onto his back to laydown.
5,This thing is great!,"Okay, so I'm not a nursing mother. In fact, I'm a dad, so I guess I can't speak from personal experience about the usefulness of this product for nursing. I do know that my wife loves it, though. And I even use it sometimes when I'm holding our son--I find that it is just high enough to set on my lap, and I can rest my arms against it and hold the baby without tiring my arms.The boppy has many uses, one of them being that you can put the baby in the hole in the middle and sit him up in a sort of reclining position. Our son finds this to his liking, and we often sit him up in it while he naps.Overall, this is an excellent product, highly recommended for moms (and dads)."
3,some doors opened and others still closed,"I was quite amused by the candor of information by Leadbeater, however there still where some areas that left unanwered questions. Leadbeater seemed to ramble during his discussion of ""alternate"" mysteries. Yet, overall the book is very informative for someone trying to see down a hallway."
2,Illustrations,"This is a reprint of a previous book. While the text is fairly good, it makes references to many illustrations which are not in the reprinted edition. Therefore, I would not recommend it!"
5,nostalgia,This book brings back lots of memories for anyone interested in major happenings of the mid-twentieth century. There is something of interest for everyone. It is worth a look and makes a good gift.
5,another delightful book by Atwell,"I love how Atwell sees the world from a long term perspective; it did not begin when we did but long, long before us. It will go on long after we are gone. It is up to us to be stewards for all time. Atwell conveys that message nicely in this book."
4,what a great story,"After hearing about this movie for months and months I bit the bullet and got it. I'm glad I did because Greenfingers is the sweetest movie I've seen in a long time. The premise is that a group of prisoners are sent to a open prison until their parole as long as they don't escape. After Clive Owen's character successfully grows violets the warden decides to make them gardeners. During all this the men begin to see a life outside of jail and end up at a flower show as well. If you want to see a movie that's different, pick Greenfingers out of the garden of videos out there. You'll be glad you did."
5,Prisoners enter the Hampton Court Flower show,"In a medium to minimum security prison in England, a new program is started to teach inmates how to garden in preparation for their parole. In the meantime, they make the prison grounds look nice. This is an unlikely group of gardeners, one short timer and three lifers, one of whom is dying of cancer. The four of them learn gardening from books written by a Ms. Woodhouse, who later hires them all in a sort of work release project renovating a garden in a local estate. There are many twists and turns and surprises, but the gardeners find their way to Hampton Court and happiness in the end. Helen Mirren, Clive Owen and the rest of the cast are perfect in their parts and the story is very good."
3,"Enjoyable, but tries a little too hard to be cute!","Greenfingers is a story of redemption by horticulture. Clive Owens does a good job of portraying a man imprisoned since he was 18 years old for murder, who ultimately is redeemed by discovering that he can foster life in the garden. At times Owens is too cold and distant--his portrayal would have been better if he had brought a little more variation in his emotional state.The supporting cast of British character actors do a nice job and are charming and sympathetic. Mirren plays the English matriarch with aplomb but overdoes it a little--just like the screen play which tries a little too hard to be cute at times. The major problem with the movie was a poor soundtrack--it was not well matched with the emotional content of the scenes.This was a movie that had a lot of potential that did not quite become fulfilled."
5,Such a good movie!,Why more people haven't heard of this movie I can't imagine! It is such a good movie and I never tire of watching it. Clive Owen and David Kelly were particularly good in it. Worth every penny and then some and please do not stop the movie when the credits begin to roll at the end otherwise you will miss a very funny remark that Clive Owen makes. I love this movie.
4,"Roses are red, Violets are blue","Clive Owen is just plain delightful in this movie. He doesn't play in too many comedies so be sure to catch this one. This is a very enjoyable British comedy/romance. The story centers around a convict that as a young man committed some unknown crime. When he is transferred to a prison with an eye on rehabilitation he discovers he can grow plants. After he does well with the prison garden, hortaculture becomes a sponsored work project. As they become a media draw they get political interest as well and find themselves in a quandry to do what they want and what the government and society wants. This is fun to watch and I especially recommend it to those that enjoy British comedies. Good quality DVD with great replayability. This is based on a true story and well worth owning."
3,nice looking film,"its a good film but some parts make it downfall and then it picks up the pace with beautiful acting. Clive Owen(Gosford Park, Croupier and Tv's Second Sight) has never been more awesomer in the title role as the man who is sent to a nice and non-violent prison place who ends up liking gardening and who is helped by friends. charming and nice. a keeper"
5,This was so funny,"I saw this movie at a preview screening in L.A. and I thought it was amazing.... it was such a cute, original story and all the actors were great. Clive Owen (who was in Croupier last year) was especially good - he is going to be a big star. This is a movie for everyone who loved Saving Grace and Waking Ned Devine."
4,An unexpected treat,"I came across this movie and stuck with it simply because I like the actors, but was pleasantly surprised to find the plot to be quite charming as well. It's apparently based on a true story, which makes it even better, because...SPOILER there is a happy ending."
5,Lovely,More people should see this delightful movie. The storyline is a bit unusual keeping you interestedThroughout and cheering for everyone in the show. A true delight to watch!
1,The Structure X is a bad shoe.,"I don't know what it is with the Structure 10s, but it causes me to get shin splints. I don't know what they changed about it, but it is no good. I went back to running in my 9's. And what do you know? The shin splints went away. I think I will try the 11s next and hope they changed the shoe back to how it was on the 9's."
1,Bad Nike Shoe,"The Nike TRIAX Air Structure 10 I purchased had a very poorly made left shoe, leaning far to the left. It makes me wonder if it is a 'knock-off' instead of Nike. I'll stick to my old source and style."
4,substitute for Asics 2xxx,"have been wearing Asics 2xxx models for about 8 years, and finally broke the trend with the AST10+, Nike and Apple got me with the Nike/iPod+ and I didnt really like velcroing the sensor to the tongue of my asics, but they had the support in the shoe. now NIKE finally makes a Nike+ WITH INNER FOOT SUPPORT AND CUSHIONING in the FOREFOOT. so far so good. Lets get moving...."
5,Unexpectedly delightful,"The Princess of Dhagabad is a joyful tale, not your average every day Genie in a Bottle, grant me 3 wishes formula. Besides the imaginative storyline, the book leaves you wanting to go back to the Ancients Sands again. Finally, it makes sense why this incredibly powerful being, a genie, would be in a bottle. The story develops both the genie and the girl who is his master, as she learns from him and learns about herself and he learns from her. A fantasy story that is NOT based on Tolkein."
2,Never received,Never received it! Don't know why it never downloaded - so don't know why I got this request for review.
2,Definitely a disappointment!,I had a hard time finishing this book. Not enough adventure for me. I was actually glad when I finally reached the end. I kept thinking the storyline might improve but to no avail. Definitely a disappointment.
2,Trite,"This could have been a wonderful book or romance and coming-of age. But it fails. Is it a romance? No, because it gives nothing to base the romance on other than curiosity. There is no romantic development. Is it a coming-of-age novel? No, because there is no character development for the princess. Also, why are Hasan's passages in the second person? Who is talking to him? Not worth the time to read."
5,A classic!,"If you are an adult who loves Harry Potter, you should definitely read this book. It is set in the ancient Middle East instead of modern day England, and it has those sensual parts that are definitely not appropriate for young adults, but this book has the same genuine purity of an all-time classic. It tells of a princess growing up in a richly described world of the Arabian nights. She is a shy and quiet child with a lot of responsibilities, but her life completely turns around on her twelfth birthday when she finds herself in command of an all-powerful djinn who obeys nobody else but her. It is not simply an adventure book, although you will find plenty of magical adventures an near-death experiences there. It explores the meaning of wisdom and suffering that comes with it. Also, the meaning of true love. The book is beautifully written and deeply moving and it will leave you wanting more."
1,Crap book. Total waste of money,"I am a very keen student of palmistry and doing it for 6 years. I have read many books on the subject which are close to 50. This book is a real waste of money. It is like a story book telling stories 90% of the time and giving 10% information which I dare say is true. The author as put up a name synonymous with the great palmist St German to get more people buy this waste of a book.The information in terms of palmistry is so minimum, I could tell all what was in the book in 5 pages.Devil must have struk me when I bought it. I am highly displeased. What a waste of my 10 dollars :("
3,Very boring book that makes almost no sense,"This book is a very boring book. Maybe I am just saying that because I had to read it for school, but this book doesn't make any sense. I see no point in this story whatsoever. There are some good points that are wonderfully written. other spots in the story are unbelievably hard to understand. This is not one of those books that you can't put down; moreover, it is one that you can't pick up. The plot is very hard to follow and in the end none of the main points seem to all tie up in some main ending. Maybe the point of the author was to leave you hanging, but I don't know. Oh well, don't waste your time with this one and try either OF MICE AND MEN or INTO THIN AIR."
1,This book is terrible.,"I was assigned to read this book for english class and found this book grossly overrated. I don't have the slightest clue how this work of garbage ended up on the top 100 books written this century. Considering the amount of time a person wastes reading this book, say three hours, and the amount of people who have and will read it, all the time squandered away adds up to hours , days, years, centurys and eons that have been wasted for nothing. It's spellbounding."
1,lord of the flies,Hated it. If your looking for a book that describes the scenery 90 percent of the time. This book is for u.
3,ExTrA CreDiT!!!!!!,"This is a good book for people who like twisted kind of books. In the book the young boys who are stranded on an island turn on each other. And not only do the turn on one another, they also end up killing one another. I enjoyed it because the book didn't stay in one mood, the boys went from civilized to savage. I didn't care for it because I couldn't relate to what was going on."
2,how can you like this?,"this book had good morals but it was so confusing, that to even understand one of the main points in the book i needed cliffs notes. some of it was exciting inside the chapter but i cant remember one cliffhanger chapter ending. trust me, if you are a teen, take it from another, unless FORCED to read this for school (like i was) dont read this book. it isnt worth your effort to read such a terrible book. whoever called it a classic is crazy"
4,Review of Beezebub,"The author's message is that with out rules, chaos and savagery would occur. I agree with this message because children left unattended have no one to prevent them from doing wrong, no authority. I like the characters and the plot that the author created. It really helps display the author's message of life without rules: everyone would run wild. The book was believable because the children really acted like children would act with out any adults. Although the novel had an excellent begining and middle, the ending was in one word, stupid. I didn't understand it either. The end seemed like he didn't spend much time on writing it and rushed. If he wouldn't have rushed, the ending would have been clearer."
3,"this is an okay book, but not one of the best i've read","i'm reading this book because it's required for junior english. i personally think that the beginning half of the book is boring and there is not point to it. i have heard that the ending is good, but if it were up to me i would not continue reading it. it just doesn't grab my attention like some books can. however, i have not finished the book and therefore cannot fairly judge it."
4,A superb book about man,Lord of the flies is a great book which shows the defects of human beings in an exciting and touching way.
4,Groosom,"I am from Tampa, Florida. I board at a school in Melborne called Florida Air Academy. My English teacher Mrs. Palmer made me read The Lord Of the Flies and animal farm. Animal Farm was really weird. This Book on the other hand is groosom. They have a little guy with marks on his face getting burned to death. There is also a little kid named Piggy that gets hit in the head with a rock and dies. All the little good kids on the Island die except for Ralph. Ralph was the leader of the kids then jack took over. This book is good for people that like reading about 6 - 12 year old kids killing each other. This book is a symbol of the modern world. When Golding wrote this book he might have been thinking about the future. With these two,seventeen year old kids killing those people in that school. They in a way became like these kids on the island"
2,Very Boring!,The book has a good theme about the break down of socializedbehavior but it gets really boring. The entire plot can be explannedin a pharagraph.
2,Lord of the Flies,"I was not a fan of this book because i couldn't get into the story line. I read it simply for school, not pleasure"
2,"Good story, poorly written...","I did not enjoy this book at all.In my opinion, this book tends to be a bit wordy and boring. The dialogue can be hard to follow at times, especially if you are unfamiliar with English slang of that time period. I had to force myself to read it, and the only reason I did so was because it's a classic. Although I get the point and I understand why the book has appeal, the writing didn't speak to me at all. Even if the story itself is good, and even though there is an underlying meaning that is worth conveying, to me, it's not worth dredging through the muck that is the writing in order to understand it.It's really quite unfortunate."
3,book was more than used,I thought I was getting a great deal on a used book for school. And found out why it was such a good deal. The book had TONS of writing in the pages. The seller did not state in the description that it may have a lot of notes and writing in the pages. I'm really disappointed. I'd pay extra to buy new in the future.
2,A week story with the outline shining through,"Ted Brautigan fromHearts In Atlantiscalled this book a rare good story written well (not a quote, but close enough). It must have been in the world from which Ted came. In this world the story is weak, predictable, laboriously plotted, written in rather lame language festering with pronouns and descriptions that paint no picture.The innocence of the age in which the book was written shows through and through: things that the author intended to be shocking pale in comparison with daily news stories of today."
3,Lord of the Flies By: Sean Hedges,The book Lord of the Flies in my opinion is a very interesting book to read. It is about a group of kids that get stranded on a deserted island. It shows how they survive and get along with each other. I would recomend this book to people that like to read old english and like drama and tension between people. It is a book more for people that can read and understand old english. Other wise it is a pretty good book to read.
3,"A biased opinion, but a good one....","Okay. Without being too cynical or anything, this book has just one major problem in my humble opinion: for those of us who could really give a hoot about botany, this guy writes far too much junk about what the trees and bushes and such look like. All throughout the book I found myself saying, ""Okay, they're on a deserted island with lots of trees, bushes! I get it already! Shut up about the damn trees!"" Seriously, it reads like this guy originally wrote a fifty page novel, and his editor or someone told him that it needed to be longer."
3,This was an action packed book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Lord of the Flies was an action book filled with adventure. I think that the author of this book had in mind what he was doing. The most action packed parts were when two of the main characters were killed. The rivalry that goes on in this story is somewhat serious when you have yong boys being cannibals. The things I didn't like was the length and some of the wording. The outcome really was a knowing situation. You knew that most likely they were going to be saved. The things I liked were when he had the characters express their feelings in a unusal and weird way. If you read this book you will be hot and cold. Hot being the action packed areas and cold being the not so action filled areas. I think that you should give this story a shot. I still warn you don't be disapointed by the length.Enjoy.
2,Take a break...read something else worthwhile,"It's true...the book in its entirety is extremely tedious and slow. The author spends a great deal of time describing the setting of the island, and other nuisances. In my opinion, the book did get better in the last couple of chapters, but still, I believe the theme of the book could've been developed earlier in the novel.The novel is a classic, the theme is excellent, yet I am disappointed with the progress of its plot."
2,NOT HIS BEST,I JUST FINISH READING THIS BOOK AND I HAVE READ BETTER BUT I GUESS IT IS OKAY SINCE IT CAME OUT IN THE 50'S BUT I EXPECT BETTER FROM GOLDING THE BEGINING OF THE BOOK WAS SLOW AND NOT TO THE POINT SOME OF THE CHARATER WERE GREAT AND OTHER NOT SO GREAT THE ENDING WAS THE BEST PART OF THE BOOK BUT TILL YOU GOT TO IT IT WAS NOT WORTH READING I HAVE READ SOME OF HIS OTHER BOOK AND THEY WERE GREAT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPEN TO THIS ONE CAUSE THIS WAS NOT HIS BEST WORK THE PART ABOUT sIMON DIEING I DID NOT GET AND I READ IT FIVEW TIME AND STILL GET IT AND NEVER WILL GET THERE WAS OTHER PART I DIDN'T GET BUT IT WOULD TAKE ALDAY TO TELL THBEM I HOPE YOU READ OTHER HE WROTE BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT HIS BEST
2,Gross,"It was easy enough to read, but it was really weird. The story started off decent, then seemed to get really stupid. Most of the good characters were killed and the ones that wre left were crazy"
3,M Opinion,"The lord of the flies is a book with a mixture violence, friendship, and magical realism. The friendship between Ralph and piggy isn't just any ordinary friendship but more like one between a teen and a pet he has owned since he was a small boy.The rivalry between Ralph and jack on the other hand is like that of two rampaging behemoths who despise each other.I like this book because of the small amount of magical realism that was added to this book because i dont't like realism. I don't like this book because of the descriptive senseless violence in it and also because I think that of kids that ages were stuck on an island the last thing they would think about would be hunting and killing. I think that other people might enjoy this book when they read it becuause of the violence and action."
4,A must read,"The noval ""Lord of the flies"" written by William Golding is one of the most complex books i have ever read. I love how this book makes you think and relate situations and characters to those in your own life. at first glance this noval may seem like its not worth reading but dont judge a book by its cover.the only reason i gave this book a 4 instead of 5 is that it diddnt seem very realistic for example: the boys age i didnt think they were old enogh to even really comprehend what they had done,also there seemed to be no remorse for death.But that is easily forgotton because of the intensity of this great book . Not only is this book entertaining and colorful but its also got a not so easily seen message.But through symbolism and getting to know the characters you will find that this book makes you see your society and yourself in a whole new way."
4,A book of a very different sort!,`Lord of the Flies' is a novel written on the forces of good and evil. It tells of the gradual destruction of the human nature. I can't tell whether the book is for children or for adults. The plot of the book is simple enough but the message Golding tried to give is very serious.A group of British schoolboys gets marooned on an uninhabited island while they were being transported to a safer place during Second World War. In the course of time the boys gets split amongst themselves and form two groups. Eventually their hostile attitude turns to war.The title `Lord of the Flies' is very vague. You won't get the meaning of it till you have read the book. In fact you get to know who or what the lord of the flies is after reading more than half of the book. This is a well-written book and if you are a person who is looking for food for thought `Lord of the Flies' is highly recommended.
2,Page Edges uneven,"This really looks to be very cheaply printed. I am not a big ""reader"", this book was mandatory for a class that I am enrolled in. The edges of the pages are not evenly cut. Its like I cut the pages out, one at a time, myself and bound the book. Some pages are wider and some narrower. Not impressed and would certainly consider purchasing a higher quality next time.Not the sellers fault, but the printing company."
4,My Lord of the Flies Review,"In my opinion,I thought this was a real interesting book. One of the things I enjoyed most about this book is that everything has a deeper meaning then you think. You have to try to thinik beyond what the words say and you have to have a big imagination. The only thing I didn't like about the Lord of the Flies is the deaths that occur in the story. I say this because I prefer to read happy and cheery books and the deaths in the story sort of brought me down.I think other people would also like this book. I say this because most readers like to read books that they can relate to, and in this story there are a wide variety of people that anyone can compare himself or ferself to."
3,Review for Lord of the Flies,I thought that the book Lord of the Flies a an okay book I would not say that it was the best book that I ever read. The reason that I liked this book was that Golding did a good job of making the book and allegory and he used the characters to show human nature how it can be good but mostly savage. I would think that people that like this book are the people that like to read story for the deep meaning and not have everything told to them and use their imagination when they are reading a story. So overall I thought that Lord of the Flies was an okay book.
1,hard time getting through this one,I know this is a classic but I really had a hard time getting through it. I read it in high school and thought to try it again thinking now that I'm older maybe i would enjoy it more. I didn't
1,ZZZZZZ,This book is so boring! The only reason I even finished it was because I had to (summer reading for english).
2,I give it a 2 for symbolism,"I really don't understand why many like this book and why it has become a classic. The plot is quite interesting. It's about 2 planes filled with British kids crashing on a deserted island. First of all, these kids would have died in a few weeks at the most! There is NO way normal men could kill wild boars, let alone young kids. Weapons are hard to make too, I don't know how the older young boys, around the age of 13, can make weapons that is sufficient and adequate enough to use for killing wild boars and other fierce creatures. This book is extremely far-fetched as I see it. But there are interesting elements too, I suppose. It's very symbolical. There's some symbols that I didn't fully interpret until I look into them closer, and I thought that was quite intriguing. It brings a more dark atmopshere into this book. One star for symbolism, and another one is to be respective for the effort of this book being made."
2,SCARY!,"I found this book offering a somewhat scary look at society. Golding seems to think that without society men are just in need of violence and sex, and the book totally forgets about women. I did not care for this book, and found it somewhat hard to follow."
1,Second worse book ever!,"I'm sorry, but I really hated this book! It was so simpleton and complicated at the same time. And Ralph is all terrible at the beggining and everyone just forgets abut it because he's their ""great leader"". I'm really sorry to everyone who likes this book, though."
1,"Amazing, but hopeless","I thought this was a horrible book.It is beautifully written, easy to read, and even real, to a certain extent. You only need to flip through a history book to see the horrible things people have done to other people. But to read about twelve year old boys killing each other is really sick. And that's what it is: a bunch of young boys are stuck on an island, they start off somewhat organized, and then, one by one, turn savage.My best friend recommended it to me, saying the ending was amazing. Perhaps it is. It is a sudden let down from the tension. Yes, I agree, it is amazingly written, but it is also hopeless. What life is left for the boys? They'll need a lot of visits to the shrink, I expect.But that's not what it's about. We are not supposed to think of the long term, only be aware of the depravity of the human race. Anyway, that's what I got out of it. And I am glad I read it - if only to say that I read it and now sort of know what the fuss is all about."
1,Wow.,"Wow. Wow. I cannot believe that this has never received less than three stars. Are you guys serious?? A bunch of boys on an island who turn into savages, and then, at the last minute, when the protagonist is about to die, they get rescued?? This is, of course, after waiting the whole book for this to happen. Oh, by the way, kill all the good characters, and make a set of twins into a single person. What a fantastic idea!!I don't quite know what else to say except: really? really?Really? No girls. Really? A talking pig head?? REALLY??To put it simply: this buck sucked."
3,"You should read this book, if only as a point of reference","Admittedly, it has been nearly a decade since I read ""Lord,"" and at the time I enjoyed it, even though I was too young to understand what was being said. The fact is that, at the time, I thought the book lagged at times, which is deadly to a casual young reader, as I was. When I think about what I remember of the book now, its kind of mysogynistic. I recommend it, marginally, though I plan to buy a new copy (my old one went the way of Piggy) and give it another go as an adult. I would suggest ""Animal Farm"" over this, if the symbolic or allegorical content is what you are looking for. Or, if you like this kind of stuff and dont mind reading some non-fiction, you might considder looking up the Stanford prison experiment (the event, not the band)."
4,Lord of the Flies,"Lord of the Flies is one of the best books for young adults as there is. The book contians many controversial issues as well as great Fruedian interpretations that can be used by Lit as well as Psych instructors alike. We have all four elements for Frued, Id, Ego, Super Ego, and a Christ Figure. It deasl with laziness fitting in, growth and development of characters, and many other issues. The story of a plane wrecked bunch of kids on an isolateed island, sounds more like a sociology experiment than a book but thats what we get here. Not to give away the book but there is killing and hunting and blood and guts all around. Action packed and Symbolism a plenty..."
4,"Good classic, but confusing","For a long time I couldn't fit names to characters... about halfway through the book, I finally got it straight. That might be just me, but I don't think so. Other than that, however, the book is wonderful. It's actually an easy read; I sat down and read the whole thing in two days. I love the symbolism given by the 'lord of the flies', and the rivalry that the boys end up in is very realistic. All in all, a very reccommended book."
3,An interesting portrayal of anarchy...,"I read this book in 6th grade, as part of an ""advanced"" program. I wish I hadn't read it quite that early; I might have enjoyed it more. I found it hard to get past the graphic descriptions of blood and gore and to the meat of the story. I do suggest it, however; it seemed like an interesting book. (Being a 6th grade girl, I wasn't so into the ""blood and gore, more and more"" thing.)It does contain some disturbing subject matter, so it's probably not for kids. (Mature 8th graders and above would be my recommendation.) All in all, though, Golding describes what happens when society falls apart very vividly, and portrays the savageness of humanity gone wrong very well."
4,THUMBS UP OH YEAH,"The Lord of the Flies tells the story of a group of boys (pre-teens and younger) who become stranded on an island with no adult supervision. Ralph is appointed their leader, but another boy, Jack, feels he is better suited to the position and ends up rebelling. The boys are plagued by ""beasties"" and ""serpents,"" but in the end, as they are driven to murder and betrayal, they realize that the only beasts on the island were in themselves.Whether or not you look at this novel as a fable, a myth (as Golding preferred to call it), or a simple ""what if?"" story, I think it is very good. The novel itself is fairly simple, but it leaves much to be discussed and/or mulled over. Many people think that the ending is ""cheap"" or ""gimmicky,"" but I think that it was the only ending that could have worked so effectively.Anyway, I recommend this to anyone, whether or not you need a book for class or for leisure."
4,Check It Out,"What would you do trapped on an island with no adult supervision and no way out? When a plane full of boys from a boarding school goes down on an island, the boys are forced to survive. A boy name Ralph emerges as the leader and tries to guide the other boys to being rescued. Problems occur when Ralph clashes with Jack's stubborn personality. Jack leads his own little group called the choir, which tends the fire and goes on hunts. Piggy is a caring boy who looks out for the young children but is always picked on. Read how Ralph, Jack, Piggy and all the other boys survive on the island hoping to be rescued. William Golding's creativity, characterization, and plot are marvelous. Will all the boys survive? Will they ever get rescued? Who will emerge as the leader?"
4,Lord of the flies,This book is really good especially since at my age you can relate to some of the characters. Everyone knows a Ralph or Jack in their life. What I liked about his book is how Golding can make the island a symbol of how the world is. Also he makes symbols of all these important things so once you actually read it carefully you get the real meaning of the book which is how mankind is actually is. What I didnt like about the book was that it only had boys. It seems like if males can only survive or if they're more better than females. I would recommend this book to anyone in high school or older but mainly to high school age students since this is a book that makes you relate to all the characters in the book.
1,Unusable book not as described,"This was described to be a ""good"" or ""like new"" condition (I don't remember which now) paperback of a classic book in a more recent edition. Instead it is actually an extremely ancient, yellowed & smelly paged, hard-covered, paperback-style school-copy dated 1954, that has no less that 8 student names written in it. Very Nasty! It is an older edition, stinks, and could not fairly be described as anything better than ""usable if very desperate!"" We threw it away and will be buying a new one from someone else. Allergies keep us from reading yellowed, smelly, 56 year old, heavily used, cheap books!!"
2,Lord of the Flies,"Book was ok, nothing special. The only issue I had was with the vendor. Book was late to arrive and with postage due."
1,Poor Condition,I mean I know I bought it used but it came with writing in the margins and half the book was highlighted. Someone's name and teacher written inside the cover. I bought it as a Christmas gift but that sure isn't happening.Will certainly keep in mind who I bought this from. I am pretty sure I would only buy something listed in good to excellent condition but oh well such is life. Not going to make a big deal out of it because its not worth my time but for future reference just send what people are expecting.
1,An insight into the minds of young men with no rules,"This book conveyed a great message, but the naive characters were often not satisfactory heroes."
1,desappointing,"although paid extra for expedite delivery, this school required book was delivered a month later!"
1,YUCK,"All I have to say about this book is that it is disscusting, it is most not for little children"
1,Not what was advertised,This book wasn't the edition that it said it was. On top of that it was full of markings with highlighter and pen. The pages were in good shape except for the writing everywhere. I'm very disappointed
1,Most Disappointed,"Well, how can I review this product when it still haven't arrived. It has apparently been resent but once again hasn't arrived. Very disappointed!!!!"
1,Late product,"This is a bad product, my package is late i ordered it almost a month ago and still haven't received it"
2,WHAT'S ALL THE FUSS ABOUT???,"In my readings of ""The Lord of the Flies"", I felt the element of the story was slow as a senior citizen. It's like watching flies breed. This book reminded me of an old ""Surivivor"" episode but without the male nudity. I could see how someone that is a visual learner would like this book. It, however, leaves little to the imagination. Nevertheless, I give it props for being a well-written book. Peace out!Chino High rocks, period!!"
1,Book was assembled poorly. Still a great story,"Unfortunately the copy that I recieved repeats Chapter 5, and is missing Chapters 6 and 7. We know it is a great story. Bought the book for my kid who needed it for for a school assignment. Quality control is unacceptable."
1,A very boring book.,I might just be a teen in high school but I know what I like and this book was not one in my interest. Although William Gerald Golding wrote this worthwhile astonishing book it made no imapct to my opinion. The book was very well presented and had touching moments but lacked the realism that books have to maintain. Its moments of exitement were short lived and really weren't that exciting to begin with. All in all it was a hell of a book to those who actually like reading books. To tell the truth I hardly remember what the book was about.
1,Thumbs down,"God this was terrible.A group of children are marooned on a deserted island and must survive on their own. We see the rise and fall of their society as order is achieved; power corrupts the strongest of the group and the weakest members are dismissed or destroyed and finally chaos rules.Despite my dislike of this book, I'll admit it is a very true commentary on society. The powerful abuse those weaker than them; how quickly rules become obsolete when they become inconvenient; the set roles of people in society (the chubby guy with glasses can never be as powerful as the cool, good-looking guy).If you are not being forced to read this for school, please don't do it! The Simpsons parody of it is also a good thing to watch. At least in a cartoon it is entertaining, with just as much commentary on society as the original."
1,An unimpressive let down,"I read Lord of the Flies and I can honestly say that it is thought of too highly.The symbolism is way to obvious, and pathetic fallacy is not used to it's full potential. There is no other book quite like it. Thank God."
1,SITHSPAWN-i hate this book,Not sence reading the crystal Star and the Black Fleet Crisis Trilogy have i detested a book! If you want the point of the book watch the Simpsons parody. It's funnier and it makes fun of Bill Gates.
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great Either; Its OK","The author's purpose for writing this book is to send a message to the readers. I agree with his message because it informs you of how cruel people can be. I think the literary element the author handled best was the characters. They were very well described by their looks as well as their actions. This book was believable because the way the story was written, because it has real personalities as real people. For example, when people are in a group they change to fit in, just like the characters in the story they all became savages. This book was ""less than perfect"" because it didn't have any girls and the ending was not very elaborate either. I would fix the flaws by adding more things, like girls to see how they would react and be more elaborate in the ending. If I were to rate this book it would be fair."
3,cool book,I think the author was trying to say that without rules there would be total chaos.Thats just like if there was no rules in school there would be total chaos. The characters were very symbolic.Each character had a meaning for there themselves and something deeper. I think the book was very realistic therefore it was a good book. I would probably change the part when simon was talking to the pigs head though.It could sound a little more realistic.
3,Different from other books,In the book Lord of the Flies Golding is trying to show how evil comes out of people when they fear the unknown. I agree with the message he is trying to send out to the readers because people are scared of what they don;t know and sometimes handle it in a crazy behavior. I think he handled the characters very well because you can see how different they are from each other and how much evil they they have in themselves. I think this book was pretty good and i would encourage you to read this book if you like adventure and want to learn new things.
3,Maybe,"I liked the book because of the action and how I saw the different characteristics of each character. The type of person that I think that would like the book the most is the adventurous type.I think the purpose for writing the book was to show that without authority, there would be total chaos. I agree with the message because when the kids got used to not having a parental figure around they did what they wanted. The element that was handled best was the climax because of how detailed he explained every thing that was going on. This book was very believable because you're always hearing about people getting into plane crashes and they were standed on an island for a long period of time and they had to use a lot of survival skills.The book was less than perfect because in the middle of action Golding jumps to something totally different. I would fix these flaws by continuing until the action is over. All in all this book was an ok book to read."
3,Trust me read this Book!!!!!,"This book was really great and I would suggest to my friends to read this book. At first I didn't like it but when everything started happening I really started to enjoy the book. My teacher also made the book very fun to read becasue she put alot of energy into it. The more energy you use to read the book the better it is. The only thing I disagreed with in the book was that Ralph was the leader. I thought with the help of Ralph,Piggy would have been the best leader because he was the smartest one in the group. I also think Golding did a good job writing this book. He used alot of themes that are in society today,and made me think what if something like that could happen, what would it be like. Trust me if you read this book you will be very impressed. One Love and Peace Out!!"
3,Lord of the Flies,"Golding is writing this book so he can send out a message. The message is there is evil inside everyone. I do not agree with this message because Simon was pure good. The literary element I think he used best is symbolism because he used it alot. I think this book is very believable because there is evil in some boys, and those boys will do crazy things. There is only one thing I don't like about this book. I think Jack or Roger should of die or really get hurt."
2,"It's a good book, but not my favorite","Golding was trying to say that there is evil in everyone. I do agree on this theme becuase I don't think everyone is ""good"". I believe everyone does something that is evil. Although, some people have it in them more than others. I think the author used a lot of description which made it really boring. He also used too much violence, which in my opinion, only made it worse. I think this can happen to anyone who is in a plane crash. Being in this situatuion can get your mind crazy and make you do weird things, like the boys did. If it was me who wrote the book, I would use less description becuase is made it boring. I would also make it less vioent."
4,"Way Better Than ""Lord of the Dance""","If you have ever read ""Animal Farm"" by George Orwell,then you will enjoy ""Lord of the Flies"". ""Lord of the Flies"" is a book that demonstrates how society deals with war, and also serves as a warning bell to society to show people what could happen if they don't react more civilized in a time of crisis. Golding symbolized this situation with children stranded on an island forced to live by themselves and under their own rules. This is a great book if like political/war novels or if like Goerge Orwell since both authors deal with the same topics."
3,Lord of the Flies,"I personally disliked the book except for a few parts. I also do not see any significance from the title to the book. There is only one scene mentioning the ""Lord of the Flies"", and I dont get it. All it is is a pig head on a stick with flies all over it and a delerious kid thinks its talking to him. It did not make any sense to me what so ever. I might appreciate the book more if I understood the meaning for the title and how it relates to the book."
2,"It was boring, but informative.","I felt that the book ""Lord of the Flies"" was very hard to get into. It has a lot of description, so that you feel right there with the characters on the island, which is what made me continue reading!!! It had a very unsatisfying finish; it ended too quickly and without any resolution!"
3,Where are the women?,"It was an entertaining, fast read. If the book is essentially about man's primitive wants and desires, then where are the women? I don't buy the fact that the pig represents a woman. Maybe someone can help me out on this one!"
3,Lord of the Flies Book Reveiw,I thought that this book was qite good it was very discriptive and had lots of similies and metophores in it. However it was a bit complicated and if i hadn't have seen the film first then i wouldn't know what half of it was going on about.
5,A Classic,"Sometimes you just happen upon a book that just draws you in and becomes an important part of your bookshelf. This happened with Lord of the Flies. I'm normally one who steers away from literature in the 'classics' section at Borders, as it gives me memories of bad books that we've all been forced to read in high school (then again, maybe I'm just to young too appreciate The Awakening or Mainstreet... ) I just happened to randomly pick this book off the shelf and start reading while I was waiting for a friend to find something. By the time she came back, I was so engaged in the first chapter that I bought it. I enjoyed it...it's the type of book that you can ponder about afterwards and it's not a boring read (*cough*Lord of the Rings*cough*). In fact, I ALMOST enjoyed writing a paper about it senior year! If you'd like to read something unique, disturbing, and thought provoking, then this something you should read."
2,The Bad before the Good,"This book was absolutely awful until I reached the notes at the end of the book. I was bored by the lack of theme to the story and much of the visual descritpion was unnessecary. I was also confused by the absence of important information. Not until the end of the book did I realize that the story took place during World War II. Also, I could not decipher who the boys were and why they were all together yet did not know each other for some time. Once I reached the reflective notes at the end, though, I was very impressed by the symbolism and hidden ideas in the book. I would only prefer to find them myself in the reading, rather than be told them at the end. For instance, I made no connection as to how the sow was killed to rape because the killing was not vividly described, and no resemblance was obvious. The notes told me that, and I understood the total point the author was trying to make more, but I was still disappointed that I could not have made the connections myself."
5,"Huh? Oh, I get it!","This book has too much symbolism if you can't think deep enough. The book is mainly about human tendencies. It could be read on a political level, but that takes too much brain power. There is some killing and graphic violence. Above all, the book is one of the best books period."
3,It was a pretty good book.,"My favorite character was Piggy, a big kid who was really nice and a big heart and Ralph who was the leader but was having problems with some of the kids on the island. I didn't like Jack who was the leader of the chorus. He was cold, haunted and rude. He was the one who killed two of the other characters in the story. Then there was Simon. He was a hard worker but was too young to be leader, even though he would have made a better leader than any of the others. This story did not seem realistic to me because it's not likely that kids would actually survive on an island. I would recommend this story to kids who like action packed novels."
3,A great book for a kid about survival and leadership,"If you want a book with diversity this is the one to choose. A plane crash leaves about 100 boys and no adult stranded on an island. A 12-year-old by the name of ralph is elected leader and together they must combat starvation, dehydration and disease."
3,"Good Story, But Feasible?","Golding has written an interesting story about behavior changes in boys stranded on an island. But I found that much of the behaviors hard to believe from the relatively short amount of time spent there. His views, however, are well taken. This is a good read."
2,"Thought out, but not well written book...","I don't think that this book is as good as it is made out to be. I think that the idea, or theme of the book was well thought out, but I don't really think that is was well written. Golding had a good theme to his book, about how we still have wild instincts that are just covered up by civilization until we feel the struggle to survive or the threat to our own life. Golding book was, in my thought, not well written. It was overly descriptive at some points, to the point where it lost your interest. After finishing the book, it was easier to understand, thinking through the whole story without being held back by Golding's descriptive periods. I did not enjoy this book, though projects used to review the book in the classroom were fun and interesting."
2,Gruesome Savages,The Lord of the Flies is about boys who are in a plane crash and get stuck on an island. Its a story about Ralph tring to keep the boys together as one tribe but Jack pulling away. Jack and the hunters become savages. Their main focus is hunting. Ralph has trouble with this because he needs help with other things. Their disagreements lead to a lot of fighting and deaths. I didf not enjoy the book I found it very gruesome and there was to much savageness. Although the storyline was enjoyable there are very many areas that just made me put the book down and never want to pick it back up.
2,"Great book, but the author's reading is terrible","I love this book, but I wasn't halfway through the introduction when I realized how painful it would be to have the author read it to me. He sighs and breathes heavy in the middle of sentences, speaks in a monotone voice, and makes all the characters sound the same, which makes it hard to tell who is saying what during the book's argument scenes.Overall, great story that deserved a professional voice actor to read it - somebody who could have made the story come alive. Any nuance the author could have added through his own insight into the story was lost in the lackluster presentation."
3,A fascinating nightmare,"This novel tries to show the origin or all the bad in the world. The answer give a group of British schoolboys on a lonely island: they create a society determined of cruelty. The moral of the thought provoking book is that all the bad is caused by the bad in the human himself. the theory of baal-zebub. It's a story full of surprises and easy to read. I can't recommend it to everybody, it's interesting but not great."
3,Morbid and Depressing,"I thought that this book focused primarily on the flaws of society through the actions of the stranded young men. I thought that was a unique an interesting way to show people how awfully crude our society can be, but the rest of the book was horrid. The killings of some of the boys, and the fact that you are just reading about boys, did not appeal to me. If you like books in the adventure genre, this a book for you. Otherwise, steer clear."
3,Great Book,"My Thoughts on ""Lord Of The Flies"" Is that it brings so much insight and can help us understand ourselves better. The story is so great; it shows how nature and man can combine together and accomplish good or evil. Golding brings these kids on this island where they will have to face many challenges and fight with life and death.He brings mankind and civilization together and makes the island like a war against nature. My opinion is when he creates the plots and description of the story he describes the characters and the island and the plots so well. I like how he makes the story like giving us a sigh of the world we live in today on how the world can be so cruel and evil but the outcome of it can be very good. Overall, this was a very great book."
1,Very Depressing,"I'm going into tenth grade at Poudre High School and this was one of the summer reading books we are required to read for the program I'm in called IB. This book was good in the sense that it focused on the faults of society through the group of stranded boys on the island, which was very creative. But I however did not like the book for the sole reason of the killings, and how the boys felt no remorse at all, except for Ralph. This is exaclty what the author intended of course, but I thought it was very morbid and cruel. I would advise you not to read this book if you are looking for something uplifting."
1,Very Confusing and Not Very Fun,"I had to read this for a grade in Literature class, as did two of my other friends. Well, we all read the book and we all failed the test. Keep in mind, we are honor students. I would never recommend this book to anyone, especially not if it is crucial to your grade. It is a confusing, negative look at human nature, riddled with dreadful imagery and general savagery. Not exactly top on my list of favorite books, I don't think I could ever bear to read this again."
1,This book is bad,"When I finished this book I was very depressed and somewhat angry. Most of the characters in this book remind me of the shooters at Littleton, CO. This book would probably disturb someone who had experienced violence at the hands of thier peers. Why are books like this on middle/high school reading lists? I thought we were trying to promote good values in school, not total disregard for life!"
1,If only I could give it zero stars!,"This is the worst book I have ever read. It was extremely dull and violent at the same time. I usually read a book this length in three days, but it took me TWO MONTHS to read this book. I only read it because I had to for school, and I would not read this book again for anything. It was pointless and confusing. I don't care if it was figurative language or not, it was a really below average piece of work. Ugh."
1,The Lord of the Flies,"I feel that this book reflects the society that we live in. In our world and the situation of the book. In their world and ours alike, we don't make piece, we have war and fights."
2,Anyone For Pig On A Stick?,"I didn't like this book because of the gruesome behavior of Jack and the other boys on the island. They had been out of civilization for so long that killing a pig, or even each other, sounded like so much fun they couldn't resist it. I would give this book two thumbs down. Don't read it if you don't have to"
1,BORING!!!,"This book is probably one of the most boring books I have EVER read! The book is about a group of boys stranded on an island. The author tries to show how society works, and what would happen if a group of young boys were stranded on an island, but fails miserably. His opinion of what would happen is just wrong. And even if you do agree (once you've read the book) the writing still destroys the book. It is such a slow book! Way too much unnecassary details! When it comes to an actual important part of the book, there is barely any time spent on it. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! (unless you want to see for yourself how bad it is!)"
1,Cynicism at its best...,"It's interesting to see how cynical a successfull author can be, and how popular such cynicism can be. Lord of the Flies might be a suspenseful and thought-provoking book, but it's main thesis --children turning into beasts as soon as the burden of civilization is taken off them-- is utterly silly. It makes me wonder how many children Mr. William Golding really knew or talked to before writing this book. Children are always capable (many times much more than grownups) to act with common-sense and responsibility. I think Mr. Golding knew this (he can't be that narrow-minded), but simply choose to forget it since it would destroy his thesis and he wouldn't be able to write this novel. It's also fun to see how easily some authors can ignore or blur the most simple realities. I don't recommend this book to anyone who loves children and childhood, which is a period of exploration and friendships."
5,The Head of an Animal . . .,"Well, most people in America have already read ""Lord of the Flies"" by William Golding, which is definitely a classic. So I'm not going to give a synopsis, just a general appraisal of the work.The main characters (Ralph, Jack, Piggy, Roger, and many more) are very complex and very riveting. You can clearly observe their distinctive personalities with their actions and their dialogue. And you feel sorry for these characters when something goes horribly wrong.There are many symbolisms in this book (the conch, the pigs, the flies, etc.), and they work very well here. Interpretations are open (except when it comes to the obvious ones). Tensions are high as we slowly move towards the climax. No Hollywood ending here.Golding has created an influential work of art, as highlights in this book are many. This isn't an innocent story, and it's no cliché, either. Kudos to the author.A+"
1,lord of the flies bokk review,"""The lord of the flies"" By william Golding, is in my opinion one of the most boring book i have ever read in my whole life. but on the other hand it did have alot to say about our ""humanly nature"" most of it was true.This book was like a little summary of our violent nature throughout history. But overall it was terably boring!!!!!"
1,the worst novel I have ever read,the only reason for anyone to ever read this is for school word as it has no content to the book as well as the book is just about a bunch of kids turning into sick bastards which again makes me.... sick?
4,Keeps you interested from cover to cover,"William Golding's Lord of the Flies keeps your interest from the beginning to the end, from the crash to the rescue. Throughout the book, problems for the boys revolve around the concepts of man vs. man and man vs. nature more often than not. Most of the boys which have come from big cities are not used to killing their own food let alone fighting for their lives on a secluded island without any contact with the ""outside world."" After reading this novel Ralph, Piggy, Jack and the rest of the boys are not only characters in a book, but figures which become part of you life. Although the book deals with the lives of younger people, it is definitely a book for all ages."
3,This book is about boys trapped on an island,"This book is about a group of young British boys stranded on an island. No more, no less."
4,A classic,This book appeals to a wide range of ages. Teens will appreciate the story on the superficial level while adults will be drawn by the deeper social commentary. The symbolism here is artfully constructed and each reader will interpret the book a little differently. There's a reason this book is considered a classic
4,Good novel,this is a good book that shows a struggle of man against evil. yet there is a deeper meaning to it all. very intriguing and overall a good book. easy to read and a significant amount of symbolism add to the depth of this book. a great book to read.
3,OK book,"I had to read this book last year in 8th grade. It probably would have been an OK book but it has too much SYMBOLISM!! OMG in every chapter there are like 10 different symbols that you have to think about. If you really like books that you have to think about alot then I would reccomend this book, but if you just like to read a book and get it over with, then this is not the book for you!"
2,Boring,"I would not reccomend this book. It was very boring and I didn't find much of a purpose. The end was the best part, but it was still bad. l did not get into this book or enjoy it. it was for school."
2,Not crazy about it,I did not really enjoy this book. I could not connect with the characters. I thought that the book was very annoying and some of the part bothered me. It seemed very unrealistic.
3,received wrong book,"I ordered lord of the flies and received a clive barker book instead. The company said it was a mistake, and apologized, but they were also out of stock of lord of the flies. They said to keep the clive barker book, and also gave me a full refund. I'm happy with their customer service, but in the end I didn't get the book I wanted and had to order it from another vendor."
4,It is quite interesting,"We are reading it in school, and I am enjoying it. I think it is interesting to see how the young boys changed from small angles to wild monsters"
4,Lord of the Flies,In this novel I think that the author purpose for writing this book was to state that all people are born naturally evil.I don't agree with the author though.I think that the people are changed into evil and not born into it. The literary element I think the author handled best was characters.I think this because he made each character have their own atutitudes and way they acted.Golding did a good job with giving the characters details. Yes I think this looks was believable.I so becaue everything that happened to them can happen to someone we know or someone we love. I don't think that there was ways the book was less than perfect.If I was a writer I would just make it more suspenseful to make people want to read the book.Thats how I would fix the flaw. stix
3,"Good as a literature piece, but too hard, too cruel","You will not feel good reading this book. You would find many symbols (the way the society works, the interactions between humans, and so on) through the story and their meanings, and may be interested in them, but no joy from the story itself. Too cruel, it will shock you, for sure...."
4,Great imagery and insight,"Wow. This book awed me with it's power. It makes you think... is our essense really so savage and bloodthirsty? The speed of their decline into savagery shocked me... surely they had been trained well by then. How could they discard their taught social characteristics so easily? What also left an impression on me was Ralph... at the first of the book he was pliant to the whims of the mob, pleasure-seeking and immature. By the end he is a leader who laments the loss of innocence and reason. I guess, though I don't usually like books with so much description of the foliage, the reason it is such a worthy book is that I will remember it... I will remember Ralph being manhunted, his fear almost palpable."
3,meaningful point,"I am only ten so it took a while to read this book. Every night I went to bed wondering what would happen next. In real life I don't think boys would do such evil things. It also has too many stupid British words, you would be better off reading something by an American author. At least they would be able to have a little more common sense and write about something a tad more believable."
2,"OKAY idea, but this man was more of a pessimist than >I< am","I was forced to read this book last year, my Freshman year. I was entertained by the PREMISE of the book at first.. but then lost all interest. Let's see here.. a Lord of the Flies Timeline: Day One--Plane crashes, kids gather, etc. They find and are unable to kill the pig. Day THree (aprox) The kids are now half naked, spear-toting, near-savages who cannot agree one anything (JUMP) Day Eighteen--Bloodthirsty, Chanting monsters who kill for pleasure I really think that Golding is a horrible man. We, as humans, DO have a dark side. But for God's sake, it would take MONTHS for the kids to fall THAT far! Years, maybe! (Of course, somethimes people survive just fine...take ""Gilligan's Island"" as an example. Then again, weren't we all hoping for SOMETHING to happen?) Well.. Stay away. Unless you really DO think that people could degenrate so fast."
