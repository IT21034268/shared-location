1,Haven't seen a prequel this bad since Star Wars Episode One,"This game was short. This game had no interesting story, This game was just a shooter. You walk around a corner, you shoot the bad guys. You go across a room you shoot the bad guys, you climb a ladder and you shoot the bad guys...See a pattern. The sad a part is there is not that much variety in what bad guys you can shoot, Ocassionally you had to get stuff and push a button, but mostly you shoot the bad guy. Sure the graphics were spiffy, but gameply bites. The only shining star in this game was some of the dialouge between the bad guys before you show up and.....yes shoot the bad guy."
4,Not just another contract killer,"For those of use who loved the first two installments of the series (NOLF 1 & 2) this game is not just more of the same. The focus shifted from stealth to action and the only way to get out of any situation is pure violence. Enemies are harder to kill than in NOFL, even if they look similar. They duck and weave in a very realistic manner and they even act together. And you never get just one: Packs of 5 or 6 are the norm. Humor is still there, but sometimes you cannot really pay attention to it over the sound of fire.The only drawback: It's too short! Only 7 chapters and only one level boss in the single player. I have not played the multiplayer though. In conclusion, a great game, testosterone heavy and full of action. Where else than in the NOLF universe can you be the bad guy and enjoy it so much? I imagine that a showdown with Kate is part of Sierra's plans for the future. I look forward to it"
2,confused narration,"i so wanted to like this book. i've seen one of the subtittled anime videos of vampire princees miyu, and although i found the story arc muddled, i was intrigued by the character.the first book 'origins' did nothing to clarify matters, i just ended up with more questions. normally this would intensify my longing to discover more, but at 12 bucks a pop, for less than an hours worth of reading- it just isn't worth it.the author apologizes at the beginning about the art not being up to the standards it should be- and she's right, but the problem lies more in the way the story is told- the conversations and actions are cryptic for the most part, and the rest of the story is lacking in clues to make up for the ambiguity clouded around so many of the plot points.i'd only recommend reading this if you can easily afford the entire series."
4,MARIO MORENO IS A MASTER IN HUMOR,"This is my favorite movie of Cantinflas. i was little whern i saw this movie, and i can't help to watch it over and over again it was so funny and with a great and sad story. When i heard that the movie was coming in dvd i bought it inmediatly it's so funny and cute. Cantinflas will always live in our hearts. here in my country (Peru) all sundays in tv they play one of his movies and i always laugh so much"
1,"Don't Believe ""IN STOCK""","I ordered this product two days ago and called to check the status. They said the item was not in stock and was back ordered. This is a CHRISTMAS PRSENT!! I wouldn't have gotten it unitl NEXT YEAR!! This company is a joke. Maybe the product is fine but the customer service is a crock, the reprsentative even hung up on me!! If my credit card gets charged by this company, I'll have a come-a-part on them."
3,The prayers of Jesus,"The book is helpful to the age of adults I am teaching. However, using it WITH the video is less than satisfactory. The people are upset that the speakers do not talk to them, but to someone(s) over their shoulder.The book allows for them to follow the talk fairly well. I have added a great deal more from commentaries. This opens conversations better than either the book OR the video.The content and the background pictures AND the expertise of the speakers are wonderful. The production of the product leaves a great deal to be desired."
2,A little disappointing,"I was expecting more action, but felt a little shortchanged. Herbert is one of those authors who likes to keep the scary things not fully seen, which is great for enhancing the reader response to the scare, but a bit out of place in this book where the point is wanting to see what's in the fog. I felt frustrated while I was reading. The reader desperately wants glimpses into the fog, but Herbert really doesn't deliver.Not a bad book. This is a decently enjoyable horror read, but probably not as frightening as it could be. I give it 3 stars in terms of scariness."
3,I think this gets way too many kudos,"I've read 3 Herbert books, and he tends to be pretty hit or miss. This one involves an ""evil fog"" that makes people crazy. The British government runs around trying to stop it. That's essentially the whole book. It might have been a much more original idea back when the book was written, but the concept has been done repeatedly since, and far better. I wonted hold the dated premise against it though. I could let the concept fly if the characters and their actions were in any way remarkable. They are not. Maybe the suffering of the infected was exquisitely detailed? Nope. So what we are left with is a very familiar storyline, both in concept and in the way it unfolds, and no distinct personalization to make any of it more palatable. I don't feel like it was a total waste of time, but I didn't keep my copy."
3,Nothing odd about fog in England...,"Or is there? When a routine excursion for a contracted civil servant leads to his barely escaping the jaws of death in Southern England, one event after the other points to a Defense Ministry experiment gone horribly wrong.A rather original thriller set in the fields of Salisbury, Fog keeps pace with the sordid consequences, zombified victims and scrambling authorities who try to contain the genie.Fog is of special interest personally because, having visited Salisbury, the setting is indeed home to a British military base. The novel incorporates a romantic sub-plot and begins to fall apart towards the end. Still, horror fans will derive a couple of days' of gory amusement from the... Fog."
3,Very good but a little bit far-fetched,"I found this book very interesting and it was very gory. The characters were described well.I think that is a good book, but a yellow fog that comes out of an eathquake, makes people go insane and makes them commit mass suicide is a bit far-fetched"
4,"Beware The Fog, it will drive you mad!","""I was sitting in a meeting when I wondered what would happen if the main speaker just got up and jumped out the window?"" - James Herbert on the key visual idea that led to his writing The Fog.When an earthquake shatters an otherwise peaceful day, no one notices the yellow mist that drifts from the yawning chasm that has opened up beneath the main street. But the violent, babbling madman that is dragged from the trench afterwards gives everyone a hint as to the horrors that are to come. It seems that a bacterial weapon has gotten loose and, as it interacts with the air, the mist thickens into a roaming, yellowish fog that drives any and all exposed to it mad. As entire communities fall victim to its horrible effects, the authorities wonder how it can be stopped. James Herbert's second novel is just as much a zesty sex laced blood bath as his first and it makes a great double bill with Richard Layman's One Rainy Night."
3,Nasty!,"This is my favourite James Herbert novel and the first i read. Like all James Herbert novels it contains sterotypes instead of characters, amusingly gory sequences often underlaced with black humour and the obligatory sex by numbers scene. Despite all that this book is great fun and used to be quite controversial. More for teens that adult horror fans (honest! i read it when i was fourteen)."
3,Review of Classic American Airliners,"This would have been a 5 star review except for leaving out the Martin 202/404,Lockheed Lodestar, and DC-3. These omissions leave a big gap unless the intent was post WW2 only. If that was the intent, the Martin 404 omission still is glaring. Too bad. What's is covered is well done and well reproduced."
3,Great Nostalgia!,The book has excellent histories and photos.A major fault: Mere mention and no photos of the greatest airliner ever-the DC-3.
5,"Beautiful, like Moorish architecture","Reviewer: A music fan from Seattle I have been to at least three of your concerts in the NW. Genetic Memories is my favorite album. I am particularly impressed with the way the rich arrangements bring together the instruments so well combined that they intertwine without piling up on each other. Each song stands complete by itself, but works in harmony with the others to create a very powerful, balanced experience. Very much like Moorish architecture! Your live performances achieve as much and more. We look forward to hearing the latest albums!!!"
3,Not Recommended for Children Under 4,"I purchased this Jellycat and the Spot Dog (black and white) huge. One for my niece (4 yrs old) and one for my nephew (2 yrs old). The listing said For All Ages. When I got them I looked at the tag and it said that they are not recommended for children under 4. But, in addition, this Dog was not wrapped in plastic as was the spot dog. It almost looked used and did not seem to me to be as well made. I'm keeping the Spot dog for my niece, and this Jellycat will be returned. I won't know how my niece likes her Jellycat until the holidays when she gets it. So I can only speak to what I'm hoping, which is that she will love to cuddle on it while watching Dora the Explorer."
5,These are wonderful!,"My grandson loves soft things and loves to roll around on this. I've even washed and dried in large washer and it came out great. Be careful of your animals, though, my two little dogs keep trying to steal it!"
4,Wicked Witch of the West,"This was a good Buffy book. It's about a new teacher that turns about to be something evil. (surprise, surprise)She's like a 3 thousand year old primitive witch who controls magic at her will and can ressurect into a new body at a time when powerful magic is being used (including Ancient Greece and the Salem Witch Trials)So Buffy and Company decide to destroy the primitive witch: once and for all. But it's not so easy when she's got Anya under her spell and has jumbled all of Willow's words pertaining to magick.And you thought your teacher was a witch..."
3,Not the best of the series,I enjoyed the book as it was like watching a Buffy Episode on TV. However I found that it is not one of my favourites of the series as others have been written better and with more depth. I do prefer the books written by Christopher Golden when it comes to the Buffy Series.The book did stick true to the characters and told an interesting tale of an ancient witch with true prime evil magic. Definitely worth a read for any true Buffy fan.
2,Not so cool,"This product was pretty cool, but after a couple of months the cables literally fell apart on me. I requested new cables from hp however the help line had no idea what this product was. Instead of receiving the parts I needed I got a new tuner, which didn't help at all. Since that fun experience I haven't been able to use my tv tuner. This product is very poorly made."
4,Shelter- Eternal,"This album came as a surprise to me, as i just assumed shelter had finally called it quits for good. when i finally got it, i was happy to hear that it is really a great album. the first song had me a bit worried that the songs would all sound the same and harken back to the days of ""when 20 summers pass"", which while i enjoy the album, isn't what i would consider their best. instead, the rest of the album really made me think more of ""the purpose, the passion"" and some of their early albums, in terms of different sounds, etc. while i still think mantra is their best album, this one goes high up there and i'm torn between giving it 4 and 5 stars... highly recommended for shelter fans and hardcore/post punk fans alike."
5,Anthem Punk,"I am NOT Hare Krishna, Straight Edge or Vegan although I do have a lot of respect for these cultures and the people who believe in them. But no matter how you slice it at the end of the day it's all about the music. That being said, Shelter is a very underrated band. I own several of their albums and they're all great including ""Eternal"" can't go wrong with great punk music with positive lyrics. Glad to see Ray Cappo is still at it."
5,Another great album by on of the best bands on the planet!,Shelter once again shows how great music really can be. A great punk album that you can really sing along with. Hare Krishna!
2,Product has changed - no longer of high quality,"I ordered this product in 2011 and was pleased with the quality, but when I ordered the same product in February of 2012, the product received is not the same. It is much less rigid. I don't have a way to measure weight, but if the product purchased in 2011 was 26 point, the current product is probably 18-20. Also, the mailers are side-loading, whereas the product received in 2012 was top-loading."
2,These aren't going to protect anything from the USPS.,"These mailers are very thin and aren't going to keep sensitive material from being bent, or perhaps even folded. If you're mailing letters, then they'll work fine. If you're sending something collectible that needs to stay flat throughout the postal process, you'll be cutting a few up to use as inserts for the one you actually use to mail them. Keep that in mind when evaluating the price per mailer."
2,Better than Vol 2,A couple of good songs - Pride and Spicks & Specks stand out. In the 60s I couldn't figure why Aussie acts flopped OS.Hearing this retro piece explained a lot. Mostly poor production values.
2,Poor quality,"This tape is thinner than professional gaffer's tape, does not tear as well, and leaves residue. In particular, it does not react well with water."
3,Good not Great,"As a professional full time photographer I use A LOT of gaffer's tape. This tape holds well and removes well, but it tear's off the roll with trouble. 90% of the time I tear off a section, it rips down the length while I'm trying to tear it off the roll. It happens enough that I probably will not buy this brand again."
5,"Great performance, great organ","These beloved pieces from the French Classical period are played in the church of St-Rémy, Dieppe, on the restored Parizot organ from 1739. The French tone-colour from this period is reflected accurately and although some people may have other opinions, no other type of organ could make these pieces come to life the way they do here; after all, one has to remember that this is the type of organ that Daquin composed these pieces for. Herrick's playing, as always, is marvelous. Highly recommended."
3,"Took some fiddling, but worked well in the end.","The set was a little tricky to master, but I fiddled with it for a while, and ended up making it work. I think the item I was adding a grommet to was too thin to work properly. A thicker material like a jean materials would have gone more smoothly I would imagine. The issue I had was that the punch would get stuck in the grommet and when I was able to extract it, the grommet would separate. Again, I was able to make it work with practice."
2,Smaller than advertised,"I received this kit, which I wanted for the tools. I then ordered some 5/16"" nickel-plated grommets that I ordered elsewhere. The inside diameter of the grommets that came with this kit was 1/4"". It says 5/16"" on the packaging so they didn't send the wrong set. Not happy. However, I gave the set two stars because the tools were reasonably good quality for a low-volume user. The included grommets were fine except for the small size.BTW, the inside diameter of the 5/16"" nickel-plated grommets I ordered elsewhere was 5/16"". Go figure."
4,"Personally good, factually flawed","Grimshaw tells an interesting and important story. She dispels many of the myths and orientalized perceptions Westerners have about monastic life in a Tibetan Buddhist community. Unfortunately, even though she presents herself as a former scholar, her facts about Tibetan history and philosophy are flawed and therefore distracting. Grimshaw makes numerous generalizations about Tibetan nunneries that are incorrect. Buy this book for a good story, and some lessons on the nature of suffering in a person's life, but buy Hanna Havenik's ""Tibetan Buddhist Nuns"" for factual information on Tibetan Buddhist nuns."
1,Useless,"Mine will give a range of 97-101 on the same person! I am a nurse, and know how to use this correctly. It is USELESS!"
3,"At Long Last: ""THE HUMAN COMEDY"" on CD","It's been too many years since this overlooked musical gem was available to fans. Based on the William Saroyan novella of the same name, MacDermot's score is, quite simply, glorious. His music soars, yet remains as Earth-bound as it's young hero and his family and friends. It's such a shame (and a great loss) that MacDermot didn't write more for the theatre, as few theatre composers (in my opinion) are able to match his gift for unpretentious melody. The songs, fragments, musical scenes, even the recitative are many steps above most of todays Sondheim-clones. THE HUMAN COMEDY is a must-have for any lover of American musical theatre."
1,"Not Even ""Of It's Time""","Disappointing. A ""rock opera"" that would have sounded dated if it were written in 1965. it is unsatisfying and totally out of keeping with the tenor of the libretto. I wish somebody would take Saroyan's novel and write a score that will endure the test of time."
5,Sleep tight,"I have fibromyalgia and have a very difficult time sleeping. I put ""Serenity"" on and listen with my earphones. It gently rocks me to sleep. A must have for relaxation!"
5,Overall Very Relaxing,"The music on this CD is very well done. Some tracks stand out more than others musically. The best feature however on this CD is the mix. It is probably the most perfectly produced recorded and mixed nature and music CD I have ever heard. The nature sounds fit perfectly with the music and while there are many bird sounds, there are never those annoying bird crazy tracks to contend with. It has a very nice variety of nature sounds as well as musical styles, while still maintaining the same feeling throughout the entire CD. Track #1, Greensleeves, is an amazing mix of the original song and piano variations and trills. Highly recommended for nature sound lovers and piano fans who like piano and keyboard played with other instruments."
4,Pretty Good,"I bought this CD because it seemed the closest to a Steven Halpern tape I bought when I was in college many years ago. I really like it. I could do without the first number ""Greensleeves"", but the rest of the pieces are excellent for meditation and relaxation. I've just never liked Greensleeves and I don't really know what it's doing in this album."
3,Email: A glimpse into the online microcosm,"I found this book fascinating. It makes it easy for those uninitiated in the online world to glimpse what it's like (I don't think being more graphic would have added anything); it shows us both the good and the bad. It's a fun place to play, but watch out. It can backfire on you. This book illustrates that wonderfully. I think the author did a great job here."
3,"an interesting, if tame, look into cybersex relationships","I found this an interesting attempt to explore the new and growing phenomena of cyber-relationships. I agree with the above review, that it is considerably 'tamer' than most of the chat rooms I've been in, and quite frankly, the email connection seems outdated now with the proliferation of real-time chat rooms, but it is an admirable attempt and speaks to how gullible and quick to trust so many people are. Having frequented a chatroom for sometime now, though not an 'adult-only' type chatroom, I can say that I take everything I 'hear' with more than a grain of salt. I enjoyed this book, though did find most of the characters a little naive, if not downright stupid in their actions. An interesting format, too, and it worked for me."
1,The worst book ever written.,"This book involves a complex entity of a relationship used bythe e-mail system. If Shanon does not chose this relationship thenshe should move on. I believe that this book was utterly stupid. Get a life!! Find your own romance that is live, and not through the internet or e-mail. The author is even dumb to have written a book on this subject let alone try and make it a romance. To me a romance should involve a time period that is historical or atleast involves some flashbacks into the past not some cyber reality."
3,"""I Am One?""","I really like the music to ""I Am One"" but I really don't understand the lyrics -- what do they mean? Can anybody tell me what the song is about?"
4,Last but not least,"""Whatever, whenever"" is Nick Kamen's last album so far. It's a totally forgotten album and, when released in May 1992, not very successful (I believe it was a complete flop). It's an enjoyable set of sensual dance pop songs, with some eastern influences on ""I'll find another way"" and on the highly erotically charged ""This time is our time"". ""We'll never lose what we have found"" was a great single and should have been a big hit - just like the album."
4,Merry Folger and her island are a great escape. . .,"I really enjoyed Death in A Mood Indigo, it was an atmospheric and absorbing story. Merry's character, a Sconset police detective is different than the usual hard edged policewomen that I read about. She has a feminine side, makes mistakes, and has a life (at least on weekends) aside from her police work. The other characters in this story, her father, grandfather, boyfriend Peter, the townspeople, victims, suspects and FBI agents are also well written and provide just the right mix for a great book. My only problem was that it was easy to guess who perpetrated the crime. I like to be surprised and I wasn't. I did run right out though, when I finished it, and purchased Death In A Cold Heard Light. I also tried to find her two earlier books that are alluded to in the story, but found that they are out of print-I ordered them anyway and am crossing my fingers that I eventually get them."
3,Enjoyable in spite of its faults,"The Nantucket setting is fresh and appealing, and the lead character Merry is likeable enough. Some of the professional choices she makes, however, are so unlikely and so obviously wrongheaded that they interrupted the flow of the reading for me -- I kept finding myself thinking ""a police detective wouldn't do that!"" I enjoy flawed and outspoken characters -- Kinsey Millhone comes to mind -- but a character's actions should be believable. Also, Merry's friends and family seem a little one-dimensional to me (the patient boyfriend, the stern but loving father, etc.); I hope these characters get more fleshed out as this series continues. As for the mystery itself, I figured out ""whodunit"" early in the book, which is always a bit disappointing. Still, I like Merry and the Nantucket setting and will take a chance on another book in this series. Hopefully, the author will choose to have Merry make more believable professional decisions next time."
4,Gives a good sense of place; filled out characters,"I purchased this in a Nantucket bookstore because I wanted to read a mystery with a local setting while on vacation. It rewarded me with well-drawn characters, a good sense of the seasonal changes on Nantucket and an interesting plot. I lowered the rating one star because I thought the killer's motivations were not sufficiently developed--maybe to prolong the suspense of who was the killer. Nevertheless, I would like to read the author's other titles including the Jane Austen mysteries."
3,Not as big a hit as i thought it would be,"My 6 year old daughter asked for this plane for christmas and so far (4 days later) she has only played with it for about 25 minutes tops....its kind of hard to play with considering it only holds 2 bratz at a time and there are 5 rock angelz bratz dolls. The my scene limo seems to function well for a child with a large doll collection (bratz, barbie or my scene) considering the fact that there is enough room for more than 2 dolls...This plane is huge and should be able to hold more than 2 dolls."
3,A must have... if you own all the rest!,"I bought this to complete my collection of Palladium Robotech titles, well knowing that this book is no more than a compilation of various ideas and suggestions most likely borne from suggestion of gamers and contributors.Yet, compared to the new, unworthy reissue Kevin Siembieda has served up in recent years, this classic role-playing game of big robot's battles in deep space par excellence, it is almost a masterpiece.recommended for those who loved the Sentinels setting - absolutely native as it was made &#8203;&#8203;in Palladium; purists of the animated series produced by Harmony Gold in the 80s would be better to abstain."
2,waste of money,"I purchased this toy and although we had fun putting it together, it did not run as was advertised. The final models were flimsy and would not hit the wheels to spin it properly. Sure you can sit there and force ti ti go but that is not what they advertise. I built the pitrate ship that is suppose to go 360 degrees. couldn't even go back and forth without help. today we built the g-force ride. Very flimsy and again will not go without your adjustments and you sitting there coaxing it. Although it is good for children to learn to read the directions; the toy does not live up to its billing. Basically I think it is a waste of money. Tom"
1,waste,I could not get the ship to get on track. Sure you can forse it to go.that's not how it's advertised. Don't waste your money like I did.
5,"Quick, easy and reliable","This thermometer is really easy to use and really fast measuring the temperature. When having a baby, is really hard to keep the baby from moving when those old style thermometers measure their temperature, wich can take up to 4 minutes. But this one is ligthning fast, it takes only 1 second! I recommend that to all of those with kids at home!"
3,Using for infant,After purchasing this item I learned that it is difficult to get an accurate reading on infants (under 12 months) using these thermometers. It's definitely true with this one. I've never had a reading above 96 for my 5 month old son.
2,Not Accurate (Too High),"Got this last week. Tested it out on my family and also for myself only compared with the oral thermometer we have been using. I don't mind the variability, which seems to be roughly plus/minus 0.5 degree F. What I don't like is that it seems to average about 1.5 degrees F too high. Specifically, the oral has me at 98.7 but the first 5 repeats with Safety 1st ranged from 99.9 to 101. My wife's readings also came in over 100. Maybe we just got a bad one."
1,Don't waste your money to buy this item,"When I'm pregnant my first baby, I read the review and bought this one. But it's really hard to use it, each time I test my temperature the temperature came out different, so I was so scare and buy teh Vicks for rectum thermometer. I really like the Vick one, it's simple, easy, fast and cheapDon't waste yoru money with it, buy a simple one will save your headached"
3,Black Tambourine,"Black Tambourine has this bittersweet charm about them. Just think the surreal female vocals of shoegazing bands like Lush, Medicine, or Bleach, combined with the crunchy walls of guitars of The Jesus And Mary Chain or early Ride. Black Tambourine falls somewhere in between the Cocteau Twins and My Bloody Valentine, and that's not necessarily a bad thing."
5,Programming in Matlab,The placement and delivery of this order both went smoothly and I was satisfied. The book was shipped on time and arrived on time. The service level met my expectation.
4,good book,"this book gave me a good support to find out how started withmatlab programming, but I consider that should better for all users if this book had showing more examples, in matter fact I had been reading it and is a good source of knowledge."
4,MUST HAVE CD,THIS WAS THE FIRST PARLIAMENT CD I GOT AND I TELL YOU IT IS GOOD FOR FIRST TIME PARLIAMENT LISTERNS IT IS A GREAT CD TO OWN
3,"Good value, but Gold is better","Parliament had long funk songs so this budget album is actually around 70 minutes long. However, Parliament Gold is 2CDs and less than twice the price so I suggest you go with it instead. Gold also has the 10 minute version of Flash Light (my favorite track) instead of the 5 minute version that's on this one."
4,Good CD,"This CD is very good introduction to Parlaiment. It has very good selection of songs and it is funkin' good. ""Give Up The Funk"", ""Mothership Connection"", and especially my favorite ""Get Up For the Down Stroke"". It is good value, so buy the CD."
4,Back In The Day,"I love all the 70's R&B.; This is just one, I keep in the car to jam to. I remember crusing to Savannah Beach Georgia lsitening to Flashlight and Tear the Roof Off The Sucker in my 1968 MustangClass of 78Windsor Forest High School"
5,Fantastic Book,"This book is not just for those that are violent in life. This book is for everyone! It can be used in every setting, every day, with all people young and old. A true mastery of communication skills and listening skills. I love it! I would highly recommend it for all walks of life whether you go to work or work at home. Enjoy! The workbook is great also."
1,ultra basic with little practical use,The dither surrounding this workbook is unwarranted. There is little need in the world for such stilted speech.
2,"If you read the book, this workbook is just a review of it","I liked the NVC (Non Violent Communication) book, but the workbook fell short of expectations. It had a chapter by chapter homework assignment, and sometimes the questions were not necessary ""NVC is also known by the title ___"" (one answer is Giraffe Language). I expected the Workbook to offer guidelines on refining and practicing the technique, rather than simply reviewing the chapters of the book. I read the book, I understood it, I retained it. I didn't need the workbook. There are excellent components of the workbook also - some of the thought-provoking questions were helpful in deepening my understanding. I read the workbook and did the exercises, reviewing some in an NVC group. I feel disapointed because the book was more of a review than I expected it to be. I would like to see another workbook that has more exercises to develop greater skill in the NVC techniques."
2,Not impressed,"The book is good, but the workbook was geared for use as an instructors guide for class. There were individual studies, but it was a small amount and very limited. It wasnt very helpful."
4,Perfect complement for KHT 3005 sats,"Solid, unobtrusive, great mounting system for KHT satellites. Why not a five? Unable to adjust speaker height. That said, these stands provide an elegant solution for placing the satellites ""just so""."
5,A difference of opinion.,"I enjoy music of many backgrounds. I enjoyed this CD. I can not listen to any one type of music played all day, My wife did not."
1,Not made very well,"I bought this for my son last Christmas,I called the company and 3 different times was sent pin replacements and it still kept getting stuck.If they would of made it better without having the pins get stuck up it would of been a great game.My 7 year old was disappointed in it."
2,"POOR DESIGN, DOES NOT WORK.","I purchased this for my son that had to have from santa, well guess what, It dosen't work, The pins get hung every frame, he is upset.I had to explain to him sometimes things that santa brings needs help too. I am taking this toy that is of poor construction back to Toys R Us. I thought they tested toys for children??? They missed this one for sure."
1,ARCADE ALLEY BOWLERADE IS THE WORST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this toy on Christmas eve of 2003 and when we put it together it worked just fine until a couple days or weeks later it just instantly broke.The ball is 95% likely not to weigh even 10 ounces.It would just be easier to go bowling at a real bowling alley where all of the score keeping and ball return actually work instead of paying $50 for an arcade alley bowlercade rec-room game that will just break instantly.signed,THE KID WHO HATES THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,electronic bowlercade,"My 4 year old son received this for Christmas and LOVES it. It is great for the 3-6 year range, beyond that and a child would be bored. It has an automatic ball return and keeps score digitaly. Draw backs are that it is not overly sturdy so if you throw the ball too hard the pins can drop out. But overall lots of fun."
5,My son has never played with a toy this long!,"My son got this as a Christmas present (2006). He turned 22 months the day before. He loves watching bowling on TV and being at the bowling alley, but he's too young to actually bowl at the bowling alley. When we put this toy together, he was so excited, he saw the picture on the box! He played for hours! He has NEVER lasted for more than about 5 minutes with one toy. It was amazing! I love it and so does he!"
2,Very Disappointed Mom....,"I bought this game for my 3 yr old son. He loves bowling in a real bowling alley so i thought this would be a nice game to have at home until having the game for 2 days and the return dont work properly(gets stuck),arcade sounds not that great and very easy to come apart(my son was very able to take the pins off). Returned it to the store and luckly they took it back cause it cost me 60 bucks and to have it lie around (eventually in pieces) would have drove me nuts. Do not buy this game, not worth the aggravation or money......"
4,Arcade Alley Bowlercade,"After I read the reviews on this toy, I wanted to cancel my order. Thankfully I didn't because my kids love it. I have two boys 5 & 9 and they love bowling with this toy. My kids have played with it since we got it in Feburary. In the reviews, people said the toy broke soon after playing with it. My kids play with it all the time and we have not had any problems. Everything still works great; the pins, the sound, and the ball return."
2,Not Happy With Quality or Challenge of Game,"So you are pretty much guaranteed a strike every role. My four year olds got bored with it very quickly. The ball return does NOT work and never did. And after three days, the pins no longer come down either. The system is a bust. Can not get anyone on the line at the manufactuer. Phone system automatically kicks you to a voice mail box that has been full since 12/27/03 when I first started calling. Impossible to find out any info on the company. The instructions state NOT to take the unit back to the place of purchase if there is a problem but to contact them directly at their toll-free number. Wish I could!"
1,Bowlercade is a bust!,"My daughter received this item for Christmas from Santa. It was such a huge disappointment. The alley is very small and narrow. The ball is so light weight my child had a tendency to be able to throw the ball down the alley instead of roll it and she is only 5 years old. The worst part is that the ball return did not work at all. I exchanged the toy 3 times and the ball return never worked consistently or properly. I would not recommend purchasing this toy at all. It is more fun to just go to a real bowling alley, it is less frustrating!"
2,What a pain!,"Before I bought this my kids used to set up water bottles in the kitchen as bowling balls and now....they still do! I bought this game 2 years ago and it has been used ONE time! The set up wasn't too bad(although it took some time). My then 13 year old nephew did it! However, our house just isn't big enough to keep it set up. When I purchased it I wrongly assumed that the manufacturer would make a SEVEN FOOT game storeable! Boy was I wrong! With a 7 and 4 year old, who have an attention span of roughly 10 minutes, it never seemed worth it to re-assemble.So, if you have a lot of space to fill this really is a fun game. If not, avoid this game. It's not very fun stored in a closet."
2,Missing instructions,We bought this for our kids for Christmas. Of course we open the box on Christmas Eve at 10PM to put it together and there are no instructions! It looks easy but without instructions we are not sure about the pins etc. Could someone post the phone number of the company so we can call them. Tomorrow morning should be interesting!Merry Christmas....
2,Nice at first...hour that is,"We just got this toy from Santa took about a half hour to get together, not too bad and it was really fun...until the front pin mount snapped off, I can see if teenages were beating the thing up..it might be an excuse but the plastic if flimsy and cheap...nice idea...cheaply made. Wouldnt recommend unless you want to throw your money away."
2,I Do Not Recommend! Poor design!,"I purchased the bowling game and my 6 year old daughter loved to play with it. She thought it was fun (to her). To an adult the game doesn't work properly, the display doesn't display the numbers properly, the construction of the game is very weak. It falls apart easily, even under regular play. But, with kids they are enjoying themselves and not interested in the function of the game. If the game was redesigned for young children, and all the bells and whistles worked --- I would re-purchase the game!"
2,"Great Concept, but poorly made","This toy is an awesome idea. My kids loved the idea of it. The pins resetting was awesome as was the ball return. the only problem is within less than two days the pins broke off and could not be fixed. I tried contacting the maker with no luck. Needless to say it is in the garbage and long gone. An incredible idea, but not worth the price for a day or two of fun."
3,Who Was Leonardo da Vinci?,"The friends at my school read Who Was? Books too. so, i decided to read them and they're SO COOL! I Own 12 Who Was? Books and have read 18. Who Was? Books are so popular at my school. My friend that i was talking about read all the Who Was? Books and has 16."
4,Great for reluctant readers,"My 12-year-old hates reading on his own with a passion. So when he had to do a biogragphy on Leonardo for school, we both dreaded the process. He got a book from the school library and tried to wade through it, but he wasn't getting much usable information out of it because it was too long and complicated. I ordered this book four days before his assignment was due as a last desperate measure. Boy were we glad I did! This book was wonderful for my reluctant reader. It was informative but not overwhelming for a child who doesn't like to read. The basic information on Leonardo was enhanced with illustrations, timelines and information boxes on the Renaissance. I would highly recommend this book."
5,Great subject for a children book.,Great subject for a children book. I got this series of books for my daughter and she really enjoyes reading them. Great read and educational too.
4,the spiritual in art: abstract painting 1890 - 1985,"There is a fantastic quality to the compliation of works in the Spiritual in Art, that indicates a profound understanding of the mystical forces of inspiration involved with the process of artistic endeavor. The book chronicles the exhibition of the same name organized by Maurice Truchman and Judi Freeman at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Many of the major artists of the 20th century are represented; Mondrian, Duchamps and Kandinsky to name a few. The ideosyncratic spin to the show lies in the examination of their work from a philospophical and spiritual standpoint that involves a more involved examination than is often given with the popular criticism styles of art history - ie; socio-political and aesthetic. With the aid of this book, the reader gleans a more profound understanding of the motivational forces at work in these artists whose creations transport viewers to new worlds and dimensions with only a glance."
2,Gets Fuzz Balls,"Of all the crib sheets I received this was my least favorite. I registered for it because it matched the crib set. Color is accurate, size is fine. After about 4 washes it got those little balls of fuzz all over it. It is not that soft either. Would not buy for a friend or get a second one."
4,More relevant for the inventor today than you can imagine,"I picked up this book on a whim, and found myself agog at Morse's veritable precognition about the telecommunication industry. I was quite unable to put the book down. This man may be long dead, but his ideas about leasing the right to use his telegraph, rather than opting to sell telegraph devices one-by-one, was a brilliant marketing decision on a par with today's great master's of business. The book is well-written and full of surprises, including what business decisions NOT to make. This is a great read for anyone who a)is in marketing; b) is in telecommunication; or c)mistrusts the Patent Office!"
5,A Great Album,"An excellent album, their third. I wish they would make a fourth. If you like ""Dance Hall Days"" and ""Everybody Have Fun Tonight"", you should get this one. I believe it is their best."
3,Land of the Mountain and Flood,"""Land of the Mountain and the Flood"" is Hamish MacCunn's best known work. The version on this cd is absolutely wonderful. This is one of the few cd's that focuses exclusively on MacCunn. It is wonderful to get to hear a selection of his other work. The cd includes excerpts from his opera Jeanie Deans. MacCunn emerges as an extremely gifted composer. The excessive Romanticism of some of these pieces is a bit alienating for me, but on the whole this cd is an excellent tribute to Scotland's greatest Romantic composer."
3,"Nice material, bad insert shape","This brace is made of comfortable canvas material, but the metal bracing insert is shaped in a puzzling and uncomfortable way.It offers some level of support, but with the bad insert shape it's hard to recommend it because I've tried some other braces that while not necessarily being made of a material as comfortable as this brace have a more comfortable bracing shape to them."
3,Ballet Lunch box,"nice soft lunch box. A bit big for a backpack, but very durable and hold up in the laundry if need be."
3,Review of the reviews,"Unfortunately, most of these reviews sound very much like marketing sound bytes. Has anyone really read this?"
4,Good,"A must read book that deals with sexual problems in an easy and understandable way. A great read even for men that don't have sexual problems because it teaches them what to expect from life and not to give up. A far better book in my opinion is ""Natural Penis Enlargement: New Methods of Avoiding and Curing Impotence, Premature Ejaculation, and Erectile Dysfunction Safely and Inexpensively. New ... No Pumps, No Pills and No Gadgets! Vol. 2"" by Platinum Millennium, one of the best books on them market that i liked very much"
3,Nothing beyond the basics,"The book covers the basics of impotence: physcial and psychological causes. The authors seem to emphasize the psychological more so. Yet their therapeutic suggestions in this area are just about nonexistent.Their discussion of Viagra is just poor; it is not connected well to their previous chapters. What physical and emotional problems can Viagra overcome and to what degree? Or how long do the effects of Viagra last; all that is stated is how long it takes to become effective. Something is needed beyond the minimal.The book just does not go past the first level in anything. All in all, I would certainly hope that there is a better book out there for the lay person."
4,We Gotta Wrestle,"An imported album basically a copy of WWF: The Music Volume 2. Included is Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts entrance theme as well as the complete PG-13 Rap in The Nation of Domination's entrance music. Included is a Sunny poster and Fan stickers. This album slightly surpasses Volume 2."
3,Focused on Virtuosity,"I have bought several Hamelin CDs recently - this one, Scriabin and the Composer Pianists. All are benchmarks for technique. Perhaps the ease with which he navigates the obstacles is the problem, I just don't get the feeling that his heart is in it. And I'm tired of hearing his recurring mantra about how virtuosity is artistry in itself. I don't agree. While I'm happy to hear how he avoids the pounding that Ashkenazy inflicts on Scriabin, he could use more of Vladimir's emotion. Perhaps I just don't ""get along"" with his style well enough. I think he's trying too hard to be different. If you want to hear breathtaking technical performance and excellent recorded sound, then by all means, this is a great choice."
2,Not Too Good,"A psychotic woman becomes dangerously jealous when her best friend begins dating a handsome man. She will stop at nothing to keep the two apart, even if it means destroying their relationship or even murdering one of them."
4,Non-thinking fun,"If your a fan of the genre or the cast you can do worse then watch this. Kate (kari Wuhrer) hears her only real friend Sara (Farrah Forke) is getting married, since Kate is in love with Sara this is bad news. So Kate heads off to pay her a visit - complete with gun. However being close to Sara only strenthens Kates fixation, so much so that Kate turns to flirtation, lying, even murder, in order to win Sara's love. Sure you know how the movie is going to end but considering the small budget used KA is pretty impressive."
3,Has its ups and downs,"I started with their most recent album, ""Looking out the Fishbowl,"" which was so addictive that I couldn't even listen to anything else for two solid weeks. After that, ""I Rode Fido Home"" , while still a good album, was a relative letdown. It has its moments, when that EFO catchiness and quality shines through as strong as anywhere else, but it has several songs that just don't soar."
2,Sorry...,"I'm sorry. I really wanted to like this album. I really wanted to like this band. No luck on either account. I found the songwriting... insipid. (Sorry!) They had the quality of a couple of relatively good college-age dudes hacking around on guitar and writing songs. They were ""good"", but that's all. Not great. ""Mistress Snow and Mary Jane Green"" successfully incorporates a number of different drug references, but it sounds like it was written by someone who never actually ""did"" drugs, they just heard about it secondhand. (As if I wrote a rap about keepin in real in da hood - NOT!) ""Jupiter"" was similar... sounded like the best effort of a hipster at SUNY-Plattsburg. The rest of the album was similarly uninspiring. If I had seen them live I wouldn't have bought the CD."
2,it's okay,"There really isn't much to it. It is okay, though. just not great. I prefer and1 or the new legends. Better action and stuff. The good thing is that it is about streetball and I am a streetball fan. Much better dvds out there and I have them all."
5,Destined to remain obscure?,"I saw the video for ""Twenty Two Bar"" a few times when I was in France in 1995. It was a charming video and a charming song, and my interest was definitely piqued. I asked my friends who Dominique A was; nobody seemed to know. I began to look around for the CD, but couldn't find it (unfortunately I was in a smallish city not exactly renowned for its record shopping.) Anyway, long story short, found the album on amazon.com, bought it just for one song, but don't regret the purchase at all: There's not a duff track on here. Now I just want to know one thing: Whatever happened to Dominique A?"
5,French singer of this century,You should listen to Dominique A if you want to know what is the current best french singer.
1,Emotive Theology,"I hate books on liturgics or liturgical theology that use strings of adjectives to construct paragraphs. This work elevates that form of writing to an art form! Liturgical/sacramental theology is THE source of renewal for the church today, especially the small inner city congregation. This work does NOTHING to move the cause along."
1,Horrible - 0.3 mile range,"I understood when I purchased this item that I probably wouldn't get anything close to a 16 mile range for these walkie talkies, however, I didn't expect to only get 0.3 mile. We live in a residential area (no skyscrapers or large powerlines) and I was very disappointed when the signal went from clear to static after about 4 blocks. I called Motorola technical support and they indicated that was a common complaint.If range is a concern,don't waste your money on this product."
3,Good pacifier,I bought this pacifier because they don't have this exact brand and size in silicone. My daughter took to it quickly. It does wear and tear faster than silicone. I recommend the nuk genius if you are looking for a pacifier for a child greater than 18 months and want silicone.
3,Celebrating the underdog,"An Italian barber in Stamford refusing to become a rich WASP? Come on! Learning to become a WASP could be easier - and certainly more satisfying - then learning a razor cut. In the Vietnamese jungle, the American soldiers are a bunch of dunderheads, and the only one who knows what's up and survives is the little old native. The stories are well witten. Pity, that the aim is so off-center."
2,not like the registry,I read the other reviews for this book and thought this was definitely what I needed to pass my abdomen registry. -wrong!! I read and studied every chapter. I took the tests. I did the review cd and took the tests on that as well. I made almost perfect scores on the review tests. Needless to say today when I took the exam I did not pass. The questions on the registry are much harder than in this book and a lot of the questions brought up things this book didn't even mention.Also I thought the registry had a lot of abdominal vasculature and doppler questions on it. Moreso than I thought it would based on percentages. .. Oh well. Maybe it was just my test .. :(
1,Review Book Images,"I liked the outlined material, it was in a simple and easy to study form. However, the ARDMS uses ultrasound images frequently on the exam and therefore image review is a very useful tool in preparing. The images in this book were totally undiagnostic. I have been a registered sonographer for many years and could not make out the images. Being that image review is such a critical part of the ARDMS test, I would personally recommend a book that has better images to review."
2,Apparently not that great!,I used this book along with one other to study for my abdomen boards which I took today--and failed! The book is not a close equivalent to the registry at all. The other book was probably of more help than this one.
5,Abdminal Review Book,"This book is an excellent resource for those reviewing the abdominal ultrasound subject for the exam. Also it gives great hints on how to answer the multiple choice answers, which are sometimes so tricky. I recommend it to all candidates out there."
2,Pay for what you get,"Nice belt for $14.95...but pretty cheap...a person can tell that the ""leather"" is a synthetic derivative and subsequently would wear out as such.."
3,Maybe I'll Come Home in The Spring,If you're a baby boomer and a fan of the 70's ABC movies then this classic Sally Field movie worth seeing again.
4,It was good and interesting.,"I am 15. My mother ordered this movie, I didn't mind because I love all movies, especially ones from the sixties and seventies. I enjoyed this video. I thought Sally Field was excellent and I thought Lane Bradbury was wonderful as her hippie sister."
3,Entertaining,"Not great, but nice to see a very young Sally Field, after Flying Nun but before Norma Rae. Also has two seasoned vets - Eleanor Parker, who by this time was not getting movie roles, but her classic beauty is very much on display and Jackie Cooper, former child star."
4,"Wow, all the memories this movie back!","If I remember right, this was a movie of the week. I was blown away by the clothes, cars and hippie.... stuff. Oh, the memories this brought back. If you were around at all during the Haight/Ashbury days and knew anyone that was experimenting with the scariest of drugs or had run away from home, this will be a movie to bring all of that back."
4,Nostalgic rush...,"Right from the opening scene of teenaged-runaway, Dennie, stumbling back toward home and Linda Ronstadt's beautiful voice( yep, that's her) singing the title song... this movie captured the angst of the 70's American teen and family. MAYBE I'LL COME HOME IN THE SPRING is like a snapshot in time.Thoroughly watchable today and...just as pertinent.ajm57"
5,i dont know,poo poooo im not sure but im trying to find out if this is th movie on the book go ask alice.
1,Corny and Stupid,"This movie was corny,stupid and poorly made 30 years ago and today it's unwatchable. After fastforwarding thru most of this turkey, I put it back in its box and then threw the box in the garbage."
2,Terrible Sound,"Texas songster Mance Lipscomb was one of the great discoveries of the 1960s folk blues revival. Born in 1895, he was not recorded until 1960, after which he cut a number of albums for Arhoolie. He was a great guitarist with an enormous repertoire, from childrens' songs through popular dance tunes to hard Texas blues numbers, and his recordings should be in the collection of any blues fan.However, this 1964 album should be avoided. The main drawback is the dire sound quality - an excessively echoey acoustic (which makes the album sound as if it was recorded inside a grain silo) plus a harshness alien to Lipscomb's style.All these tracks were recorded by Lipscomb elsewhere, and any of the Arhoolie albums are far preferable to this CD. Avoid it!"
5,"A practical, easy-to-follow, effective resource","Written by business attorney Shelly Waxman for the non-specialist general reader, All Anybody Needs To Know About Independent Contracting is an informed and informative guide to capitalizing on the Employment Revolution to escape the traps of wage-slavery and excessive taxes. From the necessary requirements to fulfill for independent contractor status, to tax saving tips, to protocols for setting up one's business, All Anybody Needs To Know About Independent Contracting is commended as being a practical, easy-to-follow, effective resource for readers of all educational or business backgrounds."
5,"What a man, What a life","I am a blues fan and I thought this would be as far back in the beginnings as anyone should have to go. I wanted to know something of the man who brought the blues to the American mainstream. Wow, what a story. I don't care if you have any interest in the music at all, just as an American this was a great story. What a film this would be.Forget the blues, and all he did for music, and you are still left with an amazing man who did more than I would have thought possible in the time he lived. This story was so much more than I bargained for. Inspiring, funny, and IMPRESSIVE. And in the mans own words.I loved it!Daniel Vickery"
5,Awesome,This bag was awesome and my boyfriend love it:) the bag even shipped to me pre filled the only bad thing was that it took forever to ship
3,Somewhat misleading,"This book is arranged as a dictionary, although somewhat slender. It does not provide the reader with general names, but with actual names of persons, places, and things of the past (i.e. Alexander the Great, William the Conqueror, Edward the Lawgiver, Normandy, etc.). Basically, this book, for most of its entries, does not list the meanings and origins of the names that it contains. It is merely a quick reference book for someone who has trouble remembering people, places, and things in history. Its definitions and descriptions are also quite short. Don't purchase this book if you are looking for an actual dictionary that lists, describes, and defines first and/or last names."
5,"Simple, yet, complete","I started studying Fuzzy Logic without the help of anyone else trough this book, and I fully recommend it if this is your case.The book gives simple examples to explain abstract terms, without being shallow. The mathematic rigorousness grows in a pattern that anyone is able to follow. Whenever some concept is shown to you, a simple example help you understand.It's a little book with a lot in it. If you want to learn Fuzzy Logic from the scratch, this is the greatest start point that I know."
2,Kindle Version Needs Editor,"The book itself is great (I had been reading a borrowed paperback copy until I bought the kindle version). It's concise and readable without sacrificing substance. However, it looks like the kindle version was created by an incompetent computer program--the formatting is terrible."
4,Well worth the price,The ten Lone Ranger episodes (five in color) make it well worth the price. The episodes (with their original air dates):9/9/1954 The Fugitive2/24/1955 The Law Lady5/5/1955 Wanted: The Lone Ranger6/9/1955 The Swami9/1/1955 One Nation Indivisible9/13/1956 The Wooden Rifle10/25/1956 The Return of Don Pedro O'Sullivan11/29/1956 Twisted Track1/3/1957 Outlaw Masquerade5/9/1957 Journey to San Carlos
1,gotta be bad,"Any new Lone Ranger DVD's out there now since the take over way back when, are Classic Media versions shown on the Western Channel. This could go back to when Golden Books had the rights. Either way, the episodes have been cut up, shortened, time compressed, and altered, and original material trashed never to be restored again. The only complete original episodes could be in someones home library taped maybe 30 years ago, when VCR'S made their first appearance, (You know, the 40-50 pound models,) from an independent channel as I did. The only complete, as shown originally in 1949, version of the first 3 episodes, ""Enter the Lone Ranger"", I am aware of is a 76 minute tape I purchased in 1986-87 is an LP speed from GOODTIMES. Even the 75th Anniversary edition is flawed and for the most part,is The Western Channel versions as described above. It's too bad The Western Channel could not restore an American icon as they did The Gene Autry shows. It would have been more appreciated."
1,buyer beware!,"This book is very small and thin with a cheap hardback cover like you'd find on any child's book. Certainly not worth more than the $12.95 price that's printed on the barcode on the back of the book. Unfortunately, I paid $68.99 for the book and my kids gave it to my dad before I had time to pay close attention. I had expected a nice keepsake journal for the price...the actual product does not come anywhere close to my expectations.I'm an Amazon prime member and love, love, love shopping on this website. However, I found it very disappointing that Amazon would have a seller with such exboritant markups on its site."
1,deceiving title,"The title...The Grandparents' Treasure Chest: A Journal of Memories to Share with Your Grandchildren...is very deceiving. I sent this to my mother from my two children for Mother's day...thinking it was a book for more than one grandchild, as the title led me to believe. When she received the book, she said that all the questions are presented in such a way that it can only be for one grandchild. I purposely bought it because it was the only one I THOUGHT was for more than one grandchild."
3,The closer,As usual Mr. Connelly holds your interest in this book as he does in all his other writings. I have never been disappointed with a novel by Michael Connelly.
4,Classic Connelly,Great book from start to finish. Bosch is a little rusty but he is back where he belongs... the murder table.
4,Is Harry Getting Too Self-Righteous?,"This is a tight, tense entry in the series. One of the best, and I've read them all. But Harry seems never to give the benefit of the doubt to other cops. Why not just stick him in IAD and get it over with?"
4,Solid Detective Novel,"Connelly gives a straightfoward mystery-detective read that provides a linear storyline of the detectives solving a 17-yr old murder mystery. This novel comes without frills, tangents and extraordinary events. The story is consistent in realism and in maintaining readers' interest. Readers enjoy a fly-on-the-wall view of detectives struggling to break the case. ""Closers"" is smartly written and is succinct and to the point. I enjoyed it and appreciate Connelly's skill in writing the seemingly precise amount of words for his purpose...he is not wordy and his story is not lacking."
5,Harry Bosch Returns,"Michael Connelly is perhaps the finest writer in this genre. Whereas Grisham books always read like a screenplay for a television thriller, Connelly reads like Harry Bosch is a real detective and is discussing his memoirs. I know law enforcement people who have quit because of political pressures and corruption inside a department, so the background of this book is very believable.Harry is not a super sleuth, he's not Lucas Davenport driving a Porsche, he's an everyday Harry who slogs through the work day trying to do some good in spite of the rules.I would recommend the Bosch series to anyone. I've read other Connelly books, but Harry is the only one who is a friend that I look forward to meeting with again.Great book, great writing, solid story."
4,Another Great Page Turner From Connelly,"Michael Connelly writes some of the best suspense you can find these days. Great stories, great characters, and great pace. I was reading this book on a flight home from New York and I actually found myself hoping for some sort of delay! Very entertaining."
4,Lost But Not Forgotten,"Mr. Connelly weaves a relatively tight mystery in the this book. The characters are realistic and the story is multi-faceted. The book centers around the return of Detective Harry Bosch and his involvement in the ""unsolved"" cases of the city of Los Angeles.Bosch and his partner Rider team up again to try to solve a 17 year old case. With significantly intricate Police work, aided by a DNA match that points them toward the murder, but not directly at the murder works well in the book.One item that seems a bit redundant in the book is the use of the victim's name ""Verloren."" Transparently, directly translated from the German the name means ""Lost"" or ""Wasted."" While it certainly is applicable, it appears in the text about 700 times and becomes just a little too omnipresent.The story is captivating and interesting. It is in the vein of the very good detective writers of today, and even yesterday. All readers of the Detective Genre would find this book interesting."
3,Disappointed,"Love the Harry Bosch series, however this one really fell short. Was half way through the book when it stopped and started on another book about Harry but neither one was finished. Prior to downloading to my Kindle it didn't state there would be two separate books otherwise I would not have done so."
4,"Excellent Reading, Great Mystery......","Connelly does it again with an excellent Harry Bosch story. Harry comes out of a short retirement to work on closed cases with his former partner Kiz Rider. The two take the reader on an excellent adventure as Harry and Kiz work to solve a seventeen year old murder of a young girl.You will be treated to twists and turns in the investigation that keep you thinking and questioning the two detectives methods and motives. When they are finally on the right track the story begins to unfold rather quickly and then the chase is on to get the killer, which again leads the reader through another series of excitement as you read the story. However the story does not just end with the capture of the killer. If your curiosity has peaked now I suggest you pick up a copy of the book and read it. You won't be disappointed I can assure you."
5,Book sale,I wish I had noticed that the book was in paperback form; I thought I had bought a hardcovered bookThe item was as stated. And I appreciated the fast delivery
4,Easy read with some substance to it,"Harry Bosch returns from retirement to join the LAPD's Unsolved Crimes Unit. Bosch's first case back involves the 20-year-old murder of a biracial girl in an upscale neighborhood of LA.Connelly is a great writer of police stories, and I've read most if not all of the Harry Bosch series. This one was another page turner with an interesting mystery and good portrayal of Bosch's righteousness, which can border on the obsessive. There wasn't much about Harry's personal life this time, which was OK with me.The writing in this outing would make The Closers ideal for a beach or airplane read. Connelly chose to write this book in very simple declarative sentences which makes the reading go very fast, though at times the prose became so stylized as to border on self-parody.Recommended to fans of the series.Reviewer: Elizabeth Clare, co-author of the historical novel ""To the Ends of the Earth: The Last Journey of Lewis and Clark"""
3,Very entertaining,"I would have given the book at least 4 stars, but in the end, one murder was just left untouched. We know who did it, but it was never stated in the book, therefore left with loose ends.Other than that, it was a very good book with many lines of suspense, and in the end our friend, Harry Bosch, comes out all right."
4,Bosch lite,"3.5 stars. Bosch is back...kind of. For a Connelly whodunit, this book didn't have as many twist and turns and one is used to when picking up a Bosch mystery. I find I miss the first person take, mainly because there were so many passages of telling instead of showing. I honestly don't understand the killer's motive to return to the scene of the crime, nor why he hadn't gotten rid of the one person who could have tied him to the crime a long time ago. Overall, this is an easy read-not Connelly's best. I hope this doesn't mean that series is going to on the decline; it's one of the long running series out there that's still decent."
4,One of the best of the series,"I liked this one. Connelly had been suffering with some mediocre additions to the Bosch series and he brought the level back up with this one.Good plot, good characterizations, believeable dialogue, nice pace.This is one of the better of the series."
4,He's BAAAAACK,"Three years after his retirement, Harry Bosch is invited back to join the Open/Unsolved Unit for the LAPD. He is part of a team whose sole focus is to try to close old cases. Harry gets a case of a teenage girl drug from her home and apparently killed behind her house up on Oat Mountain. When he finds DNA evidence that points to a small-time crook, Harry pushes farther, unsatisfied with what he has discovered. What he finds out will shock you.Like all of the Harry Bosch books, this is fairly dark and full of twists and turns that will keep you turning the pages long past your normal light's out. Don't miss it!"
3,Harry not at his best.,"The twists and turns of the Closers are more predictable than most Bosch stories. The characters development is typical Connelly, you get what you see, naked and relevant. His discription of Los Angeles and its land marks,earily on target, remind this Angelino of the past and the present.In every Bosch novel, Harry is the MAN against the odds. The White Knight in a dark world. A mountain of distractions and the political power bases are always limiting his purpose. But this time the odds are just a little to long and powerful for the ending to work as well as most Bosch endings do. Still a enjoyable read."
2,Lackadaisical procedural work,Straight line procedural detective work by an officer just doing a day's work. Lack of personal motivation throughout this story deadens it. For value-driven characters try a Harlan Coben novel.
3,good but predictable,"nice book, but they are starting to become very much 'color by number'. Michael Connelly is one of the best author's around, but the lincoln lawyer series is not as predictable as this one. I love Harry, but it needs some variety and suspence. I like the addition of his daughter."
4,The Closers,I truly enjoyed this book I just wish they didn't swear in it Connelly's other books were wonderful with out it.
4,Bosch is back,Harry Bosch is back on the force after two years of retirement.His mission: solving cold cases. This is a well-written novel but lacks the zing of Connelly's earlier work. I figured out the perp about two thirds through even though the focus remained on other suspects.At places this novel dragged a bit but still a good read. Connelly remains one of my favourite authors.
3,3 1/2 Stars -- Entertaining But Far From Connelly's Best Work!,"In The Closers Detective Harry Bosch is back with the LAPD working on trying to close unsolved cases. On his first case back on the force he is attempting to solve the death of a teenaged girl from almost two decades ago. Connelly's above average writing skills makes The Closers an entertaining read. However, in contrast to many of Connelly's other books, The Closers has fewer surprises, a lot less action and is notably more predictable in regards to guessing the outcome. If you are a fan of Connelly's and his Harry Bosch character, I think you'll find The Closers to be a satisfying read. However, if this is your first Harry Bosch mystery I don't think reading this book will motivate you to want to rush out to read other books in the series. In my opinion this would be a mistake since most of the other Harry Bosch mysyeries are very good-to-excellent."
3,"""Closer"" But No Cigar","As a conventional example of the police procedural, ""The Closers"" is pretty good. But ""conventional"" is not a word I would ever have thought to attribute to a Michael Connelly/Harry Bosch book. In fact, what's distinguished the series in the past is Connolly's ability to reinvent the genre, providing both tight, well-oiled plots and wickedly clever (and surprising) plot twists. But there are no real twists here that the smart, attentive reader couldn't see coming a mile or two away. And when did Bosch go from being a deeply flawed cynic to this sanctimonious bore who blathers on about ""speaking"" for the ""chorus of forgotten voices?"" He's always been a deeply dedicated (read obsessive) cop, but he's certainly no saint. Am I the only one who thinks Bosch has gone soft since becoming a daddy?"
2,Closers/Michael Conley,I was really looking forward to this book because it was the Harry Bosh character. For me the book never really took off. I found reading it a chore rather than a pleasure.
4,"Step aside Brenda Leigh Johnson, Harry Bosch wrote the book on this one!","How do you capitalize on your previous job experience? You write about it!Michael Connelly books have mesmerized readers with his working knowledgeof the California Law Enforcement community. Not even some of his main charactersare saved from the evil that lurks there. My thoguht is: If once you delve into his world of characters, and you don't find yourself fully engaged, you might want to check your sanity."
4,Great place to get books,"The book i orderes was listed as in good condition but when I recived my book it was in great condition no tears, bent pages nothing the book was like new. I also recived my book in only a few days which is always good. I will defintly go to this seller for more books."
4,First time reader of Connelly and not disappointed,This was my first Connelly book and I was not disappointed. I will go back to the beginning and start with the first Bosch novel. I love the character and story line.
3,Not one of his best,"I have read most of Mr. Connelly's books and liked most of them a lot. This one is so, so but still a good read."
2,Middle age doldrums?,"Maybe Harry is just mellowing in middle age, but I really didn't care much for this at all. I have liked the previous Bosch novels quite a bit and was anxious to read this. But it is a standard police procedural without the soul that marked the earlier novels. He spends way too much time apologizing for upsetting people, especially his partner. Harry is turning into a very dull guy."
3,Looking for the Real Harry,"Although I enjoy reading the Harry Bosch novels, this was not one of my favorites. Harry is an older policeman just coming back from retirement. Harry was better when he was working live cases. The first part of this book was so-so with a lot of background on the cold case Harry and Kiz were assigned and was quite boring. It picked up about half the way through the book, but still was not up to the standards of the author's previous works. We come to expect more from certain authors."
4,another great one,the books just keep getting better....I recently found michael connelly and can't get enough..... love the stories and so easy to read.....also believable....
5,Michael Connelly at his best,"Michael Connelly is one of my favorite detective writers, He always makes the Characters seem real and yet we always have s hero worship and are rooting for them all the way through. Can't say enough about his books but I do have to say have not read one I haven't liked."
4,The Closers,"In typical Harry Bosch style, ""The Closers"" was an entertaining read from cover to cover. His return to the police department was a nice touch and added dimension to the story that wasn't there when he was on his own working as a PI."
5,"Back in harness, Harry Bosch","It's like a high school reunion - you tend to forget how endearing these people have been , until you spend time with them again. Harry Bosch is, in my mind's eye, what law enforcement aspires to be. Thanks for another visit with an old acquaintance."
3,A weak return,"Although I was glad to welcome back Harry Bosch, I was a bit disappointed in this novel. I am a Connelly fan but felt that Mr. Connelly did not fully develop the characters in this story. It almost seems like this book was written a bit too quickly and not fully thought out. I will continue to read more of Connelly's work since I do love his writing but I don't think this was one of his best."
2,A Slow Boat to nowhere,"I enjoyed the humor in this book, but the mundane details that go on and on are too much. I have read half the book, and it is on my nightstand to finish when I don't have anything else to read. Connelly puts a lot of dry wit, in his writing style, but I do wish he would get on with the plot and pick up the pace!"
2,"Sorry, but.........","Sorry, but I have to disagree with the starred reviews. Mr. Connelly's plot and characters are very interesting, but has anyone actually read his dialogue out loud? People simply do not talk this way--and real people use contractions!! I became so annoyed with the stilted conversations that I simply could not finish the book, and I was 2/3 of the way through it. Not nearly up to the standards of his earlier works."
3,Pretty good but too much detail,"While the story was decent, it was a little slow to start. But, my main complaint is the detail the author goes into about anything and everything. He goes into details about the oddest things that have just nothing to do with the story. Several times I caught myself thinking to the author ""Geez, focus.""I'm not sure I'd read another Connelly. I found the obsession with details that didn't matter just too annoying."
1,dies a slow death,"What a disappointment! Starts off at an interesting pace, but quickly bogs down in the search for the almighty dollar. Laziness takes over and the writing begins to really stink. Repeats words, boring images, and the plot gets much too involved. I am, for one, not going to repeat the mistake of trying a ""Bosch"" novel again."
2,Bad audio CD,"Most of the reviews as far as I can tell are for the actual paper version of the book, but I just wanted to comment on the audio verson. It's bad as you can tell from the title of my review. The reader is slow and makes the story drag on and drag. Despite that, I managed to get through 15 hours of agony because I spent so much buying this audio CD. Again, the story moves very slow in the audio CD version."
1,is the writer on a word-count or what?,"I have enjoyed most of this author's books, especially Lincoln Lawyer...but this one is poorly written. The author explains almost every sentence he writes with three more sentences as though the reader could not possibly ""get it"" unless he does. It is driving me crazy. Also, he injects far too many personal moments into the cop's daily work that make no sense and add nothing to story-a toy reminds him of his daughter...big deal!Also explains the LA riots and racial issues as if no one else has ever heard of such a thing-instead of just moving the story ahead.I am losing interest fast but have nothing else to read in the house-i am really disappointed with this book..."
2,Very Disappointing,"THE CLOSERS is the most predictable Harry Bosch novel to date. Most readers will probably figure out who the villain is within the first hundred pages. After that, they'll be stuck slogging through another 300-plus pages in this half-baked mystery. A few novels ago, both Harry Bosch and author Michael Connelly were at the top of their games. In THE CLOSERS though, Bosch seems senile and Connelly seems to have lost his edge. However, do not abandon all hope ye who enter here. Even though THE CLOSERS was a major disappointment, I'm confident that Connelly can get back on track with his next Bosch novel. In the next one, hopefully he'll jettison Kiz Rider from the storyline. She is, was, and will always be ballast in these tales. Any author who can produce A DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT, THE POET, CITY OF BONES, and THE NARROWS can do much better than this."
4,Gripping nonetheless . . .,"Many reviewers make valid points, but I read it late into the night. The passing reference to Cassie Black perked my interest; she was the protagonist in Void Moon.Assume the loose ends will be picked up later."
1,Most worthless programming book I've ever used.,"I have a Master's degree in Computer Science with 3 years of programming experience in C++. This book is by far the most useless and horribly written programming book I've ever read. There are 600 pages in this book that tell you absolutely nothing other than how to map very basic C++ operations to C#.It mentions classes in some chapters that aren't defined until later chapters. When it does mention specific classes, it rarely lists all of their methods in a convenient and easy to read format. Instead, you have to look at the example code and hope there is some type of matching method that may be useful.It is also missing very important and useful classes such as the DateTime class.If you strictly want a book that maps basic C++ operations to C#, then this may be for you. Otherwise it is useless as a reference and not very well structured."
3,Good light reading,"This is an excellent example of fun, light reading that doesn't take itself or its genre too seriously. In this amusing book, a warrior and her daughter from another space/time place have taken up residence in Austin, TX so that the girl can get a solid education. The mother has a nice math teacher boyfriend. The two of them take on villains from the other dimension, people from a science fiction writer convention, romance novel characters, and (shudder, whimper) school bureaucrats. I gather from the reviews that some folks don't care much for this book, but I found it charming. I recommend it for a vacation book; a day of light reading; a pick-me-up when depressed."
2,Very 2D,"I found these books to be OK, apart from the horrible characterization. Everyone was so blandly drawn... Good guys were Good, badguys were very Bad. The idea of a villain being primarily a censor was a good idea but the author didn't have to throw in incest, felony, cruelty and evil into his figure; that way he becomes just another cardboard villain. Most censors are decent but slightly narrow-minded citizens who see a legitimate danger but go the wrong way or too far in trying to curb it. This way the censorship idea gets lost in a pile of other bad qualities.The books also weren't as light-hearted as the short stories... if there's more with these characters I hope their better done."
4,What's with the math?,"Sure a Laplace transform should move people around, but it is not the inverse of a Furry-R transform (that should turn people into furry animals)."
2,Not for Beginners,Beginners won't really benefit from this book. The author's vague description of perspective confuses rather than explains. The book resembles a sketchbook with some notes dropped into it. I would recommend The Art of Drawing and Pencil Drawing Techniques over this thing anyday.
2,"As a beginner, I'd buy a different book!","I bought this book hoping it would help me sketch simple objects. I was unpleasently surprised when I discovered it had very few exercises for the beginner. This book seems to be geared for the person that has a few art classes under their belt, and would like to improve their artwork. This book seems too advanced for the beginner who has trouble drawing simple items, like myself. It has very few pointers, and techniques. It does not break down the sketches to show how to achieve them, it is simply a book of finished sketches, with minimal teaching (such as the vanishing point)."
3,Beautiful sketches I still wish I could master,"This book is a pleasantly composed item with very beautiful sketches. The author gives very good information and examples on materials and techniques used, and it is clear that this book helped me, but only a little....I loved the fact that it was not overpowered with text and I would probably be able to copy the sketches in the book fairly well. Unfortunately I don't think this book helped me produce my own sketches from my personal observations. I thnk it is too advanced for the first-time drawer, or the drawer with a minimum of skill and even less confidence..."
4,The Complete Sketching Book,I found This book very helpful. I needed some help with shading and found the help I needed
1,ABSOLUTELY UNINSPIRING AND DULL,"The sketches given as examples are of very poor quality, the selection of themes is random and unorganized, nothing is explained to the fullest, instruction is vague, + there is no tips on composition.In short: another of these books that go step 1), step 2) and poof the drawing is finished without the instructor spelling out steps 3,4,5,6.The selection of drawing subjects is extremely restrictive or the author just lacked inspiration; it's just draw a little of this, than a little of that, with no finishing techniques and no idea on how to group the objects.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEYThere are plenty of better books, such as from Ernest Watson, Ferdinand Petrie, Wendon Blake and more (even if those guys are oldies; they remain goodies)"
5,Relevant and powerful,This book takes you places you have always feared and sets you free. It is never too late to explore and expand your world of relationships as this book empowers us to think and act with new insights. The meditations are expecially enlightening and can be used time and time again. Waiting for the next book .
3,an early work good for comparison with later ones,"This is a compilation of probably the earliest film clips made by the Rieu and Strauss orchestra, so it shows their young faces. the more recent DVD's are much more polished affairs. it's good to see how performers improve over time, still worth the purchase but for the reason of showing the changes as time goes by"
5,ANDRE RIEU DOES IT AGAIN!!,Time after time---he never misses an opportunity to make the best music possible. We wish we had all his DVDs!!
4,Pretty Scottish Orchestral Music,"I was pleased with myself when I heard this recording and thought highly of it, only to see the English magazine, 'Grammaphone' highlight it as a featured album of the month when it came out about 12 years ago. Needless to say, this William Wallace is NOT the same Wallace featured in the movie 'Braveheart', but a Scottish composer of 400 years later. All the works are very pretty, and prettily performed, with the expected influence from Wagner, and none from any more modern composer. Amazon's list price is a bit steep, as it originally listed for around $17, typical of a Hyperion release.Great if you are fond of early 20th century UK music."
4,Very Practical Working Tool,"This book gets to the nitty-gritty with a well laid out process to follow and brief, yet meaningful, examples of what to do and why. Great for all levels of employees to read and it only takes about 1 hour to get through."
3,"Just about touches the ""5 S's""....Not detailed enough","I wonder if workers on a shop floor would actually like to sit down and read this book. This touches the 5S's (Organization, Orderliness, Cleanliness, Organized cleanup, and Discipline), but does not give a detailed description of how one is to implement this tool. I recommend another book ""5 Pillars of the Visual Workplace"", to have a more detailed description of the 5S's.Effective implementation of this tool requires very high participation from senior management to make important decisions. I think workers will not be in a position to implement this tool, and so this book is not very useful."
4,It is simple enough to execute,"5S for the operators is a book that you can give to your Operations team where they can read and implement fast. It is written in a plain language where anyone can understand. Overall, I would recommend this book."
2,Short and Sweet,"Judging by the long reviews before me, it should be obvious that there is much to say about Calvin's theology. This book doesn't say too much. For those familiar with his theology, DON'T buy this book. It will be a waste of your money. For those who would like to know more about Calvin's theology, without getting caught in mid 16th century language or too deep into theology, buy this. If you want a good in depth coverage of Calvin's theology, buy the FULL version and enjoy."
2,Disappointing,"I strongly support a good translation of Calvin's magnum opus work. However, this translation is heavily abridged, and is a disappointment in how little actually remains.Additionally, the modern translation of the Holy Scriptures, based on the critical text, is also a disappointment.I was disappointed by this collection."
3,Very good music...but very bad image and stereotype!,"Beeing a sicilian and an ethnomusicologist I can say that the music recorded on this cd is of a QUALITATIVE LEVEL and REPERTORY which ARE EXCEPTIONAL,I decisevly though don't like the terrible stereotype of the image of Sicily only connected with the criminal world,there is a lot of more interesting and beautifull things to focus on in this land than the mafia.For example what about the mafia in China,Japan,Russia,Albania,or even...the USA!I really don't agree with the TITLE of this cd,the connection of these wonderfull sounds with such a terrible criminal stereotype is highly harming,in fact,the sicilian culture as well...Lisen to the music...and please forget that Sicily is ONLY mafia,it'not true...and it's not any badder than many other""civilised""places in the world."
5,Tan bueno como el primero,"Estupenda segunda parte de la serie de recopilaciones de la ""musica della malavita"". Música densa, intensa y paradójica."
5,Brilliant,"Part of the success of the Hyperion label can be ascribed to the fact that time and again their performers come up with composers so arcane that one feels compelled to buy the disc just to see what it's like. Should you have exactly the opposite problem, of not wanting to buy music of a composer nobody's heard of, let me put you in the picture: York Bowen (1884-1964) was an English pianist and composer, who graduated from the London Royal Academy in 1905, and was of a talent equal to Nikolai Medtner, the Russian virtuoso of the same period. His piano music is similar to that of Medtner and, to a lesser extent, Rachmaninov, but with a very slight modern element. In any case, the music here is beautiful, romantic - and difficult, but that presents no problems to Stephen Hough. If you like 19th century romantic, virtuoso piano music, à la Liszt, Rachmaninov, Medtner etc. then you won't go wrong buying this disc."
5,Great Reading!,"This book is so well written, I felt like I was on the WidowMaker with Aubrey. I recommend this book to anyone that likes a good romance, mystery or adventure book."
2,picutres are deciving,ive gotten better out of a gumball machine the necklace fit around my neck with like an inch to spare its tiny not masculine at all worst buy off amazon but shipping was nice thats about it
5,The Lady of the Greek Rebetika Songs,"The best Greek record I have ever heard (I have listened to Greek music since 1968). The voice is harsh and lively, just like the sorrows expressed in each song. The bouzouki is perfect. I knew Mrs Bellou in 1981. She died of throat cancer in 1997 and is still considered by many as the best representative of Greek urban folk music. Enjoy it, please!"
1,cat scratching post,"It isn't me that doesn't like it, ""IT'S THE CAT""Kramer has had a scratching post similar to this since he was a kitten he is now 7 years old, they have always been the blue low mesh carpet type.He constantly scratches them, lays next to it and hangs on it. Never bothers the furniture or our rugs thanks to his satisfaction. We've always had one in every room for his enjoyment.Kmart was always our supplier, but they stopped carrying them and we just can't find the exact type any longer. The new thick beige carpet doesn't appeal to him at all!!! Seems to be well made and all, just no Cat appeal."
1,Not worth the money.,"I have 4 cats, none are overweight (largest is 7 lbs) but no matter which one uses this it falls over. Very lightweight carpet covering (top piece was held on by two staples) and extremely lightweight plastic cone.Six months later (I enticed them initially with catnip) it goes completely unused and will be out in the trash this week.If you have low pile or looped carpet - pass this one up. The cats don't particularly care for this scratching post but they apparently think the carpet is now fair game. I should have and from now on will stick with the sisal only posts."
5,The blessings of brokeness: Why God allows us to go through Hard Times,This is a wonderful book for those who are going through hard times in their lives. Wonderfully written.
5,Wonderful lessons,Dr. Stanley continues to help me grow as a Christian as he teaches valuable life lessons. I love his practical hearfelt approach to teaching and feel that I continue to grow closer to God through solid teaching from Dr. Stanley and others.
5,This book shows you just how much love God has for us,"Charles Stanley has to be one of the greatest people that God has chosen to speak through. This book touched my heart and showed me why things happen to me and the reason they happen. It shows me that even though bad things happen, it does not mean that God is being mean to me. It means that God is reshaping my life so that I can be more of a witness to Him and allow Him to fullfil his will through me. I would tell anyone who is going through tough times to read this book and your life will start to look brighter each word you read."
2,NOT A GOOD CHOICE,I found this book to be not only boring but the charcters were unlovable. If you like Dara Joy's books move past this one and consider Stardust Dreams by Marilyn Campbell.
3,Not one of her better efforts,It was a struggle to finish the book because it has quite a few sub-plots within the main one and somehow I felt that the main hero and heroine of the book were finished off rather abruptly.
3,Greenfire,I thought it was a very interesting book. I didn't want to put it down. It was interesting to try and figure out how Nazleen and Zaktar were going to work out their differences. I actually felt sad when Miklav got killed.
3,"Great activities, a little dated print","This has great ideas, scripture reference and loads of ideas for parents to lead activities with young children.The book seems a bit dated but it's filled with a wealth of ideas. Maybe a modern version of this book needs to be published with pictures of actual products or in color.All in all, it's a fair book."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"I bought this card two weeks ago, and have given up on it. I'm returning it!For 3D games (Quake I, II & II, Unreal T, Tomb Raider etc.) it works great (for 16 bit). However if you try to do Video-Capture, it is horrible!My previous cards (ATI XPERT98 + TV Tuner **ISA!**) performed better. It might say 30 fps, but it looks all choppy and grainy. I have a ATHLON 700 system but still, real-time videocapture is horrible. The lousy video-capture is not worth the extra $50. My suggestion is to Get a GeForce......"
2,It's fast but....,"I have this card and a GeForce 256 (Creative And Gullimot both have cards) based card, and head to head the GeForce kills this card. Image Quality vs Speed, The GeForce 256 chipset runs away with the ""perfect"" blend between beauty and Frames per Second. Most GeForce cards are around 250-300 dollars, and they support 32bit color, T&L support, OpenGL and D3D (forget Glide, according to most software devolpers this is on way out, because only one chipset supports it), and as far as overclock ability, you dont need to this card has a 256 bit processor, not a 128 like the voodoo cards. This is simply my opion take it as such, I own both cards on two exact machines, and i dont think the Voodoo 3 is worth the money for hard core gamers."
4,Video Capture,"Well i purchased this card for video capture not for gameing and after four months of tweaking i finnally got it working correctly.I have to say it commands my whole system,other add ons dont like this card (webcams and other usb toys)The software that came with it for video capture is nice but not so user friendly and it doesnt compress like people might think for avi formating.The quality of the video is excelent.I also had to download new drivers (after only four months)Overall its a good card for the money.Remember you get what you pay for in video capture cards. And in this price range this is as good as it gets.Oh one more thing the captureing devices are not reconized by microsofts netmeeting so you are unable to hold netmeetings useing your camcorder with this card.Thats a real dissapiontment for me."
3,Voodoo3 Review,"The reason I only gave this card a 3 out of 5 stars, is that it seems to lack the power that is needed in todays games. It really is a great card though, extremly well made! Its a 3DFX, and I think they make exceptional products. For games as half life and such, it does a BEAUTIFUL job, but for Q3, it doesn't quite have the buffering power. It also doesn't have 32 bit color. I wouldn't say a GeForce is any better either, I don't think they are that well made. I'd wait another month or so for 3DFX's Voodoo4 and 5."
2,"Good, while it lasted...","I was initially quite impressed with this card - though the unique voodoo to vga cable adaptor was a bit odd. The card performed well, and actually still is. However, the special cable that came with the card (the only one that will allow your monitor to view the signal) is having problems now. If this was any other card I could easily buy a new VGA cable. Voodoo shortsightedness in the making of this product puts me in an awkward position - buy a new card so that I'm not tied to a propriatary setup or search eBay for an extra cable. All in all, not worth the ticket pricel"
3,Good card for the price,DO NOT buy this card for the TV-OUT or anything out function; it doesn't work! Besides that it has cool on screen remotes and great graphivs acceleration. DVD playback is ok. It can cause problems with system so only put this card in a system with a minimum of a P3 500-600 and at least 64MB RAM.
1,Geforce vs. Voodoo3,I have tried both the Voodoo3 and the Geforce out on Unreal Tournament and Quake 3 and the Geforce 256 outperforms the voodoo3 in every aspect. There is no way anyone could get me to buy this product again when i have a geforce sitting in my pc!
1,Not AGP,"I purchased this thinking the video was AGP, It may plug into a AGP slot but it uses PCI Video. It drasticly slowed down My system, After a few hours I pulled it out of My system. Reinstalled My AGP Video card and Voodoo2 card. I am going to give this card away, Could not bring Myself to charge someone for it.:("
5,Fast delivery in excellent condition. Thanks,This is a well written account of Lyndon Johnson as president. It continues where MASTER OF THE SENATE by Robert Caro ends. The set of three books on Lyndon Johnson by Caro followed by FLAWED GIANT provide a fundamental insight into how the US has evolved in today's world. Lyndon Johnson had a watershed effect on the way we think and function today. Problems similar to those that Johnson addressed are being experienced today and these books illuminate the difficulties politicians have in solving them. Dallek does an excellent job looking into Johnson's thinking processes.
3,Not as good as volume one,"I admire Dalleck and think he's an able historian, but volume two is leagues inferior to volume one, ""Lone Star Rising."" Dalleck glosses over LBJ's Vice Presidential years in twenty pages and reveals little new material from the early 1960's. His treatment of the JFJ-LBJ political and personal relationship also is lacking.Robert Caro is writing the definitive treatment of LBJ and Caro is a more accomplished writer, but Dalleck at least cuts Johnson a break and sees the good in this flawed giant. Dalleck is particularly good at illuminating the Great Society and Johnson's sweeping social programs. His military treatment of Vietnam is hardly penetrating.This is an adequate book on Johnson as President, but not as gripping as the initial volume."
3,Technically superb but...,I slipped in this DVD last night and watched it in it beginning to end. There were several moments I was amazed on Steve's wizardry. He is an accomplished guitarist. The band is precise. But so much of this sounds the same one song to the next.
5,Bonanza Has Never Been Better,"I've held off buying any Bonanza episodes for years, waiting until they got it right--picture, sound, music, and other aspects pertaining to remastering. As far as I can tell, this is what we've all been waiting for. And yes, the scoring is the original music. Although the packaging does seem substantial, I do wish it was not designed so that a disc often has to be removed in order to read some episode descriptions. However, we rarely get everything we want, and the all important content is superb! I can hardly wait for the offering of season 2!"
4,Bonanza rides again,"I used to watch Bonanza when it was on TV. Brings back memories of the good old days when life seemed less complex.It was great to see that Amazon had it on instant play. You guys rock!The story starts off in the typical peaceful setting of the Ponderosa ranch and then quickly gets you engaged in some brotherly fighting. From there the action develops fairly quick. Little Joe is seduced by the pretty ""spider"" and falls into the bad guys trap, he's so gullible. What more could a fan of westerns ask? It's got action, adventure, romance, and the scenery is awesome! So just watch it and enjoy."
2,They've removed the original Bonanza theme song!,"Very disappointed that the original Bonanza theme song and track have been removed and replaced with generic material. I have seen this done by Sony and Paramount for shows like Andy Griffith and My Three sons, the latter replaced with Motown music. They do this because they're too cheap to pay the royalties for the original music.I can see how the Japanese at Sony don't get it, but for American companies to remove the iconic themes from these TV shows is a crime. The original themes are an integral part of the nostalgic experience for these old time shows. Very disappointed!"
3,Pretty Good,"The set seems pretty good. I see only 3 cons...1) The chapter fades are too early. What I mean is, at the end of each chapter, the video fades to black a few seconds before the audio. It's a little annoying.2) There is a slight flickering most noticable on bright scenes.3) The audio is sometimes out-of-sync with the video. You can see this during dialog close-ups.Anyone else notice these? Hopefully they will correct this with future releases."
2,Seasons 1 through 7 are available on German Amazon!,Why wait all this time when you can have seasons 1 through 7 from German Amazon! I certainly didn't!
5,Awesome!,I am so glad Bonanza is on DVD! I was just introduced to Bonanza and I love it! The quality of this DVD set is wonderful. I can't wait for the other seasons to come out too!
5,"Bonanza, First Season, two volumes",I am in love with Bonanza all over again!! The episodes are perfect and the extras are absolutely wonderful. So many pictures I have never seen before and the interviews with David Dortort are priceless. I have waited so long for these dvds and now they are here!! Just good to know it was worth every second of the wait; they are fabulous and I am already anxious for the next season.
4,Best Western (not the Hotel),"Anyone who loves this Western will enjoy this tape. I am happy it is available, however this was a little pricey."
5,BEAUTIFUL!,I'm in love with the creator of Vampire Princess Miyu's artwork! It's amazing what she can do with a brush and water colour. The feelings of the characters especially of Miyu's affection toward Larva is apparent in this artbook. This artbook contains manga and anime from the series. <3
3,bootglove,"ordered a pair of mediums which didn't fit due to strrap that ran across the bottom of the foot of the boot was not long enough to help the glove to cover the boot property. returned them and ordered larges. larges are too large and will have to be modified ( cutting and the like) to work. As far as protection from cold, they seem to work in the beginning of my skiing but as time passes my feet still get cold in about the same amount of time as before."
4,A help for cold feet.,I think they help a little. Fit perfect and not difficult to put on. I use these in combination with toe warmers.
2,Does not keep feet warm,My husband has tried them for a few weekends now and they do not work for keeping feet warm. Maybe in conjunction with battery warmers but not on their own.
5,toasty feets,"these thing actually work! they kept my feet warmer and after skiing, I didn't have snow all jammed in the boot fasteners"
4,Ski Boot Warmer,"Excellent product but the manufacturer's guide to size could be improved. I chose the medium for a seven and a half UK shoe size, ski boot 309mm, and it only just fastens. I really needed the large size."
5,"Finally, my feet are warm!","This is a wonderful product. For years, I've suffered from cold feet while skiing. No more!!! It's unbelievable how well this poduct works! I've been using it for years!!"
3,DriGuy boot gloves,These boot gloves keep your feet warmer in cold weather...a nice edition in cold weather. I use them whenever I hit a cold day on the slopes and find my toes stay warmer longer.
3,Fits but not fits,"These bootgloves will work for my downhill boots and that will be good for next season. However the understrap crosses the front plate of my back-country ski binding, so I am not sure if that is such a good thing. So I probably won't use them for the original intent of keeping my toes warm when touring in really cold temps. Maybe I could take them off the boots when I ski back downhill?"
4,Works as Advertised,"These really do work as advertised, although, like anything, they don't last forever. In fact, the purchase I'm reviewing was a replacement for my original set which were several years old. The only thing negative that I can say is that they can be a bit difficult to install each day because you install them after your boots are on and buckled...a friend to assist you can be helpful!"
2,"Nice idea and quality, but interferes with binding.","I like the idea, and the covers are very well made. I just can't get the covers on my boots in a way that doesn't interfere with the ski binding in the toe area. I could probably trim the front of the cover to get it away from the binding, but decided to return the covers instead."
4,boot gloves,They really help keep my daughter's feet warm. She can stay out longer before her toes get cold. They are very easy to put on and take off. My daughter is 7 she can put them on by herself.
2,Fell apart after 2 ski days,"The pair of BootGloves I purchased disintegrated after only 2 days of skiing. They tear easily. Also, the toes of the BootGloves folded back in ankle-deep snow, thus became permanently stretched and useless."
5,Works as advertised.,I have a space blanket I wanted to add a few grommets to so I could tie it over my aircraft engine in the winter. This kit works exactly as it should. The gormmets are very solidly attached and the end result is very satisfactory and functional. I recommend it without reservations.
1,Not as advertised,The product description for this item is the wrong size! This one is 1/2 inch. Customer service with Amazon was not helpful in replacing this product with the correct item.
2,Good item but I thought it would be shipped faster,"I ordered this product in order to get it ASAP which I was lead to believed would happen. I ordered it on June 16th, The package was shipped on June 25th 9 days after I had ordered it. That was a disappointment, but the item seems to be as described"
2,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"This package only contains 12 grommets, yes there are 24 pieces, but that only equals 12 grommets. Amazon describes it as 24 grommets. Also, my package was missing two grommet halves, so I could only use 10 of them."
4,Better Quality Than Expected,The Lord & Hodge Grommet Kit is of better quality than I expected. I bought it primarily for setting new holes in camping tarps and nylon straps which it does nicely. It's very easy to use and I found myself finding new uses for grommet holes -- hanging hand towels outside has been the most useful. A good product for household and camping.
5,Perfect,Used to hold down boat cover on all 4 ends with bungee cords as snaps would come loose while driving. Worked perfectly!!
2,Way to small,"Waste of money for me. Barely holds 1 ID, 2 CC and a few business cards. Would not even close by itself with those items inside. bummed"
3,Way too lean,This wallet would be great if all I had was a creit card or two. It simply doesn't hold very much at all-I was disappointed.
5,ell skin wallet,Awesome wallet! This has been my third ell skin wallet i have bought for a gift and they all love it.
5,Eelskin wallet,"Can't beat eelskin for toughness, good looks, and class. This wallet is no exception."
2,Poor fit,"I bought the wallet off of the strong reviews it enjoys here on Amazon, but wasn't happy with the product once it arrived. All of the pockets are a tad too small making it difficult to get anything into their slots, and impossible to carry business cards without them being bent. It also doesn't close all the way when loaded up which is a big deal to me. If I force the wallet closed it's visibly bending cards in it. I don't think I carry around any abnormal amount of cards: 3 forms of ID, an insurance card, 4 credit/debit cards and 3 rewards cards. It's not even close to be able to handle that."
3,"Nice looking, but too small.",Got this a while back for a birthday gift for my husband. He used it recently and said that it is too small. Doesn't fit all of the stuff his old wallet fit that was suppose to be the same size.
4,"Nice, but too small.",It's amazing what a difference a quarter of an inch makes.I've been trying to replace my old eel skin wallet and it's proving to be quite difficult. This is a lovely wallet but it's petite.
4,It had some minor knicks and dings,I got this because one of my friends got one but when I got mine it had alot of Knicks and dings in it but besides that it is a very good product and I recommend it
4,better than leather,Nice wallet for a good price. I love eel skin because it doesn't smell like leather does after a couple of months. Some people like that smell but I personally dont like a sour smelling wallet in my pocket all day.
5,"Superb, must see movie foe everyone, even for anti-Reagans!","Ronald Reagan did save our lives and the sole fact that we work, leave and sleep peacefuly, is the result of his vision and the style of leadership. He brought our dreams to life by his arrogance and strong belief in future and democracy. This video will tell and remind us again that He did act and while acting he never gave up thinking about the people around the world. Let us wish Gipper all the best for the remainder of his glorious life!"
2,OK but not the best of the Great Communicator,"This is fine but not the final word. I would highly recommend spending a few more dollar and picking up MPI's ""Ronald Reagan--the Great Communicator"" which has seven hours of highlights."
4,Good,"I liked this book, and I also liked the facts where Claudia stopped believing and stuff. What I'm unhappy about is that people think that if you believe then you are immature. I am twelve, and I STILL BELIEVE! Why is it that it is stupid to believe in magical things that make the world a happier place, but people have killed eachother over religion. I read sweet valley high aswell, and people say that I'm mature for my age, but I'm not even going to deny that I still believe in Santa! I think that you measure maturity on how they react in different situations, not if they have faith in make believe. but back to the book, I think it is a good, honest book about Claudia. But I just wanted to tell people that why not be a kid for as long as possible. I think its fake that people are trying to be older then they are, and thats what I found a bit sad about this book."
3,okay book,"the only stories I really enjoyed the most were the ones about claudia's surprise party and switching schools in 4th grade. I could relate to her fears of going to the dentist because I used to have that fear back in my 7-year-old days too, but the tooth fairy stuff was a bit too much. And a little contradictory coming from ann m martin, considering that karen brewer in the little sister series truly believes in santa, the tooth fairy, santa's reindeer, etc. All in all, a nice book though. I wish it talked a bit more about her artwork though, she seems to be a very creative person, but the book didn't reflect that much, it just mentioned an art project in grade 2 and 4."
4,The Witness,"I like this movie. Read something about the story. A crooked developer fails to convince the owner of a wax museum to sell, and so hires an evil arsonist, Gregor. It's a fast and furious fight for their lives when a young boy and his unlikely friend discover the arsonist's plot to burn the historic museum to the ground. There's danger at every turn and fear with every breath!"
1,Not a user friendly appliance lift,This is the third appliance lift I have installed and the first by this manufacturer. After following the instructions the first time I had to remount it to get it level as the left and right sides didn't line up. After I got it installed and leveled I was disappointed to discover that it was difficult to operate. If I ever need to purchase another one it will not be this brand.
3,Air it out and it's loads of fun!,We left the game on our screen porch for about 5 or 6 weeks and then the smell was gone. I used it at a Geography Summer Camp and the kids loved it. Now my kids play it at home - they prefer it over Twister.
2,Good screen but whistles,"I'm pleased with the quality of the image but almost everyday my monitor emits a high pitched whine that drives me crazy.I have to hit the side of the monitor hard to make it stop.we have 2 of these in our house, they both do it"
4,"Performs well, but setup was tricky","I can't speak for the speed of the drive because I don't use it often. I bought it to use for backup space. I set it up with two 9.7 gig extended DOS partitions and backup a desktop and a laptop very easily and with a saving of about $700 over a tape backup system. Listen, guys. Tape backup will never keep up with drive size.Setup was difficult (even for me, who has been in computers since the TRS-80), but WD tech support is great."
3,Could Have Been Better,"The director begins the proceedings with a bang and when he takes you to the point of thrill, reverses his car to get into flashback. And by the time he gets back to first gear to the point of the thrill, all excitement is lost. You almost forget which spot it was that he had reversed his vehicle. Has he lost his touch? Looks like, because even the court proceedings are so hurried that it looks like he had lost interest in the project. All the accused rush up to the `box' and before they can say anything are charged ""Guilty"". The end is abrupt!"
1,Not recommended,"This is acoustic versions of Dragon songs sung by someone other than Marc Hunter. Nice if you're a fan, I guess, but I was looking for a ""best of"" and this wasn't it. Songs from the Hard Times is the one to get."
1,"Poor quality, poor customer relations","After 2 months the hooting on the owl stopped working. The head still turns, but the owl doesn't hoot. I've changed the batteries several times with new batteries. I also wrote to the seller telling them the problem and asking for a replacement but have received no response after 3 weeks. I don't recommend this product."
3,Seems to do what it is supposed to.,"The motion sensors seem to be a little flaky. When I first turned it on and was handling it to put it in location, it ""hooted"" at me constantly. Since then I have only heard it once. It is setting on the ground, so the sensors are lower to the ground than most of the birds that were landing on a nearby rock though. When I walk up to it and handle the owl it will still not activate unless I shut it off and turn it back on. However, I purchased it to keep birds from landing on an ornamental rock and they have stopped. Apparently the owl's presence is enough to keep them away. I could have saved a few dollars and got a model that didn't move and seemingly had the same results. Overall I am not unhappy with this owl, just a little dissappointed (although not entirely surprised) about the lack of functioning sensors."
3,Garden Guard,"This owl works great as long as it is moving. If the birds aren't detected, they will sit on the ground right under the owl. The detectors are either too few or they're not sensitive enough. A human body will trigger it quickly, but birds are a different story. It takes a whole flock of birds to make it move and that's just not good enough. It could definitely stand some improvements."
5,Keeping Birds Away,"Our cars in the driveway were not safe from the birds, but they are now. It is a great product. Linda"
2,Bird deterrent,This is the second type of owl we have bought to cover our pool. Birds have been using pool and leaving behind their waste and feathers. We received it yesterday and it appears sensors are not working properly. Owl randomly reacts to movement and not as it is purported to do. We may be sending it back if it does not do what we ordered it to do.
2,Hoot Hoot,We'll if your into owls it's ok for looks. But I really think it does not make a difference for pesty black birds who were constantly crapping on my pool cover. The batteries do not hold up long enough have to keep replacing the batteries if you want it to Hoot. It was a expensive novilty is all I make out of it.
1,Easy Gardener 8021 Defense Sensor Owl,"Owl came in with two sections (the head and the body). Investigating the box I also found a third piece (broken gear from the head). No way to get the owl to move its head from side to side. Contacted the manufacturer, but they were not interested in sending another head piece. Mounted the owl in top of RV shed to keep birds from roosting. Although the owl made ""hooting"" noise with his motionless head, the birds ignored the owl and built a nest about 5 feet from him. I would not recommend."
2,Skip this and go with the wind or solar owl..,"Save some cash and buy a stationary, wind powered or solar owl. The motion sensors in this unit are weak at best and when they do activate, the head very loudly and very mechanically clicks in the direction of the movement. The audible hoot can be silenced but if you leave it activated and have neighbors closer than 500 feet, you'll probably find the owl in pieces or missing one day. Factor in a very cheap build, a battery compartment that probably isn't water proof and the fact that you will have to continually buy batteries for it and I'd say move on and go with another model."
1,Terrible Product...,"The main problem with this owl is that the sensors do NOT work as intended. The birds just flew and walked up to it, AND THE THING NEVER MOVED OR HOOTED as advertised. Because it remained stationary, the birds were not even remotely frightened or repelled. They just went about their business of defecating and tearing up my yard. This product is awful, and the sensors need to be far more sensitive. I had to put my hand directly in front of them to make it work, which totally defeats the purpose of this product. This was a severe disappointment and I would advise you to think twice or FOUR times before considering this purchase."
1,Doesn't work,"I should have paid attention to the other reviews. It hoots, but the head doesn't swivel. The motor must have broken off from the head in transit. Buy something else."
2,Not worth it,"The first owl I received was broken. The return process went very smoothly and I had a new owl in no time. BUT, the sound quit after one week and now only occasionally does the head turn. It has been effective in keeping the birds away by just sitting there but I could have accomplished this with a much cheaper model."
1,Total Piece of Crap!,"Motion sensor is useless. Range of 6"" at the most. Wave my hand just a foot away and nothing. Under no circumstance purchase this item."
4,Realistic Look but Poor Sensor,"I bought this electronic owl to supplement the wind action rotating-head owl that I had purchased from Amazon. This owl also looks quite realistic, and it hoots and rotates its head when the sensor is triggered. I, however, think that the sensing distance is way too short; I have to be within two feet from the owl to trigger the sensor. Nevertheless, it seems to deter rabbits from entering my yard."
1,What a Hoot of a Product,I ordered two of the owls for the patio of our office building. One head fell off when I took it out of the box and the other one simply would not work.Don't waist your time and money.
1,didn't work out of the box,Flimsy construction. On/off switch failed out of the box. Decided to put it outside anyway ...either the wind blew it off it's perch or the squirrels assaulted it...bottom line it I found it in pieces on the deck. I would not recommend.
2,"Looks cool, broke instantly",I dropped it and its head fell off. Very fragile not well made. Funny at first when its working.
1,TOTAL CRAP,Total waste of money.After 1 week owl would no longer hoot.Motion sensor detects movement but head moves in opposite direction of what is moving.Use your money wisely and stay away from this piece of junk.
1,the owl hooted only once,"Sounds like a British suspense novel, does it not? A butler brings cigars to the gentlemen, opens window in the library, everybody hears the solitary hoot in the chill of the night, and later they find a dead body in the adjacent drawing room.Very well then. I received this owl and inserted the batteries. The owl came to life, hooted, noisily turned its head, and remains silent and motionless ever since.Not recommended unless you want to flirt with your post office clerk while returning the box back to Amazon."
1,Electronic Owl,Easy Gardener Garden Defense Electronic Owl #8021I use this owl on my deck to keep birds from dropping their waste. It needs to be weighted so it doesn't fall over when the wind blows. The nails supplied are not an option. for the deterrent effect to be useful the owl must be moved.
2,Not what I expected,"I have never seen a real owl with pink feathers. However, this owl has them. The motion sensors are not effective. Seldom do they work. Most of the time, the sensors do not detect near-by motion. I would not recommend this product simply because it does not function effectively."
3,Garden owl,"Although it looks imposing to a human, this particular owl has no effect on keeping squirrels or other pests out of our garden. Also, the batteries don't last long when it is on the sensor mode."
2,"The Owl Scares my Golden retriever, but not the birds","Definetelly not a good purchase. The only animal that is afraid from it is my loved Golden Retriever. On the first day regular birds were aware of this new thing, but on the second day they were staying at the Owl head. This product consumes a lot of battery. If the sound is activated with the motion, on three days batteries are run out. Quality is also not good, mine is already broken."
1,what a waste of money,"Thought this might be the answer to birds using the patio for a bathroom. Wrong... first problem was that the ""motion detector"" only worked when the motion was about six inches away from the sensors. Then the other major issue was the light weight coupled with a base that has an uneven balance due to three protruding points made it extremely unsteady. Should have known that with the first wind it was going over. It did, it broke and I am out almost $40 and the broken owl is now in a landfill. Don't buy it..."
2,Boo,This product did not keeps the birds away from my dogs food bowl. And it sometimes would not hoot or hoot continuously.
2,Interesting bird perch,"This device does respond to motion at times, apparently through four sensors arranged around the base. And the head does indeed tend to turn toward the source of detected motion. Unfortunately, the unit that we received does not respond reliably to the birds (mostly starlings and robins) that frequent our back yard.We installed the owl on a post at one corner of a small garden, about ten feet square, and then waited for results. After about half an hour, the birds became accustomed to the owl and paid no further attention to it, other than occasionally using it as s temporary perch before invading the garden.An interesting conversation piece, but (ours at least) did not provide much protection for our poor tomatoes."
2,Motion sensors need an upgrade,I bought the product to discourage squirrels and that was my mistake. The owl looks great and when activated works well. The problem is that the motion detectors require a good deal of motion in the right location to initiate action. The owl motion detectors simply aren't sensitive enough.
3,its okay but it lasted 1 week until it broked,"I had one week of no birds and mi patio.... but the owl falled down and broked its head.So, I thinking on giving it a second chance."
2,Just doesn't work for what I bought it for!,"First off, this Owl looks cool, but it just does not scare the doves away like it says it does. The motion activated feature is hit and miss and I am pretty sure the doves use it as a perch now. So now it is just a backyard prop. Bummer! The doves are driving us crazy!"
1,owl,the product came in and did not work...i sent it back for a full refundI had heard there was a lot of problems with this product but i decided to try it...Wrongg !
1,Do nothing Owl.,"If I could have given this a minus 5 I would have. It was a piece of junk. The reason why I said was, I put it in the garbage 1 month later. It worked for 1 day then nothing after it."
1,Easy Gardener 8021 Owl,"The product looked fine and did as described however, the birds totally ignored it. I placed it within 5 feet of the nesting area."
2,Garden defense -electronic owl,This owl never deterred the birds and the squirrels just totally ignored the owl. It never hooted. It did turn its head when it sensed a movement but this did little to deter the birds after the first day of putting the owl out.Very Disappointing
4,wow owl works,"easy garden owl keeps birds away from myshop, birds were tripping security alarmand bird dropping both problem is solvedfor now"
1,Disappointed Consumer,"The electronic owl that I purchased initially fulfilled the mission for which I purchased it--getting rid of the crows that frequented my yard. However, the owl lost its sound after one month's time. The sound device stopped working completely, and it is not nearly as effective in scaring away predators as it was when the sound was available. Since the owl has a sixty-day warranty, I am hoping the company will replace it."
2,heads won't turn on this owl,I liked the idea of the owl in the garden.I liked it more IF the head would turn.I bought one for my neighbor and myself and neither one of our owl's head turns at all. :-(
1,Defective Owl Sensor,"I am totally disgusted with Grady's Hardware which is the store this defective owl was sent from. The first owl did not work at all. I called Grady's for a credit but was told the only thing I could get was another owl, which they then sent. This second owl did not work until 4:30AM I was awoken by a noise which was the owl, hooting continuously until I got out of bed in the middle of the night, went out in the dark and shut it off. I turned it back on after that but it never worked again. If I had not purchased from Amazon before, because of this experience I would never buy from Amazon again. I am surprised that a company in good standing, as Amazon is. would continue to have this item advertisied when it does not work as stated and you cannot get a refund so you are stuck with it."
4,Excellent!,I just love my Hootie The Owl... this is a nice defense against the rabbits that feast at night.
1,Not worth the money,"Bought this hoping to keep critters out of the garden, what a joke. It worked the first time I put batteries in and once I got it outside it won't work. The old cheap one I got years ago is still working and the eyes lite up. So don't waste your money on this thing. Go get the cheaper model that just hoots and lites up the eyes or even one that does nothing. We are going to take it apart to see if we can fix it, but I'm really sorry I bought it."
2,Owl,"Not sure it worked properly from the beginning. Actually had a squirrel lean on it and it never responded to it being there. Very light weight and no way to anchor it to a railing or pole. Wind knocked it off a table, messed up the head and is no longer working. Don't think I've had it a month. Improvements definitely need to be made."
1,Absolute Garbage!!!,Do not waste your money on this Garbage! Hooted once and stopped working. What a cheaply made piece of trash!!
3,Owl,"I install this owl around my deck. At first it seemed to keep the birds away but after a few days, most of the birds were back. It seems to be effective with the white wing doves still which was most of my problems with them roosting over my deck. I think it may be slightly more effective if it is moved around to different areas. I motion detector does not work very good."
1,Mediocre - not working at all.,"When I received the owl, the box had no packing slip as to who the vendor was. The head was not attached to the owl. I had to attach the head. It worked for one week only. In that week, I replaced batteries twice. It does not work now. I would return it if I knew where and how."
1,Owl,This item stinks The pigeons and squirrels loved it and also did not operate right And operated whenever it wanted.....
1,Can't recommend,"The head does turn, the thing does hoot. That's all I can say that's positive. The batteries wear out after a week of use, and the dang bird is top heavy and topples over in the faintest breeze. Because the batteries wore out so quickly, I can't tell if the owl scared anything away or not."
1,Owl Sucks,"I bought the electronic owl and found that right out of the box, it did not work. I played around with it and got the head to turn, and turn and turn and turn. It never shuts off. I got the owl to make his owl noise my shaking it around a little, it hoots till the battery goes dead. Now I have a hooting head turning owl that runs 30 minutes till the battery quits. The sensors do not have not and will not work. This is a piece of junk and would never ever buy another. I am so mad at the owl, I may just rip his hooting head off. Do not buy."
1,Sorry to say,"I received 2 owl's. The first one didn't work after a few days. The company was very good about exchanging it with a new one. The second one also didn't work after a few days, but I lost my receipt and so I was unable to return it. I specifically wanted the hooting owl to scar away the critters in my yard. When it worked it did a good job and I would get another one, but I would like it to keep working a bit longer."
1,Really dissappointed,"This is our second owl. The first quit working after three days and we returned it for a replacement. The replacement won't quit hooting and hoots until it runs the batteries down or doesn't hoot but turns its head constantly until it runs the batteries down. We could have bought a stationary owl for $10, and a week or two after ordering this owl we saw a hooting owl for only $20. It may not work any better but we would have been $10 ahead."
2,Sensor is ineffective.,"The sensor is way off. It doesn't move or hoot until something is 1/2 inch from the sensor. If I knew it would not hoot or turn it's head like advertised, I would have not spent the extra money on the sensory kind. I would have just gotten a regular owl; as that has worked so far to keep the squirrels away. I chose not to return as I do not want to spend more money on S&H to return."
1,Don't order online,"Well, maybe this owl would have done the trick, but Amazon's vendor threw it in a HUGE box with absolutely no packing materials. It banged and bounced its way here and arrived broken (big shocker). What a waste of my time and money. My advice is to buy this from a local store where you can test it out before buying. And whatever you do, don't buy from the vendor ANTOnline."
1,Disappointed,"The first one of these I received did not work, I returned it and received a replacement. That one did not work either. I contacted the manufacturer and was told they have had problems with these. I gave up and returned the second one. As part of the process I discovered that these are not designed to work at night. I didn't see that mentioned anywhere, and I'm not sure how effective this could be against some critters that are nocturnal. I also want to mention that the mounting arrangement for the base is nearly impossible. The mounting holes are inboard from the body so you can not get a screwdriver on the screw heads to tighten them. Avoid this item."
3,Garden Owl - Batteries don't last. Range is short,"I found the range to be limited and short. The batteries did not last more than a few days when owl was set to both motion and sound.I gathered some stuff from Radio Shack and converted the owl from battery power to AC so I can just plug it in. No more battery problems. So far, it has kept the Osprey off my boat here on the Potomac River...Easy Gardener 8021 Electronic Scarecrow Garden Defense OwlEasy Gardener Garden Defense Electronic Owl"
1,Big disapointment,"I ordered one of these Garden Owls some time ago.It seems that they have a batch of bad Owls audio wise.They don't hoot!I sent the first one back and recieved a replacement with no problem.It wouldn't hoot either! I called you folks about it and you suggested that I call the company that makes them. I did and they were very nice about it. They sent me another owl about a month ago and it worked great up until 3 days ago and then it quit hooting too!I've gave up on these Owls although the people were very good about replacing them! I've haven't bothered to call anyone about this last owl yet, don't think that the product is any good!"
1,What a load a HOOT!,"After the pidgeons discovered our bird feeder and reading mostly positive reviews of this owl, I had to try one. The first day I was happily impressed- the pidgeons would fly by, the owl would turn his head, ""hoot hoot hoot"", and they would fly by. But by the second day, I was shocked to see 2 pidgeons at the feeder and a third pidgeon perched on top of the owls head riding it around like an amusement park ride!! HOOT HOOT HOOT! Oh yes, this thing really works- NOT! I wish I'de had my camera handy. So go ahead and try one. Maybe your pidgeons aren't as smart as ours. HOOT HOOT HOOT!!!!"
1,Don't bother,Owl did not work as described. Birds in tree made so much noise owl was not heard. My owl was a piece of junk and I returned it immediately.
3,Give a hoot...,"I have several blueberry bushes. Last year the rabbits and birds got all the blueberries. So, I saw this product and thought it would protect my berries and maybe I'd get to enjoy a few. I set it on the ground amidst the bushes, but it didn't seem to work being flat on the ground. I had to mount it on a pile of rocks, stake it down and still it only works if you get very close to it. Once it starts its hooting and turning its great, but I am not sure it will protect the bushes all that well. We shall see as the berries begin to ripen."

5,You'll like it!,Simply the best self-winding mechanical dive watch on the market for the money. The orange face version is more eye-catching than the black one.
4,"Cool Watch, Good price point","i looked around for a sport watch that not everyone was already wearing - and have enjoyed this one very much. The automatic watch is easy to handle as I do not wear this watch every day - the day/date setting is very easy to change. Also, i'm not bothered in the least with the accuracy of the mechanical watch.it's a nice watch and I very much recommend it to others."
1,runs fast !!,"ive had this watch for about a year. it is a stunning watch, looks beautiful...one problem, it runs very fast. i work for a netword news organization, and i need to one time at all times. My father has the same watch in black...it runs fast also."
2,watch arrived in need of repair....,The watch was offered for a good price for a Seiko. The watch arrived fairly quickly and was securely packed. The problem is I've set and reset the time many times but it remains fast. I had a local jeweler check the battery and he confirmed it was the correct battery and had plenty of life. The watch is under warranty but it will require me to ship it to Seiko for repair since there is no local Seiko dealer. I suppose the watch can be repaired but it was disappointing because I've purchased other watches for much less and they performed perfectly out of the box. This is not what I expected to get from a very reputable company like Seiko.
3,Seiko Orange Monster,"Sharp looking but I am disappointed in two things about this watch. 1) luminousity is short-lived but I've seen worse. 2) This is irritating.. I have to reset watch every morning. In 24 hours, it falls behind 2 to 4 minutes. But I've made it a habit each morning to reset based on computer, or cell, or atomic clock hanging in kitchen before heading to work."
3,Slow Monster,"This watch only receives 3 stars from me for only one reason. It constantly loses time. After having it a few months, as prescribed to let it ""break in"", I let it wind down completely and then reset it to monitor it ver closely for two weeks. On average, my watch is losing just about 27 seconds a day. This is during a cycle of wearing it during the day, resting it crown up at night and checking the time against a quartz digital that was set to www.time.gov.While 27 seconds a day is not a lot, over two weeks that was six minutes!!!. All of the features of the watch are of excellent quality. The fit and comfort of the watch, even though it is a heavy chunk of steel is very good. The case is really nice and the looks are great. Since it is a timepiece, I feel losing 2 stars for its lack of accuracy is justified.I am going to try and regulate it by resting it in different positions, then send it back if no avail."
4,"Great Watch, a Little Fast","I love this watch, and get many compliments on it. It's a nice size - it's big, but not too big like a lot of oversized watches that are all the rage.The power reserve lasts about 36 hours, so if you have more than one watch, you'll want to get an automatic watch winder.The only negative is that it gaines a few minutes a week."
2,Orange monster.......really!,This watch is far from being a monster. This thing is tiny!. Thought it would be good size but has a very small face.
4,Unfortunate problem,My brother gave me this watch when I became a paramedic. I love it BUT it needs to be reset to the correct time way too often and the local jewelers can't fix that problem. It has to be sent back to Seiko.
5,Stupendous Performances of Forgotten Romantic Concertos!,"There is a special excitement getting a recording of a piece of music that you have always wanted to hear, but there never was a recording of it.Granted, there is a recording of Richter playing the 1st concerto and Michael Ponti in the second, but these are hard to find as well! It is a Godsend,however, that Hyperion is doing so much to unearth these lovely concertos! The first is probably the better of the two, but the second has its own beauties and resembles the Liszt 2nd concerto. The performances are wonderful all-around, with plush sound. Alexander Goedicke is known in this country among trumpeters for his Concert Etude which is standard rep for college courses. This might be the only other piece we in the US have gotten a chance to hear! I like it quite well-it is very virtuosic with glittering orchestration. Coombs is a master pianist (I also enjoy his Arensky/Bortkeiwicz disc on Hyperion). Now maybe the Otar Gordelli piano concerto?"
4,Fine Russian piano concertos,"First I recommend you get all 69 piano, violin, and cello concertos in the Hyperion set. There are only a few romantic Russian piano concertos out there, so it is wonderful that we can discover these works by Glazunov and Goedicke through this great Hyperion collectIon. Highly recommended."
5,hey,"Well, I read your review, but I have been familiar with M for 4 years now, and of course, it doesn't hurt that I'm French. I've seen him in concert and followed him from bar strong audience to a bazillion people. Damn, I have to share him now! And we also go to the same grocery store which causes me to pass out on a regular basis. Second album is great - he was overheard saying he tried to put too much into Le bapteme, but that Je dis aime is more mature (sic almost). Also a very amazing performer, a great musician who was too insecure about his voice to do his own stuff, he was the main guitarist for many French musicians before he started opening his wings, thank the goddess.I truly adore the guy, sense of humor, music, style and all.I'm gonna go rate Je dis aime now."
1,ATTENTION: This is NOT the Robin Scott M !!!,"I first found out about this CD over 4 years ago. I picked it up thinking it was Robin Scott's M. Since I knew that Robin was heavily involved in World Muzik, I bought it and was ready for some more Pop Muzik. When I gave it a listen, I was surprised to find out that the vocals were NOT Robin Scott!!! I was lucky enough to speak to him a few months later and he informed me that he had nothing to do with this CD. In fact, this was entirely different M! Needless to say, I was NOT amused. Anyway, I just felt that I should rant about this CD and get it off my chest. Farewell and I bid you all good day."
3,An engaging story but does it work? Not yet!,"Being an employee of a company in the same business with Marshall I read this book with much aniticipation. Rob Rodin does a great job of detailing that changes that Marshall has undertaken and while the stories of the transition are amusing and insightful the facts are the changes haven't really made Marshall a more successful company from a shareholder standpoint. As the saying goes ""the bottom line is.....the bottom line"". By charting Marshall's stock price as compared to it's two largest competitors (Arrow and Avnet)over the past 5 years, Marshall's return to it's sahreholder's is the worst of the three. While it would be rewarding to read this book and know the changes Rob has made have added significant value, the facts simply don't bear this out. An amusing read but not really a guide for improvement."
1,This man is no dope!,"I worked for Marshall for 12 years. i was on the payroll for 13 years. i ate, drank, i cried with rob rodin. rob brought marshall from the bottom to the top. rodin knows of what he speaks, change is important, it is needed. the company changed. unfortunately, marshall management did not change. morale has been at a all time low since the early 90's. i am sure that many people feel ""betrayed"" with the recent sell-out to avnet. if i find 1 fault with rob, he is not a people person. rob took what made marshall (people) and turned it into a cold machine. sure ... great book ... great ideas ... good read. now lets see how those highly paid salary sales folks do in the real world of commissions! rob, good idea, but you never taught them how to hunt for their own food ... the good ones left ... the weak will die."
1,One more example of corporate ego and greed................,"Lo and behold, we witness one more example of a corporate ceo embellishing his ego, while lining his own pockets all in the name of the company, employees, and stockholders. Mr. Rodin and his cohorts get rich by driving his company into the ground, and leave 1,500+ loyal trusting employees and their families to flounder in an already overemployed industry. I can't help but laugh at the reviews touting his integrity and business acumen. However, the sound of my laughter is merely an echo compared to the sound of Mr. Rodins'... as he races all the way to the bank!"
4,engaging and enlightling,It is interesting to see a company manage to survive in a climate of upheaval..A interesting odyssey
5,Full of excellent insights!,This book is very good. I reccomend this for anyone who is interested in American Business process. It is certainly worth $17.50!
5,Innovative and compelling information.,"This book was an unexpected and welcome surprise after all of the mediocre to poor business books I've read over the last few years. It was well written, honest and most importantly it left me with a myriad of new ideas. This truly was a CEO with great vision. I highly recommend this book!!"
5,NOTEWORTHY AND PROVOCATIVE,"We are all looking for ways to increase our customer satisfaction and restructuring, if necessary, to do so. Rob Rodin's concepts are some that will greatly influence my decisions in the future. My staff has all been asked to read his book. I look forward to meeting Mr. Rodin at his upcoming NYC book signing and hope he'll give me the opportunity to discuss his ideas personally."
3,The parts that are true are great.,"Marshall was my place of employment for almost ten years. I believed in Mr. Rodin's philosophy. I believe you need to challenge employees and that change is good and inevitable. However Marshall management, manages by fear and lies. They do disguise it well with some great Rah, Rah speeches, however once you disagree with them you are on the list. So while alot of Mr. Rodin's ideas are real and impressive the moral at the company will always be low, ultimately causing great harm for the company. This is a management that promised no lay-offs, and then months later sent hundreds packing. Buy and read this book, and take the good from it. But please don't take all of it."
4,Jennifer is a star,"What a girl, beautifuall and talented this product allows you to see some of her best. Can't wait for more to come out."
5,A MesageTo Her Record Company JIVE RECORDS When do We get all her Music Videos on 1 Dvd,This Dvd is Nothing Short of Awesome Can I go Now and Barenaked Sound Wise This Dvd Is Top Notch With The option of Dolby Digital 5.1 and Stereo and Beleive me Its Loud as Sound And Crystal Clear Why Coudnt we have Had How do I deal on here to Better Stlll JIVE RECORDS When are You Gonna Release all her Video Clips On One Dvd For Her Fans I Also Plead to Jennifer Please Get The Rest of Your Videos on 1 Dvd for US
2,does not deliver on its promises,"Ok, so it DOES bring in at 352x240 with stereo sound, but it can only bring in with MPG1 format, not the best to begin with. If you plan to edit video on your computer then output it to VHS or back to the Camcorder, forget it. THIS SYSTEM CANNOT OUTPUT FROM YOUR COMPUTER. I ended buying the ADS Technologies TV Elite XGA to do the output with. I will eventually look for a system that can input at a higher resolution (preferably uncompressed full screen AVI). Until then, I will continue to use the DAZZLE system, but do not recommend it to anyone."
1,Crash-Crash-Crash,"The only product I've used that crashed Win2K with incredible frequency. 17 times in 5 hours, and I wasn't even capturing video. As for capturing video, prepare to be frustrated. Didn't matter how I set the program, it only saved to it's parent directory.I should've been tipped off when the box stated that it worked with Win2K, but the software and drivers weren't in the box.I ended up returning this for a refund/exchange."
2,Get ready to meet Dazzle tech support,The USB version does not work with soundblaster live sound card.It took me one month of writing e-mails to tech support. I finally broke down and called Dazzle support (no toll free number) and was told the problem was with the sound card and I should call their tech support. Like I said I have had this product for one month and still haven't been able to record a finished movie back to vhs tape.
3,Very useful for some tasks,"The Dazzle Multimedia DM4100 Digital Video Creator is very useful to import video from your TV, VCR or DVD player into your PC for editing and then converting to PC video formats. The device is exceptionally good for making videos for use on the Web or as e-mail attachments. Thanks to its use of USB its very simple to install and can be ""hot-swaped"" with other USB device without rebooting your computer.I don't recommend using the device if you plan on editing videos on your computer and want to export it to video tape. If you will be using the device primarily for making videos for web broadcasting there is an Internet version available that is optimized for this task. The Internet version also includes a RealVideo converter and encoder.The included software package is very useful and stable. However, the included Ulead Video Studio and Ulead Photo Express are not the most current version."
2,You get what you pay for...,"If you want a small, low resolution image that has unsynchronized audio (or you have forever to wait on the audio sync), this one is for you! Oh, yea, don't expect to be able to videoconference with your camcorder.If you want to capture home videos with no or low loss of quality and want it done at a reasonable speed, you probably don't want this one (or any other USB or similarly slow external connection)."
2,You'll be disappointed,"This product claims to have perfectly synchronized audio, which it does, but only when playing back a recorded clip on your computer. When viewing the input on your computer or outputting to a television, there is a delay of about one second from the time you hear something to the time you see it. This device does not function as a normal TV tuner or TV-out device, nor will it work for videoconferencing. You're probably better off buying an internal video capture device than going through USB."
2,"Worthless If You Want to Send Video back to a VCR/TV/8MM,etc","It's a great tool if you want to import your video clips into the computer. However, if you want to send them back out, the best you can get is 320x240 Resolution. Which is half of what you originally recorded it at. Or, in other words, bad quality. No thanks."
2,"Great for the computer, not for VHS","Like many of the other reviews, I agree that the Dazzle product created nice MPEG videos. I had no problems with audio sync but I did have to disable the preview mode because my computer (a 455MHz) didn't have enough processing power to keep up. My main gripe is when I tried to transfer the MPEG files back to VHS. in 50% of the cases, the Dazzle product froze up. In the other cases, I saw major decoding defects. Despite all of the troubleshooting and changes to my Windows 98 setup, it never worked very well. I guess you get what you pay for.Do yourself a favor and check out Dazzle's website bulletin page and troubleshooting to get an idea of other problems (most of which I also encountered)."
1,You won't be Dazzled!,"I purchased the Dazzle Video Creator in hope of transfering my analog vhs tapes into a digital format. It was a neat idea, a plug and play option that I could install without opening the computer case. Great idea, right?Well, this is where everything goes wrong. After istalling the software bundle and getting the Dazzle up and running I ran into severe problems. Mainly being the computer just wouldn't recognize the audio or sound files. Hey, no problem I'll just call tech support to get this ironed out. Much to my dissatisfaction I found out thier tech support was almost nonextistant. They never and let me repeat never helped me at all ever to get this problem ironed out.So save your dough and buy a real video capture card and save your money or you could end up let me with a totally worthless piece of junk that don't work."
2,Not pleased with product or seller,"I wanted to return the jelly bean headset and have repeatedly emailed the seller and as yet have never gotten a response. Set is heavy, and mouthpiece is large and annoying as it is in the line of sight. Pay a bit more and get a better unit, but not from this setter."
5,They don't write columns like this anymore,"This is a collection of columns by Red Smith, one of the greatest sports reporters who ever lived. He wrote in an unusual style, telling a story in his colorful way, rather than reporting the highlights of the game and throwing in some quotes from the players. You need to pay closer attention to his columns than to the average sports story you'll see in a newspaper today, but you'll not only find out what happened the previous day, you'll also be entertained by his writing.I've been a huge fan of Red Smith's ever since I heard his classic line about the horrible Packers team that finished a season with one win, ten losses and a tie. He wrote that they overwhelmed one team, underwhelmed 10 and whelmed one. If you got a kick out of that line, you'll enjoy this collection of baseball columns.It also gives you a good glimpse of New York baseball in the 40's and 50's."
4,An interesting take on Confucianism,"While Hsun Tzu's writings are interesting in themselves, I found that a comparison of his work to both Confucius and Mencius provides much insight into the ways of human life. Particularly interesting is Hsun Tzu's take a human nature versus that of Confucius and Mencius. All in all this is an interesting read for anyone interested in philosophy, ancient Chinese culture or human interaction and life in general."
4,I Enjoyed This Book,"This is a great book to read - adults and teens alike. I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about the early history of Canada, the Hudson's Bay Company, and the fur trade.The book is well-written and as a teacher, I highly recommend it."
5,Adventure: not just for boys anymore...,"Barbara Demers wrote a wonderful tale of a young orphan girl being shipped to the New World where she must learn to fend for herself. She finds much more than just a new continent with strange circumstances. As Willa explores her new surroundings, she also finds within herself a world of strength and knowledge to explore. This is an excellent book which contains a very engaging story that appeals to a girl's sense of independence and adventure. Although Willa draws on memories of her brother for strength as she begins her adventures, she eventually finds that strength within herself as she discovers that women are strong, and more importantly, she is strong herself. The brief historical afterword is icing on the cake! I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in historical fiction!"
2,Keep looking,"I am transitioning to tailwheel aircraft, so I am devouring all relevant information. I thought I would love the book, but it was average at best. A real disappointment, especially considering the price."
5,Taildragger,Outstanding review with all of the necessary detail to provide full understanding of what it takes to master tail dragger flying.
5,Great example of the show over the years.,"If you have never seen THE RED GREEN SHOW , it is like ""Home Improvement"" meets ""The Outdoorsman"". The show is done in stand-up comedy style as the lodge members relate to you the things that happened that day. This is broken up with filmed slapstick comedy segments , Handyman projects , strange guests , and much more.Purists wish that these were put on disc by season, but each collection gives you a good example of the series over the years.The video quality is only hampered by the quality of the original low budget production. For a DVD to hols so much, it is surprising that there is no digital aritfacting.I look forward to more DVDs in the future!"
4,Very dark,"This was a pretty good henti anime but was very, very dark in its storyline and ending, kind of made us feel weird..."
3,What you might expect from your avg porno....,"Some of the scenes were nice but the animation was a tad rough and some of the art just didn't look like it was colored correctly. And like most other animes there is a lot going on in the background that makes no sense. Then everyone gets killed or brainwashed...not very uplifting but, if thats your thing 'to each his own'..."
5,Relationships for a real Christian,"This is a great read for any Christian youth who wants to have a realistic picture of sexuality, love etc... Mr. Brown brings the ideas clearly from his life experiences and make a solid case for grace. He argues against leagalistic views on sex and love and dating... This book is a good gift for any one who wants to understand God's grace in regard to relationships with opposite sex.."
5,Tainted Love,"David Brown does an amazing job at showing the issues of addiction that is dragging the Christian community at large down. He uses an amazing mixture of his own life, scripture, poetry, and common sense to show us where we are falling short. I enjoyed the openess and honesty of this book!"
3,Improved drastically.,"I'd have to say, being a female, I'm very critical of the music I listen to, and if the beats are great but the lyrics are dead, then it's not worth my time. Slum Village seems to intrigue me with songs like ""Tainted,"" but then fall back again when you listen to other songs from their albums. Trinity was a disappointment, and their follow up was an improvement, but here, I felt like the beats and lyrics complimented each other...it's almost like a classic album...almost. ""Can I be me"" is my alltime favorite, and the following track ft. Dwele is beautiful. Though there aren't many tracks on this ablum, it's definitely worth buying and you money will be well spent."
5,Outstanding work!,"In this book, Professor Byock seeks to address a number of previously unsolved problems in Icelandic studies, including the development of the power structure of Iceland and some areas relating to the precise role of the chieftains. He succeeds quite well, and this work is sure to be a classic in the field.The bulk of the work describes the role of the chieftains relative to the bondir and the landless tenant farmers. He paints a picture which shows how different Iceland was from other Scandinavian nations, and shows how the society evolved with the chieftains functioning largely as power brokers and lawyers.Of particular interest is the analysis given to a few specific topics, such as the sources of income for the chieftains, and the social structures which provided mechanisms mutually beneficial political relationships."
4,Amazing,"The cd was amazing. It was totally what I was looking for. I bought it mainly because of one song,but I ended up liking all the songs. It is in great condition ."
3,Super tight!,"I have normal sized feet with the exception to some toes that are sensitive due to injury. I ordered the lg size of these and wear a 10 1/2, so should be good I thought. I had to pull and tug to get these tight socks on and they hurt they are so tight. I gave them to my girlfriend because they are very comfortable but be warned order at least a size larger unless you want compression socks."
2,Too small for comfort.,I needed an extra large sock for a 14 size foot. This sock is way to small to fit comfortably. People with little feet might feel just fine.
2,Not X-Large,"I bought three pair of these socks using a gift certificate because the ad read X-Large for men with shoe sizes 12 to 15. And they sported a hefty price tag. At any rate, I wanted socks that were bigger than the size 9 to 12 I can find in department stores. I wear a size 11 shoe. I like loose-fitting socks because I prefer to walk around the house without shoes or slippers. I knew I had wasted the gift certificate as soon as I tried to pull the first sock on. I could barely pull it over my heel. These socks are so tight that they cut off the circulation to my ankles. If I wear them for any length of time, they leave an imprint of the woven pattern on my feet and ankle area. I gave the other two pair away as Christmas gifts to a relative with a shoe size much smaller than mine."
3,"good sock, expensive price",The sock is comfortable and seems durable. I just don't think it is worth the kind of money they want for it.
2,Too Tight!,"I expected these to be loose and comfortable to wear around the house in lieu of slippers.However, they are way too tight around the calf and would only work for me when using them with high boots."
3,Very good socks but for a price,"These are fairly heavy duty socks, and they do wick the moisture away from your foot. They do the job they were advertised to do, but they aren't cheap."
2,"Wigwam socks...pulls, pulls and more pulls","It's a nice looking sock. It feels okay on my feet. But, there are an incredible amount of pulls after just two washings, especially considering the price of these socks. The entire sock has pulls."
2,its only 1 pair?,Nowhere in the description does it say that you get only 1 pair. $12 for one pair of socks? my fault for not asking first i suppose
4,Very good,"I learned what I wanted about Tony Dorsett. He was one of my favorite running backs. I didn't know much about his life and his book put things in prospective. However, there were things I felt he should have elaborate on, for instance, how he met his life and his girlfriend in college. He repeated himself a lot but not with the same words, but with different words saying the same thing over and over.Overall, if you are a Tony Dorsett fan, you have to get this book. Just learning about all of his awards is good enough! It's exciting!"
5,Brilliant,"We love this book. We started reading it to our (now 11 year old) daughter when she was three or four and it's one of the few books we absolutely WILL NOT GIVE AWAY (well, at least OUR copy -- we'll buy it for other people) because it is such a treasured part of her childhood.Giant Chawangas will always sink in our household!"
1,"CAN'T CLOSE IT AND IT JUST DOESN""T WORK",I bough this for my daughter and she was really excited but as soon as we opened it and tried to close it we were very disappointed. It is uneven and discolored. We tried and tried to close it but impossible. So really all we can do with it use it as a display on the shelf........VERY SAD
5,guess that its typical to cling to memories you'll never get back again and to sort through old photographs of a summer,"Wow. Amazing.Best Tracks = ""Exaltation on a cool kitchen floor"" ""The awful sweetness of excaping sweat"" ""A celebration among completion""Buy it. Now."
1,Never heard it...,"and pray to the gods that I never have to be subjected to this ""poetry"". Why can't we give negative stars?And, yeah, what Kel Brigance said..."
2,Not recommended,"The good news is they are cheap. The bad news is they are really cheap!If their intended use is for something like a boat tarp, and all you need is the female side, they might work alright as long as you get a really good mushroom when you hammer them together. I find a few lighter taps work better than trying to do the job with a single hit it out of the ball park smack. If you are trying to make a cover where these snaps are used to connect pieces together, then don't be surprised when you find out things aren't attached after a mild breeze. They come undone very easily."
2,maybe i'll use them one day,"i got these to fix some of my son's little clothes, should have listened to the warnings. much too heavy duty, would be great for jeans or a tough camping fabric."
4,Interesnting Character,"A set of stories fo Anarky, some when he's a villain, other as a vigilante. The idea is fine, and the stories are cool, not a MUST HAVE for batman fans, perhaps if someone grab again this character can make something epic of it, but is a good reading for rainy days."
4,More interesting on a philosophical level,"The writer of this character in DC has focused less on action in these comics and more on psychological and philosophical insight. He takes the character in a very science fiction oriented direction, which makes for some interesting plots.Perhaps the most intriguing part is where Anarky is face to face with Darkseid and they have a discussion with one another. It is a heated debate about the point of life and the reason people should or should not try to be good.So this is not an action emphasis, but rather following the development of this character, Anarky, as he explores the world around him. So if you are looking for mystery or action, this book will probably not be what you want. However, if you would like to take a journey of the mind in a science-fiction perspective, this one is it."
3,It's good comedy movie for Rajpal Yadav and Neha Dhupia's fan,"Santosh (Rajpal Yadav) is a simpleton, married to Shanti (Neha Dhupia). In no time their married life becomes a mess, and they are constantly fighting with each other. A troubled Santosh finds no respite at work either, where his boss (Ashish Choudhary) keeps telling him of how wonderful his own wife (Amrita Arora) is. Truth is, she is a nag, and her husband is almost as troubled as Santosh himself."
1,"Movie, 1 star; Sue Price's body, 5 stars!","OK, this is a terrible science fiction movie that makes no sense, looks like it was made for about $800 and written by an eighth-grader. And yet, I was (occasionally) riveted. The reason? Sue Price's magnificently muscled body. Her tremendous muscular development is showcased often and at every conceivable angle and sexual situation, making this, to me, possibly the sexiest movie ever made. The camera is truly shameless in drinking in her powerful physique. (I didn't mind!) If you love female muscle, WOW! here you go."
3,Nemesis 4,"A strange film which probably will appeal to fans of female bodyuilding more than to Sci Fi fans, as the star Sue Price is frequently nude. The film contains far too much talking and not enough action, but despite it's obviously tiny budget, it is visually very impressive with some stylish camerawork, brutal violence and very odd Cronenberg like special effects. A film which will enhance Albert Pyun's reputation as the 'auteur' of the 'B' movie genre & though it's not entirely successful, it is a brave attempt at reworking the well worn 'android assassin' theme."
2,Nemesis 4: Not what was expected,"As a fan of Sci-Fi flicks, I decided to check this one out since it what shot by a great director, Albert Pyun. I was quite dissapointed with the story line (mind you I haven't seen Nemesis 2 or 3) because I didn't know what the story was.Plus the flow was weird and had no focus. Regardless, I was in awe of the star of this movie Sue Price. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE HER. Her body is absolutely amazing. This girl is buff. She's not Gwenyth Paltrow in body or skill but she is quite riveting. Unfortunately, she seems to be walking around naked for about half the movie. Too gratuitous. Anyway it's bad but she is something to look at."
2,Not Much Happens in This Film,Female bodybuilder Sue Price returns for the fourth installment in the Nemesis franchise. She is a bounty hunter for hire who goes after one last kill. Things go poorly and she soon learns she has been set up and is the target of every bounty hunter in the world. She spends a lot of time naked and shows off her super-muscular physique but not much else happens. Most of the characters spend their time talking and talking and talking. This is by far the least action packed film in the Nemesis franchise. Its just plain boring. The special effects are just plain embarrassing. This film obviously had a very low budget and it shows. Avoid this snoozefest unless you like watching naked female bodybuilders.
3,"Workout more hard,Sue Price","The muscle of Sue Price is not to big.I'm very happy if she want to workout more hard and back to the next film with bigger muscle.The thing in this film where i not like is:she don,t appealing her muscle and the running time is too short. But i still like this film."
4,A Tall Order,"Now, think about it: how easy could it be to hide a mountain?You could hide a coin. You could hide a car, even. You could hide a cow. But hide a mountain? Wow.That's a tall order.Now, perhaps the context matters. As you read the book, you realize that the term ""hidden"" is not used in the meaning that the mountain is not viewable. Instead, ""hidden"" means that an alias had been attached to a very visible mountain for many years, and that its true name (I would not spoil the book for you by revealing it) had been hidden due to a bureaucratic mixup at the Canadian equivalent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.Great story!"
4,that wierd book,the book im doing my report on is hardy boys hidden mountain. It was written by Franklin W. Dixon. I really loved reading it was really enjoyable. I hope you like it!
3,Gass's wordplay addiction is indefatigable & unendurable,"From THE DOOMED IN THEIR SINKING by William Gass: ""My mother managed. She was what we call a dedicated passive ... liquidly acquiescent ... supinely on the go.""Supinely on the go. How I love that phrase. Unfortunately, Gass has an icky addiction to wordplay. He grinds out so much non-stop alliteration & assonance that I really can't blame anyone for hating him. It really is *that* obnoxious."
3,The Duct Tape King,"I ordered this for my husband's birthday....and we've had non-stop laughs since!!I WOULD like to see more of the recent episodes on DVD as well...Red Green and the bunch (""Rothchild's Sewer Sucking System"" is a scream) are a wild and crazy group and we try to never miss a Saturday night on PBS.You'll enjoy!"
5,Red Green's the Man!,"Think of a redneck Tim ""The Tool Man"" Taylor, and you have Red Green. This is one of those shows thats stupid and pointless, but really funny if thats what your into. If your into like Mel Brooks, Farrely Bros. and others like that, youll enjoy this show. He fixes everything with duct tape, and suggests you change the oil in your car every year or two. To use a quote from the show, ""Remember, if the ladies dont find ya handsome, atleast have them find ya handy!"""
1,"A disappointing ""pamphlet"" on implementing a Project Office","A short and expensive 56 page ""pamphlet"" on the rudiments of a Project, not on how to set up a Project Office. This is not a book and certainly is not good reference material. The ""book"" covers unnecessary information such as ""What is the Internet, What is a Client/Server System (what does this have to do with setting up a PMO?)What is a Project, A Readiness Assessement Survey (give me a break!) and other disappointing academia. NO MEAT HERE!"
1,Shocked at the price!,"At about fifty cents a page, this pamphlet is way over priced, especially for the weak material included. The book, ""The Project Office"" is a much better value and has more to offer."
5,Helps the understanding of physical concepts.,"It is really a great book. I'm a physics teacher in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It helps me make my classes more fun and interesting. Explanations are very clear. You will look at Physics in another way after reading this book."
1,Waste of money,"This item is the biggest mistake I have ever made in purchasing online.The rack looks good on sight, but after putting it together, which was easy enough to do, and putting on my fifty pairs of shoes the sides just started bending.I truly regret buying this item."
1,"Great for flip-flops, and that's about it!","Consider this: plastic may be the product of our lives, but it has serious limitations with this product. The forms are too thin to support more durable shoes that have some weight to them - like my husband's Allen Edmunds- and the feet literally collapsed inwards. This product is too dangerous and unreliable to have around small pets or children."
2,Disappiontment,This is a very huge disappiontment for me. I spent $40 bux on a shoe rack which tumbled to the ground. I try to assemble it as much as three times but the same thing happen. The online display caught my eye but the actual trial was a bomb.
2,Shoe rack fell apart,"This would have been a great solution to getting those shoes off the closet floor. It was easy enough to put together (with extra glue and a hammer). 5 months after getting this, I came home to all my shoes on the closet floor. The rack had totally twisted and collapsed. I did not put any heavier than normal shoes on the rack. Great while it lasted, but now looking for a new rack. Dont waste money unless you are looking for temporary solution."
1,Don't waste money on this,"very bad quality of plastic. After stacking the shoes, in three weeks the bottom most plastic leg started to fold and the whole rack came down. If you try to adjust, the metal rods start to fall off. I think it is good only during the time the manufacturer took the photo. Complete waste of money."
2,shoe rack,"This rack was very easy to put together and was completed in less then 5 min. It is a decent rack but a bit flimisy when it is standing. The rack will be great for light shoes, but if you intend to put boots or heavier shoes on it you will have to find a way to attach it to the wall.2-2-13 it fell and broke after it was over loaded , no way to fix."
1,"Looks nice, but not sturdy!","I saw this product and thought it was great. I've had this product for a few weeks now and little by little it started leaning to one side. Its supposed to hold 50 pairs of shoes, however it is not sturdy enough to hold the shoes. I took out some shoes, but it did not help. I do not have heavy shoes or boots on it, but it would be nice to have a shoe rack that holds every shoe I have without me worrying about it falling. It still leans and I am very upset about it."
1,Product not worth the money,"I bought this product and thought I was getting a good deal. When it arrived, I spend a half hour trying to put it together but it kept colapsing. I couldn't get the metal rods to stay in the plastic frames. I got frustrated after several attempts and I returned it the same day."
1,Not sturdy enough,"I bought this shoe rack because like most women I have too many pairs of shoes. Even though I have more than 50 pairs of shoes, I thought this was a good buy and would fit perfectly in my dressing room. I put the shoe rack together, placed my shoes on it, and left home for about 2 hours. When I returned the shoe rack was leaning to the side and some of the shoes had fallen off. I promptly unloaded, disassembled, and sent it back. Its not sturdy enough to hold 50 pairs of shoes. Still waiting on my refund...."
1,TERRIBLE!,"This unit fell apart after one week. It says that it reccommneds securing it to a wall, but there is no way of doing so-trust me, I tried and even showed hardware store photos. It is rediculous. Nothing is supplied ifone was to try to secure it. I ended up drilling a hole thru the plastic and making a huge hole in my wall, and untill on ehas 6"" screws, it will nto work. I do not reccommend this."
2,Amp did not work,I bought this guitar for my 10 year old son. When I received this item the Amp did not work. I had to go to guitar center and purchase an amp for the guitar. It works great with the amp that I bought for it. This is a real guitar. It's not a toy. My son thinks it's awesome. I would say that this guitar is the right size for a kid ranging from about 9 - 14. I would have given this item a 5 star rating if the amp had worked that came with it.
3,You get what you pay for I guess...,"Couldn't resist the price, which was about $[...] or so. The Amp is garbage, but the guitar is OK.Since this was intended to be a gift, it was lucky that we tried it out first to discover that the Amp was worthless. If you buy this, consider it on the merit of the guitar alone.The only negative on the guitar is that the pickup seems really weak. I'm not an expert by any means, but the volume had to be cranked up on a set of powered speakers to hear anything at all. But, when you have a young boy, that might be considered a positive!"
2,Not what I was looking for,"Ok, so these glasses aren't terrible but definitely not what I'm looking for. I was looking more for a pair of tactical shooting glasses, and they are not. The problems were that they weren't very dark, so its easy to track my eye movement (I don't want that) not to mention that for being polarized I sure got alot of glare. I did like that the glasses didn't touch my eyelids (I hate that) so for more people these glasses would be fine, for me, not what I'm looking for."
5,Excellent for teenagers to read,I bought it for my teenager and he read it.We discussed things from the book. Very informative
2,not good product,"I bought for my child and when u start it drives reeaaaally slowly, slowly in the water. no special movements or speed. china made. nicer on the picture."
3,Gravestoned,"A friend sent me the link for the trailer of the movie and since it featured a Scottish Terrier, my favorite breed of dog,I ordered a copy. The first part of the movie actually wasn't all that bad. A couple of parts made me laugh out loud. Unfortunately, the movie became less enjoyable when it got to the cemetary. Dancing, sex and murders were all badly done and sometimes painful to watch. No one seemed to be enjoying what they were doing. However, the very end of the movie was more like the beginning and I enjoyed it.Gravestoned"
4,Scot gets top billing,I definitely enjoyed watching this movie. Given the fact that it was filmed entirely with one camera and mostly at night the resulting film is amazing. I plan to enjoy it for many years to come. It will become a Halloween classic for my household.
4,Revenge of the Scotty,"This is an independent and not a major studio release and was obviously made with tongue in cheek and in the spirit of a60's zombie and teen drive-in epic. It flirts with humour interspaced with the walking dead but doesn't have the shocking gore of the ""Saw"" series. The cinematography is well done. A must see if you love Scotty dogs!"
4,Football Cleats,Bought these for my son for playing football. Well made shoe but he has found them tough to break in. Once he gets there they should be good to go.
5,Fun way to learn about other cultures and their native foods!,"Andrew Zimmern is the intrepid host of ""Bizarre Foods"" on the Travel Channel, and I have not missed a single episode! He is a wonderful host, taking a genuine interest in other cultures, always respectful and polite, and of course, adventurous in his culinary excursions! In this collection, some of the interesting and exotic cuisine to look forward to are lamb brains and goat testicles in Delhi, and rotten shark in Barcelona. Andrew Zimmern's Bizarre Foods is a wonderful, fun way to explore other cultures and 'sample' their native foods from the comfort of one's own home!I'm a fan for life!"
2,More Slandering of the Ukrainians,"First of all let me make clear that I do not have the slightest sympathies for the Ukrainian nationalists of Bandera. In fact my own grandfather fought on the Soviet side in World War Two. But no Ukrainians would want to bomb the Moscow olympics as many fellow Ukrainians would be killed too. The UPA (ukranian peoples army) contrary to popular belief was a fighting unit not a terrorist one as author makes you believe. It is still a good book with suspense and intrigue but as fellow reviewer said, the use of Islamic or neo-Nazi thugs instead of Ukrainian ones would be better."
2,Doesn't hold shape,"Because the surface of the ball is very smooth, it picks up any dust or dirt particles that might be on the floor. I wanted to use this ball as a chair, but the material is so stretchy that when I sit on it, the ball collapses to about half of its fully expanded height. I weigh 165 lbs. It also just doesn't hold its shape when I do crunches on it. Not recommended."
2,worked good until popped,"Exercise ball inflated fine, but popped within 2 weeks. I had filled it to the measured size of 29inches tall, and mostly certain there was nothing on the floor that could have popped it. :-("
4,Using as a chair,"Seems too work o.k. for a chair, but I missed that it was a 75mm ball, Must have been tired. I'm 5'6"", and should have gone with a 65mm. This will work, but smaller would have been better."
2,"Buy cheap, get cheap","This is cheaper than the GoFit ball, but it can't take the weight. For any guy over 220, this isn't the one to use."
4,"Good product, silly pump","Well, let me start by saying that i bought this product for physical therapy exercises because of lower back issues.This is where the fun begins, because the provided pump is a joke probably intended for one time use, and people with a bad back will really enjoy this one (not).Otherwise the ball appears of a good quality and actually looks good as well."
1,"Only got the ball; no pump, no stoppers","So, I ordered this ball because it came with a foot pump (and GoFit's didn't say). Only, I got what was obviously a returned ball in a broken box with NO pump and NO little stoppers to hold the air in the ball.I got a refund, tho, so then I went and bought a GoFit ball, and am happy."
1,Ball Deflated After a Week,"I love the exercise ball I have at home, I use it as a chair in my home office. I decided to buy one for my office at work and I bought this ball because it had the highest customer ratings. I used it for a week and then one day it deflated and couldn't be refilled with air. Luckily I didn't have a dramatic pop and get thrown to the floor."
2,Much smaller than size stated.,"The first 75cm max fitness ball I purchased (a year ago) was perfect. It got misplaced and with the price so reasonable I thought I'd buy another. While shipping was super fast, the ball was definitely NOT the right size. Its about the size of a playground ball. I kept it and my 3 and 5 year old play with it out back. Make sure you get the size yooure ordering!"
5,Best Gaming Chair Ever!!!!,"As the title says, I use this as my gaming chair now. I play video games for hours at a time sometimes and I am left uncomfortable, sore, and tired. This is the solution! Now I'm actually excercising while I game, I do sit ups while watching cut scenes, or in between online matches. My back pain is also gone. I got the idea from my friend who uses one and he was spot on. Also, just having this in your room will make you want to use it even when not sitting on it. It promotes a healthier lifestyle on so many levels.Important Notes:I'm 31, 6'3"", 260lbs...this 75cm ball works perfectly for me.Also, pumping it up took like 10 mins just so you know."
4,Foot pump is crap,Foot pump was a pain. Fell apart on me. Ball is great quality. Never worry about it bursting on me.
3,Exercise Ball,It is ok now. It was harder to get it to blow up than my previous ball. Had to work on it for a few days. Seems now to be close to advertised diameter.
5,Best value I found,"This seemed to be the most reasonably priced exercise ball I found while I was searching, and I'm impressed by the quality. It is HUGE, was easy to inflate (it did take me about 10 minutes with the foot pump though).I would recommend this brand and this particular product to anyone. I think for someone my height, I probably should have gone with one a little bit smaller, but it works just fine."
4,"Good product, weel made",This is a pretty good excercise ball. I bought it because it was just about the biggest one available. It is a heavy guage plastic and fairly rugged. It's a very nice ball for core excercise. The downside is that the foot pump is not great but servicable. It's just a cheap type so it's not a bad idea to have another pump like a bicycle pump. It works but takes time. I have no doubt that the ball will out last the pump.
4,"Good Product, Better Price!","Just received this a couple of days ago. I did not notice an odor as other reviews mentioned. The ball is made well and I'm not worried about it bursting. It is hard to get the plug out to refill. The pump works too.I've ordered and returned 2 other stability balls, but I'm keeping this one."
5,I love my fitness ball!,"The fitness ball is one of the most interesting new pieces of exercise equipment to come along in many years. It has many different uses, leaving you only limited by your imagination. TKO's fitness ball is strong and sturdy, inflates easily (at least mine does), and works great. So far, I have absolutely no complaints, and love my fitness ball!(Review of Max Fitness 75cm Exercise Ball with Foot Pump)"
2,Poor Quality,"I ordered this product based on the description and the price, yet when I received it it seemed too small to be a 75cm. I took the time to measure it and got a 62cm ball (not even the 65) I inflated it still giving it the benefit of the doubt but it still was short. It looks almost the same size as a 55 ball I have. Big deception in the quality since it still had residues of the manufacturing process. I am returning 30 minutes after opening the box. If you are looking for a ball between the 55 and the 65 cm this is the right product. I am giving two stars cuz the foot pump works fine."
5,Fantastic ball,So glad I read the other reviews and chose this exercise ball. Good quality and easy to inflate!
5,yes!,The ball is great. Fast delivery. Me and my husband both use the ball all the time. Anytime my back hurts i just use the ball and it feels really good. It's fun to use anytime even while watching tv.
5,Very sturdy,I use it for a seat at the computer. I'm a big guy and it holds me no problem. Definitely recommend.
1,Max Fitness Ball,The Max Fitness ball popped within one week of receiving it. It was supposed to be one of the tougher ones. We are very disappointed with this product.
4,"Recieved the wrong size, but it works.","I bought this to use as my office chair at work. It seems very reliable, and I have had no issue with it deflating. I was glad it came with a pump and it's nice to have around for whenever i will eventually have to inflate it. I ordered the 75cm but it looks like I got the next size down. I am a tall girl, 5'11, and I was disappointed, but I was excited about the purchase so i gave it a try. It works fine so long as it's fully inflated.It's nice to have a black one in the office, makes me feel a LITTLE less weird about having one.It's fun to bounce on during the day and it really has improved my posture.I love it."
5,Great customer service,"The ball is of very good quality, but there was a small shipping problem.After I sent an email, they were more than happy to help me, by sending me a new ball, along with the item that was missing, therefore, keeping my old ball.I will definitely consider buying from them other fitness equipment.Great seller!"
2,Not 75 cm.,"I bought this ball because I have a bad back and want to use it as a chair to help with spinal stability. Therefore, achieving the 90 degree angle between my hips and legs is *very* important. I bought the 75 cm ball because I am relatively tall. I inflated it, using a level and a hashmark on the wall to ensure that it was inflated to the proper size. At 65 cm., I was frightened to keep inflating for fear that I might over-inflate and injure myself. I took it inside and when I sat on it (at 140 pounds) it barely makes a dimple. Thus, I know I am at about max capacity. The angle is a little shy of 90 degrees so I guess I'll keep the ball until I can find a better one. Just note, if you are looking for a 75cm ball, this is not it (and just FYI - the box *does* say 75cm)."
2,Not an anti burst,"My husband, who is NOT a large man sat on it and was kind of rolling around on the ball and it popped! i don't think it was over filled and it was on carpet nothing sharp around."
5,Max Fitness 75cm Exercise Ball,"Quick shipping and a low price for starters, the included foot-pump works well to fill with air, but rather slowly. After the first use you can realy feel the diference, so overall a great product."
5,Just what I was looking for,"This fitness ball is the size I need, and the price I wanted to pay. The foot pump may be of flimsy quality, but it got the job done. I'm very happy with this ball & would recommend it to my friends."
4,"good quality, minor problems","This is a high quality fitness ball. However, it is definitely smaller than 75cm. It's probably about 70cm. Also, the pump is not very good and it takes a long time to pump the ball up. Still, given the price, I would recommend this product."
5,Amazing and fascinating book,"Every page has interesting, cool, and insightful facts.great book to have lying around, to read aloud, to share with others.I actually really like that it is written for kids, which makes it light, fun, and enjoyable"
1,WORTHLESS!!,"This is probably one of the dumbest, most worthless books I have ever read. Only the Koran has more lies in it. It is full of half truths, false information and downright lies. The book is not worth the paper it is written on. The authors have to be complete morons to expect people to believe the junk contained in this book."
2,You get what you pay for...,"As you can observe, this bit is a low quality rabbet which might suffice for a one time job but I have already discarded it at this point. It should be noted, the bit I received did not measure to an exact 3/8"" rabbet."
4,File transfer made easy,"Fast, easy to use. Very good at transfering files between computers, which is the reason I bought it. I would recommend this product as a great buy"
4,Good Product,"Card works great and no complaints except one. When I insert the card adapter in my laptop card reader, it locks the card and doesn't allow me to write. I'm not sure whether it is a problem with my laptop card reader or with the adapter."
3,"good product, ok deal","The product works fine, but I found a similar one for less on another website. Also it doesn't include a plastic case to protect it."
3,Want extra room on your phone?,"Simple and basic.Need extra room for pics or music?2 gbs should be enough.Works good or bad? Wouldn't be able to say.I guess good, as I haven't had ay issues.No news, on technology related topics is usually, good news.Saludos, Willy"
1,DOA junk for me,Just didn't work. Wouldn't work with several devices. Deader than Abraham Lincoln. Not worth a huge hassle of exchange. Kingston memory quality varies. It's a roll of the dice.
5,Excellent - complete compatibility with several devices,"Despite what some nay-sayers have said on several review sites, I ordered several different kinds of 2GB MicroSD cards for myself, my wife and kids' phones. I tried MP3 functionality on each of the devices (Blackberry 8300 Curve, Blackberry Pearl, and Motorola RAZRs with the different cards.The Kingston works great and I use it in the 8300 now on a daily basis. There are no compatibility problems with any of the MicroSD adapters on the phones that I tested. It's a great deal and a great product."
3,Flash Memory,"These media in different formats were for a project that involved microcomputers for which I was developing circuits and code. These cards allowed me to move data between different systems. Nothing special about them, but they worked fine."
1,Mrs Adair,Do not buy this product. The first card that I got did not work at all. Then they sent me another one and it could not be formatted.
5,Recommend it for all,"Excellent memory card, works so smooth without any missteps. Very good price and value in return."
1,Memory,"The incorrect product was sent, i was sent a 1gb card that doesnt even fit my camera, i will return and purchase elsewhere."
3,Way too small!,"So finals were just around the corner, and I needed to cram to the max! I figure the best way to review for my Swahili final is to use flash cards. I saw this product and thought it was 33% the dollar pack of flash cards at office depot. So I ordered them, but then I get them and there is only one! On top of that it is like the size of my pinky finger's nail. It seemed like it was an F for me this term, but then I realized that I could flick the card and make the clicking sounds that comprise the language anyhow. I should at least be able to get a C with this, so 3 stars."
1,Piece Of Junk,Dont bother buying this for the dingoo a320 doesnt work.And even tho it works with the computer it screws up sometimes and needs to be formated.
1,Dead on Arrival,"I bought the 2G card for my blackberry world phone dreaming of the tons of songs and pictures I could carry. However, the product was defective and reported media card errors. I tried it on different cell phones none could read them. When inserted in the housing and used on a PC, it worked but not just as the micro SD card.IT could be just this particular unit........... or perhaps Kingston is not ready for the 2G yet. I will try the San Disk, which has proved pretty reliable in the past."
4,At long last!!!!,"Finally, the good folks at Kingston have come up with the one thing that really needs a memory card. And that is a memory card. If you have memory cards that need memory cards, you know the frustration that this usually brings (i.e. hair-pulling, head-smashing, and tear-dropping).Now that I have a memory card for my memory card, I can only assume that my life will be infinitely more memorable (hey, buddy, make like Gerald Ford and pardon that pun). I cannot for the life of me, however, think what I will do if the memory card I put in my memory card runs out of memory. That is most likely when I will give up on it all."
5,Works as advertised,Item worked exactly as advertised. I had zero problems using this micro SD card with my PowerMac and Samsung U740 phone. The price was right and I would recommend to anyone who needs a micro SD card for their phone.
4,This works fine,"I am using this memory card in my Samsung 1.3 megapixel camera phone w/music player. However, I have to reconnect Bluetooth every time I finish transferring one song, and the phone needs to reboot before new songs show up. Otherwise this product works OK."
2,Bait and switch,Picture clearly shows a hard case. Was surprised no hardcase was included. I ordered three of these and keep losing them.
5,Kingston 2GB MicroSD,Item was brand new as described.Item was packed carefully and with more than enough material to protect it from damage during shippping.Shipping was very fast.Unbeatable price too.
1,Don't buy one to use in your phone.,"It would not work, everytime I put it in my phone or anyone else's it told me it was not formatted, and you could not format it with the phone. It's Ok to use in a camera."
1,Can I give a 0 for Customer Service,I bought this card in February and never received it. I wrote to the company and told them and never got a response.POOR! POOR! customer service. When ordering electronics be sure that it is not from these peopleI am still waiting for them to tell me where my chip is.
1,Do Not Buy For Phone!,"If you are planning on buying this memory card to put in your cell phone, DON'T!! Kingston along with sandisk are not compatible with most phones. Do not buy for yours!"
4,Works Like it Should,"It works fine. Perfect for Cellphones, computers, and R4 Cartridges. The only downside is that it can get misplaced easily because it's so small, but that's a users responsibility and not the card. Other than that, it's fine.=)"
5,great,"Its very much what it is...i have no problems thumbs up, plus it was delivered way before the expected time of arrival"
4,Just fine,"Product showed up in good shape, quickly. Has worked just fine so far in my Sansa mp3 player."
3,small compatibility issue,"works well in my palm tx, and my kodak camera, though it doesn't work in the sd slot on my dell laptop, but it did work using a usb sd card reader on the same dell laptop."
5,Best price I found anywhere,"What a bargain! The superstore that we all ""love-to-hate"" that claims to have the lowest prices anywhere sells their most economical 2GB microSD for twice the price. I bought one for each of my phones (2) and since I didn't pay shipping or tax, I came out way further ahead than buying just one from ""Uncle Wally"" down the road. Also, since it isn't an SDHC, it is compatible in some of my older devices should I decide to swap it out."
5,"bought more, good and cheap","exactly as above, price seems to have gone up. right after i purchased 2 more. hmmm... supply/demand? absolutly no problems though, and best price you can get."
1,DOA,didn't work with my Samsung T809; Samsung technical support had tried but didn't figure out if it was the phone or the memory card. Would have returned it if not for the low price and high return shipping cost.
5,Kingston 2GB Flash SD Card,"I love this card, it has plenty of storage on this card. might even consider a larger card for storage so you don't have to change cards as often.Jonoknee"
4,micro sd card,just what i needed for my new phone.. and then i can use it in my camera and can load all onto my computer
2,Good idea but card was bad...,I thought this 2GB card was going to be just what I needed... but it never worked. I eventually got a replacement from Kingston but only after a grilling from there tech folks because they said they did not support the use or their 2GB cards in the Garmin GPSMAP 60CSx unit I was using... I however was going on the advice of the Garmin website. I got the replacement and it has worked fine out of the box.
1,do not buy this product if it was made in China!!!,I use these adapters for work. My purchase from Amazon has a 60% failure rate and I am not allowed to return them.DO NOT BUY THESE HERE!!
2,I was not lucky,"I purchased one of this for my nokia e71, it worked fine for 3 months but after that one day it was not working anymore. My phone couldn't detect it, any of my computers could detect it, I cannot even try to format the memory. It's a great product, I guess I was just not in my lucky day when I received this accessory."
2,Misleading info,"I searched for ""mini"" SD and when I got the product, I realized it was a ""micro"" SD. It does come with an adapter to convert to SD, but it does not have an adapter for mini SD."
5,Works great w/3 formats,"I needed the hard to find mini SD, so I got this version with the SD, mini and micro. Best of all worlds. I use the mini to update the firmware in my telescope and the SD for images in my camera. Very affordable for all 3 formats."
4,NICE,I must say this product is great so far am using it in my blackberry and its working fine thanks .
5,Great value Kingston 2GB microSD card,I purchased one of these 2GB cards for my duaghter and one for my grandduaghter. They were very pleased as they can now shoot photos and video clips to their hearts content. Both cards fit perfectly into their phones and also into the card reader. They have no setup to worry about and worked great right out of the box. I would reccommend these Kingston MicroSD card to anyone wanting more memory.
3,Good value,"Easy to insert in Nokia E65 and load with files, pictures and songs. Also back up phone info. After about 14 days phone reported quote Corrupt Card - re-format? unquote. Lost info on card as expected but now working fully again. Not sure whether glitch was due to inadvertently running down phone battery or any other nascent problem."
3,great for about 3 months,"everything is great about this card. it worked immediatly, i never had problems and it was cheapest around. but after about 3 and a half months......pow! it just stopped working."
3,Great IF you have the one manufactured in Japan,"If you get the Taiwan one, return it. The Japan one works very well. If speed doesn't matter, these are both ok.Kingston (Taiwan)Write Speed - 3.90 mb/sRead Speed - 3.95 mb/sKingston (Japan)Write Speed - 10.2 mb/sRead Speed - 18.9 mb/s"
3,Does not come with the plastic case shown.,"I bought these on an Amazon sale when they were offered with Prime shipping. My primary interest, frankly, was the plastic case and the adapters. I have several devices that use MicroSD cards and It is often preferable to just plug the card into my laptop rather than use a USB cable connected to the device.A 2GB card is no great shakes these days. (I have a 32GB MicroSD in my smartphone.) Kingston is good brand, in my opinion, and the 2GB cad worked in a laptop computer and SanDisk MP3 player. No complaints there.The adapters are well made and, like so many other adapters, will probably be misplaced or lost in the not distant future.I am disappointed that the plastic case shown in the illustration is not included, so I knock two stars off the review for that misrepresentation.Jerry"
5,It's perfect for what I needed,"Like the title says, it's perfect for what I needed. I needed a micro SD card for my phone, and it works perfectly with it. No lagging up the phone when I look at files and/or copy files to and/or from the phone."
5,Awesome,"The card works beautifully in my LG VX8600 phone. It worked right out of the package, and have no problems saving files via USB or adaptor. I highly recommend it."
5,Kingston 2GB micro SD,Great product. Arrived fast and in origional case. Only problem was my HP laptop doesn't read it so I have to my Compaq PC. Other than that no problems
4,tiny card for a great price,"By the time I write this review, I'm sure it'll be even lower in price, but it's a deal. The adapter is great to have on hand, and the card fits in my phone. What more could I ask for? It holds lots of stuff in a digital format, too. In fact, it holds more stuff than I really know what to do with."
4,It's just a micro SD card,"It's just a basic 2G Micro SD card with the adapter slot. That's all it says it is so that's what was expected and received. It's nothing anything super special it works in my camera, it does its job."
3,Good Value but....,Doesn't work with my Blackberry. Blackberry keeps complaining about the media errors. But works fine when I copy files on the card using a adapter.Also works well with my Samsung digital camera. So may be it is my Blackberry cell phone.
4,Amazing product for the price!,"I purchased this SD card a little unsure about the quality that I would be receiving. Low and behold, I received a fully working micro SD card and a full size SD adapter. They both are amazing! This allows me to take pictures on my camera using the full size SD adapter, then transfer the pictures to my phone using the micro SD card. Once the pictures are on my phone I am now able to transfer them to my computer wirelessly (bluetooth). So far this is a really solid product, but the data transfer speeds aren't the fastest. I am a light user of my camera, and this does not effect me. But if you are going to wan to take 3 pictures in 3 seconds then look else where for a card.Pros:1)Size of storage '2)Versatility of the medium3)PRICECons:1)The data transfer speeds"
4,Couldn't ask for soemthing better,I love my samsung phone 2gb memory card. It holds a lot of songs and I got it in the mail really fast!Thanks!
4,Cheap Gold Card,"I purchased this card to make it a gold card used to root certain android phones. Not all micro SD cards can be used for this but this one works. 4/5 because there is not a reusable case as picture, rather just a cheep package. Great price on the card with the adapters being a bonus."
2,Great game... too bad,"This is an otherwise excellent game that unfortunately uses the intrusive copy protection software known as Starforce. Normally I don't care a whit about copy protection, but Starforce installs itself as a hidden hardware driver and sits between your IDE / SATA hardware and the operating system. This causes all kinds of system glitches, crashes, slowdowns and on occasions requires a complete reinstall of Windows. Much of this comes from careless and poor programming - but the truth is, as long as the game is protected, the publishers don't care at all what happens to your system. This attitude makes little sense, really since it only takes about a month for the latest protection schemes to be broken anyway.Oh, and as an added bonus, the Starforce garbage remains on your system even after you uninstall the game. And the Starforce folks won't tell you how to remove it."
3,Not a product for old people.,"I had to put a strip of contact cement around the top to get enough purchase to get it to work for me. I'm one of those old people. It does fit into my spice rack though, and my coffee grinder goes back to grinding coffee exclusively."
2,gripping is difficult,"The grinding adjustment knob and the mill are small in diameter, round, and highly polished. You may have difficulty using this mill if you don't have sufficient grip strength."
4,"It's a Peugeot, Pepper Mill","I wish all restaurants have pepper mills on their tables. Since they don't, I can carry this 4"" stainless steel pepper mill by Peugeot Reims in my pocket. The ties on the pouch do weat out."
2,"Beware, if you're using for cat kibble...","...the label says that this container will hold ""15+ pounds"" of cat kibble.However, when I tried to pour a 15 pound bag of food into it - it was not even close to holding it all. So now I have a lovely airtight bucket filled with cat food...and a partly-full bag sitting next to it. Sort of defeating the purpose. However, that issue aside, I have a huge one for dog food and I love it.Great product, just take the capacity suggestions on the label with a huge grain of salt."
3,Love The Watch - Hate The Bracelet,I own several Invicta Diver watches and one of the details I like about this series is the quality of the stainless steel bracelet watchband. However I was very disappointed at the finish of this watchband. The predominant finish on this band is brushed rather than polished with just a few of the links being polished. The picture and description didn't really describe the bracelet in detail and led me to believe this was polished rather than brushed. Shame on me for not confirming the finish - but just so you know if you are looking for a highly polished finish watchband on a diver this isn't the watch for you.
3,An okay daily watch....,"I purchased this as an everyday watch. It lives up to that. After owning the watch now for 4 months, I can say that the two things that bother me are the fact that it seems to gain time, and the movement mechanism is somewhat noisy if your ear is near it.As an everyday watch it's okay --- does what it is supposed to do."
1,Disappointed...,"The book is amazing!! Excellent photographs by excellent photographers!but...I bought it used and that was my mistake...The book came in time, i started reading it, i was really excited, but some pages were missing!! It did not affected me at first because it was 1 page only... but then i realized that more pages were missing... A lot of them!That was on the bad side...On the good side, customer service was amazing, they replied my emails really fast, and they gave me the option to chose another book from their collection.Its an awesome book!!you can learn a lot about this photographers!!"
4,Pure fun!,"Slightly claustrophobic, three-character thrillers don't come any better. (Yes, there are more than three characters, but only three primary characters. Well, maybe four...) Taylor, Harvey, and Whitelaw are WONDERFUL in it, and the twist ending is just that - a real twist."
3,"Night Watch, the movie","The movie was based on a story by Lucille Fletcher. I was familiar with the play, based on the same novel. I will be producing the play in the Spring of 2013. I ordered the dvd to study the characterizations and the production requirements as they would apply to my play. I was disappointed in the movie, because it gave almost complete emphasis on Elizabeth Taylor, to the detriment of the story and the other characters. On its own, for people who are not familiar with the story, it is a good thriller and Ms. Taylor did well. People will be surprised at the ending. Sets, etc. are beautiful. So if you want a thriller in the same vein as Suspicion, Gaslight, and Rear Window, you will be satisfied."
3,Night Watch,THIS IS AN ODD LITTLE BRITISH PRODUCTION FROM LATER IN TAYLORS CAREER. THE TWIST ENDING IS PRETTY MUCH ANTICIPATED BUT HAVING NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE IT WAS WORTH WATCHING. IT IS NOT REALLY A SCARY MOVIE OR A HAUNTED HOUSE MOVIE...MORE OF A B-GRADE PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER.
4,Night Watch,I saw Night Watch many years ago. The suspense kept building and you read more into the film than what was actually there. The story line kept you riveted and the ending stunned me as it totally altered the whole plot. Excellent acting and direction.
4,Great Movie!,"I actually ordered this movie for a friend of mine who is not as computer literate as he'd like to be but loves Elizabeth Taylor and is trying to expand his collection. He said that the movie was in excellent shape and had no flaws when he watched it. He particularly liked the condition the cover was in and was very pleased with the timely arrival of his purchase. Thank you for making my friend so happy and I hope you get a lot more business.Signed,Chris CaseyHappy Customer"
2,Spend your money elsewhere,"I found the book to be inadequate to the task. There are lots of lists of what to consider, and what should be done, but very little in the way of practical case studies. Much of it is the sort of blinding obvious stuff that isn't worth the time. A random example--page 272: ""For example, if you wanted to present the status of all operational areas as to schedule, you could simply list them on the slide in various colors such as: Green--ahead of schedule Yellow--on schedule Red--behind schedule."" Much of the book is repetitive. The same information is presented, and even referenced as such! At least it fills up the pages!My advice: keep looking. I paid the 96 bucks, but shouldn't have."
4,2 cd's for the price of one.,"Okay, before you order Legions of War, keep in mind this is not a new album. That's what I thought when I bought this. You get 2 cd's, Grand Declaration of War and European Legions(Live cd). If you already have both of these cd's don't buy it. Otherwise, it's a good deal. The sound quality on their live cd is good. My question is, when are they going to release a new album????????"
2,Needs an Update,"Good concept - covering all the US National Parks, but the production quality isn't there and it's difficult to do some of the parks justice in one hour, let alone cover so many in that timeframe. At times the video feels more like someone's home movie footage, and the audio ends up being annoying."
1,Not worth the money,"This video was awful. The quality was so poor it looked like a very bad home movie. Showing blackangus cows standing in a field as a representation of Texas?? Really!! The most ridiculous scene wasof the hummingbird and wasp fighting at a bird feeder for several minutes, what has this to do withNational Parks? Silly video. Get Treasures of America's National Parks DVD set instead, these arefabulous."
1,"Disappointing DVD, Poor Video Quality.","This DVD is not good, I am not at all satified.....as the video quality is not good, it looks like unprofessional video. In this age of HD, this DVD's video quality is quite poor. Also sometimes sounds in video are annoying. Locations in this DVD are also not shown properly.I was totally disappointed after seeing this DVD."
1,Astonishingly Amateurish Production!,"This video is the poorest I have ever seen, bar none. It is reminiscent of high school productions, with poor video and very poor audio. Just awful - don't waste your money - I wouldn't pay one red cent for this if I knew in advance how poor it was - I can't believe Amazon would allow such a horrendous product on their site. If I could give it less than one star, I would. It's beyond comprehension how other people thought this was a good video - they must be the fellow high-schoolers who produced it. Shameful!!"
4,Ok,"Did not realize at the time of purchase that the item was shipped from Hong Kong. Shipping is fast, but there is no expiration date on the item (maybe originally there isn't)."
2,Nice Monitor (when it works),"The monitor is clear, bright and sharp, with a comprehensive set of adjustments available. Unfortunately it goes black with a vertical line down the center after about an hour or so of use with graphics heavy applications (aka games). Once it was allowed to ""cool down"" it would work fine again for another hour. Thank Heaven for Amazon.com's return policy."
2,Never Again!,"I have had this monitor for over 2 years. It's reliable, but the display quality leaves a lot to be desired. There's terrible moire that's hard to get rid of and the edges and corners never look right. I have played with all the buttons until my finger tips started to hurt. I went with NEC's reputation and bought the monitor sight unseen, a decision I have regretted ever since."
1,Don't get this monitor if you value your eyesight,"About a week ago I had my 17"" Dell monitor ""upgraded"" with the AS 95F. After one day of use my eyes were burning. The monitor has an annoying flicker in the lower right corner, regardless of the refresh rate used. There are also light horizontal bands present in the white backgrounds. My friend in the next cube has the same problems with his AS 95F as well. I would rather have my 17"" Dell monitor than the AS 95F.Since visual quality is the most important feature in a monitor IMHO I gave this model a rating of 1. I would not buy it."
1,Not that good,"Exactly the same problem as the other guy after running games and stuff, it will shut off. it [makes me mad], if you want this monitor for games might as well return it right now, ive looked at other places with reviews and they all have the same problem, its a bad product."
1,i got a defect :\,i got a horrible defect. on the left of the screen is a line going straight down the middle. on the right of the screen there is about 3 inch bar that is blurred going down from the top to the bottom. now i gotta send this beast back :\
1,Three hours you'll never get back,"I can only imagine how painful it must of been to ""act"" in this film. After the first half hour it was like a train crash to watch. Do anything you can to get out of sitting through this."
5,An awesome and entertaining Internet guide,"""Awesome Internet Sites for Kids"" certainly lives up to its title. The nearly 300 kid-friendly websites surveyed by co-authors Sandra Antoniani, Robyn Rektor, Lisa Slage Robinson, and Fiona Rowan cover everything from animals to world cultures. Each entry, geared toward nine- to twelve-year-old readers, provides a pithy description of a particular site's contents and a helpful age-range indicator. (My sons have especially enjoyed the Jokes, Music, and Fun & Games sections.) Colorful illustrations by Terri Lee, along with ""Did You Know?"" and other sidebar features, make the book fun for all ages."
5,Great Children's Internet Book!!,"I don't know why anyone hasn't reviewed this book yet! My daughter received this book for her birthday a few weeks ago and she just loves it! I find this book to be very safe for my children to use. I don't have to worry about them going to an inappropriate site! Aside from all the fun sites, they find the information sites a great asset for their homework assignments. It helped my children to see that the Internet has so much more to offer than they were taking advantage of. I found some great sites for myself, too. This is definitely a great book for children to have! The little Smorkie guy is really cute, love the graphics!"
5,love it!,this book was exactly what I was looking for for my little one. It has a classic feel to it that will not go out of style.
4,such a cute book!,"I have the previous edition of this book for my son who will be turning 2 tomorrow. I loved it so much that I ordered this new version for my new baby that is due in February. There are so many precious quotes and vintage inspired images in this baby book. It has a place to write about all of your memorable experiences, document your family tree, and many other important memories. I highly recommend this to any parent! The only thing I think this book is lacking is a folder or envelope attached to the book to keep all of your precious mementos (hospital bracelets, first curl, etc.). If this were included it would be perfect! I hope this helps!"
4,Every thing is good but!,I recieved my items and i was very satisfied with everything except my baby book which was very nice and had everything i could want except that it has some kind of stains on the back that dont go away thats why I give it 4 stars and will contact the seller
5,Beautiful retro style book.,"I love this book and the price is just right! I had looked at some much more expensive record books and decided to give this one a try because it was affordable and had some great reviews. The book is large, has plenty of room for each subject and photo, all combined with a soft vintage look. It covers a lot of subjects that other baby books don't and also has spaces for family members to write their thoughts and wishes, which I thought was a great surprise. I have already started filling it out and have to say I think it would make a perfect baby shower or early in pregnancy gift! Will be buying this again for others."
5,the best - done right,"From song selection to arrangement to production to guest artists to Solomon Burke at the top of his game, this is a collection for the ages. So good in so many ways, you can play it again and again and never stop marveling at the power of the performances. Go, Solomon!"
4,Works fine as a halloween costume.,"This is a typical Halloween costume made out of the cheapest material possible. I'm very glad I was able to fit my 30 yr old body into a child size Large. I'm 5'1'', 110 lbs. I wanted cheap and cheap is what I got. I look forward to rocking this for Halloween."
1,Horrible!,"Cheap piece of junk. It's short in the length, but the sleeves are long and droopy, and the collar is large and clownish. Super cheap material, which is see-through even though it's black (!) and the belt is just an unfinished strip of fabric with a cut-out piece of silver fabric for a 'buckle'. I was so annoyed when I opened it, even before she tried it on. But it was too late to get another costume, so we just used a white button-up under a black sweater, and a school uniform skirt with chunky mary-janes. Seriously, I could have made a better version of this costume myself with material from the dollar store."
1,"Cheap, did not fit.","Of course the costume was cheap looking, you get what you pay for. The fit was terrible, ended up having a dress made for my very disappointed ten year old."
5,Loved it!,I'm a 25 yr old...had a Halloween contest at work...we did the Addams Family. I bought this Child's Size Wednesday costume because of the price and because it was the only one I could find online that was appropriate!! I'm 5ft tall and weigh 120 LBs...it fit perfectly!! LOL everyone said I looked just like Wednesday!! Material is thin-I live in FL so not an issue. Overall great value and I would recommend this costume. Didn't look cheap and I'm sure I could use it again :)
1,incomplete,"The guide is not worth the money ! It is incomplete , the very end of the game is not even in the book ! There is another fight with Antonius that is much harder and a battle with Sextus . Worst of all the not so easy battle with the twins !No explaination , no strategy , no nothing that is helpfull .Do not buy this guide . Consider the intelligence and mentality of a person who insults my mother over a review ! After the cage fight with antonius the guide ends and the game continues with a long fight in the city and 3 boss fights . Shadows of Rome is an awsome game , one of my favorites , but the guides is not worth th $ ."
3,Fights ARE missing,All the fights described by the second reviewer are actually missing from the guide which is frustrating as a guide is supposed to be comprehensive. I thought there would also be much more detailed maps for finding coins as well - not just the in game graphics.
4,"Really nice bedding, but...","I received this set at a baby shower back in 2005. It has held up really well. My only advice: with a retail price of $232.00 and even an Amazon price of $152, it's still too steep. I never had the quilt in the crib because it is dangerous to do so with a baby - and he was constantly napping, so I hardly ever ""made"" the bed. Next time around, I'm going to find a pattern I like and just buy all of the decorative things associated with it, then buy an inexpensive and plain bumper and sheet. The room itself is what you and everyone else sees. The bedding is almost impossible to see, unless you're hovering over the crib.I do especially love the lamp, switchplate, mobile and 5-pc wall hanging from this collection. You could buy all the accessories to truly create a safari room for less than the cost of the bedding alone."
5,"Great Design, Great Price...Our son loves it","I'm a Daddy and don't post reviews much, but I had to for this one. No nursery set theme compares to this one in design or price...6-piece for $189?? Great for boy or girl....The wall hangings and accessory stuff is pretty fun too..."
5,music composed and conducted by yannis markopoulos:byron/you,"please kindly note that i order cd is ""music composed and conducted yannis markopoulos:byron/young aphrodites..."" notBrightness Reverberations~ Yannis Markopoulos ."
1,How did this get published?,"This was the most poorly written, poorly organized books I have EVER read. The reason I bought it was that it is the only book I found that discusses teaching English in Japan. Unfortunately, this part of it is overshadowed by the ridiculous sections on relationships with Japanese women. The relationship sections were shallow, awkwardly written, and full of narrow-minded generalizations. The only useful nuggets I found in this book were the author's descriptions of his everyday life as an English teacher. Unfortunately, these were few and far between, and buried in trash. This author couldn't make up his mind if he wanted to write a travel/reference book, an autobiography, or a relationship book. What were the editors thinking?"
3,I was disappointed with this one.,"I bought the book, ""Too Many Songs by Tom Lehrer,"" by, none other than, Lom Lehrer. With that book I bought this one. This book only has 12 songs while the one I mentioned first has 34 songs and is much easier to read. On top of that the other is $3.35 cheaper! Granted, this is a limited edition book, which is what made the price seem reasonable and why I gave it a third star. Both have almost identical piano, guitar chords, and vocal score. Please write me for a more detailed opinion."
3,Some step aerobics,"This product isn't too bad, because the step portion is approx. 15 minutes. It has some different moves that were not on my other workouts, but I thought there would be a lot more step because of the cover. The rest of the workouts are not good."
3,not as pictured,This set comes with 2 seat covers with no seperate head rest cover as pictured. Otherwise material seams fine.
5,wonderful collection,"As a Fats Waller fan of many years, I was delighted to find this collection on C.D.'s. The seller was great and I will continue looking for other such products."
5,Fats Forever,I purchaed this item for a birthday gift. My friend loved it and you will too. Another great Amazon purchase.
3,"It's OK, just not one to keep around.","I purchased this for my husband as a gift. He is an avid reader with a wide variety of interests. His opinion of this book was that it was ""OK"" but not one of his favorites and gave it to me to pass along. The story line and writing is mediocre."
5,Great gift...,"This book was a father's day gift and my father has absolutely loved it. He's not normally much of a book person but he's had a hard time putting this one down. If you have a Chuck Norris/Walker Texas Ranger fan in your house, like I did, then it's the perfect gift for them. Looking forward to getting him the second in the series for Christmas or his birthday."
2,Chuck's my hero but I'm disappointed,"While historically interesting, I found the characters almost ""cartoon-like"". They were stereotypical and predictable. Frankly, I was disappointed in the characters and the plot. It needed some twists and turns......more meat on the bones....more ""Rapp"" and ""Reacher"" in the wilderness."
4,Charachter development,"Character developemnt: Chuck Norris does not develop characters in his novels, he roundhouse kicks ""the muse"" until characters are developed for him."
5,great insight on a life of a contemporary artist,stunning pictures offering an intimate view on clemente. A truly beautiful book.
2,Wandering and unfocused . . .,"I read the first two books of the series and was disappointed in this third. Too many rabbit trails and extraneous detail about WWI for me. I'm a Tracie Peterson fan, but this book . . . seems like she was just finishing up loose ends, pumping out a book. Plot, character development, and passion were just not up to her usual standards.I have come to expect more from one of my favorite writers."
2,Not much to recommend here,"""Poorly paced; forced plot; tragedy after apparent tragedy; lots of 'huh?'s; shallow. Finally over!"" That's what I wrote in my personal book journal. Somehow I made it through the whole series--skimming at times because I was so bored--but it never succeeded in reeling me in. Characters and relationships had the potential to be memorable and endearing but were insufficiently developed. I felt cheated as I would love to have gotten to know some of these people! The pace of the story was uneven--lurching into unbelievable places then dragging as characters dealt with what had happened. Disappointing from such a popular novelist. Two stars instead of one because, despite the story, I was at least given a glimpse of what life was like in early 1900's Alaska."
3,A little disappointed,"This book was pretty good but not nearly as good as the first of this series, however it's worth reading if you have read the orhers of this series"
2,Doesn't come close to the first two in the series...,"I absolutely loved the first two books in this series (and all the books in the Yukon Quest series); however, this book left a lot to be desired. Not only did the plot jump around way too much for my liking, but it was very boring. There was not really much action of any kind. Also, by the end of the book, I seriously felt like just about everyone had died. I mean come on, I understand that Alaska is unpredictable, but seriously do that many people have to die in one book?So all in all, unless you're really desperate and just have to know what happens to Jayce and Jacob...don't read this book. And if you DO really want to know what happens to the guys, just check the book out from the library or borrow it from someone, it is most definitely NOT worth the money..."
1,"ho-hum, florence ...","Possibly the most boring, pointless book I've ever read (and I do read a lot) - - no flow, not interesting, and the book does a dis-service to a fascinating town, despite the un-fascinating ""celebrity"" stories that Mr. Leavitt goes on and on and on about ..."
3,"not that bad, but not that good","This small book is not as bad as the the one stars say, although several of their reviews (the longer ones, not the short little jabs) have good points to make. It's also not as good as the five stars say. The book does present some good stories about Florence, such as the moving of the David and the flood clean up, but leaves the reader wanting. It's like reading a UPI spot on the sidebar of the newspaper. Those that complain about the homosexuality, well, that's also part of Florence's history, and as Leavitt himself is gay, what would you expect? The name dropping that Leavitt indulges in is annoying and mars an otherwise fine little book. This book needs to be expanded upon to make it truly shine, with some editing to remove the author's self-aggrandizement. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but you might be able to get it for a penny from the used book guys."
1,"Pompous, Boring, Never Elegant ...what was he thinking?","A slim volume on one of the world's great foreign destinations, so one would expect something elegant, insightful, witty perhaps, something evocative of the place.Unfortunately, I don't there is a paragraph in his book that evokes anything about what it is like to visit or live in Florence. It's certainly not worth reading as literature and it doesn't take you there from your arm chair.This book is just a boring rendition of sort-of famous people who lived or live in Florence, coupled with David Leavitt's intention of showing you all the famous or important people he knows. He evidently thinks people will one day be writing about his life there.This isn't about Florence -- it's about the author's evident obsession with effete men of letters and his desire to be one."
3,"A unique and engaging break from a ""travel"" book","This new series proves to be a very helpful and interesting one, if a bit subjectibe, and Laevitt's work on Florence is compelling indeed. My main problem with his writing is the same problem I have with the rest of his books I've read--one senses he considers himself and his experiences a bit too highly for anybody's good. But while he's not an ""original"" or a first-rate cultural observer or ""arbiter"", his learning is put forth in lucid, intelligent prose--with many nice touches."
2,Random reminisences about the expat community in Florence,"Except for one chapter about the foreign volunteers who helped save Florence's art treasures after the disastrous flood in 1966, the book is large a disconnected collection of gossip about expats in Florence who for the most part were obscure or unknown. The thread that connects the different people seems to be that they were all gay."
4,An unexpected delight!!!,"I caught this movie on HBO. The title may lead you to think it a B (maybe a C) movie. It ain't, unless you think boyfriend/girlfriend body painting is anything less than delightful.You've heard of writer's block. This movie is about a painter afflicted with painter's block. The first three or so minutes are character development; only then do you get the first nude scene.The actors even look like they're having fun....."
1,One Star or Less.,"I feel like an idiot for buying this because I thought that I would have been able to look at the rest of the articles in the book, as well. There is no information here that I could not have found anywhere else. Perhaps you could include the other articles so people do not become enraged that they have been kind of ripped off."
4,We love 'em!,"We have had this phone for over a year and realy like it.We got it at target not online. We have enjoyed the speaker phones and that we have 3 phones with just 1 hook up.We've had great range and have very seldom been cut off, when we were, we were out side a ways away from the house."
5,Great replacement and easy to use,Bought this on sale to repace cordless headset phone. This was intended just for my use but base ended up replacing defective unit in main house. Love being able to check voice mail from handset. Great hands free with speaker phone option. I have not had any negitive issues with this phone. Only wish it had a jack for external headset.
4,A good cordless phone,We are enjoying the convenience of having the answering system actually on the headset. And to be able to have the phone book on the headset.
2,Nothing new in the world...,"The only reason you're remotely interested in this album is because you love The Church, right? But you've bought every other Marty Willson-Piper CD and none of them have ever quite delivered on their promise. Well, you think to yourself, maybe this is the one. But you'd be wrong. Unfortunately, this album consists primarily of utterly silly and insipid love songs, crooned out dripplingly, as in post nasal. And yet, like all the other Willson-Piper albums, there are moments of pop bliss, primarily when he stops singing between the bridge and the final verse in any of these songs, and the musicians jam for a minute. Then you hear the intricate patterns of melody that only Willson-Piper can construct. My advice, don't buy this album, just take out one of your old ones, dust if off, and play it again."
4,"Great reading and a start for ""realismo mágico""","Bemelmans' account of his trip to Ecuador in the 30's is not only very readable material, amusing and instructive, but can be considered the first example of what we now call ""magical realism.""His narrative of his multiple encounters in South America as the second world war was developing in its initial stages clearly exemplifies the difficulties for reality to adapt itself to a fast changing world.Much more than a travel book, ""The Donkey Inside"" (forbidden in Ecuador when it first appeared there, back in 1941) is also a powerful tool to understand a very conflictive period in that country's history.Pedro Saad Ecuadorian Historian"
5,The true feelings of Christmas!,"I have purchased as many Santa Claus prints, by Tom Browning that I could get my hands on. I had always heard the expression, ""A Picture Is Worth A 1,000 Words"", I never truly understood it until I saw the Santa Claus prints by Tom Browning. Every one of his prints tells a fantastic Christmas story. Santa's Workshop does exactly that. When you look at his prints, you are captivated by all the wonderful details that each one of his prints contains. I promise you, that if you purchase just one of Tom Browing's, Santa Claus prints, you will want to purchase more."
4,a phenomenal poet,"Li-Young Lee's latest collection once again shows what a phenomenal poet he is. While not quite as good as his first collection, _Rose_ (which is one of the better first books i've seen), it comes close. Lee has a lyricism and depth that continues to raise the bar for contemporary poets. The central theme of the mythic-hero father that was in Lee's first collection does not dominate this latest collection. Instead, we have poems that try to understand origins from both the father and the mother. _Book of My Nights_ is another poetry collection that deserves to be on your shelf."
4,Required Reading,"I recently became an independent wine consultant with The Traveling Vineyard. In short, I conduct wine tastings in people's homes. Part of the training for this position was reading this book. I highlighted, made note cards, and find myself constantly referring back to it. The best vintages for the varietals was by far, my favorite. But I have also used a lot of the facts to play trivia games at my wine tasting events. I would have liked less emphasis on French wines and more emphasis on American wines, but that is the only negative I can think of. Also, the food/wine pairings are really elaborate and I don't think most people would be found cooking these items up in their kitchen. But all in all, it was a great book to read to become familiar with the varieties and where they are grown. I just purchased a couple of books by Andrea Immer as I started watching her show and I'll be interested to compare the two styles. I'm sure I'll review her book here as well!"
3,excellent book ; piss-poor software,"The book is a classic in consulting. I purchased the ""toolkit"" thinking / hoping that the text would have been updated since it's 35mm slide days. It wasn't. My other hope was that the software would be something to really improve/ spice up the graphics of my presentations, which are largely based on Zelany's approach. It's not. The software is pretty much image files of the text's graphics which, as I mentioned above, haven't been updated since the Reagan administration."
3,"Book still great, toolkit lame","The book is what I was looking for. I know Gene Zelazny's work, and I got wat I expected. The toolkit however is not very special. You have to install a not very user friendly application in which you can find most of the drawings of the book. In my experiency a simple google query brings you the same quality."
3,Not a bad price since it comes with a scsi card.,"I've seen prices for this unit at $279, without the SCSI card. So this looks ok if you need both the card and the drive. For me, I don't need the card, so it is over priced."
1,What can I say..............,"I bought this movie because it said that it starred Morgan Freeman(one of my favorite actors). This has got to be one of the worst low budget films I've seen to date. But thats not my problem, my problem with this movie is to portray Morgan Freeman as a lead character when he only had 4 lines in the whole movie."
1,oh.............!,"terrible......bad, bad, who made this movie dont feel shame.Morgan Freeman appears two minutes at the begining and another two minutes at the end (without talking) M.Freeman works four minutes.The movie is 80' long. The first 10'with credits......the last 10' with credits. The movie is at least one hour long.I have loose one hour of my my life.Excuse my english, I speak spanish."
1,Don't waste your cash,"WORST MOVIE EVER! ""Guilty By Association"" (2003) Staring Morgan Freeman..... for 5 minutes!I've never felt more ripped off by a movie. They made this piece of ____ on tape out to be a Morgan Freeman crime thriller and it turned out to be another reason why rappers are the lowest rung on the evolutionary ladder."
1,I Feel Guilty Just For Having Watched It,"Wow. When I rented this movie, I knew that it might be bad, but I never expected a train wreck like this. It's not so much that the script was boring, but the way the movie was executed was somewhat bizarre. People's behavior (the police in particular) just didn't make much sense. I expected a certain level of quality given that the movie included Morgan Freeman, but I was unpleasantly surprised. His character wasn't particularly interesting or important. I have a suspicion that in the original script, Lieutenant Redding was a very minor character, but when they landed Morgan Freeman the Lieutenant was given more face time, though no more relevance. If you watch the trailer, it appears that the movie is centered on him. As it turns out, the plot and outcome of the movie would be the same if his character had never existed."
1,why did they bother?,"Where to begin! This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot. At least with most bad movies, you can usually tell there was some effort put into it. Not here. It seemed in some scenes that the actors blew their lines, so rather than re-shoot the scene, they over-dubbed it. And not very well. This was just a weak effort.The 'acting' in this movie was so bad it made the acting in 2 Fast 2 Furious seem oscar worthy. This piece of work was just a cliche--kind of a synthesis of all the bad Boyz N the Hood and Menace II Society knock-offs that have been made over the years.I wouldn't normally write reviews, but I felt I had to do my part to warn everybody about this movie..."
1,Just plain bad,"This movie was nothing like what was shown in the trailer, or what was desscibed on the back of the DVD case... if this wasnt a free rental from blockbuster, id be pissed off..."
1,really really bad,"I really felt like a sucker when I rented this a few months ago... saw Freeman on the cover, figured this was another of his great thriller cop movies. I watched it all the way to the end, and now I'm pondering what I could have done with those two hours of my life that are gone forever. What a terrible amateur movie.Like another reviewer said, Freeman just went waaaaay down in my list for associating with this movie in the first place."
1,Worst Movie EVER!!!!,"I rented this movie under the pretense that Morgan Freeman would have more than 12 words of dialogue. This was utter GARBAGE! DO NOT WATCH, RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE!!!"
1,One of the Worst,This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Morgan Freeman is one of my most favorite actors. I bought this DVD because his name was one it. He should be ashamed of himself. People have produce home videos that are better than this one.
3,HOW THE HELL DID MORGAN FREEMAN LAND IN THIS MOVIE?,"TWO FRIENDS ARE DRUG DEALERS IN WASHINGTON DC. WHEN ONE OF THEM SNITCHES ON THE OTHER, A STREET WAR STARTS. SHOCKINGLY, THE CREW OF THIS HOOD MOVIE HAPPENED TO GET MORGAN FREEMAN TO APPEAR IN THIS MOVIE. MORGAN FREEMAN, WHO IS BY FAR THE BEST ACTOR IN THE CAST, ACTUALLY HAS A SMALL ROLE. ALL HE DOES IS NARRATE, AND HE DOESN'T APPEAR UNTIL THE LAST 35 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE. THE FILM IS A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT THE REST OF Y'ALL SAY IT IS. IT HAS ENOUGH GOOD ACTING AND ENOUGH GOOD SCENES TO MAKE THIS RATE AS AN ACCEPTABLE MOVIE. IT'S DEFINITELY A NOTCH ABOVE A LOT OF THE OTHER HOOD MOVIES THAT'VE CAME OUT IN RECENT YEARS."
3,A little disappointed..,"I heard ""Permanent"" and liked the song so I bought the cd. I found it very repetitive, and I still have a hard time figuring out what song I'm listening to in the middle of a verse. I think these guys have potential, but I don't recommend this cd."
5,More Enjoyable than Average Folk Mujsic Transcriptions,"This dual disk collection of Franz Liszt's 'Magyar Dalok & Magyar Rapszodiak' (Hungarian Folk Music) is half again more enjoyable than many of the other issues in Leslie Howard's 'Complete Piano Music of Liszt' series. And, it is more enjoyable by half than many other composers' renditions of Mitteleuropean folk tunes. I'm thinking especially of those from Bartok and Kolodny. Liszt does not loose ALL of the life from these rustic tunes, and demonstrates how almost all classical music arose from humble roots (at least those which did not originate from liturgical practice.An enjoyable listen for the amateur musical gourmet."
4,Cute and classy toy,My daughter loves this and runs it around the house alot she is 19 months now and its been pretty popular for about 4 months. The string should be longer thats my only negative
4,No Shawnae Jebbia,"Even though Shawnae Jebbia is featured on the cover, she does not appear in the program. All is not lost, however, since Jennifer Dempster is in almost every scene. And the cover is awesome."
5,"Best CD Of 2004, BAR NONE!","The guy in Missouri simply must be tone-deaf, or legally, an idiot. In which case, I hope he is getting the services he needs. There is not a bad song on this entire disc, and the guitar work, song structures, and vocals are stellar throughout. If you like your smokin' Hendrix, SRV, Trower, & Cream, mixed with a little dash of Earth, Wind & Fire, funkified with some gooey 70's urban gravy, and heavied up a la King's X, then this completely original artist is for you. ""Alone In Love"", ""Didja"", and ""Cardboard Sign"" should have you bouncing off the walls, while the blues ditty, ""Quarter, Nickel, Or A Dime"" is so tasty it hurts, with Lance imitating Howlin' Wolf and Eric Gales channeling John Lee Hooker. A great cover of ""Spanish Castle Magic"", and the surprise appearance of Doug Pinnick on the epic ""Time"" also add to the worthiness of the CD. BUY AT ALL COSTS! This disc will rule your player for months."
2,dont get the game,At first the game may be fun but it only has four tracks and has only four racers. it gets really old really fast. the graphics are okay but nothing to get worked up about.
3,50/50 satisfaction....,"I purchased two of this product, it's been about 5 months since i purchased them & i barely have used any of it. A little defiantly goes a long way! I use it after i get out of the shower because my face always dries up. It's great for during the winter time, I've found that it's such a rich product that you need to pat it on your face then massage into skin. too much will defiantly make you feel oily. I don't recommend this during the summer time AT ALL. I wouldn't buy this product again, and I'd only recommend to a select few who have severely dry skin."
4,pleasant listening,"Four stars for Steven Coombs's performances of music that is pleasant, well-wrought, but finally not memorable. It might sound cruel to say, but I found Coombs's program notes in the booklet almost more interesting than the concertos themselves. I didn't know that Hahn was a pupil of Massenet at the Paris Conservatoire. Nonetheless, Hyperion is to be commended for this series, ""The Romantic Piano Concertos."" They are well-produced, well-played, and well recorded, and they provide a valuable context against which to hear works of more distinction -- the Saint Saens concertos, the Tchaikovsky concertos, the Grieg and Schumann, for example. On this recording I enjoyed the second and third movements of the Massenet and the improvisitory opening movement of the Hahn. But I miss the lack of interesting development of solo and orchestral material that one gets in Brahms and Schumann, for example."
1,Great show but WARNING about DVD,"I love this show; it is clever, witty and a superbly crafted drama. Was very happy to see it on DVD with extras.HOWEVER be warned; the commentary contains spoilers! Imagine watching it with my partner, who is seeing it for the first time, only to hear the writer commentary drop the details of the ""Nancy storyline"" (so as not to spoil it futher) in an early episode of the season!!They really should have taken more care.Oh, and the sequencing of the second episode is completely wrong: they show part 1, 3, 2 then poart 4 so it really doesn't make sense!Sadly, very poor quality control for a great show."
1,Ugh!,Elliot & Michael constantly playing games in their office...& then wondering why their business failed.Unwatchable.
3,Almost a great costume,"I ordered this costume, which arrived in plenty of time for Halloween. Almost every part of the costume looked terrific. The robe was breathable, which made it surprisingly cool to wear, the gloves and mask were in great shape and, after a little confusion on the velcro, the shawl and hood completed the look. The only problem I had- and it's a big one- was with the wings. They were of extremely poor quality (they look and feel like they're made of construction paper), they were fixed in an awkward pose and could not be moved easily and they looked extremely cheap compared to the rest of the costume. This could be a great grim reaper costume by itself, but the whole reason I bought it was for the effect of the wings. Even though they look extremely cool in the sample picture, they look terrible in real life. $50 is a lot of money to pay if you're not going to be able to use the wings, especially when there are so many cheaper grim reaper costumes out there."
2,Hard to use,"This product is what I expected, because I wasn't expecting much. It is hard to use, hard to punch through an ID badge that is the thickness of a normal credit card. Also, the machine pressed metal parts, including the metal of the main punch, are ragged and not finished well. Punching cards will sharpen the punch metal, but I wasn't expecting a metal item to leave a factory looking this ragged."
4,Great,Purchased for work and it works great on all of our badges. Would recommend for anyone needing to punch a hole in a badge.
5,First Edition,This book is found in university libraries throughout this country. It is a first-hand account of pioneering in the Indian Territories by a strong willed woman and her family. Killing snakes around the cabin was a weekly pastime to keep the little children safe.
1,Suspiciously over-rated...,"...If you like predictable, slow paced cliché riddled gay literature then this is the book for you. If not then save your time and money.As soon as The Lodger arrives on the scene then the ultimate ending is not too hard to work out, but takes a long time to arrive. My biggest problem with this book was my dislike for Honza the main character. Why someone who is so self possessed, shallow and vain is so well liked by family, neighbours, shopkeepers and the local drag queen did not make sense. Also irritating was the nephews incessant addressing Honza as Uncle. This is all dished up against the usual background of Steps, drugs and sex in toilets.I was looking forward to this book but was sadly disappointed."
4,Better than you'd think,"A series of vignettes that look at intercourse involved in intercourse. The most touching of which is the hook-up of ex'es. Their verbal and physical byplay show that they would both prefer to get back together, but neither has the courage to express the obvious truth. The ending of this single story moved me the most."
5,Hilarious!!!,"This was such a great movie. So funny, and so honest. It has the funniest line I've ever heard in any movie. Ever. Everyone I've shown this movie to has loved it. Buy it now!"
3,Only in Canada...,"It must be some kind of accomplishment to make a movie with this title that co-stars Carly Pope, Diora Baird, and Sonya Bennett almost preternaturally boring, but WHAT KIND of accomplishment I've no idea. Also, when an actress insists on wearing her bra during her would be sex scenes you have to wonder what she thought she signed up for, or what the director was thinking when he let her get away with it. Maybe they both thought she was back doing kiddie parties pretending to be Dora the Explorer."
5,Interesting take on sex,"This movie doesn't pretend to be anything other than a glimpse of ""the game"" that so many young people take part in, all for the sake of sex and/or not being alone.It's an excellent watch, and shows some of the intricacies of ""the game"" as well as potential situations that can happen when you mix fire and ice, so to speak.Not for kids!"
3,Kids are creatures of habit,"Although I must say my children, for the most part, have liked these videos, and this one has been quite handy at bedtime, I do take on a few issues.I agree with the reviewer that said the dragon, etc. puppetry was scary to sensitive children, although I have felt it more with Baby Bach.Second,I agree with the reviewer that this video will not help your child become smarter, or develop a true ear.But, mostly I agree with the reviewer that says ""don't be fooled"" because you are setting them up to embrace total commercialism--plastic, non interactive toys and tinny music.I am not totally opposed to this video, in fact at times its been a real lifesaver. But I do believe that it should not become a staple in a baby's daily experience. The better one to by would be Baby Van Gogh if you want one."
2,BABY WAS NOT INTERESTED,"I thought the set of videos was a good idea, but I really bought them b/c of the other reviews. My 1 year was not at all interested in these, in fact I think they put her to sleep. The videos are nothing but toys moving around and classical music. I did enjoy hearing the music, however my little girl says she likes Barney & The Wiggles much better. Buy it if you want to buy them anyway... But be prepared that your child may be bored, if your child has ever watched Barney or The Wiggles or The Teletubbies, they won't give these movies a second glance. I give these movies the BIG thumbs down."
2,Base on my babies reaction.........,I bought the 5 baby einstein videos when my son was 6 month old. I let him watch each tape a day to see his response. He finds Baby Einstein and Baby Mozart boring. He cannot sit the whole time. But with baby shakespeare and baby van gogh his eyes did not blink of moved. I think this two videos are more exciting than the first two. The first two videos lack colors and exciting movements to attrack him. Now he is 1 year old and he still loves the two videos. He still find baby shakespear and baby van gogh exciting
2,Mozart didn't have Baby Mozart!,"I watched this at a friend's house with her baby and my baby (7 months old). He is not interested in TV (he never was), he would rather watch what's going on around him. Her child seemed to be mesmerized by this, but is this a good thing? Anyway, it less expensive and probably better for motor skills just to put on a classical record/CD and let your child play while listening to music. Anyway, what's next Baby Shakespeare?!"
5,Excellent video for baby & toddlers!,"My little boy has been watching this video since he was 6 weeks old sitting in his bouncer. He would just stare at it, glued to it. Now at 16 months he still loves it, laughs with it, and claps at the end. It has beautiful shapes, classical music, toys and objects of all colors. I highly recommend this for babies and toddlers."
5,"My triplets Joey, Sarah, and Jillian love this tape!!!",I have 5 month old triplets and they started watching this tape about three months ago. They love this tape! Nothing keeps their attention better. It is wonderful 25 minutes of peice. I think anyone with a baby should own this tape.
1,Don't be fooled ! - Think twice,"I know that Baby Mozart and Einstein have been very popular and I even have them in our home, but now I know better! ...The BRAINY BABY videos are FAR better for the same price (in fact the Brainy Baby videos are 45 minutes, instead of the 25 minutes you get with Mozart). ...!If your child watches Brainy Baby, they actually LEARN their ABC's, 123's, Colors, etc. as well as being entertained with BEAUTIFUL images! I say buy these types of videos for your children, (Right Brain and ABC's are our favorites) but if you want your child to become smarter as well as be entertained with beautiful and creative images, then [choose]Brainy Baby. You won't be disappointed and you'll get a well deserved 45 minute break!"
1,Baby Mozart,"I like the idea of these videos, however the quality is awful. We bought a boxed set at Christmas for our baby. The sound quality is absolutely horrific, being one who enjoys classical music this tape just beats it to death, the recording is choppy and it skips notes. When buying something mainly for the purpose of exposing my children to classical music I am really saddened that at times I feel this video is better viewed with the volume off.The video quality is not that great either the tapes are already starting to flip after just 5-6 viewings.Like I said the idea of the project is very creative, but you could probably create a better video at home with you own video camera."
3,Pain in the neck,"We own 4 of these DVDs, and the content is great, but there are a rediculous amount of commercials at the beginning that cannot be skipped. Spare us the garbage, please!"
2,Freaky Puppets,"Some of the video was cute, but the puppets scared my daughter, and I have to say, they freaked me out a bit too."
3,"Good but my child prefers ""SINGING BABIES""","I have a seven-month-old boy who, like his siblings, enjoys Baby Mozart. However, nothing gets him going like ""SINGING BABIES NURSERY RHYME TIME"" and ""SINGING BABIES TODDLER TUNES."" These two videos command his undivided attention in a way that nothing else can. And I mean nothing! He vocalizes sounds...trying to imitate the babies that appear to sing in the video. It is amazing to watch. That is why I would recommend Baby Mozart as good infant stimulation, but SINGING BABIES makes my boy not just an idle watcher but a real participant."
3,It amzes me that this video gets so many rave reviews,"I give three stars only because it does come in handy if you need to occupy your infant for thirty minutes, and the video is at least age appropriate for infants...I would much rather have a one year old watch this than a faster paced cartoon. We received this video, Baby Einstein and Baby Bach as a gift and I was not impressed with any of them, although, as I said, they did once in a while come in handy. I do highly recommend some of the newer BE series videos...we got Baby Van Gogh and Baby Doolittle Neighborhood Animals when my daughter was a baby and they are so much better because they use puppets and have a theme and some structure. I never understood the ""video board book"" concpet of watching the video as an activity with your child...I much preferred looking at picture books when my children were infants."
5,The best video!,"My son is 4 months old & he loves this video. He ""talks"" & laughs while watching this video. Every morning, I put him in his bouncey seat & put in the video & it gives me a 1/2 hour to get ready ....My husband & I also have watched the video & it really is very good....I would defiently put it on a baby registry!!"
5,Great for self entertainment!,"My daughter has loved this video since she was one month old!! She is totally entertained the ENTIRE time it is on, and has not once cried or become bored while watching it! She is now almost four months and watches it every morning while I'm in the shower and getting ready for our day!! It was on of the most valuable things I received at my baby shower!"
1,good idea but boring and non educational,"I think that this video is a good idea. It just doesn't hold the attention of my baby, nor does it provide my baby with much information that he can process. I give credit to the producers for trying something new at the time, but nowadays there is much better in the way of video for infants...."
3,For babies under 18 months,"I bought this video for my 20 month old because of the great success we had with the Baby Newton video. However, the Baby Mozart video is clearly targeting younger kids than the Baby Newton Video. For example, it shows a hand slowly putting rings on a peg like it is difficult(something 18 months old can do with ease). It shows prolonged shots of drops falling and balls turning and stills of fruit, that would be interesting to a child trapped in a swing but not to an active 20 month old. For older toddlers, get Baby Newton. It is fast-paced, full of things that are fun to learn the names of (jelly-fish, checkered flag, suitcase), and interesting for adults and toddlers to watch together."
5,A must-have!,"The ""Baby"" videos are wonderful, they allowed my daughter to wind down after an hour of hard play. This video captivated both my kids from the first showing. It is an educational video if you get involved, as recommended by Julie Aigner-Clark. She emphasizes watching WITH your child and naming the objects on the screen, not using it as an electronic babysitter (although it's great when you need to cook dinner!). We wore out the Baby Einstein tape and still are watching the others--we have almost the whole series. Baby Mozart is my standard gift to new mothers-to-be."
2,May be a bit much for your baby,"While I do not disagree that this is a good video, I want to point out that if you have an easily excited baby, this may not be a good choice for your baby. My baby is 5 months old and since she was 3 months she has occasionally watched bits of the video (we are still not through the whole video). She watches it very intently for a few minutes and then starts screaming and crying! After she sees the video she is so would up that she falls apart at the littlest thing for the next 3 days! She is much happier if I let her watch airplanes on TV with the music on instead."
1,what is this?!,"I'm sorry but this is nonsense. I feel terrible for those who think these videos are ""educational"" as there is nothing useful, educational, or related to mental development in these silly videos. How come people feel better just because the title says Einstein and Mozart? Videos are not even pretty, they could get my son's attention for a minute or so. By the way, I would suggest J. Medina's ""Brain Rules"", he clearly explains how Disney had to remove the word ""educational"" from the product description."
5,baby is mezmerized,our 6 month old and our 2 1/2 year old LOVE this dvd. they are both mesmerized by it and the music is great. I find myself humming to mozart some days. very soothing dvd.
3,Pleased,Decent content. My baby gets bored with it after about 15 minutes. YouTube has all videos online though so I wont be buying more.
5,The Best for Babies,"As a nanny, I started showing my charge the Baby Mozart video from the time she was 4 months old. Now as an expectnant mother, I know that I will start my own baby on this video, because I've seen the dramatic results it produces. My former charge, now 16 months old, recognizes Mozart's works upon hearing the first few notes (in a store, on the the radio, etc.) and I fully believe it helped her capacity of learning grow tremendously. I'm excited to show this video to my baby one day soon!"
5,Excellent,My 6 month old loves this video. It makes for a peaceful dinner. Even my 3 year old enjoys watching it. It's very entertaining.
5,My grandson's favorite!,"My daughter received the video for a shower gift. My grandson, who is now 4 1/2 months old has been watching it since he was 1 month. He loves it. It soothes him when he's cranky and even helps his digestion. I enjoy watching it with him and I always tell him the names or colors that are on the screen."
1,Very Disappointing: A How to Watch TV Video,"After hearing so many parents raving about this series I was very disappointed when I tried both Baby Mozart and Baby Bach out with my infant son. My expectations--of stimulating, beautiful music with amazing graphics--may have been too high, but I wasn't prepared for what is simply a video of toys accompanied by cheesy synthesized muzak, punctuated with random appearences by the creator's children, Sierra and (I'm not making this up) Aspen. I felt I was just teaching my son how to watch TV. He wasn't interested; even if he were, I don't think watching these images would do him much good. A strangely dispiriting experience. Buy a big red ball instead, and bounce it on the floor."
2,Good - but....,There is one major flaw with this product. The music is wonderful and well produced. It is gentle and soothing to match the simple (yet perfectly hypnotizing to your little guy or gal). The problem is that in two different sections (the music stops) and a hand puppet and giant spider on a string jump out and make a HUGE SCARRY NOISE! They scare the living daylights out of my child and make him physically jump and cry. If it wasn't for those two sections - I would reccommend the product. But - in reality - I cannot.
5,A Great Find!,"This is a great video for parent child interaction. I talk with my 2 month old about the images that come up. He shows his excitement by wiggling his legs and arms as well as ""talking"" as he watches. As an elementary educator, I recommend the video because it incorporates the visual with auditory in a unique yet simple way for young children."
5,THIS VIDEO IS THE BEST $15.00 I'VE EVER SPENT!,"My son is almost three months old and he absolutely loves this video. He is a very sweet baby and I have no complaints, but it's been hard to get him to play with toys and I noticed him watching the TV so I figured why not put something on he might like. I know three other people with babies and they swear by this video, and now so do I!! It gives me thirty minutes to do whatever I want and gives him more interest in toys. This is the best $15.00 I've ever spent !!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,If you only buy one thing buy any of these videos.,This has been the only way to calm down my son from the time he was just 3 weeks old. He is now 16 months old and still loves the videos. I am not a big advocate of sticking children in front of the television but these videos are great not only to calm down a baby or toddler but to get some saniety back into mom and dads heads. Some of my friends with children the same age did not have children as intrested in it but my son loves it. I have found that boys usually like it better than girls.
3,I Agree With Topeka,"Baby Mozart is a bit young for my two year old. So, on Topeka, KA recommendation, I tried Let's Talk With Puppy Dog All About Shapes. My son can't get enough. He makes the shapes with his hands and really participates. Baby Mozart is good for the baby crowd, but think again for two and up. Thanks Topeka!"
3,so so,"My son has other one's of these and this one is short, and not as good. Just more boring, and he seems less interested than the Baby Einstein baby bach."
5,wonderful!,"Our baby has been hypnotized by this video from 3 months old and still loves it a 17 months. As she's gotten older she also LOVES Baby McDonald and Favorite Place. Some of the other Baby Einstein are less facinating, but these are great teachers and extremely entertaining for our (VERY verbal) girl."
5,Buy this video today!,Baby Mozart is wonderful. The music is great and the images keep my daughter interested through out the entire tape. A must have.
2,Howlin' Buddha,"Mediocre at best. Same over and over again, pretty typical mid-level blues talent. disappointing purchase. Perhaps other albums are better, but not interested enough now."
3,So-so,I put the book down in the first quarter to go back to the Thai detective. Perhaps it's the Old World that was getting me bored.
5,Tamara Hayle is an Ace,"Tamara Hayle is a single mother and private investigator. She left the police force to pursue this career challenge.In this novel, Tamara investigates the mysterious deaths of a group of young men. These young men are being murdered, one by one with no apparent justification. The one commonality is that these young men have the same father, who also happens to be the father of Tamara's son. She wants to find out what is going on before Tragedy hits home.This investigation gives you a look at Tamara the PI, Tamara the mother, and Tamara the woman. It shows her relationships with the men in her life: her brother Johnny, her son, his father (DeWayne), her former co-workers, and they mysterious Basil Dupree. Tamara Hayle is an ace P.I. I never wanted to read mysteries, so this was bought on a whim. Valerie Wilson Wesley has done a great job with this character. I've gotten every Tamara Hayle Mystery since I read this one, although this one is still my favorite."
2,"Good Characters, Bad Mystery","I always like to give new authors a chance, so I read ""When Death Comes Stealing"" hoping for a good mystery. What I got were 2 characters that I liked a lot, Tamara and Jamal, but very little actual detection from a supposed private eye. Try Marcia Muller or Sue Grafton if you want good mystery and detection from a female writer. I will probably not read another of Wesley's books. I love mysteries, and mysteries without plot are no good."
5,A book you could read in 1 day!,The book was EXCELLENT! You won't want to put this book down! Each chapter leads right into the next! Once you start reading this book you immediately want to read how it ends!
4,PACKED WITH EXCITEMENT,FAST PACED AND KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE YOU YOURSEAT. TAMARA IS A BLACK LIBERATED WOMAN WHO LOVES TO SOLVE MYSTERIES. HER EX'S SONS ARE DROPPING LIKE FLIES AND WHO IS KILLING THEM?? HER OWN SON MIGHT BE NEXT AND SHE HAS TO STOP THE KILLER BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
1,false advertisement,The company gave false advertisement. They had an older edition listed under a newer one. They try to make it your fault once you complain. The title doesn't list which copy but only comes up under the newer listing.
1,Never received book,I waited a month and never received my book. I was refunded for it. I will not buy through this seller again.
3,Horrible Number of Errors,"It is simply unacceptable for a book to be on its fourth edition and have so many errors.The font for the book is too small and the layout of illustrations seems disconnected from the content. The author clearly knows the topic and seems to have taught it for a very long time. The content is very current, covering contemporary Intel designs.I believe that this text is a favorite among professors because it comes with Powerpoint templates. Always a winner for the professors, not necessarily for the students considering that they too suffer from a lack of copy and image proofing."
3,"Ok book, but is confusing","The book at least for the first three chapters, provides little help to the understanding of the basics of computer hardware, I know there has to be a better book than this."
1,Wrong gaskets!,"The item came packaged with the wrong gaskets. Not all of the gaskets were the wrong ones, but the moment I opened the box, it was clearly evident the valvew cover gaskets were the wrong ones.... And the packaging the gaskets come in is what they are shipped in. DOES NOT SURIVIVE UPS!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great Value if you didn't buy them years ago,I personally really hate it when people cry about how it sucks for a book to be reprinted but fails to realize that it is great that the books have gained popularity again.
5,She made me cry again....,"As with most of Sarah's music, this song took a few replays to grow on me. I bought the single, simply because it was hers, and I knew I'd like it eventually, and then forgot about it for several days. When I realized that I was hearing it on the radio and she'd perfectly captured an emotion I couldn't even define, it found it's way into my CD player and hasn't left since. I often find myself wondering if she's really singing to or about the woman the lyrics would imply, and that makes the song even more meaningful to me...because the words and feelings she conveys with her music and that haunting voice could be for anyone. Well worth the price of admission."
5,This is the best song I have heard in a long time.,Sarah is a very talented singer and I believe this is just a taste of her incredible voice.
2,"Sorry, ""Killer""","This music hasn't aged as well as I thought it would. 'knocked a star off because it's mastered from an LP & there's a skip. The included dub for Mix Up Moods, titled here ""Russian Invasion"", is very hip, though."
4,Fun to be Silly,Good thing this is a fun CD to listen to... my granddaughter listens to it over and over again... and we all enjoy it! A nice selection of familiar easy to sing songs.
1,NOT FOR MY CHILDREN,Wow... since when did Jesus become a capitalist?This gift went straight to the trash.sorry :-)
3,"The good, the bad and... oh, album's done.","I love Mogwai and have done so for a while. This album is good but by no means stellar. It is not a five star album as some others would have you believe. Here's a track by track: Sine Wave: Fantastic! Creating propulsive atmosphere like this should be a crime. Take me somewhere nice: Well done, but Stuart, please keep your voice to yourself. O, I sleep: GARBAGE. Dial:Revenge: musically fantastic, not a big fan of Welsh vocals. You don't know Jesus: reminiscent of past Mogwai but not as good. Robot Chant: RUBBISH. 2 rights make 1 wrong: Album's best track, excellent. Secret Pint: so so. So there you have it: an OK album from an amazing band."
4,Mogwai at his worst is still a great band,"Rock action is far away from more of the recent post-rock albums. Mogwai is wonderful creator, in that it tries to make its sound evolving. The fear and shivering that I couldfelt for both ""Young Team"" and ""C.O.D.Y."", was not here for this LP. Why? Because there is no more beautiful violence. There are these attempts to escape, these attempts to discover fields of dreams. But, they let us with that impression that mogwai had left its magic. rock action is shorter, sadder and less creative. However, such songs as ""two wrongs.."" or ""Secret Pint"" are purely magnificient. A kind of dissapointment as I was expected far more from this unique band, but it is still a very good album that you have to acquire."
5,Just a thought...,"You can read my review below but I thought that I should add that Mogwai is most definetly NOT a british band (As some people have said). They are from Glasgow, Scotland. Just thought i ought to mention it!-Ethan Lewis"
3,"pretty good, but not their best","This release has some nice instrumentals. A bit more subdued than previous releases, but still pretty good. They're a bit more melancholy.This ""full length"" CD is under 40 minutes. That took away a star. The only thing ""full length"" about it is the price. I didn't like that."
5,Ahhhhhhhhh...,"For some real pleasure listen to ""Sine Wave,"" or the whole album for that matter, but especially ""Sine Wave"" while making-out or other sexual goings-on."
2,"The original work gets a five, the censorship does not.","I was reading this at the bookstore when, lo-and-behold, the images were censored. Any kind of censorship is not worth the money they ask for. I rather go to Kinokuniya and buy the Japanese tankobon of this work. I really hope this is not a trend with North American translators to ruin someone else's work with censorship. At the very least, the cover should let one know if the work has been ruined this way so that buyers can make an informed decision whether to buy it or not. I thought it was cool to finally see a English translation, but I cannot bother with this version."
5,"Censored, but good !!!","This is my first manga& it's pretty good, irecommend it to who ever thinks they might be interested& for thecensorship the addition of a towel,or stars to cover nippels dosen't dramaticly affect the story& starting in volume 13 the censorshipstops."
3,"OK as comedy, awful as romance","I''s is not a bad little shounen comedy. It's well-drawn, features a bunch of funny twists and turns, and moves at a quick pace. The problem is that the comedy revolves around romance, a subject that Masakazu Katsura is completely incapable of portraying in any kind of convincing manner. The storyline and characters are simply too contrived and unrealistic to have anything whatsoever to say about real emotion: the love interest is a fashion model in high school, for god's sake (or is it junior high?), and the plot revolves around everyone's attempts to peak at her (...)Older readers looking for a little more depth will probably not be satisfied by I''s (try Kare Kano, instead), but it's not bad for what it is: a simple, entertaining read for boys."
5,THE GREATEST WASHING MACHINE,"Before I had this washing machine, I had another one.This one is better than my old one."
2,"Breaks after a year, starts leaking and malfunctioning.","Avanti W797 is wonderful basic machine as long as it works ok. I had made basic fixes ""duct tape"" to stop several leaks within first 2 months. After a year it had developed a major leak and ruined my kitchen floor. Avanti Customer service was unresponsive as other users have described. Would not recommend to anyone. $300 is a little too much for an appliance which lasts a year."
1,Unreliable manufacturer,"Seems one should stay away from Avanti washers. Break very easily. Mine lasted for a few months of very light use, and it broke anyway.Very dissapointed ...."
4,I had my Avanti W797 since april 2008 just broke fri 11.23.2012,I loved this washer seems like the touch panel when the water level botton wont work so because I had the machine so long an it worked so good I when and brought another local appliance store $400.00 they deliver the new one take the old one and I will have it mon.I had whirlpool and it only last 6 yrs so now this Avanti almost 5 so I guess you get your money's worth cause the whirlpool had a leak and that was it and this Avanti I knew when I saw the touch pad I knew it wasnt going to last for long.The machine looks like new shame to toss it!!!over something so small but knew it would cost to much to repair and waiting on a repair man I cant do and waiting for the pairs.
2,Nothing new,"Although most of this book was filled with useful parenting advice, it was fairly mainstream and none of it was new. Very little seemed solely applicable to boys and single moms. The last chapter was the most applicable, and that was because it was about finding time for yourself and how important that was, particularly for a single parent. On the whole, though, I would recommend any of the Sears' books, Penelope Leach's or Terry Brazelton's books. This one was ok, but since it billed itself as a book for single moms raising sons, I expected more about single moms and sons!"
1,"Long, boring and pathetic","Unfortunately, this is one of the worst pieces of literature I have ever read. To my surprise Gamboa falls into a boring an unnecessary overextended autobiography of his life in Paris and his experiences with other immigrants. It does depict a more obscure Paris, but it doesn't elucidate on anything new or alluring to the globalized culture of this century. His stream of consciousness becomes boring after the first 50 pages. For being such a famous writer, his style is too basic and relies too much on extremely detailed descriptive prose, delivering a novel very predictable for an amateur reader. The plot is spiced up by Paula's nymphomaniac practices that start to get boring by page 120.This is as bad as reading Marquez's ""Memorias de mis putas tristes"" with the difference that Marquez's novel is less painful to read just because is shorter."
4,Finally,"This is another great album from the early 90's by a true DIVA whose powerful voice handled uptempo songs as well as ballads. This album features good FUN music that can uplift my mood and take me back to the time when there was so much more variety in music.Favorite tracks to this day are: KEEP ON WALKIN, INSIDE THAT I CRIED, FINALLY (loved to roller skate to this track), LIFELINE, WE GOT A LOVE THANG, CRAZY LOVE & YOU WIN, I WIN, WE LOSE.At 10 tracks there are no filler tracks and at the great used prices, I'd recommend adding it to your collection (if you don't already have it)."
5,CD review,This is a replacement of many CD's that were stolen from my car. She is great!. Lots of energy in this album
2,The least helpful of middle school study skills books...,"I have now reviewed about ten books on middle school study skills, and there are others better than this one.This book is divided into three parts: (1) getting it together, (2) What's my grade?, and (3) learning to learn. Much of the book is direct at the teacher, who is urged to micro-plan his or her classroom experience, e.g., have pencil, pen, and paper, use homework helpers, getting set up for class, having a place to study, and so forth. Ernst then writes about grading systems (not sure what that has to do with study skills), and then, finally, addresses some specific study skills. The suggestions in the section ""Reading This and That"" seemed fairly elementary to me, and were not, in fact, process skills that students could use.I found Laurie Rozakis' book Super Study Skills to be more useful in this age group. William Luckie's book Study Power is more useful in the high school and early college age group."
4,Great use for the classroom or Advisory group.,I used this with my advisory group. I was the adviser for a group of 5th grade students and it was a great way to prepare them for organizing themselves for the work load in middle level.
5,Please correct the rating of my review,"I'm the author of ""Middle School Study Skills."" The information I posted back in 2000 was not meant to be a review. However, it has since been categorized as a review with ZERO stars. As you can see, that brings the average down to 2.5 -- not too good. Please either make my entry information only, or -- if it has to be categorized as a review -- make it 5 stars. (I like my book.) Thanks."
1,Chips and cracks easily! Pfaltzgraff has poor customer service!,"Among the 12 salad plates, 12 dessert plates, 12 cereal bowls and 12 large coffee mugs I bought a few months ago, an annoying high percentage of them are now chipped and the coffee mugs cracked! I am careful with them, but it apparantly doesn't take much to chip any of them and have the mugs develop cracks from just normal use!I called Pfaltzgraff about my problems and they said they would only replace 3 salad plates. It has now been 6 months and I still have had no response from them as they promised me!Very disappointed!"
5,Powerful works -- stunning performance,"I bought this CD on a whim, not being familiar with much of Hovhaness' work other than ""Mysterious Mountain"". The real gem on this recording is the Starker performance of the Cello Concerto. There are few cellists around who can get such a powerful and dark sound out of the instrument as he does without sounding forced. The performance is emotionally compelling from the first bar to the last. A pleasant surprise for me was the Seattle Symphony which plays gorgeously in both the Cello Concerto and the Symphony No.22. The lower brass, in particular, display stunning ensemble playing and total security in intonation. Their interjections communicate nicely with the cello part in the Concerto. Altogether a highly recommendable disc."
1,the worst,This has to be one of the worst movies ever made . Even with fast forward it took to long . It was one of those movies that was made just to give people a job.
1,Don 't Even Bother With This One!!!,"Despite two fine actors (Christian Slater, Willian H Macy) in this film, the plot is pretty dumb and hard to figure out. Is this a comedy or a drama? There are a few good moments but most of the time I had to advance to the next chapter to get an idea of what is going on. This is a C movie at best. I suggest to rent it -- not buy it if you want to figure it out yourself. I rented it and I feel I threw away the money for the rental. Try something else--just not this movie."
3,Might be OK if you're in the mood,"Other reviewers have done a good job of reviewing the basic plot, so no need to go into that here. The reason I gave it so few stars is that the whole thing felt like slapstick comedy. It felt very plastic, very contrived. And, of course, the whole plot made no sense.*** SPOILER ALERT ****There are three endings. I suggest you watch the two alternate endings in the Extra Features section. Personally, I preferred the second alternate, it felt much more cohesive and integral to the film. Both alternate endings made it clear that the whole movie was a fantasy, and that's more what the movie felt like - like it was SUPPOSED to be a dream.With the ending it had, however, it just seems like a poorly-directed, internally-conflicted film with poor writing and some good actors in it."
3,Disturbing!,I found this story to be disturbing. One never knows what goes on in the mind of a quiet person.
5,Rich and Splendid,"This CD lived up spectacularly to expectations!!!! Magnificent singing, organ work and spacious sound! One couldn't, IMO, ask for better. This will be a welcome addition to a music collection for those who are immersed in music for organ and boys/mens choirs. Thanks to William O'Donnell and his singers!!!!"
5,Should be called the Coffee Table Encyclopedia of Gardening,"I am so impressed with this big, beautiful book! The photos are inspiring, and the technical aspects are thoroughly covered. I love the historic background of each vegetable and herb.I think there is literally everything I ever needed to know about vegetable gardening from seed germination, through care and feeding, to harvest. Detailed charts outline fertilizer, pests, water, soil conditions, and planting and harvest times.I keep it on my coffee table and flip through it daily just to enjoy the photos and learn some new fact.You will not be disappointed with this book!"
5,My favorite garden book,"I grow veggies and find that this is the book I reference most often. Not only do they explain how to sow, take care of and harvest various vegetables but they talk about all variations of the vegetable. Who ever heard of Egyptian walking onions until I read the book. Next year I'll plan some."
2,No attention to hardiness zones,"As a gardener who has moved a lot and now lives in a hardiness-zone 9b, I find this book utterly lacking. The only attention to hardiness zones is on page 430 where a hardiness-zone map has been reproduced on such a small scale one cannot even read the numbers. Skip this book. The rest of the material is not good enough to make up for this total lack of information."
5,The Island,Really enjoyed this film. Very moving! and of course had all the English subtitles...it's a really deep and meaningful film...
5,Superb -- and not for the faint of heart,"Those who see Beethoven as the great shining progressive of democracy may not realize he had an exceptionally bleak side. We find it in Coriolanus, one of his finest overtures (as performed by Karajan for DG), and we find it in these works, music of great mourning and passion. Here the classical music magazines' plaudits were quite justified; these are among Beethoven's earliest masterpieces, sung with a surpassing spirit of devotion. Albums like these have made Hyperion one of the greatest names in recorded music, and while it has been sad to hear of its legal woes (largely self-inflicted), its musical legacy will endure, and one hopes more new recordings will further burnish it."
5,Good Value!,"I have a hard time finding different size freestanding clear frames, so I went online and found them on Amazon. The packaging the frames come in is protective and the order came pretty quickly."
5,Ordered this as a gift.,Ordered this cd for my aunt and I received it on time and in excellent condition. I love Lee Williams but she kept talking about it and I ordered it for her. She LOVES it!!!
2,not what i expected,"its good gun oil, but it is in a can like wd 40 with a straw, i hate that!! i use it for a glock so i do not need to spraying the entire gun, just on rails and other small areas. i literately have to spray it in the trash so i can get the few drops on the tip of the straw on to my slide or spring. other than that, the oil seems to work great."
2,It's lube,"For me, I question having a gun oil in a compressed air container. A little messy to work with and you usually get more than you want to apply. As far as the the ""advanced"" gun oil content vs regular gun oil. If you take care of your firearms you'll probably never know or see the difference."
1,Bad customer service.,Never got this product and only remembered I ordered it when asked to review it. I contacted company and was told it had been too long to make a claim. Beware you may only get a bill and never any product. Amazon was NO help.
3,Lube,Seems to work OK. THE spray is a little messy to work with because of the limited amount of control you have over the volume of lubricant
3,Some hissing,"When I ran this audio cable along with a RGB cable from my laptop to my Vizio 50"" plasma, it generated intermittent hissing noises. It's only noticable during low noise scenes but it's there. A little more shielding on this audio cable would make this a better audio cable."
5,good buy,The product was exactly what I had purchased in the store and it was delivered as promised. I am very satisfied as a first time buyer from Amazon.com.
1,Not FORGOTTEN long enough.,"This is stretching credibility to get anywhere near 4 stars. These were not forgotten long enough. I don't care how much you appreciate old stuff, these simply SUCK wind. Do not waste your time. 100 thumbs DOWN."
2,"Far infeirior to Disney, Fleischer, Warner Bros. etc.","After reading all the glowing reviews here, I ordered Vol. 1 expecting quite a treat. I am a huge fan of classic animation, especially from the Fleischer Bros. Studio. I consider their Superman series (avoid the WinStar set) to be one of the greatest creative feats of American popular culture.After watching half of this DVD I've come to the conclusion that I never need to see any of these cartoons again. Perhaps they are interesting from a historical viewpoint, but they are not as entertaining as the product of the other major studios. Maybe I should watch the whole DVD, in case the second half is markedly superior to the first 16 cartoons, but I doubt it.If you do buy this set, don't be surprised when you come to the realization that they are nowhere near as good as the majority of reviews here imply. See if you can rent it first for a test drive, before spending ... on an item you'll probably watch just once."
1,Ub Iwerks is not Disney!,"There is a good reason why ""time forgot"" these cartoons - they are boring. Working for Disney does't qualify somebody as a genius, but mentioning the Master's name sells even these second class cartoons. Maybe they were not so bad for their time, but I was expecting much more."
4,Strange things going on...,"Some things I was familiar with, but then I read some strange things going on in the back woods of Georgia. Odd that these things were accepted by the people of said woods, thinking that God accepts them as well in spite of the Bible saying otherwise.The book is okay though and if you want a laugh or two, then buy it. Other than that, don't bother. The history of the people is good, too."
1,Waste of my money,"This was a waste of money, all the video was on the 2 disc set that came out and fifty [stinks] live. The 3 tracks were the worst ever. This I can tell you is [bad]. DO NOT BUY THIS ...!"
5,thats the sound of the man clappin that thing,a great documentry on 50....It shows you how nice rappers kan be
4,O.K.,"This DVD is a good DVD except for one reason, a great deal of the footage is repeated from the first DVD that originaly came with the ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" album. Not all footage is repeated there is alot of cool things on this DVD like Live footage of 50, eminem, D12, and obie trice from Detroit. Good quality, loads of extras, and all in all pretty Good."
3,Okay but not the best,"I thought the documentaries were gonna be longer. Both of them combined did not exceed more then mabye a half an hour. The dvd is filled up by live performances and videos. The only new video is the one for heat, which is hot. The bonus cd is pathetic. It only has 3 songs on it. Come on, that's not even worthy of an EP let alone an LP. The only song I did like was In Da Hood. If you want a really good hip hop dvd, get Rewind: Hip-Hop Dvd Magazine 1. I have seen better free dvds that come free with the cd than The New Breed. I mean, the dvd is alright, but its not the best."
4,new breed 3-track,"I don't like 50 cent that much, but I gotta just comment on that track ""In Da Hood (feat. Brooklyn)"". That's one of the best tracks I've heard this year (yeah yeah its like 2 minutes, but man, that track is banging) other than Sincere's ""What"" song. [In Da Hood got a] Perfect beat, lyrics, vocals and everything. that girl Brooklyn I wanna hear more of. The other two tracks I've heard some of and I'm not really feelin that much but I dunno, I just wanted to say that I'd buy this cd thing for that song right there, even if I'm dirt poor as i am heheh."
4,Does what it's supposed to do!,"I have one of the microphones and I can honestly say it's a great product! The sound quality is nice and clear! On a scale of 1 to 10 on sound quality, it's probably about an 8. Not bad at all for an <$10 mic!"
1,Truth,"I don't think Islam is Tolerant and Peace loving, If so, How come There are no freedom to practise othe Religions like Hinduism, Buddhism and Chritianity. WHy there are no freedom of speech and why ther are no democracies? There is not a single country which is elected democratically."
1,Another ideology whose deeds don't match the words,"Islamic principles and beliefs-monotheism, peace, charity, compassion, interfaith tolerance, women's rights.Deeds committed in the name of Islam - mass murder, war, hatred, intolerance, treating women like property.I don't want to single out Islam here. Christianity has its own sad history. There are many ideologies religious and political that preach goodwill towards mankind but have been platforms for evil doing. For those who believe that results matter more than teaching I ask you to consider the following: What good is any set of principals and beliefs if they are used for evil purposes. We would all be better off as atheists who treat each other with respect and dignity."
1,Never gets around to mentioning the anti-woman hadith,"As the author will knows, the Hadith, are the second set of sacred writings in Islam. The Hadith contain sayings of Mohammed and anecdotes from his personal history. The Hadith are filled with unambiguously anti-female statements. Mohammed directly and unambiguously is quoted as saying that women are deficient in intellect. Few non-Muslims have any knowledge of this literature so it is easy for them to be misled. 500 million Muslim men have been raised to believe that God likes them better and they have been told by God to control women's lives. ..."
2,The great shame,"This trash book pretends it 'confronts' the 'false images' of Islam. But what false image are we talking about? The author claims that many Muslims, especially in America, have obtained high roles as politicans and business leaders and that theirfore the idea of Islamic terrorist is false. But the problem is that it is not false. The terrorists of Sept 11th really did live in America. They did train in America. They really did kill 3000 Americans. So this book should have been more honest in realizing their are many images of the Islamic faith from the ultra-orthodox to the religiously moderate to the apostate and the terrorist. This book is a shame."
1,False Security,"This book does not explain how an Imam from England can say,'If Allah tells me to condemn terrorism, I will condemn terrorism""!This book does not explain that while not all Muslims are terrorist, most terrorist are Muslims!This book truly is trying to lull Americans into a false since of Security."
1,Inferior Publication,"Another Islamic Puppet, a typical American ignorant, manipulated by Islamists and Muslims, who used by Muslims and criminals alike, forwards the Islamic heinous agenda against all infidels, in order to take over the western civilization, its culture and obviously financial assets.Another corrupted congressman or simply a poor thing who doesn't know the evil satanic monster, it is being manipulated by.Republican , sure - )))))))""Those who stay in America should be open to society without melting, keeping Mosques open so anyone can come and learn about Islam. If you choose to live here, you have a responsibility to deliver the message of Islam ...Islam isn't in America to be equal to any other faiths, but to become dominant. The Koran, the Muslim book of scripture, should be the highest authority in America, and Islam the only accepted religion on Earth.""Omar Ahmad- Co-founder of the Council on American-Islamic Relation (CAIR)"
4,Excellent view of Americans and Muslims,"For individuals who which to know more about the connections between Muslims and Americans, this is the book. Even as a graduate student, no other book taught me more about the Muslim mindset. Compared to Findley's other book, ""THEY DARE TO SPEAK OUT"", this is a far more optimistic tome. I particular enjoyed the section where the Constitution melds perfectly with traditional Islamic belief. I also liked learning more about why Muslims dress the way they do, how men/women interect, and the growing political power.Sadly, this book has a flaw that is not its own fault; it was released just before the 9/11 attacks, and I felt that the attacks cast a shadow over the book that needed explaining. I recommend ""THEY DARE..."" to cover this."
1,Not Worth Your Money,"IF you haven't seen from the list of other books that Paul Findely has writeen, he is very much pro-Arab. His books are all based on anti-Israeli propaganda. I have only read parts of this book and was no surprised that the content was talking about how great Muslims are. Although i believe that the Muslim community in America is full of great people, this book does a disservice to the Americans that died on 9/11."
1,Candy Coated Bias,"This book ignores the darker side of Islam in the current age. America has been used as a haven for Islamic Terrorists like Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah to fund terrorist activities around the world. These groups, sponsored by muslims living here, manipulates and use our Freedoms to advance their terrorist activies while at the sametime calling for the destruction of America.The book ignores the Genocide committed by the Islamic Government of Sudan and the jailing and execution of foreign nationals in Saudia Arabia who wish to pray in their own homes.It is ignorant of the history of Jihad since the time of Mohammed. It is not the Jihad of ""internal struggle"" that we hear from Muslims today. It is the Jihad of conquest. The West is accused of Colonialism and Crusades but the author is all but silent on the Religious Colonialism of Islam.If you want true view of Islam, read Paul Fregosi's book Jihad."
5,"Rate the book instead of venting anger, please!",It's just as absurd (as seen several preceding reviews) to assume all muslims or arabs share the views of those who committed the horrific acts we saw last week as to assume all Christians or Americans of European descent supported the Oklahoma City federal building bombing.
1,not worth the shipping and connection kinda loose,Fry's has a similar one in the headset department for $2
5,Let's hear it for Hansie,I like James Last and do not care what type of music he is playing. For me he is the greatest big band still around.
5,This James Last is a jewel,"I love what James Last does to ""regular"" music I've heard before. His style adds sparkle to songs whether sad or happy or in-between and not too much chorus. This CD has a selection of songs almost perfect to me. I can play ""the power of love"" over and over and over, and his rendition of ""close to you"" is pure classic. If you like James Last or are curious to know him, this is a perfect CD for you."
1,Songs from the Heart,"Songs From the Heart CD James LastThe sound of the CD is very dry and you have to play with the volume control all through the CD. It makes for unpleasnat listening and is certainly not worth the $11.98 price paid. I listened to the sampling on the computer, which prompted me to purchase the CD, but I am very disappointed."
2,Not what I was looking for,This book was basically about the religion of the Copts. It was not informative about any other aspects of the culture.
1,Overpriced,"Spice is fine, but I was very disappointed in the price to value reward. It's a very small container and for $20 I expected more. My bad. I could have purchased more of this spice at World Market for $2 (and I have). Shipping and all was fine. It's just priced much too high for what I received. Should have done my homework on this one."
3,Almost adequate,"Book is seriously lacking required information to solve the examples let alone the problems. For example chapter six's first example is 6.2. What happened to 6.1? The equation for mean free path (6.6), what is p? Is it the same as P in equation (6.5)? Who knows since there is no example or explanation. Attempting to get the same reults in the text become time consuming and frustrating because all the required information is absent. The book is lacking detail. Avoid it at all possible costs. Hey anyone out there thinking they can write a better book than this go for it. This one needs to be put off the marketplace."
3,text for thin film processing class,"lots of info, and the content is good, but you definitely need to read it multiple times to understand what's going on."
3,Solid information,"I bought this textbook for a graduate level mechanical engineering course. The material in there is solid. The explanations are not always self-evident (i.e. I cannot understand all of the material without lecture to clarify the material), but all of the information is there."
5,Completely Satisfied,Product was in better condition than I expected! Barely any discoloration around edges and no marks noticed anywhere. Excellent for a papreback of its age!
1,This book is not worth the money,This book is very boring. The images produced are highly over rated. A complete oversaturation of sepia toning.This book is more of an artsy hype than fine art photographs.I was completely disapointed when I opened the covers.Don't waste your money on this one.
2,Not seating properly,"Flapper comes in tight squarish plastic container forcing the flapper to not sit flat in toilet tank.Several days latter still leakes because of this and causes tank to re fill many times a day, and night, most annoying."
1,this is way too expensive than at other places,"I registered for this set through BabySuperMall. Not only is the cost a whole lot less, but they offer all of the accessories that go with it, including extra fabric by the yard!"
5,Baby Luxury,"Purchased this ensemble (with the diaper stacker) after much shopping around and after purchasing a supposedly ""boutique"" set from another online retailer. The Glenna Jean set cost more, but was definitely well worth it, and it is made in the USA! I will pay extra for that label.I love the contrasting patchwork patterns of pink toile, pink gingham, the stars, and sage. The attention to detail is amazing. The sheer overlay on the crib skirt is beautiful. My ONLY concern is that the crib bumper is VERY plush. With all of the SIDS precautions in mind, I wish it were thinner and maybe a little taller rather than so thick."
2,Silly,"I have to give credit to these people for making this video, but I didn't find this to be a helpful learning video at all. The video was to short and all of the teaching was to quick and just not explained well. I have the basics in spanish but if I didn't this video would frustrate me and not teach me anything. I hate that I wasted my money purchasing this one."
5,French love them too,"I'm French I discovered the cd during a trip in California last summer and I really loved them but it was impossible to find their cd in a store in the US and in France as well. So thank you Amazon to deliver in France!Hope this group will be famous in France soon, like that maybe they'll do a concert in our country. But I'm sure they will, as Coldplay did few years ago."
2,Pleasant and boring,"Buy elbow's ""asleep in the back"" instead. This album has good ideas that never reach their potential. I was excited when the first song came on and the vocals sounding like Ian Brown...but that's whee it ended for me. A pile of good ideas and bad composition. This band will not resurface."
1,"can't review as I haven't heard the whole thing, but...","granted I can't be very objective as I haven't listened to the whole cd, but it must be said (and yes I know they have been compared in the main review) that the song Paint the Silence sounds so much like The Stone Roses I was convinced that they had simply stolen the song note for note and just changed the name. personally if two bands sound that much alike, I'm going to chose the original over the remake every time. The Stone Roses all the way."
5,south to throwback city,"Although I think they do have some similarities to Stone Roses, I think what people really dig about South is the ""created world"" aspect of this album. It really is its own universe and doesn't strive to be like any other music out there. I don't know how this music makes others feel, but for me, its a melancholy escape."
5,Just sit and listen,I first heard the song keep close on much music (the canadian version of mtv). It was on the hour late at night when they play stuff that's not quite mainstream.The song keep close just got to me and i had to get the album. This band has everything to make it big but i hope they don't. I would hate to see what commercialism would do to something this good.
5,All You Need To Know About Fasting,This Book has help me so much with fasting. Altough I've fast before I wanted to have my fasting not be in vain. This book answered a lot of questions that I had. It reviewd different eras in fasting. I wanted to start a study on prayer but God lead me to this book. It is not hard to read or filled with un-necessary college degree words. Both babes in Christ and more mature Christains will be blessed by this book.
5,Absolutely unbelievable movie.,"This is a movie I can watch over & over without ever getting bored. At first, I when I watched it, I found it enjoyable in something of a Mallrats sort of way, mainly because Steve Zahn just blows you away with his humor & stories.But it is greater than that. The depression that Josh Hamilton is going through is very strong & very real. He is apathetic about most everything, and floats around with his post relationship depression, but does care strongly for his friends Nicole & Freak.This movie is hypnotic. You find yourself thinking about it long after having seen it. The humor is amazing & it is brilliantly human."
1,I LOVE STEVE ZAHN BUT . . .,"This is a total WASTE OF TIME!! Unless you are an immature adolescent with nothing better to do, this one gets two thumbs down. No plot, acting is bad and even liking Steve Zahn doesn't help!"
4,"Believe it, man!","The cover of this video belies the exquisite sensitivity with which this film was shot, and the depth of the performances of its stars. Yes, this movie is hysterically funny and much of the humor comes from rampant drug use and sex talk; but the director's sensibility, and the sensitivity and awareness of the main characters is far more discerning and sophisticated than this genre's status quo. The main character wants and feels more than is comfortable in his given life; and it is that raw and difficult tension that adds dimension and subtlety to this film. I have never before seen the inner struggle for growth be the primary conflict explored in this genre. And here it is skillfully done, without ever losing the humor and fun inherent in its story."
3,Fun movie - lousy ending,"This movie has a great story. The incest situation is handled well. It's not too blatant but obviously there. However, it's all ruined by a really lousy ending, truly unbelievable. How are dead people suddenly resurrected? No explanation. Weird!"
3,Needs rubber feet on the bottom,"The bottom of this thing is hard plastic, so it has no resistance when placed on a hardwood floor. Seems well made, otherwise."
2,not as good as carpet,I bought one of these posts for my cat and she doesn't really use it much. I think a post with carpet instead of rope would work better.
1,Not for my cat,"My cat rarely used this scratching post. I got a different scratching post, also made of sisal but with a carpet base, put it right next to this one and he did use the new post. I ended up throwing this one away after a few months. I noticed that the rope was fraying a lot, despite him rarely using it. The base is too small and it tips over very easily, scaring the cat."
1,falls over way too easily,Within minutes of bringing this home I was ready to return it. The base it too flimsy and light - so everytime the cats try to scratch it the whole thing tips over. I solved the problem temporarily by putting an 8 lb weight on the base. Hopefully Amazon will take this back so I can buy something decent!
1,Not what I ordered,Not only was the item not what I ordered ( it was a cheap version with a pad of sisal instead of being wrapped with sisal)- there was no return label or address or anything. I would never order anything from this store again.
5,Great Hiking Guide,I would recommend this guide to anyone interested in hiking in the New River Gorge and in the Cranberry Glades recreation area. Now I have a bunch of places that I want to visit when we go out to WV in September!
1,Where is the piano??????,I must say that when i saw the cd on the stores i Bought it without thinking much... THAT WAS REALLY BAD in most of the tracks you can barelly hear the piano and when you do it has not much to say. The playing is without soul and the music is in general mutilated I have I only heard the cd twice and the only good thing about it was that it helped me find the titles of some classics i loved and didn't know their name.Its obvious the guy is trying to sell himself like Vanessa Mae but at least you can hear the violin when vanessa plays !!!!
3,"Size is a bit small, but, it's a great quality poster.","Just looking at the tube it came in I new I had something that was worth my money. The tube was a few inches longer than the poster so i thought it'd be bigger, but it was rather small. Still, for the price and the size the quality of the poster was very good.Only complaint is the size, besides that, it's a great poster."
2,crack!,"the belt cracked after just a few weeks use. It still works months later, but it's cracked up on the back."
3,Who's Moms?,"I love to cook, love the Food Network and I adore cookbooks. For that reason, I enjoyed much of this book. I just didn't know many of the cooks in the book as I would have liked to and therefore wasn't quite as interested in their stories. I would love to see an updated version of this book with all of the ""current"" chefs that are on TV and creating masterpieces in some of the great restaurants today."
2,Hero was too annoying to live,"My Loving Familiar has a neat premise but falls flat with its goofy hero, painfully stereotypical characters and a heroine who loves the hero despite the fact that he's rude, condescending and supposedly in love with another woman while mooning over her throughout the majority of the book. The plot features a likable heroine, a magical cat and one genuine laugh out loud moment but even that wasn't enough to save this far too average (and often annoying) story."
4,The Miyu Experience,"The first thing that you'll think upon opening this graphic novel is, ""oooh...Pretty..."" And it is. The flowing lines of the drawings make them seem like they really move. The characters all have pretty doll-like faces that are nothing but eye candy for the reader. The stories can get a little awkward if you don't read them closely, it may take a second reading to get everything straight, but just to look at the pictures is reason enough to buy this graphic novel. Even prettier than Yu Watase, and much darker and more surreal. Even those who aren't fans of the series will love this novel."
3,SO SO Nothing new we didnt know before,This book was satisfying yet leaves you hanging. It wasnt all that good. I liked the historical account of how the Irish Kennedys made it to America it was nicely written. The part about JOhn Jr & Carolyn Besette was thought provoking & shows us that their image did not measure up to what really went on in their real life. I truly felt sorry for them. Anyway ut was an alright book so I had to rate it a 3. I think the book was hyped up & failed to deliver to the hype.
2,The Kennedy Arrogance,"OK, I bought it, I read it. But considering Mr. Klein's resume (I haven't read his previous Kennedy books), this is a slick, cheap read -- albeit a quick one. The Kennedy Curse should have been name Kennedy Arrogance. With the exception of the original Patrick, whose story is typical of the thousands of Irish who emigrated to America, curses or even fate seem to have little to do with the series of tragedies striking this family -- it always boils down to arrogance, for whatever that arrogance may be a cover. But, hey -- it's a page turner -- even if we've heard all the stories before."
2,2.5 stars; buyer beware,"While there is some merit to Edward Klein's books, they read like tabloid journalism. More importantly, there are passages which raise eyebrows, such as his alleged interview with Dave Powers. Read with a skeptical eye.Vince Palamara-JFK/ Secret Service expert (History Channel, author of two books, in over 30 other author's books, etc.)Pittsburgh, PABEST JFK ASSASSINATION BOOK: ULTIMATE SACRIFICEBEST JFK SECRET SERVICE BOOK: SURVIVOR'S GUILT BY YOURS TRULY :)"
1,"Boring, tired subject","Will there ever be a day when people just stop writing about the Kennedys? I'm not saying this because I'm a fan of the Kennedys, but because there have been thousands of books written about these people. I think everyone has said everything they need to say. There is no ""curse"". The Kennedys are a large family. Accidents happen (such as the many plane crashes that have claimed the lives of some Kennedys). There are logical explainations for the deaths of these people.As for all the Kennedys who bring bad publicity upon themselves: hey, for every William Kennedy Smith there is a Caroline Kennedy. A lot of the Kennedys have used their name to do good, but I guess no one will ever write a book about those people because they're just not interesting enough."
2,No good unless you're a Kennedy worshipper AND superstitious,"What can I say about a sentence like this: ""The sons of these (Irish) immigrants (such as the Kennedys) were often treated worse than Negro slaves.""Geez, with such historically uninformed, Kleenix-inducing blather like that (with which professional historians AND the descendants of those slaves would disagree), what else can you say about the suck-up level of this book?There are a few historical nuggets to be found if you can get past BOTH the hagiography AND the superstitiousness of the author believing in a literal Kennedy family curse.But, it's really not worth that much effort, probably.Also, the Bushes, and with far more justification, the Adamses, might object to the Kennedys being labeled America's greatest political dynasty."
1,The Worst Kennedy Book Ever,"I have never felt that spending money on a book is a waste, until I bought ""The Kennedy Curse."" It is absolutely one of the worst books I have ever read. I want my money and the time I spend reading this piece of garbage back!"
1,I should never have bought this BOOK,"I was flying out to Vegas and needed something to read on the plane.I hate to fly,but after reading ""The Kennedy Curse,""I started to enjoy the plane ride alot more.This book has nothing new we haven't read about years ago.Its simply to read,and the Kennedys have chapters dedicated to there tragic lives,starting with Patrick Kenndy,JFK,Joseph,Kathleen,William Kennedy Smith,and John Kennedy Jr.All I kept saying to myself while reading ""THE Kennedy Curse"" is,I could Write a Book better than this."
3,Mediocre with lots of extra information,"I didn't want to read this book until I read the feature article excerpting the book in Vogue. After starting the book, I learned quickly that the article was the most interesting thing I would read by Richard Klein. Although he has great details about the earlier Kennedys, the book tends to deviate from the curse and goes into too much detail about the setting and weather. It soon gets strenuous until you wish for it to end. Take my advice and only read the excerpt in Vogue. It'll make you think of what actually was lost that day in summer 1999."
3,"It's not a curse, it's bad judgment","This book was disappointing. It was slim pickings compared to other books about the Kennedy clan, though it did sprinkle some interesting psychological insights throughout. The worst part about it was the author's flimsy and self-contradictory arguments as to why the Kennedys are supposedly suffering from a supernatural curse. As he so clearly shows, if the Kenedys are suffering from anything, it's bad judgment. Deluding themselves as accursed not only helps them evade responsibility from their poor judgments and the consequences, but also makes them appear all the more ""special."" Most people who behave the way they do are likely to be called ""stupid"" or ""irresponsible"" but not cursed. Of course, how many people would go out and buy a book called, ""How the Kennedys suffer from their own bad judgment."" When the Kennedys start to think before they act, they might find the ""curse"" disappears."
1,Save your money,"This story has been told plenty of times before and in a more interesting manner particularly in Doris Kearns Goodwins' book, The Fitzgeralds and Kennedys. The difference with Klein's book is the new chapter of JFK, Jr. and his bride. But Klein really adds nothing new to that particular tragedy.In addition to rehashing old facts and rumors, Klein's book has an air of sensationalism about it. It was hard to take this work seriously as he put forth some of his theories with no hard facts to back them up. The misfortunes that have been visited upon this family are more a result of their storied recklessness than a curse. I've never particularly been swept up in the public fascination with the Kennedys but I've read and know enough about them to say with confidence that you don't need to buy this book. You won't learn anything that hasn't been written before."
1,A Sorry Story,I have enjoyed reading Ed Klein's biography's in the past but this book is so insubstancial as not to be worth a second glance. If all you are after is the JFK Jr. revelations buy Vanity fair...its all covered in the article and it will cost you less
3,"Karma, fate & fascination","There are too many Kennedy books out there, but I did enjoy this one. For the most part, the author did his job. Klein researched the history in detail and makes you want to read more. This is a easy, quick book to read, but it still does not answer many questions. Why are these people do obsessed with their own egos and why do we care? It is all karma and fate...but is it a genetic curse predetermined at birth?"
1,Ghost Written,This book was not written by its so called author. It was written by a hack journalist with questionable moral values and little journalist experience in order for Klein to cash in on the over played Kennedy brand.
1,Clumsy Propaganda,"This book reads like something dopey people buy when checking out of a supermarket. Its tabloid trash, full of dubious assertions such as that the Kennedy brothers had something to do with Marilyn Monroe's alleged murder and the unworthiness of the Kennedy family to get any social recognition, as they all descended from a salon keeper.A typical Klein distortion involves Joe Kennedy Jr. This Kennedy flew some 33 missions in World War 11, He did, as ordered, try for a 34th mission, even though the plane may have had defective wiring. The plane blew up killing Joe Jr., but Klein takes him to task for taking too much risk. Joe Jr. was a good soldier, a standup guy, a hero, while author Edward Klein is a mere clumsy propagandist."
3,Interesting but dubious,"While I enjoyed reading this book I felt that it was a highly fictionalized account. It was full of hyperbole,grisly details,speculation, third and fourth hand accounts and false conclusions. For example in the account of William Kennedy Smith's rape trial there is the statement that had there been a conviction that would have been the end of the Kennedy family. That is completely bogus. The section on Roosevelt and Joe Kennedy Senior is probably the best in the book but because of other errors in the book even this section is not neccesarily believable. As for the well publicized revelations about JFK Jr, one can not help but feel pain for the tragic end but also one must be skeptical of the narrative. In short while this book makes for colorful reading the details and conclusions must be taken wiith a grain of salt."
4,Impressive for the price,"The Onkyo HT-SR600S 5.l Home Theater Entertainment System is quite nice for the price! I gave it as a gift, and the recipients are very pleased."
5,"Great sound, great price","I would recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for an awesome stereo for under $300. It packs a huge punch and sounds amazing. The sub woofer shakes my whole room in movies, the 5.1 surround is awesome, and the speakers look good, sound good, and don't take up too much room. I had never heard of Onkyo, but I definitely would buy their stuff again."
1,Subwoofer and Sound Not All That Great,"I returned this item for a full refund including shipping. Amazon is great about returns and for that I give Amazon high marks. The subwoofer to this stereo was not powered so the bass was terrible. The speakers weren't all that great either. I would recommend this system to a buyer who is looking for low to mid quality sound but if you are into bass and a sound that punches, this system is not for you. I do not recommend this item because for the price you pay the features and sound are just not worth it, sorry."
2,"Good for movies, bad for music","I ordered this item to replace my aging stereo. I'm returning it. The sound is boomy. It is almost like listening to music with your head in a plastic garbage can. I tried all the sound mode/bass/treble/individual speaker volume settings and couldn't fix it (some extreme EQ settings in Itunes made it tolerable - but by no means good). I was going to give it a reasonable try (perhaps I just had to get used to surround sound), but it was actually painful, even at low volume levels. I can see why this set would be boomy, it's a very powerful amplifier driving some very lightweight plastic speakers (so lightweight I was able to hang them on the wall with picture hook nails).Some movies (such Master and Commander with the 5.1 sound track) sounded spectacular, but most music didn't."
4,NO ODB!!!,"Wutang the greatest group In hip hop period! We all agree! Rza,Gza,Inspector Deck,Genius,Master Killa,Ghostface,method man,odb(r.i.p) cappadonna form like voltron! But this show was missing ODB Greatly! They did'nt seem inspired at all! They were tired,high,possibly drunk!!! Lol smoking weed on stage and an all around awright show! If u want the vest 1 and odb's last performance B4 his untimely death get the other live jount when they were in cali!! That was kill wirh all nine original members us alumni,buddha monk,cappadonna,brooklyn zoo and others! This 1 is good but the 1 with dirty is off the meter! Still a good buy! Get a very good used copy for cheap!!"
5,Great service,The product is wonderful. Nothing different that other models.The seller has excellent service too.
5,Solid Calculator,"I love my TI-86. I got my first one over 3 years ago for AP Calculus, and when the screen for that one was destroyed (stepped on, I believe), I didn't hesitate to buy the same model second hand. It has good calculus abilities, and excellent graphing features. The conversions are handy, and good to familiarize yourself with. I've dropped this calculator several times from desk height (3 feet) with no problems- it is sturdy.I would recommend this calculator for any math student, physics student, or engineer."
5,Answer to conversions review.,"The TI-86 is a versatile instrument for any calculus or physics student. The calc includes decimal to fraction convertor, but it is a custom convertor. The calc has a custom menu that allows you to store at least 15 not very accessible functions. I have used mine for years and it is probably the best calc that you can use on most standardized tests."
4,Wish it had batteries,"I wish they would have said that it did not come with batteries but other wise, product was as they had described."
4,TI-86 Review,"This is one of the nicest calculators i have used except for the 89. I love the custom catalog menu. It eliminates having to look in multiple folders for functions like on the 82, 83, and 83 plus. I like it better than the 85 because theres more mem and the screen is black now a grayish green. Its high quality and there are loads of game and other good school related programs."
5,Really great for anything.,"All in all I found that this calculator is best for almost anything. The solvers are great for simple and advanced problems in Algebra I and higher. The custom menu feature is great. When I made the transition from the venerable TI-82, I was shocked, the exponent of +/- 999 is neat seeing how most scientifics can only handle +/- 99. But, the thing I use is the programming capabilities to solve problems on an I/O basis. A great buy."
1,Not working properly,"This product looked good ,came in a timely manner and worked for 2 days I did not read the fine print and the window closed before I had a chance to return it.Did not like the device now I'm stuck with a piece a junk . thanks for nothing."
4,Aysha's dad,"I purchased this product for my daughter for school. I was very satisfied with the quality and condition of the product. However, I did find it difficult to find instructions online, but my daughter has not complained; so I'm inclined to believe she's happy. So, based on that I'm happy."
2,calc works fine,I am satisfied with the product. It was in good condition and all but the thing that I dont like is that the picture is never what the product is. The picture shows a calculator with the programming cable and it does not come with it. Why show a picture of something and then not include it. False advertising.
5,Served me well to date,"I purchased my TI-86 Graphing Calculator about halfway through my precalculus course during sophomore year of high school, and it has served me well all the way through getting a 5 on the AP Calculus BC test.My high school normally gives out 85's for students to use during the year, but I found that the Table function makes the 86 a much more valuable tool than the 85. Using that table enabled me to get my work done faster and more accurately than other students in the class that used the school-loaned 85.Overall, I'd say getting an 86 is a good investment for math levels, until you reach higher level calculus, when it may be in your best interests to invest in a TI-89."
2,"faulty product, bad service",Bought a Texas Instruments TI-86 Graphing Calculator from them. Not even one month it went dead and nothing showed up on the screen. I sent an email but no reply. So I put my review. Immediately they emailed me and promised to send a replacement right the way. It had been two weeks passed and I did not receive anything. I emailed them but never got reply.
5,The GOD of all calculators,This is the God of all calculators (still haven't tried out the 89 & 91's). It has awesome program capability and a huge amount of ram. It can do everything.
3,College Un-Necesities,"This TI may be ideal for those college students who are exploring the major of Mathamatics; But I feel that the requirement of purchesing such a high proformance computer, for lower level math classes is redicules. a) students use only a small amount of the functions. b) the price is outragous for what functions you do use."
5,Just the best song in the world,"The video is wonderful, with those robots who start loving one another! She's brilliant, clever, her sound is really penetrating and never boring. You just can't stop listening to it! Thank you Bjork. You're simply the best"
4,c'est amusant,"I bought this video for my nine year old sisters (I took French, so of course they want to copy me). My sisters are homeschooled by my mother. My mother and sisters viewed it. My mother knows no French besides croissant, and my sisters know some French songs from the Family Circus Lyric Language cassette (which I highly reccommend). Anyway, my mother and sisters learned from it. It goes too fast, though, and it attempts to cover too much in 30 minutes. My mother was lost at some points. It's actually humorous. Not bad for ""edutainment."" It's a pretty good introduction (or supplement) for junior high to adult, and a good supplement for third/fourth grade and up. Use the Family Circus Lyric Language French cassette for an introduction (as well as any french kids' songs you can get your hands on) for younger kids."
2,A product of modern TCM,"This text is both well-written and comprehensive in its detail of modern TCM, and also sorely lacking in the nuance and subtlety that is the heart of Chinese medicine from which modern TCM is derived. It is a useful text with which to prepare for board exams, but of very limited benefit in its contribution to a sensitive exploration of the classical approaches to health and illness that Chinese medicine offers. If this book is optional for you, I would encourage you to go hear Mr. MacIocia speak in person, and then decide if he is the scholar whose text you want at this price."
4,"Simple, Straight Forward, Easy to Understand","This textbook is very easy to understand. It's written in a very clear and concise manner. The occasional diagrams illustrate the points very well. I also like the ""summary boxes"" after each detailed section."
3,"Giovanni, Giovanni, Giovanni","The reason why I gave it three stars is mainly due to two factors: The over saturation of required Chinese medical texts with Giovanni's books, and two, this book seems like at times, it could use some condensing and editing. With that said, though, I have found this book to be helpful to me when learning symptoms and organ patterns, and it is pretty user friendly."
1,Video is horrible,"Sorry, but it's true. This video is a waste and a scam. The sound quality at times is awful! If you want to learn how to strip a gun go on youtube and watch it for free. Or ask someone at your local gun shop. A large portion of the first disc was filler of the companies other videos...about cowboy shoot! Tactical shotgun or people in western novelty shooting old weapons. At one point there is a 20 minute (could be more, I fast-forwarded) scene about black-powder shotguns shooting clays!! Tactical shotgun??? Also, who wants to watch a guy fumble through basic shooting and what seems like ad lib nonsense. No thanks. Save your money, and I wouldn't trust anything from this company. Glad I borrowed the dvd instead of purchased."
1,Revere Polished Alumium Skillet,"Lasted one year. Non-stick worked great until it didn't. Soak, soak, soak until the scrambled egg residue softens up enough to be scraped off. That means leaving the pan full of soapy water until you get back from work."
3,quality control?,This skillet arrived today with a noticeably warped upper edge although the packaging was quite adequate and undamaged.It also seems a lighter gauge aluminum than I would expect for the price---have to be careful of burning food.
2,Sold Damaged,"The product seems nice enough, but arrived with a large (6 inch) gouge that would not have passed any kind of quality control. I therefore have to assume they don't have any. There was no damage to the packaging, so it was put in the box this way."
3,"okay, but not what I expected","I was hoping to replace a Revere skillet that had scatches and a little peeling of the nonstick surface. I assumed this would be as thick bottomed as the previous one, but was disappointed. This skillet is better than others I looked at in stores for comparable prices. It's getting really hard to find anything that is not a ""saute pan"". I like the taller, straight sides on my old skillet and that is why I gave it a try. Will do until I find my ""dream skillet"". If anyone knows of one, let me know."
4,Durable,"You will be satisfied with the overall quality of these skillets. They are durable, yet not so heavy that you can't lift them. The only problem is that some slight discoloration seems to occur on the outside of the skillet's shiny surface over time. Otherwise they seem to be very durable."
2,Residue on bottom of pan,"I really liked this pan until just recently. When used, it develops a residue on the bottom of the pan, almost like eggs have dripped over the side. The mess on our stove is awful."
2,Less than enthusiastic,"Despite other negative reviews, we bought this tape because our 14 mo. old LOVES Baby Einstein and Baby Mozart. We're sorry we bought it. Baby Bach has a similar format to the first 2 videos in the series but you would think that someone entirely different created the video. It is slow paced, the toys are less vibrant and the music selections are less than energetic. This would be more appropriate for very young babies to view before bedtime. However, my daughter, who will stare at most anything on the television, completely ignored this video. It would seem that the creators sacrificed quality to get another video out quickly. But never fear...Baby Shakespeare is excellent! If you have to make a choice...skip this one. Otherwise, I'm sure it would help for the sake of having some variety."
3,"OK, . . .but Baby Mozart was better","We purchased Baby Mozart for our daughter when she was about 6 months old and she loved it. We bought Baby Bach a few weeks later and, while she enjoyed it a little, Baby Bach is not as good. There are a lot more static shots with little or no movement and some scenes are repetitious. The producer also put their daughter (and other kids - maybe friends/neighbors) in the video and these scenes just don't fit in. It's obvious that they were just stuck in because they thought that it would be ""cute"" - it really wasn't. The music on this video is not as lively as the Mozart tape either.In my experience these tape (Baby Mozart and Baby Bach) are great for the 6 - 12 month age range. They really hold the child's attention. When our daughter turned one she began to lose interest in these tapes."
2,Taken a-Bach by this DVD,"After we realized our son liked the Baby Mozart DVD, we decided to purchase more in the series. Being huge classical music fans we decided Baby Bach was the next logical choice. We are rather disappointed with Baby Bach, though. For one, our son (who is almost 1) doesn't seem at all interested in it (and it's not that he doesn't like Bach; he has the Pipe toy and loves to play with it - I've also written a review of that in the Toys area). Secondly, and this is probably just my personal bias, but there's just waaaay too much of the Clark children talking and dancing - it really interrupted the flow. Regarding the flow in general, the whole Theatre presentation seemed just thrown together: clumsy, illogical transitions and lots of extraneous sounds. I would recommend folks skip this one - if you get it as a gift, see if your child likes it, but don't spend the money yourself."
3,Baby Mozart is better,"Having enjoyed Baby Mozart, we bought this (and Baby Van Gogh) for our baby--but this one was disappointing. The most disturbing thing to me is the role that Julie Clark's two daughters play in this video. They tell silly jokes, smile at the camera, hug each other--it's a little weird, frankly, and has nothing whatsoever to do with Bach.The coordination between the music and the moving toys on the screen is also not as good in this video as in Baby Mozart. The toys don't do as much, and the camera doesn't move in very interesting ways. (On at least five different occasions, the camera just sits on a toy instrument, while someone plays a major scale--on a completely different instrument--in the background. That's not very imaginative.) Finally, I don't like the performances of the music on the synthesizer. I think Bach can be performed on real musical instruments in ways that even very young children can enjoy."
2,SO annoying,"I agree with the earlier review... the most annoying part of this DVD is that Julie Clark put her own kids in it. They are unnatural in the video and I'd like to see a little more diversity throughout.My daughter will watch it as intently as Mozart and Beethoven, but I personally cannot stand to hear it and watch it with her (although I lovingly will since our Beethoven is lost and Mozart needs a break). It seems just thrown together and more like a home video.Use more boys and diverse children in the videos!"
4,"To me, it's the most boring but to my baby...","LOVES it! We have Mozart, Newton, Neighborhood Animals and Discovering Water and this is by far his favorite! But it may be just for the time being. A friend lent this to me to try before we buy and my 9 month old seems to be glued to it much more than the others. I don't know if he's just maybe tired of the others or what but I DO know that he LOVES this one. However, it is very annoying to me -- Ms. Clark's oldest daughter, who is the ""star"" is such a complete HAM who seems to have her 8 year old ego stroked every time she opens her mouth, the room roars with laughter. But...my son loves it and that's what counts and it does allow me to get some things done while he's watching!"
3,Baby Bach DVD,"Baby Beethoven was the best, so I didn't hesitate to buy Baby Bach. A little disappointing compared to the first. What most annoyed me was the forced spotlight on the two Clark girls. Didn't add anything to the video and was a little too ""aren't Julie's girls cute"" for my taste."
2,Not as good as I had hoped for....,My son (6 months old)has loved watching Baby Mozart since he was about 2 months old. I decided to purchase Bach hoping for the same results. He doesn't seem as interested in Bach as he is with Mozart. There is too much of the creator's children in the video. Mozart is our favorite by far!
3,"Not as good as Baby Mozart, but enjoyable nonetheless","My child is a big fan of Baby Mozart, so we bought Baby Bach hoping for more of the same. We were a little bit disappointed (although our child seemed to like it!). If you only buy one video, buy Baby Mozart as it is superior to Baby Bach. The music in Baby Bach is not as well orchestrated, and the sequences are not as interesting. However, if your baby needs a break from Baby Mozart (we have watched our copy so many times that it is getting fuzzy!), then Baby Bach is a good addition."
4,Toddlers Still Loving It,My two year old daughters have been watching the entire series since they were wee ones - about 4 mos. old. We recently purchased the Bach video. While I agree with some of the comments that the quality isn't the same as the Mozart and Einstein videos... I have to say that my daughters beg for this video by name. They love the entire series. Not bad for any video(s)-- to entertain a child for over two years. And they still fascinate them.I wish the producers would come out with another one!
2,Annoying promos at the beginning,"When I want to sit my toddler down to watch a DVD, I don't want to have to wait for silly Walt Disney DVD intros, or a plug by the founder for more stuff on the website. It takes me a full minute to get the DVD going. Please, let's just get to the material, I am very busy. Overall this DVD is okay, but not stellar, just keeps my little guy entertained for a bit. Much more prefer ""Signing Time"", which is much higher quality throughout, with no annoying intro filler."
1,Same old thing [....],"I just can't believe they put out the same video as Baby Mozart but with a bit of variation and music change. That's marketing.These videos are great for putting infants to sleep, but not much else.I recommend the Baby Know It All series. They use children illustrating activities, a whole range of music, and our baby actually learns while having fun. Great precurser to sesame street. They are hard to find, though.Seems like the good things always are."
4,Adds Variety to the Mozart series,Nice addition to our einstein library. Goes well with the Baby Webster cards or 18mo is enamoured with.
1,Not as good as the others...,"Given that my son loves Baby Mozart, I went out and bought a number of other tapes, including Baby Bach. Wish I had read some of the reviews before hand! This video is simply not as good as the Mozart one. I was disappointed that the creator's children are featured in it as well. Loud and out of place laughs seem to startle my son. The graphics are similar, but I'm beginning to feel that ""if you've seen one you've seen them all"" and in this case, I recommend against buying this tape."
5,Beautiful.,"These DVDs are not only educational, they are full of great colours, toys and music that you and your child can share. In my experience the Baby Bach DVD in particular is great for settling an infant mid-tantrum!"
1,don't really get it...,"i got this for my 5.5 mo daughter at the suggestion of a cousin. maybe i had high expectations based on the reviews, and the fact that i love classical music, but i don't really get the attraction. my daughter was bored pretty quickly. we'll give it one more try when she's a little older but i think it'll end up in the ""donate"" bin by the end of the year..."
2,Pass on this one!,"My baby loves Baby Beethoven, so we tried Baby Bach for a little variety. Her verdict was... BORING. She won't watch Bach, while she remains riveted to Beethoven. I don't think they did testing to see what would interest babies on this product. I still am a strong proponent of Baby Einstein DVDs, but some are much better than others. Pass on this one."
3,Pretty good,"This dvd is pretty good. It's not as good as the Baby Mozart, but it's not bad either. My son will watch it, but I have to keep directing his attention back to it at times. The music is not as peppy as the Baby Mozart, but Baby Bach is still musical in nature-making it better than all of the other Baby Einstein dvd's we have with the exception of Baby Mozart."
5,My son loves it..,"Baby Bach was our first Baby Einstein video, so my son is partial to it. He is just simply mesmerized by the colorful visuals and the wonderful music. As for the creator's children appearing in the video, my son loves those parts. He plays peek-a-boo with the baby in the video and dances along with them. All-in-all, we have found this video to be a nice early learning tool for our family."
4,"A good, cheerful dvd","I bought the whole Baby Einstein set, (10 so far) for my daughter when she was 2 months old. So far this one is by far her favorite of the ones for 18 months and under. She laughs and talks to it, she especially likes the children's appearances. I'd recommend it, especially if you can find the set, it's way cheaper than buying them individually."
3,"Not high quality, but still entertaining","This is the first tape in the series that I have seen. I was not at all impressed with the sound quality on the tape. The music really vibrated through the speakers, even at low volume. The makers of this video went out to a novelty gift store to buy the props for this video (lightning ball, rainbow strobe, back-flipping dog, etc.), which made it seem cheap from an adult perspective.Fortunately, my 3-month-old baby has not yet developed very discerning tastes. He watches the video quietly and seems to enjoy it. As long as cost is within your budget, then I would recommend this video for kids under a year, though other reviewers seem to think other tapes in this series are better."
2,I had high hopes of this video relaxing my son...,"... but no such luck.I started playing the video when he was two months old. He would watch it and gradually dozed off, but two parts consistently woke him up. The ""Cluck cluck cluck"" of toy chickens, and the ""clank clank clank"" of coins being dropped into a metal bank. I continued playing the video until he was three and a half months old, but have given up on it for the moment.If only the volume had been softened on these two parts, we would have enjoyed the video more. My son did seem to like to look at the faces of the toddlers, so that part did not bother me.I received a free CD which had the cluck-cluck-cluck, clank-clank-clank and children's laughter eliminated. He enjoys listening to the CD on road trips.If I had my way, the music in the video would have been softer, less plunky."
1,Save your money,"Like most people here, this video doesn't hold a candle to Baby Mozart which my baby loved: it's not as captivating, the flow is disrupted by the little daughters appearing for no reason, and the selection of Bach music was poor. C'mon, ""Air"" played the way it was is not going to get the babies attention at all. And the Clark parents went overboard by putting their kids in way too many skits .... They seemed to disrupt the flow.Save your money if you are expecting something as good as Baby Mozart. We feel like these folks just wanted to throw something together figuring that parents like us would buy Baby Bach since we all loved Baby Mozart so much. Well it worked."
2,Tries to be Baby Mozart but not as good,"I bought this tape after my infant daughters fell under the delightful spell of Baby Mozart. While this tape is also primarily soothing classical music and video footage of toys and puppets, it doesn't seem to work the magic that Baby Mozart does. My girls lose interest in the tape about halfway through. I have had much better luck with Baby Van Gogh and Baby Newton."
2,Not so good for infants,"Regrettably, Baby Bach just doesn't have the infant-mesmerizing magic of the Baby Beethoven and Baby Mozart DVDs. The toys are not very interesting, many are static, and many seem to be there only to sell more toys. Our six-month old loves Baby Beethoven and Baby Mozart, but he can't stand ten minutes of this one."
2,Not nearly as good as Baby Mozart,"My son (8 months)seems really bored with this one. Baby Mozart has great music and the shown items are always moving. This one has great music, but has way too many still shots. Loses baby's attention often."
3,Baby Bach,Don't worry about the chicken scene.I had the old version.The old version had clown faces on top of rabbets.
2,"""Baby Mozart"" still triumphs over this one!","""Baby Mozart"" is a better title, but my daughter's favorite DVD now is ""Singing Babies Nursery Rhyme Time."" Classical music is fine, but I wanted my girl to know all the classic nursery rhymes that I grew up knowing. ""Singing Babies"" has gotten her making sounds and clapping. I am very impressed."
2,Does'nt live up to the hype.,"I've got a 2 year old and a 3 1/2 year old, and I was tempted to buy the Einstein videos based on word of mouth, but decided to try a neighbors copy first. Unfortunately, I wasn't all that impressed. More importantly, my kids seemed disinterested. I've read a few of the unfavorable reviews I've seen lately and have to agree with their opinions. Another Mom friend recommended a new series that just cam out called ""Lots To Learn"" There are two available that I've seen: Lots To Learn: Nature, and Lots To Learn: In My House. I've watched Nature and we all love it. I'm going to purchase Lots To Learn: In My House "" next, and I'll let you know my feedback, but they seem to be more educational and less condescending to the kids, more professionally produced like Sesame street."
2,Beware - this video can be scarey for some children,"My twins (22 months) love elmo and I wanted them to try something else. So we rented this DVD, one of the twins was very scared of some of the scenes in this video. It had her screaming in terror. The scenes with the dark backgrounds, especially the one with the touch globe were the ones that were frightening to her."
2,Skip it!,"My sixteen month old son and I are huge fans of this series, but Baby Bach falls short of the rest. The skits are random, repetitive and portions are scary. My son actually cries if we watch it. Order Baby Mozart, Baby Shakespere and World Animals and skip Baby Bach."
4,Baby Mozart is a tough act to follow,"Not as good as Mozart, better than Solieri.Seriously, this is a good video. It has less music than does the Baby Mozart DVD, and it isn't as good as holding my daughter's attention, even though the format is the same. What can I say, I prefer Mozart as a composer also. Still, it is a nice diversion and a good introduction to classical music."
2,Probably the worst ever,"After receiving Baby Beethoven as a gift for my daughter, she loved it and we decided to collect them all. This one, however, is one of the worst. There's very little activity to keep her attention for long. Ths little girls in it are cute, but they don't really do much, I would pick Beethoven & Mozart over this one anyday!"
2,Good product bad quality DVD,I have already bought the Beethoven and Mozart DVD which my daughter loves so I bought the Bach too. We put the disc in a new DVD player and find that it freezes and has digital drop out though-out the playback. Hardly worth the 20 bucks or so that I paid for it. If I wanted bad quality I would have bought a pirated version for $3.
2,Run Time Listing is Wrong,This DVD is only 30 minutes....not 172 minutes! Overall a very great DVD. My 5 month old loves it. Was just disappointed as I wanted something a little longer for my car DVD player.
4,Baby Bach,I had looked for this video at all of our retail stores that carry Baby Einstein products and none of them carry it any longer. My Grandson has all of the other cds and videos. He also has many of the books and toys. He loves them...and he really wanted this one! I ordered it for his birthday. It came quickly and he was thrilled. Easy to order and reasonably priced...my kind of toy!
1,Bach Bad...Mozart Good,Since my 6 month old loves Baby Mozart we decided to buy Baby Bach. She starts to cry when we play the video. I guess I should have looked at the reviews before buying it.
5,Kaya loves this tape!,My two month old daughter has been faithfully watching this and Baby Mozart since she was one month old...she is completely fascinated with this tape and she's starting to talk and laugh at the objects on the screen....I even feel entertained!Very adorable and studies show that it increases baby brainpower!
4,Great for the Teletubbie set,"A friend recommended this seriers of videos to us, and we are so glad she did! Our very energetic daughter can not stop for anything, yet she stops to watch and listen to Baby Bach. The first words out of her mouth each morning are ""Bach, Bach"" (funny, given the chicken puppet that shows up periodically). At any rate, she is interested, and really enjoys these videos. They are recommend for children aged 1-3, so that may explain why some of the parents of the younger infants may not be as satisfied as we are. Hang in there, it WILL be worth it."
1,Very disappointing -- save your money,"Baby Bach was a severe disappointment. Unlike their Baby Mozart video, which is lively and really holds our daughter's interest, this video is slow paced and not of much interest to our daughter. Also, the constant shots of the producer's daughters are highly annoying and should have been saved for their personal home videos. What ego!"
2,Underwhelming,"This one bores my son (4 mos.), which is no mean feat considering a lightbulb can occupy his attention for half an hour. Maybe these folks can come up with a Baby Lightbulb series; it would take as much craft as the video in question, which is mostly static camera shots of toys and home-video-esque ""ain't she a darling?"" shots of the filmmakers' kids."
2,Disappointing as compared to their Baby Mozart Video,"I was disappointed in this video. It really pales in comparison to their Baby Mozart video, which is very good. Given that this video was produced after Mozart, I expected improved production values. Instead, they were worse! This video isn't terrible, but maybe was just rushed to market to capitalize on the enthusiasm for their Mozart video. As others have noted, the frequent shots of the producers' daughters are just too much. However, the Baby Mozart video is better and worth purchasing."
5,Amazing,My 4 month old baby loved this dvd. He likes the music and the moving toys. Pictures change in a slow motion that is comfortable for young babies. I found this dvd very good.
5,Baby Bach Rocks,"My 8 month old son absolutely LOVES this dvd. We don't allow our children to watch tv for the most part. However, these videos are wonderful and really capture their attention. I really want my children to be musically aware and to develop a love of all forms of music, especially classical. This dvd is an excellent introduction of the baroque genre."
3,It's OK but not as great as the others.,"I purchased this DVD along with Baby mozart of the Baby Einstein Series, when my son was about 7 or 8 months old and my first though was, ""oh my God, how weird!"" but then i saw my son paying attention to the video, and smiling sometimes, so i gave it a try, he likes this video a lot, but he likes others much more, like Baby Mc Donnald, Numbers Nursery, Language Nursery, Shakespeare, etc and that is only from the Baby Einstein series, there are so many more educational videos, that will teach your child new things, that is true they will eventually learn without the videos, but the videos will make it faster, I am not a teacher, I am just a mom that wants the best for her 14 month old baby boy.So i would recommend this video for variety, it is good yes, but there are better."
1,"As everyone says, ""it's not Baby Mozart""","I have to agree with a lot of the reviews. This video isn't nearly as good as the Baby Mozart video. The compositions played are too short, the toys aren't as good as Baby Mozart, and there are too many scenes with the creator's children. Stay away from this one and get Mozart or Brainy Babies."
2,"Baby Bach, not as good as Baby Mozart","I have a 12 month old. We had Baby Mozart from the start and she loves it, stil, and I love it. It makes her smile, clap and bounce up and down with delight as soon as she hears the introductory music. I ignored the reviews and bought Baby Bach, for a change of pace. As one reviewer wrote, it does seem a lazier effort, the visual clips and the audio clips are much too short and not very interesting. Julie Clark's daughters are cute, but not very amusing for even my 12 month old. Baby Mozart was much, much better, but even Bach, is better TV than TV for young ones."
2,Disappointed with Baby Bach!,"My son who loves Baby Mozart cries non stop through Baby Bach. Having been a follow-up to Baby Mozart, I expected a higher quality video. Instead, the video is little more then a home movie of the producer's children. If children are to be included, please include girls AND boys - broaden the scope!"
3,Not as good as Baby Mozart,"I agree with the many reviews on here. While Baby Mozart is a ""must have"", this one is not. Although, I love the music of Bach, this video was a disappointment. I found the segments of the creator's daughter a bit too rehearsed and quite honestly, I'm not sure why they put her into it. It affects the flow of the video. Both Baby Mozart and Baby Bach appear ""homemade"", but Baby Mozart has much better flow and better choices of ""real world objects"". My son was not as ""mesmorized"" by Baby Bach as he was Baby Mozart."
1,A colossal disappointment,"Our two month old has loved Baby Mozart since she was a mere 4 weeks, yet STILL loves to watch it for the full time straight (yes, even with her ""baby attention span""). We LOVE everything about Baby Mozart. HOWEVER . . . (you knew there was a however) Baby Back is a HUGE disappointment. The video is hardly interesting (even to us grownups, who enjoy watching Baby Bach with our daughter), and appears to be an exercise in vanity for the video's makers, who have inserted their oh-so-trendily-named children throughout the video. Are we sure that this video wasn't made by Kathie Lee Gifford???? Meanwhile, the toys are slow moving, and boring to watch. My daughter has been bored to tears (literally) every time she watches this drivel. Baby Mozart, however, never fails to disappoint. Musicwise, while I LOVE Bach (more than Mozart), herr German Composer is given short shrift in this video. MORAL: STAY AWAY FROM IT AND BUY BABY MOZART INSTEAD!!!!!"
2,Cheaper Alternative,"I heard so much about Baby Einstein I just had to try it. Well I watched it with my five month old and determined that by playing classical music on my stereo and turning the tv on (to any channel), produced the same interest (changing shapes, colors, shadows, etc.) I really wouldn't invest in these and save your money for something else."
4,My son loves it,"I think that the quality of the music and toys in Baby Bach are just as good as in Baby Einstein and Baby Mozart. But I do agree that the segments with the creator's kids are irritating and shouldn't have been included. My husband also says that the older girl reminds him in a negative way of Jon-Benet Ramsey. I'm looking forward to seeing Baby Shakespeare, where I've been told there are other children present.But despite that, I'm glad I bought Baby Bach. My 2 year old son asks for it again and again, and the music doesn't get annoying at all with endless repitition."
2,Buy Baby Mozart Instead!,"Our one year old has loved Baby Mozart since she was 6 months old. I bought Baby Bach for variety - what a mistake! The toys don't move enough, the clips of the director's children are lame, and the music isn't nearly as catchy. This was horribly thrown together. If you want variety try something else. (Though we've also tried Baby Genius and others but nothing seems to hold our daughter's attention like Baby Mozart.) Good luck hunting, but please don't waste your money on this one."
2,Not to replace Baby Mozart!!!,"Hi;My 8 months old daughter loved Baby Mozart from the moment she watched it (she still does). I decided to add another baby einstein DVD to open up her horizon ... BIG MISTAKE!! I think that this is either a very boring DVD or it is for older kids (maybe over a year old).My daughter is also terrified by the scene with the light show. She looks at it & cries like she is terrified. It is slowly getting better, but I continue using baby Mozart more!Mona & Sina"
3,A warning,"My 16 month old son has come to enjoy videos immensely, andthis one is no exception. However, just a few minutes in, there is ahand puppet of a dragon that just terrified him. It even startled myhusband. We fast forward through that part, and after repeatedviewings he's not as upset, but I don't think there should be scaryparts in videos for babies..."
1,Absurd,"Not often is the cultural difference between Americans and the rest of the world this clear: This DVD is the silliest thing that I have ever seen - pictures of toys in motion, kids playing, other every day scenes - for crying out loud: Give your baby these toys and put on some classical music in the background, and you will achieve the same, plus he/she will learn some much needed motor skills as well. I was just so sad/disappointed when I played this for my baby, and I realized this was just using the TV as a babysitter and replacement for real learning activities. My advice, and an opinion I probably share with all of Europe, is to spend the money directly on some of good toys and music featured in this DVD"
2,great but broken,The product is a great learning tool for infants. It is also fine entertainment for little ones who cannot keep their eyes off it. The only problem is that this DVD came in broken. Since it was purchased as a gift and had to be replace in a timely fashion it became a total loss since returning would have taken too long.
1,Bach doesn't need any help reaching kids.,"In a certain sense, as a Bach fanatic, I support anything that exposes kids to his music. So my 1-star rating is a bit awkward in that light. However, I think it well worth pointing out that the music of Bach needs no video embellishment to captivate a child's attention. As a toddler, I was given cassette tapes of Bach's music, and listened to them constantly. In a very real sense, from about age 1 1/2 to 6 I lived *inside* the Brandenburg concertos, preludes, and fugues, and the immersive experience has irrevocably enhanced and deepened my perception and enjoyment of music to this day. So, consider allowing your child to focus on the marvelous harmonic intricacy of Bach without the concurrent distraction of an irrelevant stream of baby photos and implicit toy ads. Who knows? Maybe (s)he will grow up appreciating such music as more than mere auditory ""scenery"" (to which category Baroque music has largely been relegated in American society)."
1,Baby Bach is Bad,Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven are much better musically and visually than Baby Bach which is unfortunate because of the wonderful pieces that could have been used but were not.
5,my opinion,"My son, who is currently 3months old loves this video... we bought the video after seeing julie clark on Oprah. My son sits in his infant seat and will watch, coo, gurgle, and giggle along with this video. When I turn it on he is glued to the tv!! The music and kinetic objects in this video are great I have currently purchased an audio cd for him to listen when he goes down for a nap he absolutely loves then soothing sounds of the classical music...I think anyone who purchases this video will not be disappointed!!!!"
2,Not so great,"I bought Baby Einstein's Neighborhood Animals for my now 10 month old. She has enjoyed that DVD since she was about 7 months old and never grows tired of it. She cannot take her eyes off the TV when it's on and squeals everytime a new animal comes on. After that one was such a hit, we bought Baby Bach...it's okay, but not nearly the DVD that Neighborhood Animals is. My baby's interest in Baby Bach is nothing compared to the other. The objects used are just not as captivating and seem a little dull after the first couple of segments. My husband and I agree that it's pretty boring compared to what we got used to. Some babies may enjoy it, but this is the result at our house. Baby Galileo is a GREAT one too."
5,Best for infants,"The images and music here are great for 1-6 months. I suspect that, beyond that age range, it won't likely hold our child's attention for as long. Baby Mozart is a bit peppier and diverse, and Baby Neptune and Baby Van Gogh have more depth and breadth. Still, Baby Bach is where we started, and a good way to start the series. But if your child is already into some of the others, I don't recommend going back to this one."
2,Amateurish!,"My six-month-old and I had enjoyed a number of the Baby Einstein video titles, and the Baby Bach Concert for Little Ears was a naptime favorite. So the Baby Bach DVD seemed like a safe bet, and I bought it without looking at the reviews here. Mistake! I agree with the parents who were a little disturbed by the overexposure of little Aspen and Sierra, but I think the sound mixing bothered me even more. We'd seen the video several times before I could hear Sierra's riddle clearly enough to understand why those freakin' chickens keep showing up. (""Bach, Bach,"" nyuck, nyuck.) They don't seem to bother Six-month-old, though, and neither does the shoddy digital editing that makes the robots look so pixelley to me. In short, Baby says thumbs up, Mom tries not to pay attention when it's on."
2,Not worth it,"My daughter (12 months old) is a big fan of Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven, so I went out and bought Baby Bach and Baby Neptune. I was very disappointed by Baby Bach even though it seems to entertain my daughter for about 10-15 minutes. The excessive display of the children is annoying and seems to be the reason my daughter gets bored with the video. Baby Neptune is cute and I like it, but my daughter won't have anything to do with it. I'm hoping that the other Baby Einstein videos are better because I just bought Baby Van Gogh and Baby Neighborhood Animals for her 1st birthday.I also recommend the Brainy Baby series. The Brainy Baby Right Brain, Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven DVDs are my daughter's favorites."
1,"Put this one ""bach"" on the shelf ...please!","My 6 month old daughter adores the ""Baby Mozart"" video and we often have it on during dinner. It is nice to be able to sit and eat and listen to some pleasing music while the baby is entertained by the bright colors, interesting toys and soothing music.We were very disappointed with the ""Baby Bach"" video which was done by the same people. The musical selections are jarringly short and not particularly soothing. There is a loud and annoying chicken in the middle of the video and the originator's daughter telling goofy jokes. (Felt like I was watching someone's home movies.)So ... if you are interested in an entertaining video for your baby, I highly suggest purchasing ""Baby Mozart"" and leaving ""Baby Bach"" behind."
3,Disappointed in NJ,"My son LOVED Baby Mozart so I thought this would be similar. I think they were promoting their children too much to concentrate on the content of the video. It still has some great scenes, but they are combined with some awful scenes."
1,Too little Bach!,"My baby loves his Baby Mozart and his Baby Einstein videos, but he starts to cry after a few minutes of Baby Bach. This video seems to be an advertisement for toy companies rather than an attempt at entertaining babies. The toys shown move slowly and do not appeal to young babies. Also- where is the Bach music??? My baby is very fond of listening to Bach - but this video contains very little actual Bach music, and too many weird sound effects. The Bach music that is heard is so Disney-fied that it has little to do with Bach anymore. If Bach's music is as good for babies' deveopment as they are claiming at the end of the video - why not give the babis some actual Bach music?"
4,Fine investment,"My son really enjoys watching this video, and I think it's far superior to almost all of what's available on the television. I would suggest that if a parent wants the full developmental benefit, she has to sit with the child and participate in what's going on (as the makers of the video suggest).The only real drawback is that I don't approve of the way the older child is flattered on this video. She's encouraged to see herself as the ""star"" and gets big laughs for every comment she makes. I would hope most parents know better than to treat their kids this way- it does not lead to high self-esteem, only to a swollen head! But since she's only featured for about a minute of video time, it's not too big a deal.I will be investing in the DVD as a birthday gift to my son, and sharing it with my future kids. Worth the money!"
3,"good, but lacking something","I loved the story line to an extent. It seemed a little juvenile at times. And the character that doesn't have a leg, just doesn't seem realistic. It should have been introduced another way or something. I dont like how the ending TOTALLY left us hanging. However, I liked the book & am looking forward to the sequel."
2,JUST RUBBISH - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"PLEASE IF YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE THIS BOOK, PURCHASE IT USE. NIKKI TURNER SHOULD HAVE HER BOTTOM SPANKED FOR THIS TRASH."
2,Very Disappointed!,"I just finished reading the book, and was very disappointed with the ending. It was a rushed ending, and left you hanging -- no conclusion!! I was like this cannot be the end of the story, but yes, it was! Some of the story line seemed unrealistic and I would have liked more details. I truly hope there is a part 2 to this story."
2,So So,I am an avid Nikki Turner fan and have purchased all her books. This one however was a disappointment. Unlike her other books this one didn't seem like she put her heart into it or was maybe rushed to produce. I do plan on buying more books she writes just not any under G-Unit
5,"Loved It, Loved It, Can't wait for part 2","I really did like this book, I luv Nikki Turner and 50 Cent seems to amaze me with his talents. Yes the book did leave you hanging and wondering who told who, who did what, but that will make a wonderful sequel. There was a lot of questions not answered and I hope part 2 will do that. I am pleased and if you have not read the other two get them they are just as good if not better. I am a huge fan of G Unit Publications already."
3,Death Before Dishonor,"The overall storyline is good, however its much too short. You will enjoy this read if you like quick and straight to the point plots."
5,Yall Can't Leave Us Hanging!!!,"50cent/Niki yall simply did the dang gone thang!!!.. I'm sure Donald Goines has tipped his hat to you 50!!!..I read this book within 24hours. It read like an action packed made for t.v. movie. Hold up...is Trill dead or not??...You continue to put em out like this...I'm going to keep on buying em. And I'm not loaning them out...they gonna have to buy their own because I'm keeping these in a ""collection"". Hahahaha...50/Niki fill my collection!!...Well done..."
2,nikki with no Fifty,I love nikki turner and expected more from this book. It should have been have price since it only offered half of a story. The end came with no conclusion and it never fully developed the characters enough to care about what was going to happen. I'm willing to give part 2 a second chance maybe nikki turner can write it and leave Fifty Cent out of it.
3,"Run, Run, Run....","""Death Before Dishonor"" was a decent read. It started out with running and the running was so fast, the book was over before it began!!!The story needed more depth and more closure, but again, it was a decent read."
3,Sequel?,"This piece was written in 2007? Have I missed the sequel? ??? The overall plot, etc., is average to below-average. However, the characters are interesting. It would be good to know what happened next."
3,What ??,"I just finished this book , it was ok but It left me with allot of questions.It really could have been more to this story, This book reminded me of an short story instead of a novel . Maybe its going to be a sequel anyway I give it 3 stars out of five"
3,Not pleased,"I purchased this book because I love Nikki Turner and I just knew it would be a great read. While it had back to back action, it lacked substance. The book is really short, and things seem to happen in a span of three if not less days. And I was not pleased with the ending. The only way to save this book is to write a better sequel."
5,What is going on?,I really enjoyed this book. I read it in about 3 hours. It has got to be a part 2 to this because you all left us hanging in the end. But I must say this was truly a real good book.
2,I expect alot more,I read all the reviews for this books and was very disappointed after I bought and read it. Nikki Turner is a great writer and I wonder if this book was rushed or if this was a setup for a part two. Nikki always writes about things you know happen in the hood. But to many questions about the people and the reason for their actions. So either way I will not be buying another G Unit book. Though I will keep reading Nikki Turner because she is a great writer. I advise people who read comments before they buy books to look at the person's other reviews on books before you buy off their comments. I know I will from now on.
1,Nikki Turner...should have known better,"I am a big fan of Nikki Turner work. But Death B4 Dishonors was indeed the worst. No character development, absolutely no plot, and where was the reality...no where to be found. 50 cent should leave it alone."
1,mold on the bottom of the bowls,"The evening sun pattern is made out of something called 'earthenware' as compared to Stoneware. These have a greater tendency to absorb and keep water in the area on bottom where they are not glazed, and therefore will have a tendency to grow mold."
3,Not as bad as other reviews indicate,"I had to write this review to give a different take on this disc. First, this disc isnt Tosca strictly speaking. It's remixes of Tosca done by other artist. Second, those artists are hardly 'hack DJs' as one of the other reviewers wrote. So if you buy this disc expecting a Tosca album then you will likely be disappointed.That said, this is not the most compelling collection of remixes. Several quite good tracks, a few not so good, and the rest in the middle. Not the greatest but certainly not 1 star."
1,Save Your Money,"Having enjoyed much of Tosca's earlier works, I picked this up on faith. After listening to it, however, it's clear I made a big mistake. This is one of the worst albums I've heard in a long time. Tosca should be ashamed of themselves for attaching their name to a collection of dated, uncreative remixes by a bunch of hack DJs. As if to add insult to injury, their one ""new"" track on here is 9 seconds of silence. Unfortunately, I'm quite serious. It will hard for me to overlook this travesty of an album the next time a Tosca CD comes out."
3,Enjoyable,"Highly enjoyable collection of remixes. They aren't world class, but don't deserve one star either. I enjoyed the way the mixes deconstructed the original tracks and added humorous samples as well. Well worth checking out for the Tosca completist."
5,Great!,Shirley Jackson is one of my favorite authors. This book goes into many aspects of Jackson's life. Jackson was often times misunderstood and under appreciated. This author takes us back to the very beginning of Jackson's life to help us understand who she was and what had shaped her. This is a well written book and a must read for Shirley Jackson fans.
1,A disappointment,"I am surprised by the praise this biography has received. Shirley Jackson has been my favorite American author since the 1960s.... having reread her books almost yearly. But this biography was more of a tell all- yet never informed me about THE WRITING.... I learned nothing about the behind the scenes of the novels themselves, the motivations... I found it to be more of an intrusion in a Private Life."
4,Not Disappointed,Made with fairly sturdy construction and holds a good amount of clothes. Isn't flimsy like most other baskets out there and is easy to carry.
3,sturdy but small,For the price I expected a larger size. This is built well however not worth the money for its size. I would expect to pay around 7-8$ not 16!
1,Chamber of Horrors,"Timmy, the protagonist of this book is a 14-year-old boy serving time in a state institution which can best be described as a Chamber of Horrors.Why Timmy is serving time there is never explained; he does, however provide a poetic narrative that makes the stark horror of his environment even more poignant.Timmy is sexually abused in the institution; guards falsify his records so that he is placed on a mens' ward where he is used by inmates and staff alike.There are more questions than answers in this book, but one can say that sentiment applies to real life.The book is very upsetting and the writing does tend to ramble without remaining within a concrete framework. What ultimately cost this book some stars is that rambling writing style and the gaps in the telling."
5,One of those rare albums of perfect balance...,"It's difficult to review a CD that is, to me, above criticism. Allette's vocals are, as always, enchanting, the instrumentation is lush and seamless, and the songs themselves are small works of art.The political and the prosaic nestle side-by side in this album, as if they are littermates of some strange animal. ""Driving"" is the best song I have heard dealing with environmental issues, while ""Fireflies"" is a heart-felt glimpse into the heart of the Midwest. And of course, ""Okavango"" finishes the album in all of its leg-kicking glory.This is a deeply beautiful CD. I cannot believe that no one before me has written a review."
1,where is it?,I have yet to receive my copy of radio africa.You took my money but supplied no product.I would not recommend Amazon to any one--as it stands right now.Where is my copy of radio africa??????
5,The songs grow on you,"I find the more I listen to this CD, the more I like it. Get a copy of the lyrics to help you along and soon you will find yourself singing these songs and going over their meaning in your head."
4,how super rad,"The only reason I'd give this particular CD 4 stars is cause of how awesome it is to see First Grade Crush live. There's just so much energy put into it, both from the band and the enthused crowds. But this CD has a great variety of songs on it, and I just think you'll fall in love with it if their style is your thang. Over and Out! Go see em on tour with Big D and the Kids Table! mwuhahaha"
2,First Grade Crush better live,"In my humble opinion, I gotta give First Grade Crush props when they play live. Their set is very energetic. Though, I am not very impressed with the CD release, definitely I prefer to see these guys live."
5,Nuyork Latino,These guys are amazing. I saw them perform twice... once on summerstage in Central Park and again at the Bowery Ballroom. They work the crowd like I've never seen. These guys mix traditional Salsa and Caribbean beats with nuyorkino latino. Only New York can bring you something this cool.
3,"Great Concepts, TERRIBLE Code!","I bought this book in an effort to fully grasp and understand the basics of Isometric Game Programming. Well, it certianly helped with the concepts. The included code, on the other hand, is easily the WORST code I've ever looked at. Poorly commented, poorly structured... just about everything you can do to make code bad and unreadable is demonstrated in by this author.So to reiterate, the code is horrible but the concepts are sound. The book is written in a manner that is fun to read without the monotany of typical programming books. I certainly learned a lot and would recommend it to anybody who's interested in beginning programming with DirectX and Isometric Worlds."
4,"What it does, it does well.","This is a good beginners book. It covers just about every topic involved in creating an Isometric Game with DirectX 7.0. It also covers most of it's ""beginners"" topics fairly completely. It does not cover 3D graphics...it's not about 3d graphics. Having read the book cover to cover, I feel that I could write a simple Isometric Game with little difficulty. 4 stars instead of 5 because it was very much a beginners book. I feel it should have given less time to startup and more time to intermediate / advanced topics."
4,A Steep learning curve without prior WIN32 C++:,"If you have never done any C/C++ for WIN32, don't expect to know just what the heck Mr Pazera is talking about. Although, if you haven't any other books in your library related to _C/C++_Game_programming_, and are die-hard to learn ISO-HEX; start here - and STUDY LIKE CRAZY! By this I mean memorize the first few chapters. It is detrimental to the rest of the book. Although it's still best to start with some knowlege of C/C++; it's not imperative in this book if you are diligent. Have fun, enjoy, and Good Luck!:>"
1,I just want a book on isometric game programming,"This book devotes over 250 pages to windows and DirectX programming before it gets into the real reason why I bought it: isometric game programming. And then, much of the info on isometric game programming can be found on the web for free. If you want to learn windows programming, there are plenty of good books on that subject. There are also plenty of good books on DirectX programming. The information that this book provides is only worth about a fourth of what the book costs."
2,Not the greatest...,"This book gets you started with Direct Draw and Direct Input. In the beginning, it talks about using the Win API to do graphics programming. Unfortunately, that is the ONLY good part about the book, because the author gets into the details about whats going on.Things change when the author talks about how to use DirectX. Details are get more scarce as he gets deeper into the discussion. This left me hanging without a clue on some of the topics. Above all, there is only ONE chapter about creating games. The rest of the book lightly touches on DirectX's capabilities."
3,"Opera, Eyewitness Companions","I was struck by the lush lay-out of thisTurtleback book, the photos are breath taking.I have not read the book, merely I checked out a few articles here and there. I also discovered some mistakes, don't they have proof readers anymore? On page 383, they ""make"" Simon Estes a tenor(!), this artist is known all over the world as interpreter of Bariton or Bass-Bariton roles, from Hollaender to Porgy. When I see a mistake like this, I am hesitant to believe other information of the authors.The soprano on the front cover, I think it is Gianna Rolandi, but there is nowhere credit on the singer, also many pictures of opera houses give credit for the photographer but they don't list the place and name of the opera house. But the splendid pictures make this still an interesting joyable book."
3,DK Opera,Good for it' size but found a few grammatical errors and one photo error ( the caption of one picture says Placido Domingo and Mirella Freni )that definitely is not Freni regardless from which angle it was taken.
2,No screen protection,"Looks a very basic case. Why not having a ""hard side"" insert option, necessary to be used with the ipaq PocketPC?"
3,good book,"my wife loves CS Lewis and said ""uh...it's OK."" She said she would give it a three of five stars. So, hence the review. I wouldn't waste my time with it."
5,CS Lewis Weight of Glory,"Without doubt, one of the most explosive, thought provoking, conscience stirring piece of Christian writing I have ever read. CS Lewis has this uncanny ability to mix arts and science, to allow his emotions to flow and yet at the same time able to express it precisely. He is able to paint like an artist, whilst at the same time write as a learned professor. A must read for all !!"
4,Weight of Glory,His work is hard to read but if you can endure it has great rewards! His faith is amazing and so genuine.
5,A C.S. Lewis must!,"This is one of C.S. Lewis' least known works , but so very powerful. It moves the reader to a new perspective. The Weight of Glory is a classic even for the 21st century."
5,Lewis at top notch...,"This volume contains nine of Lewis' brilliant essays. Every one of them is full of the flawless reasoning you can expect from anything by Lewis. Topics range from ""Why I am not a Pacifist"" to forgiveness, with a clear message delivered in each. A couple that particularly stand out are ""Transposition"", which helps to make clear why we can't understand very much about the supernatural in our current state, and ""Is Theology Poetry?"" which, despite the title, ends with a wonderful bit about why the beliefs of Christianity truly are superior to other world views. Definitely get your hands on this great set of essays."
5,Great book!!!,This is a great book and I recieved it within the said timeline. The price was good and I am enjoying CS Lewis's great writing
1,Avoid,These tend to shed their material with any kind of active use (like sports). They leave bits of material all over you.
3,Poor first talkie vehicle for Josephine Baker,"A more extensive review of mine appears on the imdb. This isa poor film by any standards. The sound is not very good andthe editing is very choppy and crude. Acting is merelyacceptable and the Baker mystique does not translate well tothe screen in this-her first talkie (she had made one silentin 1927, of which only three reels survive). Kino's sourcematerial is of a lower standard than their usual pristinearchive prints - there are lines, jumps and focus problems. Itmay have been the only print available at the time.This then is a mixed bag- interesting for historical purposesand for those fans of Ms. Baker's vocal recordings. She onlymade four films and only three talkies are available on video.Other films in her imdb filmography consist of musical sceneslifted from the four core films."
5,Great all around!,"My son picked this story to donate to his class for his birthday book. The characters, especially Gloria the dog are so funny. A book both child and adult will enjoy together."
4,"Works as needed, but","I guess for the price I should be happy. The only issue I had was threading the coax cable line onto the adapter. The threads are plated, so it makes screwing the coax cable on more difficult. Works just as I had expected though and once installed, there were no issues."
5,Busy grandma,Found one of these in use in a hotel. pefect for tight spaces. I ordered two they came promptly we are using them and givng other the inf on where to get one .
5,Works Perfect,Works Perfect. Before buying this my cable would stick out around 4-5 inches from the wall. Everyone would kick it when walking near it. Not anymore with this nifty little item.
5,Works great,"Needed to use one of these when mounting a flat panel tv on the wall in our bedroom. Connector comes straight out the back of the TV instead of pointing downward, so we needed one of these. Can't believe that new TVs aren't made with the connectors pointed downward now that everyone is mounting their TVs on their walls. At least someone thought to make these."
1,The center pin comes out,i bought this to tidy up my cables and works great. after using it for 1 week i foundout that my receiver was not getting signals. when i inspected the center pin was shakey and came out. save your money.
3,Works,"The adapter works just fine, that isn't why I marked it down. I marked it down because it still juts out quite a ways. I bought this, because I hung out TV on the wall, and it lays pretty flush. I wanted a right angle adapter so the coax cable wasn't sticking straight into the wall.Now that it is installed I have the flat edge of the adapter sticking straight into the wall. I guess that's still better than ruining my coax cables."
1,Fell apart immediately,"There's little good to say. I guess it didn't cost much. Piece of crap fell apart literally 30 seconds after it came out of the box. It's made of brass and not steel or something harder which I guess doesn't help (come to think of it, that's not what's shown in the picture...) I took it out, attached it to the outlet, then to the cable. The minute I let go of the cable, the whole thing fell apart and I had to remove what was left of it from the jack with pliers. Then I went to the corner hardware store instead, picked up the exact same thing (except in steel) for $2.99 (this is $4.99 after shipping) and it's held up fine for the last week in the exact same setup. Not recommended."
5,"It's hard to get excited about this item, but...","It's hard to get excited about a co-axial Type F adapter, but the item arrived as expected and does what it is supposed to do.Thanks!"
5,"Not just for fibro families, but for everybody","I read an excerpt from this book in a magazine, and knew that I had to buy this book. Mr. Piburn has written a brilliant book about what can happen when fibromyalgia, a very misunderstood and mis-diagnosed disease, enters your family. Fibromyalgia can destroy a family -- I've seen it all too often.Mr. Piburn's journey has been a difficult one, and I applaud him for writing this book. I think that this book is useful not just for fibro families, but for anyone who has a loved one suffering from a chronic condition or disease.I cannot think of enough superlatives to describe this book -- you will have to read it for yourself to find out.Thank you, Mr. Piburn, for being so honest and brave enough to write this book. And, also to the Piburn family. I am going to recommend this book at my next support group meeting."
5,Honestly written!,This is one of the best books on how people cope with Fibro that I have read. This man is honest about how he feels and how he struggles in his role as caretaker of an ill spouse. It helped give me insight into what my husband must go through in helping to keep me sane and well as this illness steals both our lives.
5,This one's for everyone!,"Although this book was obviously written for people who have loved ones with chronic illness, it's message would benefit everyone. This book is really about communication and relationships. It's about how to move your relationships to a higher level of trust and understanding. Anyone who is in a relationship, a family, or any type of community would greatly benefit from reading this moving, yet humorously presented, story. This author has opened his heart and soul for all of us to learn. Excellent!"
3,"Nice, but he must be a saint...","As the husband of a person with chronic illness, I thought I might find some great insight and perspective that might lead me to a different path of thought or feeling. Didn't happen here.While I agree that to a large part his attitude is great (almost saintly if you ask me) what I really didn't see in this was someone who really, really was real. While it definitely comes from a unique experience for material in this area, it still leans more toward the standard stuff on the subject.IMHO, if this is the worst reaction(s) he ever had, then I want what he is taking.Its a good book, if you have a life more Cleaver then Simpson. Unfortunately, most of us live in another world. Thanks Gregg, for writing the book. Guess I'll have to write one myself..."
3,Beyond Chaos,Book is (346 pages)of decent information about a spouse/caregiver's journey with an illness. Sometimes difficult to follow what the author was trying to get the reader to see. Good conversational tone. Good section on intimacy.
4,My daughter love it,My daughter love this perfume. She is 15 and says that many of her friends (male and female) ask her about the aroma.Will keep buying it
1,disappointed,I've been wearing Stella for years & love it. But when I received this shipment I was very disappointed. It didn't smell like it was supposed to.
5,Good for older ladies,It is not an young girl's perfume and that is strictly IMHO. I would rate it for ladies 35+ years.So do check it out in a store before you decide to order one online for your partner.
5,Easy to use and very subtle,"I bought this without smelling it, and it was a treat. Nice and soft, and the roll on ball is metal and doesn't stick. Very easy to apply and nice to bring with you if you want a touch up."
3,Not what I expected,"I thought I was buying Stella's Peony perfume, but that is not what I got. The bottle looks the same as the Peony I purchased at a Saks few years ago, but (again) that is not what I got. This version smells fine (not as good as Peony), but the scent dissipates quickly and does not linger on you skin."
1,NOT HAPPY,THIS PRODUCT WAS SHIPPED TO ME OPEN. I DON'T THINK IT WAS THE ORIGINAL EITHER. WON'T BE BUYING FROM HERE ANYMORE.
3,Not Compelling to Me,"Stella is a pretty, throwback rose that has crystalline & modern qualities. It's a bit too sweet, too thin, and too fruity for me. Stella is on the edge of cloying, yet doesn't hold well, which is rare a combination imo.Overall, I think Stella is similar to Cabaret (longer lasting, more complex) and Ellen Tracy Peony & Rose (prettier peony), both of which I prefer to Stella. I'd love to sample Stella side-by-side with Lancome's 'Mille et Une Roses,' as @soirdelune suggests.There's no compelling reason for me to add Stella to my collection, and I love both peonies and roses! I'm surprised. I really thought I'd love this one before testing. After testing, I know that I don't even like it."
5,Bradygames does it again,"Awesome strategy guide! Between Bradygames and Prima, nobody else can make strategy guides like them. All full color, maps, and tons of useful information. If you are like me and like to find everything in the game you can't go wrong with this guide."
5,My Son thinks it's great,He's 10 and thihs book helped him get more ouf the game (which he probably should'nt have anyway).
1,COMPLETELY USELESS!!!!!!!!!,The only way this book will be even remotely helpful to you is if you have absolutely no idea as to what the ACT and SAT test are. This book gives general information that you could find for free on any number of websites or from having a 10 minute talk with your counselor. The strategies it contains are the same basic ones inside every test prep book on the market. This book has no value whatsoever. I strongly suggest not buying it.
4,clever songwriter/straightforward alt-country,"There's some great tunes on this. On ""I'll Take a Tuesday"", the chorus gets me every time. For anyone coming out of a relationship or trying to get into one, this album will hit a lot of right chords."
4,Great True Crime Story! Don't Miss This One!,LOVE IS BLIND AND DANGEROUS makes you aware of the need to thoroughly investigatge the person you are dating. You might be very unpleasantly surprised if that person turns out to be one of these psychopaths...but at least you will live to tell about it! Signed: Audrey Hayes
5,A Mass from a Glorious Period in English Music,"This ""Old Man"" mass (the old man is Adam) comes from a flourishing period of English music when English sacred music spread widely over the European continent. In addition to the ordinary of the mass, which is beautifully sung, this recording includes numerous examples of Sarum chant, some of which are still used in Anglican and Roman Catholic churches today. This is the fifth volume of a series by the Gothic Voices titled ""The Spirits of England and France"" -- every volume in this series is fascinating. The recording booklet is a model of what documentation should be for music of this era."
2,What a horrible novel!,"[...]. Our class had to read this book, and we all hated it. We all agreed that this was one of the worst books we've ever read. This novel has no real plot, no action--nothing really at all except teenage angst. Not that good teenage angst, either, but boring angst! It was really hard to get through since I didn't want to read any further. This book would probably be something interesting for a 10 year old, but I'm not so sure that many people older than that would find this interesting."
3,The middle of three Morris Bird III books: the least success,"The book deals with the years between the first of the three books in this series, ""The Greatest Thing Since Sliced Bread"" and acts more as a passage between them, explaining Morris Bird III's family. It is relationship driven but important to understand the entirety of Morris' character. Very important to read it in order."
2,Not our favorite puzzle,"This brand of puzzle isn't very well made, but this bus is the worst of the puzzles we own. The main problem with it is that the pieces aren't cut out in a logical manner. Several of the pieces are very similarly shaped and can be interchangeable. There are several odd pieces which are good to challenge an older child, but may not make sense to a child in the age range that typically are using wooden puzzles."
4,My 2-year old enjoys this puzzle,"My two year old loves puzzles, but can't yet do jigsaws. She has a few puzzles from when I was a kid that are similar to this, where the object in the picture is cut out, for example the wheels, the door, etc of this bus.The quality is only okay. The ones I had as a kid were nice solid wooden pieces with no sharp or rough edges. This puzzle looks as if it was just cut out with a jigsaw and then packaged. I really wish the pieces were sanded.Also, the wheels don't seem to fit nicely without a little bit of twisting, or switching the front and rear wheels. This frustrates my toddler.If the puzzle were higher quality, I would be extremely happy, especially because puzzles of this style are difficult to find.I also bought the fire truck and cow made by Schylling."
5,Get an 89!,"This calculator is awesome. I used it in both AP Calc AB and AP Phy C last year and it is awesome. I could go on and on about the features of this calculator. The calculator is allowed on all AP tests and the SAT, but is not allowed on the ACT (you won't need it, anyway). Just don't tell your teachers about the calculator, they might ban it!"
3,"It's OK, but it's not HP 49G (Naval Architecture student)","I had HP48GX, and when i heard of HP 49G i wanted to buy it at once. But first i looked up on the net for some competition and all i could find was TI89. Finally I went to some electronic store to check both out and talked with my friends. The conclusion is: TI89 is not really the competition for HP49G!(Check the specs over the net + tons of software & enough memory to load it in, Great Linear algebra & calculus, symbolic, numerical ...)"
4,GREAT---but not for stats,"I agree with all of the positive comment about the TI-89 listed in other comments BUT...if you need a calculator for stats this is not the one. Sure it will do some basic operations but will not do some really important things, such as t-tests, etc. If you need a calculator for stats get the TI-83 or TI-83 PLUS. These two calculators have everything you need for stats and most stats books teach to students that have the TI-83."
1,Piece of junk...,"I am fairly certain all the glowing reviews of this product are from employees or paid hacks. This thing is a piece of junk, I am curious how much TI pays college professors to force us to buy these difficult to read, poorly documented, over priced hunks of crap. The display is unreadable unless you have a huge light directly over the display even then it sucks, especially compared to the displays available in other small hand held devices, like my iTouch or cell phone. The quality of the documentation is so convoluted and cryptic that it is all but unusable. Don't waste your money on this if you can get away with using a laptop and excel or other software."
1,it is acturally not the one it looks to be,"It somehow misleads customers, the picture doesn't fit with the calculator that the seller is selling. The seller is actually TI-89 Titanium.If you are looking for Ti-89 Advanced calculator, you won't get what you want."
3,It looked great...,"but of course it was to good to be true. I tried to work it but it was confusing and when I figured out how to work it, it didnt work. It was not worth my money. If you really need a calculator just get one for 20 bucks!"
1,DON'T GET THIS CALCULATOR,This calculator is where I went wrong. It was the worst thing that ever happened to me. My IQ dropped significantly from this damn thing. It does everyrthing for you and you turn into a calculator nerd and it washes your brain and takes over your mind. I flunked out of AP Calculus and High School (I was valedictorian going into my senior year) It took all my time. Just stay away from it!
5,the best college calculator,i bought this for my daughter for college and its basically the best calculator you can own for this purpose. the new titianium model just seemd to have a clock and a card slot to add more to it with. i am very happy with this model
5,"In some highschools, ti-89 is NOT allowed in class!","Yes, it does have wonderful features but you ""MUST!!!""consider this if you are a highschool student.I am taking AP calculus in highschool and Ti-89 was NOT allowedto use during class and tests.I ordered this calculator before the class started,and I will have to return it.So... just be aware.If you really want this calculator (as a highschool student)consult with your math teacher before you get it."
5,I love this calc,"This calculator is worlds ahead of both the TI-83 and TI-86.For the most part, the calculator is pretty intuitive. After 10 or 15 minutes, you get the hang of it and can pretty much do everything you could do with the other TIs.Of course, that's just the tip of the iceberg. The CAS (computer algebra system) is great. You can take derivatives or integrals of functions of one (or more) variables. If you don't have caluclus, you can factor or expand expressions, which is great for avoiding tedious algebra.If you're into programming, you can find some great resources for programming it in C, or use the BASIC-like language built in to the calculator. With the built-in language, you can create both programs and functions that return values just like built-in functions.I feel that I must address a common complaint. I didn't notice the screen being tilted or at an angle, even upon close inspection."
1,This calculator is just for kids.,"When I started studying engineering in college I purchased a TI 89 because of the fancy reviews I read here, Afther taking my first calculus exam I changed my mind and changed it for an HP 49, the HP 49 is definitely made for engineers. With the TI you only get answers for exams but wiht the HP you get all the steps and it is as easy to use as a TI."
3,A calculator that is to good,"For computation ability this thing does deserve 5 stars, but this thing makes you dumb if you use it. I used to be a great math student then I started relying on this dumb black box and I have problems with even simple things like the quadratic formula(ok maybee not stuff that simple, but you get the point). Perhaps losing a $150 adding machine was the best thing that ever happened to me, now i'm starting to learn how to do this stuff with my own calculator (the human brain). I really reccomend that you only use this calculator on tests or quizzes, for everything else like home/class work just use a scientific. Trust me on this one ok guys.LOOK OUT GUYS I'M BACK! (guys being the other students in my math class)."
2,"Great tool, but craftmanship is poor","Believe me I love his calculator for all it cando. But unfortunetly it is not built well enough. The LCD screen on my calculator cracked spilling the blue fluid inside my calculator. Ironically, it fell while my case was ON."
1,"Don't be taken in by the ""hype"", get an HP","I am a college engineering student and I use an HP 48G. It can do a ton more than the TI's, and once you get past the ""tricky"" command format, which so many people are threatened by, it is a lot more convenient than any calculator on the market. If you are serious about a calculator, and aren't just looking for one with cool games to play in your high school classes, get a calculator you can use after graduation. Go with an HP."
1,lcd resolution does not last,"Disappointed to find out that after about two months of use, the calculator's lcd screen resolution is fading. this is not due to the batteries, as i have tried placing new batteries in the calculator. This is really frustrating because i have a calculus final within a week. I would not recommend buying from this seller."
4,Great Tool for math,I love this product. Its helped me a lot on my Linear Algebra and Differential Equation courses. Though I am having trouble with the software downloads.
5,Lovin it,"The TI-89 is the best graphing calculator available. I've used the TI-83 plus and the 89 is far better. In my opinion the 89 is easier to use. The 89 is really helpful for those who plan to or are taking calculus. It can find limits, derivatives, and integrals of functions. Highly recommended!!!"
5,A Calculus Student Must-have,"This Calculator absolutely does it all! It's ability to find derivatives and antiderivatives (which the TI-85 cannot do) as well as many other calculus functions is invaluable. In calculus, I was always far ahead of my class due to this calculator! In statistics, its tables and graphing is extremely easy to use and its statistical summaries are much easier to access and read than those of the 83 or 85. The pretty print feature makes finding mistakes and reading the answers much easier. The graphs (3D) are far superior to that of the TI-83 or 85. I would recommend this calculator over the 92 for high school students due to the fact that the TI-92 (with its QWERTY keyboard) is not allowed on the SAT I or II tests or AP tests. The TI-89, with very similar operation and features, is allowed on these tests. For more information...e-mail me."
4,A great calculator—available at a great price…,"I have used several graphing calculators in the past several years, including the TI-82, TI-83, TI-83 Plus, and an older HP calculator.This calulator has great features—it's extremely easy to use with pull-down menus and many shortcut keys, and it has power to do much more complex problems than any calculator I've tried, with the possible exception of the HP. It is exactly the same as the TI-92 Plus—it even has the same manual. There are two small differences—the 92-Plus has a qwerty keyboard and the ability to do geometry. Unless these are extremely important to you get the 89.On the downside, I was disappointed to find that it does not have sound…or if it does, I haven't heard it yet. It is advisable to be careful of third-party games—the more complex the calculator, the easier it is for something to go wrong, and I have had to reset my memory once. If you have important info on your calculator, BACK IT UP before installing a new game."
3,Texas instruments TI-89,"I am not commenting on the all TI-89 ,i rather like to comment on the particular item i ordered, there was a difference on the picture and the actual item i recived the seller don't accept that there was some dispute between the seller and me,the seller was not willing to accept the return policy,thanks to amazon i get my money back and returned the item.i like to thanks Amazon i always proud of them it is a right choose for me to use Amazon market place with confidence.thank you."
5,Great Product,This calculator works very well for the courses I am using it for. It has many applications in calculus and trigonometry and despite its age is a great product.
5,"Very powerful, easy to use","When I bought this calculator, I already knew what to expect about it's power, but I was really expecting it to be complicated to use. For a very advanced calculator, it is actual rather intuitive in it's use, at least as far as basic functions go. I have not yet tried programming it, but I have programmed some other models which was easy enough once getting used to the syntax. The graphing functions are fairly straight forward."
5,Very powerful,"We have all of these calculators TI-84, TI-82 and TI-89 in our house. In my opinion, TI-89 is much easier to use and far more powerful. Solving and factoring equations, manipulating matrices are significantly easier than others. I also have not seen binary calculation capabilities in TI-84 or 82.The only reason that we have other calculators in our house is because TI-89 is not allowed in ACT and most schools work with their students on TI-84."
1,"Great Features, Poor Craftsmanship","I use to own the original TI-83 and it was great. Recently it finally busted and I figured I'll replace it with a TI-89. So I buy the TI-89 and noticed 4 things:1) Great features! So many potantials.2) Cheap plastic compared to some of the older models.3) LCD directly exposed; unlike the TI-83(original) which had a transparent plastic shield over the display.4) Display is skewed by roughly 1 degree clockwise...which is VERY annoying.I am very disappointed at Texas Instrument's poor quality control. For a product that costs so much, the last thing I expected was poor craftsmanship. Don't get we wrong; the features on the TI-89 are top notch! I would give a 5 star rating for features alone. But a skewed display is just insulting for [an expensive] calculator.Sorry but Texas Instruments just lost a long-time customer.Buyer's beware: always check the quality of the TI-89 you're getting."
2,Math illiteracy made possible by Ti89.,If you buy this calculator your going to cheat your self out of learning the beauty of mathmatics. I purchased the Ti89 a year ago having used a Ti85 for the last 5 years. I am currently a chemical engineering student taking Vector Calculus and Numerical Analysis II along with Thermodynamics. For the past year I have become so dependent on this calculator that I actually carry a package of backup batteries in my backpack. I feel that I'm cheating on ever test that I take and I'm getting scared that my teachers are becoming suspicious of my Ti89 crutch through a lack of visable work.
1,the item,the item was not in good condition. there was no battery and connectors. most of the faces are scratched and also on the corners of the screen are scratchedhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B00000JF55/ref=dp_olp_used?ie=UTF8&condition;=used
1,Bad experience with old model TI-89,"This is and old model, not the recent TI-89. The screen is not in good conditions and the graphics does not look clearlyI wish I could get back my money!"
2,Great for kids but...,"This calculator will do well for students who are doing homework for their lower level classes but for the professional, the HP 49GX or HP49G is superior, both in terms of capability and product quality. As a chemical production engineer, I had a TI-89 until a fall from my desk left it dead. Since I had used an HP 41CV in school, I decided to replace it with an HP 48GX. Since that time I have noticed that ALL of my professional colleagues use HP calculators. Since that time, my HP has survived bumps, falls, and even complete submersion in water and still works as well as the day I purchased it.If you are a high school student and looking for a calculator for math class, buy the TI. On the other hand, if you are an engineer, or a student who wants to learn engineering on the calculator you will use once you are a professional, get the Hewlett Packard."
5,THE LIVE EXPERIENCE OF KAZANTZIDIS,"Yes, this is an incredible album, which contains 2 fantastic CD's full of Greek folk songs, which are sung by the marvellous voice of Stelaras!The album's old name is 'Ena glenti me to Stelara"". The company is his last one, Music Box International.Listen and relax!"
2,"Too much, for too little","Not much space, quality not that good. You can get it for $35.00 lessfrom another amazon dealer at Jed mart for $25.00"
5,"Great product, great seller.","Functional and adorable as well--an excellent product! Contrary to one of the reviews I saw, I had no trouble with the suction cup, it worked perfectly. Customer service from Touch of Europe is excellent, too. They are fast and courteous and we've been happy with every purchase. Highly recommended!"
2,suction bowl doesn't stick,"Although the bowl is very cute, the suction cup base is almost flat and therefore doesn't suction well. It doesn't stick unless the surface is very hard and smooth like a marble countertop. It won't stick to our wooden dining table and slides around on my daughter's highchair tray."
3,Attractive but small and poor suction,Purchased this item. It came from Touch of Europe. It was packaged nicely and is very attractive but was smaller than expected. The problem is that it does not suction well at all. It would not suction well even when the suction cup was wet to the high chair tray or to the wooden dinner table. It suctioned just fine to the kitchen counter - but that's not where the kids eat. :-)We ended up returning the item at our expense (understandable) and the vendor indicated initially a 20% restocking fee and was actually pretty snotty about it all.The item is attractive but you mayfind it does not suction well which was the entire point. But it could have just been us. But we did order three different bowls each with a different design (we have triplets) and all performed the same - so I suspect it is the nature of the product.
2,hmmm...,"right i seriously did not enjoy this dvd at all. this is the 1st metal fest dvd i have ever seen. and will probably be the last. well till hellfest 2003 comes out. but any way, none of the bands played amazing, as there was little crowd participation which makes bands usually play better. just been able to see a life once lost and the lamb of god wall of death (which will be a lot better on hellfest 2003 dvd) were probably best bits on dvd. unless you are some silly little girl who drools all over eighteen visions, or you went to the fest and wana see yourself in the crowd. i would not recomend this dvd at all!!"
2,where is my atreyu!!!!?,"i bought this for 3 reasons : atreyu , lacuna coiland bleeding through . i can't find atreyu . onthe track selection i saw on bestbuy.com it saidthat there were 2 live atreyu songs . it's supposedto come after the bleeding through clips but i can't findit. where is it??? please help me . the first reviewer said atreyu was onbe of the highlights but i can't find itplease help me out . they are my faverite band .tell me at papamoach@hotmail.comoh yeah lacuna coil rocked!! cristina is real cutebleeding through was ok"
5,Condensed version of the full-length hardcover,"A concise ""Mysterious William Shakespeare"", completed by Ogburn himself. For those who don't have the time or inclination to read the big one, but who still need to be enlightened about the Authorship Question. Highly recommended."
1,Conventional Gear: Flying A Taildragger,"Only a small portion of this book pertains to ""Flying a Taildragger"". Most of the book is of a general nature that is not taildragger specific, therefore, I feel the title is misleading. If the reader is looking for a thorough intro into the operation of conventional gear aircraft, look elsewhere, you will not find it here. Based on the title, this book is a waste of money."
3,"A Good Resource, but not for the novice.","Robson's book has excellent information on flying specific aircraft, especially pertaining to the UK and other European countries. As an experienced pilot, I found much of his aircraft specific information to be excellent and his conversational style of writing approchable. I don't think the new student would appreciate this book until he or she has flown more than one type of tail dragger. But there is a great deal of useful information contained therein. I would recommend Sparky Imeson's ""Taming the Taildragger"" to beginners and advanced students as well. Or Harvey P'sThe Compleat Taildragger PilotHappy tail wagging!"
2,Good Ashtray,"Good Cigar ashtray, I used it for mainly churchills and robustos. Fits excellent. Downside: The material is not very durable, i.e. delicate to scracthes and shocks. Some parts of the brown/black edges got teared up/scraped."
3,"Inferior to BOOGIE WOOGIE CHRISTMAS, But Still Pleasant","I'm not sure why the earlier review mentioned how ""disappointing"" Setzer's first Christmas album, BOOGIE WOOGIE CHRISTMAS, was. It seemed to be well received by listeners and sold well, leading to the fairly quick sequel we have here. Frankly, maybe it's because I'm not YET in the mood for Christmas, but this sequel album isn't anywhere near as good: too many frenetic tracks, not enough pause to soak up the season and meaning of Christmas. ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" is marvelous, but tracks like ""Let It Snow!"" are redundant and ultimately tiresome. It's like hearing the same arrangement over and over. No doubt there's more ""rockin'"" on this album compared to the original, but I liked the balance of songs better on Setzer's first Christmas take. Recommended for the most part, but go with the original album first."
3,Brian Setzer Orchestra - 'Dig That Crazy Christmas' (Surfdog),"The former Stray Cats frontman had sure made a second career out of his making CD's that feature that 'big band' sound.I usually don't care for Christmas albums,of ANY kind.But,I thought I'd borrow a friend's copy to see what it was like.Sort of took notice on cuts here like ""Dig That Santa Claus"",""Let It Snow!Let It Snow!Let It Snow!"",""Hey Santa"" and his holiday tribute to Glenn Miller,with ""Getting In The Mood""-even though I thought this track was a bit corny,it still showcases Setzer's talent.Heard that his 'Christmas Extravaganza' DVD is really good.Obviously,Stray Cats die-hards and Xmas music completists should get more out of this CD than I did.Might make a nice gift for an old school fan."
4,Very Happy,I am very pleased with my crystal bible. It is very easy to read--and the pictures help lots!! Great purchase!!
5,better than i expected,"i was going to get this thru one of those book clubs, but never did....but needed a really great book on crystals and rocks and so since i'd read good stuff about it in the book club reviews, i thought i'd check it out here and it got great reviews, so i went ahead and got it as well as two other books on crystals just to be on the safe side and as most people know, no two books about the same thing are exactly the same, so i figured the more the better...well, to get to the point, this book is good enough to stand on it's own....but if you still want go for getting another just for the extra possible info and pix....i try to have at least two on everything, but as i've said, this one is good enough to be on it's own....it's also a great size, it's thick, but it's is small enough to stuff into a carry-on or a large purse and not take up too much room... i love it!!!! this one will sit on my desk and not be stuffed in the bookcase!!"
5,Possibly the only Crystal guide you'll need.,"I bought this book because I didn't know a thing about crystals and was interested in finding out what they were and how they work. This guide was very helpful in that it has great pictures and information. The pictures are so good that I was easily able to identify two crystals that I had.Like other 'Bible' definitive guides, it's put together nicely. I noticed on the back of the book that the author Judy Hall has thirty years experience. Good to know that the person who wrote this is so well qualified.The 'Quick Reference' in the back of the book is neat because it gives you information on crystals and the zodiac, the chakras, the aura, and correspondences which has to do with balancing body parts, and divinatory meanings.This is a great reference guide. It gave me the information I needed to know, and more. I don't feel like I would need to buy any other Crystal guides unless I decided to further study them in depth."
1,"For ""believers"" only.","This book is for believers only. Not in any way a science text. There are factual errors. There are no clues how the author comes up with healing properties. No studies, methodology, or evidence of research. The author does not give an adequate explanation of who she is, where this ""knowledge"" comes from, education, anything. I was wondering if this book was defective. Missing a chapter on research, bibliography, or anything that could breathe life in to so many unfounded statements. Apparently not. Some will believe anything. It's an intelligence test."
3,A Fools Guide to Crystals Real and Fake To Make Idiots Believe,"Ok, I don't believe one iota in the healing powers of crystals so this book was definitely not for me. But I use it to sell the jewelry we make to prove to the idiots who do believe that they will be cured of whatever ails them if the buy the right jewelry with the right crystal. Here is an example of one item in the book...excuse the spelling, Azezutlite: a crystal with incredible powers...it is the biggest ripoff in the crystal buying world, i.e. selling at incredible prices when in reality it is only plain old quartz...but it is listed in this book...anyway you know why I bought it..."
4,A Gem Of A Book,I love Judy Hall's The Crystal Bible. Everything you need is contained into one book. Unlike Melodies where you have to buy more than one book. Plus I like the small size. I can carry it practically anywhere. The only thing I do wish is that she would have put in this book whether or not you use the direct or indirect method when using the remedies. In one of her other books that I have she tells you how to do the direct or indirect method and I would have liked to know which one to use for what remedy. That is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five.
5,Great for beginners.............,"This is a great book for beginners, like me, who are trying to learn the basics of crystals and their abilities. This book has alot of pictures too which is nice. Easy to understand as well. I highly recommend it."
3,A Reference Book for Crystals,"This is a picture book of rocks and gems. But not ALL rocks and gems. I have not found one that big and complete. You'll have to do as I have done, buy several books for your rocks and gems reference library. You should have this one in your reference library. It is as it is titled -- a book specifically dealing with rocks and gems known as ""Crystals."" If your curiosity gets the better of you, buy it. It'll answer some of your questions, but not all of them. That's the reason for the other books."
3,"Ok for beginners, but should not be relied upon","Having experience with Melody's Crystal Healing and her book ""Love is in the Earth,"" I have found that this book is OK for people beginning to work with crystals and stones, but that it has a lot of misinformation. For example, Carnelian DOES NOT cleanse other stones. Only Selenite can do that. Don't rely totally on the information in this book. If you want the definitve, go to Melody."
4,Excellent Information,This book contains a great deal of information on the general rocks and crystals. It isn't real in depth on rare crystal and rock formations but is a good advanced beginner to mid level intermediate rock and crystal metaphysical learner.
5,WONDERFUL!,I love this book! It's got everything you'd need to know from a scientific and spiritual standpoint. Highly recommend this book to anyone!
5,Perfect!!!!,"This was my first book purchase for crystals. It is perfect for what I was looking for being a beginner. Easy to read, gives reason and purpose of crystals and helped me identify crystals with the pics. I love it! Have another crystal book but I really really love this book!"
4,The Crystal Bible,Pretty comprehensive and easy to use. I wish there were a little more info on crystal gridding but definitely worth purchasing if you are interested in knowing the healing qualities of the most available crystals out there.
5,The Crystal Bible,"I Loved it, it has a lot information about most of all the stones, crystals and their properties of healing and well being. very good book."
3,A good place to start.,"I'm new to learning about crystals and their meanings. I had seen this book in metaphysical shops and after seeing the price on here, I made the purchase.It's a pretty good book for beginners I think. But, after looking in it, I have to keep in mind that there is a lot of 'fluff' and parts that really don't resonate with me personally.The photos are gorgeous in here!I'm not sure I would purchase this again. I wish I had done more homework about this book before buying it."
2,Book was ripped and looked used,Cute small little book but there was a tear going through the cover and a few of the pages and the binder was all scratched. I couldn't return it because it was a gift. Disappointing because the book itself seems interesting...
3,"Hate to slam this, but....","This book is really helpful for you if you already know what crystals you have in your collection, or if you just want to know the corresponding chakras or different uses. However, I bought this to help me identify a huge bag of crystals I bought and it fell short. The images are pretty hard to see, there should be more images of the different variations an agate can come in for example. It should have its original form, colored form, tumbled form etc. The index is pretty hard to use and not ""idiot"" proof. They fail to mention some major crystals that are out there and are just as important as a snowflake obsidian for example. If you know what you have, this book is very helpful, but if you're not an expert, probably not the cheapest and not the easiest book to get."
5,I Love My Grandma!,FAST SHIPPING. The puppet got her so quickly. I was shocked when it arrived! I'm in love with this puppet. I've named her Grandma Jones. She's a feisty little thing! Everyone said that she's cute. I think so too. You won't be disappointed with this puppet. Enjoy!
1,Snap fell apart,The first time I opened the snap compartment one of the snaps fell apart. I was also disappointed in the size and usability of the outside pocket. If you want to carry a few extra SD cards and maybe one credit card then the pocket is fine. I was hoping to carry my license four credit cards and possibly a few dollars. This will not work for that.
2,Will not fit with strut bars!,"The description had no warnings that this part will not fit with SE-Rs and Spec Vs, as those cars have strut bars and the bolt that goes through the strut bar is not long enough. I went all over town looking for a longer exact bolt but could not find one to no avail. I'm sure this will fit for any of the other models (GE, GXE, etc) except for SE-R and Spec Vs. Beware."
4,Decent,"With enough new ideas and plot to pass off as another book. This book twists Ender's Game's views a little, but not in a bad way. I liked Ender a lot more in this book than I did in Ender's Game.The book starts off very interesting, but has a slight downward slope as the plot begins to merge with the exact same events of Ender's Game and is simply re-told.Still a good read, but not as exciting as Ender's Game, in my humble opinion."
