5,Excellent,"This is perfect for my kitchen. I am not tall and can now reach all my upper cabinets. The stool rolls around, so I don't need to have my hands free to move it in place or out of the way!"
4,love it,"I used a stool like this in my local library when I was a kid, and I wanted one for my new kitchen. I'm rather short and need help reaching the top shelves in the cabinets. We even built a little nook for it in the cabinetry so it's always handy. Love it. Even the construction guys love it and started using it :) Only think we'd make better is it doesn't always roll straight (could use better wheels)."
5,Great stool for a petit wife in a tall kitchen.,"My wife and daughter are height challenged. This stool works great to roll around the kitchen for their use, but is easy for me to kick out of the way. Hated having a plastic four legged stool always in the way and either have it fall over or make a bunch of noise when I slid it out of the way."
4,Interesting Shirt,"I'm sort of ambivalent towards this shirt. It certainly has a nice array of hues and looks good over a pair of khakis. However, the pattern is a bit sketchy and limits the versatility of the shirt. It's a nice bridge between dressy casual and business formal, but not my favorite style choice."
1,California Missions - History and Model Building Ideas for C,The book was poorly written.The model building idea was half-baked. The book is a dissappointment.
3,There are better recordings,"Mahler's symphony nr 5 is famous for its depth, power, but also for its lyrical and romantic intervals. The dynamic contrast is huge and with somany instruments its important to stay in ""focus"".While this is accomplished by good musicians and a terrific conductor, which the Concertgebouworkest and mr. Chailly undoubtedly are, this recording is suffering from somekind of blurriness caused by bad (too far) microphone placement; The acoustics of the Concertgebouw plays a too prominent role in the recording i.e. too much reverberations causing less dynamic contrast. If you like that, well then this is your disk.In my opinion Mahlers 5th sounds best straight forward with no reverb, etc. artifacts for full focus and dynamic!Ive heard many recordings of the fifth, but sofar the 4D recording (closer miking) of the Berliner Philharmoniker with Claudio Abbado is my best."
2,Overrated,"There are some good things about this recording, such as the unique sound of the orchestra and Chailly's fairly direct approach to the piece. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of 'loose' playing in this performance. You would think it was recorded live, considering the number of late entrances and overall lack of togetherness. The trombones drag noticeably at times, particularly in the second movement. To my ear, the recording quality itself is not the best, either -- too bright in the upper registers and muddy in lower frequency response."
2,Not the Best,"I bought both Mahler Symphony 5 by Chailly and Karajan based on the overall positive reviews on Amazon.They were both disappointments.I can't say there is anything particularly wrong with this one except that it is no comparison to Barenboim or Bernstein (1963).The best way to criticize it is to say that it completely bores me. This version does not make the 5th Symphony enjoyable the way Barenboim does.Mahler: Symphony No5Karajan once remarked that when one hears the 5th symphony time stands still. This version is definitely not the one.After having listened to three or four versions, I have to say Barenboim with Chicago Symphony simply is the best out there."
3,Good if you don't use Vista,"This product, unlike other Microsoft products is Not readible by more up-to-date operating systems. As a matter of fact it won't even run/install. Once you dig out your old computer to install your new prgram the product is good, but be warned if you consider yourself a slow learner, this is not the product for you. This is more of a current US use of the language rather than the complete Castillian style that you would learn in High School."
2,BEWARE: FIRST PRINT ERRATA!!!,"The info in the guide is great, it's just that there are innumerable mistakes. This is not just an opinion. Check www.wizards.com for the extensive list of errata. I would recommend that you wait until the second printing before you purchase this item."
2,What about the Fighter??,"I felt this was a great book for the Fist, the Monks. But I was playing a fighter at the time this book came out, and all excited I bought it. I felt that they lacked in giving the fighter a fair shake in information.YOu get some feats, but most of it is focus'ed on Monks. WHy not call it ""Fist and Fist"""
2,Beware! THis is Not 3.5,"This series is from DnD 3.0 and thus lacks the quality and balance we've all come to expect from Wizards 3.5. Yeah, it's that bad."
4,Weird and Wacky Stuff,"Neat book, if you play a fighter or a monk it's really worth your while to pick it up. Martial arts enthusiasts, you will find several prestige classes and a few feats that you like very much. The weapon section is almost worth the entire book in of itself. Add to that the fact that they cram in floorplans for several types of fortresses, rules for charioteering(adaptable for other animal drawn vehicles to be sure)and some really neat feats make it well worth it."
5,european perspective - still carries some weight- but definetely biased,"Do the europeans not strive -in their own way- for the ""genteel""? Of course, but Santayana writes beautifully, critically and with timeless validity."
1,Incomplete Information,"I found this manual to be lacking in key information. Too much of the manual deals with basic information that any shade tree mechanic has mastered. This manual uses three pages to describe how to change the oil and only 1/4 page on how to remove the front locking hubs.One would also expect an automotive repair manual that covers 14 model years to include information on all 14 model years.I would recommend you continue looking for a manual if you need information on the late 60's to early 80's GM trucks.On the plus side, it soaks up oil almost as well as kitty litter."
5,Great watch!,"A good looking, long lasting, tough watch that you will be happy with. I've owned a couple of these and have never been disappointed."
1,10 year old not crazy about book,My 10 year old daughter thought this book was boring. We make her finish a book once she starts it & hated every page to the end.
3,Considerably less extensive that I'd thought it would be...,"For some reason I'd thought there would be more to this book than what I got. I guess the main text is a medium length essay by Lovecraft on the history of the ""weird tale."" Then there's some additional supplementary text and bibliography provided by S.T. Joshi, who's a big name Lovecraft scholar.But, it seems to only touch on some of the highlights of the ""weird tale"" genre, rather than being the wider-ranging history I was hoping for.I'm thinking books likeThe Evolution of the Weird TaleandThe Modern Weird Tale : A Critique of Horror Fictionmight be more of the literature survey I was hoping for. We'll see. Though they're a bit pricey, so I might have to wait a while before picking them up to look over...Maybe I'll see if they're available at the library before shelling out hard earned cash again. Fool me once..."
2,Great Product...If it fit!,"I was so impressed with the feel and quality of this cover...until I slid my 2nd Gen iPod in it. My iPod promptly slid right back out! The opening is at the bottom so if I were to clip this on my belt, my iPod would slip right out and land on the ground. I'm very disappointed because it seems like a great case."
4,great meals and meal planning,This is great cookbook whether or not you are preparing diabetic meals. Everything I have prepared in here is simple to make and very tasty. One of the greatest features of this book is how everything is planned for a week. I love that type of structure. It also has a grocery list in the beginning of the week that covers all of the meals for the week. That makes the shopping trip very simple. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to eat healthier.
5,great cookbook.....even if you're not diabetic!,This cookbook has great recipes! The results are consistent and the directions are easy to follow. I love the weekly grocery list & the diversity of the recipes.
5,Recipes Even Kids Can Make,"I love this book. The recipes are simple yet tasty and, with a little help, even my 8 year old can make most of them. Since my daughter is using insulin to carb ratios, the information on grams of carbohydrate per serving size is extremely useful. I look forward to more books by Ms. Rondinelli."
5,love it,this is a great cookbook. Every recipe I've made has been a success. Recently purchased one for my dad who is diabetic as well and he has had nothing but good things to say about it.
4,Great book,I received the book I purchased in a very timely manner. The quality of the book was everything advertised and I couldn't be more pleased.I would HIGHLY reccomend buying from this merchant!!
2,NOt bad,"Not a bad product, just not as good as I would have expected. The ideas are enough for the week, though, so you can use it as a base and then go on from there."
2,don't think is't healthy,"The book was advertised as a collection of ""healthy recipes"" good for diabetics. It's really a cook book with the shop list, which is convenient - but recipes left me puzzled - what healthy a bout them? almost all has high sodium content, a lot of carbs, breads.... I don't see any difference with any other books, my Mediterranean cookbook looks more healthier and tastier.... Then there is this ""exchange thing"" for almost every meal - with no single word of explanation what it is. Very disappointing - collection of greasy American food."
5,Healthy Calendar Diabetic Cooking,The book I ordered was delivered on time and I am pleased with my purchase.
2,Recipes do not taste good,We tried two recipes from this book and they were both pretty bad. I don't recommend it unless you like bland food.
4,Recipes are great.,"I really liked the idea of a year of recipes, but having tried this out for a week so far, I've found it lacking. Although I loved the idea of a weekly grocery list, this makes skipping recipes impossible, which I have to sometimes because they call for equipment that I don't own (like a BBQ grill) or foods that I can't eat, and the portion sizes vary tremendously. However, all the recipes for the first week I tried were delicious and not too complicated."
3,Not a Complete Menu Cookbook,"I don't have diabetes. I just like menu cookbooks but it's hard to find one that's tasty and healthy. This book gives you a main dish and sometimes a side dish for every day of the year, but I was disappointed. Some of the main dishes are under 200 calories per seving with no side dish recommendations, much less a recipe for one. I even saw a few that were less than 150 calories. Is 150 calories a meal or a snack? I'm sure this is a valuable resource for people with diabetes, however be aware that you will often have to plan your own side dishes. You need to look at the calories per serving. For example, the first ""meal"" in September has 145 calories per serving. There is no side dish. The main dish for the next day has 327 calories per serving. Now this one does have a side dish, bring it up to 401 calories per serving. Go figure."
2,Liked another much better,"I don't know why I was thinking the book would be different. Reading the description, it is exactly what it says. A lot of text, a lot of recipes and shopping lists, but not a lot on how/why the recipes are better for diabetics. I wanted a little more information. I got the Diabetic Bible instead which had exactly what I was looking for: practical information about living/eating with diabetes AND recipes."
3,Hue1,I have to say i was surprised in reading this book. There was lots of information i had not read before. The book is not only for beginners its for everyday lifestyle. My blood sugar was out of control before i began using the advice written in the book. If you have trouble with your eating habits then try this book. It works for me.Hue
3,Is there an erratum for this book?,"This book is nice with its shopping lists and a years worth of planned meals and all. I have gone thru the month of September snd am looing forward to October. All I have tried so far have been good. Some however I will not do again for personal taste reasons. ANd I too make personal notes on each one to tell me later on, what to do or not do.Sometimes the recipies do not tell you what temp to make your oven some won't tell you how long to bake in the oven.There are charts on each page telling you exchanges of starch, meats, vegetalbes....but being new to this diabetic cooking thing, what are exchanges?There are no go by instructions in the front of the book or any information on what constitues a complete meal such as adding a vegetable or a starch....I just never know what I can serve with it."
3,a truly scary score,"I really enjoyed this movie. It is a great mix of horror and sci-fi, and the musical score is a great mix of techno and orchestra. Micheal Kamen is a good composer and Orbital is one of the top performers in the electronica genre. If you enjoyed the movie then you should definitely give the soundtrack a try. It's dark ambiance, complete with strange wispers and soft chantings in the background will definitely put you back in the mindset of the film. The only drawback with it is that it is a little short. It seems that as soon as you really get into it, it's over."
3,Un-nerving stuff,"I saw the film at the cinema and was impressed, and the music really stood out, it worked great for the film, but on it's own it's not quite as hot. It is still very scary, and the drum beats provided by Orbital make it fast paced in parts, but it is a music score, and unfortunately in this case most of the tracks are similar to each other. If you loved the film then get it, but otherwise I'd avoid it."
1,"Goes great with the movie, but alone. . .It sucks!","First of all i'd like to say that this soundtrack is like no other soundtrack you'll ever hear. It actually plays through the whole ""music"" from the movie. If you're watching the movie muted and playing this soundtrack it will fit perfectly! But if you're listening to it alone, you'll see that it isn't music at all. It's simply background noise, for a sci-fi horror film. If you want to just sit down and be freaked-out, then this background noise outta do the trick."
4,A Movie Soundtrack Worth Buying,"I have bought many CDs based from movies, usually only to be disappointed. This one, however, does not. The mix of techno-beats, classical music and chilling chants will certainly give you goosebumps, if not freak you out. However, there is a problem. The CD is made up of four tracks in total, leaving you to fast forward a fair amount if you want to reach a certain part. Other than that, this is pretty solid. Even if you were only slightly interested in the film I would still recommend it."
5,Very Scary.,This was the scariest movie I've ever seen. This is the scariest soundtrack I've ever heard. I like to play QuakeII and III online and this is the PERFECT soundtack for the game.Only problem with the soundtrack: it's too short.
5,Great EASY recipes,I bought this cookbook because I needed some quick and easy meals that are healthy. I was pleasantly surprised how easy the recipes were AND they are very tasty. I would reccommend this cookbook to anyone with a busy schedule.
4,Time,"I was disappointed that the ""15 Minutes"" referred to prep time and not actual cooking time. Sometimes time is a consideration for me."
5,WW Cookbook,"The item as received when it was supposed to be and in the condition that was described. I have no complaints, I would buy from this seller again!"
2,Weight Watcher's Cookbook,"I purchased this book after being able to preview the recipes beforehand so I was excited to have my own copy. I also purchased this item as ""new,"" but it obviously was not. There were several pages that had hand written notes and a couple of pages that were stained. That was certainly a disappointment."
5,My Favorite Cookbook ever!,"This is by far, one of the best cookbooks I own. The recipes are not only fast and easy, but delicious!I was origionally attracted to the book because of the 5 ingredient, 15 minute concept, but in the end, what matters most is whether or not the family would actually like the food. THEY DID!Along with each recipe, are other suggestions to of food to complete the meal. Very helpful for meal planning! I love this cookbook."
5,Great so far!,Reloaded 50 rounds so far and no problems thus far! Another solid product from hornady
4,Great product,Nice looks.But I dont see the a great value in the snap open lids. At times I think it does not seal the contents very tightly. But I am using these containers to store dry food items in the pantry. Works well!
3,Not as great of quality as used to be!,"I have owned these containers for years! Recently bought this set because I wanted more. Lids are not as sturdy and do not seal as well. They also are thinner plastic. I found they are just not made the way they used to be so I am disappointed. I will be keeping these, but don't expect them to last as long! I have a lot of lock & seals and will be purchasing those from now on because they are durable and made well!"
2,Junk,"When I first purchased these I thought they were great. I started finding bugs in my cereal so I put water into the container and set it on it's side. Water came out! I did find that the gasket had a small indentation on it.I put bread crumbs in another, (round) Snapware and put the gasket upside down and it seems to be water proof. It does snap really really hard. To me if something is air tight, then water should not come out. If water can get out.....bugs can crawl in.I used one container with a screw lid that worked. Check your gaskets."
1,Not Air Tight.,I own three of these Snapware canisters. I tested the manufacturer's claim of air tightness by pouring a few inches of water in the containers and turning them upside down. Bubbles rose and water dripped out. Guess what that means! The walls of these containers are quite thin rendering the shape and airtightness of these containers easily compromised even though they use gaskets. I believe that airtightness is important for dry good storage. Balewire glass jars are not airtight by my experience even though they too use gaskets. Click Clack containers pass the test. I would predict that Oxo Pop containers would pass the test based on customer reviews. Glass peanut butter jars with metal lids and the latest Best Food plastic mayonnaise mason jars with white rubber lined lids pass the test. Click Clacks and Oxo Pops are expensive. Peanut butter and plastic mayonnaise jars are free. ;-).
1,Do Not Even Bother! Nothing like advertised!,"I ordered this for my Mom and it is nothing like it's advertised. They claim it's ""shatterproof Flexiglass"" but in reality it's nothing more than cheap plastic no better than you find at the dollar store. The ergonomic handles are just very wide grips (not handles) which defeats the purpose because they're too hard to handle for those with arthritic hands. For a better price I found a great ceramic set with real handles from Target. these people should be fined for false advertising."
2,canister set,"i was excited to get the canister set. put them in the dishwasher and wanted to fill them immediately. took them out of the dishwasher and the tops were distorted. read the directions and it said not to put them in dishwasher. oh well, too late.dissatisfied that you can't wash them in diswasher! everything should be able to put in there ~ who wants to wash dishes/canisters by hand!BEWARE: wash by hand!"
1,No delivery,Ordered product long ago. Item never got shipped. This has been my worst experience with any product.
3,"Good set, but some pieces are too tall","These replaced Tupperware that are not as easy to grasp. While these have hand holds making them easier to grasp, the larger ones are taller than a comparable capacity Tupperware container and thus don't fit in the cabinet where the Tupperware was."
4,Great containers,Great for bulk grocery items. They have an easy to handle design and the sound of the snap makes you sure it is closed.
2,"Well, they do hold things","They do what they're designed for just fine. Got some cereal or a bag of pasta? They'll hold them just fine. They seal fine as long as you keep the rubber in the seal clean. (If you store something like flour or other powdery things the seal won't hold so well if you get the powder in the gasket.)The biggest downside is that these things aren't safe for the bottom shelf of the dishwasher. The smaller canisters will fit fine up top, but the big ones you'll have to hand wash because they'll melt and warp to the point of being completely unusable if you put them on the bottom rack."
1,Go to the dollar store,"I just received this item. So disappointed. I would recommend going to the dollar store and buying a container over these. The product is so cheap, not even close to being worth what they are charging."
5,snapware canisters,"Have had these canisters for 8 years and love them. Just bought them for my sister who just got married. No complaints about them. Work great for sugar, flour, cornmeal, pancake mix, etc."
3,Great storage,"I was able to use these to get the 'snack' cabinet partially organized - I need to order another set. The containers performed as many described. Lids fit a little funny, but are keeping everything as fresh as when I put the item in. My 4-year-old loves the smaller containers - they travel very well! Unfortunately, she leaned on one and cracked part of the lid hinge. It still closes and seems to be making a seal - goldfish crackers are still fresh inside."
5,Great StorageContainers,"I got 2 10pc sets and I love them. Nice and easy to handle, Clear to see through, and easy to clean. Good price too."
5,Great value!,"Got these at a Target store nearby, rather than online. This is a really good value, as the same products (not even including the scoops) would cost over $28 if purchased separately.The large 120 oz holds a 5 lb bag of flour, and I've been looking for a while for a convenient, attractive container for that. I will be stocking up on these to do my whole pantry.The one-handed, one-motion snap lid is a life-saver, especially if you have kids in the house. If it's not quick and simple, it just doesn't get closed up at my house. With these containers, it only takes a quick smack and it's closed up tight. So convenient, even the 15 year old will do it (I can't tell you how many stale ""reclosable bags"" of stuff I've thrown away).For me, these are awesome. I would highly recommend them."
3,This is good for pastas and beans,"I like this set because it seals really well. You can tell by squeezing and snapping the lid closed and then opening it. It makes a ""pop"". The only thing is... it isn't much good for sugar, salt, or powdery things. The lip catches small particles and won't seal well. I would recoment this as far as what is shown in the picture, but not for baking ingredients."
1,Not very durable!,"We are a military family, so we have to relocate every few years, and these cannisters have NOT held up. They have warped just enough so that the lids won't screw on well, they do not close tightly, and we have found little bitty bugs inhabitting our cereal. The screw-tops are a MAJOR disappointment. We are now seeking to replace them with sealable tops, such as the rubbermaid other ones we have, which aren't as attractive but actually manage to hold up."
3,I returned it,"It was not as good as other ones I have used. It did its job, but it was bulky making it difficult for my 4 year old to use it."
5,Couldn't Ask For More,This kickstand does exactly what it says it will do. A bit stiff but nothing a little lubricant can't handle.
3,I still can't use because display a message error,"In the firts lesson when i click the firts option display a error message..I try in 2 diferents pc's 2 diferent's xp (english and spanish version).when the error appears , it is continued listening the sound, sees menu above, but the area where the lesson must visualize appears in blank (white screen).then if i press back button in the menu i saw the previous screen.P.D. sorry for my english, but i really speak spanish and therefore I bought its product.The customer service just say it's the firts time they had this problem.Firts or not i need answers..."
5,ONGUARD PVC boots,The boots work great if you are in need of waterproof protection. I used them to traverse a soaked prairie and my pants were completely dry and mud-free.
3,HEAVY,"They are huge - weigh a ton, get your correct size I got an 11 because hubby is a 10 1/2 and they are HUGE and very tall and hard to walk in. I wouldn't want to have to wear these and I haven't seen him in them yet."
4,very good,"I'm a big fan of teddy geiger. this item gives you music, old demos, remixes and a dvd. You get a lot for your money. I'm glad I got it. The only thing is, I'm not very into techno so those remixes of songs that have a lot of techno in it, kind of bother me (not all of them, some of them have a cool sound to it, but overall im not such a big fan of techno). The DVD was very entertaining as well."
5,Just discovered these (duh),Can't believe I didn't know EB sold individual gauges like this. These are the ones I always break. Now I dont have to buy a whole set when I break just this one.
5,Should be mandatory reading,"This is one of the few books that I consider great. As a practicing CEO I find it refreshing when common sense thinking shows up in the academic world. If you would like to read a well researched book with a very deep insight into the business world (both American, Canadian and European), this is absolutely your pick. Highly recommeded, even if it is a bit wordy from time to time."
2,Mumbo Jumbo,"Not bad but full of academic jargon - nothing to really go on if you want to know ""how"" to manage - Just alot of blah blah blah. Still there's something to learn from academics on business - when you find out please let me know - I'll leave my email address. Thanks"
4,Love Is The Sweetest Thing,"I ordered the CD by Ray Noble titled ""love Is The Sweetest Thing"". I received a CD of the same name by Al Bowlly accompanied by a variety of orchestras. I want the Ray Noble CD.........................Doug King"
5,Important Story to Tell,This book is great because it thoroughly covers a theatre of the Mexican War that has been neglected. There was much combat and heroism in the Baja during the war. Much of the local population looked forward to becoming a part of the U.S. after the war and we let them down and gave Baja back to Mexico in the peace treaty. Perhaps that's why you tend to hear little about these events.
4,Ball comes flat,"Ball is great, just be aware that you have to inflate it upon arrival because it arrives completely flat in the the box. My son loves it though and it looks like it will last for awhile."
3,needs inflating,"Looks like it will be a nice soccer ball, but it didn't come inflated or with a pin to inflate it. So don't wait until the last minute to open the box. You're going to have to run to the store!"
4,It's a ball. It's round (sorta),"Well, it's a ball. It's a soccer ball. It's small. My one dislike was that the panels are not made in such a way to make a nice round, smooth ball. Doubt this really matters though."
1,Not very reliable,"It looked nice when it arrived. Inflated it, took out to play with my 8 years old son. Right after the first play, there already were scratches and warps. I think the leather is way too soft. After a couple of weeks the bladder gave up. And I wouldn't say it was used too often."
3,PVC ball,"I never inflated this because the slip that came with the ball described it as being made of PVC (one of the worst plastics, google it). It also did not smell good. The seller was great about returns; sent a pre-paid FedEx label within a day of me contacting Amazon (hence the 3 stars). I also realize that some people don't care about PVC, but this review is for those of you who do!"
5,A thoughtful story of conflicting changes and motivations,"Magnolia is a novel for young adults about sixteen-year-old Magnolia Holden, who strives to be perfect in everything she does, including earning her private pilot certificate and working as a junior ranger at the state park. But sometimes life itself isn't perfect; one complication after another sets back her plans; perhaps the most thorny problem is that her best friend has fallen for a student pilot who in turn has fallen for Magnolia. Determined to be the first to her pilot certificate, Magnolia loses sight of the reason she wants to fly: to help the environment and the bears she respects so much. A thoughtful story of conflicting changes and motivations, and the difficulties of growing up."
2,Meh.,"First, I just have to say... waaaay too many exclamation marks in this book--at least one (usually more) on nearly every page. For example, from page 40 (hardcover edition): ""Blood! Thick puddles in the grass! But there was no body!"" Exclamation marks do not equal excitement! Or tension! Or drama! Good, tight writing, on the other hand, does. Not that this book was bad, but it did, unfortunately, tend to be a little superficial and ""cutesy"". To put it another way, these characters behave and speak like grown-ups think sixteen year olds behave and speak."
1,Review of 4 books in one,"These are some of the worst written books I have ever read! It amazes me that this woman ever got published. The story lines are stupid, the adjectives are repetitive and ridiculous and the characters are annoying. These books are so bad, it's laughable. If they're so awful, you're probably wondering why I wasted my time reading all four. Well, I was bored, I needed something to read to pass the time while waiting for Breaking Dawn to come out, and I felt like having a good laugh. Oh and someone needs to tell Ms.Schreiber that if she is going to mention horror movies in her books, she needs to get her killers straight. It's amazing that someone didn't tell her that Micheal Meyers of Halloween doesn't wear a hockey mask!"
1,Wow. I can't belive that was a book.,"I bought this for my kindle, it was like $10. I was excited for it, it seemed interesting but as I was reading about this young girl raven who was a bit annoying, it was like the book had just started when it finished. I kept trying to scroll to the next page but that was it. For like $10 u got about 200 pages, if that. I was extemly disapointed not just about that but how nothing really happened in the book, then when this start to happen it just ends. Sorry but I will spend another $10 on an actual book."
2,"Yeah, not for me. Very juvenile.","Vampire Kisses (First 3)- Obviously I didn't get very far in these as I thought they were silly and juvenile. The goth girl thing is too cliche at this point- see the Immortals, Fallen, etc. for more of that and doesn't even fit her personality or her friends."
2,Not worth the time,"My major issue with ""Vampire Kisses"" is the main characters, Raven and Alexander. They both go on about how 'goth' they are and how they're singled out for being 'goth'. They aren't goth in the least, but the author is selling lies about the culture none-the-less. Raven is 'goth' because she wears black and listens to bands like My Chemical Romance. Does anyone else see the issue here? The author did not to her research about the goth culture, and it is very insulting. Her characters are more of whiney little kids who act out to get attention, and they lack depth. Even the characters of ""Twilight"" were put together better than this book.Do not bother with this. It is a waste of money."
1,Annoying writing style,"I picked this book up, hoping it would be something similar to Twilight. I was horribly wrong. This is elementary school level reading, the dialog is incredibly cheesy, and it's made 10 times worse by the fact that the main character speaks entirely in exclamation marks. So, basically it reads like she is always whining vehemently or yelling every sentence she says. By the end of the book I still had no idea who (or what) Alexander is. Sorry to say I don't care to find out."
3,A big juvenile,"In light of similar-genre books such as Holly Black's ""Valiant"" and ""Tithe"", ""Vampire Kisses"" ends up coming across as juvenile. While it's shelved in the ""Young Adult"" area because it does deal with some sexual matters, it's definitely not as in touch with the true voices of young adults. The writing style makes it seem more like an ""Independant Reader"" than anything else, with heavy use of exclaimation points and simplistic descriptions of emotions and sensations. It's an enjoyable read, but it's definitely not for everyone."
5,Great book for any age...,"I'm a parent of a 13 y/o girl. I recently read a different series that was labeled ""young adult"", but was a bit too grown up for my 13 y/o. Thus, I've taken it upon myself to screen the books she reads, to ascertain appropriate content. So, I must say I've read all five books in the series. I enjoyed them, even though I'm 35 y/o. The books are not extremely long, but do not lack content. So far the series has proven safe for any age. I give it a parental thumbs up!"
2,Nothing but Stereotype,"Though it is well written, Vampire Kisses is definitely low on my `Recommended Books' list.The book is full of typical vampire stereotypes, and lacks originality. Ellen, in my opinion, is too good of a writer for these books. The novels are full with the clichés; sleeping in coffins, allergic to garlic, (or however you would phrase the classic vampire phobia) the whole enchilada. Personally, I don't think that's very original. Not only that, but if you open up to any page, you'll see the word ""goth"" about eighty times. That's pretty ridiculousIf you're looking for an ORIGINAL, non stereotypical, well written vampire romance, I suggest Twilight and its sequels, by Stephenie Meyer. Her vampires are nothing like you've ever seen before.(Clickhere)To me, originality is key. Vampire Kisses doesn't even come close for me."
5,Vampire Kisses,This book was amazing even the second time around cuz I read it in my school library but still astounding
5,A girl who can't come in unless you invite her,"This book was amazing! I have just ordered the other two books in thes eries and can't wait to get them! I am a freak and read books a lot and the way they described Alexander, I wanted to be Raven!"
4,Vampire,I like this book because it speak about falling in love with vampires in funny and dreaming way. If you wanna dream... read it!!!
4,wayyyyyyyy better than Buffy,It was really funny(at least to me). I laughed so hard when Raven took Trevor's clothes that the lunch teachers asked if I was choking.
3,This is not all the series,"Vampire Kisses 3: Vampireville is not on the kindle edition. If I'm going to read the entire series, then I need the third one."
5,Becky @ Book Bite Reviews,"I really loved this novel. I thought it had the perfect amount of comedy in it and that the jokes were all in good taste. I really loved Raven's character and even though she was different and goth and spunky, she still had a normal quality to her where all readers could relate to her and want to be her friend even if they aren't goth. I highly recommend this read to ALL."
2,"Easy, slightly entertaining read","This was one of many books recommended to me by a friend for my 11-year-old daughter, Mini-Me (MM). MM has recently become interested in this genre and, since I have not been too interested in it, I asked my friend for her advice. I needed something that was not too adult-themed for MM to read but also entertaining. While MM was finishing up another book she was reading, I picked this one up to read myself.The tone of the book totally threw me for a loop, considering I had just finished theThe Twilight Saga: Slipcasedseries; however, it was kind of amusing. If reviews of the subsequent books in the series did not promise a more interesting plot, I probably would not continue. In and of itself, this book is okay enough for MM and will probably entertain her thoroughly. For myself, though, it was just a little on the ""is this the best you could do?"" side."
3,Silly but sweet enough to sink your teeth into,"I have a weak spot for teen vampire romance. As a bit of an outsider myself and as a quietly Gothic person, I completely *get* teenagers fascination with vampires: it's a chaotic phase of life, and you feel like you're on the outside of things looking in, and vampire stories help kids embrace this. And this book certainly fits that well. Sixteen year old Raven Madison is a wonderfully snarky kindergothen (ie. a teenaged Goth) who isn't afraid to think for herself and stand up to the golden boys and girls who clutter Dullsville High and try to get in her way as she finds out the identity of the mysterious family that's moved into the creaky old mansion in town. The tone and the writing are a bit flippant and a little silly at times, but it's pitch-perfect for this character and her feelings about her world as she manuevers to find her place in it."
5,one of the best books,"personally, i love this book. i can easily side with the main character - raven and understand how she feels. theres a lot of suspense and curiosity which really doesnt let u put down the book. my only warning - if ur some kinda of super-prep, dont read this book"
1,Not Twilight !!!!,This is like my fourth vampire series I'm reading and it just doesn't live up to THE TWILIGHT SERIES ! I'm trying really hard but these vampire romance series just doesn't have any depth to the characters !I'm recommending the Twilight series which is my favorite series/books by far of anything I've read !
1,Shocking,"I read this book about a month ago and I'm still in shock at how terrible it was. I normally don't critique people's writing styles but come on, this was so horribly written that I could barely finish it. I can't believe it was actually published...and even more that some people like it. Also, I think the author is a little out of touch with the younger generation-what kind of high school party plays Celine Dion music? Really. I actually don't ever write reviews on books either but this was so terrible I felt compelled to save someone from wasting their money."
4,Goth Girls and Vampires,"Raven is a 16-year-old goth girl social pariah who becomes obsessed with the weird new family who have just moved into Dullsville - and who are rumored to be vampires. She is especially fascinated by the handsome teenage son Alexander, who she hopes will transform her into a vampire. He, in turn, becomes fascinated by Raven, but is he or isn't he a vampire?I liked this book - and I really liked the character of Raven, even though she had plenty of goth cliches built into her character. I found the book to be well-written with a good deal of humor, and it dealt realistically with the idea of being different and being a high-school misfit."
5,read this book in one night!!!!,"I actually did read this book in one night. I loved it although it should have had a better ending, I realized it was like this b/c it had to have a sequel. Ive always loved vampires and a good love story and these to things together were crucial for me :)"
2,problem with size,I always wear size 10.5 with medium width and never had any discomfort . But this 10.5M is tight for me.
2,Not that impressed with this polish.,I am not that impressed with this polish. I used with the Mothers powerball and without it by hand. The paste seems to work better for some reason. It does remove some oxidation but had to go over it with mothers paste metal polish.
5,Great product,"What can I say? Mothers makes great stuff for auto care and this is one of them. Just make sure you read the instructions and do it right. Also, this is not going to raise any death from its grave, it the wheel is pretty busted it may just not have hope."
1,Save your money!,"""PowerMetal"" is a joke. This stuff is hardly aggressive enough to remove dust from the surface. It won't polish anything."
1,Doesnt have points-Too old,This book came quickly and it was in good condition but it does not have points. It has the original exchanges therefore its not really usable.
4,I think it does work,I tried many products. this works...it doesn't do miracles but it does its job. just don't overdo.
2,Grandfather's Tale: The Tale of a German Sniper,"The author obviously didnt research enough before he wrote this book. There are errors everywhere in respect to technical data eg weapon calibres etc, also the story begins a long time before the Germans realised the value of snipers which was mostly as a reactive measure to the increasing toll on officers and NCOs on the Eastern front. The Russians had in place a very extensive sniper training program in the early 30's. So in day to day life the first german snipers actually used captured scoped Mosin-Nagant rifles to counteract the high casualties caused by the Russian Marksmen. Also the story is not in the least bit realistic in respect to the combat situations, too exagerated and a lack of realsim in the actual abilties of snipers in those days. All in all a frustrating read for those who actually have a knowledge on this subject."
5,Many truths about World War !!,I found the book to be very exciting and also followed the history of World War Two. The thoughts and feelings of the sniper revealed what must be the thoughts of many fighting men being placed in a military operation where they must kill to stay alive. Learned much about the weapons used in WW11. Would recommend the book to anyone interested in that war and the history of that war.
5,An action-filled book about survival and the horror of war,"I have never read a book quite like this one. It takes the reader back in time, to before the world war even began. The main character, Jeorg, takes you along on his journey as he is conscripted into the Wehrmacht. He begins his journey as a simple baker who is a good shot with a rifle. Gradually, and with the need of one who must survive a very deadly ordeal, he acquires skills of all sorts. The Jeorg at the end of the book is quite different from the one in the beginning. Along his six years of fighting he racks up incredible kill counts (which I believe is quite possible, since there were several German snipers killed by the Russians who had hundreds of kills recorded in their personal books), and loses more than a few friends. His story is one of survival, betrayal, and trajedy."
3,Mixed message,"The story does indeed describe what the war looked like to a German soldier, in a number of different theaters, but I fail to see this as a cautionary tale. The subject, the author's grandfather, apparently killed hundreds of Russian, British and American soldiers, usually from a long distance. At war's end he moved to the United States where he enjoyed a prosperous life secured for him by the sacrifices of the men he killed. The author doesn't notice this. He in fact seems quite proud of him.Three stars for vivid description, zero for any sense of reflection."
5,Fast paced action thriller,This is one of the few books that managed to make me unable to stop reading until I was finished. I liked the many combat scenarios and sniper tactics mentioned in the book. It is an excellent way to experience the war from the viewpoint of a German infantryman.
1,grandfathers schnapps bottle is empty,"this book makes you wonder if the review process was ""altered"". rarely will i not finish a book. within 10 or 11 pages i knew this was going to be horrible.so many errors with basic history and a see dick and jane run writing style make this more a childrens book than any military history.this book was so horrible it went in the trash.you would get more entertainment watching 12 dollars burn than from anything in this book.i would venture a guess that all the 5 star reviews were most likely family or retailers stuck with this book....not worth the trees they wasted or the time it took to write this,just a public service not to ruin someone on reading....."
2,Super Sniper - I think not,"The book is very light reading. I am sure it is great for the uneducated student of WW2. No sniper ever amassed the number of kills that this guy did. All head shots at 700-1100 meters with close to 100% hit ratio ??? No way.Look at the authors credentials, a computer game player??Anyway it is overpriced and silly."
1,Garbage - Do not buy unless you like fiction!!!,"Why was this book mixed in with the German memoir books? I wish I had taken the time to read the reviews here before I ordered because I would have discovered this is fiction. What a joke and shame on the author for disgracing the real German soldiers of World War II. Really, stop playing Call of Duty and day dreaming you are a sniper because war is never a game (that was to the author). Anyway, I was misled by Amazon but they are refunding me my money and this trash is going back."
1,Worst Book I have read in 50 years,"READ THE REVIEWS...SAVE YOURSELF SOME MONEY...I am glad the truth is out there concerning this book. It is the only book I have ever returned for a refund in my life. When a book is bad you just stop reading it, and move on with your life. But, when you run into a book like this you have to stop the insanity! It's not just a silly story, but the factual errors, misspellings, poor punctuation, etc, etc., have compelled me to comment again.....as stated by others: one star ratings were removed(this is not right) and replaced with padded 4 and 5 star ratings. This book is unreadable for anyone who has any knowledge or interest in the Second World War."
1,A totally unbelievable poorly written fictional tale.,"First just to clarify this book is 100% fiction, some reviewers seem to think this is a factual account.Way over the top and poorly written. At one point in the novel the author has this guy carrying 4 rifles(Kar98k,BAR,M1,and a Tokarev along with a supressed pistol and a 30 pound bag of ammo.) Johny Rambo meets WWII.Not for me at all."
1,Grandfather's tale: A tale of a German Sniper,"Sorry, but this book was one I could not finish. The main character is some sort of super sniper who never misses and makes head shots into the stars of this enemies hat emblems at absurd distances. He picks up soviet infantry rifles and slaps his rifle scope on them and away he goes. No gunsmithing for our hero. I suspect he used duct tape to attach the scope. I had to put the book down when enemy tanks were being stopped because they drove into a deep German foxhole half filled with water.If you know anything about sniper rifles or have any experience with weapons or the military stay away from this book as it will have you rolling your eyes."
1,"Really, Really bad...","Stay away from this book. Its that bad. This is one book you can judge by the cover, it has modern US soliders, with rucks and the ""Fritz"" helmet. Need I say anything else?"
1,Ficton!!!!,I bought this book purely by mistake. Its so poorly written I nearly threw it out. However I was travelling and forced myself. Its not accurate and as I said poorly written. Can I have my money back? Not to mention the fact that the lead character uses a captured Russian SVT-40 as a weapon. Very poor choice; I know I had one!
3,Grandfather's tale interesting and his mind is still sharp!,"Erenberger has spent some time to help Grandfather with his memeries after all these years. He does tell a good tale that will make you feel you are there as you feel the cold and the ground shake. If you want to take a trip and place yourself in a pair of low boots with hobnails making every effort not to be captured by the Russians when Berlin falls read this book. It is fast paced and a fast read. Put yourself there with a different point of the war. Not all Dutchlanders were fanatical, some just got caught up and did what their country told them to do.It falls shot of Sam Watkins, Co.Aytch, but Sam was there!Still a good read."
4,Good,Good book and easy to read. Only problem is the author always mentions head shot. In real battle this never always happens!
5,A trip through time,Grandfather's Tale takes you back to the Second World War and makes you feel as if you are an active participant. I'm in the process of reading it a second time because it's difficult to catch all of the little details during a single reading.
1,Not a book to read,"Not a book worth spending money on. Poorly researched. Full of factual errors and grizzly details no veteran or (grand)father would never, ever tell a child or family member unless they were combat veterans themselves. I know because I am a veteran and I know many combat veterans. Including sons of Germann WWII veterans. They can hardly get a word out of their fathers."
1,"Amateurish, factual errors, bad fiction...","I expected a non-fiction memoir-type book, instead this fictional crap that plays out like an after-school special in which a former German soldier tells his great-grandson of his WW2 exploits. This set-up probably works well if your target audience is a teenage boy and you think Call Of Duty makes good research."
3,Pretty good,Good book about wwii snipers and their expirence. If you like to read about German snipers this is the book to read!
5,Excellent book. Very entertaining.,"This book will keep you turning pages until the very end. It keeps building the suspense throughout, right up until the very climactic end at the Battle of Berlin, where the main character fights to defend a city besieged by over a million Russian soldiers in a hopeless fight to the end.Some of the reviews on here which are highly criticle of the book are written by people who admit they only read the first chapter or two. These chapters are completely unlike the rest of the book, as they take place in modern times. The later chapters are sort of ""back in time,"" as the main character, Georg, tells his tale of harrowing survival under the harshest conditions. An inspring and insightful work."
5,This book is Sweeeeeeeeeeeeet!,"Every time I start reading a war book, I hope it's like this one. That is, exciting and action packed. The snipers' life is filled with adventure and danger. Two thumbs up."
1,FICTION! FICTION!,"beware that this is a work of fiction. It is not evident in the groupings that Amazon is using w/ many NON-fiction WWII works. It an okay book for a boy/teenager. PG-13 rating for descriptions of war related trauma, etc. but other than that, if you are an adult reader looking for WWII first person non-fiction, there are many other titles to choose from."
2,look at the cover,"look at the cover,appears to be a us soldier carrying a large alice pack, this book reads like its written by a writter who has received 3rd hand information from a uninformed source I would not recomend this book as it is written about as well as this review."
5,The German point of view,This book is an incredible undertaking. It describes pretty much the entire war from the perspective of a German soldier who would much rather go home than continue fighting year after year. Six years of warfare changes him from a simple baker to a tired and ultra-deadly soldier and sniper.
1,"Self-published, self-reviewed junk!!","Put it this way, the ""1980"" publication date given here is as accurate as the rest of this POS!!"
5,Books dont get any better than this one,"While reading ""GT,"" I kept thinking to myself, ""I can't believe how good this book is!"" I couldnt stop reading it. A first for me with any book."
2,"fiction, and not even good fiction","This book can be described thusly:World War II: Rambo BoogalooWhere the hero routinely pops 1 to 2 Km head shots and apparently any scope is mountable to any rifle, whether it is german or russian... and a soldier can carry 3+ weapons including heavy anti tank and machine guns and sufficient ammo to almost single handidly wipe out 30 machine gun nests, snipers and officers in every major engagement of WW2? I think someone has been playing too many video games."
2,Real fiction,"I could only complete about 2/3rds of this book, frankly because this fictional account is quite unrealistic. If you have read first person accounts of sniper stories in any theater of war, you should stay away from this book in my opinion because you will really struggle with this fictionalized account. The method of storytelling (a grandfather's recollections each night to a visiting young grandchild) did not do much for me as well."
5,Entertaining from cover to cover,"Grandfather's Tale is now my favorite book. I have read it once, and have already half way read it once again. The combination of action and real life events simply cannot be beaten by any other book which I can think of."
2,Boring!,"There are a lot of one-star ratings of this book for a reason. It is written in a basic, elementary fashion and fails to generate any kind of excitement - which should be easy to do given the topic.I'm not an educator, but it MAY be a good book for pre/early teenagers, as it is simplistic and written in a such a basic style, it's as if it was written for children.Don't let the title grab you - there are MANY better books of the genre out there!"
2,Deffinitely fiction...,"This book is truly a work of fiction ,something I somehow missed when I bought it. I found it simplistic ,repetetive and as the story progressed through the entire war,more and more unbelievable. I appreciate what the author was trying to do .... but a character that survives all the battles described with the loss of one finger???,like I said,a work of fiction."
3,"Concept interesting, flawed execution","The narrative concept of this novel is very compelling and I admit that it was very exciting when it was recommended to me by Amazon.com. An immigrant to the U.S. relates his experiences as a German sniper during WWII to his grandson as a cautionary tale about the horror of war. However, this book is self-published and has numerous errors. The narrative jumps from first person to second to third person, often within the same sentence. Numerous spelling errors. Some continuity errors are also apparrent. I feel that younger readers, teens, will be able to enjoy this novel as both an adventure and a moral lesson- but only if it is gone over by an editor who has English as a primary language.Kudos to the author, please keep trying.5 stars for concept.0 stars for readability."
2,Bad Recording,"This recording has terribly uneven level of volume. For example, item #10 and #14 in disc one are barely audible if you set your speaker's volume by #9. The result is a very uncomfortable listening experience. Compared with other compilation that I have, this one ranks at the bottom."
4,Great Smell does not last long however,"Very interesting scent. I get complements on it. Does not last long, maybe 4 hours."
2,"good overall, but not worth reading","As my subject states, _The Intuitionist_ by Whitehead is a passable novel.On the surface, the plot deals with the possible sabotage of an elevator seen by the general public as a symbol of Black progression. On a much deeper level, it is an allegory of race relations in the United States.It is, however, quite a long book, much longer than is expected after having read it. Little major happens until the last 50 pages of the novel, creating a long and tedious read. Few scenes are memorable, and the speech is uninteresting. The characters are dull and monotonous.Actually, Whitehead came to teach a lecture at my university, Rochester Institute of Technology, this fall (2002). He is a much more interesting individual than the book seems to imply.All in all, the book is, to sum it up, boring. It lacks substance, suspense, and involvement. Very passable. Very."
3,"""When you get to the bottom, you go back to the top...""","I had a hard time figuring out what I thought of this book. Its hard to get into at first and then proceeds to excellerate and decellerate wildly. Parts of the narrative were interesting-- mostly the section that directly address the issue of race through flashbacks. The main character, Lila Mae Watson is someone you can root for but she gets lost in what disintegrates into a unfulfilling ""whodunit?"" ( Think pulpy fiction.)In general, the book does not flow well. It felt like the author diliberately set out to challenge the reader rather than write a story; and it shows. There are some interesting but unecc. confusing change of narratives. Ultimately, the book is not memorably."
2,needs an editor,"Great ideas for a book, great themes for a book: everday occupation, blue collar workers, life in the big city, government agencies to make (vertical) transportation safer, racism, bias against women. It has a fine, surprises nearing the climax. All good, but the writing wanders painfully between scenes and times and people. Too vague, way to vague, to a pleasurable read"
5,Dazzling,"You ought not to throw the ""genius"" label around too much. I guess. So I'll circle around it, limiting myself to this: This is a work of exquisite originality that dazzles in every way. The language. The conception. The story. Most stunning of all, of course, is the way Whitehead has crafted an ingenious new form for a meditation on the most pressing problem of U.S. society: racism. What a deep contribution this book is. What a shame, though not at all surprising, that it is not being read by the whole country."
3,Enh . . .,"Whitehead shoots for the stars but barely clears the clouds. His prose ranges wildly from the enjoyably seamy to the (unintentionally) absurdly pseudo-poetic and his characterizations remain largely simple-minded and very, very male. This, despite the fact that our heroine is, well, a heroine. The more the book attempts to draw parallels between racial harmony and mechanical (or other) elevation, the less beleivable he becomes. And his depction of the duelling philosophies of Intuition and Empiriciam winds up smacking of the starkest and cheapest (reverse) racism. There is some choice writing here, but increasingly one just wants Whitehead to stop posturing and get on with the story. If he had had something interesting to say about race and an interesting way of putting it, I'm sure I would have felt otherwise."
4,Very good,An alternate universe in which elevator inspectors occupy positions of power and status. Carefully and cleverly imagined. No cardboard characters.
4,great product,"The book arrived in a timely manner and is in excellent shape. Incidentally, it is a wonderful book, an allegory of race in America."
2,No idea - let alone intuition.,"Half way through this book I gave up. I had no idea where this was headed, what it was about (really) or any interest in the main character. Whether a book is meant as a metaphor or a parable, it still has to provide a way to enter it and enjoy it in order to achieve its meaning. This book provided none of that for me. I had no idea what it all meant and no one (i.e. the main character) to help me try to figure it out. The main character eluded me and therefore, basically, I had no one to take the book's ride with. I am not a naive reader nor someone who does not appreciate fine writing, but this book escaped me on all accounts and went unfinished."
3,Very well written but fatally detached,"Every now and then I came across a sentence in 'The Intuitionist' that startled me: present, active, alive. But that kind of presence did not last and soon I lapsed back into 'interested passivity.' It's not that the book is boring, but it is written from such a detached perspective that I found it difficult to care very much about the larger racial themes or the characters. Granted there are some well written and thought provoking sections here but they never add up to much and I finished the book impressed with Whitehead's skill as a writer yet disappointed in his skill as a novelist."
1,"I wanted to like it, but...","I had to read this book for a class, and at first I thought it sounded interesting. How wrong I was. While Whitehead is truly a wonderful writer (not necessarily author, there is a difference), the book simply did not grab me at all. I gave up half-way through, as I simply could not connect to the the characters, nor the world Whitehead created. There was nothing in the text that pulled me in at all."
2,Requires an Interpreter - or at Least a Foreword,"Try as I might, I could not get into this book. It was almost as if Mr. Whitehead chose to write in a language other than English, but failed to inform his buying public of it first. Newsweek raved, reviews at Amazon.com raved, but I personally found this novel far too abstract for pleasure reading. It reads like an unwelcome assignment. Perhaps it is futuristic. Perhaps it is fantasy. Whatever it is, I don't get it. As for humor, I missed the laugh riot entirely. From what I gather, The Intuitionist pits two training camps of elevator inspectors against one another to painful, even murderous, extremes. So what"
4,Fascinating alternate history,"The Intuitionist is a fascinating alternate history that takes place in an unnamed NYC reminiscent of the 40s. Its surface plot about feuding elevator-inspecting modes: empiricist vs intuitionist seduced this reader into actually being interested in elevators--how they work, who invented them, and how they were tested. The author's depiction of racism is riveting. I eagerly await Whitehead's second novel."
3,A Current New World,"A new world within our own where the art and science of ""verticality"" are respected and revered by society, and where their power in society attract organised crime, with an overlay of racism. An interesting construction, although a little artificial."
4,The Material World versus The Spirit,"Allan quatermain is the iconic white hunter. He can and has tracked his way across Africa into lands unknown to most white men.She (also known as ""She Who Must be Obeyed) is the eternal seductress, the half goddess/half woman who cannot die. SHE is the ultimate in the spirit world.Allan, perhaps, can be seen as the ultimate in the world we call reality.She and Allan plays out this conflict between the material and spirit against the backdrop of the adventure of pushing into unknown darkest Africa.Not as well known, or as well done as ""King Solomon's Mines"" or ""She"" -then of course few books are-this is a worthwhile sequel to both."
3,Need to update the listing...,Track list did not match CD. The CD was a single with a few versions of it. Not the 12 tracks listed here.
4,Judge this book by its cover,"Fun, intriguing and yes, a bit bizarre, the book lives up to its name. Cartoonish characters inhabit cartoonish situations, providing much chuckling and some head-scratching. If you've read other Lethem works (The Fortress of Solitude;Motherless Brooklyn), you know that this one treats you to a view of the author honing his skills, his wit and his pen-shaped weapon."
2,Cartoonish,"The first story, Vision, gave me hope that this was going to be superior collection from a quirky writer, thinking another Steven Milhauser. But Alas, after the opening story, about the strange though emotionally bereft party games of the protagonist's flighty neighbors is upstaged by his own, the other stories left me, well, blah. Waiting for something. To write good fantasy, you have to be able to suspend disbelief on the part of the reader. Lethem fails to do that in most of these stories, or otherwise, the characters were simply too uninteresting to care about."
3,Super Reader,"A story collection with not too much of interest, they are all pretty short. A woman that does the Scarlet Witch outfit to get her bloke's crank on, a couple of kids that grow up to be opposing science fiction stylists, as could be seen by their favorite Marvel characters. Those being Doctor Doom for the Dystopianist, and Black Bolt for the Utopianists.Then there is Super-Goat Man, the superhero who lost his comic etc. because of lameness and outspoken political viewpoints, and ended up faculty at a small college after being a hippy."
2,There is no answer key...,"This book has the vocab needed for the first volume. It has exercises for the lessons.But, there is no answer key, so you have no idea if you are answering correctly. If you are trying to self-study, that lack of answers will make studying and learning that much more difficult.It was too expensive to be this useless to me."
5,book review of Dragon Venom,"This is a great conclusion to the Obsidian Chronicles! Loved the first book, second book was great, but the third one is adventurous like the first book and wonderful if you like daring superheros, dangerous situations and magical creatures. It is like a vacation from reality."
5,Excellent.,"The final installment of the Obsidian chronicles does a great job of tying up the storylines from the previous two books. The character development of the main protaginist comes full circle, and the reader is left feeling satisfied with the end result.One of personal favourite points about this book is the simmering resentment between Arlian and his best friend and steward, Black. Instead of just glossing over the Black character, Watt-Evans gives him real motivations and desires, ofentimes which don't co-incide with those of Arlian. It is a real treat to read the interactions between these two men."
1,George on Drugs,"George is clearly stoned! Too bad we don't have the concert from Japan around 1992, with Eric Clapton. The 1992 show would be great on DVD. Here, George is playing too well and even Clapton on My Guitar Gently Weeps is not in form.Plus, there are all too few Harrison songs. Something and Here Comes the Sun are there, but once again the performances are lackluster! All in all, a great disappointment! BUYER BEWARE!!"
4,Classic Soundtrack But I Was Hoping For Better Sound Quality,"My vinyl copy for the Concert for Bangladesh is still in excellent condition and for the era, most of it sounds very good. I made a cassette tape of my favorite tunes when I first bought it, then a CD copy a while back after buying a CD recorder. I expected this remastering to be an improvement over the CD copy I made of my vinyl and it really isn't. Mind you, I'm not saying that the CD sounds bad, but the vinyl was very clean on the songs by Dylan, Clapton, Harrison and Russell and they sound a little muddier on CD.The sitar music never appealed to me much back in the day, but I've now listened to it more because of buying the CD and my appreciation has grown. But still, the folk and rock sections are the part that stand out to me. Listening to these discs really bring back the memories of that special time. Ravi and George did a wonderful thing in organizing this concert. It's great that it's available again."
4,A trip down memory lane,"I was fortunate to attend the evening performance of the amazing Concert for Bangladesh in 1971. I went mainly to hear Dylan, who was ethereal, but the entire concert was fabulous. It was mindblowing to see and hear all those great musicians together on one stage. After not listening to the ablum for years, I was reminded by Beware of Darkness on the recent Concert for George, of the powerful version done by George and Leon Russell. That song alone is worth the price of the CD, but there other great ones: Wah Wah (Leon Russell's piano and Billy Preston's organ!!) as well as While My Guitar Gently Weeps,Leon Russell's Jumping' Jack Flash/Youngblood, and Dylan's performance of Just Like a Woman."
4,Consciousness rules,"Not that they necessarily did it first or best, but in 1971 George Harrison and friends raised concsciousness of and money for the cause of hunger. THE CONCERT FOR BANGLA DASH documents the rockin' good time they had doing so. How was it decided that Billy Preston and Leon Russell would perform solo songs but Badfinger (at the height of their career in '71) and superstar Eric Clapton would not?"
4,I was there,"I was lucky enough to be at the Concert for Bangladesh--the evening show--and this recording truly captures the event, flaws and all. What it really captures most though, is the excitement and the joy that was felt both by the performers and the audience. Half the Beatles, DYLAN, Clapton, and the rest, all on the same stage at the same time. Sure, some of the music is rough around the edges, but that's what makes a live performance special. For anyone who wants to understand what music and concerts were like before all the corporate sponsorships, sellouts, and prefabrications. And some truly amazing stuff from Bob Dylan, at the peak of his form, even though he had not played live for years. Essential addition to any collection. Sure, some of it may be dated, but that only means it is well-aged."
5,Muy Muy Classico,Big time charity concerts don't get much better than this. THE classic super-concert with THE super rockers and George Harrison's best days.
4,"Touching, honest and heart opening","Interesting documentary about Chastity Bono's sex change to become ChazBono. It deals well with the complexities of life for both thetransgendered, and for the children of very famous people.Quite touching and informative, it makes the still uneasy and confusing(for many) subject of sex re-assignment far more human, andunderstandable on both a technical (how does it work?) and - moreimportant - emotional level.It also doesn't shy away from the hard parts (e.g. the difficultpersonality changes brought on in Chaz by his intense hormone therapy).Chaz is allowed to look self-centered, and even like a jerk at times,without it impeding on our sympathy or identification. He's just aperson, like all of us, which is the whole point.While the film-making itself can be uneven, this is the kind of filmthat helps people open their hearts and minds to those who seem'different'. And that is always a worthwhile thing."
3,"Not exactly a Kittyhawk Mk IV, but it still has a place on my shelf","I don't know where they had been hiding this Corgi. Box was not in the best of shape, but there was nothing wrong with the Kittyhawk. This diecast does not have landing gear, so you have to put it up on the stand. Not the most accurate, since Corgi used their P-40E molds for a P-40N (yes, there are differences between the models)Not the most accurate Kittyhawk, but it is a nice addition to my collection"
3,"Unfortunately, this came broken","I superglued it and the birds play with it, but the packaging could have been a little more carefully thought out."
3,Great Concepts: Bad DVD,"I like these miracle balls. They seem to help my low back. But, I don't know if they would help other parts of my body because the DVD that came with the balls only explain the one series of low back exercises. I can't even find a book by Petrone (let alone a complete DVD) that explains all the positions possible with the balls. I actually thought my DVD was damaged because it ended so abruptly and didn't get to a couple of things I thought she was going to explain. I kept going back to the menu and trying again. This was a good idea executed poorly. I guess I will keep searching for more information on how to use my new miracle balls."
3,Not what I wanted,Either I didn't read the description right or there are several different versions. What I wanted were all the exercises to follow on a DVD so I didn't have to use the book while I was trying to position the balls. This is just a basic introduction to her method with a few basic positions.
5,Back Repair for everyone,I had severe back pain for years and this is a great fix for everyday back pain.
3,Borders on Misrepresentation,"The balls work great, but the DVD only barely shows you how to begin with using them - for your pelvis/back only. There is no instruction for neck, shoulders, lower back. There is too much emphasis on breathing and a ""body dialogue"" which is a bit hokey, but would be palatable if there had been complete instructions on using the balls. It is a cheap trick to only give ""introductory"" instruction - you have to buy other CDs to get full instruction. This leaves one with a bad taste in the mouth, and a feeling of being taken.All of that said, I do like the balls themselves, so it wasn't a complete disappointment. Too bad they took the low road. I hate feeling like I was snookered."
5,Worthwile shorts!!,"This tape has some of the best and funniest shorts made by the Three Stooges. There are three good ones here, ""A Missed Fortune"" ""Corny Casanovas"", and "" He Cooked His Goose."" All are very entertaining and will make you laugh hard. This tape is espacially good for Shemp fans, as he is in all three. This is a very worthwhile tape, coming in at a pricey $11.99."
5,The best,This is one of the best cps I have purchased. The 60ies songs have been given a different interpretation by artists in the late 90ies and they are terrific. I do a lot of driving in the outback of Australia & I put this cd in the player and just SING along. Just brilliant. Do yourselves a favour and buy this as your money will not be wasted.
3,OK -- Shoulda Been More,"Sometimes the whole is less than the sum of its parts. Look at the artists, look at the songs, and you'd expect a whole lot more. I, at least, expected a celebration of the 60's singer-songwriters with a new generation insight. Instead, what you get here is pretty much pale note-for-note copies of the originals. And where that is not the case, the take is wrong --Jules Shear sounds like he can't wait to get through Darling Be Home Soon and John Gorka sounds like he's never going to get through Thirsty Boots. Highlights come early -- Jonatha Brooke and Bleeker Street, the inimitable Chrissie Hynde and Morning Glory, and Iris Dement and Loudon Wainwright with Pack Up Your Sorrows. Listening to this CD here on vacation at the beach, I now understand why it remained on the shelf without a hearing since about six or seven years ago. It's basically a well-intentioned snoozer."
5,I enjoy this CD more every time I listen to it,"It's hard to recapture a place, a feeling, and we all know how strongly Bleecker Street shaped the face of folk and folks all around the world. This collection appeared both as a 4-disk vinyl set and the more common 2-disk CD version. I wish I had the vinyl, but I'll muddle through somehow.I loved the original music, but this tribute is a wonderful fitting effort. It's hard to come by, so if you see a copy grab it up quick.My favorites:My Back Pages -- Marshall CrenshawThe Last Thing on my Mind -- Cry Cry Cry (definitely a group to listen to)Since you Asked -- Beth Nielson ChapmanNo Regrets -- Curtis StigersRebecca Kyle, August 2008"
2,Terrible production,Peter Gallway's production blunders are the main reason this release fails to capture the directness and simplicity of the early singer songwriter movement in NYC although performers bare some of the blame. The normally reliable Patti Larkin sounds bored not world weary on 'Everbody's Talking'. Lucy Kaplanski has kept Dar Williams from going over the top in the past but here she just joins in on bland harmony that spoils the heart of Paxton's song. The best ones are simply O.K. such as My Back Pages and stick to the original. Some like 'Come Together' get absolutely swallowed in the production. This disk is a good reminder of what is lost when high tech producers bring a sappy romantic approach and simply loose the songs. A very poor release that says more about the vapid state of singer songwriter today than anything about its beginnings in Greenwich Village. Truly poor.
5,Play this for your kids,"Most tribute albums leave a lot to be desired, not true here. These are all wonderful songs covered by artists who treat them with the respect, dignity, and creativity they deserve. All are great but I'd like to make special mention of ""The Loves Still Growing"" by Buzzy Linhart. This was an overlooked gem when Buzzy did it and when Carly Simon covered it, lets make sure it doesnt get overlooked now. A special treat is I noticed that Buzzy's getting his publishing again (he was robbed of this by some kind old record executives), thanks to the good work of his son Xeno. This cd will bring back great old memories for us and create great new ones for our children."
3,Pretty good..some questionable choices,Lets not forget that this era of music was the best songwriter period we have seen in the folk/rock genre.Its pretty well represented here with some nice versions of the tunes...Everybodys Talking is a bit more up tempo than fred neil and interesting.I have never really warmed up to Darlin be home soon...its just not that good a song and its real hard to sing it convincingly...the version here is pretty lame.My Back Pages is great although if you didnt know who it was it sure sounds like the Byrds.There really shouldnt be any obscure tunes on this cd cuz there was so much to choose from but Since You Asked is pretty out there in the wings.My favorite...the tim buckley tune.
1,What a disappointment!,"I thought I was going to get a great CD worth of prople takingchances and performing interesting cover tunes. Only Marshall Crenshaw stands out with a great version of ""My Back Pages"". Jonatha Brooke and Ron Sexsmith are really overrated, though I know some people love her. Jules Shear is a great songwriter with a very limiited voice. The Loudon Wainwright duet with Iris is OK; Chrissie Hynde's choice of ""Morning Glory"" is plain awful. Patty Larkin is OK, Suzanne vega is almost totally invisible, and John Grorka, the Roches, Paul Brady are wasted on really bad songs in the first place. This thing will be all over your used CD stores; buy it there..."
4,Faithful but refreshing rendering of some genuine classics,"I've never been especially fond of tribute albums, which always seem to be either ill-conceived, misguided, or both. Happy to say, ""Bleecker Street"" is neither. The selection of songs is in itself a history in microcosm of sixties folk-rock, and the matching of artist to title is almost always on target. Of particular interest are Jonatha Brooke's wistful version of the title tune, John Cale's channelling of Cohen's ""So Long Marianne"" (with Suzanne Vega the perfect choice for harmony vocal on the chorus), and Ron Sexsmith's plaintive ""Reason to Believe"". It's also nice to see long-forgotten chestnuts like ""Thirsty Boots"" and ""I Ain't Marchin' Anymore"" covered. Well crafted and produced, this CD (along with ""Return of the Greivous Angel"", the Emmylou Harris-helmed tribute to Gram Parsons) has restored my belief that tributes can actually function well (and artistically) as albums."
1,Great soundtrack - lousy sound quality,"This Hallmark version is not only in monophonic sound, but taken from LP and sounds terrible. The music itself is great and needs a true release from the master tapes by the copyright holders."
3,"Good, but not the best","I was a little disappointed with this volume. Good, but not the best. Having said that, I still plan to purchase all of the volumes of MST3K."
3,Played to death on Sci-Fi,"(Revising prior comments); Yes, all of these episodes are fun but, like the selections from Vol. 4, these episodes were played over and over on the Sci-Fi channel, to the point where I simply got tired of watching them again. A decent enough set if you're unfamiliar with these selections, but as a long time fan I was hoping for something more exquisite. I don't really care about extras; I'd just like to see more of the earlier titles. It's hard to pick just a few, but for example, imagine a boxed set of MONSTER A GO GO, TIME OF THE APES, MIGHTY JACK and DADDY-O...!"
3,Joel was better,"I'm a big fan of MST3K but I gotta say we need some Joel Hodgson-hosted episodes mixed into the next box set. And some more documentary material wouldn't hurt, either. How about the BBI produced TV bumpers for the episodes? Thats an easy one, how come we don't get those?Anyway, you can't miss with MST3K. Even Mike can get a decent episode together."
1,They slipped this one in!,"This is not classic MST3K.While MST3K has gone through many changes and reconfigurations throughout the years, the loss of the core writing and performing staff has finally doomed the show. Without TVs Frank (Frank Conniff), Dr. Clayton Forrester (Trace Beaulieu), and of course, Joel, the Sci-fi Channel episodes just don't cut it.Mike Nelson and Kevin Murphy are terrific, but are not enough to justify the expense of this volume. The charm of the classic episodes just didn't make the transition. For those of you who, like me, have never experience a single comedic moment from Mary Jo Pehl, you should pass on this collection.Just be warned, if you buy this one, make sure you know what you're getting. This as post-classic MST3K. And sadly, Rhino has made no attempt to distinguish this collection from the others. They tucked it quietly between two classic collections. Shame on you, Rhino!"
4,A good representation of MST3K,"This volume has some solid works on it, and overall is a worthy edition to the MST3K collection. Each of the four movies featured have their strong and weak points, and everybody will have their favorites, but this is how I ultimately rated each one in terms of performances by the stars of the show:Boggy Creek II: 8/10Merlin: 7/10Time Chasers: 8/10The Touch of Satan: 9/10Each episode made me laugh out loud, which says a lot in itself since few shows do. Pick this up if you're looking for a new type of comedy or are a fan of MST3K."
5,MST3K Still Rocks!!!,"If you've sat and laughed your way through MST3K on Sci-Fi Channel, then you need this collection! Boggy Creek II is almost worth the price itself! This is quite possibly the ""best"" horrible movie that they ever poke fun at. Very few people in this movie have ever been in front of a camera before. When you tell your kids, ""Yes, we really did dress that way in the 70s!"" they won't believe you!! Merlin and Satan are just plain strange. Time Chasers is ultra low budget 70s fare."
4,"Half good, half bad","Two of the movies on Volume 5 make the set worth the purchase, the other two I probably won't watch again. Boggy Creek II and Time Chasers were non-stop laughs, and probably both will end up being in my top 15 MST 3k when I've watched them all. Merlins Shop and The Touch of Satan just weren't that good. A few moments of laughs here and there but really neither movie is worth to sit through again, because if there isn't enough funny spots from the guys the movies can't carry it."
5,All very funny episodes,"All of these are good choices from the SCIFI years, but the absolute best of all of these is with out a doubt, Boggy Creek II. I never get tired of watching that one and often times show it to friends. Even people from Arkansas laugh at it.What gets me the most about this film is that the director, who also wrote and stars in it along with half his family, really truly believes he is cool, but comes off as such an ass.It's also funny that the state of Arkansas helped fund this film, because it makes never ever want to visit there."
5,Nobility and Love,"Steve Ilg is as noble as they come and his work is a work of love. I have read many other books in the fitness category and none compare to the path of Wholistic Fitness. And it is so much more than just fitness. If you want a program that teaches you about yourself and expands your perceived boundaries about what is possible as a human being, TBT is the place to be. If you want to reach all the podiums of life, look no further.Namaste, WT"
3,good for general info.,There is good gereral information in this book but it is not an all comprehensive electrical guide or even a full explanation of the electrical code. Not good for pros.
4,Good starter for wiring,"Compact and simple, but also complete, this is a great guide. It doesn't have tons of pretty illustrations, or any full-color photos, but it has useful, descriptive diagrams, it's concise, and its thoroughness is very pleasing. Highly recommended."
4,Simplified is simple,"This is a great reference for the beginner who is undertaking a ""simple"" project. The book is kind of like ""Cliffsnotes"" for the NEC, and would be very handy for the beginner who does not know that much about electrical installations. It provides easily understood diagrams and descriptions for your everyday home projects, with references to the applicable NEC codes should the user decide to investigate a particular application in more detail. The more advanced users may want a reference with more detail, but this version is great for its intended audience (beginners)."
1,Wiring Simplified,"I was very disappointed with this book. I thought it was too simplified and did not contain information found in much older versions of Richter's book. For someone needing to know how to connect a light switch it would be all right, but for anything much more complicated than that it was not good."
1,Poorly written and not worth the money,Here is good evidence why Indiana is not a mecca of fine wines. Mr. Vine needs to take a few classes at U.C. Davis or read any of Amerine's books. The faults are too many but he did do a good job by inserting Government Regs and a lot of tables that would be hard for him to screw-up.
3,"Kind of silly, but entertaining","If not for Peter Lorre, this movie might be too silly to sit through. But Lorre turns in a grand performance, along with G. Carroll Nash as the detective.If you can not laugh when 'THE HAND' starts crawling around, then you are indeed a serious horror movie fan!Recommended for Lorre's performance."
1,Good Book - but Extremely Pedantic,"Great book on the history of inverse probability if you are pretty good in French and Latin - otherwise you miss almost all of la Grange, Laplace, Poisson, Condorcet, etc. as the extensive quotes are from the original texts. I realize we are all supposed to know 18th century French but it's just that American thing getting in the way. I wonder if the author knew enough Russian to look at Kolmogorov?"
1,this video is a one star cause that's it goal !,hey to all you tough guys check out this video and see where your toughness takes you.end of comment.
4,Wish the splines were tougher,"I bought two of these to replace a missing crank on my '91 Miata. The plastic splines on the first crank shredded, though I may have accidentally crossed the splines while fitting it, and I probably should have spent more time greasing the window tracks thoroughly. Oh well; the crank is cheap enough that another didn't set me back much, and a more careful eye when fitting the second one got it to set properly. No trouble with it so far and it looks just like the factory crank. I do wish the plastic inside the splines was a bit tougher, but hopefully this advice helps someone else from chewing up their crank!"
1,"This ""pamphlet"" is the worst book I ever bought.","I bought this book because of the catchy title. The book is 120 pages long with very trivial tax tips. On top of that, almost haft of the book is blank space. I bought this book with certificate. Now, I got stuck with ""smart"" book. Oh well, smart for the author, stupeeed of me."
3,It's not a new recording,"I believe this is another copy of songs Lou did in his pre-Foreigner days. I don't believe this is a new recording. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent recording, but it's by no means new."
4,Lou Gramm's Done It Again,"It's been awhile since we've seen anything new, but the wait was worth it. Once again he has shown us another side to his voice and depth as a vocalist.I did not find it a disappointment.Since I look forward to each release like a child at christmas,it was worth opening this package."
1,shoddy and not trustworthy,"A few well-informed Beatles fans say this book reprints other people's research, fails to correct mistitled tracks, and makes up a few song titles.That last one may seem a rather damning accusation, but Belmo has prankish tendencies, and credible people say the author had no sources for the following titles, and probably made them up from whole cloth: ""Maisy Jones"", ""Baby Jane"", ""Portrait Of My Love"", ""Girl With The Red Umbrella"", ""Three Ships In The Harbor"". EMI confirms these titles do not exist.If you need a bootleg shopping list, there are quite a few online -- search on the term ""Beatleg"". If you need reliable information about the Beatles unreleased tracks, Mark Lewisohn's ""Beatles: The Recording Sessions"" is considered authoritative at least for the studio work, and is available used."
2,A must have ... 5 years ago!,"At a time where so much good and up-to-date information is available on the net on the Beatles' bootleg recordings, this book is really a waste of money.It probably was a must have in 1997, but it would require a serious update in order to compete with several websites dedicated to the Beatles bootlegs."
2,quality control an issue,I ordered a deluxe Quidditch robe elsewhere and was convinced I had been sent the economy version.It was made of thin cheap looking fake 'crushed velvet' polyester.I had a heated discussion with a sales assistant who assured me it was the deluxe version despite the fact it looked nothing like the photograph on the packet which looked like a heavy fleece fabric.It carried a Rubie's Costumes label.I returned it and shopped elsewhere hoping for better.This one is slightly better but still looks cheap and is made of thin velvet polyester.This too carries a Rubie's label and is supposed to be deluxe.Have all the felt ones been sold and poorer quality robes been substituted ? It is also rather short and has a badly printed smudged 7 on the back too.I dearly want a felt one for my daughter for Halloween.Any suggestions anyone ?
3,It is regular (OK) quality made costume,"I bought this item because my kid wants Harry Potter costume, and I see the good review of it. However, I was a bit disappoint when I see the item.It just a very normal (OK) made costume. I don't know how you compare to other costume. To me, it is not the high quality. It just acceptable. The one of the node ring is already fall off. The rope is not the same as the picture. It is pretty short and look like shoelace. I think this costume can only last couple wears.I give it 3 stars only because my kid likes it, and like to wear it."
2,Served its purpose,"I bought this for my son to wear to a child's wizard party. The cape arrived & unfortunately I immediately noticed that the number 7 printed on the rear of the cape (Harry Potters quidish number) was peeling off which I rectified with superglue. After my son wore the cape, for the parties 2hr duration, I then washed it by hand. Once dried I noticed the cape has become unstiched in several places which is rather disappointing. The cape will no doubt still be used, however I would have preferred the quality last longer than one wear."
1,Poor quality,"After only wearing this robe for a week the crest and letters are peeling off. He has probably worn it for an hour each day. We are now ordering a Gryffendor patch to sow onto the robe. I saw on some previous reviews that they had letters that were sown on, but our robe has letters that are glued on."
4,Breif Review of Web Standards Solutions,"I picked up ""Web Standards Solutions"" and Dan Cederholm's other book ""Bulletproof Web Design"" as a package from Amazon. While I prefer the latter because of it's smooth read and less academic feel, ""Web Standards Solutions"" provides a nice foundation for getting a handle of CSS essentials and limited markup. I only found it lacking in the area of advanced CSS layout, which can be a tad frustrating if you're looking to this book to answer all of CSS mysteries. Even those who are experienced with CSS may find some new insight in the area of limited markup, which is key in developing sites that are optimized for search engines and markup that is truly independent of it's layout. In short, it's a quick read and well worth the cost at any skill level."
5,Excellent cookbook for tableless CSS-driven web design,"This is a cookbook (it's not a reference book), and it'll show you day-to-day tricks to create professional web sites separating structure and information from presentation using XHTML & CSS.What I liked too is that markups should be as much descriptive as possible (using tables only for tabular data, using h1 tags, em instead of i, strong instead of b, lists for lists of items, whatever it is, even for navigation menus that are just a list of links. This is very clever.Dan will prove you that tableless layout is the best and that it's possible to create state-of the art web sites with CSS.Download the CSS handbook in PDF from the W3C web site and buy this book. You're done.Errata: there's only one error that I noticed: p.104 under ""Dotted borders"", 1st snippet, it's written ""text-decoration: green;"", but it should read ""text-decoration: none;"", but from the context, it's obvious for the reader ;)"
3,Great introduction,"I whish I'd read this one sooner. This book is a great introduction to the fabulous world of web standards. This is not, however the right book if you are already an experienced coder of standardized (X)HTML. Unlike books such as CSS Mastery (Budd, Moll, Collison), this book contains little of the ""oh, right - I had completely forgot about that"" tips, that experienced users could use.If you have done little web standards (X)HTML and would like a good place to start, this is absolutely a book I would reccomend. If you know your web standards, and like them too, I would reccomend looking elsewhere."
5,useful and practical book for newly converted CSS believers,"very useful and practical book on CSS-based layouts. it compares alternative ways to 'markup' (write your html) and to 'style' (write your css). what i love about it is that it presents the pros and cons of each real-world methods, then you'll be able to figure out which is best for your specific purposes. and makes you smarter for next time.most methods presented are the right way to do it, while few are hacks, but it'll tell which is which. an easy read, the kind you can jump from one chapter to another. infact so easy i finished half the book before i got it to the cashier (oops, sorry i didn't order online).who is this book for? probably not ideal if you're not yet a believer of web standards. not for experts, as they may have read the same material when it was discusses in the author's site simplebits.com. but most suitable for those who just converted to CSS tableless design and curious to know exactly how others are doing it."
5,Really a 5th grade level math book,"You should know that saxon math 6/5 is really a 5th grade textbook. My children's private school in Lake Tahoe uses Saxon math. Everyone does math at the same time, and the children are allowed to enter whichever level they test into. Most of my daughter's 4th grade class is using this book. My son in 2nd grade is using the 4th grade text (saxon 5/4). It is a very logical progression of concepts with much review built in. That is why children are often able to skip a whole grade level. For K, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade levels, there is a program, but the children work on worksheets and not from textbooks.Overall, a great program, but if your child is even slightly above average in math, consider going up one level."
1,by the christmas fire.,"not at all what I was expecting. Definetly not christmas stories. I read just the first small part, closed it and left."
3,This book should be renamed the bible of B.S.,"I gave this book a rating of six for the comedy factor only. Though the book is entertaing it gives the general dog public a very negative view of almost all the breeds disscused.I wish that someone that doesn't have little man's complex would write a book on these breeds. The book is a well of misinformation and inaccuracies. Though I still find it extremly humorous to read and should be in your dog book library on that alone. If you want to read an informational, realisic, and sensible book on the APBT and similar breeds, read Colby's book on the American Pit Bull Terrier or Jessups Working Pit Bull."
1,Reivew from a reader,"I definately would not recommend this book to anyone, ESPECIALLY the novice to any of the breeds contained in the book. It contains LOADS of FALSE information. I gave it 1 star because it did have -some- truthful information."
1,GARBAGE,"This is one of the worst pieces of GARBAGE I have ever seen! I cannot believe it ever got published or that reputable book stores actually carry it! People - it glorifies dogfighting which is a FELONY!!!!!!! A direct quote from this piece of trash - ""The American Pit Bull is indisputably the most effective fighting dog developed by man. ...I mean that contests between Pit Bulls and other breeds have been staged with the results consistently supporting the contention that a Pit Bull will defeat any other animal that has ever been called a dog and then some."" GARBAGE! GARBAGE! GARBAGE! Do not buy this thing - instead demand that it be pulled from the shelves."
4,the world of fighting dogs,"A great book for anyone wishing to know more obout bulldog breeds, it also expells some of the myths surrounding fighting dog breeds. this book does not promote the fighting of dogs, but does explain the history of the barbarrick so called sport."
4,HISTORY,why are so many people bent on trying to erase history. this book and other like it are like history documents around the turn of the century. selling these books doesn't mean people are going to fight dogs anymore or any less. ALL THESE ANIMAL ACTIVIST ARE BORDERLINE IGNORANT !! wow
3,I'm just guessing. I'm hoping it's better than that.,I really don't know. I have not heard them myself. They were gifts and I have not heard from the recipients.
1,I find this book uttlerly disturbing,this book was a very disturbong experience and I would not recommend it to anybody
5,"Now We're Cooking With Gas, Grease and Girlfriends!!!!!","The wheels of Season 3 are moving at a fast and steady pace. We are getting into the ""meat"" of the characters without delay. Joan and her ""issues"". Toni and her ""mannerism"". Maya and her ""divorce"" and Lynn and her ""behavior"". You gotta love this girls. They are truly a mess. And, it's a trip worth taking and staying awhile."
4,Very good Bootleg,"I had no idea when ordering, but it's a bootleg copy. You'd never know. The only way you can tell is by the artwork on the case and DVD itself. It plays like its straight from the studio."
5,CAN'T GET ENUFF....LOL,"ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS WHEN IS SEASON 4,5,6,7 ARE COMING OUT??? I WATCH MY DVD'S EVERY WEEKEND(I HAVE MY OWN GIRLFRIENDS MARATHON) AND I STILL LAUGH"
5,A warning,"'Havana Red' is NOT ""The first of the Havana quartet featuring Inspector Mario Conde... "", nor is it ""... a fantastic first tale."" A fantastic tale, no problem, but not the first. It is the first one translated into English, but it's actually the third volume of the quartet (Spanish title 'Mascaras'), and the forthcoming 'Havana Black' ('Paisaje de otoño') was the final volume, not the second. It's a pity the English translations aren't being published in the original order, as the reader is going to miss out on some of the pleasure of following developments in Mario Conde's personal and professional lives - especially those involving Tamara - in their correct sequence.The original publication dates are: Pasado perfecto, 1991; Vientos de cuaresma, 1994; Mascaras, 1997; Paisaje de otoño, 1998.By the way, I haven't actually read this translation, but I've read all four volumes of the 'Havana quartet' in Spanish, and I'd give each of them five stars."
3,That's How It Is,On the 243 pages of the book he uses the big F word 75 times - not a shock but surprising. Best of all his Catholicism shines thru as a part of his every fiber. Worth the read.
1,This phone and T-mobile,I haven't been happy. This phone is horrible. They replaced part of it and it still doesn't work right. I tried customer service over and over. The only way to get help is to refuse to pay bill until they respond to the problem. Not happy all the way around.
2,Below Average phone (Basic Need Only),"I really missed my samsung camera phone, this phone just lack everything compare to my old phone except better in battery life and little bit less bulkie. I brought this phone Last July... that's about 1 year ago and this phone still survive? wow. I was bit suprise i dunno why make this phone stand? if u don't use speaker is really hard to heard phone call. Exterior Screen is too old school basic like a pager. Interior screen solution is low and music tone is crap. Point is only get this phone if u just want very basic phone and i do really mean it. Look whise is not a attractive either."
3,"Fine, except...","Much has been said about this phone's reception ability. However, no one has spoken to its biggest problem -- that is, its 1.8 MB of memory. This phone can only hold about 30 text messages. So if you anticipate wanting to keep texts for the future, this is not the phone for you. You'll end up deleting texts that you'd prefer to keep."
5,Simple and Very good.,This is exactly the phone I was looking for:1. Got an excellent Speaker2. And No Camera (Who needs a camera on a cellphone anyway?)Very satisfied with this simple and compact phone.
2,NEEDS HELP,THIS IS ONLY THE 2ND CELL PHONE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. IT IS SMALL AND EASY TO HANDLE.HOWEVER I FIND THAT THE INSTRUCTION MANUEL IS VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND.I HAVE THE VOLUME TURN UP AS HIGH AS IT WILL GO AND IT IS STILL DIFFICULT TO HEAR THE PERSON CALLING ME.THANK YOURAY
2,Mediocre,The plasma screen cracked within one month of purchase. The phone never fell nor did I treat it roughly. It just cracked in my pocket.I also found myself a bit frustrated with the extremly small buttons.
2,Basic phone with poor reception,"A nice looking phone for a cheapie, fairly easy to use (with some odd quirks, I'm used to Nokias and Samsungs), with basic features that are enough for those who mostly want to make phone calls. The organizer works well and it's nice to be able to send text messages to multiple numbers, but the phone does have the annoying Motorola trait of only having one number per name entry.However, the v188 failed at even being a basic phone for me, as reception was notably worse than my Samsung X105 (which I've just gone back to after a few months of using the v188), and it got especially horrible when friends who also had T-Mobile picked up Motorola V330s.The printed manual was also poor, seeming like the writers just made sure they wrote about all the features as opposed to explaining them in-depth."
2,This is the worst phone I've ever had,"This is my first Moto phone, and I'm not happy with it at all. Before this phone I had a samsung. When it was time to get a new phone I went for the v188 because it's small and inexpensive. I was very happy with the phone at first...easy to use (you can probably get away with not having to look at the manual), and the sound quality was pretty good. After only six months of having the phone, I'm having problems like dropped calls, call failure, and lots of static.Needless to say, I can't wait to to get my new samsung that will be arriving in a couple of days!!!!!!!"
2,Works great for about 5 months,"I picked up a Motorola V188 because I wanted a simple, small, inexpensive cell phone w/ no special featuers, and this phone fit the bill. I had to go back to the T-Mobile store within a couple of months because all my friends complained that they could barely hear me. The store gave me a new one for free, and this one worked great... for about five months. Now, whenever I have to use it, the call always has a lot of static. I need to tap it a couple of times to get rid of the noise. This time I'll pay to not get stuck with this phone again. I've had Motorola phones before and they've worked great so I may end up with another Motorola, but definitely not the V188."
3,"good display, and ummmm yea........","bought it from a t-mobile store, new when i renewed my contract, i loved the display, crisp graphics, but thats about it that's good on this phone. i'm comming from a nokia 3595.the moto's reception is bad. it breaks up and it cut a conversation. 3 days after i bought it, less than 50 mins used. oing back asap. back to nokia :), too bad thier display sux"
1,worst of the avilable phones...,The first V188 that I got came with a defective speakerophone. I returned it and the second one that i got was has some software issue and the phone scree becomes black and shuts off every time I open the phone to make a phone call.. The battery also drains really fast. Basically it is a simple phone to make and receive calls but the phone is too flaky and no less than a toy phone.
2,Returned,"I returned it.Experienced high pitched noise at all times......faint but there.Speakerphone volume is so low as to making it usless in all but silent environments.Ringer volume is also underpowered.Battery life is ok......not great, ok.Menu layout was confusing."
3,Just renewed my lease and got it from T-Mobile,"I was happy with my previous phone V300. This one gives lot of dropped calls, lot of static when travelling in car... Recommend buying some other phone."
1,Simply does not work,"I do not know how they can screw up something as simple as this phone, but it ismply does not work. The problems which I experienced with it are:1. turns off by itself2. freezes up3. does not turn onOtherwise the design and the simple features provided are great, but it simply does not work. So do not but this thing unless you have the free time to ship it back and get something that actually works."
4,Chillingly Beautiful,"Not since Diva have I enjoyed such a penetrating soundtrack. Its melancholy hooked me from the beginning of the film. If you enjoyed the soundtrack from Diva or Joe Jackson's sountdtrack from Mike's Murder, you'll enjoy this."
4,Great costume!,I only gave it a 4 because the wig is hard to keep in decent condition. My 9 year old daughter loved it!
2,Pretty much a total wash,"If you're seriously considering buying a Skrewdriver album, don't get this one, especially if you don't like racism. It's not ""controversial,"" it's just dumb. Skrewdriver is a decent band, however: I highly recommend their Boots and Braces EP. Much better songs and free of White Power idiocy."
1,ian stuart rest in piss,"skrewdriver is extremely overrated. they were a gimmick. one of their earlier albums has a quote on the back that says ""we don't need your fascist bulls**t"" but somehow became the most notorious racist band. their music is not that great and their lyrics are ridiculous. buy some good oi, like the angelic upstarts or the oppressed, do not support this album in any shape or form."
2,Defective clip- waste of money,"I brought this holster because of the styling and price, but be aware that the clip is glued on instead of stiched or pinned to the holster, so it will loosen within a month or more of use. Mines is falling apart in less than a month of use. Its money wasted, look for a better product elsewhere."
2,Pouch is not leather,"Wrong advertising....the pouch is not leather but then at this price what do you expect. The belt clip is already torn off (within a week)!If you want a case that will last for a while, go for the genuine palm case. Much better built.The charger seems to be fine though."
2,Unsatisfied,The product was fine however onla last on monthe. I was expecting better quality and durability. I didn't happen.
1,Not so much about creativity,"I bought this book to be inspirited by the creative people. By their lives, by the way they think ....I have not found enough inspiration in this book and read only half."
1,Humbug,"The title of this book should be ""The Case For Racial Quotas in College Admission"". As the director of admission at Cal Berkely, Laird destroyed the lives of many black, Hispanic and Indian students. He admitted them to Cal even though he knew that they would never graduate unless, of course, there was a quota system for graduation.Severl years ago, PBS produced a program on the S.A.T. It showed that Laird's office admitted a black applicant who had never received a combined verbal and math score of more than 800, and rejcted a white applicant who's combined score was more than 1,350.Of course, this black had no chance of passing his freshman year at Cal unless there was a quota system for promotion. Laird's data are not credible and his inferences are not logical. The inarticulate major premises of Laird's argument is that blacks, Hispanics and Indians are intellectually inferior to whites and Asians. If you accept his premise, you will enjoy his book."
5,Bringing Capablanca's chess back to life.....,"Capablanca plays enchanting chess. He plays chess like no other else, making the strongest players of his time look like beginners. The simplicity and the economy with how he wins is brought to life by such a good author in Fred Reinfeld."
5,GOOD,"Very nice book on Capablanca . Fred's reviews are quite enjoyable . Play through Capablanca's games and increase your chess level and way of thinking about chess . For the price , this book is a bargain . Buy this book please !"
2,not really worth getting,"not bad, but not as entertaining as sondheim: a casebook. some of the analyses were quite obtuse (e.g. the lacanian analysis of sweeney todd and the argument that passion is about sondheim's relationship with his mother). i thought one of the more interesting essays was the first one about passion, but there weren't many others that were particularly relevant or insightful."
1,Questioning if this product is Polycarbonate or ordinary plastic,"The appearance of the product is inferior - looking like a Dollar Store type purchase. It is stamped USA on the bottom. The cup was manufactured in two pieces and the seam is very visible and is raised from the outside surface so it can be felt. The inside of the cup has the smooth seam.I do not know how it will wash as yet since I am using it in a very large bag of dog food for a measure. The cup is 8 ounces but there is no room at all at the top. I have used it to measure liquids, but I can imagine it dripping and spilling since there is not a bit of extra height to the measuring cup. It is advertised to be a DRY measure however. Since when would one remember this fact??The raised measuring marks are painted red and look like they would not hold up to dishwashing, but that I do not know yet.The cup looks and feels cheap. It looks like if it were to drop, it would shatter."
1,PINK FLOYD LIVE IN VENICE - 0,"BEWARE, THIS SET IS A BOOTLEG SET"" IT IS ONLY TO COME WITH A DVD NOT 2 CD'S AS LISTED DO NOT THINK SET IS TO BE LISTED ON AMAZON.I GIVE IT A -1"
3,VHS to DVD,"it looks like sombody recorded from VHS to DVD, YES that's the video quality you're gonna have in this productand the quality on the audio CDs it's Ok"
1,DVD bad Soundquality,"The Soundquality of the DVD is terrible. It's inadvisable. The CD's are ok. Eveline, Switzerland"
1,Disappointing on all levels.,"The only thing worse than the disjointed camera work is the lighting. The reviews that call it ""subdued"" are being kind. Seeing dark images of the band members from a distance doesn't make any sense when the intent to show the surrounding scenery is lost in shadows. Audio is tolerable at best. And if you can somehow ignore that, there's the fact that David Gilmore, in his quest to replace Roger Waters as the frontman, has given up much of his guitaring to a backup guitarist. David should have stuck to guitar and gotten a front with a voice and personality."
1,Hate it.,"Bad video bad sound, its like someone in the audience bootleged it.Worsted dvd ever put out.Pink Floyd would have never put this out."
4,"VERY GOOD,DVD SOUND CAN BE IMPROVED","VERY GOOD SOUND ON BOTH CDS ,THE DVD SOUND COULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED A LITTLE BETTER,BUT THEN THAT'S WHY THERE ARE GRAPHIC EQUALISERS TO DRAW THE BEST SOUND OUT. THE 1 STAR REVEIWER WHO SAID THIS DOES NOT COME WITH 2 CDS ,MUST HAVE PURCHASED A DIFFERENT SET AND SHOILD BE DISCOUNTED. IT IS WELL WORTH OWNING AND AGAIN IF YOU ADJUST YOUR EQUALISER FOR THE DVD, SOUNDS FINE!"
5,Ann-Margret Does It Again !,"The Cowboy And The Lady is a fun CD Ann-Margret did with Lee Hazelwood.I particularly like this as it includes her rare single You Turned My Head Around.You Can't Imagine is another nice solo by Ann-Margret.With Lee my favorite duets are Am I That Easy To Forget,Only Mama That'll Walk The Line,Hangin' On,[Later covered by Cliff Richard]and Sweet Thing,which is a punched up hilarious song reminiscent of the duets that Loretta Lynn and Conway Twitty made so popular.A nice CD to have if you are an Ann-Margret fan !"
2,Editorial Review is SO incorrect,"It amazes me that the Editorial Review of this album lists Ann-Margret as also being the star of the movie ""SPEEDWAY"" which starred Elvis Presley and Lee's BEST singing partner ever...NANCY SINATRA. Not to critize the abilities of Ann-Margret, but you would think they would know the difference. GEE!!!!!"
5,It's Organic!,I bought this product because it's so hard to find organic items where I live. It was mild-warm in my opinion. Just as hot as I care to go for an every day hot sauce. I wish I could subscribe to this for auto delivery.
5,Why this works,"There are two paths to enlightenment in classical chinese culture... martial arts, where the body movements cause transformational changes in the brain, and the path of the scholar, where calligraphic practice with the Confucian classics, when done correctly, causes the energy to flow out of the brush onto the paper. This also causes transformational changes in the brain. I could be a bit more esoteric, but the bottom line is, this is the first transformational methodology for western culture, similar to chinese principals, I've seen. I recommend doing this and it really will change your life."
3,Well Kinda ........,"I like the off-set for getting into tight areas that this base was designed for. BUT due to poor QC I had to cut away on the plastic part that surrounds the collet lock just to get the latch to close. Come on Bosch, bad enough the base plate on my Colt was broken on arrival (replaced with a phone call.Thanks guys). But this was ridiculous. I should NEVER EVER have to repair/modify a brand new tool just to use it."
2,Not usable upon arrival,"This item arrived with an incorrect component part and was not usable. I contacted Bosch (800 #) and they said ""this happens"". They agreed to ship me a correct part and a week later it arrived.Not what I expect from Amazon or Bosch."
4,Nesting Buckets ~ Great for a 14 month old,"We bought this product for my 14 month old daughter for Christmas. Some of her favorite toys in recent months were her small stacking cups. These buckets are similar, yet stack so much highter (taller than her!) Each cup has a nice rim that helps the cups fit together. It's been improving her eye-hand coordination. I've noticed an improvement in her skills in the two weeks we've owned them. The sorting shapes are also great. She enjoys putting them in the bucket. I love that it is so portable and self stores all the little pieces. It's a great toy to take to Grandma's house. My only complaint is the handle is already loose on the one side and regularly comes unattached."
4,awesome,"My daughter got this when she turned one and didn't touch it. But now, at 16 months, it's like a brand new toy. She puts things in the cups and rattles them around, knocks the towers down when I stack the cups, and she puts the cups inside each other, and takes them out of each other too. She really enjoys this, and the toy is incredibly versatile. I highly recommend this toy."
4,Great Toy,"This is a great toy. We use it at the beach and it is self contained, sturdy and durable. My 9 month old loves it."
5,All around awesome,"We received this as a gift for our son. If you're only going to get one shape sorter or stacker, this should be it. I love that it's compact and everything is contained in the bucket. I love that it's sturdy and durable. I love that you can stack, nest, shape sort, and just use it as a bucket. It's fantastic. It also has counting and colors on everything so you can do that with your kids, too. Great for ages one and up."
4,My Son Loves it!,"My son was 14 months when I brought this home and he loved it then as much as he does now at 16 months. Helps with balance, hand/eye coordination, learning colors and just passing the time having fun. He plays with them for a good 15 - 20 minutes. Loves to squal with delight knocking down what I've just built up for him!"
3,Eight instead of ten :(,I purchased this product expecting to receive a set of ten nesting cups. I am very disappointed with this product. I do not feel they advertised their change in product specifications. They should have clearly indicated how they changed this product. I would like my money back as I feel I was deceived.
5,The toy they never outgrow,"We bought these for my son when he was an infant. Fifteen years later, they are the only ""baby"" toy that we still have and, believe it or not, use. There are countless ways to play with this toy--stacking, numbers, colors, shapes, sizes--when your child is very young. As they get older, they make great bath toys, sand toys, bug specimen cups, etc., etc. We love them so much we give a set with every baby present."
3,The tower falls over too easily,"When a child stacks those buckets and touches the tower even lightly, everything tumbles over - they don't stack or stick together well enough in my view."
3,Ok Toy a bit overrated,I liked it but my toddler not so much. She plays with it for like 2 minutes and that's it. Maybe she is too old for it (18 months)? I bought it because of all the great reviews but unfortunately this didn't grab my toddler's attention.
5,Great bath toys,"I bought these for my 14mo old girls and they love them. The shape sorter and bucket are the first toy they go for and can spend an entire bath playing with it. They are learning to pour water from one cup to the other and have a great time.Some of the cups have drainage holes and so do the shape blocks.The toys are made well with hard sturdy plastic. These things are going to last a long time.The blocks are hollow but a good hard plastic. They are a good size. Fits their whole hand.The shaper sorter bucket top snaps on so the girls can't open it themselves. Sometimes I just leave it off the bucket and they play with the blocks and just the top.The bucket handle is a 'break away' ....almost too easy....so no strangulation concern there.Overall, I really like these toys and so do my girls. I would definitely recommend to a friend or buy as a gift."
4,nest & stack buckets,"bought for our youngest g daughter to help with fine motor skills, she has already lost the smaller pieces, but that isn't uncommon.... great price for product"
5,Toddler's Favorite!,"My son loves to shape sort, but that's not what makes this his favorite. He loves to stack all the buckets on top of each other, make a tower, and then knock it down, plow it down with his mega bloks wagon, run through it, or drive into it with his tricycle. Hours of fun with just a simple little toy!"
4,fun and durable but description needs to be updated,fun and durable but description needs to be updated it says 10 stackable buckets however there are only 8 I'm keeping it since my baby has so much fun with them
2,Actual Product Is Not As Described Here,"Actual product is only 8 buckets inside of the shape sorter bucket, instead of the 10, plus holder described in product description. Numbers are 1-8, not 1-10. It only stacks to 2 feet, not 3 feet as stated.The box had the right information, but this page does not. I can only assume the company cut back to save money. I would rather teach my toddlers to count to 10, not stop at 8.Also, on the box it says great bath toy and great for sprinkle activities. Then it says, ""Do not immerse in water.""My 17 month old twins (who have no trouble taking the tops off their sippy cups) needed help getting the top of the shape sorter.Also, the biggest bucket is no bigger than my hand. I thought it would at least be the size of a regular sand pail.There are many other stacking products that you can immerse in water, that you actually get 10 of, and that are cheaper than this one. I plan to return this and notify Amazon of the incorrect description."
3,Only 8 buckets and 2 feet tall,"I purchased this toy as a gift for my nephew. We have these buckets for our kids and it's been played with for 4 years and counting! Ours is like the description says, 10 buckets with numbers 1 to 10 and stacks 3 feet tall. The handle eventually got loose, but that's just wear and tear.But what I received this time is not what the item description says. The box's description is 8 buckets with numbers 1 to 8 and only stacks up to 2 feet tall. I know my nephew and his parents won't know the difference, but I want to get what I paid for.So just be aware that you are NOT getting 10 buckets."
5,"Must have! If you love live music, you will love this!","I knew the name of this band from their hit, ""Meet Virginia"", but was not a die hard F-A-N. THEN, I found this CD. This LIVE CD really puts into perspective how badly songs are ruined when they edit them for radio. I don't mean edit as in bleep out words, I mean edit as in loose the unique and amazing sound that the artists have.After listening to this CD a million times and instantly falling in LOVE! My husband and I saw them in concert. They are amazing. The lead singer has a charisma and stage presence that is so rare and so mesmerizing. This is a must have for any music lover.I am now a F-A-N!"
3,No thousand words here - just pictures.,"This budget priced book contains many lovely and enlightening examples of Hopper's drawings including some studies for some of his well known paintings. This slim volume contains no text at all, not even an introduction, with the single exception of a short blurb on the back cover. The quality of the paper reflects the price of the book but Hopper fans may still find this a valuable addition to their art library."
1,Disgrace,"Dover and the Whitney Museum should be ashamed of this book. Printed on the cheapest paper without any consideration for the image quality of the Hopper drawings, the book falls flat as an inspiration for students and is a disappointment to those of us who admire and appreciate the quality and spontaneity of his line. Gone are the vivid contrast and sharpness of line. A waste of money!"
2,Damaged,"Decent book, but this slender paperback arrived with several large creases through the middle as though someone had punched it, which makes it difficult to page through."
3,"works well, a little wobbly though","I used 2 of these to mount 2 dell vostro mini towers under a desk. They hold them up just fine but need regular tightening. They were easy to mount, but Im a little weary of those wood screws holding the computers up long term.Pros:-easy to install-light weight-holds a mini tower just fineCons:-wobbly when bumped (inherent to the design)-suspect mounting hardware-straps need tightening regularly"
4,Why Didn't I Get This Sooner?,"Keeps the floor clear, and clean, under the desk. It also keeps the CPU from sucking in dust from the floor and promotes air flow around the unit keeping it cooler. We all know that heat is the killer of electronics. Great cost effective solution, easy to install and once in place, you don't have to adjust it all. Quality construction of frosted metal suspension bars that attach under desk, and straps that are easily adjustable. I highly recommend it."
5,All you need.,"Worked perfectly. To mount it under an IKEA table top composed of structural cardboard (not wood), I first glued and screwed (laminated) a half-inch thick plywood plate to the table underside."
1,COMPLETELY AWFUL,I have read hundreds of romance novels - the Scottish genre being one of my favorites - do not waste your money on this one. There is no story. The characters' feelings are unbelievable. I could not even finish it.
1,Is this Elaine Coffman????,"I'm a fan of Elaine Coffman's books. I loved the MacKinnon series. I was pretty disappointed when I started reading this book, I couldn't believe Elaine Coffman had written this. I didn't even finish the book, after reading to a hundred pages I was so bored I couldn't find the energy to continue reading. I found that the characters had no depth at all. Enough said I think. If you want good Elaine Coffman go for the MacKinnon series."
5,In My Top Five Out of Thousands!,"I couldn't believe the reviewer who wrote that this book was awful. It's one of the best I've read and I read three to four books a week. The love story is beautiful, it's steamy and memorable with wonderful characters and settings so incredibly described that I will never forget them. This book will stay in my heart. Ignore the bad reviews. I guarantee you'll love it."
1,Did not enjoy this one!,"First let me say I did finish the book, thinking it would get better. It didn't. The problem I have with the book is that I did not like the lead male character one bit! I thought at first Sophie would be with his charming, funny brother. Now THAT would have been a good book! Instead, she gets her brother, sigh... What would she see in him? He is arrogant, rude, totally lust crazed and we get to hear many of his male chauvenist ""You'll do what I say no matter what"" comments. It disgusted me that even when he was the cruelest to her and she was so hurt, it still didn't stop him from going in and having sex with her. There was no love here, only lust, arrogance and pride. Therefore, while at first I thought of the female lead as a strong independent woman, towards the end of the book I now considered weak. This was my first book by this author so I don't think I'll be reading any more of hers."
1,"Interesting, but shouldnt be taken seriously","This guy, with a very special sense of humor, tries to mix all the natrual and social and medical sciences, philosophies, religions, totems, sorceries, moral things, occult stuffs - all those things that you know only a bit but not all - into a single entity called the ""wheel"" .While in the same time, he claims to be the hyper-machanic - the only one that will get the ""wheel"" running smoothly.... emmm .... very imaginative."
2,rip off shipping charges,the shipper ripped us off w/shipping charges ...$17.00 to ship i6oz....not happy at all
4,Interesting Accounts of Alien Abductions,I found this to be an interesting review of several Alien Abduction cases which are investigated through the use of Regressive Hypnosis.
5,I LOVE THIS GRILLER,"i saw this Casa Moda Smokeless Tabletop Grill with Ceramic Tray at linden 'n things and was gonna purchase it at $29.99 and thank goodness we didn't ... We brought this Casa Moda Smokeless Tabletop Grill with Ceramic Tray at a GREAT bargain price at amazon ... we use it all the time, i make Korea BBQ sliced meat, shrimp, vegi, etc. etc. with it and it is GREAT !!! we enjoy it alot and can grill the meat and cook it as we eat ... it works great on sliced meat such as beef, pork, chicken ... cooking the meat is pretty quick as long as you DON'T put thick slices on the grill ... for those of you who like Korea BBQ, like us, this is a great addition to your tabletop applicances ..."
3,Beauty and the Beef,"Only beautiful Dorothy Dandridge and handsome Lex Barker in his flapping micro-mini skirt make this film worth watching. Sparks fly in their brief scenes alone but Hollywood was too racist in the 50's to let nature take its course, so Plain Jane gets the beef."
3,Encyclopedic review of every Ryder cup match,"Mr.Jarman has undertaken a tremendous task of recounting as accurately as possible every Ryder cup match ever officially played. This is no small feat which he accomplishes with surgical precision. This text is for the hardcore fan of golf and golf history, it certainly does not read as a novel, but is more akin to an encyclopedia. I believe that the Silverman review has lifted literally the most ""exciting"" passage in the book to share with potential readers, the book is not riveting in this sense. I recommend this book to persons with a strong interest in golf history/Ryder cup history, with the caveat that it presents facts and very little lore. If you are searching for a book that is difficult to put down,that paints the scene for you and makes you feel that you are literally in the crowd-this is not it, stick with Mr. Feinstein's two previous works, Good Walk Spoiled and The Majors."
1,Somewhat disappointing,I was really looking forward to this book. I am a great fan of golf. My father was a professional player and I follow the Ryder religiously. I found this book dry and the author obsequious in an irritating way having met him at a golf tournament. I guess my expectation was set too high. I definitely would not recommend this book.
1,recording balanced by engineers who were drunk,"This appears to be yet another bootleg...the source being a purloined tape from NBC radio who broadcast portions of the 1972 Newport in NY Festival. The liner notes admit balancing problems. What you need to know in advance of your purchase is, there are many sections of the cd where, for instance, you hear the saxophone section and the bass...nothing else! Weird. Jerry McKenzie cymbals sound like constant ""sssssssssss"" all through the cd. Shirley Luster, aka June Christy, reunited for several songs. Miss Christy, ahem, could not have been in worst form. Summing up, almost unlistenable! Wish someone would have written this review before me. I coulda bought something else. Terry Armstrong, longtime Kenton Phnatic."
5,Adoraciones,"Al Leer este maravilloso libro me sorprendió y me sigue sorprendiendo que fuera este Maestro cuya disciplina es rígida y que encarna el orden y le gusta que las cosas se hagan de inmediato, Quien fuera el autor de todas las Adoraciones, Reconocimientos y Alabanzas a Dios, a los Seres de Luz, y manifestaciones Divinas bajo el nombre de Thomas Printz. En verdad se siente el gran Amor de este Maestro y Su reverencia por la Vida. Dios te bendice Maestro el Morya, recibe nuestra gratitud y amor."
4,What a Christian marriage ought to be,"Dennis and Barbara Rainey are the parents of six children, and have a very high-profile ministry named Family Life. Having been married for many years and having faced a lot of stress in their lives, they are well-qualified to write on this subject. They discuss some of the kinds of pressure which undermines marriages and then they list six ""Courageous Choices"" which they have made which they feel has pressure-proofed their marriage. This little book contains Bible-based directives which can make a real difference. It includes a ""Pressure Test"" which is a good indication of where a marriage stands on the pressure scale and what can be done to help any problems a couple might be having. This is recommended reading for married couples."
5,Just what you need,Snip 'N Twist is exactly what you want for all your twist-tie needs. You snip off the length you require. Your tie is never too short or too long. The plastic coating does not peel away leaving you with bare wire. The package allows for easy dispense of the tie and stores the tie remaining on the roll neat.
5,Excellent general resource,"Sucheng Chan offers a statistic-rich, informative history of Asian-Americans, from their first immigration to current issues of As-Ams as ""model minorities"". I definitely prefer Chan's style to Takaki's quote-heavy, anecdotal approach; she is both thorough and concise."
4,difficult experiences for over a century,"Not a casual read. Chan describes well over a hundred years of Asians emigrating to and growing up in the United States. Many of the pages describe years of backbreaking toil, especially in the California goldfields, and in the building of the transcontinental railroads. Exacerbated by periodic bouts of discrimination by the European settlers and immigrants.In a relatively short book, the account cannot be comprehensive. Complexity is added, due to the different nationalities of Asians that came over. Chinese. Japanese. Filipinos. Koreans. There never was one unitary Asian bloc in the US. Thus descriptions of various benevolent social and cultural organisations that arose are often split by ethnicity or nationality.The text also shows that the civil rights movement of the 1950-1970s, while primarily for Negroes, also benefited Asians. Something not necessarily widely known or appreciated today."
4,Really good books for 1 to 2 year olds,"These Max books, by Rosemary Wells, make terrific gifts. The board books have about 8-10 pages. The story is told with words and pictures. Max, and his sister Ruby (who is the caretaker) are quite adorable themselves. They have fun even while doing chores - taking baths, going to sleep. These books are easy enough that kids feel they are ""reading"" them quickly. They can also identify with the activities in the books.In this one, Max takes a bath, with grape juice and sherbet joining him as ""boats."" Eventually a second bath is required, and finally, it's Ruby who needs a bath!For a kid named Max, a few of these are a terrific gift (after all, he'll get a ton of Sendaks)."
3,Not Bad,"Not a bad Shampoo, can't really tell the difference in my hair to be honest. My hair is growing really thin up there so I needed to try something different. I probably won't buy this again...but hey, it may work for you."
4,Nice volume,"I haven't been using it that long yet, so far about 1 month, but I like works well for Volume."
1,Very Dissapointed,"Product was recommended to help thicken thin, limp hair....just because Rogaine makes it, it should be great, right?....not only did it not thicken my hair, it, actually, made it oily, and even more limp....try something else!"
3,Shampoo misses the mark,I like the shampoo for cleaning my hair. It did nothing to make my hair fuller or have more volume
4,"FYI: Does NOT contain active ingredient Rogaine, but worth a try","It does say on the bottle that it does NOT contain Rogaine. That said, I'm kinda neutral on this product. My hair does seem a little thicker (but it's actually curling as it gets longer), and for this price of $6.49 it's worth a try for people who want to try and thicken their hair."
3,Okay but not great.,"It does volumize that hair as claimed, but it also leaves my hair somewhat dry and fly-away. However, I do live in a very dry climate, so it might work better in a more humid place. Still, it's not as good as Finesse volumizing shampoo, which is the best I've found so far."
2,didn't work for me,"I bought this shampoo as a companion to the conditioner version of it. Neither the conditioner nor the shampoo did anything to my hair. I was hoping that my hair would stop falling, but it feels like it became worse. I wish I could really find a shampoo with good price that would stop my hair from falling. I don't recommend this product."
3,It Isn't Really Volumizing,I was disappointed that this shampoo did not give much volume.I have used some volumizing shampoo that does give your volumebut this was not one of them.
4,Really???,I can't believe amazon is asking for a review on this.I honestly don't know if it works but me dermatologist told me to use it.Since I am under 40 and don't want to lose my hair I will continue to use.
2,"Eh, i wont be buying it again..","I wont be buying this again...Doesnt thicken my hair...Who knows if its working? I dont know? I take it with Rogaine. i took Propecia for years but its like $90/month and the recent dealbreaker was that they found Propecia can cause permanent sexual problems, so I stopped and started Rogaine and this instead. I dont really notice anything from this product? If anything you need to start using head and shoulders because Rogaine dries your scalp out so much.."
4,ordering more,I'd been trying to find something that worked on my fine hair but less expensive than what I'd been paying. Very happy with Progaine as far as volume and manageability.
2,Not for me,"Does not have the effect that it claims to have, period. Did not notice thicker hair after use for 2 weeks."
3,OK but not that impressive,"I have tried it for about a month and haven't experience any magic difference. It does what shampoo normally does, but regarding ""volumizing"" function, disappointing, it seems not work on my hair. Maybe I should continue to use it and then see what will happen."
5,Great for fine hair!,"I love this stuff! My hair is a little thin on top of my scalp, and when I use it, somehow the thinness goes away! on days that I have to use other shampoos, the thinness is instantly back. Great buy, great price, buy it!"
4,Hard to find,I like this product but it has become unavailable in this aeea or at least where I purchased it in the past. I find it handy that it can be purchased through the Amaon site
2,Not for me.,I had high hopes for this shampoo but it only made my hair fall out more. I noticed the same thing with Aussie shampoo then I went to Finesse and had no problems. If you notice the more expensive shampoos causing problems for you then this product is in the same category.
1,Save your money,"These are some of the worst pictures and example of the species and subspecies I've ever seen. The information given on each is sparce and very general. So unless you are looking for fuel for your fireplace, don't bother."
3,Not worth the money,"Not a bad toy... if it cost $15. But for $30-$35? Robbery! Amazon doesn't list the dimensions, but it's relatively small. The plastic looks cheap, even though there aren't many tiny parts that appear at risk to break off. Finally, the wheels don't spin very well, which I know would frustrate my 2 year old son on Christmas morning. I would welcome any suggestions for a better toy cement truck."
2,Hard to Remove,I've tried plenty of spray waxes...this was the hardest to remove of the bunch. There are definitely better products out there!
2,crappy delivery,i complain that the bottle was deliver cracked nothing was done it not a great product it dosn't work that great
4,I like it,"It's Simple To use and the voice is clear as a bell. It lets you know if you're turning left or right ahead of time so you're prepared and when you get to the exact spot for the turn it beeps. And... If it's so hard to remember what direction was told to you a minute ago, there's a directional arrow at the bottom left which points in the turn of your direction. If you miss your turn the system reconfigures to where you are and will direct you from there. Again, I like it."
1,Poor Product,"I had high hopes when I bought this GPS system.When the Cobra arrived, I eagerly opened it and read the manual. The manual takes about three minutes to read because there isn't much in it. The learning is hands-on with the machine.But, YOU MUST BE IN THE CAR WITH THE UNIT PLUGGED IN TO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER BEFORE YOU CAN TURN IT ON!That's right, folks. No adapter for in home use. You can't sit in your favorite chair, snap the unit on and learn. And the unit doesn't have any batteries so you can charge it up in the car and then take it with you when you step outside.While learning, I added three address to the Cobra and suddenly the unit was out of memory!Overall, a poorly designed product.I returned it. Won't buy a Cobra in future because of this one experience."
4,LAST DAYS OF A HUSTLER,"THIS IS A SUPER RARE CD-IF YOU LIKE FRISCO RAP THIS IS A MUST HAVE-RELENTLESS FLOW STYLES STR8 OUTTA HUNTERS POINT '97-FEAT.CWH,UDI & 11/5-SUM MORE OF THAT OAKDALE MOB SH.."
1,WARNING,"WARNING: apparently this book will cause you to adopt mallaby's incredibly condescending vocabulary, and cause you to refer to millions of people as being ""adolescent"" because of their country's economic difficulties.I haven't actually read this book, just judging from the above review."
3,"A sober, readable account on the Bank mission","I have read some books about Africa lately and I was interested in knowing the work made by the World Bank in this continent. Althought the book is focused in James Wolfensohn Presidency, this was a revealing reading that shows all the difficulties the Bank must face in order to provide the best aid to the target country and to keep the bank shareholders satisfied. Adding to that, the book describes the problems in the management of the Bank, its organization and inertia, the always problematics NGOs, and more importantly, the way to help countries in their ""economic development"", which is by far a very difficult thing to do. There is no recipe for that, you can establish a framework but there are other factors to consider in a case by case basis -- certainly reading Wolfensohn experience ultimately provide that, experience and knowledge. This is a well researched book, readable in its whole extension."
5,"Bizarre, erotic, powerful","This excellent and inventive erotic novel has at last been re-issued again by Nexus. It's one of the best in the Nexus series, a powerful and imaginative tour de force that has lost none of it's power since being first published in 1992. It skilfully entwines the stories of Lucy, a recalcitrant young woman sent to the perverse Institute as a punishment, and JK, a young man inducted into feminisation and submission. This is strong stuff, and Maria del Rey manages to write a novel that is by turns beautiful, obscene and cathartic. If you're interested in erotic fiction then this is one book that you need to read. Highly recommended!"
5,Oldies but goodies,"Another fine collection of nostalgic songs from the 1920's and 1930's. These songs were recorded WITHOUT today's overprocessed vocals, arrangements and other electronic ""tricks"". Today's singers can't hold a candle to these fine performers from another time."
5,Must See Film,"Trouble the Water is a MUST SEE FILM! I have viewed it many times and have shown it many friends and family members. Every single person I share this film with walks away changed. The in-time footage is breathtaking, the courage and kindness of the people during and after the storm is inspiring and the response of the government to this disaster is eye-opening! After watching Trouble the Water, you may be writing a check for the good people of New Orleans as I did, or at least you will be calling your friends and insisting they watch! Excellent film! Five Stars!"
5,Excellent.,This was a very thought provoking DVD. It made you realize how awesome the power of mother nature really is.
5,review of trouble,great and realistict i guess k. west said it best about bushs' relationship w/black people
3,"Troubling, but true","This video is an accurate depiction of what happened during Katrina and afterwards, as well as the life shared by many in New Orleans, I believe. But it is not one that I would share with many friends as the language is so crude, although real. The documentary itself, however, is well done. I know several of the participants in this video and this is the way they are!"
2,I DIDN'T ENJOY IT.,"A FRIEND RECOMMEDED THE FILM TO ME SO,I PURCHASED IT. I DIDN'T ENJOY THE DOCUMENTARY, AND I COLLECT DOCUMENTARIES.SJ"
1,What film were they watching?,"What film were these critics watching? What I saw was the beginning of a filmwith video shot by someone who obviously didn't know one end of thecamera from the other. Maybe it got better, but I gave up on it because of allthe dizzying amateur camera work."
5,Kay Starr ---fantastic!,"This was just like listening to Kay Starr back in the 50's on our radio. Great voice, clear recording, and very enjoyable to listen to."
4,Great Malian Blues,"The Malian singer/composer/guitarist scores again with a release full of the passionate, Afro blues music for which he is justly famous. He's backed by a small combo which includes accordion, harmonica, balafon and traditional percussion. It's rich , honest, and oh so good. He knows pain, and it comes though in his music. This release should appeal to fans of all blues, not just those that like world music. The more I listen to this, the more I love it."
3,"Good music, though not the best from Kar Kar","While I love Boubacar Traore and enjoy listening to this album, it is not my favorite. That being said, don't let my criticisms deter you from listening to it. Kar Kar and his fellow musicians have succeeded in making a new kind of music with this album -- a kind of Kayes-based world folk. All the non-African musicians who play with Kar Kar do a great job of playing those distinctive Kar Kar melodies, and yet the effect is something quite different than when Kar Kar plays with other Malians, as on ""Sa Golo"" or ""Macire."" It is not bad, in fact it is quite good, but it is also not what a fan of Malian music might expect.It is not this new type of music that makes me feel this is not Kar Kar's best, however. That opinion derives from Kar Kar's singing, which I feel sounds hoarse and weak compared to the strong smoky vocals of his previous albums. His guitar is still quite excellent however. My favorite track is the instrumental duet of guitar and harmonica."
5,Mood lifting music,"Actually I had never heard of Boubacar Traore untill I read a review of this cd in a Dutch magazine. I ordered a copy unheard (nice way to surprise oneself) and was not disappointed with what I heard.This is wonderful relaxed music with a warm African base but with definitely some jazzy and contemporary elements in it. Fabulous guitar play, wonderful voice!"
1,Terrible Noise,"Do not buy. I bought two pairs for my Mazda CX-7 SUV and after 60 days, I am having to buy new ones due to excessive noise."
5,Good showerhead,"For the price, this is a good, solid Showerhead. No problems and easy install. This was to repair a broken one in a rental, we didn't want to spend to much. But this did provide a nice upgrade for the owner. It doesn't feel cheap like others i have had in this price range."
4,Cheap but ok,I got it to install in an apartment I wont be in long. I didnt want to spend a lot of money. You get what you paid for. It does the trick.
4,"Pretty nice, reasonable price","Pretty nice shower head. Easy to install. A couple of different settings which are somewhat useful. Would be nice if the spray setting was bit more powerful, but definitely a good value. Recommended."
1,Broke after one year,"The mount for the handheld nozzle broke after a little more than a year of use, which essentially makes the shower head useless. Furthermore, the Amazon listing says the product has a ""limited lifetime warranty"" that the manufacturer is supposed to support, but after several hours of searching, I've given up on finding the manufacturer's contact information because my time is worth too much."
2,"good for pets, not for people","this is a minimal replacement for a peerless shower head that cracked, it has basically two setting, straight and almost straight, this delivers a stream about the width of the head, 3 in, and not much more. If you need to wash your pet this would be perfect, but since I put it in no ones uses the bottom shower anymore, just not enough coverage to be useful"
3,wont autofocus w/ D40,"I bought this as a gift, and was disappointed that it would not autofocus with the D40 (and a few other 'entry level' digital SLRs). Otherwise it worked well."
4,Great Len's,"This is a great multi-use lens for a hobby/beginner to intermediate photographer. I use this lens to mostly take pictures of my family. It has great range 18-250 (Minus the conversion factor, it's more like 24-300 I think). Have used it a little taking night shots and it works fairly well. Can't beat it for the price. I'm sure a professional could tell you a million things wrong with it. I haven't noticed any image distortion or fish-eye effect on any images.One thing, I removed the lens hood it came with. It was creating shadows at the bottom of my images.Great travel lens. If you can only afford to buy one lens right now, this is a great all around lens."
2,Be sure this lens is compatible with your camera!,"I bought this lens for my Nikon D5000. I did some research and read that it is compatible with my camera. When it arrived I found that the auto focus didn't work at all. I immediately got on the computer and started reading other reviews to discover that many other people had the same problem, or intermittent auto focus. After more research I discovered it was not compatible with the D60, D80 or D5000. I took it to a favorite hiking spot and took some photos with the manual focus. It performed well focus aside. During my shots there was a point where the auto focus worked for ten seconds. I took one picture with it activated, then went away never to be seen again.Auto focus issues aside this lens was good. Only downside is weight; it's extremely heavy considering no auto focus motor."
2,Not a lego favorite yet,"Bought this for a lego crazy 6 yr. old. First one didn't work even after I bought a new battery of it. Amazon was very helpful in sending a quick replacement which worked. My son just isn't that into it. It is hard plastic, not very comfortable. Not enough pieces to really change much around. No directions to attatch the heads. Maybe some day it will strike his fancy, but he is ignoring it for the real legos right now."
1,"Fantastic movie, won't play in DVD player","I've waited to see this movie since it came out in 1954 (?). It is just wonderful, music, acting, and all. Laurence Olivier is magnificent. BUT the DVD wouldn't play in my DVD player - which granted isn't the newest, but it plays everything else just fine. This disc skipped and dissolved into pixels. It worked in my MacBook but of course I only get a small screen. Amazon replaced the copy, but the copy wouldn't even start to play in the DVD player, all I got was ""disc error"".There's some kind of mysterious warning on the DVD, saying this: ""This disc is expected to play back in DVD video ""play only"" devices, and may not play back in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives"" - whatever that means.So I wouldn't recommend buying this DVD. Maybe somebody will create a workable copy, it would be worth it."
2,TOO BAD THAT IT'S A WARNER,"This film is GREAT FUN, it's the best filmed version of the 'Opera', it's only too bad that Warner has the copyright as their ARCHIVE pressing are ify at best. And just forget about that nice convenance called chapters, Warner doesn't know about them."
5,one of the most important books ever written,"This is one of the most important books ever written. It should be mandatory reading for all human beings. The wisdom imparted in Meditations will help one discover not only how to live a better life, but also what is truly important in life. An absolute must for everyone, especially those with a predilection for philosophy."
5,Wow...,"The little snippets of ideas represented in this book have been like a punch in the gut to me, philosophically, personally, in every way. Love it. Wish I could write more, but I don't have time; just wanted to make sure I put the five-star rating in here.""You may break your heart, but men will still go on living as before."""
4,The results are worth the prep time:,"Very user friendly recipes for the most part. I prepared the chili and the red pepper& lentil stew and they made for fantastic trail meals - actually, they were so good they wouldn't be out of place on the dining room table rather than the camp site. Anyone who's planning to make these meals on a regular basis really should invest in a dehydrator to save time, money and energy - the prep for my two meals took nearly 36 hours in a conventional oven. As I said though, the results were well worth the effort. Sure beats having peanut butter sandwiches or Mr. Noodles for dinner after an all day hike."
4,Not as sturdy as you'd think.,"After a month of heavy use, primarily as a chicken roaster, our French Oven dropped about 3 feet onto a carpeted kitchen floor. It landed on one of the long sides and cracked halfway down the side. It wasn't even warm at the time. However, it continues to serve us well. It's even useful for browning our pork chops on the stove top prior to oven cooking. All in all it's hard to beat Creuset."
5,We LOVE our Le Creuset French-Dutch Oven,"Bought the 6-3/4-Quart Oval French Oven for Christmas. As usual, Amazon customer service was awesome. Received the item on 12/22, and it was cracked in half! Called Amazon, and they over-nighted a replacement which I got on the 24th!So far, we've used our Le Creuset for baking bread, Beef Burgandy, Carbonnade, and Stroganoff. Has performed flawlessly. (Pretty easy when you follow good recipes from Cooks Illustrated!).I did order the metallic knob, and the Le Creuset cleaner. I would highly recommend both, especially if you are planning to cook break. The cleaner works only so-so. While the inside cleans easily, and burnt-on spots on the outside take a lot of elbow grease to remove."
4,OK Historic Sites,"This book is a series of profiles of over 100 historic sites in Oklahoma, written by Kent Ruth, whose newspaper column by the same name appeared weekly in the Sunday Oklahoman for many years.I particularly enjoyed the story of the ghost county seat of a ghost county -- Grand, Oklahoma. This ghost town is unique in that its former residents meet annually to recall memories of the once-lively town.The last two pages of the book contain directions on how to find each of the places described.Sunnye Tiedemann (aka Ruth F. Tiedemann)"
1,Boring,"I was very disappointed in this video. If your interest is in the geology of the park - geysers, mud pots,etc. then this is the video for you. I was interested in planning a trip to the park and wanted more info on a variety of tourist info. I was looking for tours of the hotels, restaurants, shops, museums, picnic areas, animal viewing areas, maybe some history, etc. This video shows many geysers,one then another then another then another, etc.and only a blip of a few other things in the park."
2,"So, it's just ok","Nothing much new in this book but I should have known that from a company like Better Homes & Gardens it would just be a review of old material. Don't get me wrong, I like B.H. & G., but from now on I'll stick to the magazines."
5,A few things you should know about 'For As Many As Will',"With beautful minimalist arrangements from Dolly Collins, and Shirley Collins' incredible voice, this is a first rate English folk album. Apart from a cover of Richard Thomson's 'Never Again' (a haunting piece about the passage of time), the songs are mainly traditional songs of Southern England. Especially worth noting is 'The Blacksmith Courted Me' (actually track five - there is an error in the tracklisting). The combination of sadness and resignation on this song of forsaken love is gut wrenching, and Shirley commented in an interview that it still breaks her heart. Because of this track alone I give the album five stars, but all the material is really good."
4,Defective CD Packaging,"I echo the feelings of others regarding the poor packaging of this collection. For the high price we pay for CD's, we deserve durable quality packaging to protect our investment.If you would like to let Rhino Records know about the issue regarding the defective packaging of this album, you can leave a voicemail with Mack from Rhino Records at (800) 546-3670. Leave a return number and he will contact you about a proper replacement."
3,Huh?,"What seems like a super collection of remastered Browne gems ends up as a super sounding collection of different than the actual album version Browne gems. Even the slightest fan of the actual albums will notice the difference in the versions on this compilation. Some of the tracks on this 2 x CD are either new versions or alternative versions that were done at the same time of the original recordings. I didn't notice this on every song, but several are different than the album versions. It is a similar feeling to those John Denver fans that had John Denver's Greatest Hits on 8 track and knew each song by heart and recently purchased a new 2 x CD Denver greats compilation and found that the songs were not the same versions you knew and loved! This is still a great compilation and it sounds incredible, but I would have liked to have a ""pure"" compilation culled from the actual albums...and where are ""The times you've come"" from For Everyman and ""Black and White"" from ""lives in the balance?"""
5,WOW!!,"Shortly and succinctly--this is quite possibly the best compilation of an artist's work that I have ever had the pleasure to listen to. The only possible emission I can think of is ""That Girl Could Sing"" from HOLD OUT. Otherwise this is just a great, great disc(s). If you are even a casual fan of Jackson Browne you must have this. Believe me....it will be money well spent."
5,Great album,"I've always been a Jackson Brown fan, but for some reason failed to purchase his work. This album is great!"
4,Doctor My Eyes...and my ears!,"This set is much better than the ""Next Voice You Hear/Best Of..."" single disc set but there seems to be a mystery afloat and is the reason for only four stars. In spite of the track listing in Amazon, the two disc set I purchased contains ""Lawyers In Love"" but ""That Girl Could Sing"" is missing. Another reviewer claims that Lawyers In Love is omitted. Did Rhino release different versions of this CD set to the public?"
2,Missing Key Tracks,"Why would an artist/label title a release ""The Very Best of..."" on any artist when some very obvious hits are missing? If this is supposed to be the definitive snapshot of Jackson Browne's career, why would such hits as ""Hold On"" and ""That Girl Could Sing"" be missing? Take a pass on this one. You're better off buying ""Hold Out"" and ""Running on Empty"" to own the best tracks from Mr. Browne's career."
5,Top notch!,"I love Jackson Browne's music! He seems so underrated buthe has a great singing voice! I got turned into a fan becauseof his hit from the movie Fast Times At Ridgemont High andI have been a fan since that time. My favorites are""Somebody'sBaby"" ""Take it easy"" ""Running on Empty"" are my 3 favoritesoff of this HUGE but great album. If you like singers thatcan actually sing you will want this."
2,Defective CD's,I purchased these disks and they were defective as the last tracks on both CD's would not play properly. I attempted to request a replacement but since MusicStore 2000 was not an Amazon supplier I had to get a full refund. I ordered a replacement from another supplier. :-(
1,Cheap Quality 2 CD Set,"I just bought this 2 CD set of the Very Best Of Jackson Browne on the day of it's March 16th release & Though there are great songs on this 2 CD set,it comes in a paper case all scratched & it skipped very good in my Stereo CD player due to not being set properly in a regular CD Jewel Case. Rhino Records could've did a better job producing this product!"
2,poor quality,"I ordered 3 music CDs, The Very Best of Jackson Browne CD I received was a new, not a used CD set. There is problems with both of the CDs, as some of the songs skip multiple times when played. I was happy with the quality of the two Gary Alan CDs I ordered at the same tim."
3,"so long Jackson, it's been good to know ya..","I recently bought a cd collection of a friend who passed and included in that collection were several Jackson Browne cds. While listening to one of them this morning, ""Roll Out the Guns of War"", I was privileged to hear Mr. Browne lyrically express his political position. Upon hearing I immediately ejected the disc and took it, along with 5 others, and dropped it in the trash. Mr. Browne is a performer and as such should just sing but like so many entertainers out there, he must feel that his political or religious opinions are somehow worth listening to. Newsflash Jackson, they are not so how about you just shut up and sing. If we want you opinion on anything of substance we'll ask for it."
4,2 Versions ?,"Finally. A well-rounded collection of Jackson Browne's hits and classics. But the day came that I went out to buy it I noticed the track listing was different from the one I had seen online.Upon researching this further I noticed that although they both had 32 tracks, there were 2 DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THIS CD. The track listing is slightly shuffled but while one version features THAT GIRL COULD SING, the other version neglects this rare and catchy gem for LAWYERS IN LOVE.I'm glad I took a good look at it before just running up to the register. Different stores seem to offer one version but none seem to carry both so be attentive if you're picky about your favorites like I am."
3,Jack's Back,"Finally there's a greatest hits but notably it's still missing some gems from his ""World in Motion"" album. Unforgettable songs like ""Enough of the Night"" & ""Chasing you into the Night"" are ommitted. The haunting ""My Personal Revenge"" should be included so the whole world will know of Browne's dedication of people's oppression when its put into music.Overall, a not too bad compilation.""My personal revenge will be the rightOf our children in the schools and in the gardensMy personal revenge will be to give youThis song which has flourished without panicMy personal revenge will be to show youThe kindness in the eyes of my peopleWho have always fought relentlessly in battleAnd been generous and firm in victory"""
4,It IS a compilation after all,"I haven't heard this compilation, but I have 25 of the songs on vinyl. I'd like to make two comments about the other reviews.First, Jackson Browne produced this set, so any complaints should be directed at him. He obviously picked the songs that he felt represented his best work.My other point is that this is a compilation. There are songs that I'd like to see included too (Song for Adam, Under the Falling Sky, I Thought I Was a Child, The Road and the Sky), but some songs would have to be taken off to make room for them. There is only so much room on a disc.If someone wants to have every great song Jackson Browne ever wrote or every song of his that they like they'll have to buy the individual discs or wait for the four disc box set, but those will be much more expensive propositions."
3,there are ways to get better sound on Jackson,"I have, also the following CDs from Jackson Brown, that result in a little better sound on most of his hits; Hold Out; Lawyers In Love;Running on Empty. the best of Jackson Brown on Elecktra. these seem to give me a little more coverage of Jackson Brown. Rihno does a fair Job, but sometimes, like a lot of re recordings of the hits, then producer and engineers need pay a little more attention to detail of the original sound, and, maybe that is what peaple want in a greatest hits CD."
5,"All ARE ""The Best Of..."" Tho' Where Are Songs I Love?","In My ""Running Days"" To Charlottesville, Va. A Cassette Of Jackson Browne Had To Be Included Or A Turn Back To Locate One. ""Late For The Sky"" Was My Introduction Into The World Of A Singer/Song~Writer That Simply ""Knew Me"". Some Of MY FAVOURITES Achingly Are NOT Here.So, I'd Rather Keep Collecting & Do My Own Lists Of ""Best Of"". Some Have Stated Not Very Prolific As Others.Glad This Is Someone That WAITS To SAY Something In Song That Matters.Yes, Music Has/Will Always Define A Decade Of Listeners & NOT A Generation. That Would Simply,Well, Not Hold Water.Give Me A ""Snappy Or Soulfull"" Well Written Song & I Am Gone. The Kind Of ""Lost"" That Does Not Come Around As Often As Once Used To Do So..."
5,Great taste but very fragile,I bought a case of 12 16oz boxes and am down to the the last four.While very tasty these crackers are so fragile that they're not much good other than adding a small slice of summer sausage or a smoked oyster on one.If you try putting peanut butter or other spread the cracker just breaks into pieces in your hand.When I reorder I'm going back to regular Ritz crackers...maybe that's the re reason they're on sale.
2,Not worth it,"Compared to all the other garbage trucks we have, this is the worst. The dumpster doesn't really go back far enough to dump trash in the back, nor is the dumpster removable (which makes my son not want to play with it). Also the design of the compartment where you dump the trash isn't good. The trash gets stuck under the back flap so they can't just dump it out. I wouldn't recommend this one. Matchbox has a really good one."
3,Not really necessary.,First let me say that I love Mothers reflections wax. Easy on and off and leaves a beautiful deep gloss. When I saw this addition to the reflections line recently I had to have it for my Torch Red Corvette. I now have to agree with a previous review that I found absolutely no difference before and after applying this product at all-- none. The mothers wax leaves such a nice shine there is no need for this product. Even beads water the same as before. Easy on and off product like the wax but will not use again.
3,NOT DURABLE,I'D GIVE IT 5 STARS IF IT LASTED LONGER BUT IT'S ONLY AS DURABLE AS MOST OTHER OTC PRODUCTS. IT IS EASY AND PLEASANT TO WORK WITH THOUGH.
5,Top Coat brings your car's look over the top!,"I used this over reflections wax, and the result is a deeper shine. I could see myself clearly in the reflection from my car's paint! I call that worth 5 stars! Give Top Coat a try if you want to improve the look of your car."
3,Not bad but not great,"I use dodo juice need for speed (best wax I have ever used, really easy to apply and remove with great results) and I normally top it with meguiars carnauba. I used this instead of the meguiars and I dont notice that much of a difference. This was also alot more work to put on and remove then the meguiars. It is thicker so its more of a pain to spread on. Removal wasnt the easiest either. You really have to add some elbow grease. Only plus side it does have carnauba and synthetic polymers so it last longer. This will be the last bottle I buy."
1,Not worth it!!,"Two reasons to avoid this sleeping bag:1. Insufficient insulation. This bag should NOT be rated for 20 degrees. I froze my tail off sleeping in it in 36 degree weather. The fill material is much too thin. I would recommend it for 45 degrees or warmer only.2. Impossible to store in its own compression storage bag. The bag is designed and built wrong. Once unpacked, it is literally impossible to replace into the bag. I had to buy a compression bag at a local camping store to replace the one that came with the product.I will likely not buy Slumberjack products again."
3,Could have bee MUCH better,"It's the only source for capturing the MotoGp season, but they could have added so much more. Why none of the post-race interviews? Why not some information on the racers and their motorcycles. There are on-board runs of each track, but a comentary by a rider on the subtlies of each track would have been great. As is, we get highlights from each race. Period. Nice when one has a monopoly on the material, isn't it?"
2,Good - but crazy expensive even at AMZ,"Look, I go through these things. I use them on disk sanders and dual action slash random orbit sanders to finish stainless steel, bronze, aluminum, etc. I have at least 3 disk sanders and 3 DA's as well as larger grinder sander polishers. The 3M yellow disks are pretty tough, but after a while they get nicked on the edges or just disintegrate from heat and stress. My problem is the price. This is an item that should cost no more than about $8-12. It's a small rubber pad with a screw mount. My go-to abrasive and metal working supply outfit sells them for $32 so I guess at $24 I shouldn't complain, but come on. At Harbor Freight you can get a new DA air sander (the whole power tool with a pad like this) for $30! I wish HF would sell knock offs of these but so far not. They would probably cost $6. Instead of these I am now getting the ones sold by Porter Cable which are just as good but closer to $20 here at AMZ."
1,whole language's foundation,"This is the book that began the ""end of literacy"" in our country. No wonder it is being sold for two bucks. It is worth less than that and in fact should be avoided as a poison."
5,Great Book,This Book is great has interesting team history stats easy to read if you like baseball history this book is for you
4,The baseball fanatic's bible!,I found this book to be a cornicopiea of information. You would have to go to five or six different sources to get sll of this information and it still wouldn't be as orderly and concise as this. A great fact-finder and a great read for the casual fan and the fanatic!
3,Good book but not the best,"This book is very good in numbers, obviously in biographies is very complete but the part of the franchise's history is very very VERY POOR. Focused only in the history of the team ""out"" to the ballpark.If you love the numbers its for you, a lot of important numbers, RBI, HR, ERA, W, SV, Etc. But if you love the photos or historical information this book isn't for you.In my opinion if the author works more in the historical part this book will be the best."
4,Mr. Clean would like this!,This is a very handy tool to have in your home. It will pick up just about anything and has very good suction. It loses a star for 3 reasons. It's too loud (it's actually louder than my upright vacuum). It's exhaust is too strong - to have good suction it must have good exhaust so expect for papers and other light weight items to be blown askew. And it has to be the biggest dustbuster made so it may be a bit difficult to hide. The pro's definitely outweigh the con's as it will clean well and it's batteries last pretty long.
1,Black & Decker Should be Ashamed,"Black & Decker is still using nickel-cadmium (NiCD) batteries, years after the much better nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries have become common. If you buy a Dustbuster, you'll be buying a new battery pack in less than a year. Black & Decker are so darn greedy that they do not even use a constant-current charger for the NiCD batteries (which this battery chemistry requires). They save 40 cents on the charger this way, and get to sell a LOT more batteries. Perhaps worst of all, NiCD battery packs in the landfill are quite toxic to the ground water. Buy a Makita vacuum instead - or at least, make sure the portable vacuum you DO buy has nontoxic batteries and a decent charger."
5,Most excellent,"I purchased this for work and it definately rocks. My office is often closed when the cleaning people come, so after a while, I am left to deal with the mountains of paper clips and paper scraps. And let me tell you, this sucks them right up.I have a lesser model at home that I bought on sale, and after using this one, I would definately spring the cost out of my own pocket. It is very powerful!The cost is somewhat steep. But if you use it all the time at home like I do, it is worth it. Which is why I am paying (yes, out of my own pocket) to get one for my home."
1,Junk,"Starts out strong, but the 'memory' that develops in the NiCad batteries renders the unit useless in a very short time. This is the third B&D I've owned over the last few years, and it will be the last unless they go to a new battery type (NiMH for example). I find it completely senseless to replace the entire vacuum every time the batteries wear out. Great for B&D profits, bad for B&D users."
2,Battery Fade,"This is a great unit for the first few months. It does in fact seem to be one of the more powerful units out there. But I've owned several of these and have noticed that the rechargeable batteries begin to lose their power after you've owned it for awhile. The vacuum starts out at full power but this only last for about 10 seconds, then the motor quickly winds down to almost nothing. This is too bad because it is a great machine otherwise. I would recommend against buying a B & D."
1,DustBuster Deluxe,Worked fine but battery life was terrible. I have searched high and low including the online store on the Black and Decker web site and I can't find replacement batteries anywhere. This is planned obsolescence at it's worst. Do they really expect me to purchase a whole new dustbuster just because the batteries on thbis one wear out. This is inexcusable. I'll never buy another Black and Decker product again!
1,Battery Replacement,Amazon should discontinue sale of this item as replacement batteries are not readily available.
1,Dustbuster 450 doesn't hold a charge,The Dustbuster 450 does not hold a charge. I have not found replacement batteries for the unit which has made it useless. Do not buy this product if you are looking for something that will work for more than a year. Lame . . .
3,"Good, for about two years...","This little guy was a fantastic Xmas gift that had gotten plenty of use; HOWEVER, at about warranty time, the battery became nearly useless. I bear testimony to the struggle of finding a replacement battery on the web (one place under many engines, toolguts.com). At twenty bucks of uncertainty for a new battery, I think I'll upgrade instead. I won't reward B&D for this behavior with a purchase, but rather seek alternatives. With two stories and a dog, I need something that will last 15+ years. Perhaps something with a couple of charge packs (like cordless drills) or with an alternative AC power supply when suck strength is too low and time too short for a recharge?"
1,Replacement battery difficult to find,"The Dustbuster starting losing charge after about a year. It was difficult to remove the battery from the housing. The instructions said to pull on the tabs and to strike the front of the product on a suitable surface to dislodge the battery. There were no tabs to pull up on and striking the unit did not do the trick. So with a screw driver and some pliers I was able to pry it lose. So after spending time getting the battery out, I was unable to find a nickel cadmium battery replacement so in the trash the vaccuam went. I will not buy another."
5,Loved This Gift,"My son was so pleased with these that he placed them on his car as soon as he opened them, leaving some gifts still unopened."
5,Caps economic Mustang accessory,These are an econoomic enhancment to any Mustang wheels. The finish blends well with both shiny and brushed wheels and the classic pony/bars emblem stands out.
1,Where's the other half of the book?,"There are many things left out of this book! Some examples that refer to files on the CD are not there, and some of those that are could not possibly be the correct ones. I am using this book for a class and I am constantly forced to look in other books to properly describe the information this book was supposed to cover. One error on the CD that was very upsetting was a practice test that did not have the correct answer for a question. Not very helpful! I've seen plenty of subpar books before, but this one takes the cake.This book has potential of being a good resource if the problems are corrected in a revision, but in its current state of poorly written material, misleading examples, and awful review questions/exercises I strongly oppose the use of this book in colleges.THOMSON or Standiford, if this book does get revised PLEASE use a more up-to-date version of AutoCAD to show examples. AutoCAD 2000 just doesn't cut it for a book released in 2005."
5,Best AutoCad book ever,The knowledge of the authors of this book unquestionably surpasses others. The wisdom and understanding that is displayed in this book goes far beyond any other I have seen. This book is manifestation that many years of experience played a fundamental role in the anthology of data. This is a must have book.
3,Sent the wrong earrings! But very helpful once contacted.,"I placed my order on May 1st, in plenty of time for Mother's Day. I received a package on May 4th ... and it was the wrong pair of earrings! I immediately called and was told I could keep the incorrect earrings at no charge, which was nice; and that they would immediately ship out the correct earrings for delivery on Monday, May 9th. Well, it's now Tuesday, May 10th and I don't have them yet. I called again today and was told they're in transit and they'll be delivered on Wednesday, May 11th. I obviously can't rate the earrings I ordered ... but I can say the earrings I received, which are black pearl studs (with no diamonds) are very nice!"
3,A dress rehearsal for her later successes,"This is a very early Cherryh novel about colonists on an alien world and their interactions with the catlike natives, centering on a young engineer sent to solve the colonists' problems, and his relationship with the young native cat-woman in scanty clothing on the cover. In this book you can see the beginnings of many of Cherryh's recurring themes, but the worldbuilding and character psychology in this novel lack the depth seen in other early works such as Gate of Ivrel, Faded Sun, and the Chanur novels. All in all I would only recommend this book if (like me) you absolutely have to read everything Cherryh has written."
5,A simple primer on freedom and capitalism and why it works,"My copy of this book dates back to the '70's. It pops to mind often when the more Liberal of our politicians try to solve economic discomfort through law.The joke that was the 'deregulation' of utilities in California, and the laughable solutions to higher oil prices offered by Democrats today make this book must reading.The problem is that since this book was written our children have received less and less education in economics, Americans actually believe left wing politicians who say they can manipulate the laws of supply and demand to the peoples' advantage.Chuck out the heavy reading of Adam Smith and Von Mises, this simple and concise book should be required reading in all High Schools. It may be the clearest and most easily understandable case for free markets in print."
3,Dr. Zuess meets Ayn Rand,"The vast majority of people, since time immemorial, favor insurance and dislike risk (and risk taking). That's how Warren Buffet got rich, and why the US leads the world in buying insurance. That's why people have centralized since the days of the Chinese emperors and Egyptian pharoahs. Economies of scale and lack of risk = Roosevelt style Big Brother government. It's what the people want--that's democracy. Wasn't it Mechken that said ""Democracy is giving the people what they want--good and hard?""Insofar as the poem goes, it's fun, ""Dr. Zuess meets Ayn Rand"" as somebody said. Not sure it's worth the price listed though."
1,poor recitation of Sabbath,Once again the Sabbath understanding has been relegated to any day of the week with no understanding regarding it's purpose. We burned the book.
5,"A good ""how-to"" book","Finally a Sabbath book that doesn't seek to convince one of which day should be kept as the Sabbath, but focusses instead on HOW to keep the Sabbath. The book is broken into four major parts - ceasing, resting, embracing, and feasting. Each of those chapter breaks its subject down into seven areas. For example, the section on resting covers physical, spiritual, emotional, intellectual, and social rest.You don't have to agree with the author or her experiences to see the value in taking 24 full hours off each week. I can testify that when I was both working and going to school, that 24 hours kept me sane and gave me something to look forward to.If you want to know which day is the Sabbath, this book isn't for you. (I would recommend Samuele Bacchiocchi's book ""From Sabbath To Sunday"" to treat this subject.) If someone is looking for ways to keep the Sabbath and experience the full blessing of God on this day, then this book gives many ideas."
5,Fabulous,This book captures the essence of Sabbath. Dawn explains well the benefits and effects Sabbath keeping has on the individual and the community. Her encouraging words and understanding nature caused me to long for the Sabbath and helped me to get back to the practice of Sabbath keeping. Thank you Marva Dawn for sharing your thoughts and for giving me the gentle push to get back to this very holy practice.
5,Very fun,My niece is in love with Lizards and these are so very cute. They all look different and are of very good quality. They also squeak which we didn't know. She adores them.
5,A favorite toy,"I prepare lessons for my preschooler. After we noticed some Geckos outside, she asked to learn about lizards. I bought these and taught her about one type of lizard a day for a week. These toys have such a good feel and are so attractive that they have been favorite toys ever since. She has cuddled to sleep the Komodo Dragon and she like to put them on her arm and pet them like she has seen at the zoo. We have a lot of play dates and all the kids are drawn to these lizards!"
2,Lonely Planet- Does Not Serve The Pusrpose,"Why we purchase LP ?Do get information and reliable people,recommendations when we visit other countries.Does it really serve the purpose? NO ! NO !Lonely planet is a book which when get's in print by then most of the information provided had been changed by variouus policies,change in currency or mention of business name in LP.Guest houses and people who are mentioned in LP cheats and overcharge people and take full full advantage of thier exposure and publicity they got from LP.THEN? What to do ?INTERNET !! INTERNET !!What for is internet? You can get information and relible resources to know what you want to know. Mere searching for 'trekking himalayas' in google.com -you can come to top 5 companies who operate in adventure and outdoor in Himalayas.Communicate directly when you book. Most people use PAYPAL which is safe and does not provide you threat of any cheating as they verify first about authenticity of thier merchant."
5,Great buy,I have tying for 10 years and have never been able to rotate my fly with my previous vises. This has been a great vise for the money.
1,Riverine: Brown Water Sailor in the Delta 1967,"The history surrounding Don Sheppard is incorrect. Don was actually the Commander of RIVRON 5, Section 51, part of Task Force 116.1, the most decorated unit in Viet Nam. Don did not usually participate in patrols.Every time he was on my boat PBR-39 was for a photo op. One time he was on the cover of the Navy Times with a flaming arrow starting hutches on fire with this primative device...bull...the guy not in the picture was behind me using a flame thrower, starting the fires. This is one of several instances for photo ops, the rest I will not indicate."
2,"Too much code, very little explanation","I really wanted to like this book, but it turned out to be just a collection of very long code fragments with no annotation and little explanation. There is a great topic here, and there are some good ideas, but the knowledge is locked in the code.If you are the type of person that learns by reading code then you will already have learned the APIs by looking at the sample code. The reason we buy technical books is to teach us how to use the APIs through a combination of well annotated example code, well organized reference material for the APIs, and illustrations that demonstrate best practice code flow. This book only has the code and a little explanation, the reference material, and effective illustrations are missing.I recommend this book only if you can't find any other material on MIDP2."
3,Code for a few j2me simple games with MIDP 2,"This the the right title for this book. It is basically a review of the code of a few simple games (like a cowboy jumping tumbleweeds, or a simple 2d maze) with very little space devoted to theory and explanations.. both of the APIs and of the internal logic and algorithms. Not that this book isn't useful.. it is but you have to wade through a lot of code, and I think the author could have done a much better job if for example she had taken the time to EXPLAIN the maze generation algorithms instead of just saying ""look at the code"". In short, more time and effort on the author's side, less on the reader.. and I think this book was written in very little time and with very little effort."
2,"Yankees don't know any better, so always be kind to them.","P. 131 statement. What a Southern Belle is not: a lady is never rude to anyone. Yet on the very same page the author quotes, ""Yankees don't know any better, so always be kind to them."" It appears a true blooded Yankee fits the description of a Southern Belle better than the author does. Her arrogant Southern mentality diminishes an otherwise good book."
3,good but hard to find,athe information in the book is good and sound but it jump around a lot and is hard to find thing quickly.
5,A Must Have,"This book is a true ""GIFT"". It is heartwarming, endearing and pratical. Every Home should have a copy. I just looked through the book for the first time and have already bookmarked several pages. This is a book to savor and keep forever. Thank you Mirian Lukken for such a wonderful, homey book!!!"
1,The worst tarot book ever!,"This must surely be the worst tarot book ever written.Totally banal, especially the section ""101 frequently asked questions."", these are supposed to be psychic questions e.g. ""My boyfriend smokes. ......Is it unreasonable for me to ask him to quit smoking?"".?????!!!! And most of all the book is stupendously overpriced, with very little helpful information at all; and a misleading title as well."
4,Great beginner insight,"I started with another book and then read this one, but it was most helpful. I was able to learn basics and get a better insight to tarot cards and psychic reading."
4,Get paid for Readings,"Great beginners book. Easy to read and understand. Great for at home telephone readers, email now to start working."
4,"Nice material, well made, and cute and funny","This toy from the Wallace and Gromit collection does not dissapoint. It is neat and clean, with a slightly sheeny fur smoother and softer than the usual stuffed animal, and the nose sticks out a ways. Its cute and funny. Good little valentine extra."
3,:(,the clips are a joke i cut them off and use metal clips off a kmart stringer works well the scale is ok for the price prob would not buy another one
4,"A Custom 15"" fast crash","I got this cymbal this past Christmas, and it's a pretty decent cymbal. I only say decent because it's not really for my style of play, so this review is kinda biased, but I'll tell you about it anyway. It's extremely thin and flexible, and creates a very high-pitched, bright sound. It's a beautiful sounding cymbal for the most part, but i play hard rock and metal so this cymbal didn't really fit in...as a primary crash at least. This thing is actually higher pitched than my 10"" splash, so I'm actually going to start using this as a big splash/effect cymbal. Overall it's a really nice cymbal with great sound, and I'm sure it will serve me just fine as an effect cymbal"
4,Nice quality,"Good quality, good stitching, semi waterproof plastic type material, nothing flashy, but who needs a flashy bathroom bag?Actually, I got this little bag for my dog grooming tools, and it has held up well to scissors and steel rakes, etc. Quite durable! Nice little bag, useful for all sorts of things.This would be a good size for a toiletries."
3,"Ensign Peak Toiletry Travel / Shaving Bag, Black",It works as a ditty bag put into my old bag. It was what it said it was... no more.. no less.
2,Large but Cheaply Made,This is nice and large but the material is super thin and I can't use it as it won't hold up against any serious wear.Order at your own risk.
1,crappy POS,"i bought this along with a haier 7"" portable tv. well to start off with the thing is made out of cheep plastic and some verry thin alunimum. it broke the same day. the tv fell off of it and the knob on top just snaped right off and after that i was just playing with the legs and whatda ya know they broke off also. in the end i would not reccomend this product to any one. but then agen you do get what you pay for.allmost"
2,Universal 8 Inch Mini Tripod,OK so this thing is very small and very cheap! Both price and quality wise its cheap. I could break it with little force. I was hoping for rubber feet as I would not like the thing to move while I'm recording with it. It has plastic feet. Also the swivel can move around even when the bolt on it is fully tightened. I'm not buying another one of these. I just hope my amplifier doesn't blow the thing away! Buy something else.
3,Not for every model,"I have Casio Exilim and it's light enough to work. I would imagine this flimsy thing would work only on small to mini cameras only. Oh, and make sure you have a slot in the dead center otherwise it will easily tilt. 3 stars for the price."
1,Don't buy this item!,"This item is mostly plastic and not made of quality material. It would not be able to hold your camera securely. The screw to tighten the ball joint can't tighten. It's very disappointing. Perhaps, the price should have given me a hint."
4,Must Read,"Sometimes it's easy to see racism and prejudice in today's world, but Pieces of Silver shows us up front and plain-faced the prejudices rampant when America was young. Then, racism wasn't only about the color of someone's skin, but their name and country of origin. Not only does Pieces of Silver show us the struggles of a young America, but it teaches us about forgiveness, tolerance and God's love. A great story. - author of Pursued By Evil, A Dream Fulfilled and Haunted By Evil."
4,True-to-life portrayal,"I was hooked from the first page. My family has stories they've handed down from WWI, so I especially enjoyed this book. Lang brings to life a forgotten era, a land of immigrants, and Americans divided in their loyalties. Danger and intrigue were around every corner. Lang's true-to-life portrayal of the tension that dominated America during those years made it impossible for me to put the book down. I read into the wee hours of the morning to finish it."
5,Children TBI,A really great useful book written in a way that's easy to read and understand.Many helpful suggestions.A must have book for parents of kids with TBI.Wonderful book
5,Hot Wheels Acceleracers Vol. 3 - Breaking Point,Another great movie for my two boys to watch. They can't wait for volume 4 to be released.
5,HW dvd,"If your son just loves the Hot Wheels, they will love the movies. We have the whole collection. Love the graphics, characters, action, and music."
1,Important information,"I bought this to clean my shower stall tub enclosure and floor tile.It has a fiber pad simular to commercial floor buffers. The problem is, when you apply pressure onto what your cleaning the head stops rotating. This is really very little pressure to scrub rendering it useless to me. I charged the battery fully and don't know why other people rate it high. It could scour sink basins with light pressure but don't expect it to do any tough cleaning, you're best to use your hands or buy a universal polisher/buffer."
5,SCUMBUSTER!,"A good friend of mine introduced me to the Black and Decker ScumBuster. She is now my BEST friend. I think all of the busy women and men in today's society should own one of these tools. With all of the cleaning brushes and scrubbing pads, it cuts down the cleaning time around my household by at least half of the original time I was spending cleaning the kitchen, bathroom, tile floors and even my automobile(s). I give this product a 5 star rating. How did I ever get my house so sparkling clean without it?"
2,Sadly dissapointed,"After waiting a long time to buy the Scumbuster, I am sad to report that I was very dissapointed in the performance of this item. The directions said to charge the battery for at least 6 hours, so to be sure I let it charge overnight. I went to use it in my shower the next day and it had no real power, went very slow and was out of power in about 2 minutes. Maybe I just had a bad battery, hard to tell."
4,Why didn't I buy this sooner?,"I kept looking at this product on your web site, but hesitated to buy it because of the other review that rates it the ""scummiest handheld tool I own."" Well, I'm so glad that I didn't listen and purchased it, anyway, because I LOVE it! In my pre-ScumBuster days, I avoided scrubbing the tub and tile at all costs. . .now I faithfully whip out the ScumBuster once a week. My grout has never looked so good. I highly recommend this to anyone that doesn't enjoy bathroom cleaning. It will change your mind completely."
1,Scumbuster: Am I Missing Something??,"I bought this tool on the recommendation of a trusted advisor, who absolutely loves hers. It has a slow turning motor, and minimal battery life, even using the ""60% Longer Life"" (NOT INCLUDED) batteries. Using several different attachments and cleaning solutions, I was unable to any better job removing soap scum from ceramic tile than with a scouringpad-backed-sponge and my hand. The concept is sound, but the tool is, in my opinion, weak and practically ineffective. If they made an ""Industrial Model"", with a 12 or 18 volt battery pack (instead of the dinky 3.6v), that would be a tool worth having. Save your money."
1,A waste of Money,"I tried scrub buster twice but it has become a dust collector. Its one of those gadgets that sounds like a good idea but it just doesn't live up to its advertising. Battery life won't get you even half way finished cleaning the shower. It doesn't have the power to scrub hard enough to achieve a good result. I find that its faster, easier, and less hassle for me to scrub by hand...and the result is far better. I will give my scrubbuster away free to recover the shelf space it wastes. I am really shocked to read that anyone found it useful."
2,Where for art thou accessories,"It appears as a nice product for using, but while be lured to buy the product the accessories are no able to be found anywhere????"
3,Ok if you've got everything clean already...,"I like the scumbuster. Key word being: Like. It wasn't nearly as powerful as I thought, and I found myself going back to scrubbing tough stains out by hand. If I pushed down hard with the scumbuster, it'd just either stop, or else strain and go slower. I must admit though, I find it works well for maintenance. I clean everything by hand really well when it needs it, and to maintain it, I zip over it with the scumbuster. I don't regret getting it, but it definitely didn't do what I imagined."
1,"Fairly good when new, now dead = trash?","I've had and used the Scumbuster for about a year now, mostly for bathroom cleaning. When new, the unit charged up and ran well, though it was small and fairly slow. My battery life was only about 20 minutes before it was useless. Not really enough time to thoroughly clean the tile AND grout lines in my 3-wall, completely tiled standard 5' tub.It did well around the pool tiles, though again, battery life would not last long enough to complete the job.As the unit got older, battery life kept falling off and today it no longer works at all. My unit does not have a replaceable battery, so now it's trash?Nice idea, just not powerful or long-lasting enough to do the real job it was made for. Perfect for toilet bowl cleaning, not up to the longer tasks of a complete tub surround or pool tile. I also expected it to last longer than a year before having to throw it out. I won't buy another one."
2,Scummy Scum Scum-Takes 3 In A Tub!,"I do not like to put down any product, especially one given to me as a gift--yet, my scumbuster is now out in the garage somewhere. You know, among all the other tools and handly little gadgets that you might use once or twice but on the 3rd strike--it's outta here! The premise is wonderful. The product is powerless. The batteries do not last, it takes more arm motion & patience than I care to use.Now, I must admit, for odd items, such as aqauariums & whitewall tires, it did do the job. Possibly I have a higher dirt load than most. I agree with other reviewers, a scrub pad and some suds are better helpers and better priced, especially after factoring in the cost of batteries."
4,Gold mining aid.,I like to prospect for gold. This tool really does the job of raking out the rocks and leaving behind the dirt. It has held up fine so far. It has seen a lot of rough use. Bottom line is I would buy another.The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I don't know how it compares to other brands.
2,Not what I was looking for,"In the 80's my parent bought me this glorious well-proportioned coffee table book of natural and man-made world wonders, that opened with 7 pages on the original 7 wonders....it was a huge inspiration to me as a kid growing up. THIS BOOK AIN""T IT...its about the same size, has similar font on the cover and a pic of the indian thing.....BUT ITS NOT THE SAME. Its thin. And weird....much more flowery descriptions of places, more of a 70's version of the very yankee/practical descriptive/OBJECTIVE version I enjoyed and was looking for. Still okay, but the one I enjoyed was much better....though the binding on the one I was looking for fell apart on the first two I bought, so maybe this 70's version holds together better. not sure if they're written by same people or published by same, but they're not the same. this one is old and almost a third the size and pages....still tall and wide, but not very thick."
2,A little disappointed!,"Not much of a story line, kids not very interested in book! Images re nice but all in all a disapointing book!"
3,Great Neck 8 Piece Turning Tools,"After purchasing these tools one of the steel bits fell out of the handle of one of them when I removed them from the package. I decided to ""pin"" the steel bits to the handles with 1/4"" spring pins approximately 1/2"" from the edge of the circular metal ferrules on the end of the wood handles. The wood is hard and the metal drilled ok. Now I like these tools even though re-sharpening is often."
5,Bought as a gift,Bought for an old friend who is in retirement and turning is a profitable hobby. His use has been positive and his appreciation for the quality made the purchase a happy occasion.
4,Nice set,"Good set for a reasonable price. No they aren't the top of the line, best quality you can get, but they aren't $300 or more either.I've used them on both hard and soft woods as well as some plastics and resins. They will need sharpening from time to time, but they take a very nice edge pretty quickly and easily. You can buy harder steel that might take a bit more abuse, but they are also far more difficult to sharpen well.Maybe if I did this kind of work everyday, I might opt for more expensive tools, but I've found these to be a very good value for the price and the performance."
2,Garelick 50 hp motor stand,"I purchased the stand to support a 3.5 hp motor for transportation in my toy hauler RV. My initial impression was that it was flimsy and the stand was priced way over what it was worth. The legs are tubular aluminum and supported by crossbraces that require removal and replacement of two wing nuts when the stand is expanded or collapsed. I would have preferred hinged braces.The mounting bar appears to be painted compressed fiberboard or recycled plastic, I do not know if it will stand up to weather. It does support my 60lb motor when stationary. I would be supprised if it supports motors weighing much more than 60lbs and I am afraid to use it bolted to the deck of my RV for travel."
5,A great EP- whets the appetite.,there's lots of stuff to say about the arcade fire and funeral so i'll just say that this is a good ep and its feels nice to hear some new stuff after playing funeral over and over and over again.
4,excellent seminal work,"This ep kicks butt. There are a couple of songs that feel a little experimental, but overall I think it's quite good, particularly since this is the beginning of their career.It's not Funeral, but something unto itself. You know it's AF by the sound but is a different entity than Funeral.Get it !!!!"
3,Blueprint,"On this introductory EP, you can hear The Arcade Fire in the process of discovering both their sound and their theme (which, it seems to me, is community). And much as I love Funeral (the best debut by anyone in years), they aren't quite there yet. Whereas the songs build and shapeshift and work cohesively on Funeral, these 7 cuts run out of steam halfway through (meaning halway through the song, not the EP), and the women -- lovely as counterpoint on Funeral -- are too much up front here."
2,Worst of Arcade Fire?,I was really excited by being introduced to some of Arcade Fire's latest work (Neon Bible) so I bought this and was amazed at how bad it was. There is like one song worth keeping the CD for and the rest is like a bad rehersal.
4,The start of a great experience,"Arcade Fire at its origins; pure, innocent and on its way for something different. The melody, the evolution, the clouds and the sun. Arcade Fire is like life :it's an experience of tries and mistakes... but at the end, it's a wonderful experience.(apology my english)"
5,There's no smoke without . . . Arcade Fire,"This is an amazing EP. I had been listening to Funeral, the band's so-called ""debut"" LP for many months before discovering there was an EP before the LP. I expected something rougher, kind of like a rough draft to what later becomes a great novel. But the EP was as polished as the LP. The only difference I noted was the songs tend to be more of the contemplative, quiet type found on Funeral, and not so much the post-punk anthemics such as ""Wake Up."" If you like Arcade Fire, this EP is a must. The songs are beautiful, the string arrangements breathtaking, the vocals emotional, and the overall effect incredibly polished for a young band's first EP. Now I'm even more psyched that I'll get to see this band live on Sept. 21 here in Seattle."
5,Affairs of a Beauty Queen,I'm enjoying every book I received and adding to my collection. I was impressed with the quick sending of the purchase and the perfect condition it was in.Nancy Gooding
3,Great for the car but not the living room...,I've had this vac for awhile and though it is great for cleaning out the car it doesn't work very well when trying to clean anything out of your well traveled carpet or kitchen for that matter. Though you'll experience some success cleaning up after yourself in the kitchen I would buy this exclusively for your car and maybe for some hard to reach areas in your home.
3,batteries,"Black & Decker cordless vacuums are great for the kitchen or on bare floors(no carpet)which is what is was intended for. The problem comes after 2 to 3 years when the batteries can no longer hold a full charge, runs down before you are finished. The battery pack cost about $16.00 + shipping. You would be better off buying a new vacuum."
2,Good for lightweight usage but that's about it,"We purchased this to keep in the kitchen by our cat dish to pick up the dry food that got on the floor. That honestly is about all it picks up. It lacks suction and the power runs out on it very quickly, after just a few short term uses. We are already searching for a replacement (not a Black & Decker) as we are just not at all impressed with it's lack of usability and convenience. Definetly not money well spent."
2,Needs more power,I bought this Vac to keep near the cat box as my cats appear to actually throw litter onto the floor for fun. Its not very powerful but will get some of the litter. Now I find myself using a broom in-between BIG vaccuming as this doesnt do the job well enough. Buy this if you need an item to put you into the free shipping price category. (its like getting it for free)
1,antenna that does not fit radio,"standard STD-CAT460 Replacement Antenna For Most Handheld Radios . this antenna does not come even close to fitting my radio. I have to have an antenna with 7/16"" male threads or same diameter female threads according to drill gauge I measured with. It is completely useless to me. I would have sent it back if I had not forgotten to take it with me when I passed the ups store.It definately will not fit a hummingbird brand handheld marine radio.I have purchased any other items from amazon that I remember.I can only give this product a zero rating because I cannot use it."
3,Not for an experienced battleship reader,"If you are new to battleship books or buying one for someone who is new to them, then I would recommed this book. If you are an experienced reader of battleship books and have many like me, then skip this book. You won't find anything new here. The text and most of the pictures are not new. Contrary to the editorial reveiw there are no cutaways and blueprints. The editorial review also described the book as a pictorial history with archival photos. Though the book does contains lots of pictures, most have been published in other battleship books. The Library of Congress Photographic Division and Naval Historical Society have hundreds of beautiful, never before published photos of US battleships. I was hoping this book would show some of them in large format."
1,A confused mish-mash of stuff on reincarnation.,"This book should never have been written, as it contributes NOTHING to the literature on reincarnation.It is a confused mixture of tidbits from superstitious lore, mystic speculations, senseless stories, from which one can see the autor's general confusion on this whole topic. A waste of time, in every way."
4,wipe on - wipeoff,"This is for people like me that don't like to wax but know they should. It goes on and off very easy, leaves no residue on plastic trim. It's hard to tell if you missed any spots on a white car when applying. Only time will tell how long the protection will last.updated review ...it does not last"
5,The mother of all car waxes,"After reading the reviews, first time I had tried this wax....and its totally great, easy to put on and easy to take off....you really don't need a buffer to get it off and leaves a very nice shine on the car.....and it doesn't smell that bad....."
5,Easy to use,"My neighbor recommended Mothers after seeing it on all the car shows. It is super easy to use; really, I can't imagine waxing being any easier. Also it really helps the car stay clean. Nothing (bugs, etc) sticks to it. Very pleased; will order again."
2,Very mediocore bag.,"I have this bag which is now a few years old. I bought it for a entry level bag bag to use for backpacking etc., The big problem is that the 20f rating is pretty far off even when using a good thermarest. From my experience, even though 20f is a survival rating, using this bag in anything below high 40f's you will be in for a very cold night(this is coming from someone who likes to sleep slightly cold).Also the zipper only goes halfway down which can make it difficult to get in and out, and makes the bag feel really small."
2,Temperature Rating Is Very Optimistic,"I bought this sleeping bag because it compressed nicely into a 7.5 x 12 inch sack. It works well in temps above 40 degrees. However, in a tent with a thermarest pad, at below 40 F, I got cold, even with some thermal underwear. I would be very careful taking this bag into temps below 40."
1,Temperature Rating is Inaccurate,"This sleeping bag seems like a really good deal with the temperature rating, but still being small and lightweight. However, it's not worth it. The temperature rating on this bag is no where near 20 degrees. It should probably have around a 45 degree rating. It's a good, compact sleeping bag, as long as you are aware of the temp discrepancy before you buy it."
2,"40 degrees, not 20",May be a great bag for mild fall/spring weather. Just don't use it if any temp under 40 expected.Got caught in the appalachians in 10-15 degree weather... Spent the night in all my clothes/coat and emergency blanket on thermorest in 3-wall trail shelter but still shivering uncontrolably
2,"Packs small, but terribly cold.","I like to sleep fairly cool. But I wore a base layer to bed and was freezing in the mid-40s. I've taken this bag several times and the experience has been the same. I have no idea how they can say it's 20 degrees. If I were climbing into this bag in 20 degree weather with no base layer, I would have real safety issues.Also, even if your core is warm, the foot of the bag is always cold. Always. Even if you wear snowboarding socks.It does pack small and light, so I give it credit for that. But I'd look elsewhere if you can."
1,No way is the 20 F rating correct.,Used in 26 degree weather with fleece and socks. I would have frozen if I wouldn't have boiled water and put in lexan containers then wrapped them in fleece. While trying to keep warm near the fire. The sparks easily burned little holes when they hit the nylon shell. In warm weather it would be fine.
1,This isn't a book.,"This isn't a book. This is a nine-page pamphlet in an 8X11 format, and for $23.95 (with shipping) I've been sorely ripped off. The coverage of the subject matter is cursory at best, and the outline format of the text serves only to insert a blank line between each two lines of text, and to make reading awkward."
2,It should be called NO hold hairspray.,"I wanted a hair spray that holds a style and I could comb through without feeling as though I'm damaging the hair. This product allows me to comb through, but it doesn't hold a style! It needs more holding power. I'm disappointed."
5,Love these,this is part of a series of books and I was enveloped into the story from the beginning I enjoy reading books that have plot and excitement within the pages ... top story from Jodi Thomas
1,Twilight In Texas,"$13.68 for a USED PAPERBACK plus S&H;?????? REALLY??????????????? This is the only Jodi Thomas book not on Kindle. WHY???I rated this one star ONLY because it's $13.68 for a USED PAPERBACK plus S&H.; I haven't had the pleasure of actually READING this book yet, nor will I pay the outrageous asking price of a USED PAPERBACK!"
3,Twilight in Texas by Jodi Thomas (Large Print),"Description from the book dust jacket:""I have to board. This is my train."" He smiled down at her, memorizing her face. ""But I must have your name before I go. I'll carry it with me until this war is over. Then I'll find you. I swear, I'll find you."" ... ""Molly,"" she whispered, then shouted above the crowd. ""Molly Donivan."" ""Molly,"" he whispered ... ""Do you believe in love at first sight?"" ""I'm starting to,"" she answered ... He was a Southern spy behind enemy lines. She was a Union General's daughter. And it was love at first sight, sealed with one passionate kiss. War kept them apart for eight long years - until Wolf Hayward, now a Texas Ranger, lands on Molly's doostep, wounded. Molly doesn't recognize him, but finds herself attracted to his kindness. When she discovers the truth, can they find the love they thought was lost?"
3,"An ""ok"" product... but how long will it last?","I found it easy to install on my Bosch Colt tilt base, I don't see how anyone could break something while putting it on.The plastic ""ears"" that straddles the base clamp flanges is indeed on the thin side and gave me the impression of being prone to breakage if too much pressure is placed on them by an overly tight base clamp, so I backed off the clamp locknut a bit to reduce the pressure.I don't think this base cover will hold up under the rigors of a professional installer/craftsman, but it should do fine for us weekend garage warrior types. And if it doesn't... then I'll try a few strips of 3M non-skid safety tape on the aluminum base."
2,Heavy Bible agenda should be noted,"No where on the cover, or on the back cover, does this workbook mention that there's a ""Bible Study"" section of each chapter. Previous reviewers have danced around this politely by mentioning ""scripture-based"" and this is a disservice to the broader audience of Amazon.com.This workbook should never appear as ""another choice"" with other manners books. It belongs in religious books and cross-linking with the likes of ""365 Manners Kids Should Know"" is shameful. If I could return it, I would.Good manners are not the exclusive province of Christianity."
1,RUBBISH! NOT WORTH THE ONE STAR REVIEWING FORCED ON ME,"THERE WAS NO WARNING THAT THIS BOOK TRIED TO RELATE GOOD MANNERS TO THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE. AS IN POLITICS, THE TWO SHOULD NOT BE PARTNERED. CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT GOOD MANNERS WHATEVER THE FAITH OF THEIR PARENTS/PARENT/GUARDIAN ETC AND SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO BE POLITE TO PEOPLE OF ALL OR NO FAITH. THIS BOOK COULD BE VERY OFFENSIVE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CHRISTIAN, APART FROM BEING USELESS. I HAD INTENDED TO READ THE BOOK MYSELF AND THEN GIVE TO A 6 YEAR OLD GIRL ~ I DONATED IT TO GOODWILL."
2,motor cycle garage mat,"This product is basically a strong piece of tarp with tough plastic edges that you snap together to hold the tarp in place.I probably didn't do enough research on this item before purchasing so I was disappointed. I have had this for about a month now, still no tears in the plastic. When this one does finally give out I won't purchase a new one, I'll try to save some money next time and purchase a plastic cover / mat / or even cheap carpet from a hardware store."
3,Amazon should list voltage with handheld cordless vaccuums!,"I returned this as soon as it came because the box said it was 4.8 volts, and B&D makes a 9.6 volt (albeit not a wet/dry) cordless handheld vaccuum. i wanted the most power i could get, and assumed it would be in the ""deluxe"" model. i decided to forget about the wet feature because after reading the instructions i learned that after vaccuuming wet spills you need to rinse the filter (sponge) and the collection bin each time. OK- for that much trouble give me a paper towel!"
1,Hoover is a much better product,"I liked the look of this new Dustbuster. So I ordered one and learned that it is all style and no substance. The suction is inadequate for even light duty jobs. And this vac is so loud it scares the dog. The hoover unit is quiet, powerful and feels better to use and hold."
3,Ahh,"I like it because its like a dictionary but its from spanish to english, not english to spanish. So as a fluent english speaker, its hard to interpret. Other wise, its good to look up words you dont know in spanish."
5,"Great, small book!",I love this book! It is very easy to use to help increase one's spanish vocabulary!
2,Key Attribute Missing,"I purchased this booklet because I was looking for a short-cut in learning some key Spanish words. Though it does cover that subject well, the pronunciation of each word is left up to the reader. I can't say I've ever had a ""dictionary"" that didn't provide that attribute. So perhaps I was ""too quick to pull the trigger""? Or should it be noted in the product description that no pronunciation is provided?"
2,No Help with Pronunciation,It's a nice list of words but has no indication of how to pronounce these words. I guess I expected it to be more than a 1/4 inch thick 50 page paperback. An OK deal for the low price (2 bucks).
2,I would say its worth the three dollars.,"I need to learn spanish but do not have the time for school...this book will give you spanish word with the english word next to it, its basically a english/ spanish dictionary,but does not show you haw to pronounce them. The biggest PROBLEM with this book is it has the spanish words first and in alphebitical order not the english words! So unless you know spanish you have to skim the entire book to find the word you need!"
2,Dumb idea,"I paid one penny for this book. That's all it's worth. The ""useful words"" are in Spanish. How useful is that...unless you're translating.If the words were in alphabetical order, in English, with the word written in Spanish after that, THEN it would be helpful. What a waste. I'd send it back but the shipping was $3.99."
1,Overpriced,"I bought this as a gift for my Aunt and Uncle and was shocked to see that the original price is $1.00, yet Amazon charged a lot more for it. Not a very useful book, but if you want a cheap little guide, it fits the bill."
4,Very useful,"This is a very useful book for review or for a quick check to see if you remember a word correctly. Having done several audio courses (Pimsleur I and most of ""Learn Spanish in Your Car""), I was amazed at how many of the words I already knew. I keep it next to the TV to scan during commercials."
5,Spanish On The Go,I like this book. It's probably the only Spanish book that I foundthat's so small that I can put it in the back of my pocket and takeit everywhere I go. But you will need a good Spanish course to goalong with it. I am doing the Learning Spanish Like Crazy digitalcourse and the live teleseminars. Speaking one-on-one with theSpanish instructor at the LSLC live teleseminars helps alotpronouncing the words that I am learing in 1001 Most Useful SpanishWords. You can also get a Spanish speaking friend to check yourpronounciation.
3,"Handy, but out of date","This is a nice little book and you can't beat the price. However, many of the phrases are no longer useful in today's culture. If it were updated, it would be highly useful for the casual tourist."
5,Useful indeed.,"Imagine what you could do if you knew 1001 spanish words. Not much you say? Well what if you knew not just any 1001 Spanish words but the 1001 most useful Spanish words! Now you are on your way to conducting the most fascinating conversations of your lifetime. Imagine if you were hanging out in some diner and you saw Shakira walk in...wow! Without this book you wouldn't be able to ask her ""Where is the bathroom?"" or ""How many shoes do you have?"" You'd be stuck with your jaw drooping in your eggs wishing you had read this book."
1,Not what I expected,"I purchased this book due to the reviews; but, this seems to be better for someone who speaks spanish and wants to learn english. The words are all sorted based on the spanish language and it's not easy to find words that you'd like to convert from english to spanish. If I knew the spanish word the book makes it easy to translate to english. I wish I hadn't purchased this one..."
1,This book is not what I thought it was,"This book is set up so you look up the word in Spanish, so it is for people who already know some Spanish or for translating. It didn't work for me."
5,great idea,What a great idea and why has no one come up with it before? Learning the phrases that you are most apt to use will help the student or traveler!
2,simple,"this book has all the basics. Good morning, good night, how are you. Most people know this already. If you are going to a spanish country and staying in a nice resort then this book could help. but if you want to learn to speak spanish this is not a very good book for you."
4,More Than Enough Spanish for One's Money (or for the Size of the Book),"This tiny book is an excellent compilation of Spanish vocabulary. The reader does not get lost in a number of alternative explanations for the same word. Often the most frequent usage of each word has been given in one or a few words. A complete sentence in Spanish demonstrates the word's usage. An English translation of the sentence comes as a bonus.The book is very handy for a quick look up under time pressure, for a review of the vocabulary, or for refreshment of memory without any apparent reason: just randomly select words and go through them at your convenience aboard an airplane, at a subway station or in the bed just before falling asleep. It is, however, not a dictionary. It can only complement a full-fledged dictionary such as Oxford's or Collins' Spanish dictionaries.Given its size and price, I recommend this little big book to everyone who considers to start or has started learning Spanish."
3,Make sure you need it before you buy it.,"If you've taken more than one semester of Spanish in school, this book won't be able to help you much. For me (my wife is Mexican and I have learned a lot from her. I have also completed up through Spanish 201 in college), this book did not teach me a thing. However, for my grandma who has no experience with Spanish and wanted to learn some voculary words in order to communicate easier, this book was perfect. This book could be one of the most useful you have or one of the most useless, depending on who you are and at what level of Spanish you are at. Make sure that you need it before you buy it, but for two bucks you can't do much better if you are looking for a good vocaulary list."
2,Useful?,"I bought this to use as a quick reference guide on a recent trip to Mexico. While it did have some useful words, others were just not there. It was an inexpensive little book, but in the end I wished I would have just bought an English-Spanish dictionary, or an electronic translator. Also, the words are alphabetized in Spanish, so unless you know what Spanish word you are looking for, this isn't going to help too much."
3,Not Bad for Two Bucks,"Not as good of a deal as the 770 Basic Phrases, its sister book. Its spanish first. I guess if you wanted to look up the meaning of a word you heard on Telemundo it might not be a bad book, or just open the book everyday and pick out a word of the day. Not quite the value as the other book but still not bad."
3,1001 Spanish Words,"Very useful book, however I found the pages to be of a low grade. The book looks like it will oxidize quite quickly. Otherwise, the content is very, very good and useful."
1,1001 reasons why this is a waste of time.,"Ok...I'm not really gonna write all that out. But don't waste your money. There is absolutely no orgainzation to this book, I have no idea, unless you memorized everything , how you would put this to use."
4,1000 most used spanish,"This gives me an opportunity to memorize the vocabulary words I will need the most. It is great, I can use it when studying a textbook would be difficult."
3,Useful Spanish words,I guess I should have ordered a spanish/english dictionary. dd ddd ddd dddd dddd dddd dddd dddd dddd ddd d
2,1001 most useful spanish eords,"The English translations are not exact , and because they are not , they cause confusion as to what is actually being stated as an example of word usage. The English translation needs to be word for word in order for this book to be useful."
1,You'd do better looking up words in a dictionary.,"A totally useless book with words selected haphazardly with only one explanation given, which hardly covers the different meanings of some words depending on the context. You could do better to yourself by opening a dictionary and selecting words in random. I got lured by its low price and wasted my money."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book on the advice of the reviewers. Perhaps I am too critical, but I think it is a waste of money. I prefer a more comprehensive reference.Major criticism. There is no English-Spanish x-ref."
1,Not useful,"This book is not good for beginners in spanish as it is intented to be, and is not, as well, suitable for intermediate or advanced. Now i understood why it sold for 0.01$."
5,Fantastic Book for the Price,"Folks, this book is $2 (less if you buy it used). Honestly, it would a great book for triple the price. I find it very useful for learning how to use the word in the context of a sentence, something that can be put into practice immediately. Staring at grammar rules and vocabulary lists doesn't work for me. I have to use the language for it to ""click."" If you learn like this, this is the book for you."
4,Just what I needed,"This book has helped me a lot, and it is very easy to carry around. The price was great, and it came in a few days. I have been using it ever since"
4,Bathtime for Caillou,"This is a fairly simple and original ""Caillou"" story. It's by Jaceline Sanschagrin in the style of the original Caillou books. In this story, Caillou goes out to play in the dirt. He has fun and finds a caterpillar. He wants to keep playing, but Mommy says he's getting dirty and needs a bath. He can continue playing in the tub.The text is illustrated on every page, the detail and color filling the page. A simple, but enjoyable story."
5,Great book on evidence based medicine/psychotherapy,"This book was not done justice by the previous review. This is a book about empirically validated treatments; it is not a novel. If your expectations are a capturing story line, please look elsewhere. If you are, however, interested in the rapidly growing field of evidence based medicine as it applies to psychiatry, than do indeed read this book. There is advice on how to search for material you may need for research, concise explainations of methods and theories of EBM, and too much to list here. This book is highly recommended for both laypersons, students, and professionals alike. Enjoy!"
3,DVD transfer messed up audio.,Same as my other review. Audio is barely audible in the first 3-5 seconds at the beginning of each episode.
5,love the guild,"need i say more, this series is hilarious.. they make fun of warcrafters amd gamers so bad, it is soo funny because unfortunately that is how my husband is :("
4,Guild Season1,"Overall quality is better than available on the web, but seems to have trouble in some players. Still love the Guild"
5,Great insights,Great insights into what it takes to become a millionaire using the same strategies that real world millionaires have been using.
3,Absurd,"Although I am very glad at the fact that WOTC is renewing this long-forgotten setting, I find it hard to believe that someone will become interested in a world centered on the actions of two people. If you want to buy this, I advise you to rather read the original books and come up with your own setting in likeness of this one."
4,Serious topic told in whimsical way just right for kids!,Kirk Werner's amazing artwork is the perfect compliment to Sherry Garr's entertaining (and relevant) story about the importance of recycling. I've read this story to my young sons a number of times and they are always enchanted by the wonderful pictures. They really enjoy picking out the various types of trash that Tia picks up with her gummy shoes on the way to school. A great kid's story with a strong message!
5,Deception Throughout Time,"This video is little over 90 minutes long and has high production value. This also includes snippets of Tom Hanks and Ron Howard weighing in on the saga between the Catholic Church and its enemies throughout history.This video is of the ""Facts behind the Movie"" genre. They take a fairly in depth look at the Catholic Church and secret society's such as The Illuminati, The Freemasons and The Hashashin.This video is very well done and a very interesting look at the facts that drive the Movie Angels and Demons. If you are fan of the Davinci Code, Angels and Demons and the History Channel then I believe you will like this video as well. 5 Stars.For more on me and my work:The Master Within"
3,A little boring,"Personally I enjoyed Wiggling Worms at Work (only about worms) much more than this book, and I'm a little surprised it is received so highly.It gave too many specifics that aren't important, like that scientists technically say that there are 100,000 types of soil, or something. What does that even mean? I thought things like this made it lose focus.One cool thing it talked about was how soil needs to have different types to be healthy, and if you pour water on clay, it just sits at the top. It also talked about how important topsoil is and how it can be blown away.It seemed more like a class than a fun book to learn just because learning is fun and dirt is magical.Overall, I didn't think it had a fluid feel to it as the book progressed. Maybe it's just me, but it didn't excite me like Wiggling Worms at Work did."
5,Parsons & Wolfe,"Excellent collection of Parsons/Wolfe tunes. I have their greatest hits, volumes 1 & 2 and the Definitive Collection. This is far more superior than those other albums. Would recommend this to all Alan Parsons fans."
5,Essential,"The album name says it all! Excellent stuff. If you are an Alan Parsons fan, this is a must-have!"
1,no good,This product is cheaply made and comes pre-seasoned with weird coating. Made in China. I will stick with Lodge.
5,Keilen Country Cabin Reversable Griddle,"Fantastic price, product and quality. Used daily with out any disappointments. Even heat distribution. Great sear marks for steaks and seafood. You can not go wrong with this product. Great price value."
4,Anatomy of Movement,"I am a Polarity student so this book was a a great addition to my library. The illustrations are fantastic, very detailed and clear. The book arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner."
4,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book for the study of kinesiology. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition. I'm very pleased the this purchase,"
5,Easy to understand and very helpful,"As a student of yoga and dance, I've been looking for an anatomy book to help me understand what's involved in movement. Unfortunately, most of the books I found were encyclopedic reference tomes that overwhelmed me with information. So I was delighted to run across this one: because its specific focus is movement, the drawings and descriptions cover only the relevant anatomical details. It's easy to understand and clear without being simplistic. The organization of the book makes it easy to find the information you want. And it doesn't just show joints and muscles; other relevant body parts are illustrated so the reader comprehends how everything works together (I never understood what the diaphragm really looks like until I saw this book!). This is a book that belongs in everyone's library -- it's not just for dancers or bodyworkers."
5,The finest introduction to muscle & joint biomechanics,"This excellent book focuses on the practical explanation of joint construction and function. Describes in easy-to-understand terms how muscles act upon joints. Uncanny in its ability to simplify a complex subject, if studied carefully it will give there reader an understanding of applied anatomy and kinesiology to almost second year university level. Excellent-yet-simple illustrations can be related to Dance, Gymnastics, Yoga and Martial Arts. I have used it extensively throughout my degree and in my opinion it should be a standard text in all human movement and physiotherapy courses."
5,wonderful book,"This book is everything I wanted. I faced facts a long time ago that when it comes to subjects like science and anatomy, I'm not incredibly gifted. But I understood everything in this book during the first read. It is all laid out so matter-of-factly, that it is easy to digest.As a yoga instructor, I have been looking for a book that covers how the human body moves in a way that I could apply towards my knowledge of postures. This book succeeded admirably."
4,"helpful, but needed more examples","I used book for my Yoga Teacher training course. Learning the larger muscles is easy, but the smaller more detailed, deeper muscles is diffucult. This book really illustrated these wonderfully!Loved the movement directional pictures, though sometimes I was still confused since I was doing a slightly different movement, such as rotating shoulders/blades back and down (used in most yoga poses), then also while upside down in a headstand, trying to get the muscles identified was difficult.Glancing through the book was overwhelming, but when I really sat down to examine a movement, it was great!"
4,"Simple, Easy language for students","This book gives lots of info in simple, easy to understand language. Very easy read. Could go a little more in depth in the gait cycle at the end of the book as this is very important to understand."
1,"Too complicated, did not learn from it at all",This book was recommended for my yoga teacher training. I had some anatomy in school but only basics. This books is very complicated to understand and I was personally not able to follow it neither learnt from it. The other students in my Teachers Training had similar experiences on this book.
4,"Well written, and complex material is presented in user friendly manner without compromising content :-).","This book is well written and complex material is presented in user friendly manner without compromising content :-). At first I was reluctant to spend the money, but I'm pleased with the book. Right now as I see it the book is worth it's price and more."
3,Could be better,"This book is recommended for many yoga teacher trainings and is what purchased it for. I've taken collage level anatomy courses in the past, so am not completely new to the concepts and terminology. The book is great at keeping things simple and limiting the information to what is needed for movement. It also has good drawings littered throughout the pages. However, it can be difficult to get used to the way it is written. At times the writing seems random and could use a little more detail to help you get a better understanding. Sometimes the phrasing doesn't really make sense and it will often only give one example. The easiest way I found to work with this book and really understand what was going on was to pair it with an anatomy coloring book. So it's good for giving you basic knowledge but you'll probably need something else if you really want to understand it."
4,Very Helpful,I find it really helpful to understand how our muscolar system works during yoga asanas
3,An Honest and Gritty Look at the Be Bop Era of Jazz!,"This Bio was written with an honest look at Roy Porter's Life as one of the many orginators of this truly American Art Form ""Be-Bop"". It is a must read! He was just as honest in person...His canor was quite refreshing, He's my daughter's grandpa...We will miss him dearly, He recently departed this place..To the Greatest Jam Session Ever in the Heavens! We'll miss you G'pa Roy!"
4,Creative look at depression....,"This book is amazing...not at all open ans shut, black and white, but, rather, an incredibley unique portrayal of a woman's journey through depression."
3,strange,"this work jumps around a lot, and might be difficult to chronologically follow. Bottom line, a great description of two years in the loony bin. A classic, female, 18, anywhere USA, story. Everyone who reads this book is bound to feel a little bit of what Kaysen felt during those tumultuous years. finally, someone wrote what everyone in that situation was thinking, but didn't have the courage to say out loud. Brava, Kaysen!!!"
4,Girl Interrupted,"The book, Girl Interrupted, by Susan Kaysen is a very well written book. The author, Susan Kaysen, does an amazing job of making it feel like you are right with her the through out her whole experience at the hospital. This non-fiction novel is a book regarding a teenage girl who got checked in to some sort of a mental hospital. It takes you through of all of her different experiences, personal thoughts, and introduces you to people she met along the way. Girl Interrupted gives you a real life experience and makes you feel like you are part of it, too. You learn about the world inside a mental hospital and even shows you all the paper work along the way. It makes you want to keep reading to find out more, and to see if she ever gets out. This book is great if you want to learn more about psychology, and how people act."
2,Not close to what I expected,"I had much anticipated reading this book and when I finally got to, I found it was basically boring and slow. It seemed to lack a true plot and it was just like mindless babbling about nothing."
1,see the movie and avoid the book,"i've never read a book that wasn't ruined by the movie version until girl interrupted. this book was awful. though i feel sympathy for the author considering the book is her life story, i was bewildered by the poor writing and lack of emotion. i was truly bored. for the first time, i'm suggesting others to see the movie and avoid the book. i never thought any movie version could be better than the book. but in this case it is."
4,A wonderful book though confusing at times,"I thought that this book was extremely well written, except for the fact that Kaysen goes back and forth that sometimes it throws you off a bit. However, I think that this is one of the greatest books I have ever read"
1,I didn't finish,"I tried reading this book three times and each time I disliked something else about it. So, now I have given up for sure."
1,Boring!,This book was a waste of time. It seemed the author tried to take a boring short story and add to it until it made a book. I'm sorry I bought it.
3,Mental with lack of true feeling,"I admit that I got this book because of the actresses that are in the movie based on it. I thought it was well written and all but there was a total lack of raw emotion. It wasn't like you were with her in an institution, it was like an all girls school. I think that if you had to go through all this you would have a definite feel for what the experience brought out in you. I also didn't like the lengthy mental descriptions, it was a bit boring."
4,Maybe we all walk the edge of sanity?,"This book is a wonderful example of how close we all teeter between the land of sanity and insanity. Many of the feelings she expressed felt real to me, authentic. Many days I struggle to get out of bed because of depression and I know that if I choose, I can stay in bed, ignoring the world around me and disappear from life forever, or I can get up and struggle to make it through another day. Susanna was too happy to give up the control of living her own life. She makes the conscious effort to climb from the depths of her own destruction. I just rented the movie and enjoyed it so much that I am going to start re-reading the book tonight!"
3,"Girl, Reading","It wasnt the most readable book in the world, but being someone who loves to read on the subject of mental illness, I enjoyed it well enough. It seems rather disjointed, but I guess that's the way it's meant to be. It doesnt give a lot away, for example, it doesnt say a thing about what may have caused Susanna to become so confused and upset in the first place. It doesnt explain whether or not she continues to live her life this way, or if suddenly, by magic, she is cured? It seems as though the writer doesnt actually remember a whole lot about what actually happened, and tends to write more about the other patients than about herself. Despite all of this, I enjoyed the subject matter and it was a short, sweet read. I think Id need to read more true accounts of mental illness before i can make an accurate decision on what I think of this book."
4,"Review of Girl, Interrupted","Girl, Interrupted is an autobiography about a teenage author in the 60's who was admitted into a mental hospital for a borderline personality disorder. We found this book to be an interesting story of the psychology of the mind. We felt that this book was well-written, serious, and, at times, ironically funny. As teenagers, we found that the author's mind was revealed in a dark labirynth of a teenage mind. We recommend this book to anyone from teenage girl-age to adults, or to anyone who is interested in the challenge of the woman's mind. One thing to keep in mind is that the book is written out of order, which makes it a bit confusing, until you realize that that is part of her disease. This gives the book a unique flair and an interesting view of her disorder. We highly recommend it."
4,A diary-like depiction of life in a mental hospital.,"An enjoyable, stream of consciousness read from beginning to end. The book, although different from the movie, was in many ways more enjoyable. It was a less glamorous account of this piece of the author's life."
4,A peek into a world that I have thought about often,"I have often wondered wether I was insane and this book showed me that we all are a little, some of us control it a little better at different times is all."
2,Wake Me UP!,"I listened to the book on tape. First of all the monotone author had no business narrating this one. The book was ok and I could find many more worthwhile books to listen to instead. Now on the otherhand, if you have insomnia this is the perfect remedy. zzzzzzzzzzzzz"
2,Definitely a borderline,"Borderlines are manipulative, and in this respect Kaysen appears to continue to suffer from her diagnosis. She tried to make me think she was trapped in hostile, prison-like environment when actually she was self-admitted and could have, being over 18, signed herself out any time. I got the feeling she needed to be crazy, to have the context and structure the whole experience allowed. College wasn't her thing, so she dabbled in being crazy for a couple of years. She only left to get when another instituion, marriage, was offered as an option after all. If I'm wrong and Kaysen was debilitated by severe illness, then kaysen really downplayed her illness and symptoms as dramatically as she thrills us with the ""loony bin"" details in this book. Sneaky. Very borderline. (I worked on a psyche ward for over three years, BTW.)"
3,Better than the film,"I was very interested in the book and film after finding out it was written by a women diagnosed with BPD, which I have. However, it doesn't talk much about her mental condition, it's more about the mental hospital and the other girls that are there. It almost reads like a book of anecdotes, with pieces of her medical records interspersed. It skips around quite a bit in time. I saw the movie first, and was not very impressed with it. I sat down and read the book all in one sitting, and found it an easy read and very engrossing, although definitely not the best book if you are wanting to learn about BPD."
2,"Girl, Intolerable","Read it. Not because it offers a plethora of keen insights, or sharp witticisms; such things are sparsely found in this book. Read it to obtain a trite and somewhat conceited account of what had the potential to be an intriguing psychological study. Read it to learn how not to write. Read it to read an account that tries in vain to analyze the depths and nuances of the human psyche. Read it expecting noble intent, tempered by disappointing content. Read it, not for the paltry redeeming qualities to be found in it, but for cognizance of the qualities not found in it - qualities that make books good."
2,A book about being in a mental hospital shouldn't be boring,"Another book that poses as non-fiction, but seems questionable in the author's ability to remember the events given. It reminds me far too much of the anti-drug propaganda ""Go Ask Alice,"" but with only a few interesting moments. I have to admit, I was pretty indifferent when reading it-- never a good sign."
2,I tried to like this book but...,"Ms. Kaysen is annoying! I kept trying to like this memoir and empathize with Ms.Kaysen, but I found her to be self-involved and kind of irritating. Sorry. If you want to read an excellent memoir, try Lori Schiller's ""The Quiet Room""."
3,Good book but I wanted more,"this book is a terrific explanation of what happens inside a mental institution in the late 60's and it is thoughtful of its treatment of what is the definition of insanity. However, I wish the author had revealed a little more about her personal life e.g. why did she try to kill herself and what was her homelife like? If you are going to tell your own story I think you owe the reader all the facts that are necessary to get your point across. Otherwise, it was an enjoyable book."
4,"Very honest, brutally at times","As a 17 year old who is bipolar type 2 and has been in a psych ward, this book was very real to me. Painfully so at times. I think that everything in life is relative and sanity is no exception to the rule.One thing I did wish was that the author told more about how she was managing these days.All in all, it was an excellent book. I would reccomend it to anyone who is bipolar or is striving to gain empathy for those who are."
4,the movie caught my heart a little more,"I found the book to be very well written with concrete detail. It was very straight-forward without any symbolism, metaphors, etc. To me, the plainspoken style failed to leave any open space for the reader to imagine and create his/her own themes and interpretations. Don't get me wrong, the story line is quite intense and very serious, but at least to me, the movie had that slant to it that didn't just give you the facts; it left you guessing and interpreting on your own. It could be because I fell in love with the movie before I read the book. Girl, Interrupted is very honest and thought provoking, causing the reader to look inside themselves as well as the common nature of humans. The characters are round, colorful, and vividly blunt, giving the story its open and upright themes of sanity, human nature, insecurities and fears, as well as the longer journies we all mistakably take in life."
2,Disjointed and Disappointing,"I would first like to say that I have not seen the movie that was based on this book, and I am not judging it in relation to the movie. Girl, Interrupted is a memoir of a young woman who was committed to a mental institution after just one session with a psychologist. What I did not understand was why, after only one session, she allowed this stranger to shove her into a taxi and commit herself to an institution. It started off well, involving different people who were in the institution and things they did, but further into the book Kaysen started trying to be a psychologist herself. I did not want a psychology lesson, I wanted more information about what went on in the institution itself. She was in there for quite a while, and yet there isn't much about her life in the hospital. I can see how the movie would be a lot better since the viewers would be spared a tedious psychology lesson."
4,Mental Disturbance or Just Normal Teenage Years,"I know I really like a book when I find myself always thinking about it. I was drawn to Girl Interrupted and whatever room I left it in.From her unique perspective, Susanna Kaysen raises the question; how does society identify the insane. Are those who choose to live outside of accepted behavioral norms insane or do they become more vulnerable because of the resulting social isolation?If you, or someone you know suffers from a mental illness I highly recommend this book as an insight. 25 years after Susanna had been discharged, she researched her 'diagnosis' from the DSM III. Being told she suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder she began to wonder how many other so called disorders have been removed from this new edition and will her disorder still exist 25 years later? At one time, homosexuality was listed in the DSM as a psychiatriac disorder. You won't find it in there now. Makes you wonder what will be taken out next."
3,An Excellent Depiction of Madness,"I had first seen the movie and had gained intrest in reading the memoir after reading The Bell Jar. While The Bell Jar was excellent, this left me not satisfied enough.The book to me is a quick read (it's under 200 pgs.) and I sped through it rather quickly. While I will admit that this is one of the best descriptions of a former mental insitution pacient, Kaysen created incredible short chapters and it's too scattered (the film adaption puts all the events in cronological order).Also, I also didn't like how Kaysen blabs in the last two chapters. To me, the conclusion felt too much like ""filler"" words it was like taking in too much of a good thing. It is best of she just kept it a chapter short, I would've been able to handle it better."
4,disturbing,Well written story that has some really disturbing moments like the mindset of someone right when they're about to commit suicide. Definitely a page-turner!
2,"Girl, with no point","Girl, Interrupted is an adequate memoir full of short stories about Susanna Kaysen's, the author, stay at a mental hospital after being diagnosed with a borderline personality. The reader should not expect much else from the novel than these short stories and a long drawn out analysis of her so-called character disorder. Girl, Interrupted is a quick, semi-entertaining read that includes humor, sadness, and a little bit of adventure, without much closure. I enjoyed the first half of the book, but I felt that at the halfway point the author lost her point in writing this novel. I did find some humor within some of the stories, and in 18 year old Kaysen's contempt for people in general. Overall this psychological memoir was good, but I prefer novels wth a plot, and that follow the plot sequence."
3,Poignant?,"Girl, Interrupted is a pretty basic book. The author did not delve too deeply into her own depression or accompanying emotions. The writing seemed very basic, and it did not force me to think. I think that the author left a lot of things out-too many things out. I loved the movie, though."
3,Little disappointed.,"I did like the book and her account of what she went through. I never thought I would EVER say this in my life; but, the movie was better. I expected the book to be bigger than it was. Being a Psychology Major, it was interesting to read about one of the mental institutions back in the ""60's"""
2,Disjointed at best,"I made the mistake of watching the movie first, and I have to say, though the movie took extreme liberties with the book, the movie was better. I felt the book was dry and sparse, and at the end of the book, I really didn't care anymore about Susanna then I did in the beginning. Susanna is not a very sympathetic character in the book"
4,"A Life, Interrupted","Girl, Interrupted is the story of Susanna Kaysen, who voluntarily checked herself into MacLean Hospital for a two year stay in 1967.Susanna describes hospital life, her fellow inmates, the nurses, the doctors, and the staff with unemotional clarity. The reader is given an inside look at life in a mental institution as Susanna is checked in, diagnosed, and undergoes treatment for her ""borderline personality"" diagnosis.It was a very interesting read, but an unemotional one. Ms. Kaysen writes about herself, and everyone else, with startling objectivity. It almost reads as a case study, but a very interesting one. The people in this memoir are very real."
4,a glance at the way things are,"I didn't really think that this book would be a good read. I figured that it would be like many other books about borderline personality disorder--factual, plain, and very uninteresting. However, once I started reading, I seriously couldn't put it down! I loved the way Kaysen described everything, it gives you a glance at the way some people live and think, and at the way they feel. It was definitely worth the read. I recommend this to anyone and everyone."
3,"Alright, but didn't meet my expectations","Girl, Interrupted was a very clear book and an easy & fast read. I loved reading the medical charts throughout the book; it was interesting and something different to break up the text. I expected a lot more from it though. The chapters all seemed to be disconnected from each other which made the whole story seem disconnected too. It was more like several little memoirs combined to make a book. All in all, it was worth reading, but it didn't live up to all the praise I'd heard of it."
2,not so much,"i revisited this book four times, and each time something was missing. it was like the author was looking inward on her experiences, but without feeling or true reflection, as if to prove something. its in a spliced journal like version, that, while promising, falls short of its intent. i wont go into the details, because most of you know of the plot. it's a dated version of mental illness, that does not have the flexibility and easily transferred structure/themes that its counterparts contain (prozac nation, the bell jar, etc)..."
5,"Girl, Interrupted: The screenplay","This book gives life to the movie as the reader is allowed to view the script, much in the same way the actors did as they put life to this story. It is fascinating to read the screenplay and compare it to the actual film, noting the instances where the actors improvised and personalized their charactors lines. Most notable is the charactor of Lisa, only Angelina Jolie could possibly get away with portraying such a disturbing charactor in such an alluring and heroic light. If you enjoyed the movie Girl, Interrupted you must read this screenplay, as it will leave you feeling enlightened with a new found awareness."
4,un-interrupted,"When I first read this book, a few years back, I was amazed at how engrossing Susanna Kaysen's story was. Unable to put it down, I read it everywhere I went; in bed, at the park, while eating and even at work. Never have I read a novel, and a memoir at that, where I have truly felt I was part of the action and yet an onlooker like everyone else in the institution. I've recommended this book to everyone I know and have even boughten it as X-mas presents for a few. This is a novel that should be read by anyone who has been through a situation where they felt they don't belong or they weren't 'good enough'. And I think that's pretty much most of us..."
1,"A Story Written Before, (and better!)","This is quite possibly one of the worst books I have read in a long time. Unfortunately, this story has been brilliantly written before by so many more authors; ( The Bell Jar, by Sylvia palth, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, etc.) I am not unsympathetic to her story, I am just very disappointed with her interpretation and her sperficial accounting. The ""highlights"" of her experiences are events that have been portrayed by many other authors and novels leaving the storyline falling flat and repetitive. The movie surely must have had to be re-invented for there is truly nothing there in the book. I have never before taken a book back, and this is the first one I ever considered doing so. If this subject interests you, as it did I, consider reading the other books mentioned for a vastly more rewarding experience. I am, however, giving Ms. Kaysen another chance with Far Afield. Hopefully it will prove to be more satisfying."
1,VERY DATED MATERIAL,"As someone actively in treatment with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and who spent two years as an inpatient during the late1980's at Mclean Hospital, I found Kayson's book to be verging on dangerous. Her experience is dated enough to no longer be accurate, and while it is written as a personal memoir, clearly from the comments here, people are being given a (perhaps unintentional) false exposé on the hospital, and more importantly on the diagnosis. Recently there has been a lot of advancement in reasearch in the field, and treatments have become more hopeful."
1,boring and overrated,"I don't knwo what all the fuss is about this book. I read it as an assignment and forced myself to finish it despite the overwhelming dullness present in this book. Funny parts? One. Cruelty the author is subject to? being forced to take pills. Maybe this book would be more interesting to a psychology student or such, but to an average reader it's a 160 page essay on mental illness. Boring, overinflated and melodramatic was how this book came through to me."
3,For once : movie s MUCH better,Usually books are much better than the movie . In this case its the other way round . The book while interesting- is flat . The movie actually has much more going for it .
1,From a teens point of view...,"I know that a teen's point of view based on a book is rarely accountable for, but I have to say that this was one of the most uninteresting books I have read. There was no plot to it at all; it was just scattered about. I learned absolutely nothing about the characters. Maybe if some background information or any information at all about each character was established I would've enjoyed it more and would even consider giving this book two stars out of five.This is actually the first time that a movie was better than the actual book from which it was based on.It's not worth the money or the time."
2,Not memorable,"I've read many books that have a similar style to this one and this was the worst. I don't even remember half the book, that's how uninteresting I felt it to be. If you're looking for memoirs of mental patients and things of that sort, read ""The Bell Jar"" (Sylvia Plath) or ""Prozac Nation"" (Elizabeth Wurtzel)."
5,"Calling all ""crazy"" youths","This is the greatest book written on mental health and mental hospitals. If you've been in a hospital you will totaly relate.Susanna Keysen puts every aspect of hospital life and ""menatal Illness"" into this book. Any one who is looking to reminise and find out what happens after the hospital READ THIS BOOK!"
4,The Interruption,"I enjoyed the book even if I'm not all that sure about the message.This book was the true story of Susanna Kaysen who was committed to a mental hospital when she was 18. The chapters were short and crisp, and could most likely be read as short stories in themselves. The book was also interspersed with official forms documenting Kaysen's two year stay at McLean, which Kaysen only got the rights to many years after with the help of a lawyer. Kaysen kept her writing humorous and curt as she talked about the various patients, doctors, and incidents at the hospital. I liked these chapters, but got bored later on in the book after she left the hospital and began to describe the bounds of her illness. I'm a teenager myself, and my attention span is short.I enjoyed the book for its quirkiness and memorable characters, where others might like it for its comments on mental illness and the treatment of the mentally ill in the 60's."
2,"Short, undetailed, but a nice look into her world","This is a very short book, which is actually great, because if you're on the fence about getting involved with it, by the time you've made up your mind you'll have already finished it.I read the book because I watched the movie and I was curious. The book fulfilled my curiosity but not much else. It adds snip-its of details to the characters and definitely has a more viable believability than the movie did but if you've watched the movie you already know all the dialogue. Nothing in the book was spared when they made the movie it seemed.I enjoyed the book. It was short and I wish it was longer and more detailed. I def recommend to borrow it from the library though instead of buying it. My two cents."
5,The best book I have read in a long time,"Girl, Interrupted is by far one of the best books I have ever read. It is seldom that you get someones perspective of an institution from the inside. Though there were a few boring parts, the book was overall very well written. Another book I reccomend on the same subject is Stop Pretending: What Happened When My Big Sister Went Crazy."
2,Story interrupted!,"I was very dissapointed with the lack of depth.The subject material was fascinating knowing that it really did occur, but it could have been a much more interesting read. I was left with a desire to know more about what happened to each character."
3,"Film version loses touch with reality of Girl, Interrupted","Although film scripts are always fun to read and compare to what actually got into the movie, please take this adaptation of the masterpiece Girl, Interrupted at face value (or less). The book far surpasses the movie... you lose so many scenes that bring out the true essence of each person, who are not ""characters,"" but real people! In the film, they are reduced to characters. By the way, the ending in the film (Angelina backing Winona up with a knife in the basement) is completely false and the book ending is much better. True, the movie has its priceless moments -- my favorite scene is in the ice cream parlor -- but please just read the book. It is divided up into sections, some that are just 2 or 3 pages long, and it's such easy reading."
2,Movie much better than book,"This is the rare case when the movie is far superior to the book. The book is very introspective and mostly medical, as the author examines her diagnosis and reflects on it. The characters she meets in the mental institution are touched on briefly. I applaud the screenwriters for taking those few mentions and expanding them and really making an interesting story out of it...which is the movie. Their different spin on Lisa, Daisy, the tunnels, the suicide, the psychology behind Daisy, were all very imaginative. On the other hand, the book does a better job of explaining the title and tying it into the Vermeer painting, which isn't even mentioned in the movie."
3,"Girl, Interrupted nothing like movie",I was a little disapointed to find out that the book was really nothing like the movie. Which goes to show that you should read the book before going to the movie. I kept thinking about the characters in the movie and trying to compare them in the book but once again the movie had great amounts of hollywood drama. The book was ok a bit confusing at times but otherwise it was an OK book I finished it in one day in that shows anything? Maybe I didnt like it so much because I was expecting different things.
3,Shows how much has changed...,"First of all, it's not like the movie. Is it better or worse, I'm not sure. I don't like how the movie took such creative liberty with the story and it's characters but I also don't like the way the book jumps around so often. Though some might say the chaotic way the memories are written reflect the author and main character's own unconventional thinking.The book shows us how people with ""mental problems"" were all lumped together and for the most part not treated but locked up and subdued. Were these people totally emotionally fit? Well, no, but being locked away was not everyone's answer.I'd like to see a book of the same subject matter about the 1990's and how treatment almost seems the opposite. Doctors seem happier to keep upping the Prozac dosage rather than lock them up for awhile. It is interesting to see how people's conceptions can change."
4,"Insightful, fascinating thoughts on near madness","Susanna Kaysen in Girl, Interupted provides several fascinating and thought-provoking ideas and thoughts on the anatomy of near-madness, in a the form of this slightly jumpy book. The skips from time to time and subject to subject between chapters in a slightly unorthodox way of telling a chronological tale can be a teensy bit difficult, but are well worth it for the insight and general good read provided. At times funny, at others serious, Girl, Interupted shouldn't be missed, if only for the candid and refreshing takes on diagnosed insanity it provides."
3,I liked the movie better,"I watched the movie before I read the book, so maybe after watching the movie and seeing everything close up in visual detail, I was disappointed by the book's lack of detail. Sure it had it's moments and cute tales especially about Daisy and her chickens, Lisa and her escapades, and the whole group going to the ice cream palor, but what it didn't have was the complete package that the movie presented to the viewer. Instead of reading the emotional turmoil of the girls in the minimum security ward, you actually witnessed it, and I found that much more compelling. However, I really enjoyed the chapter ""Mind vs. Brain"", in which the author describes in humorous detail the difference between a sane and an insane person. Watch the movie, and skip the book."
2,Very Boring,"I found this book to be a very boring read. I had watched the dramatized ""Girl Interrupted"" in the movies so I borrowed this book from the library. Susanna tells us NOTHING in this book."
2,Read the Bell Jar Instead,"Sylvia Plath was admitted to McLean Hospital in 1953, fifteen years before Susanna Kaysen's two year stay there, and The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath was published in 1963, twenty-nine years before the publication of Girl Interrupted. Both books are about young women on the verge of both adulthood and madness. However, Plath's novel is told with depth and substance, whereas Kaysen just skims the surface.While Girl Interrupted paints a vivid portrait of Kaysen's stay at McLean hospital, it doesn't do much else. It's a quick and easy read, despite it not being told in order. It muses on and on about having a mental illness, and while at times the text is engaging, it's never enlightening or beautiful."
4,A poetic rendering of a bygone era of psychiatric therapy,"Susanna Kaysen dealt with mental and psychic pain in a fairly common way: an attempted suicide. The year was 1967, the infancy of psychotropic drugs, when psychotherapy was in its hey-day. Girl Interrupted is Kaysen's memoir of two years spent in an expensive and exclusive psychiatric unit, previous guests having been Sylvia Plath, James Taylor, and Ray Charles, among others.The wit, wisdom, wackiness, and lyricism of 'a madhouse' come through clearly in the author's writing, and she offers vivid and insightful accounts of daily life, her fellow 'guests,' and the link between art and madness which often manifests itself in manic depression, or as we have lately been taught to say, Bipolar Disorder.A good read, and a pretty good movie..."
2,Not my choice of pleasure reading,"While I found her stories to be interesting enough, the book is not in a chronological order which made it a little hard for me to follow the stories of each individual girl that was talked about. I read this book for my sociology class and would not have read it if not for the class. The hardest thing I found was that early on in one part she talked about a girl that was in the hospital for trying to commit suicide and eventually succeeded, yet later on the dead girl is in one of the other stories. I had to take notes to keep track of everybody and their ilness and treatments and personalities."
2,"Anemic, totally overrated","If this book was any longer, I would have had to put it down, I finished it in one day. It started out well, I was excited to hear what happens. Parts of it were really well written, then it just trailed off. You have no idea anything about her parents or her marriage which she summed up in a few sentences. It had a lot of potential, but it didn't really build up.This book came across as a little too 'teen angst' to me, making it fashionable to be depressed. She sounds like she has a disorder, but thrives on it, almost like she's proud of it. Totally self indulgent. Don't waste your time."
3,GIRL ... TRYING TO FINISH A BOOK,"I DON'T LIKE THE WAY IT'S PRESENTED : JUMPING FROM A LITTLE STORY TO ANOTHER ONE ; I PREFER WHEN THERE IS A CONTINUATION IN A BOOK & MAYBE THIS WHY I HAVE DIFFICULTIES FINISHING THE BOOK... HOWEVER IT'S A GOOD ""REPORT"" ON HOW SOME DOCTORS & HOSPITALS ARE ABUSING THEIR POWER ! ESPECIALLY IN THIS AREA ! THERE IS AN HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS IN MY FAMILY AND BELIEVE ME DOCTORS WHO SEE A PATIENT FOR 5 MINUTES AND DECIDE THAT HE OR SHE IS NOT ""NORMAL"" DO EXIST ! SO FOR THIS AND OTHER THINGS I'LL MAKE AN EFFORT TO FINISH THE BOOK ..."
1,Dull Read,"This book was such a disappointmen! It's the book about nothing. Girl, Interrupted was very dull and there was no character development, I never felt anything for the main character or anyone else in the book. Some sections did not even make sense."
3,Girl Interrupted,"The kind of world the autor lives in is quite small. Limited firstly by her sex to opine everything, and then by the nature of her attempts at control, the author can only guess at what would pass for writing. Then again, if it exposes the myriad personal problems of the younger generation of immediate self gratifying, blame everyone, generation of women, (which fortunately is going out of style) it is genius."
2,Not bad for someone who wants to learn how to commit suicide,It got kind of boring after a while. The beginning was interesting
5,Simply Amazing,"I read this book 3 times within the last 2 years. It takes you into a new world. You can invision the place in which she stays. The descriptions are wonderfull. You become caught up within this world of ""sane"" and ""insane"". Deffinetly a must read, if you are into psychological books go for it."
5,This book is insane! But good!,"This book is crazy and also good in that sense. It got a little depressing from time to time. The thing I most liked about this book is it's synoposis, ""You can either go on with life, or give up."" Ans Susanna Kaysen did not give up, she was brilliant with writing as phsycological manifolds kicked in her curiousity of being crazy! That's why I think we should see her as a Girl Interrupted by madness, and that's why we should give this book credit!"
5,"""Nothing but skin...""","The writing style of the author is very special; it feels strange at first, but after a few pages you get used to it. I liked the style. It was surreal and portrayed the chaotic emotional world of young Susanna perfectly. My favorite charakter from the book was, of course, Lisa. She was so intensive and I simply loved her. My favorite part of the book was when Lisa wrapped toilet paper all around the furniture in the living room. That was so funny, but touching. You won't know what I mean if you haven't read it. Only the ending was disappointing, I think. It was too sudden and very hard to understand. But after all, read it! It's the money worth, and you will wonder if you're crazy yourself after reading it..."
3,"Yep, she's crazy all right.","Read it to as an initiation to an all men's book club. Found some part very interesting, like analysis based on the type of car you drive. Explains a lot about some folks I know."
3,Definitely Different from the Movie,"I guess my problem with this book is that I saw the movie first and decided to read it after I saw an interview with Winnona Ryder. While the movie is a continuous story that makes sense, this book is just bits and pieces of Susanna Kaysen's 2-year stay in the mental hospital. I'm sure I would have liked the story better if I had not seen the movie first and had pre-conceived notions in my head regarding what the book would contain and what it wouldn't. That said, it is still a good story and it makes you laugh in some parts and feel terrible for these girls in other parts. It is definitely worth reading."
3,Not bad,"This book was well written and kept your interest throughout. However, it has been compared to the Bell Jar, which is unfair. This Bell Jar is more about a descent into madness, which this book deals with far less, and is the poorer for it. However, one of the central themes of this book is whether or not the author was in fact as ill as the authorities claim, so perhaps she had to concentrate on the ward and its inhabitants. The characters were depicted well and so were the relationships with various doctors and psychiatrists. This book is worth reading, but read the Bell Jar first."
3,Girl Interrupted,"In the book Girl Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen a young girl at the age of eighteen is put into a mental institution. It is actually a confessional book about herself. She is sent there because of a former suicide attempt. The doctors had diagnosed her with a character disorder. Susanna is deeply depressed and feels hopeless. She was only supposed to stay at McLean hospital for a few weeks, but those weeks turned into two long years. While she was there she met many different and intresting types of people. Pretty much all she ever did was go to therapy, watch TV, and sit around and talk with her friends. There are twists and turns and many unexpected things happen throughout the book. I recommend this novel because it is suprisingly funny and it is quite astonishing."
2,Seemed a bit rambling,Seemed like the book was rambling. Didn't really see the point. Was interresting for someone who didn't already know what it was like inside of an 'insane' assylm. Would have like more info on what really went on though.
4,True Story,"I got this book as a Christmas gift from my American friend in 2000. I wished for this book, because I couldn't get in anywhere from Finland. I saw the movie before I read this book, and I just loved the movie so much.This book describes the life in the 60's so well, that if you took a little too much something and flushed it with some alcohol you were crazy. Susanna wasn't crazy, she just didn't know what she wanted. Partly for the reason why she ended up in the hospital, can be used her parents. She learned a lot about life in the hospital, she made everyone else little better there, she was kinda like a teacher to the rest of the people in the hospital and the others taught her. Like in the end of the book, most of them were out in the 70's, most of them were fine, most of them she met, some of them ever again."
4,pretty cool,"Susanna Kaysen at age 18 was sent to a mental hospital to 'rest' and stayed there for almost 2 years. In short chapters she describes other patients, doctors and strange oddities of living in a mental institution (Like ice cream trips). One of the more interesting facts of this particular institution are the famous patients who stayed there before her. This is a very quick read.. couple of hours is all you need. The movie is also very good and very much like the book."
2,Overrated -- Read One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Instead,"I picked up this book at the airport, hoping to read something that would pass time and keep me interested during my journey. The book was short on length as well as other things -- like depth. I felt like the book had a lot to work with at the beginning -- a woman committed to an institution because of a man's idea of gender roles, crazy characters, weird doctors/nurses. Unfortunately, the author never goes really far with her topic and leaves a lot to be desired with the book. Overrated -- Read One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Instead Only read it if you like these coming of age, depressed teenage girl books."
3,A quaint memoir -- great airplane reading,"Susanna Kaysen's memoir of her stay in a mental institution is well written. I like the way she moves from chapter to chapter, not in a chronological way, but in a topical one. Each chapter discusses a different character or aspect of the experience, and the details are captured in a startling, real way. I wish it had been longer and more of the gaps had been filled in, but it was a satisfying read. I finished it on a two-hour flight."
2,A Dull read,"This memoir, I must admit is quite a boring read. I watched the movie first, which some say is a travesty, but honestly, I believe if I had read the book first, I would not have wanted to watch the movie. The book is dull and lifeless and jumps around too much.Although, this is a mimick of the illness she faced during her stay, it can be annoying to the reader. There is no indication of how close she was to any of the girls she befriended during her stay, although at the end you witness some closeness between Susanna and one of the girls that managed to get out, there is not a powerful pull here.This is not a very englightening read. I suggest you skip reading this book and read something like Prozac Nation instead. Or, just watch the movie for this book, it's definitely better even if the events are not true."
4,Short memoir on major depression.,"There were several things I liked about this book. It had short chapters, so the story flowed. It was a lot different than the movie (and I think better). It exposes the lengths Hollywood goes to in ""adapting"" a story for film. I enjoyed reading this book. It was a quick read (maybe two or three sittings). Kaysen is real with her thoughts and shocking when telling about the other patients in the ward. I like the addition of copies of some pages from her case file! They were so sparsely worded but enough to commit her. It makes me think about the state of the mental health system in the 1960's! It seemed all too easy for her to be ""locked away."" You can really see her brilliant mind at work in this book. I definitely recommend it for people interested in studying mental illness."
2,What's the big deal?,I bought this book because I thought it would provide some insight into the world of mental illness. I was sorely disappointed.
5,"An Honest, Brilliant Book","The Book ""Girl, Interrupted"" was many things. Sad, triumphant, and overall, inspiring to some of the people's reviews I've read. I had this book in my grasp for only two days before I could let go. It is exiting to read, and it really makes you think, of the consequences, and dangers, life offers you. This was a fantastic book. (Ages 12 and above)"
3,Very good movie,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. However, I can't help but notice that is basically a re-hash of ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"". Seriously. Still, it is a good movie in its own right, and its resemblance to ""Cuckoo's Nest"" can partially be chalked up to its source material."
1,You need to spend another $65 after you get the disk!!!,"In the first two minutes of the first tutorial the instructor tells you that you need to spend another $[...] to purchase a third party plug-in which the entire DVD will be based on. He then says if you don't have to plug-in you will not be able to follow along with any of the 3+hours of lessons you just bought... That's when I shut down the player and ejected the disk... What's the point? Seriously, Gnomon is suppose to be the best, but this is crap... Do they get commission from the plug-in maker?"
1,Misrepresented!!,VERY disappointed to receive the older version of this book when I purchased the current published version as pictured on the order page. The book I received was published in the 90's and has a different format inside and different cover. SO BUMMED!! Please provide accurate details when selling items to be far to consumers!!
3,Too Predictable Shocking Twist,"Once you know that there's a shocking twist to the ending - and I don't think you need spoilers; the book jacket gives that much away - in what is basically a three-character book, it doesn't take much to figure out who the corpse is in the beginning and who the likely killer. The conspicuous absense of the victim's sex being mentioned in Chapter 1 will tell you where the misdirection is going. I admit to not catching on when the point of view switched a few times, but felt it was more cheating than actual cleverness when it was revealed, and also disappointing. In a murder mystery, one wants to have someone to care about, and the one possible sympathetic character turns out to be as vile as the others. The heroine's remarkable self-obsession and self-romanticizing are entertaining, but she's really quite loathesome and in the end, no more plausible than the other figures. It's a quick read, but you need a bit of a mental cleansing afterward."
1,one sided,"i personally grew up in a non chabad household and learned in a chabad day school growing up.doing my own research of the subject i came to see that if you talk to someone in chabad regarding the moshiach issue these sources are known and do not refute the idea of the rebbe being moshiach. and there are many sources that point to the fact that the rebbe can and still is our awaited moshiach.this book (if already read)should be taken in its proper light, someones confused questions regarding a subject, who never asked(or cared to ask)the professer in that exact field for the answers. its like learning a gmara and refuting shulchan aruch from it.ask .seek. discover.what chabad ,and the rebe says about the subject,this book is a one sided look at moshiach!"
5,Great buy,"This is an excellent buy. You can't beat this for the price it's sold at. I got two of these and they arrived promptly, undamaged, and already assembled! I seriously hate assembling stuff even if its minor. So, naturally, anything that gets delivered already put together is a winner in my book. I took them out of the box, and put them to use. They block visibility effectively, yet allow some light to pass through without seeing what's behing them. If I could give more stars, I would. Don't think twice about it, just get them. You won't be disappointed. At least i wasn't."
2,Don't bother....,"A disappointing rock-n-roll- speed kills- quick thrills about Rock using the same format as Hollywood Babylon. Apart from a couple of shocking revelations ( to be found elsewhere if you are really that interested ) about Chuck Berry I found it the usual re-churned prose about Hendrix, Moon, Joplin - who deserve better... The photo of Sid Vicious used is a still from the awful film 'Sid and Nancy' and is actually Gary Oldman!"
3,A well-written book on rock sleaze and tragedy,"This is a very well-written book on the sleazy and tragic stories in rock & roll history, but many of the stories told in this book reveal nothing new to those knowledgeable of rock history.There are obligatory chapters on Jimi Hendrix, Keith Moon, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Sid Vicious, John Bonham, and Kurt Cobain. Some of the stories are better-written than others.The author should be commended for including stories slightly off the beaten path by not focusing only on the super-famous. There are chapters on people like Gram Parsons and Johnny Thunders, who would've easily been omitted from other books of the same nature.Each chapter in ""Rock Bottom"" is a quick read with straightforward writing, and everything appears well-researched. Descriptions of the author's personal encounters with some of the subjects add an appealing, unique touch.This is a must-read for anyone who believes in the myth that rock & roll excess is very glamorous."
4,Pamela is tops!,"I really enjoyed this well written book. Even though I'm not a fan of half the rockers Pamela wrote about, the book drew me in. The chapter on Chuck Berry was the best. This is definitely the sort of stuff Chuck left out in his own autobiography! The stuff on Gram Parsons brought tears to my eyes. I'm looking forward to any future books by Miss Des Barres, but for now I'll have to be content reading her column for E! entertainment online."
2,ho hum,"you know the way pamela writes is so bragadocious and condescending, it really turned me off.. i had wanted to read her other books, but after not even finishing this book, i will not be reading any more of her books"
1,Unsatisfying book,"I just borrowed this book and the prequel from the library. I have loved Frederik Pohl's books in the past and thought that this sounded good. The prequel was a great read, bringing forward some very interesting ideas and creating a believable if somewhat depressing view of the future. This book on the other hand, was what can best be described as filler. Nothing really happens in this book and it is much more a political potboiler than a science fiction book. It's sole purpose seems to be to show how petty and greedy people as a whole can be and to set up the next book.It is fine to put in some political intrigue and background information into a book, in fact it made the first book in the series very satisfying. But there still has to be some new ideas or at least some action mixed in or the reader feels cheated. All I can say is that if I had actually paid for this book I would definitely have felt cheated."
4,The Siege of Eternity,"This was a cleverly written narrative by one of my favorite science fiction writers. Pohl as usual manages to make the fantastic seem believable enough so that you can say to yourself, ""Something like this might be reality some day."""
2,Disappointing and Uninvolving,"Pohl has managed to write a novel in which I could not care about a single character. His plot moves along with the finest leaders of earth performing some of the stupidest action. Oh let's see, here is an alien who can erase memories, implant machinery in your body without your knowing, a representative a race who is so far beyond our science that we can't begin to understand their abilities. Let's try to grab the personal property of these creatures and then insult and treat them badly. Does this seem likely to you? Not to me. And the ending was sudden and left me with one regret, that I had spent my time reading this book."
3,comic bookish,"The Other end of Time (the first in the series) was certainly better in terms of story and imagination. This is simply a bridge to a third novel, which I'm hoping is a bit better. But here's the thing, at least for me: this is basically a comic book in fiction form. And if you don't go into it that way, you're gonna bang your head against a wall at all the nonsense."
5,Pilates Magic Circle,An easy to use and excellent addition to mat class. This circle provides just the right amount of resistance.
4,Magic Circle works great!,"The magic circle works great. The DVD is a good start, but not an actual workout video."
2,Pilates Magic Circle,"I have tried to like this product, as I am interested in pilates.However, it is difficult for me to use, especially holding it between the knees & thighs. It hurts to squeeze & bruises me. I found that a 25 mm ball is a better choice."
2,"Pretty good circle, AWFUL video","As a pilates instructor, and someone who remembers the 80s and knows it's the 2000s I can't for the life of me understand why the video for this power circle appears to be from 1982! The woman is wearing a white unitard with a matching white scrunchy in her long braided hair, there is a filter on the video--circa Barbara Walters 1980 interviews. And the exercises and explanation of the exercises look as bouncy and as dangerous as old jazzercising of the 80s.The woman appears to be in pain while she does the exercises and I would say that only 1/3 of them are performed correctly, and/or legitimate exercises."
3,Magic circle on the jaw?,"I picked this up in yet another attempt to get my flabby self in line. These are good exercises, but not quite up to snuff with true pilates.Pilates to me is all about being on the mat, using the core, and pushing yourself to the limits. The magic circle is, basicly, your resistance in lieu of free weights or a weight machine. I understand some of them (the famous Thigh Master moves, for example), but some are a little ridiculous like using the magic circle on your jaw and neck. Can you really make them stronger with this thing? Also, you use this as substitute for a ball or another object you would be holding or passing as you do other excersises. If you don't have a ball, or don't have enough space to keep one at home, this is a good alternative.Otherwise, it's just alright. Go with another pilates DVD without this thing."
5,"This is the one you want, don't skrimp pennies, get this one.","This is the magic circle you want. I tried other magic circles including one from Sports Authority and this one not only appears to be better made, but also operates better. Don't save your pennies, this magic circle can last you a lifetime. I've given mine a decent test:resistance - stiff, but operableease of use - very, it's a circle, duh**But this one has the added advantage of both abductor and adductor work (inner/outer thigh) because of the handle placement**durability - high, the foam handles are soft yet very durable, not likely to crumble anytime soonappearance - sleek, as sexy as you can get with a magic circle - it is actually a circle, some of the other ones are more oval . . . that changes the entire dynamic of the work you are trying to do. Perfection in pilates is paramount to success!!I do not use their video, but the circle is fabby enough in it's own right. Happy Hundreds!"
1,Stamina oilseed magic circle,"The circle is too soft. I expected one same as I use at Pilate studio, unfortunately one I ordered from amazon was much softer."
4,Not for the uncoordinated!,"I'm not coordinated myself and it has taken a while to get used to it. Hubby and I both do it and are getting better as we get more time under our belt. The dvd has a stand alone section, a section that requires a machine(sorry, I'm not buying that), and a mat section. The dvd is good and often you would pay $24.99 for the pilates dvd by itself."
5,Good choice,"A good product especially for beginning Pilates clients . Gentler touch on handles which is good for sensitive skin. Worth the money, I would buy more."
4,"DVD was useless, but wonderful toning tool!","The items included in this package arrived as described, however i was expecting a better workout DVD included with the circle. The dvd started out with about 10 minutes of exercises you could do with the magic circle by itself and the rest of the DVD was workouts that you can do using other pilates products with the circle added. The circle though, is a pretty good resistance tool, i was skeptical about its stability because it was so light, but i was impressed with what it can take. I plan on using the circle in my own way, because setting up my laptop and skipping past the talking only to get ten minutes (what is supposed to be a full body workout) is pretty pointless."
2,soft squishy and easy to bend out of shape,The title says it all! I am not young or athletic but this thing is useless! I thought it would be like the one at the pilates studio and give me a workout. It does not and I suspect it will bend and become an oval instead of a circle very quickly.
4,Pilates Magic Circle,"I would have given this product 5 stars, but the video was not up to standards for someone who is really into Pilates. Each exercise is demonstrated very fast, and there is not much exercise at all. On theother hand, the magic circle is great! It is well made, and can take a punishment. This was the reason I purchased this item, because I needed a good circle to work with. Comparing other circles to this that cost a lot more this was by far the best product. I would highly recommend the circle, but would not recommend the tape. When I purchased this item, I also purchased the Classical Pilates Technique, The Complete Magic Circle Mat Series. This DVD has BASIC, INTERMEDIATE, ADVANCED, plus THE SUPER ADVANCED REFORMER MAT WORKOUT. The exercises are performed well with great timing. This is a video that everyone from the basic learner to the most advanced learner would absolutely love."
5,Works like a charm,"Video was B-O-R-I-N-G, but helpful for a beginner. Enough resistance for me. I like that I can take it with me anywhere I go. Really need to find a better video though - snore."
5,i love it,I am very satisfied with the Pilates magic circle and would recommend this product to anyone. It was just what I needed. Thanks
1,Totally Useless,This ring offered absolutely NO resistance. Quite useless esp for the price they charge for it. This is not a good productnow i will need to figure out a better product to buy
3,part of a computer no biggie,i don't know much about computers put its working as far as i knowi have a computer guy that takes care of it
4,For the philosophically minded,"This is the work in which Anselm (a midieval church father) presents his ontological argument for the existence of God. It's one of the most debated philosophical arguments for the existence of God in history. If you're new to phiosophy, you'd better have someone you can ask about after reading this. It's really difficult to grasp.But aside from that, Anselm has a lot of good things to say, and I found that I really liked his writing style. Whether for the sake of philosophy or theology, this is a good book."
4,Great resource for many,"This book was wonderfully practical and succint. I think the author did a fine job challenging Americans to consider that other cultures are different, not necessarily wrong.I purchased this book in preparation for a semester abroad, and though it is targeted more towards Americans staying abroad for a longer period of time, I found all of the information relevant and helpful none-the-lessI have only 2 complaints about this book. First, many of the resources the author refers to are out of print or unavailable. That was a point of frustration because many of the books seemed like excellent resources. Also, unfortunately, this book was published just prior to 9/11, an event which significantly affects American travelers.Despite these shortcomings, I highly recommend this book for anyone spending significant time abroad!"
1,Wow,"Definately not what I was expecting! I was looking for more than this book gave. I didn't find anything useful until halfway through the book and even then it was REAL broad.I was looking for more about how to live and work in an overseas country. While it had some good points, I'm glad I only paid a few dollars for this!"
1,Awful,"This book is terrible! Don't buy it! it is very condescending and generally stupid. It has a very high-and-mighty sophomoric attitude, while not really giving any worthwhile information. To add insult to injury, it is also out of date and contains misleading information. This book actually has excersizes to teach you what 'stereotypes' are, what 'culture' is, etc. Ugh."
1,Let the government tell you what to think,"You don't need to think for yourself. Let the communists do all your thinking for you. Your parents are wrong, christianity is wrong, but Socialism. facism and communism are right. The big government will be your family. Your mother and father, grandfather and grandmother, brother sister cousin.One read of this book and you will take your kids out of government run schools and teach them at home.This book is complete leftist propaganda garbage. Save your money."
1,THIS WOMEN IS FULL OF LIES,"The auther in this book is a liar and a fake! Her stories are exagerated and made up to make herself to look like some kind of victim. When in truth (Marie Cipriani) is her real name, is the one who is so mentally disturbed, that here she is 13 years later obsessing over a relationship that only lasted 8 months when she was 15. GET A LIFE!!!"
4,Great for traveling,"I bought this item to have to take on vacations. It allows you to have all items in the bathroom, and not have to look through the suitcase to find each item. Bag on bottom, keeps lots of little things in one place."
2,The bag that couldn't!,"Although this product was well-constructed and has a roomy main compartment, the rest of the bag proved to be useless. Trying to use the remaining compartments resulted in not being able to close the bag properly. The design does not allow for room taken up by the contents of the various compartments, and the only compartment that is really usable is the large, main compartment which defeats the whole purpose of having an organizer."
2,Toiletry Bag,Way too big for me - wish I would have paid more attn to the description. I can't believe that anyone could fill this item.I should have just stayed with my plastic bag.
4,Great case for the price,"It's very attractive - not too juvenile as so many of the cases are with the neon or baby pink colors- and holds my 5.5 generation 30GB snuggly. The inside back which goes against the metal part of your ipod is nicely padded and suede covered. The screen cover is solid - not just a flimsy plastic film, which I really like. Only drawback is that the wheel is not protected but that's the thing that needs it the least. I'm happy."
4,The Real Steve Miller,"I bought this album on LP in 1972, and I wore it out. This is the best of the ""Greatest Hits"" or ""Best of..."" that are out there on Steve Miller. The only thing about the album that I found disappointing was that ""Baby's Callin' Me Home"" wasn't on the album. That would have made it complete. I gave it four stars because of that."
3,"""The Best Of""? Not likely!","When I look at the 1972 ANTHOLOGY album, I wonder, WHO put this thing together? Of the 16 songs included, a full HALF of them are slow or downbeat, and it just seems to me there were quite a few tunes from among his first 7 albums that would have been better choices. This package clocks in around 62 minutes, while on my own I once compiled around 100 minutes worth of Miller's early songs-- and many of these were not among them! Still, at the moment, with 3 of his early 7 albums being out of print in America, this may be the only easy place to find ""Little Girl"", ""Don't Let Nobody Turn You Around"", ""Your Saving Grace"" and ""Journey From Eden"" on CD."
3,A Few Laughs,"I think I laughed 4 or 5 times, so those are 4 or 5 laughs I wouldn't have had otherwise. But this was not a particularly good read. Ironically, the most ""conventional"" part of the novel was its plot. Carolyn Hart has done a similar story, just to name one version off the top of my head. The catty authors and editors, the petty disputes and backstabbing--this is all so old. Arnie the Sleazebag got the best lines. Caron's personality seems to have been toned down, maybe too much so. And, as always in this series, Claire's motivation for becoming so involved with the other characters is the biggest mystery."
4,A CONVENTIONAL CORPSE by Joan Hess,"his latest Claire Molloy mystery is a hoot! In addition to the usual cast of characters, we meet five mystery authors and one editor who have come to Fayetteville, Arkansas to attend the first (perhaps only) ""Murder Comes to Campus"" mystery convention. Claire, who had hoped to sell tons to books to the 100 convention attendees, finds herself instead roped into managing the convention when the original organizer is hospitalized. Claire must deal with the 5 mystery guests of author and a troublesome editor, all of whom are based on real-life people. Joan Hess and St Martin's Press are sponsoring a ""Who Are These Characters Based On?"" contest, but alas, we in Arizona are prohibited from entering. I was able to figure out the real-life identity of 3 of the 6 characters (but am I right?). See how many you can figure out! Oh, and while you're at it, see if you can figure out whodunit. I was guessing until the very last page."
3,Disappointed,This book just didn't grab me. I finished it but the end was kind of anticlimatic. The thing that bothers me most is that the main characters never seems grow or change. Caron has been sixteen(and speaking in CAPITAL LETTERS) forever just as Claire has been Forty and in a going nowhere relationship with Peter Rosen. Enough already. This series needs a major overhaul!
3,Just good - but ....,"I don't know if I just wasn't in the mood for Joan Hess or what, but I did not consider this as good as some of her others books. You get use to crazy people and zany things happening in a Joan Hess book, but for some reason it kind of fell flat with me and I found myself being irritated more times than amused. Where it was good, I wouldn't give it any more stars than 3. I enjoyed her earlier books more."
1,What a disappointment!,"I could hardly wait for the next Claire Malloy book. I'm just glad I didn't waste money on the hardcover. Instead of funny quips and jabs Claire is just plain annoying. Has Joan Hess run out of new things to say? I finished the book because I paid money for it but it was a difficult read, I'm sad to say. I always looked forward to her Arly Hanks and Claire Malloy series, but next time I'll check them out at the library so I don't dish out the cash."
2,Paging Arly Hanks,"I started reading the Claire Malloy mysteries because I am a huge fan of Joan Hess' Maggody, Ark. series. While never as good, the Malloy books were always a fun, quick read. Lately, however, the series seems to have taken a distinct turn for the worse. While the Maggody books continue to be ribald, wry and blissfully silly, the Malloy books have become muddled, badly written and stale (culminating in this negligible installment). It's interesting how the same writer can miss so consistently with some characters and hit the target so often with others. I've decided to skip Claire Malloy's future exploits and stick with Sherrif Arly Hanks and friends."
3,Does The End justify the means?,"Joan Hess's Claire Malloy books are usually more down-to-earth than the Maggody books, and usually make more sense. Trying to figure out which mystery authors her characters were based on made the book even more of a challenge, and being a mystery fan, it made the book more fun for me. The characters were interesting; the plot was convoluted enough for any puzzle freak; Claire's relationship with Peter was suitable frustrating. I hope Ms. Hess does not do as she threatened and have him encounter another chicken truck. But the ending made NO sense. It was out of character for the character she had developed. I'm not even sure the woman could have physically done the dirty deed with the handicaps Ms. Hess had saddled her. I loved it until the last five pages."
5,strongmans his name,I have not only bought this book for myself but others excellent book. Recommend highly in any deliverance ministry.Pastor Brenda
5,This book answers all the questions I ever wanted to know,"This was the best book on spiritual warfare, ever found, all my questions were answered. The chapter on Vietnam Vets was life saving for one man in our church. We are currently using both of the Strongman I and II in a weekly Bible Study."
5,balanced teaching,"This is probably the best teaching on spiritual warfare I've read. It expounds on the their other book, ""Strong Man's His Name, What's His Game. I highly recommend that you to get both. The first gives you the understanding of the biblical principles at work and the latter, the practical steps on how to ""do"" spiritual warfare. The Robeson's have an anointing to teach on this subject with a non-complicated, biblically-sound approach, which leaves the reader with a response of ""Okay, I get it."""
2,Not worth the price,"I can officially say that this eyeliner makes me mad every morning I try and put it on. No matter to what length I make the liner, it still lands up breaking off and going everywhere. The color does however last all day, but I hate the fact that it breaks off so easily!!"
5,Best eyeliner!,"Best eyeliner pencil I've used. You don't need a sharpener with it, it blends out easily if you want to smudge it to soften the look. I have gotten a dry one in the past...but that only happened once and since then I've tried all the colors without a problem. Smooth color, good staying power and no dragging! They can be hard to twist at first but once they get going it works great. Mine doesn't start to break until I get to the very end or if I twist it up too far.Avoid shipping fees and take advantage of special offers by going through a local rep or their online store."
1,worse eyeliner ever.,"i dont know if it was just an old eyeliner, or dried out or what, but mine just keeps breaking, most of it is being wasted, the twisty tube is broken, does not roll out easy, you have to work with it, the color is beautiful and pigmentation as well, if only the formula and packaging lived up to it. definitely not worth the price. i rather buy a jordana $1.99 one from walgreens."
2,only 2,"only 2 stars because this eyeliner isen't worth the price.. and to add shipping, well.. my own fault."
1,They don't sell replacements for that glass lampshade,"I liked my Stiffel torchiere, until it got bumped and I needed a replacement shade. Stiffel has been bought by Salton, who does not offer to sell replacements. I called, and they referred me to Lowe's or Penney's. But Lowe's doesn't have replacements, either. I've searched the web, tried other lamp suppliers, and so on. Still no luck. So far, the only way I have found to replace that shade is to buy a new lamp."
3,Good introductory text,"Luthi's study of fairy tales focuses on simplistic and straightforward analysis of plot, structure, style and meaning. He generally refrains from manipulating the process or projecting any apparent bias onto the study, but he also fails to delve deeply into any complex themes that would be useful for sholarly research of fairy tales. Tales are analyzed independently without much consideration for thematic patterns (gender roles, class issues, social structures, etc.).Luthi devotes a full chapter to ""The Image of Man in the Fairy Tale,"" a study of ""the hero"" without balancing that study with any discussion of the heroine. He also does not discuss villains as a category. Luthi's text is a useful introduction to the study of fairy tales but does not supply any truly relevant information for a higher level of study and analysis. Better choices are Maria Tatar and Jack Zipes."
2,Helpful for a complete beginner,"Bought the book hoping there would be detailed information for blueprinting a 4 cycle engine. Although it does give some suggestions & hints at what is needed, it does not go into depth on any subject. A complete beginner who knows nothing about 4 cycle engines might find this slightly helpful, most anyone with much experience with 4 cycle engines would probably find the information contained in the book ""old news""."
2,use the net,"I found this book to be very basic. If you want real information, get it from your doctor, a class or from the net. Everything here is just plain logic."
4,"Showing its age, but some good stuff","I guess it is hard to produce a book at the start of a product's development cycle, so anything written in 2000 has to be looked at with some skeptism in 2003 as so much has changed between now and then. However, while the technology has moved on, the advice here is pretty solid. It just needs to be updated with everything that has happened since 2000 (like the Exchange service packs). I assume that the publisher will employ a new copy editor to pick up the typos, but there does seem to be a second edition around because I couldn't find some of the problems reported in other reviews in my copy. It'll be interesting to see what Redmond makes of Exchange 2003 when it hits the streets."
2,"Often incorrect, hard to read and little practical advice","I had heard good things about this book and I had high expectations when I purchased it. The biggest advantage to this book is that it has lots of ""inside"" information about Exchange. Much of the ""inside"" information is of little value other than for trivia. The book is rife with incorrect information, typos, wordiness and contradictions. There were screen captures that did not exist in the released product, so I can only assume given the release date of the book that it is based mostly on the beta product. If you want good technical data or best practices, you may be lucky and find it in this book. But due to the errors I found during my first few hours reading it, I will question the legitimacy of anything I may read in this book. Mr. Redmond should focus more on technical accuracy, solid recommendations, and less on Exchange trivia."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"I fell asleep reading this book. Good infos but need to dig for them. Alot of background info that I don't need to know. If you're going to buy this book, be prepared to skim through useless background info to get to the useful tips."
5,Refreshing,"Enough with the religious types, the atheists, and even the political wannabes who are abusing this space to promote their own ideas. I mean really - how did a rant against John Kerry get into a review of ""The God Gene""?I actually read this book and found it refreshing. Hamer starts out with a question - why is religion still such a big part of peoples' lives? - and tries to answer it the way scientists do - looking at data. The chapters on twins and siblings were especially interesting. Some of the material on brain chemicals and genes were hard going, but every once in a while the good Doctor lightens things up with a zinger, like the one about Monica Lewinsky.The one complaint I have is the title. This book really isn't about God at all. It's about us humans and how we work."
2,"Interesting, perhaps provocative, but filled with errors.","""Hormones...are proteins."" The sex hormones are sterols. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are catecholamines . No resemblance to proteins! ""Thalamus and hypothalamus are parts of the limbic system."" Wrong. Hamer is confused about the 3 molecules forming the crux of his argument: norepinephrine, dopamine (""feel good molecule"", but it causes paranoia and psychosis) and serotonin (""the brain chemical involved in negative emotions"") The opposite is true: depression is relieved by serotonin."
1,self-seeking blather,"Hamer sensationalizes. It is a truism to say that every aspect of human behavior is influenced by genetics as well as environment. Like most human attributes, a religious bent can be adaptive or non-adaptive in different situations, and may or may not have been selected for, issues Hamer essentially skips. Hamer provides no useful insight into the human religious impulse, scientific or otherwise, while making sure to stir up plenty of controversy. Not a useful book."
3,The God Gene,"Is the book interesting, yes! Is it scientific, no! To suggest that indetical twin became nuns thus faith is in our gene, is really a little fatr fetched. I am grossly disappionted!"
3,A decent survey...but not a deep one,"Persinger and Wilson may be deeper, but, let's face it, for most of us Hamer is probably the better guide to the new study of spirituality's biological foundations. He makes a compelling case for the existence of these, in a readable sweep of current thinking on the subject.His writing slips up from time to time; for example, when he implies that serotonin causes depression when he really means to say the lack of serotonin does. In a survey text like this, that's a venal sin at most.My greater complaint is that Hamer jumps to some sappy conclusions about the evolutionary advantages of religiosity, willfully dismissing its demonstrated military and reproductive effects to focus instead on the supposedly superior health and happiness of religious people. Biologically speaking, that seems a stretch."
1,I want my time back...this is bad science,"All the negative reviews about this book being a rehashing of other's research and a classic case of ""confirmation bias"" that is a mark of poorly conducted science are true. I finished it because I hate leaving things unfinished, but the conclusions drawn in this book are false. Religious beliefs are the result of cultural upbringing and human psychological needs, not genetics. Besides, epigenetics have shown that whether one has a gene or not, it's expression is dependent on many variables in the environment."
3,"Dean Hamer is a good scientist, but mostly wrong on the subject at hand","Read chapter 4 (p.47-57) of Contending with Christianity's Critics: Answering New Atheists and Other ObjectorsPaul Copan(Editor), William Lane Craig (Editor). This chapter refutes most of Hamer's claims is by Micheal Murray(PhD Notre Dame). More in depth book on dualism in response to materialism(which Hamer is suggesting) read Beyond Death by JP Moreland and Gary Habermas. Both of these, I think, are worth the time to check out so the evidence can be weighed as if we are just hardwired or is there more to the human person than just the hard-wiring? Thank you."
4,Heuristic,"Hamer is an excellent writer. He has a light style that is seductive. He works hard at appearing neutral but of course if you buy his argument you would find it hard to believe in God. After reducing religious belief to possesion of a certain somatic allele and religious ecstasy to temporal lobe epilepsy, its hard to reserve any space for transcendental notions. So be it.I expect that over the next few decades we will read a number of books on this topic which are more cautious. Hamer seems to be like John Kerry in Viet Nam - desparately seeking recognition. This book is heuristic not compelling. Hamer seems to have rushed into print to get his name associated with this idea. To date the evidence is thin. I think he's on the right track but there is nowhere near enough evidence yet to seriously judge this theory."
3,Said it all,"I was going to write a review... But, everyone else has said it already. I did, however, keep getting confused with his use of spiritual versus religious. He tended to want to fuzzy the difference and call the religious spiritual, then differentiate them again. Didn't work."
1,One mans trash is another mans treasure,"I got this book because my mentor whom I respect a great deal says he refers to it everytime he is about to do a campaign. I find this book is not for the average marketer but perhaps someone who have done a whole buncha campaigns. Perhaps the book has great advice from different experts, but for me it is information overload and out my league. The arithmatic and analysis is too uncomprehensive for me to understand. Also, if your new and are self taught without anyone to ask for advice or break down the book then you will waste a large portion of your time with this. I felt like I needed to be in a classroom with a teacher armed with chalk and chalkboard to help me understand what was being said at times. I guess this book is more like a text book format, not, for the casual reader. I just like to get to the nitty gritty of things and this book isn't a get down to it and do this kind of book."
3,LeCreuset Is Falling Down.,I purchased this 3 1/2 gt. French Oven for my wife who has several other sizes in her collection. Apparenly LeCreuset is falling down -- badly -- with regard to quality control... The cast iron lip of the main body had four(4) chips in it thus ensuring anything but a tight fit while the lid had several chips as well [in the cast iron]. The enamel itself was without blemish. This little pot cost approximately $200.00; At that price I think it should be without fault...SO MUCH FOR THIS FRENCH COMPANY.. IN FUTURE I WILL TRY TO FIND PRODUCTS MADE IN THE U.S.
5,A reference book in gas-solid processes,"This is an advanced book in two-phase flows. It is an excellent reference for researchers in gas-solid processes. The book can also be used as a textbook in a graduate level course. Although there are many practical correlations and examples throughout the book, I found its approach more theoretical than applied."
1,Poor Quality,Stitching is already coming apart and I have not used them yet! Also if you buy replacement zipper pulls from Wal-Mart they ar a whole lot less expensive and will do the same thing.
2,"Stitching Off Center, Does Not Fit G3","First, the product needs some quality control as on one of the loops, one side of the strap is off center thus exposing part of the strap under the central stitching (I would post a picture of it if I could). Second, the straps are too thick to go through the loops of my DMC-G3 camera."
1,Oh my gosh! This is pretty bad!,"I am a huge fan of Air, and I was so happy to hear this album by one of its members was coming out. What a disappointment! There may be a couple of songs that are okay, but most of them are just embarrassingly awful..like TV Destroy. UGGHH! The lyrics in these songs leave a lot to be desired.I will say Bathroom Spirit is fairly good and At the End of the Sky is sort of catchy. Maybe How Brave You Are will grow on me, but that is about it. Although.... I was REALLY hoping for La Femme D'Argent or Kelly Watch the Stars quality."
1,who is running the show,"my goodness - being a fan of both Al Pacino and Kim Basinger, this was so sad - why did they even bother - at least follow up on a plot you tried to create - what a shame!"
1,A waste of Al Pacino's acting ability,"There are so many faults in this movie, it's hard to know where to begin. The story makes no sense, there are many holes in the plot. Pacino has a terrible southern accent (I saw the movie in Italy where it has already been released and was reading the subtitles at first because I couldn't tell he was speaking English). The relationship between the characters is never made clear. The motivation for why they are doing what they are doing is unclear and totally unbelievable in some situations. At the end of the movie you will be asking yourself, besides why did I waste my time watching this, what happened?"
4,Don't be so sad Mister Pacino!....,"I've been admiring Al Pacino for years, and though i must admit this film could had been better than it is... it's always an extraordinary lesson for us to go and see such an amazing actor playing like that!! in many scenes, the despear he gives us sounds like if he was playing his own life!!!The character is not an actor here, (or should i say a ""movie-star""??) but there is such an evidence between what he plays and what we can easily suppose he must endure as an actor too, that we are sometimes more thandeeply touched by this sudden broken voice he has....It's difficult to me as a french to express very well what i exactally felt after that.... but it reminds me this famous sentence of Maria Rilke, that i heard it once Pacino used to like too: ""Who speaks of triumph? Endure is everything""..."
2,WHAT'S THE POINT?,"Consider Michael Corleone in dementia. A pillhead publicist, who has seen better days, with a southern drawl in badly need of a comb. Perhaps in better need of a viable plot, script, whatever. Mr. Pacino is a fine actor but wasted here.However, Robert Klein, whom I have always considered an under-rated actor, is great. And Kim Basinger is beautiful, really lovely. And that's the 2 stars I rate this film."
1,From the Founder of the All-Movie Guide,"Just a terrible movie, through and through. When Pacino strikes out, he does it big time. We get to watch Pacino play a burned out, sleep-deprived, drug-confused PR man wandering around New York. And there is no relief. His supposed-Southern accent is worse than a joke; it reminds you in every phrase what a waste of time you are stuck in.Kim Basinger, who look great, is hardly on screen at all as his would-be lover, but Pacino looks more like her father (albeit on his deathbed) than a lover. Why would she have anything to do with this loser? This pairing just does not compute.Ryan O’neil, Richard Schiff, and Robert Klein turn in good work, but far too little to save the film, where Pacino is on-screen almost all the time looking like someone hit him with a baseball bat. When Pacino is good, he can be very, very good, but when he is bad, he is horrid. Here he is horrid. Sorry.-- Michael Erlewine, founder All-Movie Guide (allmovie.com)"
3,Not good.. Not bad.. Regular drama.. Is not Al Pacino best performance,"I will be short, this is movie is about drugs and knowing people. Al Pacino is a great actor. There are only like three lines in this movie: 1) Come to the palms 2) Blackout 3) Xanax and valium. Is the same bs going around and around; so many good actors for such a poor movie. Do not buy this!!"
2,A confused mess!,"A great cast is wasted in this boring, pointless film. After a terrific start, it all falls flat, and very quickly. This had a lot of potential, but ultimately, it goes nowhere. For one, the film doesn't know if it wants to be a character study or a suspense thriller. It doesn't work as either of them, but had lots of potential had it taken the latter route. As it is, everything is a jumbled mess that doesn't make much sense and entertains even less. The actors somewhat redeem it, but it's not worth seeing to begin with, not even for Pacino fans."
4,good condition*,"My merchandise came in a timely fashion, unlike the statistics book that ive been waiting on for 2 weeks. its a used book. but contains no markings in chapters. the front cover is bent but in good condition none the less."
5,LeCreuset enameled cast iron 7 1/4 qt,The item was delivered in record time. The pot was exactly what we expected. Will definitely return to this site for future purchases.
1,Did absolutely nothing to my tires.,"I purchased this product based on the good reviews it received here on Amazon. I used it on my truck tires, following the instructions exactly. As I sprayed it on the tires and rubbed it in, it already looked like it wouldn't turn out ""wet"" or ""glossy,"" but I figured I would give it a day...maybe it took some time? Nothing happened, it dried, and then my tires looked like I had done absolutely nothing to them. Would definitely not recommend this product."
4,"Works well, but requires rubbing.","Works well, but requires that you rub it in with a rag or towel. It's not a thin watery spray like you'll find in dealership shops, but rather a little bit thicker, and you're supposed to rub it in, then wipe the excess off.In dry weather and on clean-ish roads, it'll last quite a while. A week or two is pretty good in my book.All in all it's a good product, but not quite as easy to use as the pro-grade stuff the shops buy in bulk. (though that stuff can be good or crappy, depends on the shop. My local Audi dealership has decent stuff, and it's less thick, more of a spray.)"
4,Solid Tire Shine,"Mothers FX Tire Shine does make my tires look very good. This spray gives the tires a clean ""just washed"" look without being ultra shinny and fake looking.The reason I can't give this product 5 stars is because it doesn't last. My tires look dull and flat again within a day or two. I don't expect it to last forever but it just doesn't last as long as whatever they use at my local car wash. I wanted it to match their solution in quality and it just doesn't quite make it.Mothers FX is a great product and I will continue to use it but I will also be keeping my eye out for something a little longer lasting."
3,Neither Amazon nor the supplier tells you this is MENS sizing!,"This may sound stupid, but the shirts are not pictured on a model, & nowhere on the page does it say it's a mens shirt, in MENS sizing. If it's so ""obvious"", from some category that the supplier puts it in on Amazon, then why when I click on sizing info does it not automatically show me MENS sizing? I got this as a gift from someone who thought they were ordering a women's Large."
2,Not what I expected.,"I bought this shirt after I put ""Field and Stream Flannel shirt"" in the search thing. It said it was heavy duty, and came up under the Filed and Stream logo, but it is made by a company in China and heavy duty is NOT what I would call this flannel shirt. It is lightweight, not like the Field and Stream shirts I am used to. Someone needs to teach them what a real heavy duty flannel shirt is like. I will return them and go to costco where I can get them for a better price and get the one I wanted. So hard to shop for clothes on line...."
2,"Good shirt, but beware.","I really want to like this shirt, the material is soft and thick and is comfortable to wear. However, I did have problems with mine. The shirt shrank a full size (from XL to L) after the first washing. Also, the shirt comes with white pearl buttons, a black plaid shirt should come with black buttons, IMHO."
2,"not ""extra heavy weight""","this is a decent flannel, but definitely not heavy weight in my book. maybe mid-weight. just as a heads up you can get a much better and much heavier flannel for $13 at costco."
2,Not Heavyweight At All,I was very disappointed with this item. I was expecting some overly rugged work flannel but what I received was a very low quality product. I doubt the shirt is made from 9 ounce cotton as advertised. It doesn't feel the least bit rugged nor is the durability to be taken seriously....more like flannels you see in walmart for a lot less.Made in china.
2,undersized,I really liked the heavy flannel material but it way undersized. I gave it to my dad. i would not choose for large person
2,lightweight,Too light to be labeled an extra eight heavy weight. And it had pearl colored buttons. Not great wouldn't recommend
5,Greatr Shirt,"I purchased already several of these, now my brother wanted one, great size, extra fast shipping, great quality, it is definitly a great product!"
3,Beware of shrinkage!,"Seemed nice enough--until it was washed. It shrunk in the length, although not badly, but...the sleeve length changed considerably. Consider ordering a tall if you need longer sleeves."
2,The Size Is All Wrong!,"I am a legitimate XXL (but I'm on a diet) and so I ordered an XXXL because I wanted to wear it as a light jacket. The shirt is too small to even wear as a shirt! The sleeves come half way up my arms! The fabric is fine, but the sizing is way off!"
1,poor sizing,I received three of these shirts for Chirstmas. I ordered them in a 3x to be sure they would be loose fitting and 1 shirt I ordered in a 4x. The 3x fit like a XL and the 4x fit like a 2x. Not at all what I expected. I am very dissapointed.
1,Bought larger size but still shrunk too small,"My husband can usually wear1XL but bought 3XL to allow for shrinkage. It was a little long and big before washing but the shirt shrunk so small after washing that he could not wear it. The sleeve length shrunk by 3 inches, the shirt length shrunk by as much and the whole shirt was tight with the buttons closed.Very disappointed , returned the items, ordered replacement shirts from Lands End.Do not buy this shirt if you want to avod the hassle of having to return it, Besides, it's priced too high for what you get."
2,Shrinks!!!!,"I bought this for my fiance who is acutally an XXL, however I bought it in an XXXL so it's loose and comfy on him. When I received it, it was the perfect size. BUT, when I washed it only ONCE it shrunk to almost smaller than an XXL!! For the price of this item and the fact that it shrunk so much after only one wash, I absolutely hate it and it's not worth your purchase."
1,Including a size chart would be nice.,"I have always bought 4x and 3x shirts and typically have not had a problem. Also I usually check the size chart when included. This shirt however did not have a size chart with it in the description so I went with something I knew would fit, and chose a size that generally would leave a little extra room in. This shirt is definitely not a typical US 4x. In comparison to other shirts its more along the lines of a 2x."
2,Size doesn't match,Size was way off and had to send it back. Not even close to fitting. Need better labeling or measurements on shirts.
2,Beware of this Shirt,"I had high hopes. The shirt looks great, but then I washed it and now my wife is enjoying it. I'm 6'1"" and wear an XL my wife is 5' 5"". Too Bad!!"
4,Narrow Cut-Heavy Shirt,"I like these a lot! We followed the suggestion to get them 1 size larger but I am going to suggest 2 sizes larger. If you plan on wearing them as a shirt by itself, no under shirt then 1 size larger may work OK. I'm 6'3 215 and got the 1X. I normally wear an XL. I have some hips and found the narrow cut of these to be tight in the hips. especially after wash and drying. I also have a 2 X that I was planning on using as a light coat but the narrow cut prevents that except when unbuttoned. Regardless I am quite happy with them, They are very thick and well made and very warm."
1,extra heavyweight brawny flannel,what a wast of money! the word extra heavyweight is a joke. the price is over the top. go to sears youll get a better flannel for your money.stay away!!
2,not a good deal,I bought 3 of these shirts for my husband and they are SMALL so order two sizes bigger for sure. I will not ever buy from this store again as I paid $31.99 for each shirt and they only refunded me $23.99 plus I had to pay $15 to ship them back - so basically its not worth it.
1,The other reviewers are not lying when they say it shrinks badly,"While the quality of these shirts looks OK from the beginning, one wash and you will see what others are talking about. I am being completely serious when I say that the arms shrank 3.5"" on each side, I had a new, unwashed shirt available to compare. Terrible, terrible stuff."
3,Order Bigger,"These shirts are good quality and just what I was looking for, too bad they run like one size too small. Other than that, there okay..."
2,DO NOT ORDER THIS SHIRT,"My husband usually wears a XL, I know flannel will shrink so I ordered 2X. It's way too small after it is washed and they cost too much for that to occur."
3,"Brawny yes, but also slim.","I bought the ""EXTRA HEAVYWEIGHT BRAWNY FLANNEL SHIRTS (3 XL, Red/Black)"" and found it to be good quality and a great retro look. The flannel is extra thick and warm and the colors are great. The color has stayed through washing but the shirt does shrink a bit if dried in a dryer. The only negative is this shirt is also cut very slim, so a 3x is more like a slim 2X. The slim cut was not mentioned in the writeup about the product."
3,I like The Eddie Bauer flannel better.,"This shirt is nice to keep you warm on a cold winters nite, but its not as soft and snuggley as the Eddie Bauer flannel,which I wear like a robe over my PJ's"
5,YANNI LOVE SONGS,"I LOVE THIS ALBUM SO MUCH THAT I BOUGHT ONE FOR MY BEST FRIEND AND A SPARE FOR MYSELF. EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS PERFECT~~~ MY GRANDDAUGHTER GOES TO SLEEP EVERY DAY WHEN I KEEP HER, TO THIS MUSIC. IT IS VERY RELAXING."
5,VERY GOOD,I LOVE YANNI AND I A BIG FAN OF HIS AND I HAVE 9 CD WITH HIM AND I LOVE ALL OF HIS MUSIC.TELL HIM I LOVE HIMFROM: SHAROM ANNMARIE PERSAD
3,The New Yanni!,I have been a fan of Yanni's for years until I ran across Bradley Joseph's music (Yanni's former keyboardist). If you like Yanni you will LOVE Bradley as he writes beautiful melodies and takes music were Yanni left off. Check him out at http;//www.bradleyjoseph.com
1,Word up to the last guy,Yanni once more creates an album full of nausea inducing songs. I can hardly look at my parents anymore for playing such trash. Not only are all of his songs the same but it sounds like he is making it up as he goes. I think Yanni needs to find some real talent instead of playing the same old song and dance over and over again.
3,Yanni has a message of love,"Yanni once told a Rolling Stone Interviewer that his style reacted against the intellectual elitism of jazz musicians...what was missing, he said at the time, was a sense of love, tranquility and peace. Well, Yanni has proven that music doesn't have to be about brains to garner recognition and change lives. He has touched a great many with his spiritual purity and prophetic professionalism. This album made me cry."
4,Listen and fall in love........!!!,"Yanni has become my favorite artist from the very first day I heard his music. When I listened to these pieces of music, I felt their soft whispers in my ears and I was flooded with an overwhelming feeling of tranquility. But when I listened to the masterpiece (First touch), I was instantly transformed into another realm and I thought.... Wow!! I've fallen in love. But simply with his music."
3,affordable adidas,"these shoes aren't the best but, for $30, they're ok. they're good to beat up, get dirty, and abuse. the soles, especially in the front part, are thinner then ideal but for this price one can't be too picky or demanding. if you're looking for high performance running shoes pass on these but if you want low cost, decent, running shoes buy 'em."
2,lighter than other annodized pans and a cheap hollow handle,"I bought this off teh cooks recommendation. I didn't like the handle that much. While it isn't flimsy, its not as strong as I would have liked-its hollowed out with rounded edges but not as nice as say the cooks line from JC Penneys (which I own a 8"" annodized nonstick skillet with eclipse nonstick coating that I love!!)The handle is two pieces riveted to the pan instead of one solid one. I'm not fond of that either...just seems cheaply designed but hey its not all clad!!!Add to it that when it arrived the pan was out of round but the box didn't look damaged at all. I may look at Penny's or Sears for this as Sears has one for less with no shipping charges.I'm a pretty avid Cooks fan and follow their recommedations but this one looks like they went for a real value oriented choice on this one."
5,great inexpensive pan,"this pan is really good for everyday use. eggs, pancakes etc.... now I only have to add butter for flavor if I DEsire instead of stick prevention! recomended by cooks illustrated, and it is a performer. a great size as well, not too small, not too big!"
2,wearever premium hard anodized 12 inch saute pan,I'm not very happy with it. The handle is too loose on it and it worrys me about it coming off. There is no way to tighten it.
4,Great non stick!,This non stick fry pan is great. Especially for the price. The last inexpensive pan I had peeled! I didn't think you could get a good quality pan if it wasn't All Clad. Highly recommend this non stick pan.
4,Exactly what I've been looking for!,"This has been the only book I've found that is a good canoeing guide for the rivers in TX (it includes AR and OK too). Each description is about 1 page in length and has the following sections: physical location, general comments, water quality, water flow, preferred seasons, hazards, put in, take out, camping, canoe rental & shuttle service, distinguishing features, fishing, maps and where to get river flow information. Each river also has a map that shows mileage, creeks, roads, etc. Overall, it was a good purchase but a little pricey."
3,"Great system, if it played N. American DVD's!!!","This sytem has great sound and seems to be well worth the money. My issue is with the receiver/DVD player that Amazon sent me. I unpacked the system and got all the speakers set up and organized all the wiring, put in a DVD and ""Region Error,"" came up on the screen. After 5 different calls to Samsung customer service I got the tier 2 ""specialist."" He never heard of the problem but researched it and told me that my DVD player must have been made for the Phillipines and that there is nothing I can do. I am in the process of returning the system and replacing it with one that is hopefully from the US, ridiculous."
5,Generator Control,Just as advertised. Arrived within a day or 2 of the order.Great price. Other sites wanted close to $500.Can't beat the free shipping.Have not installed it yet so I can't review the product itself.
2,Problems with swirls and residue,"I recently used this product on 2 family cars. The product went on very easy and was easy to remove and in the garage, the finish looked great. The problem was that when the car was moved into the sunlight, swirls were visible that could not be rubbed out using microfiber towels. Also, white residue was difficult to remove from cracks and crevices in the bodywork. I spent the next weekend with a random orbital polisher removing this product and applying another wax from a competitor. I had great hopes for this product but my experience was not good."
4,I like it,"been using this with powerball and also by hand, very easy to use, doesnt last like paste but I did 3 cars in less than 2 hrs. MBZ600sl, MBZclk430, ZO6 Corvette. All looked like new again, each bottle good for 4 or 5 waxings"
2,terrible streaking,"I ran out of Eagle One ""Wet"" waxing my single stage paint after polishing. I went in search of more, but found none. I like other Mother's products and tried the Syn Wax in paste form. The gloss level was equivalent to the Eagle One product, but as others have noted, streaking is readily apparent in full sun. I'm very disappointed. To answer troll reviewers who say I'm simply not using it correctly, I've got 15 yrs experience cleaning, polishing, and waxing car finishes. I'm very aware of how to use it properly. No amount of pressure with the microfiber cloth would take it off. I'm going to use 3M Finesse-It to remove the wax, and come back with a full carnuba wax."
5,Great Shine,"I've used a ton of waxes over the years, and this is the best. It goes on very easy and more importantly, is easy to remove. There is no waxdust when removing, unlike a number of other brands. Also, it does not leave a haze or swirl film when you're done. The SynWax is not thick or heavy, and a little bit goes a long way.The only unknown I have is how long it will hold up, as I've only had it on for a few months, but so far it's great. It's goes on and off so easily, that I won't mind having to reapply it as needed."
1,A Mediocre Outing,"This is a dreadful CD. The songs alternate between sentimental, grating numbers of the ""Stardust"" variety and more up-tempo, bluegrassy numbers. Mitchell's voice has a ""cold"" quality that isn't suited to the material. It's almost worth buying the CD, though, to listen to Mitchell kill Don Henley's ""Heart of the Matter,"" which she delivers in song-song fashion, like a stern minister delivering an admonishing sermon, inexplicably emphasizing some words over others. It's a hoot. However, by the time Mitchell does a surreal, upbeat, bluegrass version of The Rolling Stones' ""Mother's Little Helper,"" complete with a Klezmer violin sawing away in the background--totally missing the somewhat dated, social criticism of the song--the joke wears a little thin. One bright note is the self-penned number, ""Miss You Boy."" With so much great music in this genre out there, there's no reason to linger on this vapid disk."
5,A great read,I found the third book one of the best of the trilogy. I read all three and highly recommend them all. Have fun.
3,Choose a genre and stick with it.,"For what it's worth, it is NOT a bad watch, but can definitely stand to be better. It intermingled Comedy, Horror, Action and a pinch of Drama in this Cantonese flick. And the subtitles aren't even close to the spoken language. Picture quality is also a 3 out of 5. It almost looks like a port to DVD for VHS."
1,unreadably dense,"With solid background in analysis and discrete probability from math and CS departments both ranked high in the top 10, I still could get absolutely nowhere with this book as a textbook for a graduate-level intro to probability theory. It is just incredibly dense and unreadable.I'm willing to believe that it may make for a good reference for specialists, but do not do your students a disservice by trying to use it as a textbook at any level."
1,Poor Book,"I completely agree with the readers from Madison(Wisconsin) and (Chicago), I don't agree with the author."
1,Poor books,"I completely agree with the readers from Madison and Chicago, I don't agree with the author."
3,Winner of the most dense....,"Durrett's book would be almost the ideal text, or at least ideal reference book, on basic probability if he would just re-do the type setting, providing more space and make things easier to read, and generally more aesthetically pleasing. He also desperately needs to more clearly delineate the sections, subsections, problems, and results - maybe even use the tab key once in a while, or use bold or a different font to highlight important items! Of course this would necessitate doubling the number of pages of the book.....Also, his notation is quite arcane at times and his proofs sometimes unnecessarily involved.Billingsley is almost always a better learning aid."
1,A good Reference Book,"I agree with all those who rated this book below or equal to 2 stars.I don't agree with the author.His book is only good as a reference book for those who have mastered the contents( for example, the professors who have taught probability for their entire lives and take for granted that every line in the book is trivial. If it is indeed trivial, why bother to write a book! what is a textbook for?)For my own experience, to follow this book, I have to read everything from Billingsley's textbook!"
2,Lacks a usable index,"While attempting various homework problems or reading the text, I often find that I would like clarification on the specifics of a definition. Almost invariably, the index does not contain a reference to the material I need.Here's an example:Let's say I want to do exercise 6.8 on page 51, which involves the Poisson distribution. I want to have the precise definition of a Poisson distribution (this information can be found on pages 19 and 91). I look under ""Poisson"" in the index and find:Poisson approximation 36Poisson convergence 135Poisson process 143, 147, 150Because the exercise is on page 51, it seems that Poisson approximation on page 36 is my best bet. On page 36 I cannot find a single occurrence of ""Poisson,"" though I do see ""Polynomial approximation."""
5,Worth getting several...,"I have used many wooden cutting boards through the years and had to get rid of many because of mold and stains. I never liked plastic boards because I thought they would ruin my knives, and some would have because of the cheap material used. However, this cutting board is a joy to use: the size is perfect for the dishwasher, lightweight enough to be picked up with one hand and transfer food to the pan, very steady and secure on the counter, and is a dream to clean. Does it get scratched from the blades? Yes, so did my wooden cutting boards, but now I don't have to work so hard in cleaning them. I got 2 (black & red) and also a prep board...prefect for slicing a tomato or a lemon. Best value for the price!"
3,Good until it isn't,"We've had this cutting board for about 1.5 years. At first I really liked it as it does have all the great qualities that others have mentioned. However, knife use over time has caused the board to be cut up to the point that it is coming off in small pieces. I have another plastic board that is older and worn/cut from knives but is not coming off in pieces like this one. We use it maybe once or twice a week so I don't know if you would consider that really heavy use, but I don't want to eat plastic pieces in my food. I'm having to throw it away and buy a new cutting board now. It was nice while it lasted but don't expect to invest in it and have it last forever."
4,OXO cutting board,This cutting baord is the right size for my tiny kitchen. I bought the board with the red edge because I wanted a little bit more color in my kitchen. I am a little surprised to have a slightly rough surface after using it to crack and peel hard boiled eggs. My paring knife has made a few scratches in the surface but it is okay. It is a nice cutting board.
5,Want more!,I love this cutting board! I want more just like it. This cutting board does not slip and slide and is great. Has an indentation on one side for meat juice to wait in. I cook almost every evening Monday through Sunday. Going to add some more to my kitchen in the future! Best cutting board I've ever own.:)
5,CUTTING BOARD,This is a wonderful cutting board...stays in Place..nicesize also and a great Item in our Kitchen..but If youknow someone getting Married? this is a great Gift Item..very useful..Would buy it again.
1,Again Cheap soft plastic.,"Like my review on another style cutting board, one use and useless. I am shocked at OXO. Thought they meant Quality. Deep cuts with an unhoned knife that actually created strings of plastic that will get into the food. Must be recycled plastic or a cheaper type.Follow-up:Type of plastic used in the construction is the reason for my issues. Not being an expert I will just say that all Polys are not created equal and caveat emptor."
1,Not the size stated,"Length:: 1:06 MinsI dont understand why Amazon does not check to see if the product they sell are what they are stated to be from the manufacture. As you can see on the video this cutting board is not 15 inches as stated, when I ordered this I measured my sink and it was 14 1/2 inches across the opening, the cutting board would have been big enough if it was 15 inches but at 14 3/8 inches there is no way it fits, I dont have any extra counter space to use it there, so it is basicly useless for me. What has happened to truth in advertising? The width is only an 18th of an inch short and if the length was only an 8th off I could use it."
4,Good Board,Good cutting board. I like the red rubber ends. It keeps the board from sliding and is much safer than a regular board.
4,Small but effective.,"When I work with a cutting board, I need for it to stay put, so that my knife doesn't cut my finger. The rubber edges on this cutting board make it possible to keep the thing in place without using a rubber shelf liner to keep it staying put. One annoyance that I have is that the edges are bevelled and thinner than the rest of the board. This means that the actual rubber ""feet"" that stay in contact with your countertop are thin. It's irritating, because it doesn't provide as firm as grip as it could, if the rubber bits were thicker. If the edges were the same thickness as the board itself, the entire rubber edge would provide the grip. Because it's these little feet, the grip isn't solid enough."
3,Disappointing Cutting Board,"Because of the price (high), I thought this OXO cutting board would be superior. The board is attractive (mine is red), has the right thickness, and it's easy to pick up. What's disappointing is the hardness. It scratches at the lightest touch, no different from its cheapest competitors. (P.S. The listed 15"" length is closer to 14"" - no big deal, but annoying.)"
5,A Unique and Useful Contribution,"It is a rare planning book that outlines a detailed process for guiding landscape change in a deliberate and ecologically sound manner. The Living Landscape accomplishes this in a robust, clear and convincing way. The second edition improves on the first by including more landscape design information, updating case studies, and deepening the planning method (for instance, by including more on the use of Geographic Information Systems). The liberal use of cases is a strong asset of the book; each step in the ecological planning process is illustrated and explained by way of 'stories' from real places around North America. The Living Landscape is useful reading for students and practitioners in landscape architecture, architecture, environmental planning and natural resource management."
4,The Living Landscape: An Ecological Approach to Landscape Planning,This product came very quickly and is in good condition. The book has great info and is easy to read.
1,Tasteless.,"I'm not a traditionalist by any means, but this music is ugly why play jazz versions of metal . . . just play metal.(negative stars aren't available?)"
1,"Mega means big, not many","I thought that I would be getting many stencils, not huges ones. I couldn't use them at home because they were so big. Ended up donating to a day care."
1,Disappointed,"Although this binder is indeed ""easy-open"", it opens while I'm turning multiple pages of my coupon binder so that they pull out of the rings. Also the rings aren't aligned well so it's very difficult to turn pages, as I have to tug them over the gap. Frustrating! I'm sad to have to be returning my first Amazon order ever. I'll find a different binder that has significant spring-action upon closure so that it will stay closed while I look through it."
4,I'd give it a 5 if it had real drums!!,"I'm serious, a lame drum-machine is no substitute for a drummer, which is a key instrument in any sort of rock band. It's a real annoyance. Garlands is otherwise a great Goth album, very different from the other Cocteau Twins albums. I consider it far better than the follow-up, Head Over Heels."
3,Siouxsie Impersonation,"Garlands is the first album in the long and seminal career of the Cocteau Twins. Fortunately, they developed their own style after about three LPs and stopped doing Siouxsie/Banshee goth guitar riffs. If unoriginal 80s gothic is your thing, buy this. If you want a completely unique sound, buy Treasure, the Twins masterpiece. There is one standout track on this album called Wax and Wane, a precursor of Elizabeth Frasier's other-wordly voice. She can create sounds I have never heard before and has influenced countless singers."
3,In the beginning....,"Having heard the Cocteau Twins on the This Mortal Coil compilation album, It'll End in Tears, I was interested in seeing how this group progressed from the post punk sound of the early 80's to the rich tapestry that they would eventually become. Garlands is a good album and for fans of the early 80's sound. it certainly is among the better sounding groups out there. However, it is not what I really like so the lower rating only comes from the fact that I know how wonderful they eventually sound!"
2,Floodstop,"This is an excellent idea, and quite practical, but it is not UL approved, and therefore unacceptable in some areas. Check with your local inspectors befoe installing."
5,What a riot!,"Sam & Max Hit the Road is a laugh riot! I truly laughed out loud many times while playing this computer game. There are too many games out there that contain things you wouldn't want your children to see. Not so with Sam & Max. This is just good, clean fun with unexpected, bizarre (in a fun way) things happening. You never know what strange thing is going to come up next! A wild and weird carnival? A giant ball of string? Bigfoot? They're all here. It's a game you won't want to stop playing... it's just too much fun!I've heard that an updated version of this game might be released in the future. I certainly hope so. I'll be the first to order it!"
2,First Review is a PLANT. This is the Worst of the Series!!! Horrible or Repeats!!,"This is by far the weakest in the series of Dance Factory Level (1-4). The person who wrote the previous review MUST have been a plant or is completely ignorant of good Club/House music. As somebody who owns all of the NYC Underground Hits, Dance Factory levels, Ultra Dance, and Bad Boy Joe Mixes, this CD was a huge dissapointment. The only 2 songs I liked were repeats (Fire). The remainder of the songs were cheesy remixes, nothing fresh here. Just absolute CHEESE! Louie, you are really killing me anymore with this cheese!!! Terrible songs and mixes except for 1-2 which I already owned on several prior CD's.Louie Devito CHEESED it up a couple of notches on this album. What a joke..."
4,car cable sound,is very good .sound is nice and clear. but not exellent. as I was specting to . but still do a good job almos cd quality sound.
5,Purchase worth it...,It has been few weeks since I bought this amaizing product. The sound quality that comes out of the car speaker system is same as you are playing radio. No hassle. Not a hard installation. As soon as I connected my zune via this cable it got recognized and started playing through audio system. I like it a lot. I would recommend everbody who needs this product type.
1,Fair,"This product works well enough, however, realistically, a much shorter version would be a better option for a vehicle. I mean, really, who needs 7 feet for a car? I ended up having to roll it up and tie it with twist ties to keep it from getting all tangled and looking messy in my car. Maybe some people like the long length, but then you should offer two options."
2,StereoLink,"First off, this is a great quality cable. Marketing a 7ft cable to Zune users in their car doesn't make any sense. If this was 3-4ft cable (I mean, how far away do you sit back from your dash??), it would be perfect. Buy a cheaper (and shorter) mini-stereo to mini-stereo cable!"
5,It Works!!,"I have a new 2010 MINI Cooper, but was unable to play my Zune HD in it. This cable allows you to play all of your favorite tunes, through the standard accessory outlet of your MINI! You can even operate the volume control at the steering wheel! It will not, however, charge the device. This cable is so much better than using an FM transmitter device, which has horrible reception. It is the best cable that I have come across, until Bill Gates comes up with a better solution for his products. ENJOY!"
5,Exactly what it says it is,"which is a relief. It is, in fact, the piano scores for the two concerti, arranged in four staves (mostly) with a very good piano reduction of the orchestral part. I couldn't find the credit for the piano reduction (didn't look very hard) but it is well done, and would suit very well indeed for a second pianist to play for rehearsal purposes.The piano score is just that; it looks as though it were a direct transcription of the original, and is blessedly free of fingering suggestions, someone else's idea of phrasing or dynamics, etc. etc. Which leaves the pianist to his or her own devices or taste.Binding is good. It really does sit flat on a music rack without resort to clothes pins or other impediments. I haven't had it long, so I can't say how sturdy it is -- but honestly, if you are planning to play this music, you would be wise to also be planning to memorise it, so that shouldn't be a problem."
2,so-so,"One would think that a movie about the South would at least have southern bands singing the songs. No one, not even Jewel, can top the orignial Sweet Home by Lynyrd Skynyrd, so why they didn't include the original is a mystery. Also, they left out the Charlie Daniels Band ""A Few More Rednecks"", which was in the movie.The good side is that Uncle Kracker's song is hella cool, and that The Calling does a faithful cover of ""Keep Your Hands To Yourself"" Ya should prolly just download the good songs off the internet instead of spendin'cash on this CD."
4,What is with the rest of you....?,"I had to type something to these ""so-called"" Jewel fans. Her cover rocks and if you like southern rock you will love this soundtrack. I recently moved away from Georgia and found this movie fun, scenic and romantic. Great music too!"
3,sweet jesus alabama,"the film, cute, the story, predictable, the soundtrack, interesting. some of the songs were a real treat (the calling, Jason chain) and i love jewel as much as the next alt rock fan but a lynyrd skynyrd cover?...Please! just kinda gave me the feel they should have put the dynamite under them when they sat in the studio and decided to try it. Also, a little disappointed by the avril levigne song, but hey she's young, she'll learn. generally though, you liked the movie you will like the cd."
5,"Gives you that warm, tingly feeling!","Though not your traditional source of music, I like soundtracks because they have the added value of offering the diversity often not found from a single artist. Sweet Home Alabama is definitely one of the better soundtracks out there and if you haven&#65533;t seen the movie, you need to! Reese Whiterspoon is absolutely darling and her &#65533;small town&#65533; husband is a &#65533;big time&#65533; hunk! The soundtrack has tunes that are refreshing and invigorating. There are also a couple tracks that are fastly becoming wedding favorites. Overall, the CD offers a mix of good old fashioned song writing, some kick off your shoes and relax beats and rhythms that leave you warm and tingly inside. I&#65533;m a sucker for romance flicks and after watching this oh so inspiring film, I had to get the soundtrack to cherish the memories. If not for you, for your friend who&#65533;s still waiting for her prince charming&#65533;.lol."
4,Surprisingly good!,"I loved the movie, but HATE country music. When someone bought me this Cd as a gift I expected it to be a bunch of hick music, but it was a great CD! It actually had all the music in the movie! The only thing I didn't like about the CD was taht Jewel sang ""Sweet Home Alabama"". I wanted to hear the original band play it, but this CD is definitely worth getting!"
2,Not really the music that rang in my head....,"Sweet Home Alabama is one of those rare movies that has a feeling that stays with you after you've left the theatre. I think the music in the film has a good bit to do with it. The last movie I bought a soundtrack for was Practical Magic. The CD captured the magic of the movie. It was the music from the movie.I ran out and bought the CD without really playing attention to the tracks, I knew I wanted the music from the movie. I was very disappointed when I got home and realized I only actually remembered two of these songs from the movie. Most disappointing was the fact that the two versions of 'Sweet Home Alabama' from the movie did not make the CD. No problem to find the Lynard Skynard version...but the soulful, slowed down version by the band at the Honky Tonk? Not there. The version that made the CD doesn't compare."
3,Pretty good Cd...,"The main reason I bought this Cd is because I am a huge Jewel fan and I wanted to hear her version of ""Sweet Home Alabama"". I give that song itself probably a 3 out of 5 too. She has much better work out there. I agree with the reviewer that said Sheryl Crow and Jewel should have switched covers. Anyway, the rest of the Cd is filled with some good and mostly mediocre songs. Other good ones to check out are Avril Lavigne's ""Falling Down"", The Callings cover, Shannon Mcally's song, and Dolly's song is decent. Overall, it's a pretty good Cd but they could have dropped a few in favor of higher quality tunes."
3,Almost happy,"It is an absolute shame that not every song you hear from the movie makes it onto the movie soundtrack.Why oh why do the so called experts think they know best. A good part of this movie is its soundtrack, and now it leaves you a little unfulfilled."
3,Movie is better than sound track,"Reese Witherspoon is wonderful and funny in this sweet movie,and I think the movie is much better than the sound track.Check out these great tracks nonetheless:- Mine All Mine, by SHeDaisy- Falling Down, by Avril Lavigne -- one of my favorite tunes- Sweet Home Alabama, by Jewel"
4,Wow,"I saw the movie and wanted to buy the CD, so I did. It really does bring out the movie and I find that it isn't the exact songs that capture the movie..if you listen carefully it's the words that capture the heart of the movie."
5,definitly a 2 thumbs up!,"this soundtrack is awesome! The jewel song ""sweet home alabama"" is very fun, and the avril lavigne song ""Falling Down"" is very uplifting, much better than the original songs on her album. I would definitly recommend this album to any true fans of country rock!:)"
4,Sweet Home Fun,This CD is good to mix into your play list. Some of the tracks won't be mixed in but overall it was good. Recommend sampling first.
2,Just okay cd........,"I gotta be honest, I ordered this with another cd and I just haven't enjoyed this one as much. I did love the movie, but this cd just didn't do it for me."
3,The movie was cute....,"....but there is now way you can replace Lynard Skynard's version of ""Sweet Home Alabama"". I adore Jewel, but for those of us who have grown up with this song, it's just not the same. The rest of the soundtrack is pretty good."
2,Muddle of illogic,"The book starts out okay with the description and translation of the Las Lunas NM inscription. The author seems to know the Hebrew language, both ancient & modern, very well. His interpretation of the inscription as the Ten Commandments makes sense; the inscription was carved by ancient Jews who somehow made it to New Mexico.But when the author starts getting into the supposed ""eclipse"" rock art (he gives two different dates for the eclipse) and then goes off into the stratosphere with all the alleged Hebrew influence, it doesn't make any sense. I can't follow his muddled illogic. Also, the sources used for reference seem to be mostly rather old for a book originally published in 1984."
1,Not helpful at all!,"I haven't completely finished reading this book yet, but it has not been helpful at all! It is so boring that I am skipping around alot. And the advice so far is horrible. For example, one of the authors was talking about ""Road Rage"" and talked about things that alot of people do and that he has done. But instead of giving you advice on how to deal with it, he just tells you not to do it. This is the most boring book that I have ever read! And I look forward to skipping ahead until it's over and I can get a better book!"
2,Nothing New and Rather Over-priced,"I bought this directly from the author's website in the spring. He really says nothing new. Basically he just rehashes what you could readily find in a three or four used business books at $10 a pop instead of $227, plus shipping and handling.Bob is a nice man and he means well but this course comes across like a student book report. Bob even keeps boasting that this course stems from his having read over a thousand books."
4,Move Over boys there's a new MAN in town!!,"In a music industry that is overrun with boy bands, Chris Emerson brings to the table a fresh sound that we adults can listen to. As I listened to the album for the first time, it was like being in a new relationship. I was excited, but apprehensive. Noticeable were the Motown and Classic Rock influences and even a touch of Techno. From the soft and gentle (""All Because of You""), to the ... sultry (""This Could Take All Night""), to the [great] Rock-N-Roll (""Fly Away""), there's a little something for everyone on this album. As I listened to the album for the 100th time I realized that I'm in this relationship to stay! If you're ready for something new and exciting and fresh, then ""Tourist"" is for you. BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!"
2,Guadalcanal,"Edwin Hoyt has written a nice book about the Battle of Guadalcanal. However it is lacking details and skips key periods of time during the confict there in the south Pacific. I would recommend this book for a person is looking to get a basic understanding of the battle there. If a reader is looking for a indepth analysis, I would instead recommend Guadalcanal by Richard Frank."
1,not what it used to be,"I had used Fran Wilson lipsticks in the past so when I found these again - I was very excited; once received the excitement ended. The product and the case itself were not of the quality it once was. I was very glad that I paid so minimally for this and the other Fran Wilson lipsticks that I purchased. After the first time I tried these, I threw the out."
5,Sparkling Mood lipsticks,Wonderful products!!! Arrived fast in excellent condition and is exactly what I was hoping for!!
5,Inspiring!,"A pleasure to use: great heat distribution, nice looks and it cleans easily. It's actually inspiring better food! A piece of advice, though. Handle it almost with the care you would use on non-stick surfaces, and it will reward you with easy-cleaning interior for years (mine is 2-years old, and heavily used). Scratch the coating on top of the enamel and food will start to stick to it, even though the scratches won't be visible. If food seems stuck to the surface (after a good roast in the oven), let it soak a bit and stuff comes out. Just don't try scrubbing it too hard. Another tidbit: the upper lip is not coated (the cast iron is exposed), and it may show rust if left wet for too long. Season that edge with a bit of oil, as with any other cast iron pan, and this won;t be a problem anymore. Or simply make it a habit of drying it quickly after use."
5,Another winner from Schecter,"Schecter continues to impress with the quality of their instruments and highly competitive pricing. The Stiletto Custom-5 is no exception. The online pictures really do it justice but fail to show the gorgeous wood grain. The added gold-tone hardware kicks this bass into aesthetic bliss. The sound and play is no less pleasing. The pickups deliver clean powerful tones from smooth to growling. The satin finished neck is silky smooth with an out-of-box setup that required only a quick tuning. The body design flows with contoured slopes to keep it comfortable for extended play. I pair this with theTC Electronic BG250 1x15"" Bass Combo Amplifierand could not be happier.

1,Read this 1st if you plan to purchase!,"The make sure this item fits your vehicle option on the site is inaccurate. I purchased for a 2007 Chrysler Sebring (which the site said that it would fit on.) Needless to say, it did not. The manual that comes with the intake states that it fits on the following vehicles:*2000-2004 Mitsubishi Eclipse V6*2001-2004 Chrysler Sebring Coupe LXI*2001-2004 Dodge Stratus Coupe R/T"
4,Excellent!,"I purchased Nature's Way milk thistle based on reviews. So far, i haven't noticed or felt any different but everything i have read about milk thistle suggests that it has excellent benefits."
4,Indian Doll,My 4 yr. old grandaughter is very interested in Indians and their ways so that is why I ordered the doll for her birthday.
1,"Bad quality, broken and description not aquarate","I bought this item because of the description and because I also trust in the store.The table was broken(under the table the plastic that hold the table together was broken), plastic is cheap and bad quality, the description is not aquarate, is impossible it will hold 200lb.The plastic is so bad that when you open the table it seams like it will collapse right there!You can think that it will be a good size, but it is small.I do not recommend this table, even if is in sale!I sent it back for a full refund and the shipping was $17.xx, wich I'll not see again!"
2,political agenda?,"While it is not a bad text, it doesn't mention much of the research done on the topic of infanticide that demonstrates that most of those who commit neonaticide are mentally competent. Read ""Why Mothers Kill"" if you're looking for more psychologically sound text."
4,If you own The Shakespeare Book of Lists you already have this book!,"This is a great book, but you should know that, as far as I can tell, it is EXACTLY the same as Lomonico's The Shakespeare Book of Lists published by New Page Books the same year as this title. I don't know why neither of the listings here indicate this, but it's true. Don't buy it twice!"
4,Performance Based Shakespeare,This title is very helpful for teachers who want to encourage more performance-based Shakespeare in their high school English classes. Activities suggested are fun and should encourage kids to become more involved with Shakespeare.
2,way over rated,"I bought this book hoping that it would be useful in my Shakespeare classes. The reviews sounded good, so I went for it. It was a waste of my money. All of the information in here is trivial and not of much use at all. I can't think of a good thing to say about this book other than I hope I can sell it at the used book store."
4,very nice cassette,i came across this cassette in a record brand new can you believe that since this has been out of print since the late 80s my favorite is hey good lookin and i remember fries with that shake back in 1986 was there a video for hey good lookin
3,lots of singing and dancing,"I love musicals, but this one went a little overboard and I never finished watching it. Betty Hutton and Eddie Bracken are two of my favorites, but this one was missing something."
2,Weekend toy,"Ok from description i didn't realize it required water to be pressurized to give the car boost. By weekend car was worthless. A tiny nick in chamber (from being used outside cause this is an OUTDOORS toy only, unless you wanna wet mess everywhere) the car was rendered useless, because it will no longer pressurize."
3,"Star Wars Old School, Baby!","This toys are awesome and if you're a STAR WARS fan you can't do without them, period!The best thing about these toys is that they have real fabric clothing like the old toys, and come in the vintage packaging, which will take old school fans back in time to great memories. The outer package is also a great idea because it helps keep it safe as a collector's item. The detail on the figures is amazing, so overall a great item."
1,Blue Malva Conditioner,"After using, my hair was dull & dry feeling. This, along with the shampoo, turned my hair an actual dark gray color. That is not what I was looking for. I wanted the white hair to show - just wanted it highlighted & smooth looking."
5,Loveeeeeeee it!,"This conditioner has been a staple in my shower for years!!!! I color my hair a lot and being really blonde, my hair always wants to get brassy. This conditioner works wonders, making my hair brass-free, locking in the color and making it soft and healthy. And you gotta love the aveda smell, so invigorating!"
3,An Ok Doll,"I am a huge fan of Corpse Bride.......there are many good dolls out there. But this one is just.....ok. Dont get me wrong its a beautiful doll. With her unique decorated gown, and her sweet expression and all,though, I feel I need to point out some things that need to be fixed. If they are making any more of this which I'm sure of, here are the things they need to improve; I personally think they should color her hair and skin an actual blue. I mean, her hair is purple and her skin is green! And if I may ask, could they give her a longer and thicker dress? Other than that,I have no more complaints. Just hope they fix those problems!"
2,Very Delicate,"I purchased the Corpse Bride 12"" doll and the Victor 12"" doll for my daughter who is five and loves the movie. She went crazy for the dolls when she got them. I have to say they are well done in the way they replicated the characters in the movie. However, they are very delicate and really cannot withstand child play. These dolls are for looks only. Within a week of purchase my daughter, who has never broken a toy broke the head off the bride and a hand off Victor in the same day. Repairs with superglue and a glue gun could not repair it. She was heart broken."
2,Great to look at but....,"I bought this doll for both my daughters who are HUGE fans of both Burton movies. It broke within hours. Both heads snapped off at the middle of the neck. I had to give one of the Brides hip surgery as the pin in the top of her leg fell out. After rigging that together, the head snapped off. We had similar problems with Victor, his legs snapp off at the knees. If you just want to look at the doll this would be great as she is beautifully detailed and very COOL. However, shes just not very sturdy."
5,Nice,This figurine is good quality. My 6 year old daughter loves it. She loved the movie and wanted the figurines for her birthday.
5,Beautiful Display Doll,"This doll is very beautiful , but does need a regular doll stand to stay on the shelf safely. I cannot imagine letting a child play with this , it is fragile. Very nicely done,really an amazing work for the price, but not for children."
4,JOHN BARRY IS SLIPPING.,"This soundtrack doesn't really have a James Bond feel to it. The title song sung by: SHIRLEY BASSEY is great, and track 2 is a great sneaky track, but tracks like 3,4, and 11 get kind of boring. I don't think that we need 2 instrumentals of Diamonds Are Forever. 1 would have been enough. Tracks 6,7, and 9 are very mellow and don't exactly have the James Bond taste to them. Ones like 10 and 12 are excitng though. This is a pretty good soundtrack except for a few flaws. If you want calm and mellow James Bond music, then get this soundtrack."
3,Disappointments are Forever...,"At one time my favorate film, until I grew up and realised Connery was too large and bored to play Bond any more. But I still loved the space music ('007 and Counting') and was dying to hear it again. But after buying it I was disappointed so much from the film didn't make it onto the CD. Where is all the fight music? The opening scene music? The scuffle in the plastic surgeon's cave? The lift battle with Peter Franks? Still, it's very original and the sassy saxophones (particularly in 'Bond Smells a Rat') give the CD a ritzy Las Vagas feel to it that's unique to this Bond soundtrack."
5,The quintessential bond album,Although this album does lack some of the better moments in the film the music still stands alone from anything else and although not being the perfect representation of the film the music is so typically bond you have to love it. Out of the many films barry scored Diamonds are forever has the most characteristic and enjoyable no-nonsense music in any of the bond series
4,Nice saw but perhaps lacking power for heavy duty use,"I like this saw and I got mine on sale for a nice price. It is not a replacement for a heavy duty professional worm drive saw. It is well balanced and has a cute color scheme but the truth is it is just OK and makes a good garage saw and homeowner use tool. Compared to other consumer grade saws it is their equal or better. Compared to professional grade such as Milwaukee or Bosch just not quite there. If you need professional grade add a few more dollars and get something with a little more attitude. I like the saw and will use it for light jobs as an all around saw but if I need to cut heavier materials I will use the table saw, miter saw, or a worm drive saw."
3,strange saw bad view,"-very awkward to use-visibility of cut line is poor-quiet-seems to have enough power-the shoe is not straight if you are planing on using a guide as i do i would have not bought this saw as i use it to cut large panels for cabinet installs-reviewed by popular mechanics as the worst saw in the review all they tell you say is that it was in the test-case is hard to close and fit everything back in-previous saws were hitachi and makita-might have been better if this was my first saw so i could get used tothe ""fluid feel""i have been a circular saw for 10 years professionally"
5,Best business book of the year!,"This well written book is a facinating review of a very intelligent man that made some poor decisions early in his career and spent most of his life redeeming himself to the public and his friends. It is wonderful to read about his ultimate success in overcoming the adversity of the press, the legal system and the cutthroat Wall Street environment. The book illustrates that it is possible to have been in jail and to be financially successful and respected by family and business associates alike in the end.The author did a excellent job of researching the material that has resulted in a very factual, objective narrative... but it still reads like a novel!I would strongly recommend purchasing this book, particularly if you are a business leader that must make people judgements."
5,This is a great product. Alot of the spas use it.,"I have always taken good care of my skin.I started when I was 19. I am now 47. I was just starting to get the fine lines around my eyes, and a freind of mine recommended Squalene to me. I saw a dramatic difference the first week. I use it under my moisturizer as I have very dry skin. It's not grease and it just takes a small amount.I don't believe anyone who tried this product would be disappointed.Leigh, Washington State"
5,"The ""Real"" squalane from the Sea!","I just LOVE this wonderful healing oil, and its the real deal the one that is made from sharks liver oil, not the squalane that comes from OLIVES!!!It is so quickly absorbed too.... soothing comforting oil from the Sea!!! Such a lovely skin soother!"
5,Great Stuff,This is great stuff and have been using it for several years now. my skin is very dry and using this plus regular moisturizer has helped my skin dramticly.
2,STICKS OUT TOO FAR,"Box received fairly beat up with some minor scratches, nothing some touch up paint won't fix.The real problem for me is that the entire assembly sticks out 3-4""+ past the bumper on my 05 Highlander. After doing more research, I've found there are other hitches that have a curved outer assembly that will limit the amount of the hitch that sticks out past the bumper. This one looks bad to me because of the design, even my kids thought it was excessive.If you don't care about that, the holes lined up perfectly and it was easy to install. But for me it was a deal breaker and I will have to pay return shipping."
4,Easy Install,Product installed easily into 6 existing holes; Co sent additional parts that were missing; no problems.
1,the hitch that didn't fit,"Just got a Valley model #81310, for my 2007 Lexus RX350. Unfortunately the bolt holes do not align. Waiting for their response.Hitch - Valley 81310 Hitch"
4,Shelf only,"This is a quality shelf bracket, but unlike the picture shown, it only comes with the shelf bars, not the back railing. I had to juryrig an extention bracket together to have something to mount it to. But now that its in place I really like it. It is strong, fully adjustable and easily removable (when necessary)."
4,Not bad,"The feet don't sit square on the ground and it isn't as sturdy as I would have expected. Overall it's still a strong, heavy duty stand."
1,Too Heavy Hammock Stand,The Hatteras Arc Tri-Beam Steel Hammock Stand arrived in a battered 6 foot corrugated shipper delivered by UPS. It weighs 100+ lbs and is too heavy for one person to move and assemble. The center beam has a flawed seam and does not slide into the end beam. I have contacted customer service twice without resolution and am not satisfied with the tri-beam steel hammock stand nor the manufacturer's customer service.
1,Wrong hardware--not helpful,"I received the stand today. When i went to put it together, the bolts and nuts don't fit. I called customer service--he knew immediately what the problem was --the nut is the wrong size-- because they've had this problem in the past. Which begs the question: and so why is there still a problem? He offered to mail out new hardware, but that would take days, so i said i would go to the hardware store to get the right nut. I asked him what size i should get--he had no idea. Seriously?For over $200, i expect the right hardware."
1,Pieces don't fit together,"Ordered this for father's day. Husband just spent a half hour trying to fit the two end pieces to the center piece. Supposed to slot the center piece, which narrows down at the tube ends, into the end tubes. They simply will not fit. Husband says there is a metal bead the isn't filed down on the inside of each of the end tubes. Thinks this may be resulting in the end not fitting on. Very frustrating. We tried together to no avail. Pieces simply won't fit together.[updating review] - spoke to customer service today, they were surprised and apologetic. They are having fedex come and pick up the stand, will inspect and get a new stand back to us. Says it should be easy. That said, I'm not sure how long this will all take. Fingers crossed. My husband is REALLY looking forward to using this!"
2,We had to send it back!,"We had to send it back. Way bigger then we tought. Waaay bigger! We measured the room first but either made a measurement mistake or the arc is bigger then advertised. Also, it was very flimsy. The hammock we have was touching the ground. Didn't work! :("
2,This product came without hardware,This product has no quality and came with no hardware. I do not recommend this product.The company needs to have more quality in packaging.
1,"Bad Girl, Mal!","If you were going to help ms hayes, they why did you have to give her a nasty note, Mal. You were supposed to be her number one fan!"
4,They are Large and LOUD,"Sound great, they need to be powered by more power than most home stereoreceivers have. I recomend a solid 250 rms to make them sing. A standard 100-110 rms receiver will not do these speakers justice."
4,these speakers rock,"i am so far impressed with these speakers. however they need alot of power so i hooked up two identical harmon kardon recievers with each reciever pushing out 120 watts per channel.so basically i have 240 watts going to each tower speaker. the cerwin vega users manual explains how to wire the speakers this way, it is very simple. i am not kidding when i say this, the combination i am running right now rivals night club systems. it is way more sound that i will ever need in the bottom 3rd story of my house wich has about 1100 square feet of pool table, bar and game room space. these speakers are very heavy."
3,Sequels are never as good.,"Chickenhawk this aint, but still told in Mr Mason's readable style & covers his numerous adventures after leaving Vietnam.The first half will involve you as much as Chickenhawk - the only thing that brings this book down is that the (SPOILER ALERT) entire last 3rd is set in prison, and after a few chapters of the hum-drum prison routine it get's a bit slow & upsets the pace of the book. If last 3rd had been condensed into 2 or 3 chapters the book would've been better over-all & would've won 4 stars from me.In a nutshell, worth the read, but last 3rd gets bogged down.For anyone interested in writing and/or how he came about writing Chickenhawk, it is very interesting reading as he tells us all about this process."
2,"""Terra Cotta Colored"" Plastic","I was disappointed when I opened the package and found small lightweight plastic items. I first thought I had received the wrong order, but after examining the package I realized it was simply an unexpected product. The toes are very thin and lightweight but I was able to stack several together to achieve a functional set of pot feet. I will not order again."
4,Great book helping on gasping the mathematical apparatus in QM,"Enjoyed the book while crossreading other QM books. Nice mathematical introduction.Especially a good chapter on measurement, finite, infinite Hilbert Space, unbound and bound operators"
2,get another book!,"Unfortunately, I had to use this book for a whole year. This book just plain stinks! The author is long winded and waste alot of space doing trivial things. Often, he leaves the more important topics as homework exercises. The explanations he does give are so confusing you'll have to read another book just to know what's going on. If you want a good Quantum Mechanics book, I suggest Sakurai."
1,phoney as a 3 dollar bill,"Why did I even buy this book? I wish I had not since I found it full of misleading assumptions and misdirection. why would this person call herself a Christian Minister if she does not even know the basics of the Bible? Nothing worked in this book for me. I found myself wondering why I even bothered to buy it. A near death experience without a death in the very begining of the book was pretty silly. Linking near death experiences to Christianity was also a low point for me. How could this writer sleep at night? I would have to say there are people out there that would write ""anything"" for money. This one belongs at the very bottom of my list."
1,can't recommend this to anyone,"Near death experiences and Christianity DO NOT mix!!!!!!I believe that most NDEs are fabricated, written to cash in on the book market. It only misleads the already lost people who believe this sort of stuff. Unfortunately for the lost souls that read this book, they are not reading the truth, just made up and embellished stories for profit."
1,Boring writer! Ego came through. Very big ego.,"What a waste of money. Not only does this writer write bad but its pretty much a cult. Bible does say that ANYONE who adds to the Bible or takes away from it will be given a curse. Also, can't have a near death experience book written about a well respected and very strict Christian religion by adding to the Bible. Christians don't do that so the writer is pretty much a liar, not a Christian nor a Minister. What is this writer thinking??? Perhaps NOT! I could see the writer has a huge ego and it was pretty much annoying. Wish I could have my money back!"
2,Didn't work for me. My dogs won't go near it!,"I honestly cannot say how well this product would work to clean teeth and reduce bad breath, so I am basing my review on other factors. First and foremost, my two dogs (Yorkie/Papillon and Havanese) had no interest in even trying these biscuits so they may not be very palatable for dogs. The product and the packaging also do not appear to be of very high quality. I would recommend trying other means to clean your dog's teeth such as the C.E.T. dental chews which worked particularly well for my dogs."
1,Dirty Little Trick!!!!!!,"The authors call these secrets, but it is mostly trivia that was never really a secret. This is a fine trivia book and a good read in that respect, but it is certainly not scholarly research or a revelation of ""secrets"". One reviewer commented on Mr. Nofi's comments about the so called ""New York bomber"" and how on a discussion group he claimed it was actually not proved. A book that reveals ""secrets"" must be based on primary research, yet this book has no bibilography and Mr. Nofi indicates they used mainly secondary material while he has been critical of others who do the same, ie. Green's Luftwaffe books. This book should be called TRIVIA & RUMORS of WWII, but the title is really a ""DIrty Little Trick"" to get the buyer interested in something that the book has little of - ""secrets"". Still, I agree it is a good read for the trivia buff. --H. Zarska"
2,No real secrets in this book,"There aren't real secrets revealed in this book. It is more a compliation of bits and pieces of information that have been known for quite awhile in most cases. When something different does come up, such as the assertion that the New Guinea campaign was more decisive in the Pacific than the Guadalcanal campaign, there is no discussion or support of the position given, simply assertion. The authors also can't seem to agree with themselves. On page 300, they state that submarines accounted for over half the Japanese ships sunk. Nine pages later they state that submarines sank 45% of the Japanese ships sunk during the war. Probably the discrepancy is due to ships vs. tonnage, but it is not so stated. For the serious reader of WWII history, this volume is a disappointment."
3,More trivia than secrets,"This book is best suited for the history buff, as it contains pages (and pages, and pages, and pages) of world war 2 trivia. Unfortunately, the so called ""Dirty Little Secrets"" are few and far between. The lay reader will lose interest as the signal-to-noise ratio for the non-afficianado is just too low."
2,Easy to put down,"Some interesting stories and concepts throughout the book, but relatively boring. I was ready to be done with this one at the half way point."
4,To be used for browsing and eyebrow raising,"What is this thing called war ? It is such a shocking, but also such a normal, such a human thing that it penetrates history and literature books alike. This book is not a description of parts of the war, such as "" Touched with fire"" by Eric Bergerud ( about Gualdalcanal and New Guinea) nor a study about political motives leading to war. This book is more like an almanac, giving information about the war that is less known but in a dry, almost tongue in cheek way. It is an absolute must for every one who wants to read about WW II."
3,Not Much Substance,My children found Max and Ruby through the television programme rather than the book. Given that they love Max and Ruby and love books I thought this was a no-brainer. I was therefore very disappointed in the amount of substance to this book. It is very much a board book with very little narrative. I am sure that it would be great for very young children but at 2.5 years there is not enough to keep their interest.
4,My 2-year-old loves it,"My 2-year-old son loves Max & Ruby and asks to watch the show most evenings before bed. I decided to get him a Max & Ruby book, thinking he'd love that too. I was right! He asked for this book every night before bed for the first 2 weeks we had it and now, after a couple months, it's still one he reaches for often. I only give it 4 stars, because I feel it could have been a little longer. Any child who watches the show has a long enough attention span for a few more pages, and I think that would have made this book perfect."
4,"Cute, but not necessarily a bedtime book!","Doggone if Ruby doesn't try hard to help Max get to sleep, but nothing seems to work! Keep an eye out for the red rubber elephant in each picture.Not my child's favorite Max book (he prefers ""Max's New Suit""), but good to break up the routine once in a while."
2,This is a Board Book Not a Hardcover,"I was very disappointed in the description of this book provided by Amazon. It is touted as a Hardcover Book on the website, but when it arrived, it was a board book. My daugher loves Ruby & Max, but I try to get the hardcover editions as they are a little meatier. This one is below her level."
1,Will NEVER Buy This Again,"I Purchased this to go along with some of their other products that I bought, and also, based on the product brand reviews. This shampoo dried my hair out and it begin shedding! If your going to buy this I would definitely recommend IMMEDIATELY deep conditioning afterwards. I will never buy this again!"
1,Melted,"In the past I have had good luck with OXO products, but this is not the case with the Black Nylon Flexible Omelet Turner. This item has a strange downward bend in the middle that tips the end down so much that that a fried egg will not stay on the turner and falls back into the pan. The turner is so large that it is hard to use in a 10"" pan. This item is supposed to be rated 400 degrees it melted turning hash browns. This is a disappointing purchase and not up to OXO standards."
2,Disappointed,"Generally I love the OXO Good Grips products, but this one is bulky and the blade has a strange bend in the middle, making it about impossible to use in an 8"" omelet pan - and barely usable in a 10"" pan.On the plus side, it works well on the griddle for pancakes and French toast... but that isn't what I purchased this for, so I'm disappointed."
2,guess the illustartor?,"Though not as bad as the books with illustrations exerpted from the movie, this book is illustrated in the STYLE of H.A. Rey, by Vipah Interactive. Somehow, somewhere these books have lost the charm of the originals. I would have liked to know this before buying them. My kids still like them; I am horrified."
2,Scanned version of the original,The Kindle version is just a scanned version of the original paper version. I would expect to at see sharper graphics and better integrated text. It's readable and my son enjoys it but overall a disappointing product.
2,not very good for kindle,the story is great but the text is actually an image rather than real text. it is very small. you cannot adjust the font because the text is just part of the illustration. they cut corners with this one. curious george at the beach is done the way it should be.
2,"Typical Curious George, but bad formatting for iphone app","This is as good as any CG book, but I wish the text was formatted differently. When reading it with Kindle for iphone, the text is very, very small. The pages seem to be formatted as pictures instead of text with picture, so enlarging the font has no effect. When you zoom in to enlarge the text, it treats the page as a picture and opens a new window that has to be closed before you can go to the next page. Makes reading very tedious."
4,Fun little book,"Not the most exciting/fun to read for an adult (over and over), but for a toddler who loves curious george, it's a good addition (at a great price) to a growing book collection!"
2,Not Original Hits,"I was so looking forward to receiving this CD as I could not find any Eden Kane CD's in Australia. I have an EP of Eden but wanted some of those great hits on CD. Sadly these are not the original recordings - ""Boys Cry"" is a real disappointment and ""Well I Ask You"" just does not get anywhere near the original. This album is not recommended if you like to hear the songs as you originally remember them on the radio.Well I ask you! Where are the originals?"
2,All Wine Is Good?,"What's good about this book is that a lot of the wines in it are in stores so you can compare the book to what you are about to purchase. What doesn't work is that every wine seems to be considered good to excellent. Any everyday wine drinker knows that even the most popular wines are not ALL good. Yes, wine is a matter of personal taste, but would you really trust Consumer Reports, or some magazine like it, if it told you that the majority of the most popular consumer goods are worth the amount of money that you blindly spend? Just checking."
2,Can't Catch My Breath,Way too busy and confusing. Went to her website and it's no longer in existence. What's that all about?
4,The Trinity and its Applications,"A brief yet pithy book regarding the doctrine of the trinity and its application. Not an exhaustive scholarly treatment, but a very good exposition that avoids simplistic explanations."
4,Good for Sunday School,"It's easy for theology wonks to critique this book for not engaging all the thorny issues, but that's not its intention. I have some problems with his conclusions, but this really is a helpful book to give Old Aunt Gladys at church.He notes how the persons of the Trinity *subsist* in the essence. He's drawing upon Boethius' work and I think that is problematic, but it is a good start, at least. He follows the standard line in apologetics by noting how all the persons are divine, yet there is one God; yet each person is not the other. Etc., etc. Again, this formulation, if taken too seriously, will lead to problems down the road (e.g., relations of opposition stuff); however, it really is a good way to get the conversation going.Conclusion:This is probably the best take on the Trinity as it relates to ""Sunday School"" teaching."
5,This thing is awesome,"Almost everything you need to be a professional window cleaner is at Home Depot, except for this bad boy. This makes cleaning windows soo easy."
5,lo mejor de lo mejor en este tipo de musica.,"este ha sido el mejor cd de musica rap que trae musica del mero monterrey, y tambien incluye relatos e historias de la ciudad de monterrey, que pueden ser vistos en una computadora. este cd es de lo mejor."
2,EH!,"Other the ""Looking for an Echo"", didn't really care for this CD. I've seen him and his group on Doo Wop and loved the songs he sang, but didn't care for these tunes. I just play this for Echo."
4,A forgotten CCM classic,"Frustrated by the seeming inability of Christian artists being able to cross over onto the secular pop charts, while secular artists had hits with Christian songs, Larry Norman recorded a collection of cover tunes of those hits in a satirical style. It is both humorous and musically entertaining. The set starts off with an outstanding acoustic version of ""Spirit in the Sky"". He does a pretty good imitation of Mick Jagger covering the Stones' ""Shine A Light"", along with pretty good versions of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", ""Let It Be"" and ""My Sweet Lord"". All-in-all this is a very strong album from the Godfather of Contemporary Christian Music. If he had approached this project a little more seriously, he might have had a pop hit.It is a shame that this album is out of print."
2,Wouldn't focus.,"Could not get this telescope to focus. Sent it back, company agreed. I bought a different telescope. This one is very cool looking. I wishe it had been better quality. Made in China."
5,Love it!,"Great product and well packaged. It took me about 20 minutes to set up and looks so cute! The only problem is that it does need some caulking between the seams if left outside. Overall, a great product!"
2,Cat house not so sturdy,"This was for a small framed cat. The house isn't really sturdy, but has nice appearance. I saw it on other sites for $150.00. So I am glad I found it for half the price because really it is not the quality one might think for the $150.00 price."
2,Too small for a cat,"Looks great, but even for a cat it is too small. Construction is good, but not as weather proof as one would expect for an outdoor house."
2,Too dark,"As cute as this dog house is, our pups wouldn't go inside it. It is deep and dark with a very small opening. It really needs to have a larger opening or windows. The first step broke under my daughter's foot, which I think should've been able to handle the 40 lbs that she is. So the materials are not necessarily the best quality for the money spent. All in all, not good for our dogs."
3,Cute but useless for many dogs,"The stair are tiny and steep and scare 4 out of my 5 Chihuahuas/ only one goes up.They look good but were not made with dogs in mind. 2 steps, but much bigger, would have been more inviting to less secure dogs."
4,Great for a small indoor dog,"This is a great product-but one thing that needs to be taken into consideration it's built for a light dog. I have a 9 lb maltee poo and he sleeps on the top of the dog house. Unfortunately, I had this next to our bed and I stepped on the last step-it broke off, hence the heads up that this is not ment for heavy dogs. This isn't sturdy thick real wood, consider it compressed wood. But looking at all the options, I wanted something that we can put in our master bedroom and get the dog off our bed-he loves it. It's pleasing to the eyes and for the price it's definitely worth it."
2,needs better instructions,"I would have given this 4 stars but he instructions were not very good to show how to put together. If you want to buy it the side panels have the extra peice of wood on the bottom(to hold floor). THe size is decieving but good for a small pet(cat or dog). I love the cedar smell.All in all once together it is a decent product, but it needs better instructions or a You tube to show how to put it together."
2,Terrible quality.,I bought this from Sabrina Silver. It was terrible quality. Looked like it had been cut out with a band saw. And they sent me a size that wouldn't fit. I tried all my fingers to no avail. I won't be buying from these folks again.
3,classic obituary sound.,"close to 20 years ago i started listening to obituary,now this band comes along.this is one hell of a release that has that classic obituary sound.the songs from this album just get stuck in your head.a must for old school death metal fans."
5,Excellent,"If you are a fan of Obituary, this is a must have.Great production and Trevor Perez sounds great as usual."
4,Some sick punchlines!,"At last Copywrite, a talented MC from Columbus and member of the supergroup the Weatherman drops his first solo-effort. Circulating through the underground for a while on tracks by the Smud Peddlers, Cage and his click Mhz delivered this guy a reputation on dropping ill oneliners and that's what he does on this album. There's too many to mention but ""I leave you in the middle of nowhere like the letter H"" is just a fly example. Productionwise the album is on point with productions from Mighty Mi, RJD2 and Copywrite himself and guestappearances from Jakki the Motamouth and Camu Tao complete the cipher. Buy this album if you like battleraps from a higher caliber."
4,One of the best punchline rappers ever....,"...But not much else. Seriously if all you look for in an album is totally ill punchlines and hardcore battle raps this will be one of your favourite albums ever. but if you like more variety it is not for you.Copywrite also has a pretty sick flow, packed with agression and on one song reaches triple-cadance speed combined with a compound rhyme scheme he is no doubt an ill MC, if a bit limited."
5,"Dr.Azeem Alam Khan.M.B.B.S(QAU),M.Sc(UK),FACP(USA).","I read this book last week and find it quite informative and interesting.Skin Photographs are clear,excellent and professional.Only important diseases are focused,some pictures are really rare and Mr.Robertson deserves full credit.I recommend this book to all medical students,dermatologists and people related to medical profession!"
1,Worst,"I have used many many spreaders and this is the worst. You can't open/adjust the regulator/opener unless you get off the atv and walk around back. Technically you can open it but, you can't see what setting you are at from the atv. I can't speak harshly enough about that. Tried spreading 3 different products and all were of different sizes and I couldn't get this thing to spread wider than 5ft diameter. Not good. While spreading most of the spread was focused in the center; about 2ft diameter. It was pouring very heavy in that area and very thin beyond that. Even spread is very important and this spreader doesn't have it. The only good things are it looks very pretty and it seems to be built sturdy. But, those to things mean nothing considering the aforementioned."
1,Stupid Butt-kicking Barbie!,"Barbie came to my house and kicked me in the face, and gagged me with her ballerina shoes. KILL IT DADDY!"
2,Don't Buy - Buyer BEWWARE!,"Within 3 1/2 months after ordering, all 8 coils failed to send the accurate voltage signal to the ECM. Even though the car seemingly ran okay with the coils installed, the faulty signal caused the Check Engine Light to come on, which prevented me from getting my car inspected. I have a 2001 Q45 Infiniti. I called the manufacturer, but haven't heard back from them.Buyer Beware... It may cost a bit more, but I am now repurchasing OEM coils."
5,Lucio Fulcis Best Film,"If you're new to Lucio Fulci films, look no further, watch The Beyond (aka Seven Doors of Death). The Beyond is a very original atmospheric zombie/haunted house Italian horror film set in New Orleans. The effects are gruesome and insane and the storyline is cool.What a lot of people overlook is the often amazing cinematogrophy of the film. There are long Kubrickian shots, intense Sergio Leone style shots and the lighting/colors look like a Dario Argento film (intense blue, red shots).If you are a fan of old school gory horror flicks you HAVE to get this movie.If you enjoy The Beyond I strongly also reccomend checking out Zombie (aka Zombi 2) and City of The Living Dead (aka The Gates of Hell).And if you're new to Italian horror you definately want to watch some old Dario Argento films such as Suspiria, Deep Red, Inferno, Bird With the Crystal Plumage, and Demons (Argento didnt direct demons, only wrote and produced it, but its definately worth checking out)"
3,Enjoyable but overrated,"After hearing about ""The Beyond"" for years and then finally watching it, I didn't find that the film quite lives up to its notorious reputation. The various scenes were not particularly shocking, aside from one episode involving some carnivorous spiders. As I summarized the movie to my wife: ""Italian horror at its least subtle."" But the film is not without interest, despite its wayward plotting. I was intrigued to notice the inclusion of the book called ""Eibon"", clearly a nod to Clark Ashton Smith's ""Book of Eibon"", although there were no other specific Cthulhu Mythos references in the movie."
2,I can't understand all the hype,"This movie could easily be a *1/2, not a full **. I watched it last night, and other than a fairly good beginning, and a creepy end, the movie was not enjoyable. I fast forwarded through most of it, and if you read the other single and double star reviews, i agree with all of their arguments. Low budget gore just for the sake of it, with mostly poor acting, and plot holes large enough to drive a truck through. I actually like the idea of what COULD have happened with the vagueness, the subtle magic, but such details were lost by the director. If this is the BEST they have to offer, i consider myself lucky for never having seen the others.I guess i just like my horror with a little more wit, and this will be the last fulci film i ever watch."
2,About What You'd Expect,"The Beyond is about what one would expect from director Lucio Fulci. Some graphic violence and gore throughout. Personally, I didn't find the story line that entertaining. I collect films but I chose to sell this one after one viewing. If you have seen Fulci's film ""Zombie,"" sometimes referred to as Zombie 2, and you enjoyed it, then you will probably enjoy ""The Beyond"" as well. If you did not enjoy Zombie, then I can't recommend The Beyond. They seem very similar films to me. I didn't keep Zombie in my collection either."
2,Gore,"Classic horror plot, but once I managed to watch this entire film...years ago when I bought this. But now I cannot even keep my attention on it to complete the entire film. It's just one scene set up to get to the next scene of pointless gore, wax people melting, eyes being gouged or eaten by spiders, zombies whatever...just a exploration into cheap gore film exploitation. I suppose if you are in the right mood for just some weird gross out film then this might work."
5,Why you watch horror movies!,"When I watch horror movies that let me down I think ""Why can't it be like THE BEYOND?""A scary,gory,visually eerie spookshow that entertains me completely.Sure,horror fans will probably mentally note where certain aspects of the plot likely derived from,but SO WHAT!This is a masterpiece in the Italian gorror genre.The dvd looks and sounds fantastic and has neat extras."
2,"If you like eyeballs and hair, this movie is for you!","Quite the hoaky little low budget flick. Not much thought is given to plot, characterization and storyline; and the wretched 80's synthesizer music doesn't help much.Lots of hair and eyeballs, as well as other gruesome other gagglies. This is not a movie to watch to be entertained. If you like bad horror effects, overly hairy guys who turn into zombies, and makeup that looks like dried oatmeal this movie is for you."
4,Stylish yet uneven film at an affordable price.,"...As a lover of certian genres such as italian horror, this is merely an average film. It's way too uneven.. It's starts off with a bang with a heinous murder of a cultist.. then loses focus.. the horror scenes are too far apart, untill the end in the hospital when its a zombie attack. Then the very end makes no sense, typical italian film. On the plus side the cinematography is good, Fulci uses great shots and focus tricks. Some of the special effects aren't bad either, such as the first eye gouging or the nails through the wrists. Others such as the spider scene are a mixed bag. All in all, for the money its a good movie to have on hand to play in the background of your Halloween party, or when you have a BAD movie party. Enjoy!Note: Rating would be 3 stars except the price and transfer are so good I give it 4."
1,WAS I AMONG THE FEW THAT WATCHED THIS..I THOUGHT IT REEKED!!,"SOONER OR LATER I'LL BECOME AN ITALIAN HORROR HATER. LITTLE CAN PREPARE ONE FOR SUCH GARBAGE. I LOVE HORROR, HOWEVER I DON'T LOVE THIS. THE REAL HORROR IS HOW POORLY THIS WAS MADE. AND HOW I WASTED MY HARD EARNED MONEY & VALUABLE TIME ON THIS. IF YOUR ANYTHING LIKE ME YOU MAY LIKE TO TAKE CHANCES ON MOVIES THAT APPEAR TO BE WORTHY. YOU THINK ""HOW BAD COULD IT BE?"", ""AM I MISSING OUT BY NOT GIVING THIS MOVIE A GO?"".. I DO THIS ALOT, & ALOT OF THE TIME I FEEL GOOD ABOUT MY PURCHASE AND I ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION WITH PRIDE. WELL FOLKS THIS ONE WAS NOT ADDED TO MY LIBRARY. INSTEAD I PARTED WITH IT AND FELT A LITTLE GUILTY, CUZ SOMEONE ELSE MAY SPEND THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY ON IT, FOLLOWED BY THEIR VALUABLE TIME. I HOPE IT WASN'T YOU. IF YOU COME ACROSS A MOVIE CALLED ""THE SEVEN DOORS TO DEATH"" AVOID IT, IT'S THE SAME MOVIE WITH A DIFFERENT NAME."
1,Sadistic imbecille exercise,"Somehow I run into this movie by the recommendation from a friend. I have to question his inteligency. This movie is as bad as one might think. Imbecile actors, miserable special effects with Elmer's glue, and in general complete stupidity with a touch of sadism. The one toward the viewer. Avoid wasting time."
2,Gore: 10 Story: 8 Music Score: -10,"Great gore...but, that is about it. May have been someting over 20 years ago. This movie works better than a strong sleeping pill!"
4,"oh Mr. Fulci, you are quite funny","Quite an overdone idea really. Random dead people come back to life, they kill people, those people come back to life to kill even more, so on until God knows when. I really enjoyed watching this movie, although it took me two viewings to appreciate it. Fulci uses mechanical spiders and a posse of live-corpses to convey a feeling of complete panic, then ends it all off with the movie's two central characters being isolated as they go into the unknown 'beyond.' One of the best party flicks out there."
4,One of the Greatest Italian Horror Films...EVER!!!!,"""the beyond"" has its bad spots, cheesy effects, and occasionally unbelievably bad dialogue. but there are enough genuinely horrific images that it can't be ignored. the opening sequence is extremely creepy and intense, and the ""nail through the back of the skull and out the eyeball"" scene is an eye-closer if there ever was one. highly recommended for those who like a good, creepy movie (and a tested ability to accept ridiculous amounts of blood and gore, but trust me, it's worth it). and as for anchor bay's dvd, it ranks as one of my favorite possessions. i snagged myself a copy of the limited edition tin, and the 48-page booklet is the best i've ever seen. it has tributes, essays, and a VERY lengthy & detailed fulci bio. very much worth buying."
4,The most anticipated horror DVD release ever,"Before anyone watches 'The Beyond', I highly recommend viewing 'City of the Living Dead' first because 'The Beyond' plays like a sequel to the latter...why more people haven't picked up on this who have seen both films is oblivious to me. With that aside, 'The Beyond' pretty much plays along with the usual Fulci fare...zombies, heads exploding (which is also featured in 'New York Ripper) melting flesh, and the signature eye gouging. The storyline is lacking as with most of Fulci's films with the exception of 'Cat in the Brain' (which is more autobiographical---Fulci was brought up on animal cruelty charges in the mid-80's). But what makes 'The Beyond' so different is the fact that Fulci had a unique talent to create atmosphere without much of a storyline and his and 'The Beyond' is his magnum opus for such feats."
3,Evil takes so many forms.***1/2,"The belief in evil lies in the imagination of the moviegoer.What we see on the screen might affect us depending on the type of person we are.For example,when we watch a horror movie like ""The Beyond"",there is no doubt in my mind that this is a film that came from the brilliant mind of Lucio Fulci.""The Beyond""challenges any horror film goer to simply take what they see on the screen.This is Lucio Fulci at his best."
3,I'm Being Generous Here...,"I'm an enormous Argento fan and was recommended Fulci's ""The Beyond"". Listen up: Not all Italian horror maestroes are the same. I am a huge fan of gore (especially that involving eyeball gouging), so after reading tons of reviews, I thought ""The Beyond"" would be perfect for my collection. Not so. Sure, there are several incredibly well done scenes (the nail-in-the-eyeball gets 5 stars from me), but there are many, many terrible ones. The score was fantastic, the story was great, and the atmosphere was perfect for a classic gorefest.... but something was missing. Fulci had a great thing going with the taratulas... I'm even willing to overlook the visible strings on the puppet spiders... but the scene where Emily had her throat torn out by her dog made me want to cut my credit cards in half. If you want to see the truly fabulous parts of the movie, try to find Necrophagia's video (its mentioned above). Summary: some great stills, but the movie is just too tiring to watch."
4,Classic Horror gets the full DVD Treatment!,"At last - Fulci's ""The Beyond"" being given the Anchor Bay treatment on a brilliant DVD, packed with extras. The actual film has been fully re-mastered and sound re-mixed, so with a 5.1 set-up you'll be litterally there with the main characters (but this isn't always such a good thing!!)Fulci's zombie opus is both visually stunning and entertaining - the levels of gore are as high as ever, some truly imaginative deaths and sequences. However, the story itself also holds up very well, the set pieces are excellent, lifting far beond almost any other zombie pic made. Whilst not maybe quite as fun as Fulci's 'Zombie', this is probably the one you want to get if you're at all curious about the zombie horror genre. Superb DVD and arguably Fulci's finest horror - watch this now!"
2,"Bought on a whim, glad it was cheap","My buddy & I got this movie after we found a cheap copy at a CD store... It was pretty enjoyable, but more for laughs than anything. The acting was corny and the plot was horribly incoherent. Great special effects for the time, though... not to mention the creative gore scenerios. I particularly enjoyed the scene with the little girl's head exploding."
2,Not a masterpiece,"I bought this movie because people say it's a masterpiece, shocking and jaw dropping. I love zombie movies, canibals and what ever else is out there with lots of gore and blood. I own many of the old classics, but this movie is no masterpiece. Anybody who likes these kind of movies should stick with Argento or Romero, those are the real masters of horror. I would recommended if you can find this movie for about $5, but don't pay more for it. Also bought Zombie, it's a little bit better. But doesn't come close to Dawn Of The Dead or any other Romero movie in that matter."
1,This is horrible. it makes me want to puke! Sad direction!,This is absolutely one of the most horrible movies i have ever bought. I made the mistake of buying it and I hate myself for it now. Dont buy it. Youll regret it. Everyone says its soooo good but its not. I like italian horror but Lucia lacks tallent. Check out some argento movies and forget about Lucio.
1,All the hype but nothing more...,"After hearing all the hype and reading so many reviews of this 'excellant' and 'classic' horror I took it upon myself to purchase the film. My initial thoughts were this this film is average to poor and did little to shock or scare me. The acting was ok but the plot seemed to be left behind. The only redeeming feature was the twist at the end but even this was very poorly orcanstrsated. I must say this film dissapointed me more than any other in recent years and as I certified film buff I plead with anybody, 'don't' watch this garbage. And save yourself!"
2,ZzZzZzZzZz,"... yep, gore ... yep, bad acting ... and long stretches of nothing ... yawn ..... Fulci is one of the most overrated of the Italian horror directors, and THE BEYOND is the prime example why ... I think alot of viewers might be drawn in because for a long time, these films ( in their glorious uncut form ) were so hard to find ... But being obscure doesn't always mean being good ... If silly waxy effects are your thing, then go for it ... I give 2 stars to the cool blind woman, and continue to appreciate to vastly superior LET SLEEPING CORPSES LIE for my zombie entertainment ..."
2,The best horrormovie in the world,"Lucio Fulci is, without doubt, the best director of horrormovies I have ever heard about it. With his film <The Beyond> he shows the suspense a film need. In the beginning, Dr. Schweick is tortured and murdered in hotel Mandeville in Louisiana, because he has the key of room 36, which has been built on one of the seven gates of hell. The scenes are very gore and bloody. By watching you can not get a break to leave. It is a movie you remain seated. The story is not difficult, but you have to pay attention as well. The music has been composed by Fabio Frizzi and it is a great score, starting after the prologue."
4,the Beyond,"This movie leaves a very unpleasant, depressing feeling, like most European horrors.It is a true horror."
2,Uncut? yeah right,"This is not uncut, at least the version I received was not. The only place you'll see the uncut footage is in the Necrophagia video in the extras. I am so angry right now that they butchered this great movie. The movie itself I give a 5, I had to rate it as a 2 though for the version I received. Still angry."
2,I'm not sure.....,"How the hell this move has an average of 4 stars. Granted I remember seeing this movie seven or more years ago, but I also remember turning it off about 45 minutes into it. Bad special effects, predictable suspense terrible acting, this is just some of the stuff I remember from this movie. I can deal with bad acting is the movie is meant to be funny. This is not funny."
2,"Boring, silly, and pretty much nonsense.","A woman discovers that a Louisiana hotel she inherited is one of the doorways to hell! Lucio Fulci's most highly regarded film is the worst of his that I've seen. As a whole, the movie is never very engaging and features far too many unintentionally hilarious scenes. Yes, the film looks great (love the hotel silhouette scene with all the zombies awakening) and has some memorable gore effects and a fairly action-filled finale, but for a movie that many proclaim as being plotless, this film sure ... has a lot of ludicrous plot holes. For more entertaining undead fun, stick with Fulci's Zombie or George Romero's living dead series.* 1/2 out of *****"
2,One of Fulci's Worst.,"After viewing this film a number of times I was still asking ""what?"". Shaky plot, lack of charecter development, poor acting make this film one of Lucio Fulci's worst. The only good thing about this film is that it ends."
4,Surprizingly entertaining,"I admit, I enjoy the worst horror film ever made more than the best romantic comedy. Call me crazy. I am always on the lookout for good horror films, and the search has led me to countless viewings of poorly dubbed, impossible to follow Italian beauties. However, ""The Beyond"" is different in that one can actually discern a plot-line thru all the gore. I won't go into specifics since there are already several other reviews that will clue you in. Suffice to say, Fulci has actually turned out a watchable and fairly decent horror film in ""The Beyond"". I definitely recommend this film to horror/gore fans. You won't be disappointed.Now, if romantic comedy is more your bag...well, better stick to anything with Meg Ryan in it and skip any and all of Fulci's ""masterpieces""."
5,BEYOND GREATNESS..,lucio fulci masterpiece this movie has everything creepy atmosphere good gore f/x good story. again thanks to grindhouse realsing for bringing out this gem of a movie.p.s still waiting for grindhouse to bring out cannibal holocaust hurry already.
5,FULCI'S MASTERFUL ARTWORK !,"This one is a full on masterpiece! Simpley one of the most atmospheric horror films of all time! Very creepy,very gory & one of LUCIO FULCI'S very best! A MUST!"
3,Limited Edition is No Value,"Arguably Fulci's best horror film, The Beyond probably deserves the most care of any in the Master's library. While commendable, this ""Limited Edition"" fails to justfy a price tag over double that of the regular version. The only extras in this package are a tiny booklet and a totally unecessary full-screen and cut version of the film (as it was known as ""Seven Doors of Death"". Don't make the same mistake I did. Unless you are a Fulci fanatic, or have money to burn, go with the [money] one. You'll get a beautifully mastered, uncut and widescreen presentation--all at a much lower price."
4,Cool but a little over rated.,"Don't get me wrong, I love this movie; I would consider myself a Fulci fan. But everyone raves about this movie as if it were a masterpiece, which I don't think it is. The movie can get a bit boring, and the tarantula scene makes me cringe at it's badness when ever I see those plastic spiders waddle towards their victim. The soundtrack can be so bad that it's good, I personally love it when those funky disco beats come in, but I could see how it can be somewhat laughable. For entertainment I perfer Zombie or House by the Cemetery, but this movie is still very good. I probably wouldn't recommend this movie to people who aren't familiar with this style of Horror."
4,Not a bad flick...,"This movie was one of Fulci's best. While not a true zombie film, it had more than its fair share of them. The movie itself had a decent enough storyline and the script was one of Fulci's better ones. The gore wasn't as realistic as I'd hoped, but there was a lot of it. Fulci used his usual eye-gouging and throat slashing to keep this one among his best gore-fests. The acid-in-the-face was a nice touch.By the way, when people in your home begin to die mysterious and gruesome deaths... it's time to move to the opposite end of the planet, Okay?"
5,The most see for gore fans!,"The Beyond is sure the best of Fulci.This is a gory movie.If you like gory movies this is probably in the ""must see"" category.In the 50's 60's Fulci directed(or writed)a lot of Comedies,but in the 70's he took to us 'The Lizard in The Woman's Skin"",and ""Dont Turture the Duckling"" that are thrillers if i know right.The people of Italy liked the style of Fulci and they liked Dawn of the dead too,so Fulci made a sequel titled as Zombie(AKA Zombie 2 in Italy),thats a big success again.Fulci made other horror movies like:Manhattan Baby and The Gates of Hell(City of the living dead),and Beyond.In Beyond,Fulci made new heights on the ""apocalypse feeling"".The Beyond's Story:A painter in the hotel opens one of the 7 doors of HELL(not death!),but the basement(where it is)is walled up.60 years later,Lisa a young girl inherit the hotel,and the gate opens again!This film has very graphic,and gory effects(spider scene)but if your a fan of this type of a movie,YOU MUST SEE THE BEYOND!"
5,FULCI'S BEST in a nice package...,"This is incredible. The print is excellent, the sound has been remastered into scary stereo, and it's UNCUT! Let's have more packages like this from Anchor Bay - this one contains 6 poster replicas and an excellent booklet, as well as the overwhelming pile of extras on the disc. If you do not buy this DVD, you deserve your eyes gouging out. A bargain, no less!"
5,a horror fans must have,"The Beyond is one of Fulcis better films. The tale is about the seven gates of hell and the end of humanity.That is all I will say about the ""PLOT"" , go to IMDB if you want a detailed breakdown. One of THE best Italian zombie/apocalypse ever made , right along side City of the Living dead-another Fulci classic- rightly getting the re-release it deserves. I couldn't wait for mine, I bought the limited edition Anchor Bay tin off eBay, for the rest of you have Grindhouse to thank."
1,"Plotless, and practically Zombie-less","I've read review after review (here and on the net) calling this film a classic zombie flick. This couldn't be farther from the truth. This movie fails at everything it attempts. It's not scary nor suspenseful. It's not even coherent. Why is the death of a man, found with his eyes torn from his head, ruled an accident?? This film is filled with similar head-scratching plot-holes. Probably the most glaring problem I had with this film is WHERE ARE THE ZOMBIES?? You don't even see any decent zombie action until the last 15 minutes of the film. ""The Beyond"" is not even rent-worthy. Stick with Romero or try one of the Asian Zombie flicks like Bio-Zombie."
3,A Book Only a White Sox Junkie Could Love,"It's got typographical errors. It's good poor sentence structure. It's got mediocre anecdotes about mediocre players. In short, it's a perfect book about the Chicago White Sox. (As a passionate White Sox fan, I get to say things like that!) Long before their current 2005 ""season to remember,"" the Chicago White Sox were unforgettable losers -- the kind of team only a die-hard fan could care about, year after year after year. I am one such fan, and so is the author. He's no John Steinbeck; his prose is pedestrian. But he loves this team and his book is a lovable one for anyone else who feels the same."
1,The 2006 Champs deserve better than this !,"Even if you love the White Sox like me, you won't like this book.As another reviewer wrote ""It's got typographical errors. It's got poor sentence structure. The author He's no John Steinbeck; his prose is pedestrian.""Stay away from 1959 and Beyond."
1,Does Go Beyond Dull Anyway,"This Arcadia entry should fill a need for book-starved White Sox fans... Unfortunately, the writing lacks any verve and the picture selection seems pretty dull. These are THE best pictures the publisher could come up with ? An amateur effort, at best."
5,Swisher Product,"Works perfectly on my linhaui utv after fabricating mounting bracket, do not know of a system that is made for this brand of utv, so with a little fab. job, great."
5,Great mount,I used this on my UTV along with a fabricated front mount. I can now front mount or with the use of quick connects move it easily to rear.
3,"Great at first, but now I am dissapointed.","I liked it at first but after wearing it for about 5 times, it broke into pieces while i was removing it from my finger. The size was perfect and the color was great but now I am sad because I was only able to enjoy it for a few times."
4,Solid Jade Band Ring,"Overall, I'm satisfied with this item. I would of liked one closer to the grass green color of that pictured on Amazon(mine is more the pale green that traditional Chinese drool over). That said, it fits 3 of my fingers, more substantial than the one I broke, and arrived in mail very fast, so I'm happy with it!"
5,The Mary Magdalene Tradition,This book opens up reflection about how women may have shared the gospel story within the realms that were available to them in a patriachal society. Hearon works carefully with various texts of the bible to show the flexibility of the story within established broad frames. A delightful book for any interested in the fundamental role of women in primitive Christianity.
5,Excellent Book,"I checked this book out of the library so many times that I finally decided to buy it. The chord progressions and examples are what make this book great, and they apply to all types of musical instruments. I use this book to compose on the computer, then sequence the songs into synthesizers.As for the negative reviews, my guess is that they don't understand what a chord progression is. But if you do, and especially if you've ever gotten stuck as a songwriter, get this book."
4,A interesting and unusual book,"This relatively new and fairly unusual book has a modern attractive layout. The content is fairly logically layed out. The book is easy to read and understand. The author provides some very useful insight into common song writing concepts (Abacab, etc.). Song references are diverse (a little too diverse for my tastes, especially as the title includes the phrase ""on guitar"") but I recognized most, and found the rules of thumb and examples helpful. If you are new to song-writing or self taught intuitively this is a great introduction. An experienced, knowledgable, well-read songwriter may find it less valuable, but might learn something. I found it interesting and a couple of songwriter friends have been itching to read it too!"
2,"Neither fish, nor flesh.","It's not a guitar method neither a complete songwriting book. Perhaps it's both, but I find it quite boring and not focusing."
2,Boring...,"Nothing revealed- nothing any guitar player doesn't already know. Too many words to convey too little information. Skip this book, ( and the others in his series) and keep looking. Youtube contains much more relevant and usable information. Save your money."
5,Excellent resource...,"This book is not going to make you a great guitar player and this book is not going to make you a creative person(but what book can??) What this book will do is give you a very strong foundation for chordal progression. The pop song which has been predominant for the last 50 years is analyzed in a straightforward handsome manner. A person with a basic understanding of guitar chords can get through this book and it is an excellent reference guide for those that are advanced musicians.This book is great for connecting the dots musically. For example, if you have written a bunch of riffs but don't know how to turn them into a song this book can help you gain direction.Again this book can't make you creative but it can help a creative person get a lot more output from focused effort. This book can give your chord sequences direction in affect turning your meandering strumming into an actual song."
5,great book,Husband loves the book and it made his Xmas s little brighter!! Made a great gift and I hope to hear some great songs soon!
3,Artificially Inflated Text,"A lot of technical issues covered. The outstanding thing about this book (& by outstanding I mean the thing that stands out, not the thing that is excellent) is that the author wants to tell you every song that fits into each and every category that he mentions. Example: for the chord sequence I, IV, VI, V there are ten examples in contemporay music and He wants to name each and every one of them, then he will do the same thing for chord sequence I, VI, IV, V. Etcetera ad nauseum! This is a thin book; It could be a lot thinner and convey the same amount of (interesting) information."
3,It's okay,"You can't beat Saxon Math products for quality math knowledge. And since the field of math doesn't change much at this level, even though the book is outdated it's still good."
4,good product,This book was in good shape being used and the curriculum is one of the best for Math. It is great because it reviews continually.
2,wasn't happy now I am,"I had a problem with the book at first,but the seller contacted me and offered to replace book.I will order from this seller again.I kept the book I had problem with because I had already fixed the problem."
2,Not Impressed,"I have heard good things over the years about this band, but if this istheir best - I am not impressed. Billing themselves as a punk band, theyseem to have little to say and dont do it very convincingly either. Ialways try to give any record 3-4 listenings, but I couldnt get throughthis wishy-washy mess a 3rd time. Maybe the albums individually arebetter since they seem to change their style from time to time? There aresome decent songs here, but I could have done without 75% of it. GimmeThe Clash, or Replacements, or Blue Meanies, or even PULP over these guys any day."
2,Outdated,"This book is quite inspiratational at first. That is, if you ignore when the book was written."
5,This album is excellent!,"Clip has a sound that is relevant and provoking. With the mixture of rock and electronica, they burn the map made by the forerunners of this genre and set off on their own journey. Each song on this record creates a whole. Each song is it's own character. ""Bad"" has the feel of the gritter girl in high school daydreaming about the bad boy who always comes up short but still is everything she wants. ""It Will Be Ecstacy"" has the catchiness and groove that everyone feels in the throws of a new relationship destined to go wrong. ""You're So Easy"" is pure animal lust in it's simplest form. ""Take It or Leave It"" is the anthem to how it seems this band really feels; like us or hate us, take it or leave it, we don't care.This band has a direction. There are many more songs on this cd that grab you and don't let go. If you're looking for a swift kick in the pants by a new band that really SHOULD go someplace, this is the cd to buy, this is the band to follow."
5,"COOL, HAPPY SONG...","I'd originally heard this song on Dance Mix USA Volume 4, released in the spring/summer of 1996. It's a happy house/trance mix (with a euro-style female vocal) that captures the essence of early 90s dance music. Think ""Move This"" by Ya-Kid-K, except with an even lighter, happier feel to it. If you're looking for a relatively obscure (yet sure to impress) early 90s style dance track, then you can't go wrong with this one.Thanks for reading!C.H.R."
5,Cool Truck!,I bought this for my nephew's birthday and he loves it! It's perfect for little kids and seems pretty indestructible.
3,Does not look like photo,Entire truck including the bed is blue. Silver parts are black. Actual toy does not look as nice as photo.
4,A treasure for any child's bookshelf!,What a delightful and beautifully illustrated book! My first impression of the illustrations were of my childhood when I would play with my cousins around grandma's house. Terry's writings also brought back memories of my parents and elderly relatives encouraging me as a child. This book is a treasure for any young child's bookshelf.
2,"My time comin', any day, don't worry about me, no.","Dennis was going to take his time with this book, because he was the man in the know, the ""insider"" and he was finally going to tell the story like it was. He didn't. I waited for YEARS for this book and it was a severe disappointment. Reveals nothing about personality of the band members, nothing! I followed the band for more than a decade, waited six years after Jerry'sdeath for ""Scrib"" to tell it the real story, only to discover that Rock Scully and Blair Jackson had already done it. Myheartfelt appreciation to BLAIR JACKSON for writing the definitive bio of the band, without even being an ""insider""."
3,Not Far Enough or Deep Enough,"It's odd that someone on the ""inside"" reveals so little. Lots of stories sound sanitized and rehashed with little vigor or insight, not much is added to the history, and the writing is at times awkward. I really expected a much better book. I would recommend Garcia An American Life as a superior alternative."
3,A Long Strange Read!,"I really looked forward to reading this book. After seeing the Grateful Dead Family Reunion shows this summer at Alpine Valley, and with McNally's ""insider"" status, I thought it would be revealing and insightful. The bottom line is that the writing is spotty at best, and cursory at worst. While opening some doors to the early years of the Dead, this book is jumpy from a historical standpoint. The author keeps emphasizing the importance of the ""here and now"" for the Dead, and their dislike and distrust of any commercial efforts that exploit their music, history, and status, but this read does exactly that."
3,Buy this book with a dictionary.,"While a most in-depth book about the Dead - A warning: You will either need to be a graduate English major or keep a dictionary close by to understand the points conveyed.Dennis McNally uses every word in the English language (and a few of his own design) to flower up the 620 pages of this book.I found the overuse of obscure wording very annoying. Sometimes ""less is more""."
3,lots of fun but not very objective,"I enjoyed this book but it was ruined by the lack of objectivity. The overall approach seems to be, hey, Jerry and His Friends took tons of drugs were terrible to women and emotionally unresponsive to their fans but, hey, the music was great and life is more or less random anyway. That's great when you're 15 but not much of a philosophy for adult readers. It may be too much to expect an ""official historian"" to be critical but others have balanced those roles better. There's a difference between history and hagiography and this is definitely on the latter side."
5,Gotta have this book!,"What a great piece of work! A very good history of the Dead phenomenon. Superb photos and writing, very detailed and researched. If I were to lose this book I would immediately buy another one."
5,Go Perry Go!!,"The DEFINITIVE Beatles price guide...Exhaustive info-fest on ALL U.S. Beatle and Beatle related stuff. Great info regarding counterfeit items and label variations. Although this wouldn't be considered a ""coffee table"" book, the pics are FINE and the eight page color section is a nice touch. Mindboggling in it's scope and obviously a labor of love, the Official Price Guide To The Beatles: Records and Memorabilia is a great read for ANY Beatles fan, and has probably sent many Beatles collectors back to the basement to re-evaluate their records..."
2,This book is supposed to be good?,"I have to say I was very disappointed with this book, especially after reading the Amazon reviews. The memorabilia section, especially, did not meet my expectations. In fact, most of the book is dedicated to the records, and there are many other books on that subject. And the pictures that accompany the text are ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS. There are no captions and the quality is horrible - they look like 12th generation copies of copies. The quality is so poor that you can't even discern some of them from each other. Furthermore, Some of the differences in the labels have to do with COLOR -- and yet most of the label pictures are in B&W.;Bottom line -- will someone step up and write a better book?"
1,Really POOR for new users!!!,"I tend to be extra generous in comments about computer books, but not today. If I can figure the example out for myself with enough guidance from the text I'm relatively happy. As a new Linux user this book is really bad. I wish I had of bought the Fedora 3 Bible, or absolutely anything else instead. It's easy to misunderstand or read over the product description 'Incorporating an advanced approach...'. Is this some sort of code for 'This book is for advanced users only', but without hurting sales to newbies? Clear as dum."
2,Does nothing,"Friend of mine recommended this to me. He swears by it - me, not so much. I had a teeny-tiny one on my hand, this stuff does nothing. You put a drop on, it dries up, next day, skin it was on is white. Sort of dead for a few days or so - that's it. Nothing falls off. Wart still there. This was a baby one too - no reason for this not to work."
3,An authentic Southern voice but,"I had wanted to read this book for a long time and now that I have , I have to say it wasn't exactly what I expected.The authentic Southerness was there and as a person who has grown up in the South, I recognized and related to that immediately.It felt very familiar. Most of the stories had gripping elements and a couple were especially engrossing, but a couple of stories just ended abruptly without any defined ending and although the author provided enough information throughout the narrative for you to know what would likely end up happening, that annoyed me quite a bit.I'm a reader that needs some kind of a definitive ending to feel satisfied and not getting one greatly impacts my enjoyment.Lee Smith is a talented writer and this book was a worthwhile read but not a book I'm likely to ever read again."
4,"Good product,... long wait","The product arrived sealed in it's original packaging,BUT,... when I purchased it, it said it would be delivered in a few days, and about two weeks passed before I recieved it. I live in Puerto Rico, which is part of the US, so that wouldn't be the reason, as I have recieved packages from other sources in regular timing. Nonetheless, I would probably purchase other articles from this seller."
5,Fun,"I am a physical therapist and this a really fun, complete work out. You dont end up with the painful muscle soreness in your abs, but they are working! I found myself smiling and laughing at times."
3,hip hop abs,"the product is fine and was delivered quickly. Does not work in my xbox, unfortunately, and that is the peice of machinery in my home gym in the basement. Now my husband has to look at me sweating in the family room while he is eating his dinner. hahahaha"
2,not very exciting,"an okay product, but can get very boring and tedious. And I felt no burn on my abs at all after any exercises. If you are looking for a good workout and want to stay entertained, I would opt for Turbo Jam instead. In Hip Hop Abs, Shaun T talks way too much also."
2,It was ok,I wanted to buy one before I went out and bought the whole set. This is not for beginning dancers. You would never get the steps down and keep up with him. The music is good the dance moves are good but I think you should already be a good dancer.
2,For beginners only,"I might just be hard to please, but I found these videos less than inspiring. I am an advanced exerciser and if you think this is going to replace a run, etc you need to look elsewhere.The workout has moments where your heart rate accelerates but unfortunately is not intense enough to keep it up there. There are so many intervals where you are just shuffling around, I had to do jumping jacks on the spot to keep my heart rate up.For the beginner who hates to exercise, this is an excellent starting point but if you're advanced you might want to try a dvd by Jari Love which has more challenging cardio."
2,Hip Hop Abs,"I borrowed this from a friend.The good: decent workout with a few new moves. Shaun has a lot of personality and makes it a fun workout. Very descriptive, not hard to follow.The bad: short. very short. I was surprised how little actual workout there is for the price. Could use more moves too but that's probably because the workout/dance portions are so short.Overall, not worth the price tag but if you can find it on the cheap it's ok. If he put out a DVD full of workout content instead of fluff and filler, I might buy."
5,THIS WORKS!!!,"This works!! After just a week of exercising to the Total Burn (30 minutes) workout, I can tell the difference! A six pack is forming!! The Total Burn (40 minutes) with the dumbells is challenging, but also fun! My stomach is getting firmer right before my very eyes! The dance moves makes this DVD absoulutely addictive! I now look forward to exercising! Highly recommend Shaun T!!"
3,It was OK,"After hearing so many raves about this video from other fitness enthusiasts I was a little disappointed. I think he is very charismatic and a very good instructor so it it nothing against him personally. I just found that the it was not a challenging cardio or ab strengthening routine. I enjoyed the moves and found him to be very entertaining as well as a good dancer. However the pace was a bit slow for me and I didn't feel anything in my abs. Plus there were too many brakes between the sets. I would have liked for it to keep building in momentum. Lastly, I found the facial experessions of some of the background dancers to be extremely corny. I now use it as a warm up for other cardio or strength-training workouts. I'm not giving up on him though. Will definitely look into some of his more advanced workouts including Insanity."
5,Fantastic for people who want to have fun when excercising,Not too hard on the joints and you can have fun adjusting to your own pace. been using 2 weeks and already lost a pound!
4,LOVE IT!,I bought the hip hop abs package on Amazon because the price was amazing for it..if bought off it's original web site you pay triple...i got it within i believe 5 days of my order and it is wonderful! Everything i expected!! love it...
4,Entertaining and challenging,This was a fun workout dvd to excercise to. Shawn T is funny and keeps your mind off actually working out. The ab moves are effective. I'm not a stranger to working out by any means & I was sore the next day. It's definitely a nice change of pace.
4,Excellent Ab workout,The Ab workouts really work. The series gives you a variety workout and routines that do not over lap. It really works.
5,Love it,This video is great. More intense than the first hip hop abs video I got. Lots of energy and lots of burning!
