5,a must read book for analysis of myth,"I was amazed by the extensiveness of issues discussed in this book. Barthes had gone beyond the so-called 'conventionalized' myths. Rather than talking about Hercules, he discussed about wrestling in the perspective of myth. I think if you are interested in structuralist-poststructuralist analysis of myths you must read this book."
5,FASTER THAN POSSIBLE!!!,Product was exactly as described and arrived at my doorstep the next day and I didn't even order 1 day shipping! Amazing!
2,baby wagon gift basket,"This product is way overpriced for the size it is,,,,beware the picture is very deceiving,,,the whole thing actually fits into a box that is 10""x15""x15"" much smaller than expected,,,"
2,"Like Corporate Business, Foreigner Distorts Talent Potential","It seems as though this group has just begun their Deep Purple like segment of Greatest Hit/Live CD's. Band enthusiasts want to listen to the group's musical talent(s) and not repeat run-for-the-money track sets. Almost every Classic Rock listener has a CD player by now and can easily jump back or skip forward to favorite hits on disc. In other words, successive arrangements of released hits aren't needed. And if they think Urgent is something supporters would appreciate `live` at the BBC, it's time for them to recall that broadband radios in fact exist or are available. So keep those Head Games to yourselves, Foreigner, and give your fans credit for buying the chronicles they since already have drained their money savings with..."
5,Very helpful,"Great little book. I bought it here after checking it out one day in a bookstore. It had all these logical little tips in it. It goes room by room, and the best part for me was: ""things to look for"", and it'll just name things that you should find and toss. What was i thinking keeping a bunch of random keys around. :D. And freakin' takeout menus. I tossed the old keys and put the menus in a folder. The book is much better than that, but those were the first 2 things i did. I've seen a ton of decor, declutter and organize books. this one is really good. I've given 2 away, just about to give away my recently purchased copy and now have to repurchase again for myself."
1,AWFUL SUBSTITUTE,While I didn't expect this to be nearly as good as the real thing.....I did expect it to somewhat resemble potatoes. Someone had to work really hard to make something that tastes this nasty!!! Absolutely awful!!!!
2,Interesting Observation,"Gee, these other two reviews seem so unbiased and non-commercial! There's no way that friends of the author could have written these reviews chocked full of infomercial lingo. 2 stars for this shady garbage."
4,Duh springs,"Nice, good looking and sold as a pair like the shocks. Installed on the shocks with ease. Price is bit high just like the shocks."
5,vana rocks,"Vana is a talented artist and his CD was excellent.I have his CD ""Small Regrets"" and that is as extraordinary as the""A New Day"" CD.Buy it - you won't be disappointed !"
4,Get Control!,I wish I had found this book years ago. It explains all the differnet concerns regarding theft at a bar. It is easy to go through and pull out the information that most meets the needs of the business. Way to go Plotkin!
5,Excellent Summary of How Bar and Restaurant Employees Steal,"As a college level instructor of Forensic Accounting, I've found that the only way to teach and learn the subject is through concrete examples. Theory doesn't cut it.This book is remarkably comprehensive and will give bar and restaurant owners, and prospective bar and restaurant owners, a leg up on dealing with employee theft.I used it successfully in auditing a wine bar and shortly thereafter had one of the tricks (shorting servings) pulled on me in another wine bar by the night bartender. I told the manager, but it turned out that he was in on the scheme. The big lesson is that you can't trust any of your employees.Does it cover every possible scheme? No, but at least it helps level the playing field.Readers who want a more general view of business fraud and theft may wish to buyForensic and Investigative Accounting, 4th edition"
1,Poor quality,"I just purchased this leash. After using it for 3 days, the reflective material started to peel right off. I have had it now for 2 weeks, and there is only 50% of the reflective material left on it. There is no guarantee that it will stay on. It's a nice leash otherwise. Very strong and sturdy, it's just that the reflective material doesn't stay on."
3,Too big,"I have one I previously got from Walmart and I figured it was the large one but it was not. I still love them, very sturdy and good if you get caught out walking after dusk."
1,Don't buy this product,"This leash lasted less than a month pulling apart & unraveling at the handle. I have 3 dogs, 2 labs around 70 pounds & a 100 pound german shepard. You can get a very similar version of this reflective leash in red or black at Walmart for less than $8. I wanted a different color which is why I chose to buy this one online for a higher price. My black Walmart purchased leash is almost a year old. Some of the reflective material has worn off but it's still in great shape showing no signs of unraveling."
1,Not worth the money,First I have no issues with the seller. This product is cheap. I have 3 dogs. 2 labs 70 pounds & a german shepard 100 pounds. I have purchased 2 of this brand. Both pulled apart at the handle & unraveled while on walks. My dogs are very well behaved & do not pull much. I would expect a leash to last more than a month. Walmart sells a similar brand for half the price (less than $8). The reflective material stays on much better & the leash from Walmart has lasted almost a year with out pulling apart. I have already replaced this red leash with a red one from Walmart & will be buying a 2nd black one to replace the blue one I bought.
3,Great leash but don't buy for the safety material,"This leash is very sturdy and well-made EXCEPT for the reflective material. It began to peel off the handle during the 1st use. Within a month less than half remained and I finally peeled the rest off because it was making a mess. I am here to buy another one because it finally tore up after 2 years of very heavy use by my large, rambunctious, water-loving lab. I can't find another leash like it so I'm just going to get another one and plan to peel the reflective material off sooner this time."
2,Poor Quality,"The leash is very reflective which is nice. I wasn't happy with the quality of the product. I have seen other leashes like this that were created on a rubber core and the wrapping was very tight. This leash has a nylon rope at the core, the reflective part is wrapped around it (loosely) and the wrapping came undone the second time I used it."
2,"Great Leash, BUT, Mine Fell Apart in 14 Days","The leash is extremely comfortable and so forth; however, it is interwoven and it fell apart within 14 days. The interwoven strands have frayed and pulled apart.FYI: this leash was used with a 3-way coupler to walk tow 15lbs dogs and a 30lb puppy: so no, it wasn't abused with a 100lb mastiff....Disappointing; I am contemplating sending it in for a refund, but I have used it so, I'm not certain how that goes."
2,Firstrax Glo'n Go Small Leash,"Firstrax Glo'n Go Small Leash - 6 ft - BlackI have 3 small dogs (under 30 pounds) and, while the leash part is exactly what I wanted, the snaps are big enough to lead a horse with. They are too big and way too heavy for small dogs."
5,The Definitive Work!,"OK, the book is a bit expensive, but it is a class act with no expense spared in the production. Top quality photographs, superb binding, complimented by a beautifully de bossed cover. The author spent 10 years in researching this work and tapped fantastic source material. Photographs and illustrations compliment nearly every page, and are as impressive as the text. Tons of information, most never in print before. You could buy many books with Richmond muskets in them and never touch the surface of Davies' book. Lots of disassembled weapons and parts. Tools and bayonets are even covered. Great for novice and advanced collectors alike. I wouldn't think of buying a Richmond without owning and studying this book first. It is such a pleasure to spend this kind of money, or even much less, and feel you received a bargain. Definitely the definitive work on the subject that will hold the test of time. I wouldn't pass this one up for my reference library."
3,Synopsis,"From the back of the book:IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED but it had. And in the years since then, Kit McHennessy had never been able to escape the memory of her one night of love with Justin O'Niall.Now she was back in Ireland again, back in the tiny village of Shallywae and, before long, back in Justin's arms. But the past still haunted her, and there were questions to be answered before she could let herself think about love. Lives had been lost all those years ago, and the present seemed no less dangerous. Suddenly Kit was forced to realize that she might not live to taste the happiness a future with Justin offered."
5,i know,We all know the drama behind thiss band so lets move on. I love all their songs even though they didn't sing a note. I would still be rockin this album if my tape didn't pop.
4,blast from the past,"You cannot help but be addicted by the dance and funky beats of the dynamic duo from Germany.They stole the european music scene in late 80's with this release masterminded by German producer Frank Farian.He blended together the perfect euro dance sound and the right faces to sell it to the masses; the result is one of the most enjoiable record of the 80s. Some said that the guys on the front cover(Rob & Fab)didn't sang a line in it, but who really cares with so much fun ?"
2,Puppets who played the Game,"""Girl you know it's true"" was a cool Pop song.they got Unmasked but that was a Cleaver Idea matching Faces with Voices.nowadays I wish that was the norm.so many weak Singing Chumps out nowadays that nothing seems to match.because the Guys who really sung the songs were Alright nowadays the Video Acts all almost look the same&can't hardly Sing at all."
5,Ghettofabulous,"All I can say is ""I""m gunna miss you, boys; I'm gunna miss you."" I have never felt so moved by music than when I listen to Milli Vanilli. When I am down, Rob and Fab are there to bring me a smile. And when I am feeling good, Rob and Fab keep me dancin'. Rob and Fab are ghettofabulous. I am a girl, and boy, do I know it's true."
2,Lost the old sound,"I had hoped to get all the hits (i.e., Blame it on the Rain) yet keep the original sound when purchasing the Remix disc, but alas, the sound has been lost. I yearn for the ""Milli Vanilli"" of old."
2,Not Like The Original,"If you are looking for the original sounds, you will not get it entirely on this CD. There are times when you can here a little of the original sounds, but then on the next track it just goes away! The CD remixes are not very good. If you just want to remember some of the old music you might take a chance. Some of the tracks are tolerable if you just want to reminisce about the old band....honestly buy it used!! The CD quality is indeed poor."
5,"Gorgeous, informative","Purchased this book to use as a classroom aide. It's fantastic for that purpose. Images are both engrossing and educational. Which is the best feature for middle school students. Hook them with the images, they'll read more about it."
1,Tub Gasket from Home Depot/Lowes,I found a rubber gasket at home depot slighly thicker (read better) and a little wider at home depot in the plumbing department. It was the tub drain size for $2.50. Also in that department they had the rubber in 6x6 squares that you can use to make your own gasket with a pair of scissors if you just want to trace your old one. I think that was $4 for a pack of 2 but you can trace two of these gaskets on each sheet so you end up with 4 gaskets for 4 dollars (or 2 thick ones if you double up). Save your money.
5,A fine replacement,My rubber gasket ended up clinging to the bottom of a wet pan headed to a hot stove top. After a dazzling display of home firefighting skills and cursing I purchased this (new blades didn't hurt either) and the ol' Cuisinart blends like new.
5,"ULTRA FAST SHIPPING, Great way to replace a bad gasket","The gasket literally arrive what seemed to be next day. The described item came, and they actually shipped a blender blade for me too... I don't think they meant to. Either way they didn't charge me for. A free $15 value. Not much to say about the product, its a exact replacement of what the manufacture provides. Works great. Will buy again."
1,Had to return,It was an international version of the dvd and would not play in my player had to send it back and get a refund. Lookout for that
1,DVD Player Couldn't Read the DVD,"Not the actual movie, its great! The DVD that was sent did not play in my DVD player, which does not seem to have any issues with my other DVDs. Ended up sticking it in the laptop, and my CD/DVD player was able to read it there. However, watching the DVD with my daughter on the laptop was not the family night I had hoped for. I just won't buy from that retailer again."
1,How Do You Clean This Thing??????,"Argh. Although this cup is indeed spill-proof, it seems almost impossible to clean effectively. I have just emailed OXO to find out it there's a way to disassemble the top, as there seems to be a lot of room under the ""clicker"" for gunk to build up. Those of you who own this mug, any tips appreciated. I drink milk in my coffee so the potential for mold, rotten milk, etc building up is pretty bad. I did remove the gasket but there's still the interior of the lid that's tough to access. I also noticed that it was getting harder to drink and realized that the teeny airhole was blocked - I used a toothpick to clean it out. Yuck!"
1,Mold in lid!!!,"It's true that this mug does not leak, but when I wondered why my coffee was starting to taste funny I looked closely at the lid and was disgusted by what I found. I was always careful to rinse the lid as soon as I finished my coffee, but somehow a layer of mold had formed inside of the lid, which you can't get to to really clean. It was a thick layer of goo and it was gross! I like the cup, but won't continue to use it if I can't figure out how to properly clean it. I fear it is a health hazard. Any suggestions?"
3,Depends on your priority,"The quality of this mug really depends on your personal priority of containment vs. heat retention. In two years of use, this mug has never spilled liquid. I frequently toss it into a bag or briefcase with no spills. If your priority is a mug that seals tightly without leaks, this is a good product for you.However, if you want to pour your coffee, drive to work, check your messages, then settle into the day with your coffee - you will be very disappointed with this mug. Your coffee will be room temperature after 30-45 minutes. I rarely finish the coffee before it gets cold.Other good vs. bad:Good - only the lid requires hand washing; the cup itself can go in the dishwasher. I run my cup through the dishwasher once a week to get a thorough clean.Bad - the lid is very difficult to clean, and I imagine there's quite of bit of bacteria and other nastiness that has accumulated in the lid over my two years of use."
1,Worst experience,I ordered these shoes and up to now have never received the shoes. This is my worst experience ever online. I have written emails and up to date have not seen a replied from the company. I have written to Amazon in hopes of a refund or I will not purchase anything from Amazon again. My husband Richard Munro and I shop on Amazon on a regular basis and I am very disappointed in this Yshop being advertise on their site. Since I ordered my shoes I have seen tons of negative feedback about this particular store and Amazon have made all the products this store offered currently unavailable so no one else can place order with them but in the meantime I still havent gotten a refund and I will not order anything else on here unless I do. Its the principle of the whole thing. People should not be this dishonest.
1,Don't waste your money,Brought this and less than two months later the strap broke. Went to shop repair to get it glue back in but then a week later the clasp broke! Just poorly made. My last shoes (different brand) last me at least whole year. Probably not worth it to get it repair.
1,Good... but outdated,"I think this was the second book I bought when I found out I was expecting twins (the first book was Dr. Luke's pregnancy book). I thought a first-hand accounting would be great.It was a good book ... when poppa Bush was president, maybe. A lot of the advice is pre- cell phone and pre-internet, so it was too stale to be useful. And, yes, like the prior reviewer said, breastfeeding is doable with twins for sure. I hope the couple that wrote the book think about updating it; I'm sure lots of supertwin parents need a book of their own."
3,"Great for triplets or more, less good for twins","I bought this book based on the positive reviews I saw here at Amazon, but I was very disappointed when I read the book myself. I have 6-month-old twins and although there were some useful tips here and there, I feel that the book is really geared more toward triplets and higher-level multiples. The biggest example: this book barely addresses breastfeeding (very do-able with twins; much more challenging with triplets and more) and instead spends a great deal of time offering advice for coordinating the preparation of bottles and formula. While it is wonderful that those of you with 3+ have this book, I don't recommend it to parents of twins."
4,Terrific start to a new series,"I thoroughly enjoyed Without a Trace. This was a page-turner with suspense building all the way through. I'm not a romantic suspense fan (don't dislike it; just usually reach for something else), but Ms. Coble delivered a great read. I will definitely be looking for the next book in the series."
3,This really needs to be in a religious/inspiration section,"When I bought this book, the reviews were few. Now people are writing about the christian aspect of this book. It was too religious for me and reading about people finding G-d, Jesus and praying. My point in writing this review is to only give a heads up to those folks that are expecting a mystery but find a lot of writing about being a christian."
5,Way awesome book,"I totally recommend this book to anyone who loves a good suspense/mystery with a little hint of romance in it book. I couldn't put it down for a long time! It was so good! I actually cried when I got towards the end. I felt like I actually knew Bree. I felt her troubles! As the back of the book jacket says from one reviewer, you have to actually stop and remember that they are just characters in the book, and you don't have to pray for them!"
3,Easy read,"The book was just a nice easy read. Nothing too captivating and a little predictable--at least I found it to be. Enjoyable but for me not a ""wow, I can't put it down"" book."
1,"Don't buy the hype - this ""book"" bites","Choppy doesn't even begin to describe the poor writing in this ""book"". This ""book"" is published by a division of a big time religous publisher and is a message not a novel - if you don't want to be preached to don't buy this ""book"". Wish amazon would let you rate it as a 0 or into the negatives - doesn't deserve ANY star!!"
3,TLC,"Lacks the flow of the others in the series, I expected more closure. Still as sci-fi goes is gave some surprises."
3,Even an average Hambly is a good read - but this is average.,"Barbara Hambly is one of my favorite authors, and I jumped at the chance to visit Renweth again! But I was a little disappointed; on the whole ""Icefalcon's Quest"" doesn't have the edge some of Hambly's earlier work does, it has less subtlety. It's a good read - as ever, her imagery is compelling. But it is not up to the high standard of the original series, and lacks characterization and taut, elegant plotting that makes me loan ""Dragonsbane"" to everyone who holds still long enough."
5,Better Homes and Gardens Heritage Cook Book,If there were 50 stars it couldn't express enough how valuable this book is! We were given a copy when it first came out and it has been used to the point of falling apart. It is a great book with lots of educational stories in it as well as hundreds of recipes. It covers history quite well and gives detail of how many recipes came about. Many great and wonderful recipes and helpful hints for cooking lie between the pages of this huge book! I am grateful it is available! I was told it was no longer in print and could not be purchased!
5,best teaching tool I have,"My mother got this book new in '75 or '76. She used it all through my teen years. When I left home, I permanently ""borrowed"" it, with her permission. I have cooked from it for years and many of my favorite recipes are in it. I find it highly useful for teaching my homeschooled four-year-old topics ranging from healthy eating to history to other cultures. Even though old recipes aren't exactly diet food, they are usually far healthier than the average chicken nugget or big mac. She has learned a wide range of favorite foods from this book. It is also very easy to tie these recipes into reading Laura Ingalls Wilder, or other historic kids novels. Read Farmer Boy and make Boston Baked Beans and Rye 'n Injun Bread. Read about George Washington and cook colonial English foods. Read Yonnie Wondernose and cook Chicken Stolzfus. Watch An American Tail and make borscht. Read Breaker Boy and make Cornish Pasties. There is a wealth of good stuff in here."
5,smell washes out,"i've been using ojon for a year or so, and my hair has never been healthier. i have long, fine, wavy hair which i flat iron about 5 times a week; this product definitely keeps your hair shiny and protected from heat damge and split ends. hair stylists are always amazed at the great condition my hair is in being that i heat treat it so often, and i get comments all the time from friends, family, and just people i encounter about how shiny and pretty my hair looks. the smell is distinctive (not offensive in my opinion), but you wash the product out out! my hair smells like my shampoo/conditioner, so i really don't understand what the other posts about the smell are trying to say. i definitely reccomend this product and do so often."
4,Great Stuff even for fine hair,I have baby fine blonde hair. Love this stuff. The smell is fine for me but I have to use it when my husband is not around as he can't stand the smell. I love the softness it gives and it does not stay heavy at all. A product that can be used for African American hair and baby fine blonde hair? Awsome!
5,delicious smell & great product,"I absolutely love this product. The ojon smells like coffee to me which is a good thing. I can't understand how some people say this smells like cigarettes. I have never smoked in my life and can't stand the smell of cigarettes, yet I think this product smells wonderful! I guess to each his own. I like the fact that this product melts with your body heat and you need just the smallest amount to see an improvement."
2,The smell is too strong,"Hi, I bought this from QVC and I couldn't believe how awful smelling it was... kind of like burnt coffee and smoke covered with a perfume - aack! It made my hair feel soft, but the smell was just too overpowering! I can get the same results using pure melted shea butter instead. Maybe some people will be able to get used to the smell, but I'm not one of them."
2,ojon,"I have VERY dry frizzy hair.This treatment left my hair softer,now my hair is a big soft frizz ball, it added too much body.I like this better for use as a grooming gloss."
2,"Works well, but is nothing more than American Palm Oil","I read the label, and it is not a rare, tropical oil at all, but plain old American palm oil! False advertising really bothers me. It did condition my hair well, but I agree that the fragrances (which are added to it, by the way) make the odor very strong and unpleasant. The price is also very high. I will not order this again."
4,I'm looking forward to the possibilitys now.,"Okay, my part of the say for this hair treatment.1) Its does make hair softer and healthier but for me, its making it too heavy. I'm guessing its the oil that gets left behind after you wash it off. If that's the kind of product your looking for, you should buy it.2) You have to get used to the potent smell. The fact that you have to sleep with this in your hair, I wasn't too happy with the smell in my dreams.3) Sacrifice a hair towel. Unfortunately the smell and oil wont come out of the towel after washing so, make sure to have a towel just for Ojon!4) But seriously, if you need MAJOR repair for your hair, CUT the damage off and use this every week as instructed. It will WORK!"
5,I Love It and Will Never Be Without It,"I have thick, coarse, african-american hair that is relaxed (permed straight). I usually use this product on wet hair (after a shampoo)when blow-drying my hair straight. It makes it really smooth and shiny. I have received a lot of compliments on my hair since I have started using it. In warm temperatures it does melt down but in my opinion it makes it easier to use. When it is a solid you are supposed to rub it in the palm of your hands to liquify it and then put it in your hair. It does have a smokey scent to it but no one pays attention to that...they are looking at how great my hair is. I love Ojon's conditioner (it is the very best I have ever used)but the shampoo in my opinion seems to dry my hair."
4,Ojon Hair Treatment,Ojon restorative hair treatment is a Very good product. The hot treatment leaves my hair soft and manageable. I will continue to order it.
5,Great Hair Treatment,"The Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment is my little secret. Whenever my ends are dry, I use a little restorative hair treatment and my ends turn silky smooth. I use it overnight before washing my hair with Ojon Ultra Hydrating Shampoo and it makes a big difference in how my hair responds. Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment is a must have for African American women."
1,Broke off my hair,"I bought this product after seeing it on QVC and reading all the wonderful things about it online. My hair was healthy prior to using it, with no major damage. However, I decided to try it for added strenght and shine. I used it as a preconditoner, because I couldn't take the smell any other way. The first time I used the product, my hair looked absolutely beautiful, shiny, wonderful. The second time I used it, my hair started breaking terribly and I immediately knew it was this treatment because that was the only thing I was doing differently.I really hate I saw this product and decided to waste my money. God Bless all of you who like this product, but my hair is much worse than it was before and I really want my money back. If anybody wants it, I am willing to send it to you free of charge (just pay shipping and handling).This product was soooo expensive, I can't bring myself to throw it out, but it definitely will not go on my hair again!"
2,Don't Use This Product if you Color Your Hair !!!,"I bought this stuff from the Shopping Channel, and thought it wasn't bad, until I went to get my hair colored.The color didn't take!My hair is shoulder length, and I only used the Ojon on the bottom 5 or 6 inches, because that's the part that was dry.The color only took on the 'new growth', not on the rest of my hair - the hair that I had put the Ojon on!The smell of the oil, the shampoo, or the conditioner didn't bother me, but the HAIR SPRAY was disgusting. People remarked that I had overdosed on perfume, so I had to wash it again to get the rotten smell out of my hair.I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who colors their hair."
2,Can't stand the smell,"I would rate the conditioner average to below average for fine curly hair. Returned it because of the smell. Rancid chocolate may be okay with some, but not me."
1,Freaked Out,"My sister gave me the shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and the giant brown chocolatey ball for my birthday.This product works great.However, be cautious of how you keep it. After a month of having it, I found maggots all over the ball of soap and now i'm afraid to use any of this product anymore.It's too expensive a risk. Fortunately, we received a refund. However, soap that can support maggots is kind of frightening."
2,You're better off with essential oils,"I admit, I got sucked in watching QVC and with the idea of getting something special from the rain forest, but honestly, if you read the ingredients there is nothing special about this product. I now use a 2 dollar essential oil mix (peanut, castor, olive, almond, wheat germ, and sesame seed oils, as well as vitamin E) as a pre shampoo treatment and it works better than this. (Can be found at Sally's, walgreens, and even walmart) If Ojon works for you that's great, but this product really is an overpriced hot oil treatment."
5,A blast from my past!,"This book brought me back into a world that i was once in!I, like Cristina went to a summer camp as a counselor expecting the worst but recieving the best gift of all from it- self recognization. I too went to a metamorphisis while i was there caring for youngsters, and learning to be a leader. This book relates to everything in life. It's taught me a lot about relationships, and how to deal with every day problems. I love how this author incorporated her novel into her website at .... I've been there many times and am very impressed by the special features and interactions. I think it is unique that she let youth incorporate their ideas into the book, and let their voices be heard. That's one of the key ingredients to how this book came together. (besides the wonderful author, wife, and mother) I highly recommend it to all those interested in finding their own path in life, and to those who are looking for a good story to read by the fire."
3,Could of been much better,"Not a bad effort, and if you're a hardcore Genesis fan, the ""reunion"" recording of Carpet Crawlers is great -- better than the original! Now I wish all Genesis fans could persuade this band to develop a truly incredible reunion album with some original songs.Other than that, there's too many Invisible Touch songs here. Why not include Man on the Corner and some other early 80s tunes?"
4,viva Genesis......,"okay...i'm a die-hard fan and i've seen the reviews here. 4 stars only because it's a great mix of the songs everybody knows AND ""Carpet Crawlers"" is wonderful...such a vibe from this re-do. However! yes there are many songs i would have liked to have seen on there instead. Tony Banks was quoted as saying ""we just put the radio hits on there...we didn't want to choose favourites"" COME ON! i agree that the fans should have voted...but oh well..mind us that Gabriel Genesis was definitely not radio friendly. i am glad they put a Ray song on there even if it was ""Congo"". it's good for the car CD player. at home i have about everything....bye!"
4,You've Got to Get In To Get Out.,Genesis brings back one of their greatest singles of all time to 1999- Carpet Crawlers. Possibly signifying the last time the original players of one of the greatest progressive rock bands will play together. Kudos.
3,Standard fare w/ a couple annoying edited versions,"Well, it's certainly a good selection of Genesis hits, but they cut an entire verse out of Mama and spliced off the Abacab instrumental. This really should be a multi-CD set. Otherwise, they should have cut the lengthy but pointless introduction on Congo (or just left that track off entirely)."
3,gensis hits,"If you love Genesis you will like this, but if you just like them you might not like this to much."
3,Get the newer tour version instead.,This version is okay for the causal fan. I recommend getting the tour version instead of this because it contains more songs and two more disks.
3,OK,"Covers all the bases and then some, one HUGE omission. Left out No Reply At All which is a top 5 song in My opinion. Little obscure in places for me ie. ""Wardrobe"" & ""Carpet Crawlers"""
1,Repackaged,"This is not an upgrade, all Rhino did was put a cardboard jacket on the CD.If you have this CD it's the same as this one."
2,Turn it Off Again: The Crap,"Oh My God. If I want to listen to this kind of crap, I'll buy a Phil Collins album. This has got to be the worst collection of Genesis music I have ever seen. Firstly, There is only one original Genesis on here (I Know What I like [In Your Wardrobe] ) from back in the day. The only other song from real Genesis is the remake of ""Carpet Crawlers."" Secondly, all of this stuff on this album is pop. Genesis was Progressive Rock. There are only two songs from the Peter Gabriel era on there. The rest are all Phil Collins trash; poppy, irritating, and bland. Each song from the Collins time is predictable and distasteful. It's for stupid people who do not have the time to analyze songs. I suppose if you want to listen to Genesis' mainstream attempt at fame, this is the album for you. However, if you want THE REAL GENESIS, consider buying ""Foxtrot,"" ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway,"" ""Selling England by the Pound,"" and others BEFORE THE PHIL COLLINS ERA!!"
3,Pobres grandes éxitos,"Esta etapa que abarca desde 1978 hasta 1997, es más bien pobre que buena: Los álbumes de excelente rock progresivo de la étapa de Peter Gabriel se han dejado a un lado, privandonos de obres maestras como ""The Knife"", ""Cinema..."" y ""At the beginning"".La étapa de Phil Collins esta bien reprensantada, amargando al personal con pop del facilón, del cual solo algunas obras se salvan de la quema: como ""Mama"", ""Turn it on again"", ""I Can't dance"", o la mejor del famoso disco ""invisible Tocuh"", ""Land of confusion"", el video de este tema es uno de los mejores que existen. Por otra parte, del disco ""Calling all the stations"" el mejor en mi opinion, a lo largo de toda su dilatada carrera, incluye en este recopilatorio el sencillo ""Congo"", Gigantesca canción que nunca obtendrá el reconocimiento merecido, por cierto del bloque del grupo original solo quedan los incansables Mike Rutherford y Tony Banks, ayudados ahora por la magistral voz de Ray Wilson"
3,ONLY for Carpet Crawlers...,"As a fan of the older Genesis -- Duke was the last really good album, IMO -- I bought this ONLY for the truly excellent version of Carpet Crawlers. I overheard it by accident on the radio (! ) and was stunned by how great it sounded. It makes you WISH that the best lineup - the crew from Lamb Lies Down On Broadway -- would get together and record an album's worth of NEW material... or do what they did here and rerecord some of the older stuff (a la Steve Hackett's interesting Watcher Of the Skies)... If you are not a big fan of LLDOB, skip this CD. If you are passionate for the old band and you enjoyed the recent box set, sacrifice the $$ and get this for that ONE rerecorded song. Although the album got 3 stars, that one song gets 5+ ..."
3,"More or less disappointing, and THAT'S ALL.","First of all, the moment the producers screw me with an edited version of a hit song simply for the sake of space, THAT'S ALL, you've lost me! This is what's done with ""ABACAB"" and ""MAMA""; two classic Genesis songs destroyed! The second flaw is including the song ""Congo"", which was not even a hit. I don't even remember who sang it in Phil Collins' place.On the plus side, we get to hear a new version of ""The Carpet Crawlers"" with Peter Gabriel reunited with his old band members. Sadly, this never resulted in a reunion tour.This is the only Genesis greatest hits package to date. As an alternate, consider any of the live recordings, which will give you a great mix of their hits at the time they were recorded."
3,Most of the tracks are edited +only pop period in here,"This is not so good compilation. I mean ""abacab"",""mama"" or some other's are great tracks, but why are they all edited? it is cruel for them, they are loosing all of their power.also the featured ""i know what i like"" with peter gabriel (from 1973) is not so good here, between catchy Phil collins songs.better buy ""invisible touch"" or ""abacab"" albums if you are beginner fan.If you have already some Genesis albums buy it for ""Carpet Crawlers 99"" - Peter's vocals are fantastic - ps. this is a rare track!"
2,WARNING: The songs are edited!,"I love Genesis, but I cannot endorse this collection. Naturally, it is impossible to include all the songs that fans might want in a single-volume; that doesn't bother me so much. However, I think it was a huge mistake to shorten many of the songs here -- especially ""Mama"", in which an entire verse is removed at its emotional arc.My opinion: die-hard Genesis fans will get excited at the start of each song...and be annoyed by the end of many. For this reason, I can only give the collection 2 stars."
2,"I'm all for budgetary cutbacks, but not musical ones","I was anticipating this new release featuring many of my fave tunes from the Collins-era Genesis. Sadly, I was disappointed by the content: many of the tracks are radio edits. ""Tonight, Tonight, Tonight"", ""Abacab"", and ""Mama"" are three of the cut-back songs that make this Greatest Hits release something of a downer.Although the ""Carpet Crawlers"" re-make- featuring Peter Gabriel & Phil Collin's momentary reunion- isn't too bad, it's not quite enough to offset the clipped `tunage. If you want this particular track badly enough, go for the CD-single instead."
2,WHAT IS THIS?,"i am disgusted by this cd. yeah genesis was good but what made them good can be summed up in 5 words. peter gabriel and steve hackett. these two made genesis and they lost a lot when they left. this title is a bad intro to the band. if you want real genesis buy ""the lamb...."" and even though they are phil era ""wind and wuthering"" and ""trick of the tail"" great albums."
4,good trimmer,"I've had a number of beard trimmers through the years and have had a beard since about '94This one is really cool because of the levels of trim available.The only thing I dont likeis the read out of the legnths , its very hard to determine what it is."
4,Worth it For Carpet Crawlers Alone,"Turn It On Again: The Hits is essentially a collection of the songs that brought Genesis to the forefront of pop music. While these songs are all quite good, this collection doesn't exhibit Genesis' best work. For the most part, behind every song that made it to the radio or on a single, Genesis had an album's worth of arguably better (although less commercially appealing) songs. It makes sense that a collection like this should contain the most popular songs but a few less commercial songs could have been sprinkled in here and there to help introduce people to the band. Regardless, the real selling point here is the new version of Carpet Crawlers featuring Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford and Steve Hackett. It's definitely worth the price of the collection."
4,A 2 CD Set or 2 Separate Volumes Would Of Been Better,"I guess they should of released one cd with Peter Grabriel in vocals to please the earlier fans and another one with Phil Collins on vocals. Those songs became more commercially sucessful but not musically superior. I wouldn't know that since the only Genesis songs I heard singing Peter Gabriel are the ones on this disc and those are among I like the least on this disc. Mama and Congo could of been replaced by better songs. I guess when the band selected which songs were going to be on the disc, too many of them were from We Can't Dance because that's last good album they released; about eight years before this disc, and Invinsible Touch twelve years before. [It's bad] having a short term memory."
3,Missed again.....,"Why can they not figure out how to get the song ""You Might Recall"" on a current release? I believe it was only offered on the U.K. version of ""Three Sides Live."" It is one of their best post-Gabriel recordings."
4,Goooooooooooo Phil!,"This album is very, very good. The only song that isn't that great is ""That's All"", but I'll let it pass. ""Turn It On Again"", great song! So is Invisible Touch! I love the editing on Mama, it's very good. Lots of great editing. This is a recommendation for new fans, or for old. This was the second Genesis album I got, and it turned me on to some other albums. If Domino was on their it would have been perfect."
4,Not complete but still enjoyed it,"As a 20 year plus fan of Genesis I agree with most of the comments regarding that this compilation lacks the contributions from the early Peter Gabriel years. Having said this though I still enjoyed this collection. It's like comparing a BMW to a Corvette, both make a great sports car and I would love to have both!"
4,"""Carpet Crawlers"" - Say no more","The only thing wrong with this album is that they stopped short in not recording more Gabriel and Collins sing alongs.Carpet Crawlers is perfect and worth the price alone, but I would like to have heard a couple of more duets. If ever a band should re-unite for mini-tour it is Genesis with Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett joining the talented fivesome. (Yes, I do consider Chester Thompson and Daryl Sturmer to be as much a part of the band as Tony, Phil, and Mike)."
3,Genesis is back!,"As a life long Genesis fan, I found myself slightly disappointed with this disc. My favorite Genesis songs: ""Mama"" & ""Abacab"" appear here in edited versions, which is a crime! It's like watching ""The Godfather"" on Network T.V. As with any Greatest hits package there will be heated discussions as to what should have been included and what could have been left off. ""Jesus he knows me"" over ""No reply at all""? Please! Also, none of Genesis' classic longer tunes are represented here. On the plus side, the remake of ""Carpet Crawlers"" is awesome! To hear Peter and Phil harmoinize together again, even just for one song is fantastic! Trevor Horn does an excellent job of producing since Steve, Mike & Tony ""mailed"" in their tracks. The CD does flow very well with classic songs as ""Follow You, Follow Me"" fitting in quite nicely with ""Invisible Touch"" etc. This disc is great for the casual fan. If you want Genesis at their best, buy ""Genesis"", ""Duke"" or ""Selling England by the Pound""."
4,Great songs!!,"This cd is great fun!! There were a couple of songs that I wasn't familiar with, but I now love listening to. I'm so glad that I purchased this one!!"
3,????????????????????????,"Genesis were a fine pop band in the 80's but harmless and predictable, sure. But this release totally overlooks their most important work i.e 1970's art rock with Hackett and gabriel etc.Hopefully a boxed set of that era will be released in the future as it would be far more interesting and representitive of the real Genesis music. I mean in 1000 years time will Genesis be looked upoun as one of the Michalangelos of music? Not if this is how they want their legacy to be perceived. I mean they release 17 albums and they include 5 tracks from the invisible touch, one of their weakest albums???Its a bit of a joke. EDIT: My mistake there is already a boxed set from Genesis available 1967- 1975. Clap for a dummy?"
1,A collection off songs that I can't hear anymore,"The hits are there, but if you want the best, search somewhere elsebecause the best tracks on Genesis's albums haven't been heard on radio.For instance, the best cut of Duke is Duke's travel - Duke's end, so what you have on this cd...of course Turn it on again and Misunderstanding.Another example maybe ? The best on ""Genesis"" album is Home by the sea - Second home by the sea, so what you have on this cd ? Of course, you get Mama and That's all. So again, if you want the hits, this is the one, if you want the best, don't take this one !"
1,"Collins Shmollins, Pop Genesis with a touch of Lamb","All praise the number one artistic sell out band. While their 1980s-1990s music has a sound it never to me to the ""New Jerusalem"".Save your money, better yet buy Selling England by the pound, Trespass, Foxtrot, Nursery Crime, or Lamb lies down on Broadway"
1,gotta be kidding me !,"When I saw the song list my immediate reaction was ""you gotta be #@%$^&*@# kidding me !!""This compilation almost totally ignores their most glorious albums by far : their first 7 albums from the 1970'sSelling England by the Pound, Trespass, Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot, The Lamb, Wind & Wuthering, Trick of the Tail.These albums are to die for. Forget the 1980's stereotypical pop, as played by countless other bands.Their first 6 albums were unique, unforgettable masterpieces. Check out the website [...] whichrates the best 100 Prog (progressive) rock albums of all time : at number ONE is Selling England by the Poundand at number 4 is Foxtrot. I rest my case."
1,Not a good cd,"Genesis went from making great albums like The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, Foxtrot, Selling England By the Pound to pathetic trash like Invisible Touch and We Can't Dance. Where is Watcher of the Skies, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, Firth of Fifth, and Supper's Ready. IF THESE ARE THE HIT WHAT ARE THE MISSES?"
1,Phil Collins Greatest Genesis songs,"Avoid any ""greatest hits"" package. Especially this one. Greatest hits compilations are utterly disposable because if you find that you like most of the songs, you'll want to buy the full CD they came from thus wasting you're money on the greatest hits set.If you're a fan of Phil Collins-era Genesis (whom ""Turn It On Again"" is centered around), I suggest buying Duke, Abacab, and (far behind...) Invisible Touch instead.It's strange that there are no hits with the classic Peter Gabriel-led lineup. I guess Watcher Of The Skies or In The Cage could not be consider as ""hits"".The last song (Carpet Crawlers 1999) is available on CD single and is an excellent remake.In summary, don't waste your hard earned money on any greatest hits CD let alone this one.[DW]"
1,Genesis sucks!,Everybody knows the only good thing that ever came out of Genesis was Phil Collins' solo career! SU-SU-SU-SUSSUDIO!
1,Too many stupid songs and not enough good ones,"That's All, Jesus he Knows Me, Invisible Touch??? These are stupid songs. I Know What I Like and Carpet Crawlers are the best songs here. The rest is junk. How did these pathectic songs even become hits?"
4,Needs to be 2CD's,"Being a longtime fan, I must be honest and say that the only reason I bought this was because of the great new version of Carpet Crawlers. It justifies the price of the CD alone. But any hardcore Genesis fan will no doubt agree that there should be a two CD package that would enclude the best of the Gabriel era as well as some tracks from Trick of the Tail and Wind and the Wuthering. I agree with another review that said the edited versions of ABACAB, TONIGHT, TONIGHT, TONIGHT and MAMA are hard to listen to without feeling dissapointed that there's actually 4 or 5 minutes cut off. The good thing about this hits CD is that it does show that even though Genesis stopped being a progressive rock band in the 80's and 90's they still came up will alot of great songs and still produced some of the finest thoughtful pop songs of the past two decades."
5,"The Hits, an important part of Genesis career","After the departure of Gabriel and Hackett, Genesis' sound changed drastically, from the complex pieces of progressive rock to a more commercial-pop sound. Whatever the direction was, Genesis had success as both, a progressive band, and a pop rock band, and they showed that they can create good music, commercial and not commercial. This collection may lack some of the most brilliant pieces of the progressive era, such as ""Firth of fifth"" or ""The battle of Epping forest"", but it includes all of the band pop hits, which makes it the only album that casual fans may need, and a sampler of the pop era of Genesis for the progressive-Gabriel era fans."
3,Missing *all* the hits,"I have been waiting for a ""Best of"" Genesis CD for quite a while. I think the choices on the CD are quite good, but I think they should have released a two-cd set to include ""no reply at all"" and ""taking it all too hard"" and other missing songs. It's worth the $$, but it really could have been worth it with a more complete selection."
2,Not if you're a fan,"If you are a fan of Genesis, pass on this greatest hits comp.Abacab and Tonight are the ""radio friendly versions"". The mix for Mama is way off from the rest. Very little Peter G. featured.The new remixes of classic tunes are lame."
2,very average,"while Phil Collins is catchy and talented this hurt the band in the long run.The Peter Gabriel Genesis was more risk taking.Phil&crew just do commercial style music.it's not risky.Tonight,Tonight,Tonight&Invisible Touch are catchy but don't hold up.if you like radio hits this is for you."
5,excellent!... but there could have been more,"This is a very good collection. A couple of problems though. First, it could have been two or three discs easily. Second, and I don't think anyone has mentioned this before, but the order they have the songs on the disc is not great. I would have liked to have seen cronological order personally. As a whole it is good and will hopefully take you down memory lane."
3,My New Years Wish,"I've been in love with this band since Trespass, and I think the new ""Carpet Crawlers"" is wonderful. Phil and Peter's voices sound so good together that my wish for the year 2000 is that they would a take a ""Music Vacation"", and like some do with baseball camp, revisit a musical place together that will bring back some great memories, and create some new ones, for their sake and ours.."
2,"Not really the ""greatest""","It's difficult to put together a greatest hits collection for a band that has so many of them, so I have to applaud the effort, but this CD falls very short. Many songs are lacking - No Reply at All, It's Gonna Get Better, The Lamb Lies Down..., Home By the Sea, Illegal Alien. They're tossed aside in place of very questionable entries, such as No Son of Mine and Jesus He Knows Me, which I wouldn't call hits, just throw-aways the studio released to let the public know Genesis was still around. This band lost credibility with ""Invisible Touch"" (some feel it was earlier), going for Top 40 stardom and sacrificing their musical creativity.This CD could easily be expanded into a double-disc set, including more work with Peter Gabriel, complete versions of the songs (instead of radio edits), and definitely more instrumentals (especially The Brazilian - the only high point of ""Invisible Touch"")."
2,Genesis- The Hits,"I am not really impressed with this CD, the contentnor the sound quality, but perhaps die-hard fansof the band will like it."
3,great but not spectacular,"having being a fan for almost 15 years. I was looking forward to a greatest hits package. However the powers that be decided to take all of the songs this group made famous with the pop listening public and try and sell some cd's. I would say if you are the casual fan this is a good collection. If you are diehard, you have all of these and it is probably not for you. I do think the new version of carpet crawlers is good and I think that it is a good preview of the new Peter Gabriel solo album. Could of left off Congo since not too many people bought the album ""Calling all Stations"". Otherwise I would reccommend it for the casual Genesis fan"
4,"If You Want Peter Gabriel Songs, Get A Peter Gabriel CD!","I have been reading many of the reviews of the long awaited Genesis greatest hits CD and am tired of all the whining about the lack of songs from the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis. Genesis became popular after Peter Gabriel left the band, so there should be no surprise that there aren't many Gabriel tracks on the CD. I believe the CD is a nice compilation, although I would have liked to see ""Paperlate"", ""Man On the Corner"", ""Illegal Alien"" and ""No Reply at All"" included and the uncut version of ""Mama"". Probably the best approach would have been to have two greatest hits CDs, one from the Gabriel era and one from the Phil Collins era, but I think the record company would know that the former would collect dust on the shelves. A good CD for the casual Genesis fan."
3,Like chocolate pie without the whipped cream,"Most of these songs are great cuts. The selection leans toward the pop stuff of Genesis, except for a couple of Peter Gabriel led tracks that are out of place. There are a few cuts that were left off that should've been here. I guess with a catalog as extensive as Genesis' it's hard to make a greatest hits collection that isn't a box set. The title of ""The Hits"" is a little deceiving in this one. I suggest buying all of their CD's, and burning your own favorites CD."
3,Incomplete collection,"Why on earth would the record company choose to include ""Congo"" (post-Phil Collins), while excluding ""Man on The Corner"" or ""No Reply At All?"" While ""Congo"" has a nice ring to it, it was far from a hit."
5,Greatest Browns Book Ever!,This is the most complete and best written Clevelaqnd Browns book ever! A+!
4,"2 phase release 1 CD is a good 70's J.R. hits, other is his peers compilation","For the Jonathan Richman fan, this is one disc worth getting. However, the second disc is not necessarily at all what such a person may be interested in. I bought the Spitballs and Beserkley compilation albums in the 70's and never found them worth listening to again except for the Jonathan trax.If you can get one of the other 3 Jonathan 70's hits CD's instead of this one, feel free. Yes, this is an excellent collection of his hits from the 70's. But cost wise, I'd only get this if you find it to be cheaper than the other hits CD's packages he has available.The other bands on disc 2 are really not worth owing if you ask me. Some ernest rock from the S.F. region in the 70's but I can't remember much of it standing out. If you can use the 'listen' option to try some of those songs I highly recommend you do before you buy this 2xCD set. chrisbct@hotmail.som"
3,Jonathan Richman and the Theme to Shrek?!?!,"Has anyone noticed that the theme to Shrek is almost identical to the riff from 'Egyptian Reggae' by Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers?Mr. Richman, if you are reading this, my fee for bringing this information to you is just 7.5% of whatever you get out of DreamWorks!Best regardsIan Nicholson"
4,Had to buy this book after reading Ordeal,"About 30 or 35 years ago I was going to buy this book. I picked it up and then put it back on the shelf back then. It was after I read Ordeal that I got curious about this book. It is very obvious to me that Chuck Traynor wrote this book and those were more his thoughts. I figured this out just by reading a couple of sentences in the book. I enjoyed the book. It was interesting to read; however, I did not find this book sexually stimulating. I didn't like the energy that I was feeling as I read this book. It was an interesting book though. I read it very quickly."
1,Not really Linda,"This was not written by Linda Lovelace, but by Chuck Traynor. He makes it sound like it was Linda, but if you've read Ordeal, you'll understand that the real Linda did not believe anything which was in this book, nor did she consent to the pictures which are part of it. Not recommended at all."
2,This book is a waist of valuable reading time.,"This book is a big disgrace to the Dr. Who World and waist of valuable reading time. I got so bored reading this book, on many occassions I fell asleep while reading. The reason why I continued reading until the end is that I did not want my money to go to waist. I enjoyed seeing Iris' return, however, that did not even spice the book up. This book sadly lacked a sense of direction in it, and should be recalled from all book stores where it is sold."
3,Too Much Shift of Focus,"Frankly, this book is a trifle boring. And, not to contradict my esteemed fellow readers, but the follow up, The Blue Angel, is worse. There is entirely too much shift of focus. Too bad, really, because Iris Wildthyme could be such a great character. Her TARDIS also breaks the pattern by not being dimentionally larger on the inside than out. All in all, a poor read, or poor handling of a great character. Quoth the Raven..."
1,Possibly the worst book I have ever read!!,"Dear oh dear, this book should never have been printed. The setting is childish. The characters are immature and unbelievable and Iris Wildthyme is just plain annoying. As for the eighth doctor... well, not too bad, but it didn't feel like Paul McGann. If anyone intends to read this book I suggest they stop at the blank line on page 98. Before that I quite enjoyed the desert setting but afterwards the events descend into a greatest hits compilation of cliches. If you'd stopped after 98 pages it may have been an OK book. As it is, I'm afraid, it's overlong and boring."
3,robbed by the price and intentionally deceived by the description,I enjoyed the material but felt robbed by the price and intentionally deceived by the description. Most of this book is photocopies of old out of print boxing manuals and this book does NOT present itself as such because of this it is over priced when Kinko's charges less for photocopies. Further investigation that is all this author does is sell over priced photo copies!!
3,Crazy and a fine writer,"An enjoyable read. Cope is indeed a strange charector, but, perhaps surprisingly, he is also a fine and lucid writer. He comes across as crazy,wild, self-absorbed, intelligent and likeable. I thought Reposessed is the better of the two included books, as he matured as a writer."
3,"Not is best, but Ellis is always interesting.","I regard PREACHER as the best thing that every happened in the world of graphic novels. Ennis is a macho romantic, with enough sense of humor to take things only serious to a certain level. I wish I could give 3,5 stars."
4,German hip-hop at its best,"Surely for american hip-hop heads he is unknown but he had a collabo with with the smut peddlers released on rawkus but only in germany included one remix and one new track.The E.P Haus und boot in englisch , house and boat got a lot of different styles even turkisch raps of course there are only 5 tracks but this CD features the elite emcees of the german underground scene.Fresh beats something new. Worth to check out!IV STARZ"
2,where have all the communicators gone?,"For a book on communication and trying to overthrow stereotypic thinking and gender misunderstanding, the author fell into obvious pitfalls seen in non serious pop psychology books. Even a look at the cover -- with a woman trying too hard to look like a man leaves me cold. Surely, if the author really is female, the book could have shown a clearer understanding of real feminine psychology to enlighten us all. Not psycho mumo jumbo. In a word, zzzzzzzz, yawn."
2,disappointing,When I read the editor's note I immediately got and read a copy of this book. I am more than disappointed to say that it is yet another poorly written rehash of the communication problems between those in the workplace replete with unrealistic platitudes on how to solve them. Read Keaton's book on communication for actual substance on this dilemma.
1,superficial at best,Yet another attempt to dissect the gender equality and provide answers. This time with not the quality of thought or substance that went into the Mars v Venus books. Skip the imitation and go for the real thing. Not worth the room it takes up on the bookshelf since it has little substance and is full of cliches.
2,"Same Words, Different Language ... Another Book?","I first met Barbara at a Women In Technology conference several years ago as she offered a keynote on this very same topic, and found her to be remarkably bright ... but what I can't escape in reading this book is the overweening sense that it isn't breaking any new ground. It seems to me that we were discussing these very same issues in more dynamic form back in the 1970s, when Betsy Lehan Harrigan's ""Games Mother Never Taught You"" became my mentoring bible on communication between the sexes. I'd really like to like this book more, but just can't get past its very ""white"" take on women in the marketplace."
2,sex differences is much better,"If you are looking for a more thorough and entertaining presentation of this subject I would suggest Pesce's why men don't listen. I found this ok but rather dull compared to ""What could he be Thinking"" by Gurian or trite compared to Mealey's ""Sex Differences"". Ok to read otherwise."
1,uninspiring,Nothing original here. The author lacks the flow and the more complex ideation of Inglehart. Yes modernization has changed traditional sex roles and is reflected in business and communication but Annis does not reflect any new work in this potentially fascinating arena. It is a quick read but felt more akin to watching the preview of a movie than delving into the substance of this real problem.
2,doesn't live up to its potential,"The target for this book purported to include an audience of everyone who lives with or works with the opposite sex indicating to the buyer that this book should be read by everyone to assist in the communication problems between men and women. It shouldn't and it quite simply does not. I was disappointed to read a trite but quickly read book that justified and provides quick solutions to contentious and tough issues between people. The book lacked a more sophisticated analysis that this subject deserves. Instead it was a breezy read, superficially attributing hurt feelings and communication hurdles to gender differences. I would pass on this and look at Gender differences in communication by Dr. Kay Payne if interested in a more thoughtful and hard hitting analysis of this subject."
2,not on a xmas like for an avid reader,I am just a housewife and confess I don't always understand these things. This was way easy to understand. Maybe too simple in its appraoch. Not worth the price tag. I finiashed it without the practical tools I was promised to carry away with it. A few anecdotes to try and make the author look knowledgable but I was left unimpressed for whatever that is worth. My used copy is for sale - very cheap.
2,recycled material,I am usually a fan of books that examine the differences between the genders. Unfortunately this book is the same tired cliches and offers nothing new; nor is it particularly well written. Go to Dr. Phil or back to the Men are from Mars books for a comprehensive original discussion of the communication gap between men and women.
5,Shreiks of delight!,"The always literal-minded Amelia Bedelia helps out at her local library and in her typical fashion gets into tons of trouble by doing everything by the book! (Like making wonderful jackets for the books and actually dressing them up in lovely, stylish little garments!) Every mix-up that could happen in a library is there in true Amelia Bedelia style.Of course, all's well that ends well, and the library has a wonderful contribution to the big parade, impressing the head librarian who is not, after all, a ""know it all who has been around forever."" (Why, she's not even the dinasour that Amelia was actually expecting.)This will be a classic!"
3,Not as amusing as some others,"Amelia Bedelia's visit to the library includes some unintentional misadventures, as all of her books do. How could she know that the book jackets the librarian was talking about didn't have sleeves and buttons?In this book, Herman Parish does not seem to have quite the touch that his Aunt Peggy did. Some of Amelia's misunderstandings are quite awkward. For instance, when the librarian says she wants Amelia to be so quiet that she could hear a pin drop, Amelia THROWS her pen to the floor, making a loud noise. Amelia apparently mis-heard pen instead of pin, but even then, why couldn't she just drop the pen?Because of the awkwardness, the final product is also not as funny as some earlier titles."
3,St. Peters,I always liked historical documentaries. It runs in the family. I remember my dad and I watched a documentary on the Vatican a while back and St. Peters always looked like an interesting place to visit.
4,The Almighty were Almighty!,"This disc reminds me of good old Zodiac Mindwarp, just a little heavier. Powerful chord-based power metal. This came out back when you could just look at the cover of a disc and the photo of the band and know that you were getting heavy music. Leather, tattoos, sunglasses, jewelry, and you knew you were in for a treat. They got a little weaker with their releases after this one."
4,Beautiful & Classic,"My dad gave me these earrings as a present when I got into college, & I absolutely loved them. As a jewelry maker I'm extremely picky, but I only found a couple small issues with them. The backings are a little loose so they sometimes feel like they're going to fall out. Also, the sapphires are a little too opaque. At the same time, both of these problems might just be with my pair in particular. They're actually bigger than they seem & look pretty big once you put them on. All in all, a great gift at a good price. I think most women would be very happy with them, I am!"
4,Great quality,My mother in law is sensitive to certain kinds of metal. Cheap jewelry has caused an almost allergic response in the past even so called genuine gold. My mother in law loves these earrings and wears them all the time without a problem.
5,Best cover around!,"I take this cover with me when I travel acroos the US of A. It protects my Road King from rain, bird crap and tree sap. It is heavy, will not rip with normal use, does not leak, and is easy on and easy off. It packs away small to carry in its heavy storage bag, with room to spare for my rain suit. I also have one for my Sporty - I've had it for years. Great cover. Buy it!"
2,Olivia's Foreign Hits,"I listened to ON-J when I was growing up, and looked forward to getting her GREATEST HITS. Since it is close to 25 years ago since I last heard her, I do not remember very many song titles, and so did not know what to expect. Only three, I HONESTLY LOVE YOU, IF NOT FOR YOU, and IF YOU COULD READ MY MIND were worth listening to. The rest were big in Europe, not here(for example, COUNTRY ROADS is a John Denver song and it is difficult to believe an Australian singing about West Virginia). Too, why make a big deal over some songs she did that others did even better(ANGEL OF THE MORNING, for example)? I know she has better songs out there. For folks in Canada and elsewhere, this collection might be right up your alley. For those in the US, no I do not think so."
1,terrible,Speakers started smoking after about 5 minutes. they didn't sound so great when they worked. Sent them back and got the Lanzers. which sound great.
2,Not So Much,"These ""subs"" are really nothing more than 6 inch plain old speakers. I put them in a small sealef box that is sold here on Amazon. The box and a pair of coaxial 6.5 round speakers might sound pretty good, but as a sealed sub box, it is totally lacking. I think if I were to try 6.5 subs again, I'd go with nothing less than some Kickers."
3,Great deal,"I cut this into the rear deck of an older accord and I am using it as a free air mid/sub. Sounds great but it does have its limits, though for me the limits are probably due to the lack of a properly sized box. 09212012 The rubber Surround tore on me. I dont want to completely fault the speaker because as I stated I am running this without a box."
1,"I Agree, This Line of Product Deserves Minus Five Stars","I have yet to fix a single cd, dvd, or video game disc with this piece of junk. And they didn't even have deep scratches. They were just superficial scratches that prevent the disc from working. Save yourself the time (believe me you will spend a lot of time buffing and polishing after the actual grinding process), energy and money by simply buying a replacement cd, dvd or video game. I hope that others will learn from my mistake."
1,You must never buy This product.,"I had the skip dr. the one with the green repair disk,This product is nothing compared with it. It stops the wheel just stuck into itself and happens a lot. could not use it very well we will try the other versions."
4,Tried Once With Success,I've only used it once so far and it worked. I had a badly damaged CD which wasn't ripping well and this product made a huge difference. I gave four stars for being overpriced and cheaply made. The bottom line is that it did save a CD which I thought was a lost cause.
1,Don't bother,"I bought this product to repair a DVD of my wedding ceremony. I only had that one copy of the ceremony, and it was badly scratched. So I bought this DVD Dr. to fix it. Now, it's unplayable. It completely ruined my DVD. i can't even watch my own wedding, and I certainly can't share it with long-distance relatives. Thanks a lot DVD Dr."
3,Barely average but okay if you liked Relic,"I only read this because I liked the audio version of Relic. After finishing the whole thing (> 400 pages) I was a tad disappointed. There are a few good moments but I wasn't frightened much and how many times can best-selling authors use the phrase ""After what seemed like an eternity,""? They also repeat figures of speech used in Relic to the point of making it almost a clone. Pros: the characters are good and likeable cons: ending is a let-down, sluggish in the middle, Pendergast is too knowledable (what DOESN'T the guy know? it caused me to lose the feeling of being immersed in a believable environment), etc. etc.The twist in this book did catch me a little off guard but only because I wasn't trying to figure out the plot while reading. I tried to just enjoy it.So, I think if I could go back in time, I'd skip this one."
4,Crichton for Dummies,"This is the second book my these authors I have read. Interesting plotline, and characters. Moves fast and keeps you interested. Along the same lines as Jurassic Park, except you don't have to think as hard. The ending to this one was a bit of a stretch. But when you just need a thrill, it hits the spot. Looking forward to Ice Limit, Thunderhead, and Cabinet of Curiosities."
3,Where the heck is the creature?,"What?? No Mbwun?? No red-eyed-half-hairy-half-scaly-tooth-and-claw-weilding-death-machine?? As good as the characters and setting were in ""The Relic"", the real secret of its success was the monster. And now it's gone. All your favourits--Margo, Pendergast, D'Agosta and Smithback--are back and as good as ever, and the new setting in the subway is perhaps even more effective than the first time (if that's possible)... but I worked my way through half of the book waiting on the flipping creature!! Even with the added plot element of trying to stop the plant escaping into the oceans, it just doesn't have the same va-voom as before. Still a cut above the rest in the horror genre, but not as good as the original."
2,Starts off promising but slowly fades away,"I quite enjoyed Relic, so it was with great anticipation that I began to read Reliquary. The story starts off promising. There is an air of mystery and suspense that continues to build. Perhaps this is the problem. The authors do such a good job of building atmosphere and preparing you for the climax that when it finally comes, it can't possibly live up to your expectations. Instead, when it does come, you're left feeling cheated, as though the authors did not know where else to turn, so they took the trite and easy way out. A far more interesting read would be a non-fiction work about the real ""Mole People"", the forgotten homeless of New York's underground."
2,VERY disappointed!,"For those of you who read Relic and have not yet read Reliquary. It is a sequel of poor quality. I am a huge fan of Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston. Reading Relic was a terrifying experience that kept me on the edge of my seat and scared at every turn. Reliquary fell very short of my expectations. I kept waiting for it to get scary! It never came close to the anticipation I had built up knowing a sequel had been written. If you want scary, read Relic. Don't bother reading Reliquary, though well written, it paled by comparison..."
5,A Good Read,"Reliquary by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child is the sequel to Relic. Reliquary is an exciting book. It is realistic science fiction. You won't be able to put it down. I sure wasn't! Reliquary is staged in New York City, above and below-ground. The book is mature in its themes. There are many scientific terms and ideas. There are many characters ranging from the underground community leader Mephisto to FBI Special Agent Pendergast. A drug from a lost village transforms people into a legendary creature that craves a chemical in the human brain.This causes a killing streak in New York City. The drug called ""glaze"" by its users is a plant is grown by a former scientist in a reservoir. If the plant hits the saltwater, it will activate and potentially ruin the world's ecosystem! Find out for yourself! You do not need to read Relic first, the first book of the series."
5,INTENSE!,Part two in a two part series. I didn't think the first book's plot could be topped but I was wrong. Intense and hard to put down book.
3,Move-like story telling,Probably 3 and a half stars if I'm being honest. With the way the action unfolded I felt like I was reading a movie script which made some parts a little predictable. I still enjoyed the story and look forward to reading more books by this writing team.
4,Couldn't Put It Down,"I never read the Relic, but saw the movie and enjoyed it. So, I couldn't help but pick up the sequel. It was fabulous. A great beach read. The ending was disappointing but it didn't bother me to the point where I was disappointed I picked it up. The ""mole people"" storyline fascinated me."
4,Reliquary,This book is typical of the intensity and mystic writting of Douglas Preston. He has many twist and continues to engage the reader with his story of the unexplainable that he bring to the real world.
3,C.H.U.D. meets Re-animator,"If Relic was the movie Alien set inside a museum, Relquary is C.H.U.D. meets Re-animator. You have cannibalistic mutant homeless people living below the streets of New York, a mad scientist, a nosy reporter, etc. The hero agent Pendergast is even more of a superhero. This is a second rate thriller too derivative of 1980's B-grade horror movies, with a superhero - Agent Pendergast - added."
3,Where be there monsters?,"In the heart of men, as this book shows. Less a monster novel than a straight forward beat-the-clock suspense thriller with some rousing action scenes, readers expecting a return of the hypothalawhatchamacallit eating mutant will be sorely disappointed."
3,A good sequel to Relic,"A very good sequel to Relic.When you finish up the 1st book,you have a feeling that there's still unfinished business,and here,Preston and Child picked up the momentum and bring us another chilling and worthy continuation to the story."
4,Terrifying,"No, it's not as good as 'The Relic' as everyone isn't tired to say. But it's very close as I must add. 'The Relic' was wonderful, so it was very hard for the authors to write another one with the same topic and make it new. But they did. The descriptions of the underground and the people living there is very interesting and not exaggerated. It's real!As one already said, if you wanna have at least one reason to read this, it's because Pendergast is there again."
3,Standard fare,"I loved the Relic but didn't care nearly as much for Reliquary. The evil creatures in this book stay in the shadows for literally the entire book. We only get glimpses of them interspersed throughout, which is disappointing. The descriptions of underground New York, a city most of us will (thankfully) never see, make this a worthwile read though. Easy beach reading, but not a must read."
4,Don't Take the Subway,"As with anything, the sequel has a hard time living up to the original. This is true for RELIQUARY. However, I was quite reminiscent of Margo and D'Agosta from the new story. They still held their own against an old, but new, threat and I did find myself gripping the armrest a few times. I became a bit jaded with the mole people underground, but was not dissapointed with the climax of the story. I think it would be wrong to say this sequel did no justice to the RELIC. You should feel at home back in New York City with Preston and Child's monsters to welcome you."
2,"Realistic, but a real snore fest.","When I read the first relic book, and the summary for the second book, I really wanted to get it. When I checked out Reliquary, and read it. I was horribley dissappointed. I thought it was going to be another scary Preston and Child book, with another Mbwun monster loose in New York city. It would have been a great book. But instead of a terrifying monster, they had a bunch of wrinkled up drug addicts in the underground. And the ending really disappointed me, it was really surprising though. Wait until paperback. Dont waste your'e money"
2,Starts off well and then degenerates into absurdity,"I am a big fan of The Relic, both the book and the movie. Therefore, I read with great anticipation the sequel Reliquary. The first half is really interesting as the mysteries begin to unfold. But it ultimately disappoints by leading to a ridiculously over the top and absurd ending, including the obligatory wipe out of an elite military unit (in this case, Navy SEALS) and the Wrinklers sacred ceremonial hut of skulls. Preston and Child acknowledge Jennifer Toth's book The Mole People as the inspiration for their depiction of the tunnels beneath Manhattan, but in the Author's Note they seem to take everything in Toth's book at face value judging by their recommendation of it. I have read several reviews by people knowledgeable about subway tunnels and so forth and they dismiss Toth's references to the miles upon miles of abandoned tunnels and the decaying waiting room complete with piano and mirror lined walls as sheer fantasy."
2,basically it's the Relic minus the originaltiy and suspense,"I don't know why all these people are raging about this book, it was all I could do to read it through to the end. The interesting things about the Relic (the museum setting, some interesting characters, some suspense as to origination of the moster) were ALL missing. What is left is the same old characters that don't seem nearly as interesting as 1st time (the neophyte NYC scuba diver was the only person I cared about and he is only in it at the beginning and end). The mutants are not as scary, and one would think the setting of lost undergrount tunnels of NY would be eery but really not that much of the book takes place there and it is still only a fraction as interesting as the Museum setting of the 1st book. All I can say is don't believe all the raves. If you want a good no-brainer suspense yarn, try the Cobra Event."
5,"Exxelent book, Better than the Relic!!!","The Relic is one of the best books there is, but Reliquary is even better. Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child ar at their best with this book. The plot is well thought out, and leaves suprises until the very last chapter. Mbwun is a great character, a true monster, and even though it is not very realistic, it gives a new definition of watch your back on those narrow alley ways. This book is very creative, and the sub plots keep you interested during the entire book. 381 pages well read. Keep it coming!!!"
3,"Good, but faults keep it from getting more stars.","Reliquary is good (though if you havn't read the first novel then you should read it first) but it's not really that good. One problem I am beginning to notice with the Relic books is what I'm beginning to call the ""Relic Sydrome."" It's basically that in the book, all the characters who are primary characters are always right, and those who aren't are always wrong. Another thing, when the Monsters wiped out the team of Navy SEALs, I was on the verge of throwing the book away. Relic did the same thing with the SWAT team. I simply don't understand how an FBI agent, an overweight Detective, a bum who hasn't seen combat since Vietnam, and a Museum Scientist can kill tons of these creatures, while a team of highly trained Navy SEALs gets slaughtered in a matter of moments. Ending didn't have nearly as much impact as the first one either."
2,It ain't The Relic,"With the heart-racing, action-packed, rollercoaster-ride that The Relic was, it's a shame that what could have been a great sequel fell flat. What's with the sewer people? How can you go from an underground hybrid monster to a bunch of deformed sewer people? How scary is that? New York City has thousands of them! I like Preston and Child's writing, but Reliquary lacks the suspense, horror, and non-stop action of The Relic."
4,"Good story, but a bit over the top","A great plot, lots of interesting places and characters, but my what a mess it creates. It pushes the limits of credibility pretty hard. But I had a lot of fun reading it. To read in time order, read after Relic, but before Mount Dragon."
4,Good Read,"If you liked Relic, Reliquary was good continuation. This is the 4th book I have read from Preston & Child. I have not been disappointed!"
2,very dessapointing,"Even when the plot and the suspence of the story are just fine, it seems that the characters stroll until the middle of the book to find out just what everybody already knew at the end of the movie. If you really don't have any other horror book to read and you love the simple recollection of facts taken from different magazines, this could be your choice."
1,Dumb,"I agree with the other reviewer that ""Who they used for the ""bad guy"" in this one was absurd."" When that identity was revealed I simply stopped reading right then and there. never read any more of the series. never read anything else by the authors. Just too dumb. I enormously enjoyed the first book, but this one just pulled the plug for me."
2,Good idea that just becomes tiresome.,"Considering that they were starting off with some good material, ripped off from Relic, this could have been better. Eventually it became weak enough and absurd enough that I gave up."
1,"Just bad, worst of the series","After reading all the books in the series, I'm used to the ridiculous endings and contrived plot twists, but his one had all that plus some tedious action sequence that couldve been left out. The only things that redeemed this novel just a little were the descriptions of the underground tunnels and the Pendergast character.Who they used for the ""bad guy"" in this one was absurd. It just wouldn't be possible for him to have kept what he was doing a secret, especially from those who'd worked with him in the past. This book was a real let-down. There are a few books in the series that are better but, unfortunately, for context it helps to have read this one first."
5,"reliquary doesn't surpass relic, but is a worthy sequel","Relic and its sequel remind me of alien and aliens. In the first, you have a thriller about a single creature that seems to be unstopable, while in the sequel, they are dropped left and right, with a larger emphasis on action. That's not to say one style is better than the other. Reliquary has all the techno-jargon you've come to expect from preston and child, but unlike Michael Crichton, they are horror writers at heart. and horror you get, with equal amounts of suspence and gore. Occasionaly, the characters fall a little close to stereotype, with a cool professional FBI man and a street smart NY cop, but do not compromise the story. If you want a satisfying thriller, you can always count on Preston and Child, I'm waiting eagerly for the next one, guys!one last note, If you have only seen the movie of relic, read relic before you read this. Otherwise the story will be paradoxal to say the least."
4,Very good read,"Very good fast flowing read, action from beginning to end interesting subject matter about the homeless people in New york"
2,overdone,"So much was repeated from RELIC. I felt that reading the first book was wasted. Having been born and raised in New York, some of the characters where completely unbelievable. And, by the way, there is no #9 Central Park South. If there were it would be located in the park just south of the zoo!"
4,Reliquary,"A great sequel to Relic. I just love that the book is exploring my home town underground. I can almost visualize what the characters are doing. A great read and I really like the characters D'Agosta and Pendergast is so unpredictable they match well.You are absorbed into an unknown sub culture of people living in underground railroad tunnels and long forgotten tubes, pipes and levels.The book flows from the original Relic with a twist that is very unexpected. Enjoy New York in the dark if you dare!"
5,A Worthy sequel,"Relic was one of the best ""horror"" books I have ever read due to its synthesis of a good plot line, characters and fantastic action (much better than the movie).This followup is almost as good though the novelty of the story is missing. The underground world of the Mole People and the way in which the supposedly upright researcher becomes entangled with the story makes for an excellent read.I only wish there could have been another one to follow."
4,Another scare!,"I saw this book at Walden Book Store and I had to get it. Again, another great scare! But I liked the firt one better. I mean this is a great novel to read but the Relic, I will never forget when I first read it. So people, it is okay to read the novel if you want to, but believe me, you will think the first is better. The first is always better."
1,Cannot Touch the First One!!!,"Since I loved ""Relic"", I was very excited when I saw ""Reliquary"". Don't bother reading this one. Rehashes things from the first book -- gives you ""revelations"" that were discovered in ""Relic"". The characters weren't fleshed out -- very two dimensional. And the ending.... RIDICULOUS!!!! The only thing I liked about his book was the fact that Pendergast plays a more central role, and I did like him. I had to force myself to finish this book -- maybe I shouldn't have, I would probably have liked it better if I didn't!!!! Read their ""Mount Dragon"" if you liked Relic. MD is not as good, but definitely better than ""Reliquary""."
4,Suspenseful,"The Reliquary was a great book. If your'e looking for a suspenseful, fascinating novel about the underground of New York City. Most of the facts surrounding the mole people of New York City are true, so it made for an excellent read. Unfortunately I never read The Relic, so i'm not getting the full effect of the book and its meanings. I definately recommend this book."
5,Second part of a great ride!,Who would have thought that they could keep the story so seamless and exciting! All my guesses of who was behind the story were all wrong! Can you figure it out?
3,Doesn't quite hit the spot,"While I really enjoyed RELIC, I didn't find myself feeling quite the same about Reliquary. I liked the way the book started out, I liked the premise of the book and thought it was interesting, and as always, I enjoyed Pendergast and D'Agosta. Unfortunately, I felt that there were way too many subplots. There were too many different people doing too many different things. It got distracting at times. If you liked Relic, you will probably like this book, but don't expect it to thrill you quite as much."
4,I Like it Better than the First!,"I am about half way through this book and like it alot better than the first (though I recommend reading the first to get an appreciation of the characters). It is a lot quicker paced and a whole lot less predictable than the first. The underground society is so fascinating and makes one wonder if the authors have experienced the life first hand.The characters are interesting and well developed. In the first book too many characters were thrown at you and it was difficult at times to distinguish who was who.At this point in the book we still don't know enough about the main characters though. I would like more information about how the main characters (Margo, D'Agosta, Pendergest, Frock, and Smithback) grew up.I am also glad that the authors decided not to use the same beast from the first novel but instead a variation."
4,Cool book,"I enjoyed ""Reliquary"" about the same amount as ""Relic."" It had action and adventure in it. I liked the creature in the first book better though. If you've read Relic, I'de reccomend this book. If not, read Relic first."
4,Freshen your breath!,"I love these little mints! They are a quick freshen-up of the breath and the mouth. They are packaged in convenient little packages that fit most anywhere. I have a package stashed in my car, my purse, my other purse, my coat pocket and in my drawer at work. I prefer these to chewing gum, as they are little and last just long enough.Try 'em!1smileycat :-)"
4,Correctional Law for the Correctional Officer,"Well packaged when delivered. The book was mandated reading for the Corporal's exam. Helpful information, it reads easily, though as one might expect, a little dry. Of course, I doubt that it was written for casual reading. But definitely a good book for supplemental law enforcement."
2,Correctional Law,"Book was not the edition that appeared in the picture when I ordered it...so it was not the one that I needed or wanted, or for that matter ordered."
3,Don't fit my 2012 Chevy Equinox that Great,"I got these for my 2012 Chevy Equinox. The mats themselves look really cool, I wish they would have fit.They left like 4 inches of uncovered space on my floors. I ended up giving these to my girlfriend for her Volkwagon Golf... they fit better for her :-).I got weather-techs and will never look back. Totally worth it.Pros-Look coolCons-You kind of have to guess on whether or not they will fit your car. Didn't fit an equinox.-They moved, not enough grips underneath mat.-Didn't hold water, don't get for winter weather."
4,Would be better for a car.,"Bought these for my 07 Trailblazer they are good quality, but don't really stay in place. Keeps mud off the carpets. I think they would fit in a car a lot better."
2,Great product in a bad housing,"We have owned the Oxygen 3 upright for 3 .5 months and it is falling apart. Although well designed and powerful, it is way too heavy for the plastic housing. The rear cover has broken off, and so did one of the wheels. The plastic connections for screwing the wheels on have sheered off. We love the features, design and power, but are now very wary about how much time will be needed for repairs."
1,Not what I was expecting,"I ordered this ""book"" based on the strength of the other reviews, but I found it sorely lacking. First of all, it's really more a pamphlet than a book. Second, it is poorly published. The publisher did not clean up the spelling mistakes, and wrote everything IN UPPER CASE, which is annoying to read. But my biggest beef with this ""book"" is that the pictures are of such poor quality, I cannot believe that anyone would recommend them the way they have. I'm all for believing in fairies, and I don't discount them offhandedly, but if you want to see pictures, this isn't the way to go. I would want the author to come up with pictures that have more pixels, that are clear, that are printed on good paper. This ""book"" looks like it was printed on someone's cheap home printer, directly from their computer.If the author is such an avid photographer, can you get some better reproductions of your pictures?"
3,The age of the book and the place of original appearance make it contextually too odd for most modern young readers,"As a long-time devourer of adolescent sports fiction, I have read many books with a wide variety of themes, quality and approach. The best of the genre has action you care about and a message about life and fair play. This collection is no exception although the messages are a bit more pronounced. Each story originally appeared in the official Boy Scout magazine ""Boy's Life"" in the time period 1935 through 1948. Therefore, they express the mindset of literature at that time, the boys are all clean-cut and in the rare cases when they appear, girls are generally props.Therefore, the stories will most likely be of little interest to the modern teen-age reader, they deal with a society that has passed by. Most of the stories will be so contextually odd that even when the action is interesting that interest will be dampened."
5,Fathers and Sons,"This is a DYNAMITE memoir. It explores the complex relationship between fathers and sons, the way even our best intentions can lead to violence, wounds both physical and spiritual, and, in the face of all of that, the improbable, redemptive quality of love. The writing here is beautiful. After reading this book, I came to see my own father differently--in a way that hadn't presented itself to me before. For me, that's what good writing does, it twists our lives around and shows them to us in a way we hadn't thought to see them. Lee Martin's memoir does just that. It is Highly recommended."
3,A good read.,"I read it, and I liked it. However, I would not give it more than three stars simply because I doesn't merit a four or five star rating. Think about when you rate a hotel, restaurant, movie, or play, you rate these things based on your enjoyment/entertainment for what it costs. This is the same way I rated this book. It was good, but not the absolute, hands-down best out there. From looking at the other reviews, it seems that most of the reviewers are the author's friends or neighbors(look how many are from Texas), hence the five star ratings. Be honest. It is a good read, but don't be swayed by the pretentious few."
5,An Example of the Grace of Memoir,"Lee Martin is a writer who cares greatly about exploring the intricacies of human nature and our relationships with others. He gives his readers a compelling story of his struggling relationship with his family as well as his own self. I, too, am a former student of Martin's and am sorry to see that another reviewer misunderstands and misrepresents Martin's true vision, not only as a writer, but as a teacher. If you want to experience a master writer who brings the complexity of emotions and actions of a family trying to live in the sometimes lovely and sometimes harsh space they've created, then read this book."
5,A touching story that helped heal my heart,"From our house is an incredible touching story that helped heal my heart. Having grown up in that rural part of Illinois that is the backdrop for this loving and honest tribute to a real family, I was able to put myself into the setting and heart of this story. The struggle of Lee's family due to loss and how they survived is ispirational. The love that inspired the book was strong enough to overcome the harshness that was a young boy's life. The descriptions of the time, area and the local characters were so incredibly accurate that I found myself in Sumner again, a child spending time with the loved ones who have passed on, smelling the smells, hearing their voices and seeing life as it was. An incredible book from truly gifted man."
2,A disappointment,"This book looks like it covers a lot, but it really uses a lot of words to cover very little and I found most explanations more confusing than in other books I had read. After reading some sections I felt like I knew less than when I started. There are an awful lot of small errors also, such as referring to a backbone as ""background"" in one figure. I definitely don't feel it's worth the price."
2,Scratches after just one week!!!,"I WANT to love these plates, I really do. They are beautiful. But for this price, and considering the glowing reviews and statements about the ""tough glaze,"" I expected them to be more durable. After just ONE WEEK of regular use my plates have deep visible scratches. How will these look in years, which is how long I want them to last? On the positive side, this so far does not seem to be a problem with the white, but regrettably I am going to have to return the red. This color is lovely but won't look that way for long unfortunately."
2,hard to read,"I ordered the original of this book, by mistake. It is extremely hard to follow the thoughts of the author. Way too many ""thine"" and ""thou"" and ""thee"" and ""thy"" and ""ye""... you get the picture.I would probably recommend the updated editions... just for friendlier reading."
3,Lack of page numbers is the only reason for the three stars.,"One of my favorite books passed down from my mother. This one of Roberts' books seems to have a direct connection that has spiritually and psychologically helped me through many situations. I don't get the same sense from the other books by Roberts, so this one stands out above the rest for me.That being said, again I have to take issue with the Kindle reader version of this since navigation is severely limited by not including page numbers. I bought this Kindle version because it was half the price of the Sony version and then, because of this major flaw in the Kindle design, rebought it from Sony. From now on, even if the price is higher, I will buy the Sony version whenever available. Having page numbers and easier navigation because of them is worth the price."
1,not what I ordered,I ordered this book from Atonabooks for a Christmas gift and they sent me a dog earred used paperback. They will not do anything about it either. Amazon did everything they could in talking with them too. Don't buy from this company.
2,"Pales in Comparison to ""God Calling""","Please check out ""God Calling"" instead! There's no comparison between the two, except that ""Come Away My Beloved"" seems inauthentic in comparison. ""Come Away My Beloved"" is one person's imagination about what God might be saying, while ""God Calling"" is an authentic representation of what God's saying. Trust me on this one!"
5,Great Devotional Book,I have Frances Robert's other devotional book. It is just as good as that. It encourages you to have an intimate walk with Christ and challenges you to walk closely with Him and trust Him.
5,A Faithful Companion,"I received this book after my husband died in 2002. It has been a constant comfort and strength for me for 6 years. I used it for daily devotion every day until recently. When you are walking in the valley of the shadow of death, pick up this good companion with God's love song to you. And eventually, you discovered that you can sing again."
5,Reviving your spirit...,"Come Away My Beloved is one of the most sacred and beautiful books I have held in my hands. A masterpiece? Not necessarily. But Spirit filled? Absolutely. The tiny book is packed with the Lord's promises and truth that Frances Jay Roberts so perfectly communicates in a understandable way. As you read this book, you will feel like the Lord is speaking directly to you, forgetting that a man is behind the pen. (but yet, hearing from God.) This was given to me as a gift a couple months ago, and I have already bought it a couple times myself to pass onto others. Young, old, new, or mature believer-this book can speak in individual, life impacting ways into the souls of anyone who loves the Lord."
5,what a blessing!!,"This is an absolutely awesome book written by someone who was obviously yeilded to God during the process of writing it. I know I will re-read it for the rest of my life. I will also plant this seed into the lives of others.Hearing the voice of God in these pages has fed me, comforted me, healed me, challenged me, blessed me, and opened my eyes as no other book has done.My relationship with God has changed. This book has helped me to have an incredible desire to seek Him first, always.This book will meet your need to know God and understand what He wants from you. You'll hear from Him, trust Him and fall in love again."
2,Exercise your eyes all day,This kit suggests that you do 13 exercises that take 10 to 45 minutes each. This comes to about 3 hours of eye exercises every day! I don't think that this is realistic.
2,Too time consuming & Inconvenient,"The information in this kit is excellent & I did learn a lot about how vision really works and how we can improve it naturally. The author includes a lot of great items in the kit such as eye charts, a book, audio CD's, and cards with all the different eye exercises.HOWEVER, after adding up ALL the time it would take me EACH day to complete all the exercises, it would have been about 3-4 HOURS OF EXERCISES EVEDRYDAY!!I understand that natural vision improvement is something that involves a lot of dedication every day, but I'm sorry I just simply do NOT have this much time EVERY DAY to dedicate to performing the different eye exercises. Additionally, I felt that some of the exercises were poorly explained and were difficult or confusing to perform, therefore I do NOT recommend this kit. I am purchasing a different eye exercise book that got excellent reviews therefore I hope to have more success with that one!"
3,yellow glow stick,This product is not yellow. more of a lime color. it will serve the purpose though.
4,the signs of greater things to come!,"A Pagan Place is light years ahead of the debut Waterboys, but not yet at the heights they would reach on This Is The Sea. The early sound of the band is formulating nicely, with some very strong songs here - the title track DEMANDS your full attention! The re-issue is essential for hard-core Waterboys fans who must own this for the full, unedited versions of The Thrill Is Gone & All The Things She Gave Me. The sound quality is much better on this disc than the original. The previously unreleased tracks generally are 'interesting - for collectors only'. However, great thanks go out to the people involved in making this re-issue - is there a ""This Is The Sea"" reissue coming?"
3,Entertaining movie,Enjoyed watching this African comedy. Interesting cultural content.Couldn't wait to see part two. I hope there will be another in this series.
5,It`s a very well written book.,"I think it`s a very fun book to read.While I was reading this book,I could see the characters in my mind.I really liked how the authour described the scene where she saw her freinds on the street trying to intergrade the high school.I really enjoyd this book."
4,"An excellent book, puts a new perspective on predjudice.","Look through the eyes of the little rock nine, a group of black kids integrating Central High School.It's a book full of adventure and saddness. I reccomend this to anyone who wants a better look at how far we as a country have really come.It's very inspirational, showing you that you can get through anything with determination. Find out what it was like to be put down by your community and what courage really is."
5,Terrific!,I have not read all of it. But my teacher started reading the first few chapters and I would already gve it five stars! My teacher stoped reading it because it was to heavy for some kids! I can't wait to finish reading it on my own!
4,The story of the nine who intergrated Little Rock Central High,"Eagerly, Melba gazed past the guards on the first day of intergration. She was excited beyond question. But one thing kept her from liking this school. Mobs of angry Whites were gathered outside the school and were cursing and threatening the nine black students. One mob chased after her threatening to hang her. See what she does to survive a whole school year with all the harassment.This book sparked my intrest on intergration. It tells the true story on how Melba Beals could survive such brutal conditions. It also intrested me with the descriptions about the main events. The only downfall to this book is that Melba rambles on and on about many things. She repeats certain things in every chapter making it redundent."
3,What I think about this book.,This book is a very good book and tells a true story about how African-Americans were treated in the past.This story tells how nine African-Americans high school students were treated during segergation.They are treated really bad and are chased out of school almost everyday. This book is for adults because of the vocabulary and the way they talk about people.Anel G.WOK
5,love it,"I Love this book , I recomended this book if somebody want to read from back on the fifty really interesting. And also was new and cheap I love it"
5,Good History Read,"This book is a great read if you every have wondered how someone made it through intergration in the 50's in Little Rock, Arkansas."
4,Warriors Don't Cry,"Warriors Don't Cry was an intriguing book. Melba Pattillo Beals writes this semi-uplifting and depressing story about her and the other eight black students that integrated into Little Rock, Arkansas's Central High School in 1957. Melba goes through mental and physical abuse from the other white and black students. This book represents the human spirit greatly because of Melba's unwillingness to give up and either transfer out of school or commit suicide. She shows great perseverance throughout the year and comes out on top. The abuse Melba suffers during her year at Central High would push any normal person over the edge and probably commit suicide. The kind of mental torture Melba goes through is just unbelievable. I would recommend ""Warriors Don't Cry"" to anyone over the age of 11.Written by An 8th Grader - 9-22-09"
5,Warriors Don't Cry,"We are coming up on the 50th anniversary of the integration of Central High in Little Rock. This book is written by one of the courageous students who braved a racist mob to claim the equality and justice we are all promised in a democracy. The photographs of one student, Elizabeth Eckford, facing the abusive and threatening crowds became iconic, part of history and public memory. What is not as well known is what life was like for the nine students inside the school everyday. Everyday they were threatened, physically attacked, suffered abusive language and attitudes from the white, segregationist students. The author, Melba Patillo Beals, is an extraordinary writer, storyteller and she is blazingly honest. As a way of celebrating July 4th, read this book and give it to every young person over the age of 10 that you know."

2,Poor quality book,"I needed this book for a summer reading project for my son. The local bookstores were all out but I was lucky enough to find the book on amazon. The book arrived quickly. The shipping cost was a bit high. Once my son started reading it, the pages started to fall out in clumps. We now have several piles of pages for him to keep track of. I don't know who you complain to about the binding of a book but I don't think I will risk this seller again. On a good note, he is enjoying the story."
2,Hated to hate it.,"Yes, I did not like this book. I feel like I should have, it's a great memoir of Melba's trials and tribulations while integrating with the rest of the black students into the school, but I couldn't bring myself to like it. I just could not stand the way it was written. It seems to fall into such a repetitive cycle of self-pity and ""things will get better, oh wait, they aren't"" that I started to not care at all. The first half of the book held my attention and my emotions, but as it dragged on in it's repetition I just felt less and less. I know she wanted to write about everything that happened to her to show how bad it was, but I feel like if she had cut back on things and just focused more heavily on certain events that she did include that it would have better held on to my emotions than being continually bombarded with incident upon incident until I was numbed into a state of not caring."
2,Repetition Galore,"Melba Pattillo Beals' ""Warriors Don't Cry"" was amateur at best. While the purpose of the memoir is inspiring, Beals just appeared to be a broken record.Upon reading other reviews, I thought this memoir was going to be heartbreaking and inspiring. Yet as I began to read, a pattern developed. The book dragged on and on yet there seemed to be no progression. I found myself void of emotion throughout the whole recount. Needless to say, this was a disappointment, and extremely poorly written."
1,Boring,This story was quite boring and and the author lacked the ability to make the reader want to keep reading. I definitely do not recommend this book.
5,I really enjoyed this book,"I thought that the book was excellent. I had to read it for a history class at Florida State University and just loved it. It is very depressing, but it made me look at myself and my own prejudices. I really would like to thnak the author for having the courage to write this book. I look forward to reading her other books."
5,Powerful and Painful,"The narrative of Melba Pattilo Beals and the Little Rock 9 is a powerful story that should be read by all who can read and understand it! I especially recommend it to relunctant readers. Every page offers something rich and rewarding as we are immersed into life as it was during this movement. The struggle for a quality education and the abuse that was suffered was difficult to read about but, the determination and courage of the youth were simply incredible. This is a time that we can not afford to forget. The vocabulary is simple enough for most middle school readers and the text is lively enough for a read aloud as well. Read it, I'm sure you'll come away all the richer for it!"
4,A Roller Coaster Ride,""" I think the story had an interesting and important plot. The plot was a true part of history and I feel that that makes it more important and more intersting. I think the main character's, Melba, best tarait was how she never gave up no matter how hard things were. I think the book would have been a bit better if kids were able to relate to it more. Otherwise, I think it was a really good book. It's like a rollarcoaster. Parts of it are like going up the hill and then you fly down when your stomach's still left behind. I strongly suggest this book to people who enjoy reading about things that really have happened but aren't like old textbooks."""
5,Heart-Wrenching,"I thought this book was difficult to read, but quite necessary. It was eye-opening for me to realize that so many people were violently outspoken and in their opposition to integrating public schools. The battle is not yet over as so many cities in America have yet to fully integrate. As a matter of fact, many cities have chosen to not even attempt to make schools equal in terms of facilities and qualified staff (read Savage Inequalities by Kozol). Thank God for the strength these youth had to endure such a nightmarish experience and the courage the author had to write about it."
2,BORING!!!!,"This movie starts out alright, with some good chase scenes and a few shoot-outs, but then it just becomes incredibly boring. Detroit 9000 becomes so slow paced, that it will put you to sleep.SNOR-FEST.....ZZZZZzzzzzzzzz"
2,doesn't live up to the hype,"After seeing a preview in a theatre of this re-release, I was intrigued, mainly because it didn't have any of the usual '70s black action stars (Fred Williamson, Richard Roundtree, et al) in it. I though maybe this was The Great Lost Blaxploitation Film. I was wrong. It's just not that great. It's got a good plot and good intentions, but a mediocre script, some remarkably gratuitous scenes of violence and nudity (even for this genre) and atrocious acting by everybody except the two leads (who struggle valiantly but in vain) keep this on the level of a cheap made-for-TV movie. Sorry, folks, it just doesn't live up to the hype."
2,Amusing - good for a laugh,"I happened across this one in the university theatre a month or two ago. It's definitely worth a laugh, and would make for an amusing evening at home. But greatest on foot chase of all time? Give me a break.You'll probably enjoy, as I did, the made-more-than-a-little obvious racial tension. I sure did. And I'm a honkey."
1,an unknown reason for selling a sorry item,"Unable to understand why am I sold an item that knowingly cannot be played on my dvd.I feel like I've been robbed, and nothing will be done about it! This is the 4th piece of garbageto be sold to me!"
3,My opinion,If you are a collector of blaxploitation films add this DVD to your collection it is the basic blaxploitation film nothing really great a few actors/tress that people may be familiar with if you grew up in the 70's;however it was made by Quentin Tarantino and I am not a big fan of his. I like maybe two movies that he made.
4,Size 4,"Fits pretty good, I have a beagle mix and it's a little snug, I probably would have been happier with the size 5."
5,Just Because You're Paranoid.........,"......Doesn't mean they aren't out to get you. So wrote Mark Twain many years ago and Jack Dunphy, the main character in this book, becomes a believer very quickly. Jim Hougan is half of the husband and wife team which writes under the pen name, John Case, and as such they have written two very good books and one which I have recently reviewed, which is not up to their earlier standards. However, on his own in this effort, Hougan more than carries the day. It is a fast paced mystery-thriller which leaves you wondering how much that is revealed therein, may be more fact than fiction. It will leave you satisfied that you have been told an interesting yarn, however as you scan the newspaper you may see stories that will make you wonder if all that is as it seems. To tell you more would spoil the fun. Read and enjoy!"
4,Re-Released,Loved the book....but it was re-released as The Magdalene Cipher. You should know before you purchase.
5,Entertaining Gripper,"Hougan combines a smart, entertaining style with suspenseful, fast moving plotting to produce an extremely enjoyable contribution to the spy genre. It's not the usual Clancy-Patrick Robinson-Di Mercurio ""rah rah"" America type (and I happen to love the Clancy et al. ""rah rah"" America type)...this is more in the vein of Le Carre, except it moves much faster, has an unusual point of view on the spy business, and is cleverer, in my opinion. Give this one a go...."
4,An Interesting Book!,"This book was a tad different from your usual spy novel.Our hero Jack Dunphy gets demoted when a subject he has under surveillance is killed. Through his new job he runs upon some deeply hidden secrets that the C.I.A. wants no one to know.This leads into a wild journey for Jack and his girlfriend Clementine. They wind up in Sweden at a secret C.I.A. compound where many stunning secrets are stored. Dunphy ,after his hitch at the compound is forced to go on the run. Every knid of phenomena onearth has been done by the C.I.A. The existance of a secret society is also brought to light. Buy this book and you will be treated to an interesting read."
3,"Interesting plot, average book.","The spawn of Christ is a neat idea, but the book surrounding it has been done often & better by several other authors. Not bad for a first time author though, considering how many other terrible books get published ever year."
4,Get your Enterprise Architect to read this NOW!,"As a consultant that's worked for a few big companies that are doing EJB Architecture, I'd like the Architect read this book. Then maybe they would put down the ""golden hammer"" (EntityBean) and pickup a useful tool. There is too much bangging around with those expensive hammers.Good book - and I could relate to the adventure stories that open many chapters - I found them interesting and pointed!"
5,Outstanding work,"I agree with previous reviews. It is an outstanding work. I didn't know that the apocrypha books like Enoch also had such wisdom. Richard combines a collection of resources and his analysis is superb. If you thought the book of Jude was a flyby book, think again, it is a book for the matured, some of the truths in there are solid meat.This commentary book remains my standard for a good commentary book. A tough standard to follow."
4,Funny,Trent Reznor helped produce this spoof of Closer to God and it has the satirical wit of a Teacious D Song
1,god must hate us all,Please don't get this cd. It's a waste of money and very boring. The only thing they did to this song was make it in to a hillbilly depression movement(not a pretty sight). If you like boring spoofs of good songs buy this but if you are a real NIN fan please run away and don't come back.
5,excellent,"I did not know the full history of the glider pilots. Now I do, and I am impressed and awed by their unselfishness and heroics. Everyone interested in WWII should see this documentary."
4,Great introduction to WWII gliders,"WWII was the only war in which gliders were used in combat on a large scale. For a variety of reasons (mostly the practicality of helicopters) these aircraft are no longer needed but for a time they represented one of the best ways for delivering troops behind enemy lines and the ONLY way to deliver light artillery and other ""heavy"" equipment needed by airborne troops.This documentary inlcudes archival footage not just of US operations but also German operations which shaped American interest in the glider as a weapon. There are also interviews with glider pilots who served during many of the campaigns in Europe and elsewhere. A great film and well-worth watching."
4,How did I miss this before?,"This book was referenced in another book that means a lot to me, but I never checked it out. When I re-read ""In the Eye of the Storm"" by Bishop Robinson and recognized how this book impacted him, I decided to check Amazon on the chance I might still be able to read it and understand its impact on Bishop Robinson. Now I do understand, and I recommend it especially to anyone in the LGBT movement, especially any like me who are devout Christians, in order to understand our mission and purpose in this world. There are few copies left, and it may never be republished, so anyone who thinks it might be important to read should take this opportunity!"
4,Solve your blender's problems,"Our Cuisinart blender started to labor and make unpleasant noises. Inspection revealed that the blades weren't turning freely. Attempts at lubrication with WD-40 improved things for a while, but it was an ongoing battle.A replacement blade assembly solved the problem, made it work like a new blender again.I think the mistake we made before was putting the blade assembly through the dishwasher. I believe this dries up the lubrication and shortens its life. From now on, rinse and air dry."
5,blender,blade cuts through what it needs to do if your previous blade was destroyed in an icy anquish
1,What a RIP OFF!,$45 for the blade/gasket assembly !?!?!? You could buy TWO blenders for this price! And the Cuisinart CBT-500 is NOT WORTH IT either !!!
3,"Cute idea, problems though","The on/off switch is hard to press. This is for 3+ yr. olds. My almost 3 yr. old couldn't do it at all. Switch is located under a velcro flap and two sets of wings and the flashlight sometimes rotates inside the dragonfly's body, so it can be hard to find also.Also, the one we got was apparantly defective. The light dimmed out after only two weeks. New batteries din't fix it, neither did a new bulb. It just died.Finally, we would be willing to try one again, but it seems to be on backorder of unknown length."
4,Good resource,"I'm planning a family reunion and have poured over several books on the topic. Krystal Williams did a very good job with this one. It's highly superior to the book by Donna Beasley because while it's full of warmth, charm and inspiration it also has more details on the nitty gritty of the business side of reunion planning. If you can afford to buy more than one reunion book buy this one or at least check it out from the library. It's an excellent starting point."
3,Funny at times,"The Classic Slum, is a good piece of historical writing for its intended audience the facts are present and largely have to be accepted, although given the means to validate them, I expect they would be accurate. Roberts writing has been clearly limited up to the time of his parent's death, which seems to have been a definite decision on where the book should end. By using this limit effectively and creating some fascinating dialogue Roberts has succeeded in writing about a dreary Salford slum in a light and sometimes-funny way...."
1,Unhelpful,"I recieved this book as a gift and thought the title sounded interesting. I am a professor and have to deal with students as well as other faculty. I did not find anything helpful in the entire book. Most of the advice was along the lines of ""can't we just get along."" There was little info on how to actually accomplish that."
1,AWFUL!!,"Not only is this author's writing style simplistic, so is the content of this book. This author's approach to problem solving is pathetic, at best. Inbetween the author's attempts at writing is an overabundance of quotes. If you're looking for a place to waste your money, buy this book."
3,Hmmm,"Well, I rated this a 3-star because the book STILL hasn't grabbed my attention. It is a rather boring start..."
2,"OLIVIER MASSET-DEPASSE, OPUS 2","What's interesting to observe in this film is the way the director manages, with a subjective point of view, to transform a documentary into a fiction. Now, is the presentation of such elements as the suicide of one of the asylum-seekers or the character of the Russian mobster challenging enough to turnIllegalinto a great fiction movie ? In my opinion, no. The movie is instructive yes and also fascinating sometimes but let's just call it a documentary with a heart. Already forgotten. Unfortunately."
2,Disappointed,"Gal Costa only sings 3 songs, the rest is sung by Jobim (he's great). But, ""Samba Do Aviao"", not sung by Gal or Jobim is VERY bad redition (out of tune, probably a relative). Anyway, this should not even be on the CD....really, really bad."
2,Bad Recording,"Although this is a stellar line up of musicians, the recording is terrible.Don't waste your money."
1,not enough information from amazon,"I had to return this item because it was not what I needed. It is not compatible with SPSS 11 and it did not state that on the Amazon page, it also didn't state the major limitations of this product. If you need to be able to run lots of data or do certain types of functions it will not work for you. If you are in a graduate school psych or sociology program, this will probably not work for you. Go to the manufacturers site and read the specific specifications for this program before buying it."
1,Very disappointed,"Beware - if you buy the student version it is not big enough to run the files necessary that you work on in class. Nowhere did it indicate on the Amazon site that it had limits of file size. Wouldn't one assume that if you are selling a ""student"" verson, that it will be able to run your school files? Don't buy it if you are a college student and need this software to complete your projects. I wasted $80 plus dollars. Didn't learn of its limitations until AFTER I loaded it, and when it wouldn't work found the limitation statement in the manual. Very disappointed."
5,SPSS 13 Student version,"I have tried for years a lot of demo, free and shareware related to statistics, econometric and data analysis software. It was good, tired, and finaly I choose SPSS, because has excelent tools, options and interfase to user. Not PC crashes, no unknown format files. If you no not have enough money, don't waste time and money, use SPSS Student version."
2,Maybe She Was Bored,"This largely stream-of-consciousness collection of journal ramblings isn't really bad, but it isn't nescessarily good reading either. Published on 2.13.61, Henry Rollins' publishing company, it suffers from the same general malaise that Mr. Rollins' work most suffers from, and that is a lack of the graceful act of self-editing. That said, perhaps it deserves respect simply for the very fact that in-your-face, self-published punks had the all-out nerve to just go ahead and do it. After all, Ms. Cervenka is certainly one of the originals of the lets-get-this-perfectly-not-too-straight movement. Read it for the anger and angst, if you must. And for the strange little drawings. But any teenager from the 50's - now in America could have done as well. If it's stream-of-consciousness that is being sought, stick with Ginsburg or Patti Smith."
1,Not what it seems....,"This is not death metal, this is not black metal, its just plain boring old metal, nothing special about this band at all. I think their Bruce Dickenson style session vocalist made it even worse. I can't beleave some people are calling this death metal, read the lyrics, listen to the musics speed and style - it has everything to make and album thats NOT death or black metal. I'm sure fans of metallica, limp buiscuit or some other garbage with rave this pile.Listen to real death metal - cannibal corpse, Nile, Exhumed, Immolation....Then listen to real black metal - Mayhem, Darkthrone, Enslaved, Dark Funeral, Ashes, Emperor....Now if you have/did listen to the above mentioned, try telling me that Garenian fits into the mentioned catagorize - YOU CAN'T!!!! If you can, you should get brittnay spears new metal CD as well....oops I Did It Again - its as black/death as Gardenian."
3,Tasty melodic metal,"Those familiar with the so-called ""Gothenburg Sound"" will know what to expect here. The music is crushingly heavy but with melody laden thoughout. Catchy tunes. The vocals are predominantly death to death-black growls. A second session vocalist provides some Bruce Dickinson-esque moments as well. Surprisingly, for an album that frequently includes clean vocals, the album is mostly straight-ahead melodic death and is less accessible than, say, In Flames' or Dark Tranquillity's latest releases.Not the most original material in the world, but if you, like myself, can't get enough metal (particularly of the heavy-yet-melodic variety), this is for you."
4,Not Quite What I expected,"Thought there were were shelf liners for the honey-do shelving. In fact, they are a thicker, sturdy construction. Used on top and bottom shelves for protection from dust."
3,Only the Beginning Basics,"You have to take the title literately. The book, although presented with color photos for every example, only covers the pure fundamentals, such as how to hold the bat, which side of home plate to stand on when batting, which base to run to, etc. These are all issues that need to be discussed and taught when working with the new ""tee baller."" But, for those volunteer coaches who might be looking for the basics of how to run a tee ball practice, or basic drills for the beginning ball player, or working with and informing parents who are new to organized baseball, this book stops short. I purchased the book sight unseen with no additional information on which to base my decision. I am writing this review just to educate others who may be looking, what is, and is not, included in this 30 page book."
2,Fred and Ginger should have had the lead roles.,"This would have been at least 50% better if Fred and Ginger had the lead roles. The story is one of the worst I have ever heard. The only good parts are the songs and dances, and even those aren't too good."
4,Thanx to Amazon for Finding this Gem!,"It's hard to see why a musical combo like composer VincentYoumans and lyricist Gus Kahn don't get more credit for beauties likethe rhythmic ""Carioca"" and the classic tango ""Orchids in the Moonlight,"" two standards people have been humming since 1933. Audiences went to see Gene Raymond and the gorgeous Dolores Del Rio, but were swept away by the relatively unknown Astaire and Rogers. And take a gander at Ginger Rogers singing ""I Like Music"" in a gown that barely made it through the Hayes office. This was one of the last times she would play the usual working-blonde smart alec before later films revealed her as the great artist she was. The plot is standard, dopey fluff from every 30's musical, but a cast of RKO old-pro's pull it off quite well -- right down to the silly gyrations of pudgy bathing beauties anchored to soaring biplanes over Rio. Get this while you can, it's a great piece of Hollywood history."
4,"Ginger & Fred steal the show - 5 stars, just for them!","All you have to do is take a look at the amateurish dancing in Hollywood musicals up until the time this pic was made, and you'll know why it's a collector's must-have. For the first time, the audience saw what REAL dancing was all about. Too bad Ginger & Fred didn't have bigger roles. In the opening scenes of the movie, look for Ginger doing a night-club singing number with a big-band backup. She just stands there in front of the microphone and sings a song, simply and quite well, in a costume that'll melt your picture tube. This scene and the dance number get all four stars, and they probably deserve more."
5,Used DVD but in near mint condition,"DVD of Flying Down to Rio was in top condition despite being classified as ""used."" The movie is a beautiful and humorous window into mid-1930s view of world, music and dance, romance and humor."
3,A Wild Campy Ride to Rio,"There is an innocent quality about this film. It is a fantasy, the props and air stunts are frequently camp, and the film makes no attempt to be even remotely realistic. But there is also a wild exuberance to the film and who is wilder than Ginger Rogers and Astaire while also being refined and expressive? This is a film where one has to throw away all pretense of critical analyis and simply sit back and enjoy the whole wild thing. Silliness has never been more engaging."
3,Sappy but fun,"This is a truly sappy musical; the sophistication in RKO musicals was a year away. But the film is a lot of fun, in large part because of the generally good music, slightly awkward musical numbers, the stunts, and the uncensored shots of lots of beautiful girls. Indeed, this movie may well have hastened the introduction of meaningful film censorship in 1934. Fred and Ginger don't, in fact, do very much together, but in retrospect you can see what's coming. As for stars Delores Del Rio and Gene Raymond: well, the silents are still haunting the talkies in the very early thirties, and here is a case in point. The scene on the beach after the forced airplane landing is embarrassing. That sort of thing would quickly disappear from the major studios. So sit back, relax, and wait for the airplane dancing scene. Sappy but fun."
3,The star is born,"While now everyone watches the movie to see the first pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, the movie is still a rather enjoyable adventurous love story. Strictly lightweight fare, the film still appeals to most audiences despite some rather highly improbably plot turns. The future of the Rogers-Astaire partenship glimmers brightly here."
2,glossy book with no real stuff,"This book is a mistake, Depth of field is shallow for this book :), all you get is 20% information from this book. you can pass on."
2,His usual style,"Most of his books have better than average images for illustrations, albeit they are mostly too small.My biggest dissatisfaction with most of his books is the content: they tend to be shallow and nothing very inspiring. Most of the stuffs he is printing in all of his books have been talked about elsewhere and hardly anything is new."
3,"Great for machinery, NOT anything else science fair related.","If you want to build a machine for your science fair project, this book is for you. It has detailed instructions on how to do it. This is a good, ""How does it work?"" type book.Read the title carefully though. There are no experiments in the book, no suggestions on how to present it, no suggestions on categories, or anything. The ""Make-It-Yourself"" is quite literal. It's not talking about science fair projects as a whole, only machinery."
2,100 Amazing Mistakes,"The ideas are great. The instructions are terrible. I have found so many errors in the book such as listing materials in the instructions which are not in the material list. The material list gives very little information such as which brand of mint box. The pictures and the instructions do not seem to always go togethers I have also spent many hours tracking down some of the materials due to the outdated supplies. The instructions do not fully explain things, such as which wire goes to the negative and which wire goes to the positive battery terminal. I want my students to experiment, but not to re-invent the experiment due to the poor instuctions. I have been very disappointed."
1,I kept finding amazing mistakes.,"I am disppointed in this book of poor directions and mistakes. The directions are not clear. The directions are not in proper order (we ruined a 6-volt battery because of the steps). The materials are not all listed in the material list in some of the projects. However, if you really want students to experiment and think, this book is it because they have to figure out what the directions really should say."
3,Good ideas,"This book has got a lot of great ideas! In my search for GREAT science books, I came across ""Science Is..."" by Susan V. Bosak. Check this book out for value and the years of use you'll get out it. Highly recommended for any classroom or even a teacher in training!"
2,Their marketing suckered me in again.,"I don't know why I always keep going back to Under Armour- I'm left largely unsatisfied with my purchases. To say it directly, the quality of their stuff just isn't all THAT great. At least not for the prices they charge. I got this for $12, which is fine, but much like their compression gear, it RIDES UP and NEVER stays in place. Ever.I don't have this problem nearly as much with other brands like Nike, Adidas, Reebok, and even stuff purchased at Walmart (Starter) and Target (Champion).The material of UA's products is too thick and smooth, so it's constantly riding up on me when I'm doing anything.Sorry, but UA seems to be more flash than substance, and that's coming from someone who owns a hell of a lot of it."
2,Too big!!!,"This skully is way too big for the average person. I am 6'3"" and 230 lbs. and it is still too big. The only way to make it fit better is to pull it down over the ears, which is not the way most people will want to wear it."
3,"""rebirth of slick"" was a rebirth","This album was truly unique. I had never really liked KUBE until I heard this song when I was fourteen, and that was all it took. Rebirth of slick was a breath of fresh air an I had never heard anything like it. This band is ahead of their time."
5,Very Digable......,"This album is chock full of anthem type songs that each would blow up if they were put out as singles. From the Jazz Club, finger snappin' coolness of ""Rebirth of Slick"" to the bass heavy street inspired grooves of ""Pacifics"". Mix in some modern hip-hop attitude with Jazz from the 50's and 60's and add some funk from 70's and what you get is this great album. Also inspired by beat-poetry this album doesn't fail to please. It is obvious that the Digable Planets were making a very concious effort to sound ""Jazzy"" with all the Jazz Slang, and the boehemian type interludes they made an image for themselves which they later regreted. Not as good as the album they would later record ""BlowOut Comb"" but still an essential and timeless effort from the now defunct super slick group known as Digable Planets."
5,One of the Best Hip-Hop albums of this Decade,"If you are fan of laid-back, smooth hip-hop ala De La Soul and Tribe Called Quest, then you definately have to own this album. An orgy of tight rhyming and expansive grooves, DP manages to lay the vocals down perfectly over mellow,tight beats. The tracks are all dense, flowing wordplays with numerous jazz samples and a plethora of funky sounds. This record is epic--buy it immediately."
4,dead but beautiful,The picture is beautiful I am planning on framing it and putting next to the velvet painting I have.
5,The Bend Experiance,Awesome book from a mountain bikers point of view. Plenty of facts and details make using this guide a no brainer. The info is very accurate and the choices are endless for rides of various lengths and skill levels. I never new how much riding Oregon offered(and Bend in particular)but this Book made the trip easy breezey as far as what to ride.
5,Mister 100 000 Volts,"Gilbert Becaud is a classic in France, believe me, I'm french. Although he first started singing during my parents youth, he is still on air. His songs are remade by young singers, they are classicals. enjoy the energy of the man who is called Mister 100 000 Volts. that's a lot!"
4,My all time favorite singer,I bought my first album mid fifties in Brussels where I grew up. Since then he has remained my all time favorite french singer song writer. I have most all vinyl 33's and am replacing little by little with the cd version. Gilbert Becaud is the man!
5,Sooo good!,I love John Anderson's voice and this cd has all of the songs I love!! This is a great source if you are looking for some of the songs from the last decade or so that you didn't originally buy! Good stuff! It is fun to dance to! :)
5,Instant classic.,"A tape full of unbelievably cool songs (ok, so maybe the redone ""Swingin'"" should've been left off) by a guy whose voice is wonderfully unique. Why it took me so long to pick up on his music is beyond me, but now I have his whole discography (thanks in part to Ebay) and will NEVER LET IT GO! He puts heart & soul into music like no one else. He's the greatest, and this CD proves why."
4,Great Collection Of Original Instrumental Masterpieces!,"Plenty of great songs here, ""Rumble,"" ""Miserlou,"" and ""Wham!"" to name a few. Some songs such as ""Tequila"" and ""Watermelon Man"" slightly challenge the definition of what a true instrumental is, but I forgive them, especially since they're such great songs. This is a superb compilation, and these are all the original versions of these gems. It's a good buy!"
2,Too much talk,"I read Haig's first book and liked--and still enjoy--the narrator/protagonist Drummond's DeMille-like sense of humor. But that book, Secret Sanction, ran out of steam and this one continues the trend. Funny, ... commentary but endless cliched dialogue and a plot pacing that drags. Too much talking, not enough honed description and action. A long version of JAG, except R-rated."
4,Excellent Thriller,"This is the second novel I've read by Brian Haig and I've already pre-ordered his third, ""Kingmaker"" (due out in early 2003). Mr. Haig writes exciting legal thrillers with a touch of humor. The hero, Sean Drummand, is a JAG lawyer with an unusual past (commando in a super secret Army squad). Mr. Haig is now one of my must read authors. Even though each novel stands on its own, my recommendation is to read them in order. ""Secret Sanction"" is his first book."
3,A politically correct legal thriller,"As legal thrillers go, I enjoyed ""Mortal Allies."" However, with the theme of the army's ""Don't ask, don't tell,"" I found it somewhat politically correct. The homosexuals were all earnest people who were somewhat quirky while the army officials, bureaucrats and South Koreans were elitist, bigoted and incompetent.That said, the true story behind the murder trial of an army officer accused of murdering his South Korean homosexual lover was quite interesting.I thought overall the book didn't portray South Koreans or South Korea very well. Too many of the characters throughout just seemed too one-sided."
4,Mortal Allies,"Book is engaging and fun to read. I hope insights into South Korean criminal justice system are highly fictional. Engaging but not terrific; I read it over a few days; Daniel Silva books I read straight through, non-stop. This is a cut below that level."
3,The review of the book. The Duping of the American Voter,"The book is one of the best on the topic of the media and the presidential election. I used it as a source for a civics paper, and it had everything that I needed. Spero can show his views acuretly and clearly with information to back his points up. I recomemed this book to anyone."
1,"The Films of Kenneth Anger, Vol. 2","The short films in this collection may have at one time been cool or interesting, however, I consider this purchase a complete waste. The visuals are of simple or stereotype images/characters and there is nothing cinematographically interesting -- not at all. I don't get it. Don't throw your money away on it."
4,Rising Anger,"Depending on whom you ask, the name ""Kenneth Anger"" conjures up any number of reactions. The author of the notorious ""Hollywood Babylon"". A devoted disciple of Aleister Crowley. A man who counts Dennis Hopper, Jimmy Page and former Manson family associate Bobby BeauSoleil amongst his friends. A provocative and influential film director. ""Kenneth who!?"" This collection covers the latter part (1964-2002) of the underground raconteur's astounding, nearly 60-year long career in avant-garde filmmaking. You may not know the name, but you've likely felt the influence. Watch 1964's legendary short ""Scorpio Rising"" back to back with Martin Scorcese's ""Mean Streets"" (just for starters) and you'll see what I'm talking about. Fantoma's handsome presentation features a nice booklet with essays from admirers Scorcese, Guy Maddin and Gus Van Sant, as well as wonderfully droll and enlightening commentary from the 75 year old (but still sharp as a tack) Anger. Essential viewing."
5,NICE!,"First off I would just like to say, that the packaging for this DVD is excellent. For a low price the DVD package includes a 5o page booklet with pictures and commentary for each film.Scorpio Rising- killer classic greaser footage captured right down to the engineer boots and leather. Lots of style and symbols are captured.Invocation of My Demon Brother- Ground breaking film work here. The sound track is creepy too. Psychedelic Hell.Lucifer Rising- very beautiful music as well as imagery. Probably Angers best work."
4,"Trekkies only, Please. Lots of fun!","This is a great illustration as to why history books do not dependably tell what actually happens; and the best we can do is reconstruct events of the past, and trust we have enough information to go on. Time travel, creatures from outer space, and simple human (and other creatures') error make the story difficult to understand, unless you start from the beginning . . . or rather, from where the story begins, which is the future. You see, ... Well, you'll have to start on page one."
3,Day and a Night,"Alternative to ""First Contact"" (movie). Vulcans arrive earlier and possible changes to Star Trek universe, could have been better written but still a good read. ""Strangers from the Sky"" can be read in a day and one night. Enjoy."
3,Excellent idea - poor execution,"The plot of the book is gripping - the first contact between Earth and Vulcan. What Star Trek fan wouldn't want to read about this encounter? Unfortunately, the book itself fell far below my expectations.Reading through it left me with the craving to know more details about what occured, but on all counts it was lacking. Oftentimes the writer's written style was cumbersome and frankly hard to understand. I found myself re-reading paragraphs in an effort to wrap my mind around a clunky sentence, and frequent shifts between perspectives with no warning only made it worse.Overall, there are parts of the book that make it worth reading, but be prepared to skim paragraphs and be left wanting more than the story offers."
2,Another in an overly-long line of mediocre Star Trek novels.,"This one concerns a first meeting between humans and Vulcans. It's hard enough to suspend disbelief in *any* time-travel story but this book, with its contrived plot and uninteresting characters, is completely unsatisfying."
3,A minor complaint.,"While the book is good, my problem with it is the new foreword by the author. She mentions that the book was written six years before the official first contact between humans and Vulcans depicted in the movie ""First Contact"" set in 2063 - wrong. That was not the first contact between humans and Vulcans in the STAR TREK universe. The TRUE first contact in the official cannon STAR TREK universe was depicted in the STAR TREK: ENTERPRISE episode ""Carbon Creek"" in which a Vulcan science vessel observing the launch of the Earth satellite SPUTNIK 1 on October 4, 1957, crashed and it's survivors had to interact with humans (the humans not knowing that they were aliens, of course) while waiting for a Vulcan rescue ship to come for them. A minor objection, of course, but MWB should have realized this."
1,First Contact rules,"Down with this book.Heck, the First Contact movie is ten times better than this book."
2,First contact or should it be?,This book tells the story of a first contact that should not have been. Vulcans arriving on planet earth before their time. An interesting book which is slow at times but does get interesting. It is a large novel which I found too much of a read to begin with but as the story progressed I could not put it down.
1,This book is serious!,"I figured this book had to be a gag. But, no, it is a serious book! What next?"
3,Better than nothing but not worth the Money,"I purchased this book, the day I bought the professional edition of Microsoft office for my XP computer. I had previously used, on occassion, Microsoft office for the Win95 system.I feel I wasted my $ on this book. This book is fine for someone who is new to microsoft office, but it is not a good investment for someone accustomed to using the intermediate level Que books-which I had purchased for microsoft office for Win95.I would never purchased his book, had the Q books been available to me, but I did not see any Que books on XP in April of 2002.this book is beautifully illustrated, and so if you are not a computer tech junkie-as I am, perhaps looking at this book will get you excited about computers of today. But I would not recommend this book to anybody but a rank beginner of Windows-esp the WinXP system, since this book does not address the advanced features of the program-which is why I bought the book."
2,Weak attempt from Curtis,"First off, I must say I'm a big Curtis Frye enthusiast. He has penned some extraordinarily helpful computer books in the past. But, quite frankly, this is not one of them. Not to push the envelope, but, Curtis I'm deeply disappointed by your less than helpful latest effort(if you call it that). I wanted to learn about advanced filters, HLOOKUP, And VLOOKUP in Excel, but came away learning absolutely nada. While the individual Step-by-Step books are great, this insipid collaboration failed to advance my skills, let alone help me one iota."
5,Fantastic Self Learning Tool!,"Way better than any of the ""for dummies"" series. This Microsoft product features color screen pages, easily understood instructions (that even my 85yr old grandma can follow) and the best part is learning just the parts or pieces of the programs that you choose at your own pace. Great buy! Arrived at lightening speed!"
5,Great-Must have book!,This book is great. It helps with any of the office products and is easily understandable.
4,You should view this movie twice,This film was dogged by most reviewers as being difficult to follow. It really has to be seen twice to see how everything actually fits together. Even better watch it twice and then view the commentary with the director and Dakota and Chris Evans. It is not a film you can watch while doing homework or really anything else. There are moments that help explain the story that flash by. I actually liked it a lot. It was better the second viewing as it became clear how the subtle little things all fit together. If everyone in the world had not given it terrible scores I would probably have given it 5 stars- but I didn't want to appear to be a complete dorky geek. Now that I have figured it out I prolly will watch it again in a few weeks just to enjoy the hand held camera shots.
5,PUSH,"I LOVE THIS FILM! This is about the government meddling in psychic phenomenon and abusing their power and their victims as well. The people of many abilities must try to get a mysterious package stolen from a government lab. Lots of head games in this and tons of super-normal action for action fans. Besides, Chris Evans without his shirt makes this one well worth the price of admission."
3,Fun to watch.,"Of its genre I'd place it right in the middle. Not the best acting but also not bad. There's a good story line here with lots of action too, and although everything works smoothly, and comes together nicely, there is an element of Pizazz! that's missing; I thought some of the supporting parts or the actors who played them weren't right for this movie; they were too layed back. I enjoyed viewing it though, found it interesting and fun, and would watch it again."
3,Decent watch!!,"Definitely liked the premise for the movie. I liked some of the characters, it has that Heroes feel to the movie!! Would recommend to watch!!"
3,Like A Modern Day Scanners,Some cool powers and neat special effects. Like a modern remake of the Scanners movie from the 80's. Worth watching.
4,Don't be pushed into this...,"I spent a couple of hours this afternoon watching stellar performances by Dakota Fanning, Chris Evans and Camilla Belle in the high techno thriller ""PUSH"". Talk about a psychological thriller. This one is so far out, I thought it was the sequel to ""Easy Rider""...2009 edition. Child star Dakota Fanning is superb, as is co-star Chris Evans (tremendous resemblance to 50s rock n' roll heart-throb Ricky Nelson). If you like non-stop action and twists that will have you scratching your head (whether or not you have hair), then don't wait to be ""pushed"" before you see ""PUSH"". It's one of those flicks where you can't miss a second or you may be side-tracked. Remarkable special effects, polished acting, and a profound soundtrack that makes up for a weak script. But who cares...it's a great ride. I give it 4 stars. SO now it's your turn to give it a rent. You won't be disappointed."
3,PUSH,"Wow, Dakota is sooo big. Like the movie, a little complicated but entertaining. I have seen Dakota's film since she started and she's an excellent artist."
2,Poorley Made,"I loved all the actors/actresses in this movie: Djimon Hounsou, Dakota Fanning, Chris Evans, Camilla Belle, and Maggie Siff, but even seeing there faces dids't make this movie enjoyable. In my opinion I think the creators of this spent all there money on the talent and left nothing for the producing. It seemed like a cheap movie."
1,PUSH this movie off a cliff!!!!!,"How to make a movie like ""Push"":1. All the boring ""mutant"" mumbo jumbo from X-Men2. Action scenes that rip off The Matrix3. A bunch of third rate actors/actresses4. Big, flashy effects5. Dakota FanningAll that, and you get this disaster in a nutshell. ""The movie that rocks out loud""??? Puh-leese."
1,WORST MOVIE,I like to see myself has a good person with movies and this movie by far SUCKED!!! I fell asleep in the movie theatre cuz how stupid it was. I love the actors but plot and other key points blew!!!
2,What a retarded flick......,"Aside from the glorious reviews given here, here's a few things overtly irritating about this dumb movie1. Dakota Fanning - Annoying to the point that would make fingernails on a chalkboard a melody. Now lets see an ""almost 14"" year old in a short skirt and streaked hair is just happening to be running around in Hong Kong.2. The Bleeders - Oh man, i have never laughed this much in my life seeing these caricatures and the faces they make. Its so ridiculosuly hilarious, talk about his resume.3. The sniffers - yuck... heading into inner wear territory4. The pusher (kira) - The girl who defines a pleasant day through the morgue. Dead pan face and errr.. what exactly was her role again?trying desperately to be some kind of Heroes wannabe, there is no continuity to the script (if you can call it a script), whoever did the casting for this movie should be arrested. All in all, if you want a good laugh, go see this one."
1,"Sounds a LOT like Stephen King's ""Firestarter""","The general topic and name for this movie, seems to be ripped off directly from Stephen King's ""Firestarter.""The Firestarter is a young pyrokinetic girl whose father has the ability to ""push"" people. Yes, ""push"" is the term used in the book. In this case, ""push"" means forcing your thoughts upon someone else and having them do whatever you want them to do.""Firestarter"" is a GREAT movie... Martin Sheen, George C. Scott, a very young Drew Barrymore, Heather Locklear, Louise Fletcher, Art Carney... fantastic lineup! And if that were not enough, Tangerine Dream does a beautfil job on the soundtrack! (I bought the CD.)Oh yeah... in ""Firestarter"", there are references to ""The Shop""... an ominous government agency. The two main characters are on the run from ""The Shop."" ""The Shop"" wants get them and control them.Do yourself a favor by adding ""Firestarter"" to your DVD collection. The book is good too."
5,Great Movie,This is a well written movie. Moves fast but has a good plot (a real story). The different than normal names for the various mental powers is unique (or it's been too long since I've read any new sci fi). First saw it on movie channels and have watched it often. I finally bought the DVD so I can watch it whenever. Highly recommend this one.
3,So-so movie,"Story seems like a knock-off of X-Men. Movie is so-so if you haven't seen X-Men. If you have, the comparison is inevitable, and this will come out on the short end."
5,I feel the opposite of the Amazon reviewer.,"My husband and I saw this video at a friend's last night and we were both blown away. It was not at all hard to follow. It was fast paced and full of action. Our friend has a little movie theater in his home. I don't know how much difference the big screen and fabulous speakers made, but I'd watch it again right now. 5 stars!"
4,Great Movie,"This was a really good movie. It kept my attention til the very end. If you like tv shows like Heros, this has a strong resemblance. Very good story line."
3,Ok,"I liked it, but found its plot a little twisted, not in a good way.There was minimal back story to prop up the diverse characters, with a lot of 'this is the way it is' attitude.The special effects were alright, but sometimes 'what is happening?'."
3,Should have been better,"The strongest feeling I had after watching this movie is, that it should have been better. It has a great premise - a group of young men and women with extraordinary powers running away from a mysterious government division. But the whole film seems to run amok, with the plot being more convoluted that it should be and the action and pacing hard to follow. It's also set in an exotic locale, which can be appealing to a lot of viewers, but the depiction of Hong Kong comes up short: settings like a food market, plus a group of gangsters (they really possess superpowers) seemed a little pat.The cast seemed at first a little teeny boppy from the DVD box, but they are actually fine. The ending is pretty good also, with a little surprise revelation. It also sets the movie up for a sequel, which might be OK if they can figure out a way to tell the story without confusing viewers."
4,Probably going to buy it.,"I've been renting a fair amount of movies lately, and Push is the first one that grabbed me enough to watch it more than once. The acting was very good, particularly Dakota Fanning, the story was interesting, the effects were exciting, and the characters were likeable (most of them, anyway). My only caveat is the very end of the movie, which just fizzles. The last fight scene is very cool, but after that the characters seem a bit lost as to what to do. I don't know, maybe they were trying to leave it a little open ended so there would be room for a sequel. I would definately watch a sequel."
3,Push more like dropped,"The family and I watched this video yesterday. From the preview and the trailer it looked to be a pretty good action flick.We were very disappointed with this movie. I don't want to spoil anything with this movie so I will summarize quickly, a in debt man who cant master his power (the main guy), a gifted girl who can see future and draws, 2 screaming idiots their scream kills things, an older woman who can see all and intimidates the gifted girl. last and not least of course some big boss guy who intimidates everyone in the movie.There you go I know my review may not be very wordy, but you can watch the video and see how you like it yourself, the best part is the fight scenes thats about it tho.I watch alot of videos because I enjoy them this video I thought we would like. However if you want to watch an awesome movie, watch Knowing."
2,nice steal,"The movie is based on various ideas appropriated (without acknowledgment) from Philip Dick's novels. This much it shares with recent Inception, but is less coherent. The movie is really not that bad, but it could use higher budget and better acting."
1,The worst movie I've seen in years,"At about the midpoint of this movie, I stopped trying to take it seriously and began trying to make a mental list of it's absurdities. I couldn't keep up. It's like they tried making The Matrix and ended up with The Matrix XII (extrapolate the drop off from Matrix 1 to 3 out four times). The fact that anyone could say they enjoyed this movie defies all logic and reason. I've never written a movie review on Amazon, but this was so bad I felt compelled to. Avert your eyes."
1,This movie PUSHED me into the world of BOREDOM,The special effects look primitive. The trailer shows the best scenes of this movie's special effects.The script is incoherent and boring. The acting is bland. It's a bad imitation of Xmen.I regret spending money to watch it in the theatre.
5,Another enigmatic and questionable plot but great Blu-ray!,"Because Blu-rays like this are gotten for their visual quality, not too much attention is paid to the plot. In this case, this is probably a good thing. Chris Evans was great in doing whatever he was doing!"
2,push,"I didn't like this movie. I found it very random. It kept flashing back and forth from present to future, so many times that it was hard to follow. I thought Dakota Fanning's acting was good in this one. I can't believe how grown up she's gotten. To think she was the one in I Am Sam, and now look at her. Beautiful. Anyways back to the review: The movie was ok. Slow moving at times. Random stuff happens. Overall, a good watch."
5,PUSH was great sci-fi adventure!,"I had been intrigued by the previews of PUSH I had seen in theaters and on TV, and it was just as enjoyable and exciting as I hoped. I am hoping they would make a sequel in the future!"
2,I really wanted to like this movie...,"...but it disappointed on too many levels. It's not a clever movie, it's very poorly acted, and the special affects just aren't special. The trailer was much better than the actual movie. I think - cuz after 15 minutes I threw it away"
2,Weird sci-fi movie. . too predictable . . bad acting. weird plot,"It was really bad acting, is there a part 2 of the movie push? The 13 year old girl, character in the movie mentions about her mother still beind held at ""The Division"" it looked good at first, but once I received it and watched it even my boyfriend thought it was weird. I never should have bought this movie."
2,I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone,"The plot was hard to follow, the transitions between some scenes were not smooth and at times did not make sense, I never understood why the chinese girl kept on pointing her gun at her enemies and never shot, the chinese guys screaming was a little corny, the hero kept on getting beat up, and overall just a boring movie. I was expecting alot more."
2,Choppy & Uncompleted,"Positives: Well one, it was a creative take on a time-worn story line of people with the always popular ""powers"" of telekinesis, clairvoyance, mind control, etc. being pursued by the always unpopular government in it's need to control whatever.Negative: Well many,(1.) Too heavy of a reliance on an Asian city backdrop and overbearing distracting music to provide ambience.(2.) Excessive wire use (people and things flying around) to the point of ridiculousness to provide action.(3.) Choppy editing of head shot jumping to head shot as actors couldn't get beyond exchanging single memorized bland lines.(4.) Dakota needs to take artistic control of her movies - she's too good for this. She also needs to develop real life experiences outside of Hollywood to expand and be a convincing young adult. All she could offer were forced, contrived acted facial expressions to represent her maturation."
2,Amazing video and sound quality in Blu-ray ...,"Push is just one more film that you can rent, but you have to rent it in Blu-ray ... one of the most natural, tridimensional video I have seen. A lot of times you feel like you are in the set !!! I use a Infocus 1080p projector in a screen of 120"". It really looks fantastic !!!"
4,Entertaining like a comic book.,If you like comic books then you might like this movie. Dakota Fanning was excellent and really was the star of this movie. I found the movie to be entertaining. There is some action but this is not really an action movie but has some twists and turns.
4,Great movie! 8/10,"This is a great movie. It's really neat seeing ""Dakota Fanning"" growing up in each movie that she does. The storyline seems simple at first but at times things can get a bit complicated but everything becomes clear at the end. To me this movie reminds me a little bit of the TV series ""Dark Angel"". So if you liked that show or if you simply just love action movies, you'll get into this."
1,Worst movie I've seen in years......,"I have to be honest. I didn't spend more than 15 minutes on this movie. The direction, the dialogue and the overall content were all so very wretched for me to tolerate.Watching Dakota and Chris interact with each other was such a bore. I said to myself, had this been the first movie that these two ever done it would probably be their last. This movie had such a low budget quality to it that it made these experienced actors look....callow. I generally like watching movies that these two have been in. Needless to say I was disappointed and I believe this movie was a bad career move for these actors.The one scene where those Asian guys could yell to the point of making your ears bleed was enough for me. I was a tad embittered by how lousy this film was and simply turned it off and went to bed. I couldn't take anymore of this garbage. It was totally cheesy."
2,PUSH by Chris Evans,"I MEANT TO GET PRECIOUS, WHICH I NOW HAVE.PUSH DIDN'T SAY MUCH TO ME SO I GAVE IT TO ONE OF MY GROWN CHILDREN AND THEY WILL PROBABLY LIKE IT.SCIENCE FICTION IS NOT MY FAVORITE."
3,Push-over,"I can see why this movie didn't make in in the theaters. You have to be into this genreget the show. The different names for the abilities (Mover, Stitch, Watcher, etc) can get a bit comfusing at times, but all in all a fun movie. So fix a cocktail, slip it in the DVD and enjoy the movie. I plan on watching it a couple (or more) times."
3,"Too Little, Too Late","This small booklet is an incredibly abridged version of Justice's longer book ""Stone Age Spear and Arrow Points."" Unfortunately all the benefits of the longer text are lost in this shorter ""field guide"" version. (For details see my review of the book cited above.) Although this book is nice as a pocket manual to carry in the field, it contains only one line drawing of each point type and a very abbreviated description of the points. One must ask the question, ""Who really wants to spend their time in the field looking at a book?"" Nobody. In the field, one wants to find artifacts. That is, leave the books at home and get down to the business of surveying and collecting. With this said, don't waste your money on this field guide. The larger, more profusely illustrated, and vastly more detailed version is just $10 more in paperback. Buy that instead!"
4,Price??,This EXACT Mixer is sold for 399 at other places on the internet. I refuse to pay this much AND shipping.
4,Good Brush,I was lucky enough to find this at a discount store. This is my first natural bristle hairbrush and it has become a part of my nightly routine. The bristles are short but reach through my thin straight hair and stimulate my scalp. Feels great. I look forward to using it. I have no problem getting hair out of the bristles.
3,Husband won't use,"I purchased this for my husband hoping that he would quit using my hair brush, but he doesn't like this and still uses mine."
3,strange but wonderful,"An incredible book, one your whole family would deeply enjoy reading . Wait until next fall when the movie release comes out titled: "" A lunatic in prison thinks he can write"". Hope you enjoy what u are reading"
4,but it a half size larger,If you buy this shoe get it in a half size larger than you wear. Because of the removable insoles but if you choose not to use the insoles then buy it in your size.
2,Middle of the Road,I have a hard time mustering more than three stars for this novel. With respect to his discussion of the science of sleeping - I found his reporting of current and historical research interesting but his own theories somewhat half-baked. The autobiographical portion of the book simply wasn't engaging. Not funny (like Devaid Sedaris) or terribly interesting either. Overall I think the book was fair at best.
5,Sleeping thrills,"This fascinating memoir weaves in facts about sleep disorders (including insomnia and somnambulism) and the study of sleep all in with the story of Hayes's life. Each chapter uses aspects of his life as a springboard for a discussion of things related to sleep. Sometimes the details almost became monotonous or tedious, but Hayes's style kept me interested in the intriguing details and little known information. I learned so much in this book, as well as thoroughly enjoyed the various reminiscences of Hayes's life, like his apparently inherited insomnia, his partner Steve's battles with HIV, and his search for a ""cure"" for his insomnia. He ultimately doesn't find an absolute cure, but rather he must come to grips with his unique sleeping patterns. This is an amazing memoir sure to fascinate even those who enjoy a good night's sleep."
4,Somewhat disappointing but a good read,"When I first saw this book at my local library, I pounced on it with great excitement. From the jacket notes, I was expecting an interesting melange of fact and memoir. Instead, the book is slim on facts--Mr. Hayes seems to be more fascinated with the scientists who have studied sleep rather than their findings--but rich in memoir. The author recalls interesting scenes from his childhood and adolescence, some of which involve his sleep and sleep routines, but most which don't. I found the description of his coming out poignant; and I read, on the edge my seat, about his lover's changing HIV status. The author should have stuck to memoir or perhaps even have fictionalized his own story (from which he seems able to pull the best parts) and left his thin description of sleep disorders out of the manuscript."
1,Piss-poor DVD,"My god, this was a disapointment! When I got this I thought it might have the extra features that the import version supposedly had. No dice, instead I'm stuck with a DVD containing two videos for the same song. Pretty damn bad, and even though I'm a diehard New Order fan this had no place in my collection. Don't waste your money, surely they'll do a DVD video collection as that seems to be the latest craze."
2,Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?,"I just got this in the mail, and I have to say I'm disappointed. Why? Because it's only got two tracks -- two different versions of the ""Crystal"" video! I mean, it's a great song and an entertaining video, but crikey, what a ripoff!I saw an import of this, and it included an audio b-side, plus three DVD clips from Reading '98 -- this has none of those!So if you've got ten bucks to drop on one song, do so. Meanwhile, I'm gonna return my unopened, and lament the fact that there's no product information for this disc!"
2,Just because it's New Order,"Far from what I like. If you like ""True Faith"", ""Blue Monday"" or Bizarre Love triangle, then you'll be as dissapointed as I was when I got this song. The remix is acceptable, but not what New Order was for me, if this song shows how the album is, then be sure I will not buy the album. The video is as stupid as anything you've seen before. The remix version video was made with $10 at most.If you like the old New Order (80's), then forget about this DVD. try instead the new Pet Shop Boys live concert - Montage."
2,"B grade plot, No consistent theme, good action though!",If you like to see guns and bullets this movie is fine. Otherwise there is nothing original or interesting.
3,Promising and O.K. sequel,"The movie started off promising, but this sequel to this made-for-video flick needs a little work. No desert storm sequences this time (thank goodness), but this time they may have copied some submarine scenes from ""Hunt for Red October"". Originally shown on HBO as ""Operation Delta Force II: Mayday."""
3,Cute but flimsy,"I really like the look of this clock but it's much flimsier than I expected. It was dropped onto a vinyl floor and dented very easily. Also we had to try several batteries (same make and model) to get it to work. It's strange - the clock will tick w/ any appropriately-sized battery but with the random one, the hands will not move.I was going to order several more after seeing it, but now I'm going to wait and see how it holds up - my hopes are not high at this point."
5,Nice looking clock,"Had the clock about 2 weeks now and thus far it is working well and looks nice, works well for the TV room and it is easy to read. It could easily go into the kitchen or home office just as well."
2,disappointed,"I was very excitied to try this. But unfortunatly I was let down. It did not do what it says, I broke out more everytime I used it. And it dried my skin til it peeled. So, I'm still looking."
3,"Too Much History, Not Enough Phylosophy","This is an excellent book for what it is---but it was not quite what I was looking for. Ataturk is a fascinating individual who dictated wideranging reforms. I wanted to know how and why he came by his phylosophies--other than he believed the church was a huge detriment to society.This is a very detailed history, including names of associates, political intrigues, battles, who moved what troops where, etc, but short on the reforms and their reasons. For example, page 468, ""An obedient assembly continued to pass laws imported from Europe: court procedure was reformed, the German commercial code and Swiss law on bankruptcy were adopted; agricultural cooperatives were established"". This is the only mention of any of these important things in the entire book.I'm certainly don't regret reading it and I learned a great deal. Now I need a book that goes into all the changed Ataturk made. If someone has a recommendation, pleas email me."
5,Perfect Loafers,I love suede so this is a perfect pair of loafers for me. Very comfortable and nice.
4,Satisfactory air cleaner for a small room,This unit cleans a surprising amount of filth from the air and is suitable for a small room.I wish the unit accepted washable filters.UPDATE Aug. 2010: I have knocked the unit off the shelf onto the carpet several times and it still functions. Still amazed at the amount of particulates it traps.
2,"It's ok, but the filters too expensive.","I've used this for about 6 months now and it does a decent job, with a noticeable change in the smell of the room (this is due to the ionizer i think). Hasn't eliminated dust buildup on surfaces but dust buildup has reduced as far as I can tell.However, now it is time to change the filter and I'm considering just getting a different purifier. Right now, a 2 pack of filters for the HAP412 are going for about $31. Considering that's almost the cost of the purifier (with 1 filter included), I'd suggest trying a purifier with a reusable/washable filter.It's quiet enough on the lowest setting and seems to do an OK job purifying but ultimately the filters are way too expensive."
5,Perfect!,"Small unit but powerful! We first tried it out as a loan from a neighbor and noticed an IMMEDIATE change in our baby's room air quality. After doing research to purchase our own we went with the same one for various reasons: Very affordable, small unit, powerful, quiet with adjustable settings(just like a pedestal fan), and finally and most importantly, does it's job (evident in our baby's cleared sinuses)! We are extremely happy with it."
1,Don't bother,"Bought this a year and a half ago to air out a small guest room in our house (we sometimes have a problem with neighbors'secondhand smoke). I used it rarely - less than 10 hours total. The first few times, it seemed to work well and I was happy with it.But when I used it again recently after a long break, I noticed that everything in the room was suddenly covered with a fine grey/black dust! Yuk!I replaced the filters immediately, but then I noticed a strong chemical smell coming from it that gave me headaches and a bad metallic taste in the mouth.Unfortunately it's too late to return this. I hate to throw things like this away, but I wouldn't give this to anyone else, so it is getting tossed."
2,"Into a Very Long, Boring Night","This is one boring film, with a pseudo-fey style that think tries to fool its audience into thinking it's cool. I love Ffieffer and Goldbum in their past and future work but they seem to be sleepwalking through a script that has flat dialogue that has him asking her over and over again to just let him go home--as everyone, but David Bowie, should have done before this film wrapped up. The eighties were great and riveting and ""Into the Night"" is not indicative of any of that."
3,"Good plot, but missing something. . .","I rented this movie for the sole reason that David Bowie is in it. His performance was wonderful, yet extremely brief. Therefore I was highly disapointed. Granted, the movie wasn't too bad, Pfiefer and Goldblum are both wonderful, but Bowie was gyped. He is an amazing actor and should have had a bigger part, or at lease more time on screen. I suggest this movie for the sole reason of seeing his 2 small scenes."
3,Style Over Substance,"What do you say about a movie that features David Bowie and Carl Perkins in a death grapple brandishing knives? Sounds to me like something concocted by SCTV. This film serves as a great travelogue to Los Angeles. Storywise, it is somewhat lacking. Also, it would help if you had more sympathetic leads. It's fun spotting celebrity cameos-to a point. Then it just gets tiresome. Director John Landis is trying to pay homage to film noir of the past but the film is too busy, too joky, and too slight to make any lasting impression. The best I can say for ""Into the Night"" it may be the best film to feature Body by Jake."
2,"Empty... car chase, shoot 'em up, and little plot and character development","I watched this late last night on cable while ironically suffering from my own insomnia. I probably saw it long ago in the '80's or early 90's but it is entirely forgettable. It seemed like Jeff Goldblum was desperately trying to instill some depth and substance, a second layer to this thin and linear story. Michelle Pfeiffer is young and sparklingly pretty in this but put in a fairly lame character role that gives her little room to actually act. Or perhaps she was simply inexperienced and figured she was jsut there to look good. The Bowie cameo was interesting. The string of murders, and bloody trail left thru this movie and in that callous, slightly comedic '80's way is really off-putting to me. You know...the bumbling Iranians blowing away or drowning anything that moves. ugh."
2,80's nostalgia but no value,"Goldblum & Pfeiffer were so young here. It's nice to see major names early in their career. Goldblum's character has insomnia which goes along with him sleeping through his performance. Funny moments weren't really funny. Why did this even try to be a comedy, drama, Moonlighting episode? Bowie is amazing as an actor but he really serves no purpose with his barely 8 minutes of screen time. The 80's soundtrack is cringe worthy. This movie has value for a Bowie fan & for some brief nudity of Pfeiffer."
4,Another awesome John Landis movie,"This a another great John Landis movie. You have cameos by people like David Bowie, Dan Aykroyd, Carl Perkins (Writer of Elvis song ""Blue Suede shoes), Bruce Mc Gill, and John Landis Himself. There is even a music video with BB King and featuring Jeff Goldblumm and Michelle Pfeiffer. John Landis also interviews BB King on here as well. The only thing I don't like about this movie is that the sound is mono and not Dolby or DTS surround. So if you are a fan of John Landis movies, or Jeff G. or Michelle P. or even BB King then this is a good video to buy."
4,A Real Sleeper..,"I really enjoyed this film, a black comedy, of sorts...with an intense pace and some very caustic twists in clever dialogue."
4,Excellent juxtaposition of music with horrors of the holocaust,"This documentary film provides an excellent exposition of how music by several jewish composers, and some non-jewish, influenced the thinking of the German people. The doc shows with brevity but illuminating clarity, what these composers and their music meant to Germans in a positive and uplifting way prior to the ascension of the Nazis. The film then moves inexorably forward to the rise of Nazism and how this music could be manipulated by this brutal totalitarian regime to further their nefarious and despicable schemes including the horrors of their genocide against the Jews and others."
5,we want the light,"This is a DVD about Wagner, his music and his history of virulent anti-semitism. What makes this wonderfully made DVD so interesting is the fact that many scholars, musicians, talking heads weigh in on their personal stand on Wagner and his music. Some find his legacy repugnant, and others manage to put the anti-semitism aside. The viewer is left having to decide for themselves. This DVD is well worth anyone's time and money. If you visit the website of Allegro .com, you can find out more about the making of the film."
5,Wonderful for the entire family,"I used this tape (and others) to help my sons become comfortable going to sleep alone. This very soothing, quieting tape is by far their favorite, and they never tire of it. My husband and I also like to listen to the tape, although I have never been able to stay awake to hear a complete story."
2,Dust in the Wind???,"While I have followed all of Wingman's adventure, this one's ending is the weakest, the remainder of the book is Wingman stuff.After reading the ending, readers don't know if the Wingman's ""dust in the wind"" or if he's delirious. Was the Mack sick or taking medication when he wrote this? A big dispointment - should have stopped at #15! One would have expected a good ending after having the readers hooked for 15 books (not counting last one ;-("
2,Slightly Disappointed,"Wishing on a star appears to be exactly that, a wish. Number 16 was OK, but get him back to his own time. I started reading the series too late to get all the series, but am now only missing 11. Hopefully it will be reissued, along with 17 being issued real soon."
3,The Tomorrow War,I liked the story line. I would like to see Hawk back into his real time. Keep up the good work Mack!
3,Hunter is supposed to be the main character... but...,"It seemed to me that #16 centered more around agent Y (Yaz) than on Hunter (drinking, womanizing, etc). Yaz was still alive in #15 in Hunter's reality/deminsion, so now that Hunter brought agent Y along, wouldn't we have two Yaz(s)?What happened at the end of #16? Was hunter dreaming or got lost in another deminsion again?"
5,Great talent,"Russell has been around since the 60's great singer songwriter, his early stuff The Real Thing and Paperwalls,Rachel are brilliant Psychedelic songs,considering this is Russell's second compilation and it is double what a wasted opportunity that it wasn't remastered and they left off Mr America."
4,THE STEP SCARE,"Hey guys, I am sure you will be really tense about the step 1!! It is definitely worth the scare, especially nowadays when programs are depending on the scores more and more for evaluating you. I think it is best to use this book as a dessert and not the main course. It would even suit as an appetiser, but definitely not the mail course. Pathoilogy is definitely the strenght of the book. us e this as a supplement to the Q bank of Kaplan. that is the best possible resource for step1. Good luck."
4,"Good, but WARNING","Good review book (great for cramming high yield stuff before 1st and 2nd year exams as well as before the USMLE), but be warned -- the index is missing from the 2000 edition. It's downloadable from the web, so it's not that big a deal. Not a good sole resource for Boards review, but still an important one to have."
4,Goes Great with Step-Up,"First Aid is by far, the gold standard for Step 1 review. It is very useful to go through the high yield facts in First Aid and incorporate them into the systems-based format of Step-Up: A High-Yield Systems Review for Step 1."
5,"A ""must-have"" for Step 1!","The absolute best review for USMLE Step 1. The easy to follow high-yield content, and above all, great mnemonics, make it an excellent day-to-day companion of your preparation for the exam."
1,it is about the numbers,"Sorry to say it but med school and residencies are all about the numbers. Yeah we like to talk about personal skills and the importance of dr-patient relationships and such, but in the end if you don't got a 240 then forget about radiology and if you can't get a 250 then forget about ortho and if you can post a 260 then plastics isn't for you, you will just have to be content making 90K a year as a pediatrician.So if you to just be a pediatrician or internist then go ahead and study for step 1 with First Aid. Just remember that every other uptight med student is memorizing it also. If you want to get into a competitive residency (ie if you want to be making the Benjamins once you are done) then you better not use this book as a primary review. You will be smoked by the competition.Peace Out!"
4,"Absolute necessity, but you'll need more than this.","The books of the First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 series help from the very day you decide to take the USMLE (or medicine, for that matter). It contains need-to-know information about the exam such as what the exam is like, when to register, what your score means, and what to do if you pass or fail. Furthermore, and most importantly, it contains the absolutely ""must know"" high-yield facts in every subject in Step 1's coverage and fun mnemonics to go along with them. This book also has a review of review books which helps you decide which books are best for you. It also includes a form you can submit mnemonics and suggestions with to improve next year's edition. However, obviously this book is not enough to pass step 1 of the USMLE, but it may give you a very good advantage."
5,Excellent for 2nd year med school use and Step 1 review,"This book is a must-have for second year medical students and anyone taking Step 1 of the USMLE. It's great preparation for your second year classes, and the most concise and comprehensive text of what you'll need to know for Step 1. If you understand the material in this book, you will do quite well on Step 1. The information could be a bit better organized, but otherwise this book is unreservedly recommended."
5,help in an instant,This book was very helpful when I was preparing for the board exams in the Philippines and for the US MLE. It helped me remember all the things that I studied during med school in a short span of time (better than digging up all those thick textbooks). The mnemonics were simple and very catchy.
4,Definately worth buying,"Vol. 6 was a little short, but as for overall content, there was alot better ball handling and crossovers than Vol.5. Even though the footage isn't long enough, I still think you'll get your money's worth."
3,Good but Short,"And 1 started of with a Skinny kid named Rafer Alston aka Skip to My Lou he put on a Basketball show in And 1 mixtape vol 1. Now after five mixtapes later Comes And 1 vol 6 which shows the game of Hotsauce,AO and Alimoe. Vol6 is good the DVD extras are ok Sauces Crosses is the best part of the extras. My main problem wit vol6 is that its toooooo short. Other than that it ok it could have been better"
3,could have been better,"I bought this the day it came out off of amazon and couldn't wait to see it. Most of the alimoe footage was actually already released footage off of the ""alimoe vs. skip "" battle tape that footaction gave to you for free when you bought anything And 1. Sauce's Crosses was way too short, and they need to get away from all of the interviews and get back to showing more game footage. Maybe in the future they will even have it broken up into different segments on dunks, tricks, crosses, and defense. Volume 1 and 3 still reigns supreme for me."
2,"Volume 5 is much better, so is Ball Access","Volume 6 is only 40 minutes long, #5 is like an hour and 20. The special features on #6 aren't so special. I liked how they did a city by city thing in volume 5. Volume 6 mainly focuses on Alimoe and Hotsauce, its not bad and I don't regret buying it. This dvd did not show off the 2003 tour real well. I'm sure there will be a better 2003 tour dvd later."
1,complete scam,"didnt even receive the product, was notified there was a mix-up, but still never got it after 3 weeks, complete joke"
5,The best b-ball of the world,"Oh! baby! this will be the best video about basketball, AND1 Mixtape Vol. 6!! I like they a lot, I have all the volumes and 16th september will be a special day. I'm waiting fot it, I need it!! oh man no comment to this video, IT WILL BE INCREDIBLE"
4,"LEGEND Roky with one of the best pysch influenced bands around, but Roky's performance ins't the best.","Love RokyReally like the Black Angels (he should've done his last album with them, NOT Okkervil River)Didn't like that Roky just doesn't have the stuff it takes to do this music anymore and that the performance and recording wasn't great or greatly recorded."
3,I watched like a Zombie!,"Ok this live footage of Roky from 2008 could have been so much better without all the creative effects and black n white images. when the full color appeared that was what i wanted to see! roky live in full color! why would anyone mess with this!?! why not release the whole concert as well? 37 minutes but it seems much longer because you get distracted by lame effects and edits of the concert. who cares about backstage banter??? the show sounded good but roky clearly cannot sing anymore or that night anyway. wish that there were more aliens songs than elevators. his backup band were good and the jug was annoying but wasn't it always? hopefully some other proper concert footage will be released for all to enjoy. roky deserves so much better. so unless you get this real cheap or for free, pass on it and by his music instead."
4,Still Need Flour!,"I bought this rolling pin with the assumption that I wouldn't need any flour. Wrong!! Minimal flour is still needed. However, I liked this pin in all other aspects such as the weight (heavy, but not too much) and the steel bearings, which make for a smooth roll."
2,Disappointed...,I was really optimistic about this product...but I found myself going back to my old wooden pin that this product SHOULD have way outclassed. Even with a light dusting of flour dough still managed to stick to this.
2,"Wife doesn't use it, everything sticks to it...","This thing is wonderful if you can keep it clean. I bought this for my wife, a commercial pastry chef, and she rarely if ever uses it. She complains that everything sticks to it. I suggested dusting it with flour to keep that from happening but she still doesn't use it.Just consider that fact before you buy..."
3,Gutes Clubkonzert,Gutes Clubkonzert mit einem klasse Sound.Der gute Paul hätte ruhig noch ein paar Hintergrundinformationen mit raufpacken können.
1,Great show/Awful DVD,"It's sad that someone can call himself a director and know so little about what they are taking about. The problem isn't the aspect ratio, this release isn't ""enhanced for HDTVs"" and that is the real problem here.I'm calling it a release, instead of a ""DVD"", because in order to legally carry the DVD logo your product must have a default Dolby Digital audio track, this has a ""DTS"" default. Should this product be recalled? I think so. Sad, sad, sad.If you don't own an HDTV, you'll probably enjoy this release very much. For the rest of us, I already returned my copy."
5,Awesome Job Paul,"Way to go Paul, lot of heart in this one. Paul in my mind enjoys what he is doing unlike some musicians all about the money. Ths dvd is great, Paul really connected with his fans on this one once again."
5,MagicDivaCT,"This is a totally awesome DVD! I saw ""Magic Touch"" on you tube, and found out about the DVD. Very well done, Paul expresses himself beautifully, his ""Rockstar House band"" These guys are fantastic! They rock, while singing some of Paul Stanley's favorite songs, some love songs. The lead guitarist, Rafel Moreina really wails, and keyboards and vocals- Paul Mircovich are awesome as well as the others. For any Paul Stanley fan, this DVD is a must have! I must rate it all 5 stars, for quality, great entertainment, & I like his prologue, it's very inspiring! Overall, a great DVD to have in your collection! I found and bought this from Amazon.com"
4,Awesome show!,"This dvd capture Paul Stanley last solo tour with an outstanding fenomenal band. The show is great, the tracklist is complete with such of my fave Kiss and Paul tunes ever. My only regret is about the sound mix where you can barely hear the drums."
3,Ultimate rock star,"Paul Stanley is as comfortable on a stage as anybody else is in their living rooms. He's got a real cool attitude; he's the ultimate rock star.The lead vocals on this DVD are great but the back up singers are excellent too (just listen to ""Move on"" !)The set list is almost perfect though I wish they had played ""Crazy, crazy nights"" instead of ""Lick it up"".A good show and a good way to wait for the next KISS album !"
3,Good when balanced,"As long as Paul Stanley performs without 'vocal-extravaganzas' it's a good performance and the band delivers and excelles by far what KISS ever has been able.As mentioned by some regarding the video-format on the dvd: if you have a display set to 'scan-mode' the picture will look 'flat'. Turn the display to zoome-mode or wide-zoome. That will transform the picture to correct proportions.The video-content is neither in anamorph 2.40, 2.35 or 1.78 aspectratio.Tomas Lange"
1,Defective dvd,"DVD was unfortunately defective (no sound, but video was fine). Amazon was great, exchanged for same item, but same defect, so they promtly provided refund."
3,Aspect Ratio???,"As a die hard KISS fan, I was so looking forward to this DVD for the longest time, knowing that it's been in the works for some time. That being said, hearing about HOW it was shot, with high definition cameras, etc, I assumed the presentation would be in a 16X9 aspect ratio, enhanced for widescreen TV's, etc. Not so. Unless I'm missing something, or have missed a setting somewhere on my DVD player, TV, or remote(you have to check all of these now!), I think we are getting a 4X3 letterboxed presentation. If that's the case, what a shame. This DVD and show deserved better. If they shot it wide screen, why not present it widescreen? I also want to add that the DVD was shot great and sounds amazing, and I hate to even say anything negative because I have supported KISS all my life, but this aspect ratio thing was something I felt I needed to speak out about."
5,Well worth the wait.,I've watched this a few times now and am still trying to find the right words to describe what a great dvd this is.Louis Antonelli and Paul should be very proud of this dvd. The camera puts you right on to the stage in the middle of the action. Everyone on stage got their fair share of the limelight.The band was absolutely awesome in their talent and enthusiasm. There was definite camaraderie between the guys and Paul and it shows. And then there is Paul Stanley. This is a classic example of why he has been so successful in the music business for over thirty-five years.The man just keeps getting better and better. I just hope we don't have to wait too long before Paul releases another solo cd and concert tour.
4,Picture and sound perfect - I have no idea what the problem is.,"I read all the reviews and was reluctant to say the least. I was expecting the picture quality to be low, the sound odd, but low and behold it was all great!!If anything the sound is so good its a bit suspicious and very clear. Maybe a little done in the studio after!!!I found it a great dvd and on my home theatre set up, no problem and absolutely perfect if sound and picture.Great show but not a Kiss concert."
5,One of the GREATEST shows ever !!!,"I was there at House of Blues in Chicago on Nov 6, 2006. This is a MUST SEE concert DVD! I not only was lucky enough to attend this show, but I was granted entry to the pre-show soundcheck, met the Starchild and got his autograph! Having been a huge KISS fan for over 30 yrs, it was a highlight of my life that I will NEVER forget. Paul did it all at this show...KISS classics, new rockin tunes from his latest ""Live To Win"" CD, and early never before performed live material from his first solo album! I have been going crazy waiting for this release for almost 2 years! I can't believe the time is so near. I know myself and millions of diehard Starchild fans will not be disappointed! Rok On Paul ! We love you !!- CooP in Indy"
5,PAUL STANLEY'S ONE LIVE KISS,"One Live KissWOW! This DVD is amazing. I knew it was going to be great because its PAUL STANLEY and after going to 6 of his Australian shows I couldn't wait to get my hands on this DVD. I don't know how he did it but Louis Antonelli captured the atmosphere from one of Paul Stanley's shows perfectly, its magic. As soon as the music started it was like I was transported back to one of Paul Stanley's shows last year, I can't stop watching it. This has to be one of the BEST live DVDs I have ever seen. If you were lucky enough to be at one of Paul Stanley's shows, then you can say you've been in the presence of greatness and thanks to Louis Antonelli we can relive it forever. What more can I say? EVERYBODY BUY IT!!!!!!!"
3,Classic,"A classic on DVD. Very good transfer to digital. But where is the extra stuff? They should have dug up some interviews or outtakes or something to go with it, since it's on DVD now."
2,MY GRADE: C plus to B minus.,"This picture is an homage to the original 1964 ""Fail Safe"" but is quite the disappointment in that it doesn't offer much of anything new. After watching both I felt the original was done better and I was in the audience for this 2000 picture.It stars a number of big names such as George Clooney, Noah Wyle, Richard Dreyfuss, Harvey Keitel, Brian Dennehy, Walter Cronkite, Don Cheadle, James Cromwell, Sam Elliott and John Diehl. What an awesome cast. Now go see the original.This was made for television and was purposefully presented in black and white.CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C to C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION THEMES: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid July 2012."
3,Fail Safe comment,"I do not concur with previous comments,i thought it was great.well worth the purchase and great cast.always enjoy Brian Dennehy and Richard Dreyfuss.everyone made it work."
4,Fail Safe DVD Could Have Been Better,The DVD for this version of Fail Safe is actually in the widescreen format. The package says it is in a matted widescreen format and I measured the aspect ratio at about 1.67:1. Unfortunately the DVD was not anamorphic (not enhanced for widescreen televisions). At this point in time Warner Brothers should have made this disc anamorphic. Other than that the movie and disc were fine.
4,FailSafe Remake,"This is the re-make of FailSafe starring George Clooney and Richard Dreyfuss. I am always going to go back to the original FailSafe starring Henry Fonda but the re-make is more than good and Clooney and Dreyfus shine, the story is again in black and white and pretty much holds to the original film. If you liked the original FailSafe then you will like this re-make."
3,"The animation is cheap, and it's really for little kids","As I said, unless you have a little kid with kombat on his mind, rent the live action movie. END"
2,Very disappointed with packaging,This comes in a DVD case rather than a Blu-ray case. I was very surprised by this as Funimation has been very good about the quality of their packaging for previous Blu-ray releases.
3,An Honest Overview Book about Modern Living,"This book is divided into several components ie. elements, comfort, function, detail which are further broken down into small components. Pictures are used sparingly & most of them are taken from the same source anyway. I do not learn anything new in this modern living book but rather, reinforcing what I have already learnt from other interior books throughout the years. Just because Terence Conran is rendered as the guru of modern living, it doesn't imply that he's the person that has reinvented the wheel but just that person with the extra edge or confidence to apply what we have already known all along about modern living, that person who opts to lead a simplistic life. I'm very appreciative of him of stressing one point about the rigidity of minimalistic living, & people keep mixing up the word ""minimal"" living with ""modern"" living. Whilst it's true that their fundamentals are more or less the same, they still aren't the same thing."
3,Brazillian music,This is a CD with some good brazillian bands. It has what we call axe music. If you like latino music you'll like this record! When you listen to it you can't stop dancing!!
2,Book leaves out way too much detail,"I just paid [dollar amount] and it took 4 hours to get through 30 pages! I am no math slouch, but my probability skills are pretty weak. And Ross has one paragraph of explanation to 5 pages of examples and laborious proofs.As mentioned above, I suggest a supplement or simply another book. Filler/Chang are excellent together. Ross may be good for additional material especially for stochastic processes and simulation. But its definately not an ""introduction""."
1,WORKED FOR ONE MONTH,"HAD THIS AMP HOOKED UP TO SOME 6.5 COMPONENTS AND 4X6 COMPONENTS , SOUNDED REAL GOOD BUT THAN A WEEK AGO I WAS LISTENING TO MUSIC THEN THE AMP JUST WENT CRAZY IT MADE THE SPEAKER SOUND LIKE THE WIRES WERE CROSSED BUT THEY WERE NOT SO I BOUGHT A CRUNCH AMP TO REPLACE IT , HOPEFULLY I CAN GET THE OBCON FIXED BECAUSE I REALLY LIKED IT"
1,Dont Get it!!,"My buddy had 2 600 watt Obcon 12s hooked up to this, i got the subs from him and hooked them up to a 1000 watt pyramid amp and it was 10 times better! and cheaper, you can get way more for your buck!"
5,A basic gift to friends,"When in doubt, give this book (small size version) as a gift. It is wonderful, truly. For a Zen beginner or just to have another copy for the car or train--it is the best."
5,Great unit - Terrible shipper,"Very satisfied with this unit. Great picture. Good/useful features. Sensible controls. Built-in DVD very easy/handy to use.But - terrible shipping experience. First unit mysteriously ""disappeared"" after making it as far as the final UPS delivery truck. Second unit had obviously been removed from the original factory packaging, and then hurriedly stuffed back into the box, with resulting damage to packaging materials, along with parts which were no longer adequately protected.This unit, ordered from Amazon, is shipped by Electronics Expo, who uses only UPS as their contracted shipper. Electronics Expo was very helpful during the claim process (with UPS), keeping in constant communication. UPS, on the other hand, was very unreliable, failing to follow through on their promised responses during the two-week process. The customer should have at least a small choice of shippers."
1,A big disappointment with Regza,"Four years later after it was purchased new, Toshiba Regza 26LV67 broke: Picture is shaking in black and white, no sound. Will need to try to repair it. Item which cost 720 dollars goes bad in four years? My 15 inch Sylvania color TV which I bought more than 25 years ago and used with my Commodore 64 computer still works fine, never had to be repaired, and it cost some 150 dollars then....I am not happy with Toshiba quality: This TV should have lasted much longer. I would not recommend buying it. From little checking on the web I have found many negative comments from customers unhappy with poor quality of the Regzas of all sizes.When it worked it was fine, but breaking only after four years? one star only."
1,TV REVIEW,"THIS TV WOULD BE PERFECT IF IT WAS RECEIVING HD SIGNALS ALL THE TIME.WHEN IT IS ON JUST REGULAR TV, IT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE OLD STYLETUBE TV IT REPLACED. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OFRECEPTION IN THAT RESPECT!"
4,Collection of Jokes from Jeff Foxworthy,"You Might Be a Redneck If... is a funny collection of the standup comedian Jeff Foxworthy's, you might be a redneck if jokes. There are many laugh out loud funny redneck jokes here - so if you want to stick a few in your back pocket to be the funny guy or gal at a party, this is a good source of material.While reading these jokes on paper is not nearly as funny as seeing Foxworthy perform them live, this book will provide you a few laughs in your leisure reading time."
5,Its Hilarious,"I bought it for my dad for his birthday since he thinks he's a ""redneckxican"" and he loves it. :)"
5,OEM Quality,Looks identical to the OEM filter I replaced with it except no printing on one side and costs a lot less. Just pay attention to which side is up on the original so you don't install this one backwards.
2,I JUST COULDN'T GIVE IT 1 STAR! WHAT A SHAME!,"I will have to echo the other reviews here. This album isn't so bad,but the sound mix is awful. Jason's voice sounds shot to H E L L ! It's sad that a good effort by a band that should have been huge is done in by a bad sound mix! For die hard fans only. If you are just learning about Samiam try 'Billy' or 'Soar'. This one just breaks your heart!"
1,biggest disapointment of the year,"I won't bore you with a long explanation about why i was so disapointed by this album. I was a huge fan, this was a huge disapointment. the engineering and production of the album is terrible, the song writing is extremely dated (as is the cover of the album), and i wish that I had listened to this album before i thought about buying it because i'd be $20 richer and all the wiser.but give it a listen and see for yourself."
1,Garbage,"I bought this book to help me with a school project but all I have to say is: If you want a book that pertains to a specific piece of software which was not represented in the description, then go for it!Seriously, this does not help you plan a film budget, all this book covers is the list of accounts (it describes the items that would be expensed under these accounts) that a certain piece of software used to help budget a production has, I can't remember the name of the product, but trust me, this book isn't worth it!"
4,An engaging final effort,"The first of this two disc set really lacks cohesion and gives the feel of something quite different from a polished studio album. Its eclectic selection is at times very upbeat and at times haunting with great gems tucked among some lackluster songs. I would say that about half of this disc is really good the other half mediocre. However, as a die-hard-stick-with-her-through-her-crazy-stunts fan, I wouldn't want it to be one second shorter. The second disc is one of the better live concert CDs I've ever heard. I have some bootlegs of shows that she did after I Do Not Want... and this concert is on par with any of them. The sound quality is rich and even. Sinead really gives it her all, especially on great renditions of Paddy's Lament, You Made Me the Thief of Your Heart and Fire on Babylon. Also her version of Nothing Compares 2 U is so beautiful it will make you forget that you've heard this song 100,000 times and had grown sick of it."
1,Made glad I bought it used!,This has to be one of the worst albums I have ever purchased. There is only one song on each disc that is worth listening too.Unless you are a HUGE groupie fan....stay away!
4,"love it, but now it's discontinued","We've been using the Select-A-Show Soother for over a year, and it's an integral part of my son's bedtime routine. Now that he's two, though, we've hit a snag. He loves to play with the image plates (he calls them ""keys"") and now they are all gone. Fisher Price discontinued the product, so it's impossible to find replacement image plates. It's a great item, but hang on to the image plates, because when they're gone, they're really gone, and now our bedtime routine is in turmoil."
5,My kids love it,My kids love this things so much. They are 2 and 6. They have had to share a room for awhile and they listen to it and watch it every night before bed. Now they are close to getting their own rooms and I may have to get another one. It is very durable too. My 2 year old has lugged it around and dropped it a few times and it is no worse for the wear. We have had it since she was a baby.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased the Select-a-Show-Soother for my 6 month old Grandson. Unless you have a very light painted room and ceiling, don't bother purchasing this product. The designs will not show up on dark walls and even if your ceiling is painted white, the images are still fuzzy. It is also perplexing to find a place to sit this product AND allow the baby to actually see the designs that will show up on the ceiling/wall. There should be more slides that come with the product or the availability to purchase more slides according to the baby's age.The good points of this product are that it tilts so that one can TRY to find a space for the lights to project and you have 4 choices of music to choose from. The music is soothing."
2,Not what I expected,"I was not at all impressed with this product. The idea is nice, but the delivery was b*o*r*i*n*g! The musical selections were not very good, and the light ""show"" was hardly a show at all! The same three pictures flashing over you over and over hardly qualifies as a show! I returned the item and bought a lighted aquarium mobile--much better!"
5,Great product!,"My 5 week old son is in love with this product. It is the only thing that captivates his attention. Even when he is crying and i lay him in his crib and turn on the light show he just stops crying and stares at the shapes and colors. The time settings are great also, 15 minutes is just enough time for him to relax and fall asleep. The light projects great and since he is only 5 weeks old i have it resting sideways so the projection is on the wall closer to him than the ceiling. Both ways the lighting is just enough. The music variety is great also.I would recommend this product to anyone! Definitely worth the price especially since you can move this from room to room."
2,Not worth the money...,"I bought this at Wal-mart for my 3 month old son. It's a good idea, but the lights just aren't bright enough to project on the ceiling. Putting it on a higher stand seemed to work, except the piece only angles one way, so images are upside down, or you can't get to the buttons if the crib is in a different direction. Also, there are only 3 options on the select-a-show insert, each having three different shapes that only fade in and out in red, yellow, and green. I wish they moved or turned, but they stay stationary. This product did not seem to help much, but does have a few songs that could occupy a baby when they AREN'T fussing."
4,Love it,I bought this for my boy when he was five months. He loves the music (mainlly the classical.) He enjoys all of the light shows. We have made it a bedtime routine to turn on the lights and music. He can also sit and play with it on the floor without breaking it. I only wish that there were more slides available for purchase. He is now eight months and still shows interest.
1,Just doesn't work,"This product was very dissapointing, you cannot see the shapes of the light show. It just doesn't serve it's purpose! I am taking it back to the store."
1,don't buy this thing,"i bought this for my baby and when i turned it on, i was terribly disappointed...the music drags, the light ""show???"" is blurry, and it just sits there fading in and out...there is nothing interesting or entertaining about it...i'm returning it tomorrow...i bought it today..."
4,I Love It!,"I bought this product for 2 baby showers before I had my son, because I thought it was such a great idea....I couldn't wait to go out and buy it when I had my son to put in his room. He is 15 months old now and we use it every night. I agree with the last review that it does everything it promises, and I have not had any problem with blurry or hard-to-see images. As a matter of fact, I was impessed at how well the image projects, and, believe it or not, I have the prduct on a night stand about 4 feet away from the crib, and I angled the product to project right over the crib, and the images are perfect. I love it and am buying one right now to send to a baby shower that I cannot attend!"
1,"Used product sent, and didn't even work.","The toy is probably a great product. However when we received it from Babyage, the box was taped shut, and the tie-downs in side were balled up, as if it had already been opened and returned. My wife opened the box and the toy has scuff marks on it, and we couldn't even get it to work. We called babyage and they were nice enough to refund the price of the toy (minus shipping of course) and then just told us to keep it (at that time we didn't know that it didn't work). Shortly thereafter we got an email from them asking to talk to them first before submitting our review on Amazon, so I sent them the same letter that I'm writing here and that was over 2 weeks ago and we have yet to hear from them. We really wanted the toy but it's a hard to find toy at this point for some reason, so we'll just have to keep looking and steer clear of Babyage."
2,Not all that great,"I was looking for something that could take the place of a mobile for my baby's cradle/crib/etc and thought this might fit the bill. My biggest complaints:- It won't stay on longer than 15 minutes (by design)- It isn't very bright, the designs only show if the room is almost pitch black- There isn't any motion, just three shapes that fade in and outI can't complain too much though, the price was certainly right."
1,Too much work!,"The blue light is cool, but everything else about this machine is a pain. Salt builds up all over the inside of the machine and is nearly impossible to clean. Much of this build-up is right near the motor, which is likely to present a safety hazard. It must be cleaned twice/week to minimize the salt. It evaporates 2 gallons/day, but only holds 1 gallon, so it must be filled twice/day. The metal wicks are a good idea, but overall this machine is a LOT of work. My regular humidifier with a paper wick is much easier to clean and use."
3,no staying power band never got off the stage/ground,"i would have to say this band is not willing to give us 110%they have been together for over 3 years and still haven't realized to be a successful band you have to play your music not just put it on disc. finding the right grove has not been this bands desire. i am no record company but i know good music and this is good music, now put all your ducks in a row, get off your ass and be musicians you over the hill wanta bee's. remember it is not your age, it's time to rock (not in your rocking chairs). so if your really musicains let see you kick rock and roll ass."
3,Come on People,"If i were to take this cd to Puerto Rico or Dominican Republic and give it to somone they would call me a typical ""GRINGO"". In the US we fall for Daddy yankee but why i dont get it? Why is he great? He has a song about gas for god sakes! He cant even ryhme properly. Basically the guy has no street credibility. Add this cd to your collection but you want real music get Don Omar the last don, and also wait for his new album called self. I also recommend tito y hector, they are pioneers of reggaeton."
5,Best reggaeton album I heard!,"No doubt, this album is the bomb. Even if you've never heard of reggaeton before (Nina Sky is one of the fairly played on the radio), you'll love that guy. The beats are great, his flow is tight and most of the 21 songs are dynamite!! I love it!"
4,Reggaeton taking over,Reggaeton is taking over and Daddy Yankee is leading the way. Album is great will keep you moving and dancing. La Gasolina is fire.
5,This is the best CD I have bought in a long time,"After my spanish class did a performance to the song Gasolina, I started listening to other songs of Daddy Yankee's. I'm so glad I did!! There is not one song on there that I wouldn't listen to. The only frustrating thing is I can't figure out which song I like the best!"
3,Glory,"The cd is alright...its more tho made up then his older stuff...his older stuff is more real. Gasolina wouldnt of gotten very far without GLORY doing the chorus so he made a very very smart move there...if anything GLORY's cd ""Glou/Glory"" is off da chain!!!!!!!!!!! She's killin Ivy Queen and Adassa and Daddy Yankee with dat song w/ don omar...and her first single wass off the hook...you all gotta check out that cd! BUt over all this cd was alright...his older stuff was alot better"
1,Reggaeton is not hip hop,"I hate this cd. The entire album is about sex and dancing in the clubs. I'm a 100% puertorican and I hate for real reggaeton. Kids in my Island are growing up listening to this (...) and don't know nothing about real lyrics and hip hop culture. I know that this reggaeton beats make u feel like dancing very sexy with the girls, but don't get confused that ain't hip hop. I hope that one day this reggaeton era would end. And one more thing, reggaeton is not original from Puerto Rico is started in Panama, so all the puertoricans that say is their music, they are wrong."
1,This marks the end of reggeton,"I am a 19 year old dominican guy, and I've been listening reggaeton since I was about 9. I have this album, and I can tell ya, this is one of the worse reggaeton albums ever. The old-school reggaeton artists are far better than Daddy Yankee (DJ Playero, The Noise, Vico-C). Daddy Yankee used to make good songs, but this is waaaaaaaaaaay to commercial. This is almost reggaeton pop (always the same ""Dembow"" beat, nothing innovative), reptitive (I HATE that gasolina song). Guys, this is garbage. Want to listen some good reggaeton with some creativity? Try to get some of the old DJ Playero compilations (37,42, and the 40, which is my favorite: Note: those are compilations of underground reggaeton songs, thats what you call true reggaeton),and Tego Calderon, who has a waaaaaaay better flow than daddy Yankee. Please, try to get one of the aforementioned albums, and in the meantime, do yourself a favor and avoid to listen to this crap. This is not reggaeton, is pure garbage."
4,OK....I Guess,"I really don't like Reggaeton because the reggaeton artists think they're kooo and let me tell you something, they're not!!!. The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 0 is because I like the songs Gasolina,King Daddy,No Me Dejes Solo,and Lo Que Paso,Paso.Daddy Yankee is the ONLY reggaeton artist that I like.He may think that he's a big MC,but I still think he's kooo."
3,Its all the same really,"I bought this album as a momento of my Florida 2004 holiday. I've heard the 'Gasolina' track trying to break through in the UK this year while last year it was already a hit in the US.When I got the album I was disappointed. Every track was pretty much the same with a couple of tracks slightly different. Obviously he's rapping in Spanish so I don't understand anything. Maybe for Spanish rap lovers it would be better. I love the Gasolina track though, but I wouldn't recommend buying the whole album on the basis of that one song."
3,Repetetive but enjoyable,Picked up on reggaeton while in Honduras. Gasolina was a big dance fave there so I mostly listen to this CD for sentimental reasons.
1,Gerardo of '05,"Gasolina -- Worst song in years...rivals Rico Suave. This guy should be ashamed for making such a remarkably bad song, and the people that listen to it should never leave home."
1,REGGEATON: WORST MUSIC GENRE EVER,Latinos must be really proud of achieving the impossible.We created a music genre even worse than hip-hop.
1,CRAP !,Who is this punk? a attempt of eminem or what? Is this music? lol nobody will cry if this genre of music die.
4,Nice,"destend to be a classic but as a few ""fill in tracks"" which keeped it from being a 5 star cd like baby rasta Y gringo's sentenciados"
3,Buy a few mp3's instead,"The cd has a few good tracks. Lo que pasó, pasó is good and there are a couple others. All in all though I would buy a select few mp3's and pass on the CD."
5,"A ""must have"" for any family wanting to have a christian home.","From the very first page in chapter one ""Why a Christian Home?"", Robert Wolgemuth captures the readers attention to the value of being a believer and practicing ones faith as a testimony to your family, neighbors, friends and others. Mr. Wolgemuth discusses in 223 pages (10 chapters) the essentials of a home where Gods' essence is there to witness to those who enter the home, ""there is something different about this place"". Chapters cover topics on bringing your children to Christ, how to help them memorize scripture, and how to see ""by example"" what being a christian truely is. Even those without children are benefited with powerful testimonies throughout the book, counsel on how to work with your mate. I wish I had had this book some 30 years ago when we were first married. A Spirit filled and moving book, needed in every home now days."
5,I'll read this again...,"I loved this book, so much that I'm buying it for gifts! Written with the traditional family in mind, Robert Wolgumuth uses honest,personal examples & stories from his own life to illustrate much needed do's and don't's for successful family relationships. Along with the Biblical references and explanations, this book is a ""must own"" encouragement for every family. Reading it was like talking with a friend. I was deeply moved."
3,Solid western,"This is about a man (Robert Mitchum) who brings order to a town, bullied by a local kingpin and his outfit.He is a ""towntamer"" by profession. A man with a bitter past who shoots to kill.The plot is much similar to the plot of the movie ""Warlock"" from 1959, starring Henry Fonda, Richard Widmark and Antony Quinn. ""man with the gun"" is a good and solid western. It has a steady pace and competent camerawork.Robert Mitchum is excellent as the towntamer, really anchoring the movie.Quite enjoyable to watch and the kind of movie that you can stand watching several times. But in all fairness I must say that ""Warlock"" is a notch better than ""man with a gun"".Good picture quality and sound.Overall well worth purchasing."
2,"Mitchum can't save tedious, cliched B western","Slow, cliche ridden, poorly paced excuse for a B-Western can't be saved even by Mitchum's strong presence. Overblown musical score, undeveloped secondary characters, uninspired photography. There have been many great movies made with the theme of a town tamer brought in to clean up a tough town, only to be despised for doing his job -- amongst the legion of great films along these lines I'd recommend ""Warlock"", with Henry Fonda, Richard Widmark and Anthony Quinn. This movie is not in that class. Definitely avoid it unless you are in need of a Robert Mitchum fix."
3,OK but don't leave them out,"This is a good book in itself but for me it has a great fault, it does not cater for people like me. I took this book to Argentina hoping to support my feable language skills but was rather disappointed. They could not understand what I meant. Eventually I was told that the vocabulary in this book is for European Spanish. They use different words and phrases in everyday speech. Perhaps there could be an Argentinian or Latin American version of this vocabulary, it would be very helpful for people like me. I would also welcome words and phrases for Mexico and the other Latin American countries (I don't mean Brazil, I know they speak Portuguese there)."
3,A little disappointed,"I only gave this three stars because the aquamarine stone does not shine as much as the citrine ring. I bought this one because I loved the citrine one. The ring is nice overall but does not stand out as much as the other one. The ring did come fast, it came within four days. If you have the citrine ring I don't recommend this one because you will be disappointed.Sterling Silver Band Citrine Cubic Zirconia Ring"
1,Buyer Beware,"Avoid this company like the plaque. You need to plan on spending $200 every 3 to 4 years for repairs. As another reviewer stated their warranty is terrible. Parts are expensive and their shipping is riiculous. I have had to same part fail me twice and had a customer service rep admit that they had a manufacture problem with some of those parts, but still insisted I pay $117 dollars for parts and $75 dollars shipping overnight. And the worst part is the part wasn't shipped overnight. Said there was some confusion, but still demanded I pay $75 dollars shipping. Again do not buy from this company they will not stand behind their product."
1,Mother-board nightmare,This tankless has been a nightmare. I am on my second circuit board with back to back failures. There is clearly a design flaw as I am reading the other reviews and see a trend in the problems with the board.. I'm now left to throwing my $800.00 water heater in the trash and starting over due to frustration....
1,Do NOT Buy it,"I bought an RA28 wholehouse unit to be economical and save money. In eight years I spent more than 6 times what I would have spent had I bought a tank unit to begin with. In five years I had to replace 4 circuit boards, over $400 in heat sensors and other unit parts that broke. And, I spent numberous days without hot water because of customer support. The unit was always going down. On the eighth year the circuit board went out again and other components started leaking. I decommissioned it and installed a tank unit. My best advice is don't buy one."
1,Seisco Tanks,"If you are planning to purchase a Seisco Tankless Water Heater, you might just prefer just to flush your cash down the toilet. We have had one for just over a year and have had trouble 3 times. When you need parts, plan on paying for them and paying for shipping. There is not much of a warranty and customer service is very kind but ineffective. We love the idea of tankless but made a very poor decision going with this company. Please do not make the mistake we did unless you like a cold shower."
1,Absolute junk,"ANyone who gave this garbage box more than one star either works for Seisco or has only had it for 6 months or less. I bought a house that had two of these inline already installed. It needs two because one will only run one shower. I think they are the 32's even, but for sure no lower than a 28. I have had issues 3 separate times with both of them. They either leak or the board goes out. They replaced both of them with brand new units and they both managed to last 13 months this time (just outside of 1 year warranty of course). Fortunately I have a home warranty that covered these pieces of junk. THey are being replaced this week with a gas tankless unit (Navien) 240.. They are monster users of power as well.."
2,RA28 problems,"We ordered a tankless water heater to be installed into our newly constructed house in mid-2010. Love that I can take long, hot showers, BUT had to replace the motherboard less than a year after moving in. It took the company almost a week to ship it to us- after many phone calls with them asking the same questions over and over. When we told them that the motherboard was actually smoking, we were told that there is NO WAY that could happen because of a treatment that they put on the board. We offered to send them a picture, but they declined. So here we are, about 5 months after replacing the motherboard and we are waiting for another one to be shipped. The motherboard they sent just fried and was smoking in the same area as the last one. We are quite disappointed in this unit and would not buy it again if we knew ahead of time the troubles it was going to cause."
3,OK but not as great as expected,"I have used many products that are supposed to get out pet stains and odors. Most work well on stains but for odor..well... I have yet to find one that outshines the rest - including Stink-Free. It's OK but after several applications to my kitty's one mistake (infact I used most of the bottle for that one soil), I could still smell a slight urine odor and if I could, I know my cat will too. I'll continue looking...."
3,Not the best,"I bought this product with high hopes. Our cat had difficulty adjusting to a move and wet the bedroom carpet repeatedly. Whiel the intital use of the prodcut seemed to go well (the product's smell was okay and it seemed to cover the urine odor), once it dried in, there was a still signiifcant residual urine smell. We re-used the product a number of times, with the same result - each time letting it dry thoroughly as the package directed. I would recommend Nature's Miracle instead."
1,If You Like Over Powering Baby Powder Scent...,"....You'll LOVE this product. After reading many of the outstanding reviews for this product I was certain it would work for me. I have an older dog who had a couple of accidents on the carpet. Keep in mind, the accidents were treated right after they occurred so they weren't just sitting there stinking for days/months before I got to them. I thought for sure Stink Free would take care of the lingering smell. As suggested, I poured on Stink Free and let it sit. Oh. My. God. The perfume scent was SO overwhelming I got a headache and ended up bunking on the couch to get away from the bedroom! That's not even the worst part. After the product dried I sniffed the accident spots and now they smelled like urine AND baby powder. GAG! It's now 3 days and one steam cleaning later and even though the urine smell is gone the baby powder scent still floats in the air. I won't be using Stink Free again but I hope it works for you."
2,Gagging perfume smell,"I bought this product and sprayed the entire 16-ounce container over a roughly 6 foot square area. The ""fresh scent"" fragrance was so overwhelming that I had to open windows and windows to try to air it out. Finally, I gave up and bought a different odor remover product just to help eliminate the horrible smell from the StinkFree. Perhaps other raters bought a non ""fresh scent"" product, but I thought this was dreadful."
1,Guarantee not honored,"I purchased Stink free for a strong cat carpet odor that I could not remove. I used the whole bottle, and it never removed the odor.Stink Free offers a money-back guarantee if the product fails to remove the urine odor. I followed the instructions on their website to request a refund. It has been a few months, and I have never heard back from them. Apparently, their ""guarantee"" is a scam. Don't waste your money."
5,Amazing product!!,"We just moved into a house where the previous owner must have had issues with their pets having accidents on the carpet. Our foster kitty decided to add to the problem, particularly in the spare bedroom. I was at my wit's end trying to find a product to eliminate the smell. I found Stink Free and saw that they guaranteed the odor removal. I used it on the carpet and a couple of days later, all the urine smell was gone.This has been the best urine-odor removal product I've found (and I've tried just about them all).I'm really very happy with this and have ordered more...for just in case.Anyone who is looking for a tried and true odor remover should use Stink Free."
1,Stink free didn't work for me,I applied stink free generously as recommended in many posts. The end result: The treated areas still stink like cat pee. Perhaps this product works for one-time pee areas. In my case I was taking in a cat for someone for a month and the cat must have peed over and over in the same couple areas making it impossible to get out. I even removed the carpeting and treated the padding. Still no good. I will now be replacing rather than treating the area.
1,This Book is Worst than Illness,"I found this to be the worst text book I have ever had to read, the test questions it offers, are based on one sentence out of each chapter rather than concepts.It has no underlying themes rather than any one of an ethnic minorityMUST have poor health which is of itself racist and discriminating. I would completely disagree by saying that I know plenty of healthy people who are of minority statuses.The book is extremely boring to read and I agree with the first review, it just very repetetive and does not explain any concept in its own words."
5,Only God's opinion matters,"In a world where we are all judged over things we can't control, (physical characteristics, intelligence, accidents) this is a great book for all ages to realize our value in the eyes of God. He made us, He loves us, so why should we let the opinions of others shape our self-image. I love ""You are Special"" in the English version, so I bought the Spanish version to share with children in Ecuador. The message is needed there, too."
4,"A Classic, but not Bing's best.","While I consider Bells of St. Mary's as a classic and enjoy all of the movies in which Bing Crosby stars, I feels that the story line develops a little slowly. Among those which I enjoy more are: Holiday Inn (an annual holiday season viewing) w/ Fred Estaire, Going My Way (w/ Barry Fitzgerald) and White Christmas (w/ Danny Kaye). Buy the collection, you'll enjoy them all"

1,Ordered Bells of St Mary but received Black Stallion,I ordered one thing but you sent The Black Stallion. I gave it away to a friend and went to Target and purchased Bells of St Mary.
5,Christmas Classic at its Best!,I received this in perfect time.This is one of my favorite all time Christmas movies.I had it on VHS and was so happy to find it in DVD.I watch this movie every year after watching Its a Wonderful Life!It is on the marquis as George is running down the street!A classic at its best......a must see movie!
5,Classic Movie...Must See!,"This is a classic movie suitable for all ages. I watch it every Christmas, but really you can watch it anytime. They just don't make them like this anymore."
2,Bells of St Mary's Beware,"If you buy this DVD expecting it to be the video on disc, you will be quite disappointed. Within the first five minutes you'll discover that a scene has been cut. I purchased this version as part of transitioning our holiday film collection to disc from video and I'm quite disappointed."
4,It has Bing Crosby,"And for that reason is a good film. As a sequel to thehit, "" Going My Way "", this movie disappoints. Takensolely on its own merit, it is a good and entertainingfilm. This is not a movie for action buffs, or for thosewith short attention spans. This is a movie for peoplewho enjoy classic movies with great actors, and who donot mind a slower paced film. Just seeing the dog followMr. Bogardis into church is worth the purchase price."
2,Just too slow,Was anticipating a much better movie. Very disappointed. Sure it has a following but just didn't work for me. Slow.
4,It is what it is,"I purchased this movie, along with White Christmas, as a gift for my 93 year old mother. She loves it - especially the colorized feature. I am sure that a serious movie buff would find issues with the colorization, the acting, and the story line - but an elderly woman who grew up in another time zone loves it, and that is all that is important to me."
3,The Bells of St. Mary's,Arrived in a timely mannorProduct in good shapeNo complaints!My boyfriend requested this movie for Christmas. And I am so glad we got it!Old and sweet. Bing Crosby and Ingrib bergman are wonderful in this classic christmas tale.Recomended for all ages
4,Good Sequel To Going My Way,The movie is enjoyable but slow moving in parts. IngridBergman and Joan Carroll stand out in their parts.I wish that I had a nun like Sister Benedict. All of thenuns I had in elementary school were rotten!
4,"""Bells"" Doesn't Resound Like ""Going My Way""","Good, but not great sequel to ""Going My Way"". Director Leo McCarey seems less surehanded in this effort. The film at times seems draggy. The script by Dudley Nichols, though great in capturing everyday parochial school life, is at times maudlin even saccharine. The saving grace of the film is the towering performances of Bing Crosby returning as Father O'Malley and Ingrid Bergman as Sister Benedict. Crosby may even be better than he was in ""Going My Way"" because there are less musical interludes and more opportunities to grapple the drama. Bergman just shines here. Her character is simultaneously funny yet tough, ultimately endearing. It is a credit to the skills of both Crosby and Bergman that they navigate the schmaltzier elements of the film. If there is one set piece that you take away from the film it's the first-grade production of the nativity. Those kids are just so darn cute."
5,Bells of St. Mary's,"I loved watching this movie when I was a kid. I wanted to share it with my children too. My kids loved it. I thought it my not hold their interest, but they watched the whole thing. A true classic."
5,A beautiful classic,"This is one of those movies that should be in every collection of holiday movies. It is a nice story, well acted, and belongs right next to ""A Christmas Carol"", and ""Its a Wonderful Life."" The movie tugs at your heart strings and brings the Christmas spirit forth whether you want it to or not. Very highly recommended."
5,The Bells of St. Mary's,"I really enjoyed this video. When I was young there were four families who would gather together sometime during the month to chat, sing, and of course there were refreshments. One of the ladies played the piano and we would sing along with her. She didn't need the music--she played by ear; you would name the song and she played it. One of the songs she played was ""The Bells of St. Mary's"" and I thought it was so pretty. I found out there was a movie with that name so I placed an order for it with Amazon.com and was able to purchase it. Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman are the main characters and for those who enjoy music I wholeheartedly recommend it."
1,Ring Ring,"got it for my dad didnt watch it, he says its good and rminds him of the old days of cinema."
5,Great Movie!,Loved this movie! would recommend it to any one! I like to watch this around Christmas time cause it really gives you something you cvan watch that has the joy of the season!
5,WOW,I bought this DVD for my mom. She received it a few days after I placed my order. Very Quick service and a smile on her face made this all woth it.
3,Not a cowboy,"It started out with an intriguing concept, but lost the initial thread when the story backtracked and the focus changed. Could have been an interesting idea, but too many loose ends. Not exactly what I expected and I had a hard time finishing it."
4,An interesting collection of essays - 4 *,"This book consists of 12 essays, written by such important personages as Bertrand Russel, Hermann Bondi, Edward Condon, Julian Huxley and Erich Fromm. These essays were written for a general audience, but one that was not afraid of some math, physics and a few chemical symbols. For the most part they detail some of the history of their subject and a little about it. The big negative is the age of the book. Being originally written in 1955 (the hardcover version), much of the content is seriously out of date. This is especially true of the Bondi's Astronomy and Cosmology chapter. Thus, I could only rate the book 4 stars."
4,Good Buy,"Quality machine for the money. Easy to assemble with good directions.The control console is confusing, so be sure and read the manual.I recommend this product."
3,The author and Elizabeth I are in a rut!,"Here's another Karen Harper mystery in which someone gets killed, Elizabeth I gets in a snit and starts suspecting all of her close friends, and alternately smiles or tears up at a moment's notice. The Queene's Christmas is not a good Christmas present!"
5,Better than expected,The book I ordered arrived in a short amount of time and it was in better shape than I expected since it was a used book. I would definitely order from this company again.
3,triangle reflectors,When we recieved this the box was missing a latch and one of the triangle reflectors was missing some parts which my husband went to the local hardware and bought the parts that were needed to fix it.
4,Solid but HUGE,"These are not small triangles, they are well built and worth the money, but if you are looking to save some space these are not for you."
2,Outdated websites,"Although this book does have some great websites, it's finding them that I found to be the main problem. Easily 40% of the websites are outdated and no longer exist. If I hadn't of had the patience to literally go through every single website, the book would have been pratcially useless. With that in mind, the websites that I did find were GREAT and well worth sifting through the book to find them!"
1,A Far Cry From Informative...,"I bought this book after reading Homeschooling on a Shoestring, and was thoroughly disappointed. I'd estimate that eighty-five percent of the websites listed either didn't work or were something other than what the author thought they were. The other fifteen percent I was already aware of from Homeschooling on a Shoestring. I strongly recommend you to bypass this book. Also, there is a strong christian fundamentalist vibe in this book, so if you aren't a fundamentalist, that would be another reason to avoid it."
1,Waste of time and money,"I would just like to echo everyone else who said this book was a waste of time and money. I was also very excited to find this book, but found out very quickly what a joke it was! Almost none of the websites existed anymore, and the ones that do now require a paid membership. You would be better off just researching curricula and paying for those. I partly blame myself for wasting my time on this book. I should have looked at the copyright date, which is 2000. Anyone that knows the Web would know this is EXTREMELY outdated. I would have saved myself a lot of time had I just looked at that first. Thankfully, I was at least able to recoup what it cost by returning the book."
1,Out of date,"I am looking at homeschooling my 6 year old twins, after a rough kindergarten year in public school. I saw this book and thought ""this is perfect."" Luckily, I was able to get a copy through my local library because I was completely disappointed in this book. I found more than 30 websites that I wanted to look at in the first few chapters, but when I started looking them up less than 10 were still online or free. I gave up on the book after that."
5,Educational & well worth the price!,"I could not believe the wealth of sources & ratings - and honesty, with which this book as been compiled. Great investment - even if you want to advance you own learning."
3,Outdated,"This book was probably really great when it was published in 2000, but when I went to check out the websites, especially in the curriculum section, nearly all of them are either dead or now charge for their services. It would be great if the publishers would print an updated version.I'm taking my copy back to the store."
3,some good sites but...,The author does list many good sites but she hasn't kept up with her web site and A LOT of the sites are no longer valid. I've had just as much success helping my child to read by using the free Dolch lesson plans and the free DIBELS downloads available to anyone who cares to google.
2,not free and not accurate,I always read the reviews before I purchase but didn't. I sure wish I would have! I have just tried many links listed.... finally the last one worked but everything on the site cost $$$$. Don't waste your $$.
2,Out-of-date & cumbersome,"I bought this book shortly after publication and even then a decent amount of websites were already outdated. Seven years later I picked up the book again to find almsot everything I was interested in was out-of-date as well. Seven years ago the book had a place but with the power of today's internet search engines this book is not needed. It's cumbersome to use as well, it's not always easy to copy the super huge URLs from the book to the computer."
3,So-so as a homeschooling resource,"""Good parents homeschool their children."" So reads the first sentence of this book. I was a bit put off by that, knowing many good parents who send their children to public and private school. However, once I got past the blatantly erroneous educational view of the author, I found quite a few helpful hints and websites. Yes, I would say that I have found that 30-40% of the websites are no longer available, but the ones that are still working have some great information.In addition to copious website listings, there are also suggestions gleaned from other homeschooling parents on ways to promote social interaction, civic-mindedness, appreciation of the arts, and physical activity.The book would be better if all, or at least most, of the websites were current, but I have found the book to be somewhat helpful."
3,Interesting,"It's interesting to compare the rebuilding of ground zero to that of other cities, and puts the destruction of the WTC in perspective. Having worked for a large 9/11 relief fund, I know first hand how grieving families are preoccupied with what will become of Ground Zero and even its smallest particles of dust (thought to be the remains of loved ones.) Tying together memorialization and urbanization in this way is a great concept -this NY public space will always be personal for us at many levels.Having said that, the design is a bit overdone. You don't know where to look with its melange of maps, colors and varying text sizes. Clearly intended for those with a design eye, as opposed to those more interested in the social and political perspectives."
5,Laurel and Hardy's Best Musical Film,This film was very enjoyable to watch. It remains one of my most favorite Laurel and Hardy comedies. I also liked the costumes and the hair styles. The Devil's brother is filled with laughs as Laurel and Hardy try to be bandits for Fra Diavolo. I highly recommend this film for Laurel and Hardy buffs.
5,Another Crais Winner,"Free Fall was another entertaining novel by Robert Crais. Lots of action with humor and the triumph of good over evil. And a love story, too. The only thing I would have changed was having Joe Pike play a more active role, instead of just being in a minor supportive role."
3,"ok, not spectacular","Robert Crais is doing his best to imitate Robert B. Parker in the Elvis series. Elvis = Spenser, Pike = Hawk, LA = Boston, you get the formula. The story was OK, and even got a little exciting in the end as Elvis and friends turn into ghetto versions of Rambo. I found it too hard to believe that Elvis managed to get out of trouble with the cops so easily."
3,Not Believeable but Entertaining,"This is not the strongest of Crais' work (try LA Requiem for that), but it is solid entertainment, and a good, fast read.While there is plenty of action, as is expected from Crais, he seems to be trying just a bit too hard in ""Free Fall"". Cole's wise-cracking is a little overdone, stretching credibility, as do some of the scenes, particularly the escape from jail. Also, unless I was not paying attention well enough, there seem to be some loose ends that are never resolved (like the red 36C?). The bad guys - inluding both the cops and the south-central LA gang-bangers - feel somewhat rushed in development and have little depth; more stereotyped than I've come to expect from Crais.But the bodies keep piling up and the pages keep turning. On balance, if you're not expecting a classic, and don't want to do much thinking, ""Free Fall"" won't disappoint. A definite choice for a coast-to-coast flight or an afternoon on the beach."
3,Free Fall,"Robert Crais is one of my favorite authors;I always look forward to reading one of his books. If you have never read one then don't start with this one,it doesn't have the writing quality of his other novels. It almost seemed like it was written by a Crais ""wanna-be"". I checked the copyright to see if it was his first Elvis Cole book,thought that might explain the lack of pizazz. As Randy Jackson would say,""It just didn't do it for me."""
5,Not up to par . . .,This installment in the Elvis Cole series is not up to the usual standards of Robert Crais. The story line is good but some of the action is just too hard to swallow. And Elvis is losing a little bit of his snap.
4,Free fall +,Riveting story line. Compelled to keep turning the pages. Look forward to the next Elvis Cole and Joe Pike adventure
5,Crais's best recent work,"Not quite as outstanding as The Monkey's Raincoat or Watchman, but a very enjoyable read. Wouldn't we all like to have a friend like Joe Pike to have our backs whenever things get tough?"
4,Hooked on Robert Crais!,Typical Crais novel with entertainig story mixed with lots of ups and downs and page turning action. Elvis andPike are the best duo since Batman and Robin.
5,Read them all,Elvis is funny and cheesy and entertaining all at the same time - the story is decent and the characters fun
4,free fall,"I really enjoy all of Robert Crais ""Elvis"" books. I can't get enough of that character. I have also discovered ""Joe Pike"". Married to a Vietnam Vet & having a brother that was a homicide detective, I find these books right up my ally. Pure joy."
4,Elvis Cole and Joe Pike take on the LAPD!,"Elvis cracks me up! A woman wants him to investigate her boyfriend, who happens to be a member of the LAPD's elite REACT squad. The trails leads to South Central L.A. where Elvis must deftly navigate through gang land. I enjoyed every minute of this book. Crais' pace is right on target and every touch of humor is refreshing. I liked this better than his first book, ""The Monkey's Raincoat."""
4,I Like It,"Elvis Cole, the lovable private investigator with a sense of humour and a heart returned with his partner, Joe Pike to help his client, Jennifer, find out what was the problem that seemed to big for her fianc?to solve. Like all Elvis Cole novels, we could expect that the case would not be too simple or straightforward for Elvis and Joe. The thrill lies in joining Elvis and Joe in a roller-coaster ride as they set out to unravel the mystery and to get out of the mess they soon find themselves in.This is the fifth Elvis Cole novel which I have read and I am determined to read all of them. Occasionally I find books in which the plot and characters are equally attractive. This is one of them."
4,Great fun!,This show will keep you in stitches and entertained for hours! The fourth season is just as good as the three before it and it's a shame it had to be the last. The DVD's are good and clear pictures and the extras are fun.
5,"GREAT SHOW, SEVERLY UNDER RATED",Word on the street is that they won't be releasing season 5 due to sales dropping for the last few seasons. It's too bad that Anchor Bay doesn't understand that the show declined and wasn't as good the last few seasons as the first few so it makes sense that the sales would drop. It's too bad that it's all about the money because fans suffer. I am sure Boy Meets World fans know what I am talking about.
3,WIld and Sexy,"I got these for my goth Halloween costume. The zebra stripes look totally glam, wild, and sexy with my outfit. I have to wear leggings underneath them since they're sheer enough to see a panty through and I'm not going to wear anything over them. Since the pattern is printed on, after you stretch them on the black stripes look more grey than black, but they still look okay."
2,Escuchemos a Edith Mathis....,"La estrella de esta funcion 'live' de Salzburgo, de 1974, es la soprano EDITH MATHIS, una Pamina dulce y maravillosamente cantada, de las mejores de la discografia. El Tamino 'a lo heroico' de RENE KOLLO canta Mozart como si se tratase de Wagner: incapaz de transmitir sensibilidad, y francamente fuera de sitio en este papel. La Reina de la Noche de EDITA GRUBEROVA rinde a gran nivel, aunque algun agudo no sale todo lo limpio que debiera. Notable el Papageno de HERMANN PREY, y un escalon por debajo el Sarastro de PETER MEVEN. Un lujo contar con JOSE VAN DAM para el papel de Orador. Completan el reparto de nombres conocidos la insuficiente Papagena de RERI GRIST y la segunda Dama de TRUDILESSE SCHDMIDT. Conviene citar tambien al casi inaudible Monostatos de GERHARD UNGER. KARAJAN y la FILARMONICA DE VIENA son siempre una solida garantia de calidad. El sonido es bastante bueno, aunque a veces quedan deslucidos algunos conjuntos, como el inicial de las Tres Damas."
2,Get the metal one instead of the plastic one,"I got the metal version of this mug at the same time as the plastic one, and the metal one is way better. When I pour my tea water into the plastic container, I can hear it creaking, which doesn't bode well. Despite not filling it past the fill line, when I screw the lid on (keeping the spout open as instructed) it spits hot water out of the crease. Next the plastic becomes too hot to hold until it cools down, at which point the tea is no longer as warm as I would like it. I find it just too dangerous to use with hot liquids. I still give it two stars because I find it to be safe and spill proof but only when I am using it with cold drinks. For my hot drinks, I choose the metal one."
1,Big dissapointment,"The coffee in this mug acquires the taste and smell of rubber, which overweighs for me all the good things about it. I did not use any strong detergents, only a dishwasher liquid. The manufacturers that produce any food or drink related staff have to be hold to some basic safety standards.I will not recommend this travel mug."
4,useful but too small,"this mug is awesome. When sealed I can just toss it to the passenger seat, let it roll around and it doesn't leak anything. Also nice to carry around because I can put it in my jacket and not have to worry about leaking.I bought the brush aluminium one, my Dad saw and like it. I gave it to him.I replace it with this green one. They're both good. So I think this is a better value.The only downside, and hence the 4 stars, it is too small. 14oz is not enough for even a short trip."
4,Great travel mug but does not keep beverages hot for long...,"This is a great travel mug! The design is sleek and attractive and it really is spill proof. Just click the button on the lid to open it, sip away, then click it again to seal it. Turn it upside down, shake it - it won't leak. (Leaks only occur if you take a sip then quickly click the button to seal it. This causes a small amount of liquid to be caught in the lid which can leak out.)Clean up is easy and the size accommodates this particular java junkie who requires a large cup of coffee in the morning.My only complaint is that it does not keep my coffee hot for a long time. It's good for about 30 minutes to an hour before the coffee becomes luke warm. I just rewarm my coffee when I get to work.Still worth the purchase as the pros outweigh the cons."
3,It leaks,"This cup is an OK travel mug but not one of the best I have had. It doesn't keep liquids warm for any length of time and it leaks. The biggest problem I have with it is because the way it is designed, the lid is hard to get completely dry. I just about threw up when I had washed, put it in the cabinet for about 2 weeks, went to take a sip and the first thing that came out was old dish water that tasted and smelled funny. Ew! They need a better design for the lid."
3,not enough MADEA,"I love the MADEA movies, but this one less of her, the main character, i would have liked to have seen more of Madea in this DVD!"
3,Christy,I received this movie and found out that the product was the play for madea goes to jail. I really wanted the movie but the play was ok. The play was completely different from the movie but i think i still like the movie better than the play.
2,Waste of time,This is a waste of time. Tyler Perry tries to make a funny movie with family drama and after school special lesson at the end. Either be funny or be after school special. I didn't get it and I was very hopeful that it would be great because I've heard so many good things about these movies. Stick with Eddie Murphy and the greats for comedy!
4,A small slice of life served up with a generous helping of laughs,"When you hear that Tyler Perry is debuting a new movie featuring the character of Madea, you become like a thirsty man in the desert who spots an oasis in the distance. You know that if you can just get there, you will be so refreshed with laughter. There is a hilarity that infuses your senses that you don't want to let go when Madea is breakin it down and servin it up as only she can....And the life stories that accompany this trip do give us food for thought...Thank you Tyler Perry!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I found this movie very disappointing. Which is surprising as Madea goes to jail the play is one of my favorites of Tyler's plays.This movie however strayed too far away from that premise. The sub-plot and plot were not cohesive. It was almost like watching two different movies.I would have enjoyed it more if Keisha's character had some interaction with Madea prior to going to jail. Especially since they did not go to jail until 3/4 into the movie. Prior to that, there was no connection between those people and what was going on with Madea. It was just random."
4,Funny movie,I watched this movie several times on DVD and I found that mostly the first half is funnier than the second half where it could be so predictable!Compared to the Madea family reunion movie it is funnier.
4,Madea's at it again!!,"Tyler Perry is back with Madea finally getting her due, or does she? With her same bodacious personality, Madea and Joe never miss a beat. This movie is funny with some thought provoking moments. Also, see another side of the Cosby kid. Thanks Tyler, entertaining as always."
3,Madea Goes To Jail,I was looking for the movie - but this is actually the play. Description wasn't very clear that this wasn't the movie.
3,Okay...,"It was a funny movie. A friend recommended it to me. We had a good time, however, I appreciate other type of movies better."
5,Movie Review,"Very funny intertaining movie, made my road trip not seem so long. Will buy other Tyler Perry movies for my Kindle Fire in the future."
4,Funny stuff,Another funny Madea show from Tyler Perry. Always do enjoy his stuff. He is really good at playing Madea. Some bad language but for adults is fine.
2,"It only went half way and the DVD played up and not able to watch them remaining story line,",Only got to watch half the movie before the DVD froze so not sure of the rest of the storyline.
5,For Madea Fans,"It was decided long ago that only the Madea DVD,s were desired mainly because of Perry in costume. You will scream at the hilarious momenta in this film and hope it never ends."
2,NOT a comedy.,"Not a very funny film. The trailer was misleading. I was lead to believe that it was a comedy. The film is a good drama, but NOT really a comedy."
1,nooooooooooo,"Like all of the tyler perry's movies he is in, This one is stupid as well. This movie kept me laughing how bad it is. Of course it has its funny moments but they finish fast and continues with the stupidness . which is the main reason as to why I don't buy and watch Perry's movies. If you want to have a good laugh and forget your bad moments don't watch this movie or any of Perry's films for that matter, and you will forget about your worries (for a moment)."
2,okay....,all i have to say is i expected more..the movie was not complete and i hope the next one is better
2,Madea is funny but....,"An okay movie, but like other reviewers mention, it flashes back and forth between drama and comedy, the comedy is great, but the drama really drags this movie down. I rented this with the intention of wanting to laugh. The drama that he adds in both this and madeas family reunion is like filler. A shame he doesn't focus more on the comedy, because when his movies are funny, they are pretty funny."
1,unhappy,I really like Madea and was looking forward to this movie. However little was done by Madea and the plot seemed to be on anything but Madea. I am sorry I purchased this movie. THis is truly not one of Tyler Perry's best.
1,not worth it,"soooooooo not worth it.madea is 5% of the movie and 95% is some lame street drama.i was expecting madea funny stuff,i regret paying 4$ on demand"
3,Madea goes to jail,"Could have been better. The prison stuff wasn't clear. We know why the girls got out, but why was Madea's sentence cut? Some stuff was left on the cutting floor as well, based on some of the previews.I am a Tyler Perry supporter, and still am..... Brown needs more...in any and all movies you place him in. He could have been a piece in the spiritual counseling for the girl or at the prison."
1,unwatchable.,"some of the Madea bits were funny, but the other story line about the hookers really was the movie...Madea was more of a sub-sub plot ...it takes 1:10 min for her to get to jaili couldn't even finish it..."
2,That was Painful,"Wow...Wish I had my one and a half hours of life and $3.99 back. That was one bad movie. Save your time and enjoy the trailer, because it contains ALL the funny parts of this movie. I surly would not label this movie a comedy. There are too many storylines going along at once and none of them converge to make a solid movie. I really like Tyler Perry and his concept of Madea, but this movie so under uses her that she could have been a supporting role instead of the lead. Honestly, the best part of this film is during the final credit roll up with an out take scene with Medea and Dr. Phil."
3,hardly any of the funny,"I was let down by this movie. New to the Madea films this was the second one i chose to watch,not a good choice. Glad i didn't pay over $2 to watch it. This movie was more serious and i wanted to laugh. There were two stories in this one movie. Not enough Madea and hello wasn't she supposed to be in jail!"
4,Madea Goes to Jail,I actually got to watch this movie for free with credits given out by Amazon for having a special offers kindle.I thought it was very funny. I love all of the Madea movies.Thank you Amazon for the free movie ! LOVE my special offers Kindle !!
2,"Initially a good TV, but then....",We have owned this TV for under 5 years. It has been a fairly decent TV until just recently. We started having problems where the TV screen would go red and then shut off. It started happening more frequently until now we can't even get the TV on for a second. After some online research and talking to a TV repair man it turns out that the red bulb went bad and they don't make the bulbs anymore or a replacement. This seems to be a fairly common problem with this TV from visiting online forums.
4,The Lawyer's Son,"I really enjoyed this book. The only thing that I think should be changed is that it doesn't develop the character of Brad, which the book is named after. I think it should focus on his and Jason's character more. Plus, the beginning was just a little bit too detailed, but all in one I enjoyed it and was able to read it in just 3 days. I am looking forward to Mr.Taylor's next book."
5,BRAVO!,"Hi. I'm Jeanette Mills. I just finished the book, ""The Lawyer's Son"" and I loved it. Usually, I do not read fiction. Primarily, I read autobiographies and non-fiction books. But I must say my niece told me about this book and I could'nt put it down. I really enjoyed this book and I just want this young man to keep on keep'in on. I can't wait until the next book. 5 stars!"
3,3 1/2 stars,"See storyline above.Labyrinth is one of those stories that you seem to be able to read in a day, only because it's made for a speed reader. There are many parts you can just glance over. There are only so many things you can describe about a cave chase scene. Predictable falls, trips, slides, and cave ins. The saving grace, obviously, was the mad scientist and his search for the moon rock.The premise of using this mostly unexplored cave for the practice of moon miners seemed somewhat silly. Would not regular mines suffice? They're dark."
2,Ripped off!,"One of the bottles was COMPLETELY empty upon arrival. It wasn't as if someone had used it, but rather like it had never been filled. I'm looking into Amazon's return policy, but since it was a gift, I'll probably just end up keeping it as it is. The other three fragrances smell delightful, but I'm very unhappy about the missing perfume."
1,a total POS,"I ordered a Sony DPF-D80 8-Inch, but didn't like it 100% because of the lacking wireless and inability to play videos. I thought, this Digital Spectrum frame would be better. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a total piece of junk:- it's big and disproportionally ugly (frame, inside a frame, inside a frame - the default Amazon image is showing a 10-inch model, I think)- image quality is horrible, both, in terms of resolution, and lack of color depth- the video feature is unusable - jerky and stops with errorsI didn't even try the wireless feature, since there is no way I'm going to keep this frame.Compared to Sony DPF-D80 8-Inch, the Digital Spectrum frame is an ugly monster."
3,Good,Good CD however it has a lot more live performance bits than I thought there would be. still pretty enjoyable
5,Best of the Best !,The kind of talent that he had makes me truly sad that we didn't get to really see him develop into what was the next TRULY great stand up comedian. YES ROBIN we'll always miss you my friend.
5,IN RARE FORM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I REMEMBER THIS WHEN HE PERFORMED ON HBO AND IT WAS EXCELLENT!!!!THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER LIKE HARRIS. ALL HE NEEDED WAS A LITTLE AND YOU WERE PULLED IN HEAD FIRST. A MAN BEFORE HIS TIME.
5,"Brilliant, wonderful and TOO black","I first became aware of Robin through Spike Lee's movies, ""Do the Right Thing"" and ""Mo' Better Blues."" Then I was reading one of Spike's books and he told of how he discovered Harris. When he first heard him, he thought ""this guy is TOO black!"" Which, of course, is what makes him so funny.One thing that's endearing about this recording is that at first listen, it can be hard to make out some of his words, if you're not used to a thick African-American accent and street dialect. But after a few listening sessions, the words become clear.It's a shame that this is his only recording. Check out those movies if you want to see other brief but shining examples of Robin Harris."
5,Eyes watering funny.,You don't listen to this thinking it is a comedy routine. Robin Harris sounds like a friend of the family or in the barber shop crack jokes.
1,BE-BE KIDS,"I placed this order on Jan.25,2002 , I have inquired about it before if you do not have the item in stock could you please refund my money, its very obvious that you dont have it because if you did I would have it by now.Its seems as though this is the only way i can contact you about this issue.Thank you,mother of alishea tucker"
2,Didn't work very well,My son was excited to get this for christmas. After we opened it and put it together it just never worked the way it was designed. The arrows launcher never held the arrows. As soon as you tried to load them they would fly out. The shuriken launcer was cumbersome and difficult to use. He pretty much gave up on it after a few days and now it's gathering dust in our closet.
2,A big disappointment,"Doesn't fit well on my son's wrist. It is difficult to close, and when worn the thumb trigger only works 10% of the time. I think he's played with this once since getting it for Christmas."
5,Shonen Jump: Naruto Rapid Attack Gloves,"Any child who is into Naruto is going to love this item - parents may not understand it, but the kids do & they have a blast using both the gloves & their imaginations!"
5,wow,Wow is all that needs to be said this is the realest book written to date if you can't feel this your not living. D.L. keep bringing the heat and you will be on top of the game in no time matter fact you already are.
4,Snake Pit,"D. L. Moore's book centers on a the main character Cee, a young playa who is somewhat satisfied in the street game. Off the top, the love of his life, Keisha, is gunned down in a botched robbery at his apartment, before he gets a chance to ask her to be his wife. The story revolves around an unknown arch enemy trying to kill Cee throughout the book, concluding with an interesting surprise added with a twist. The bottomline: you ""gotta"" know how to maneuver in a pit of snakes without getting bitten, paralyzed or squeezed to death. This book lives up to it's title. Good job, D. L.!"
5,Dzogchen from a down to earth view,"This book presents the only description of the stages of the path in a down to earth way. The path is personal development, starts where you are, and proceeds as far as you want to go. The personal stories both indicate what is possible, that actual people do these things and a warmth that is not found in the ""perfect expression"" scriptural descriptions of reality. The ""Union of"" view is presented in a genuinely helpful way."
3,"Interesting, but not very well written","There are some useful results in this book. It has an especially good section on statistical techniques for data cleanup and making sure you have a clean tick series. Also, there are some interesting pieces on how to handle the discontinuous nature of tick data as opposed to what you see with daily data. Unfortunately, the book is written in a style that is hard to follow so that even standard results seem somewhat obscure the way the authors present them. Also, the notation is a pain, as noted by other reviewers they use a kind of computer notation rather than standard statistical notation making many of the forumulae much more difficult to read than they should be. Overall, a good book but it suffers from a poor writing style and is getting to be somewhat dated."
3,FX Only!,"The tools described in this book are actually in mid frequency, not exactly high frequency. And they are specific for FX. If you are looking for truly high frequency strategies for equities, this book is not for you."
5,Great,It's so great- a little short but still a great book! Easy to read and a very great Plot luv it!
2,not what I thought it was,i thought I was getting a book with beautiful pictures in it as described by one reviewer. I got a very very short story--no illustrations. Not what I expected.
2,Not so good.,This book was okay but not quite what I enjoyed. It id nice but not as good as others. I guess for me it was just a bit too boring.
1,Disappointed,"The story of Beauty and the Beast has to be my all time favorite fairy tail, but this book is horrid! I bought the free Kindle version and my, am I glad it was free, I would not pay good money for this version. The story is SUPER condensed, very choppy and not at all flowing. At odd points in the story there would be a line saying something like, ""Do you love me?"". I can only guess that there was suppose to be an illustration there and that it was taken out. There where also a lot of words that seemed to be italicized for no reason what so ever. All in all, I am very disappointed with this version."
5,Beauty and the Beast,"I ordered this book to read to my daughter, because she loved the movie. I was thankful that it was offered as a mobile issue so even when we aren't home I can read to her. Timeless classic childrens story that can travel with you on your cellphone, no need to lug heavy books!!"
5,A good book,It's shorter than the movie but it's a really good book if your thinking of buying this book read it it's a good book with good romance
4,Beauty&Beast,"I absolutely love beauty and the beast, this has always been my favorite movie now I got the chance to read the book !!"
4,Beauty and the Beast,"A fairytale story told in a traditional fashion, of a prince changed into a beast. After the father trespasses, then steals a rose, Beauty offers to be a captive in his place, and the story continues to Happily Ever After."
4,Beautiful book,Bought this as a gift because of the beauty of the pictures. Very unusual book -- not your normal disney-type telling and illustration of the story. Liked it.
3,I expected more,"i thought there would be more to this, but I was mistaken. It was a decent short story, but I wouldnt bother reading it unless you wanted to pound out a quick bedtime story"
5,Visual and succint: less then 400 pages.,The author took less then 400 pages to give a very in depth discovery of Perl 5 while other books took twice as much. There is a section called the discovery center that is like a pocket reference. The book uses lots of visual diagrams to describe esoteric Perl syntax and symantics. For example the description of the @_ system variable is most simple and complete comparing to several other books.
3,Good but not great,"Good solid foundation. Not enough advanced examples, specially for regular expressions."
2,hmmm good effort,"This was a good effort, but there are more technical books out there on the markey now, and this would have been great five years ago. Hacking, programming network security and all it encompasses can't be explained in one book. many researchers look toward the ACM papers for technical explanations.When Computer Hacking: Detection and Protection, came out I loved it. It shone some light of the mystical journey a hacker takes, and gave away technical detail too.This book by Dr.K is all too simular, and not enough technically, to produce a worthy 4/5 star book. Today's hacking books need to get up and close to the hacker and shed more technical light than a maths book!"
1,a waste of money and time,"While the author seems to know a lot about many of the topics he writes about, he, alas, does not know how to write well about them. Therefore, this book is neither of interest to bad guys (crackers) nor to good guys."
1,What!?,"I bought this book a while back... as in years. Even then the information was so dated that you couldn't really get all that much information from it. Only way I'd pick it up is if I wanted to take a look back and dream of the old days, or learn how things might have worked if technology and methodology had not advanced."
3,satoshi tomiie nubreed,"there is no doubt that satoshi tomiie has an amazing ability to extract the deep dark sound that entices us fans. However, i feel that this album does not reflect his true potential and does not compare to the other nubreeders such as, danny howells, sander kleinenberg, and lawler. i've seen him live in L.A. twice and i must say that his live set has much more energy than this album. for some reason there seems to have a lack of progression and an over ubundance of cheeze voclas(yuck). i'd recomend this album only for the harcore fan but, dont miss out to see him live if you get the chance."
5,An author is born,"I rarely pay hardcover prices but after accidentally catching a few minutes of Ms. Weaver at a local reading (I sat down and stayed until the end - as did many other browsers), I immediately bought three copies for friends. Her witty observations in Unzipped are not to be missed, and her unique vantage point affords us all a good seat in the human comedy. Treat yourself to this delightful debut...."
3,"I like it, it's just that...","...I like the ones made with real metal. I would recommend this for the younger children who watch Naruto (If there are any. I think the show is more for children 10+). But the metal ones can be very dangerous. So if you're a young fan of Naruto, this is a great deal for you!"
3,Small,This headband is small. This is not the same size as the metal one. This is more of an toy then the real one. More for kids under 8.
3,great cd!,This is an awesome christmas cd. Delivered fast. Only problem was cd case was cracked in several places.
3,I like the screen but the quality doesn't match the price,"I bought this to help divide up my living room and while it does that quite well (it's really big), it's a little on the pricey side for the quality. The wood in the frame was warped right out of the box. Other than that it's alright, but I suspect you could pick up a similar quality item for half the price at a flea-market or outlet type store. I thought I was getting a much higher quality product than what arrived."
1,Rita was right!,"This is not a book for the 3-7 age bracket. Age 3 maybe, but that's it. Rita was right. Wish I had read her review sooner."
3,Not quite as expected.,"Not a bad book (for its price), but you should note the following:1 It's a facsimile of the Second edition, published in 1912. As you'd expect from a book that's almost a century old, the writing is somewhat dated and can be difficult to follow at times. Similarly, neither the number nor the quality of the illustrations is what one would expect in a modern book.2 Despite its title, the book is, in fact, entirely concerned with Celtic art in Great Britain and Ireland. Continental art receives no attention whatsoever."
2,Only 3 scale modes. For classical training.,"This book only gives scales and exercises in C major, C minor harmonic, and C minor melodic. There are a zillion exercises as well as multiple fingerings shown for each scale. All of the fingering are uncommon and complex compared to what I already knew. Common, easy patterns are not there. I was disappointed there are no pentatonic, blues, or other more popular scales."
3,Marmite is,"..not quite as terrible as people say. I could see myself liking this on toast eventually. It's salty, malty and beefy-ish. If you use just a little bit on toast with some butter, it's not too bad."
3,Not for me,"Wanted to try it, so I tried it. The flavor is incredibly concentrated- you just need a teeny bit. The best way to describe the flavor would be ""sour, salty beef bouillon""It was fun to try, but it's not for me. Can't really see myself eating this on purpose ever again."
3,Kind of like molasses,"The first thing I had to do was try a bit straight from the jar. It's disgusting. That is not what I bought it for however, so I still had hope since I would be mixing it with other things.I recently became semi vegetarian and have a great recipe for meatless hamburgers that called for this. I had never tried or heard of it before, and couldn't find it in time for my first round of burgers. So I ordered it online and used it with the second batch.Marmite made a large and yet subtle difference. It added a savory undertone to the vegetables that was light but still provided impact, I may even use a bit more next time.I only gave it 3 stars because I don't know what else I would use this with, and it's certainly not something you can just have around to put on any old thing. But for the recipe I did use it with I think it was magical."
3,I am neither British nor Australian,I expect that the jar I received(sealed and within sell by date) was in top shape and a credit to the brand. I must then conclude that I do not at all care for Marmite and will not purchase it in the future.fast shipping though.
5,Not Happy.,Had to 5 star it to enter my review.Not at all like the Marmite iv been eating.Color&texture was wrong.Glad to return it.I wont order another.
4,"Unique, Salty, and Powerful","This stuff has a unique flavor that defies comparison. It's salty with a hint of something else not entirely unlike beef flavor. I really like it. A few minutes after eating a teaspoon of this spread on a piece of toast, I found that I could see through walls and telepathically converse with an elderly woman somewhere in the Dakotas."
4,A food of the Gods,"Marmite, so they say, is something you either love or hate. I love it and I'm suspicious of anyone who doesn't like it. What's their problem? Even people who do like it fall into two camps - those who spread it thin, and those who spread it thick. What's the point of thin? You might as well not bother. Thick is best. I like the way it tastes like magical burning salt and makes your mouth hurt when you eat too much of it."
1,Am I eating spoiled Marmite?,"I've been watching a lot of British TV on Netflix lately. Show after show mentions Marmite lovingly. I had to know what all the talk was about. It's possible that the talk is because the British all joke about how bad it tastes. They put this stuff on their toast so, I was expecting jelly or ""marm""alade. Hokey smokes some cultural sensibilities are different! We like you, Britain; glad the Queen has 60 years under her belt and everything. We're glad Marmite is working out well for you but, Americans apparently left for a reason."
3,"Tart, salty and savory","I bought some of this at the Vitamin Cottage after hearing so much about its infamous taste. I think it's too bitter and chalky but the savory aftertaste isnt bad. It tastes like chewing a chlorine tablet and then adding some soy sauce while you chew. It's also very salty as in dumping a salt shaker in your mouth!! It definitely tastes like it's healthy for you if you get my drift. My friend was with me when I was unloading groceries and I had her taste a little dip on a saltine cracker and after eating one bite she subsequently tossed it down the disposal. Well at least it's healthy, albeit nasty tasting, so at least I'm not chucking fatty trash down my gullet when I'm using it up!"
2,too much salt,might have great flavor if i could have gotten beyond the salt. so much for a snack spread. might still work out well as a soup flavoring.
1,NASTY,This stuff is so nasty. I dont see how anyone would want this. I put it on toast and almost threw up. I would rather eat a rat alive than this.
1,Awful Taste!,"I bought this product after reading about the benefits of it from ""First Magazine for Women."" I picked it up at Whole Foods for $5.99 and a total waste of money. The magazine touted it as good for weight loss, because the protein would fill you up and it had a lot of B vitamins. The article said it was good spread on toast. Well the taste is very salty and extremely bitter. You could never spread enough on toast to be filling, because of the awful after taste of bitterness. Also, it is so expensive, you would have to buy a couple of jars a week if you did use it on a daily basis. The taste is like eating a combo of a bunch of anchovies and beef jerky. If you have to watch your sodium, you do not want this. I will not be buying it again."
3,Better for a car than a truck,"These are nice floor moats. A little lightweight and a bit slick if your shoes are damp, But They are Stylish, good looking and very functional However if you are considering getting them for a Ram full size or Van--think again and look at some other options. These mats are a bit smaller than the factory mats which came standard in my Ram 1500. I was able to place these new ones over the Factory standard mats with no problems. The punch outs for hooks (to hold the mats steadily in place)is a very nice feature if your vehicle has said hooks.Overall I recommend these for spicing up your auto, MiniVan or midsize Pickup."
1,Not as described noe does it match picture,"Floor Mats in Picture say ( Dodge ) on the side of them! The ones i recieved say Ram in the middle of them, i ordered them for Viper not a truck. Very disappointed :( this is the 1st item ive recieved through Amazon that hasn't been as describedDodge Factory Style Trim-To-Fit Molded Front Floor Mat - Set of 2"
3,dodge floor mats,The picture is not what you will receive. These mats say ram on them and not dodge as shown in picture. They look good but why cant amazon show the correct item in their photo?
3,"Not the right size, but sturdy and functional.","They don't fit nearly as well as they should, but they should hold up just fine and look good when clean. One year of ownership so far and pleased in general."
5,If you have an EMMA you HAVE to get this book!!,"My daughter received this book from my sister-in-law when she was born. It has been her favorite for awhile! It is a simple book to read, short and very sweet! A good book for parents who like to read to their children. My little Emma just loves it!! :o)"
4,The best Bagdad cuisine cookbook,"Although this is not a new book, this is the best Iraqi cookbook I have found. Particularly if you are looking for Iraqi Jewish cuisine. She writes clearly and her recipes are delicious."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I was slightly disappointed by this cd, & it's hard for me to say that, seeing as I am the biggest Hypocrisy fan I know. Although it has a great selection of songs on it, the 6 remakes are nowhere near the caliber of the originals, or to the versions off of ""Destroy's Wacken Live"" (with the exception of Penetralia). The remakes are saturated in keyboards that just don't fit, & the vocals are oddly produced with odd effects over them. I wonder if Peter still reigns as the best death vocalist. The original demos aren't really worth anything, but I am not really a fan of old Hypocrisy. The song ""Turn The Page"" was an experiment in aggro/nu-metal, & sounds very similar to Slipknot, a band I am not a fan of. I would like to recomend this cd to anyone who has never heard Hypocrisy, but because of the remakes (& failures) of the classics, I would have to tell all the Hypocrisy newbies to go for ""Destorys Wacken Live"", because this is more for regular fans of Hypocrisy."
2,1998 recording,"You would expect a decent quality video recording from 1998.This one is one big failure.Terrible,terrible video.Being Groundhogs fan for almost 40 years I finally appreciate this release of their first ever recorded performance but it should be done with much better recording equipment.Recommended only for the hard cores fans."
2,additional info,"Norris W. Cuney was my great-grandfather. I've only read part of this book, but just want to add that it's also useful because it's one of few published works about NWC. There is a good chapter on him in GALVESTON: A HISTORY OF THE ISLAND, by Gary Cartwright."
5,Learn to play Irish concertina,I couldn't start to play my concertina without this DVD. I highly recommend!!
1,Wasted money,"Not well done, fairly useless ""instruction"" and the guy just blathered on and on with little direction....definitely a future trashcan filler."
5,Excellent fantasy with moral lessons,This is a great series to read together as a family. It will be hard to hold it down to one chapter a day!!
5,Loved the books,I liked these so much I am buying them for many of my friends. They are a fun read and inspiring at the same time.
4,The Spirit Flyer: Magic Bicycle,"I first read this book when I was about 10 years old and often had fond memories of John's exciting adventures on his amazing bicycle. Now re-reading it 10 years on I still enjoyed the overall story but was a little dissapointed in the way it was written: simplified at the onset and very complex at the end. However, overall a wonderful tale with exciting moments and, on a spiritual level, a reminder of the supernatural battle raging for our souls."
1,Disappointed,When I received the pkg the product was leaking. When I went to use the product the pump didn't work.
5,Does the job for my saltwater tank,I was having issues with my saltwater tank evaporating at a rapid rate because my old tops were not snug. After installing the new one I ordered that has no longer been an issue with my saltwater tank.
2,Be careful - for center braced aquariums only,"I orderd this for an older tank that does not have the upper cross brace. This Canopy is for the aquariums WITH the brace.The description does not provide that little (extremely important) tidbit nor does the picture. I had to custom make a piece to go across the middle.There are two 23"" wide hinged pieces of glass in the box."
1,nice product for being the wrong size,this company shipps extremely quick and packaged very nkce. only issue with the product is that it is not the correct size. for a tank with two sextions you need 2 sections that are 22.5x18 not 23x18. im working on having a friend use a glass cutter to correct their screw up. I will never make another purchase from this halfass company.
3,Better than 2 and 3,"So we know what to expect from the Prom Night series by now: cheap and nasty efforts. But this is a lot better than the stupid Prom Night 2 and 3. It's a pity they hadn't done this one before 2 and 3 because Jonas, the killer, is pretty cool and he actually has motives for his madness. If he'd have been in 2 then we would never have heard of Mary Lou (urgh) and this guy would be the star of the sequels. Am I asking for too much with a higher body count? Probably. But this is worth a look. Forget 2 and 3 and pretend they don't exist. Just get this one and the original. You won't be disappointed."
3,"good movie,just not good enough","i liked this movie, im not saying i didnt and it was a hellova lot better than the stupid prom night 3, but it wasnt that good. It was funny at times, and scary at others, but it was sometimes boring to. But this movie does have its scary moments, that's for sure. But if there were few less boring parts, it would have been better. The movie just tries to hard, that's the problem.And it looks pretty cheesy."
4,What's up with Competitive Leadership?,"I originally thought this book was about football. I was wrong. This book is about leadership skills for business. It will help you succeed and become a better leader. Brian Billick is an intelligent author and an outstanding football coach. Billick is the only coach to lead the Baltimore Ravens to a play-off game, not to mention a Super Bowl. 2002 is his second consecutive year to reach the play-offs. The vocabulary is impressive. Enjoy your reading of Competitive Leadership- Twelve Principles for Success."
4,Kids video,Pretty good video for kids. Kids like this video and then grow out of it fast. Worth it to make them happy.
3,Not the best Dora DVD,"I watch all the Dora videos with my daughter, and this one did not hold her interest. Repetitive and not very lively, unfortunately. Not a keeper"
3,Concepts too advanced for my 18 month old.,"My daughter loves Dora and puppies. I like to put a little Dora on so I can get a few things done arond the house. Usually Dora isn't too annoying for me to watch either. This video however I could only watch once and now it is super annoying to me. Also, counting to 100 is a little too advanced for my 18 month old. We like the princess or pirate videos tons better."
1,Broken Belly Ring,After 4 days of wearing the belly ring it broke! The Martini fell off of the actual ring. I am very disappointed!
3,Annoying,Some things are given asgifts and it is impossible to rate them and annoying to be asked to rate items.I have therefore rated some items in order to exit this program despite the fact that I ahve no idea whatthey are like.
2,Just OK.,I like one song on this CD. I doubt I will be playing it much. I wished I had listened to the preview samples of it before purchasing.
4,chop chop (slight return),"This 'Various' person has alot of records out but i'm afraid mr Various cannot take credit for this soundtrack. Karera Musication is basically the Boredoms without Mr. Eye. So it's less noise rock and more i guess eclectic jazz world music sounding but it's still people in the Boredoms. For some reason it reminds me of collaged javanese Jaipong music with electro acoustic sounds. I'd give it 5 stars but the classical instrument noise improv piece at the end of the film is not on the soundtrack. that was the best music from the film. That's mostly why i bought it. If you've heard that 'Rebore' remix album by the Boreoms and that Yoshimi and Yuko album and liked it, you will like this much. It's rare that a movie soundtrack done for the film stands up on it's own."
1,This is a smear job trying to pass off as real literature.,This book is clearly partisan without any objectivity whatsoever. All attempts at actual journalistic integrity totally failed.
1,"how do you like it now, republicans?","well, i wonder if youll be so quick to sing the praises of this trash now that its author has come clean and told the world it was a hatchet job replete with lies.but i guess you folks will just keep up your silly notions..."
3,Interesting new facts,"Now that David Brock has admitted that his book was essentially a compilation of lies about Anita Hill, it obviously takes on new significance. As a book about the Clarence Thomas hearings, it deserved zero stars, since it had all the hallmarks of bad propaganda. Now that we know it was bad propaganda, however, it's worth reading again, just to gain some insight into the techniques of character assissination."
1,AUTHOR ADMITS THIS BOOK IS PURELY CHARACTER ASSASSINATION,"Anita Hill ""A little bit nutty and a little bit slutty""?Brock confesses in Talk magazine that he was on a search-and-destroy mission to serve the Right's mission: DESTROY DEMOCRACY.Brock admits to ``dumping virtually every derogatory--and often contradictory--allegation I had collected on Hill into the vituperative mix.''"
1,Now we know,"David Brock has admitted (or at least claims) that he wrote this book as a hatchet job on Anita Hill and that he actually sank to the point where he visited a potential witness against Thomas and threatened to defame her in his book unless she provided a retraction to disparaging statements she had made against Thomas.As has been said by one of his former cohorts, either he was lying then or he's lying now. Read at your own risk."
1,David Brock admits he was wrong about Anita Hill,"I do not understand why this book is still in print, or at the very least is not published with a huge disclaimer on the front cover. The author himself has admitted in more recent books (_Blinded by the Right_ and others) that he was *lying* when he wrote this book, and that he deliberately spun every piece of information about Anita Hill to discredit her."
4,Solidly researched,"Although hard to follow at times, ""The Real Anita Hill"" blows a barn-sized hole in Anita Hill's testimony. It is also a blistering indictment of the media, who never bothered to track down the details of Hill's life themselves, and of the black intelligentsia, who threw Clarence Thomas to the wolves to save their own hide. A great explanation of the ""Rashomon"" of our time."
2,A Real Shame....,"It's a real shame that I've apparently wasted my time reading almost 100 pages of The Real Anita Hill. At least I didn't buy it. I found it in a local library.After reading a few of the Amazon customer reviews about the book, I was shocked to learn that Brock set out to discredit Hill, and apparently used some shady methods.The entire affair of the Thomas confirmation seems so unbelievable now. That Hill was allowed to give her testimony 10 years after the incidents took place, seems a bit outrageous. When Thomas' confirmation hearings were being televised, I didn't have a tv. However, the part that I did catch on a friend's tube, were just surreal. What a terrible episode of our political history..."
2,"Open Mind, Strong Stomach?","If you have an open mind - and a strong stomach - I recommend reading The Real Anita Hill. However, in order to get a reasonably accurate picture, I recommend that you also read ""Strange Justice"" (ISBN 0-395-63318-4). The combination offer great insight into, not only what happened in 1991, but also of the events since. The combination goes a long way toward explaining the antagonism between the the political parties as well as how it is that they are able to justify their tactics. And also why the make-up of the Federal Courts have been such a priority for the Republican party. Recently the subject has become more pertinent now that Republicans can again make nominations to the Federall Courts. Things are sure to heat up in this area and these two books help explain why."
1,The New Yorker got it right,"just found this in the May 24, 1993 issue of ""The New Yorker"" Magazine: a review of Brock's book by Jane Meyer & Jill Abramson includes...""All nonfiction books contain errors, but this book is unusual in the extent to which its key arguments are based on them.""""At a certain point, a knowledgeable reader begins to wonder how many of these errors are innocent and how many are deliberate distortions.""""Once the sources are evaluated and the contradictory evidence is considered, Brock's arguments evaporate into an amorphous cloud of ill will.""...and the reactionaries of the right still hold fast to their hatred of reality. [Why is this book of lies still in print?]"
1,David Brock Admits to Smearing Anita Hill,"Reader beware: In David Brock's later book, Blinded by the Right, he admits to smearing Anita Hill in this book. ""Doubts about (Anita Hill's) testimony were furthered by the widely publicized and later recanted claims of David Brock, who coined the phrase ""a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty"" to describe Professor Hill. Later, in his book ""Blinded by the Right,"" Brock confessed that, to please his conservative backers, he had deliberately gone after Anita Hill's reputation in a smear campaign that relied on false and unfounded information."" Wikipedia entry on Anita Hill, August 24, 2007"
2,no subtitles,Interesting movie but it would be nice if the segment filmed in Japan had subtitles so the viewer could follow along with the conversations. Interviewing people in Japan and not giving us a translation as to what is being said is useless.
3,Confusing,"I don't have a clue about the history of this album but I'd be interested to find out why 9 of the 10 songs on this CD appear on the earlier release (and current reissue) titled ""A Crystal Christmas"". The only difference in songs is that this album contains ""Christmas In America"" in place of ""Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer"". It is impossible to tell if these are the same tracks or newly recorded as the quality of this CD is not as good as ""A Crystal Christmas"". It could be a poor transfer, remastered or newly recorded I simply was unable to tell. Unless you are specifically interested in the song ""Christmas in America"" then I would recommend that you purchase ""A Crystal Christmas"" (the newer Laserlight issue will be more affordable) instead of ""Crystal Gayle Christmas"". The three star rating is based on the quality of the recording and the fact that the material, with only one exception, can be found on Crystal Gayle's other Christmas album."
1,Contemporary Hodgepodge,"Sad to say, this book represents for me not a collection of beautiful, distinguishable motifs, ideas and projects, but more of the depressing, disheveled, hodgepodge and disorder all too familiar in today's ""art"".Hardly a ""sourcebook of ideas"" and with just one or two mediocre exceptions, the examples in this book were nothing more than uninspiring masses of color and texture that leave one with the question - what does this represent?Many of the projects in this book can best be done by a child on a BAD day, especially the ""technique"" on page 13 under ""painting techniques"", where a swathe of red paint slobbered across fabric several times, is described as ""fabric paint brushed randomly using a large brush"". Pitiful would be a much better description!Do not waste your time or money on this book if you want to be truly inspired!"
5,Practical introduction to Eclipse,"This is a solid introduction to Eclipse from the user level. It guides you through installing Eclipse, starting your first project, and integrating with source control. There is a small section on writing a plugin, but it's not the emphasis of the book.O'Reilly's Eclipse books spent about half their time on Eclipse and the other half on plain Java development which was a waste of space. This book spends on chapter on web development, and some of that chapter is spent on use of Eclipse in that context. It's a diversion in both the Manning and O'Reilly books, but the O'Reilly books are far worse.This is the best introduction to end-user Eclipse that I have read. If you want a book on getting started with Eclipse as a Java development IDE, this is the one."
1,disappointed in cd,It was not clear to me before I purchased this book that the embroidery designs used in this book must be purchased separately -- they were not included on the cd. The book said they were available from Amazing Designs but that does not seem to be the case as they are not available. Very disappointed in this book.
2,Initially enticing but then disappointing,"I was very keen when I began this book. Roche's ideas are intriguing, and the book is nicely laid out with good directions. What I was NOT prepared for, though, was that even though the designs are supposedly from Amazing Designs, they simply are not there. Hence, it is quite difficult to follow Roche's directions. I think this makes the book something of a rip-off, since in the first place, one would assume the CD included the designs in her projects (as does Patty Albin's book and CD) and then when one overcomes this disappointment it becomes apparent that the designs are not even available at the sources she lists. The list price in Canada is $41.99--had I paid that price it would be back at the store, pronto."
1,Stay away!!!,"This is a ripoff and not a book by David Shannon. It is ""Based on the books by David Shannon"". It's 8 pages long and uses illustrations from other ""David"" books with different captions. The back cover says ""A gift from Scholastic Book Clubs. This edition is only available for distribution through the school market."" I'm guessing that it was distributed as a free promo from scholastic to promote reading as well as the ""David"" series. Fine, but don't sell it as a book by David Shannon. I bought it thinking that he had written a new ""David"" book."
1,Too theoretical,"This 200-page volume is better described as an academic monograph that extends the classic mean-variance asset allocation model in a multiple-period setting, hence the marketing claim ""portfolio choice for long-term investors."" The book will be interesting to those studying finance Ph.D. looking for a good survey -- the latter chapters resember papers in academic journals -- but is entirely impractical to the average investor or even, IMHO, most money managers. Much of the stuff cannot even be implemented on your Excel spreadsheet! So what you have is a very boring and inaccessible book that won't teach you a thing about how to practice strategic asset allocation."
3,Better books available,"The pictures are B & W, and aren't even particularly good B & W. David Boye's book is better and more detailed, as are several others. I know Loveless is a legend as a knife maker, but that doesn't have any impact on his written work. OK to buy as a historical document but there are better first books if you want to learn to be a knife maker."
4,Good book w/good info,"Different methods from different makers. A good compilation. I bought mine used, but it would have been worth it, at full/new price. A good book, for the wanna-be knife maker. Add this one to your library."
5,a book once started that's impossible to ignore,I bought this as a present -- for my wife -- but ended up getting another for myself. this is the first journal i've ever been motivated to keep daily -- been doing it now for over five months. the motivation comes from the 365 often very inspiring epigrams & quotes the author presents. there's one on each page that stimulates -- then the author asks for your personal response. the result is a stimulating daily session i'd never have written without the journal's prodding. also unexpected fun has come from comparing my entry with my wife's ... the book is unique and a great idea!
3,Murder at 5:00--film at 11:00,"A well-told crime story involving a gay television reporter, his policeman BF, a Hollywood film legend and a murdered teenager. The present open debates over gay marriage and ""don't ask don't tell"" trending toward a serious liberalization of public policy on these issues makes the closeted environment that characterizes the backdrop for this book seem pretty dated. Nevertheless, ""Innuendo"" moves along at a good clip, includes some authentic sounding descriptions of television news production and ends with a plausible resolution to the murder mystery. A little creaky in 2010, but not a bad read overall."
1,hmmmmmmmmm.......,"I was impressed enough with ""design basics index"" by this author to buy this one. This book however was kind of a joke. Sorry. The ideas in hereare nothing you wouldn't have thought of (unless you never think).It is a small book, so the pages don't have much room on them (for the type size) to write much anyway, even if the ideas were worth having.I was forced to give it one star.....because this review form won't allow me to give it less."
5,A Truly Inspiring Book!!!!!,"I love everything about this book! It got my creative juices flowing again and the idea journal nearly burned up from the writing speed. He is an artist and a writer. I bought 15 copies for gifts!I feel the same about all of his other books too! They are clever, informative, colorful, designed perfectly, inspiring, intelligent, fun, creative, fantastic and fabulous! Truly awesome! READ THEM ALL--NOW!"
2,Not like his other books,"I have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of this title. If your expecting anything like Idea Index or his other titles, don't buy this book. It is very well produced, however, I think it will spend more time on the bookcase than next to my computer."
5,Great Book!,"This is a great book. You can just flip it open to any page and start reading at anytime. You do not have to read it from cover to cover to get anything out of it. It is great for igniting your creativity and getting ideas. I bought it for my husband who is a graphic designer for Christmas, and he loved it too!"
5,Excellent album!,"Although I greatly enjoyed Billie Myers' first album, Growing Pains, I believe that Vertigo is my favorite. Alternating between funky, thought-provoking, upbeat dance songs to low, mournful, passionate ballads... this album is comprised of a roller-coaster's highs and lows. I love it! Many of the songs are sing-able/dance-able. Several made me stop and think about the meaning behind the lyrics. A lot of political and religious opinions are woven into the lyrics of this album. A little bit of sex and a little bit of playful edginess round out the track listing. I greatly enjoyed this CD in every aspect."
1,"DOES NOT ""fit most frames up to 5'10"" tall & up to 175lbs""","I bought another pair of footless tights from Luxury Divas and one of my friends bought these. I'm 148 lbs and 5'7"" and I could NOT get these on past my thighs--and NO--ny thighs aren't fat!My friend bought these and she could not get hers on either -- and she is 5'4"" and 123 lbs. I returned mine (and was charged a 20% restocking fee!!!!) while she made sleeves out of hers on her sewing machine (gives you an idea how thin your legs would have to for these tights to fit properly).Also, the other reviewer is right: because the ""design"" is printed on, it fades considerably once you stretch these tights on.Finally, Luxury Divas charges an exhorbitant shipping & handling charge--close to SEVEN BUCKS--when it actually cost $1.30 to mail the tights!"
3,It's ok...I guess for chillin at home only,"I was lookin for some really good unique music.I at first picked up Om lounge 100 that wasnt it and then i picked up Black Martini just by chance and being adventurous. It was ok , a couple of good tracks but this taught me unless you have heard something you like already lounge is definately not the arena to be adventurously blind in .Overall could be a nice part of the collection"
1,Black Martini,"Ummm...what can I say about this CD. Well, save your money is the only thing I can think of. There was only one song on it that I liked (one that prompted me to buy it in the first place). After that all I can say is yuk!"
1,A Big Disappointment,"After having been told that ""if I liked 'Sympathique' by Pink Martini, I'd like 'Black Martini', I looked forward to hearing this album. Disappointed is an understatement. It is ready for the trash can."
4,An essential book on household repairs,This book is a collection of hard to find information on fixing nearly everything in the home. Always my first choice for a housewarming gift.
5,Had the older version -- loved it,"I bought this title in 1970 when I bought my first home. The night I moved in, we had to call the gas company about a gas smell. They had to turn off (and lock) the hot water heater until the exhaust pipes were fixed. My first homeowner experience, and not my last. I bought this book shortly after, and it saved me a lot of grief with its clear diagrams and explanations. Saved me lots of money too as I was able to fix ""stuff."""
4,Super stories!!,Anyone enjoying the paranormal will enjoy these stories by Maggie Shayne. She makes a world that shines even after dark...
2,Pretty good read...,This book is good but unnecessary for the progression of the series. These characters don't really reoccur in the rest of the series --with the exception of Donovan in the book Edge of Twilight (and that is just a bit part you don't need to read this book to understand it). These stories are good just for the enjoyment of the vampire series but the only story I liked is the first one. I can't ever seem to get through the second.
3,agree with jinxednokla,"can't agree more--I love the series and, for that reason only, will keep this one, but not up to the previous standards. Recommend the other Twilight titles and skip this one."
1,Horrible,"If I could rate this book less than 1 star, I would rate it at a negative triple zero. There are virtually no right answers in this book. Most of my time was spent checking the textbook for the correct answers. Granted, I have spent much time studying my textbook, so imagine my surprise when I saw all the INCORRECT answers printed as RIGHT answers!!!Is this author plotting revenge towards all up and coming cosmotologists for all the studying she had to do for her own exam? (...)Don't waste your money on this book...you would be better off burning your money in the fireplace than to waste your time on this book."
5,Great service. Fast shipping.,"The book arrived after only two days, which was several days before it was estimated to arrive."
1,Plowing Through,"I never made it past the first three chapters (even though we were assigned to read the whole thing). The long, drawn out epistomology and boring examples (sucked the life out of Little Red Ridinghood) was so hard to get through, I probably never made it to the good stuff. Definitely not fun, exciting reading for the average person."
2,Not a knife sharpener,This may be a sharpener but for what I'm not sure. It is rough like a file but not big enough to sharpen an axe in any hurry. It is way too rough for making a sharp edge on a knife
2,Not that useful,"I had hoped to use this book to look up specific perennials and compare their colors, but most of the flowers I had in mind were not included in the book. There are 639 plants covered, not just perennials, but annuals, bulbs, vines, and shrubs as well. So considering that there are thousands of varieties of flowers, the chances of finding a particular flower are slim. This book is better used without a specific plant in mind, but to browse through to get ideas of plants of a particular color.Also, there seems to be a warm climate bias. Many of the plants (not just annuals) are for zones 8 and up. I think northern gardeners would find this a frustrating book to use."
3,very pretty,"This is a very pretty book, but it has one major flaw. The plants are listed by scientific name and rarely by common name. This can be a problem if, for example, you just want to see, for example, a pansy, and you don't know the scientific name and don't feel like looking it up."
1,A note about the e-version,"This is simply a note about the e-version. The text was not thoroughly edited after being scanned from the book. For example, ""came"" is always spelled ""carne,"" and there are many other errors that make it occasionally hard to understand or guess what the correct word should be. It was distracting, and I feel like a full-priced e-book should have been carefully proofread-- or at least spell-checked!The book itself was excellent, though. It made a great read and great discussion for our book club."
3,A thoughtful and reflective insight of homesteading.,"Raban captured my interest in his first paragraphs. His insights and thoughtful musings on homesteading life and the politics and national dynamics at the turn of the century shed new light on a section of the west I had previously thought of merely as desolate.Excellent reading through the first 3/4 of the book. In the last portion, however, Raban lost my interest with his stereotyping of conservatives and categorizing conservatives of all types with right-wing militants. The book was otherwise too well written to deserve this bit of inappropriate commentary. Editing this portion of ill-fitting bias out would have saved the day."
4,"A thought provoking, well written book","I wholeheartedly agree with many of the other reviewers who question Raban's opinions and social commentary. Several times Raban made me want to puke with his stereotypical portrayals of modern day Montanans and his generalizations about their politics (read: ignorance). However, without his commentary, this would have been just another history book full of dates, places and events. It is not. Rather, it is a well written narrative that focuses on individual stories of the homesteaders, and tries to draw some larger conclusions from their experiences. And in the process, Raban injects a great deal of commentary that compels laughter, reflection, and profound disagreement. In other words, it does what a good book should. So, disagree with Raban's opinions, but recognize that he has written a very good book."
3,"Well worth reading, but flawed","This book should be irresistible to anyone who has driven past a teetering wreck of a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere and wondered ""What happened?"" Here is a partial answer, somewhat satisfying. Despite a rambling organization and a not a few pages of tangential musings (that surely would NOT have been missed), it was a nice cross between a thoughtful road-trip essay and a couple of hours with your great-grandfather's diary. In early chapters, the author presents as an impartial observer; unfortunately, by the final chapters, the reader is so conscious of Mr. Raban's political leanings that much of the ""history"" ends up looking like interpretation. Still, taken for what it is - one individual's POV - it can be recommended. It would make a wonderful travel book, and I'm almost sorry I read in my living room instead of on the road."
3,A fine essay but a so-so book,"Raban is a beautiful writer and he has captured the eastern Montana badlands spectacularly but there's not enough here to justify the book; his thesis, to the extent he has one just can't bear the weight and the last 60 pages are just plain irritating. It would have made a better essay and personally, I was disappointed."
2,Not up to usual Raban standards,Let me say first that I love Jonathan Raban's writing. I devoured Hunting Mister Heartbreak. Passage to Juneau was a great companion to my (rather pedestrian) cruise to Alaska. And I am currently in a vicarious voyage down the Great Mississippi via Old Glory. But Bad Land was a disappointment like the promises made by the railroads to those eastern European settlers. It was dry like the farming techniques meant to coax crops out of the half-sections. I just did not enjoy this to the extent that I have with other Raban books.
2,Raban is no Wallace Stegner,"I was disappointed in the author's failure to capture the spirit of the settlers who sacrificed so much in their attempt to settle eastern Montana. He told their stories from a distance, and was quick to place blame. I kept speculating as to how Wallace Stegner might have told these poingnant stories. Stegner's roots and his love of the American west would have made him a much better voice for these 20th century pioneers."
1,Stream of Consciousness!,"My earlier acquaintance with Jonathon Raban's work lead me into this book with the hope that it would offer a well written and compelling discussion of his chosen subject. I'm dissappointed. It is a rambling stream of consciousness, discursive, lacking structure and focus. The reviews inside the front cover, from the Financial Times, Daily Telegraph, Sunday Times Spectator, and Scotland on Sunday - all suffer from the same quality of dubious veracity, that tainted the efforts of the railroad companies and the US Federal Government, to attract settlers to the featureless and infertile plains of Montana.I rate this book a waste of reading time."
4,Montana history comes alive,"Living in Montana & having a mother born in the northeastern part of the state who told us many a story of'baking sun,' blizzards and wolves, I am quite familiar with all the towns & locals mentionedin this book. The author brings Montana history alive, busts some myths about homesteading andintroduces the reader to some real Montana 'characters.' The only inaccuracy is his mention of theAgricultural College in Missoula. This is wrong. The University of Montana is in Missoula and is NOTthe land grant, agriculture college. That is located at MSU in Bozeman, Mt. Makes one wonder abouthis other factual accuracy. All in all, a must read for Montana history lovers."
3,"great book, awful Kindle version","It is shame that this Kindle version has so many typos. For example, ""came"" shows up every time as ""carne"", and there are numerous other typos that make some sentences impossible to figure out. How this could be put on the market and sold for $11.99 is beyond me. I am giving it 3 stars because I do not want to turn people off a good book, but this Kindle version is a disgrace to the book and to the electronic medium and deserves less than 1 star."
5,2004 silverado Throttle body and tps sensor,"A great product for a great price.Direct fit truck runs like new, very easy to install took only 10 minutes."
3,Worth an occasional listen,"I couldn't give these concerti recordings higher than three stars. This music is well crafted and written,but the concertos #2 & #7 pretty much follow the form of the piano concerti of the era. #8 is more interesting.What makes this recording worth listening to is the excellent performances, and the fact that Beethoven held Cramer's piano playing in very high regard. These concertos do reflect a virtuoso technique, and that is also a reason why they deserve an occasional hearing."
2,Lots of Screen Shots and some strategy tips,"This book has good strategy tips that would be a lot more helpful if they were more complete. The maps are very good and list locations of all items, switches and secret areas (which I often walk by), but not monsters. There are lots of good screen shots, but some are dark in the background...better than the average book. Very helpful, but not worth the money."
1,SAD,"We intitially rec'd 4 after out of stock problems. The emblem breaks off after only a few weeks, very poor quality. Wouldn't buy again"
5,Fits Great,Lost my original 135L lens hood after a photo shoot and looked everywhere for a replacement. It was sold out everywhere online except for Amazon. The lens hood fits the lens perfectly and I have no complaints about it.
4,Happy Trance.,"Happy good-o-down-to-earth trance. Warning, it does contain vocals which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Trance should have less vocals and more breakbeats."
2,"Great visual, Text is gibberish","The cover is a great visual representation of progressions and the relationship between chords.However the text is unclear GIBBERISH.There are a few gems of information deeply buried beneath condescending inferences that you should ALREADY KNOW this, TRUST ME on that, or JUST TRY IT and it will work.This book doesn't teach theory, it CONFUSES an average studentIt would be better to have just the cover and a one page explanation of its usage on the back-that would be worth $5, but at this cost it is not worth it!"
5,Music Therory's Class' Best Friend,"I love this tool. I bought it to help me out with my music theory homework. This tool helps save so much time. I can now do transposition homework assignments in 1/2 the time it used to take me. This tool is to music what a calculator is to math. My only regret is that I do not have this tool for the minor keys, and if it does exsist, i cannot find it. The music theory guide inside is basic, but very easy to understand. The text is well written and easy to read in a short period of time. I HIGHLY recomend this book."
3,"Great Concept, But.....","Basically a circle of fifths on steroids. I think the concept is great as far as a visual learning tool in exploring chord progressions, and chord relationships. For most of the rest of the ""Features"" this does, I think there are much easier ways of doing these things. For example: you can do chord construction with it but it is rather complex, slow, and clunky ( a simple step chart is much easier). Also as noted in other reviews the documentation is sparse, lacking, and suspect. I think that most of the 3 star and below reviewers will do a better job of explaining than I can, just be aware that it may not be exactly what it says it is.UPDATE!!!I just received aThe Guitar Wheeland I think it is much better for advanced use though I think this wheel might be better for beginners."
5,Big Rave!!!,"Darn good, easily understood manual that doesn't require two years of music theory to deal with. First rate!"
4,Great invention,"I started just using it, and I think I will use it all the time, when I start writing music. Great invention!!!"
2,Very basic,"Too much money for so few pages. I thought I would improve my knowledge of chord progressions/modulations but it was nothing new to me. If you are a beginner, maybe go for it otherwise save your money for a better book."
3,I was expecting more,"After reading a lot of reviews I have to say I was expecting much more.That said, this is fine. Truth said, there's just not much there."
4,Useful tool,"Though this is not perfect, it is useful. Yes, if you know theory well enough, you can figure most of this out in your head. However, if your a novice or just need a reminder, this is great. No, it doesn't completely describe theory or cover every possible option but I don't think it was intended to. The instructions inside are brief but there is a website to back it up. I find this thing very useful."
4,musical tool,I found this helpful. I'm not a music major just a guitar player wanting a little help.
4,Circle of Fifths on cover,"Interactive circle of fifths on cover, it works well, actually have not even read the book, buy it anyways, things could be a lot worse."
3,Chord Wheel,It's okay and funny. Well done. It is easy to read. Colors make easy everything about the finding notes and chords.
5,Wheels within Wheels,Lots to discover with this handy guide. I didn't know how much I didn't know about music theory! Enlightening and fun!
3,Not for beginners,"I agree that the concept of the chord wheel is a good one, but the information in the book is too advanced for a beginner. If you don't know much about musical construction and function, it is difficult to determine what the author might be telling you."
2,Not suitable for Kindle,"This book is best purchased in hard copy since it contains an actual physical wheel that is used throughout the book. Without being able to turn the wheel and follow along with the text, the exercises become nearly useless. This is one case where is doesn't make sense to buy the electronic version."
5,A wonderful music theory tool,"I have played guitar for over 10 years. I am a guitar instructor as well. Sometimes it's difficult to keep all the chord theory in my head at all times. This little tool, the Chord Wheel, is an excellent aid that I find myself using often.The Chord Wheel has a spinnable template that lays over the circle of fifths. Instantly, it helps you understand the flats and sharps in each key. Once you spin it to a certain key, it gives you all the main chord substitutions for every step in the gey--genious. The Chord Wheel also has some excellent chord theory instruction within its few pages.I use The Chord Wheel as part of my teaching curriculum. I haven't found a better tool to teach the circle of fifths or to introduce my students to the power of basic chord substitutions.Excellent product, Jim. Thanks.Hope this helps.-Craig Nybo, co-author of [ ... ]"
4,The Chord Wheel,"The book is very short with 12 pages. The book gives a very basic view on the relation of chords and chord functions. It has some other stuff, like chord construction, scales, and transposition. The best thing about the book is the chord wheel on the cover. It has a moveable plastic to set to a key and it will tell you what relation the chords are in the key. Don't buy the book if you are looking of in depth music theory, buy it for the interactive chord wheel diagram on the cover."
5,Amazing Tool,This is an essential tool for music composition and a great refresher if you are starting to compose again or have mostly played by ear like i have. Definitely a must have...
5,Very helpful tool,"This chord tool is as simple as turning the wheel to know which chords can be used. It is very simple, but within the book you can understand more about why certain chords ""fit,"" as well as the relationship between the other chords within a key."
2,The Chord Wheel,I bought chord wheel a couple years ago and could not figure the thing out to little explanation and I play piano hoping to help me play by ear better. No luck it sits in the bottom of all my music. I am trying one of the other music books right now.
1,Use your money elsewhere,"The front cover is a tricky arrangement and that's all. No one can learn whatever may be from this book, except that the inner part of the absolute void is the absolute useless. The worst book in music I've ever seen."
3,theif?!!,"Mr. Schulz, you invented nothing. This wheel was originally published at least 60 years ago, and probably invented well before that. In music, we all stand on the shoulders of our forebears."
3,Not bad but not enough,This was a pretty interesting read for the most part I liked it but it wasn't enough. What has worked for me over the last 3 months has been a 2 volume video training course I got here[...]They go over everything step by step and change a cheap priceI'd get both the book and their video training course can't go wrong with both
3,pretty good,colorful and attractivenot as easy to understand when first looking at it from a newbies point of view.-very helpful for those with musical knowledge for a quick reference
5,This a great product for either beginning or accomplished guitar players,"As a guitar player and teacher I have used this wheel for many years, but I never found one that was like a slide rule where you just turn it to the Key(chord) and all the other associated chords were shown including minors, 7th's, 9th's and all sharp's flats etc. associated with the key that you want to play in...I bought one for a student that I am teaching ""left handed guitar"" and liked so well I just ordered another for myself..Great product."
2,works but not well,"If you iron, you know you need someplace to hang the clothes you have ironed prior to putting them awaythis over the door hanger works with the weight of the clothes to keep it in positionits rather wobbly, and falls on occassion, but better then nothingIt good as it is very portable, so you can iron anywhere , just be careful you don't run into it and smack your head!"
4,Good reference book for Word 2002,"I found this book to be technically capable, and very easy to read or look up Word questions that I have."
5,Microsoft Word Version 2002,This is a helpful book for those learning the finer points of word processing. The book if filled with good information on all aspect of word. I would recommend this book.
4,Good for a computer illiterate,"I recently began to use this book as a reference to help me understand the many things Word offers, and how to set up to use them. It is quite easy to understand and follow, with clearly drawn illustrations, step by step directions in language that even a computer novice like me can make sense of. I have other books about Microsoft Word, but this one has been the most helpful to this confused beginner."
3,Seems ok,"Unlike Microsoft Press Vista Course reviewed earlier, the DVD worked ok. The course seems to be working fine and material is ok.Word of Warning. Change Vista Setting to run in ""XP"" option or you will get a regular Blue Screen and lost your study material."
2,Step by Step Microsoft Word 2002,The book is exactly as advertised. It is great way to improve computer skills at your own pace.
3,Good for the average Joe,I bought this series of books for the people at the office. They are easy to understand and pretty much anyone learnt something new. This book is not for computer geeks.. Too basic for you...

5,Ford Factory Style Trim-to-fit Front Mats,"The Ford Factory Style Front Floor Mats Look Great in my 2011 F-150 Lariat SuperCrew. They Fit Perfectly! Nice Product, and a much better price than you get at the dealership."
4,Backcountry Lazyboy,"This is a wonderfully comfortable, 14oz. camp chair that will make you feel like a king or queen sitting on a throne. This chair comes in 20"" and 25"" widths, and both chair kits can be used with a 60"", 66"", 72"" or 78"" long pad and mummy or rectangular shaped sleeping pads. I use this with a 2.5"" thick Big Agnes insulated Air Core pad, and it is thick and cushy like no other camp chair out there. If this chair is too heavy for your liking, well, BA makes the Cyclone SL that weights in a only 6 oz. Big Agnes products will not let you down.Big Agnes Big Easy Chair Kit"
5,The next big writer,This is one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Quigley does a great job of painting a vivid picture through his language that you feel like you are right there. I recomend it to golf lovers every where.
3,God's Amazing Creatures,"I was very disappointed with the age expectation. The pictures, insights, and format is, at the earliest, only appropriate for age 8-11, so I'll have to save it, and have not found any other for 6yr. olds."
2,"Hmmmmm, not too happy",This battery was received on time and in a good condition but it did not fit my phone properly nor did it or is it keeping charge. On a full charge I probably get 30 minutes cell phone use. I am therefore not too pleased about this.
5,About the Product: Slipcase Set 1 (Books #1-4),"Combine the Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew with Indian Jones, make them Christians in search of Biblical artifacts, and you'll get the gist of these novels. They are nothing more or less than what they claim to be: enteraining reads for young readers, intertwining spiritual lessons with fast-paced action. Adults may be bored by the simplicity or stretched realism of these stories, but pre-teen and early teens will enjoy these works as much as older readers enjoy Peretti's The Oath or This Present Darkness.This edition matches the ISBN and photo for CBD's slipcase set, which features books #1-4 in the set of 8: Door in the Dragon's Throat, Escape From the Island of Aquarius, The Tombs of Anak, and Trapped At The Bottom Of The Sea. This set includes the collector's box and four (newer release/cover design) paperbacks. As far as I know, books #5-8 are unavailable in a boxed set (the newer paperbacks), but they are available separately."
5,LOVE these books!!,"I remember reading these books (1-4) when I was a pre-teen and now I am going to be buying them for my 11 year old son! These are wonderful books for children that give great examples of the christian faith in a ""real world"" situation. I can't wait to get these and the next two in so that I can get my son hooked on them as well!"
1,Way too big,I have a a chihuahua mix. This was WAY too big. Won't be ordering from this company again. Luckily my neighbor has a boxer and he loves it.
1,Sticky Paint with Strong Odor,I purchased these baskets to use in my new baby's nursery. When I opened the box I instantly smelled a strong chemical paint odor. Not what you would want in a no VOC nursery. As I touched the baskets the paint was tacky like it wasn't dry or melted in transit. I was horrified with the product. I was very pleased with Amazons return policy & that UPS picked them up at our door. Kuddos for Amazon but think twice before ordering these baskets.
2,"cheaply made, inaccurately sized","Firstly, these baskets are advertised as being 19"" long, 17"" long and 15"" long, It even has these lengths on the box it ships in! Their ACTUAL lengths are 17.5"", 15.5"" and 13.5"" long - each basket is off by 1.5 INCHES! (the length and width are accurate). Even if the dimensions were accurate though, these baskets are cheaply made, and feel like they are abut to crumble. They smelled like spray paint com in out of the box and the blue paint looked hastily and sloppily applied. I would maybe pay $10 total for all three, but at $10 per basket, the quality is lacking."
1,"Poor quality, scratches up diaper changing table","Awful, much flimsier than other wicker baskets I have seen and the wicker is broken in so many places, it has badly scratched the paint in multiple places on my diaper changing table. After buying these I have seen so many options for baskets that both looked better and were of better quality!"
3,"Cute, but NOT WHITE!","These baskets are the perfect sizes to use in my child's nursery. They arrived intact and seem to be nice and sturdy.Unfortunately, they aren't white -- they are more of an ""antique white."" I had to paint them white in order for them to match the rest of the nursery."
2,Cheap. Quality and color poor,The basets arrived today and I was so disappointed in their quality. The color of the baskets is not a true white; they have a bamboo color (yellow tone). I should have read the review (negative one) since I have the same thoughts. Don't waste your money on these cheap baskets!!!!
2,Poor quality,"Although some reviews, I was expecting a better quality. But it is not worth the price. It is not clean and it is too heavy."
3,The liner is WHITE and it's shows PINK and says PINK online,The baskets themselves are sturdy. The liner material is just okay. My biggest gripe is that they say online that the liner is pink and the basket is white. Neither is true. The line is white and the basket is some color between white and pink ... I really can't explain it. I'm going to keep them (for now) until the changing table arrives to see how they look / fit.
1,horrible product,"I ordered these baskets for my nursery and was very disappointed with the quality. as soon as I opened the parcel I felt a very specific chemical smell. and on top of that it looks like the baskets are made of some dried up wood, that cracks in the middle and just falling apart, leaving very tiny, sharp pieces of wood that I definitely don't want to introduce to my child. And I hate returning the things, so first I wanted to use them for a storage, but after just 2 days of sitting in my storage they made the whole room smell. It's a really horrible product and there is no way I keep it in my home and I definitely don't recommend it to anybody."
2,Not a match,"The baskets themselves are not the best quality,by far. I ordered 2 sets to go om the shelves of a changing table my husband had built for our granddaughter. One set was very white, which is what I wanted. The second set was very cream colored. :( I'd read the reviews after I'd ordered them and could only hope for the best. When I opened the boxes I realized right away the sets don't match. Very disappointed."
2,Baskets Are Not White,"I got the baskets to match with the dresser I bought for the nursery. The baskets are not white at all. They are more of a cream color so they don't match well with the dresser. I have found other uses for them around the house. Plus, the baskets are all different sizes."
4,Cute baskets,I ordered these baskets based on the price. I couldn't find anything similar at any local stores. The baskets themselves are pretty decent although bigger than I had originally thought. I wanted to put them on some shelves that are attached to my baby's crib but the largest one is a little too big to fit. I'm keeping them anyway and using the largest one to store baby blankets in. They look really cute in the nursery.
5,nice!,Bought these baskets for a baby shower gift and they were very cute for a nursery. Would buy them again.
4,"With Some Cleaning, the Baskets are Great!","I bought these adorable looking baskets for my baby's nursery with a little hesitation after having read a couple of reviews describing the baskets as musty and moldy. When mine arrived, they were not moldy at all, however they definitely had a musty smell. I cleaned them with gentle soap and water and aired out the baskets for a week or so. The smell is now gone and they look great. I'm glad I bought them."
4,Good baskets for nursery,"Overall, I am very pleased with these baskets. The basket is white and the liner is more cream. The sizes are great. Now let's see how long they last before breaking. My 2yr old has already sat in the biggest one and it held her (28lbs)."
4,"Lovely, but not very strong",These baskets are beautiful. Be careful when handling or loading to heavy. The cane cracks off when handling. The sizes are great and allow for a lot of flexibilty.
2,Cheap baskets,"I was extremely dissapointed with these baskets. The basket is very cheap looking and one of the baskets in my set was unevenly woven. The lining is very thin and cheap. All of the liners had loose thread, and one liner was dirty with brown stains. I am definately going to try and return."
2,A little boring,I was facinated by the topic and cast. I really like J.Smith and S.Wiinters. This movie was middle-of-the-road at best.
2,VERY DATED,Was really looking forward to this. But lord has time changed so much? The plot devices were so corny it was almost unbelievable. I'm sorry to say but Shelly Winters was the only redeeming factor in this otherwise ridiculous drama.
1,Disappointed,"I am sorry I wasted my money on this film. I bought it because I like Jaclyn Smith, but it was not a film I would have expected her to make. It was a strange film and,I felt, rather crude."
2,Maybe try something else. . .,"I have this one, and have read the reviews of the similar models, where people state they have all sorts of problems. My went back twice after repeated failures and reloading of the operating stytem until, both times, the thing couldn't even make it through the bios routine and had to go in for service. The second time, after I became Their Worst Nightmare, the motherboard was replaced. Now I think it's fine, but I wouldn't buy it or a similar Compaq again.Even this one was an overheater, until yesterday, when I checked the CPU usage stats (control-alt-del, then the process tab) and discovered that the program for Net Waiting--moh.exe--takes up ALL the unused processor time ALL the time. As soon as I shut it down the fan went off. Now when it does come on, it's only half-speed and no longer blows my coffee cup off the table. So much for Net Waiting!"
2,Bad Power Supply,"I loved this laptop when I first got it a little over 1 year ago. For the Price, it seemed unbeatable! However, I had to send it back to Compaq to fix the power supply, as it wasn't getting power. I'm not exactly sure what they did to fix it, however, it worked for about 3 months, and now, it has the same symptoms. I am one who has a desktop backup computer, however, I still miss my laptop. I used to have an old P166 Compaq desktop that is still kicking, however, I would not buy this laptop again. Good Luck!"
5,AM I THE ONLY PERSON WHO THINKS THAT TAL'S HOTTER?,"Alright, I'll admit it, I love Gil's too-blue almond eyes (like mine,exceptmy eyes are green) But for some reason, I think Tal's hotter. Though he's in the band, he barely gets any media attention whatsoever. Please e-mail me if you feel the same way."
5,Definitely one that will NOT leave your cd player -- EVER!,"Gil's cd is AWESOME!! His songs are lively, and make you want to get up and start DANCING! Woo-hoo!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,The product was defective (cracked) and almost burned my car's lighter.Now I understand the $0.01 price + $4.99 shipping expense.Isn't this seller making their money from the shipping expenses!!!DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. AMAZON SHOULD BAN THIS SELLER FROM ITS WEBPAGE!
1,Did not last one week,"It did work for 3 days.Day 4 the fuse of my car went off.I changed the fuse and re-connected the charger and it blew the fuse off.I know for a fact that is the charger, because I do connect a GPs and I do not have this problem."
1,Not good for my Palm Treo 700wx,I bought this for my brand new Palm Treo 700WX. It gets heated up quickly & the mobile automatically disconnects it complaining about the heat this charger generates.I couldn't use it. Donno if its due to the incompatibility with 700wx or just the piece that i bought.
1,You can get the same ideas on google,"I sent this book back because when I google paper bag projects, I receive tutorials for simpler, more eye popping designs than offered in this book, especially for kids from kindergarten to 2 nd grade. Don't waste your money."
2,I was expecting too much.,"I was a little disappointed in this book. I was hoping for a craft book that my talented 6-year-old son could do himself. He often asks to do crafts, and then I need to find a craft and find all the supplies for the crafts and then set up and clean up. I was hoping for a book where I could hand him the book and the paper bags and he could go at it. The crafts are more complicated than that. He still needs help. He needs more supplies than just paper bags and there is still the set-up and clean-up. I almost returned it but I didn't have any other gift for him on Epiphany, so I gave it to him anyway. He has done one puppet in this past month full of snow-days."
4,Great for small jobs.,"They don't open very wide, as discribed, but they are easy to use and hold well. I haven't had them long, so I don't know how well they hold up. They seem to be made fairly well and I think they are going to be a good buy for the price. I use them mostly for art and sewing projects, or to hold small items in place when I need a third arm. If this is what you are looking for, they work well and are worth the price."
2,"Save Your Money, Folks!","This book teaches ventriloquism about as well as a three-page pamphlet teaches nuclear physics. Sure, you will learn a trick or two, but I'd hate to perform with only this knowledge under my belt!And why, WHY do some authors insist on injecting their personal religious beliefs into what are supposed to be secular works? Evangelize in a book written to that purpose, please! About 2000 years ago someone said something about praying quietly and privately in one's own room . . .If you want to be a ventriloquist, there are plenty of sources far superior to this pap. Look for them."
1,Title is Misleading,"The title of this book, survivors of suicide, is extremely misleading. Having recently lost a sister to suicide, I bought this book to try to find some answers and/or support. Instead, reading this book made me feel more guilty and horrible then ever. A couple chapters are devoted to stories and stuff about survivors, but the majority of the book is about who is prone to suicide, how to prevent it, myths (i.e. don't ignore suicide threats)...I finished the book feeling that I was at fault for my sister's suicide. I would recommend that NO suicide survivors read this book."
2,Shaft is too short,"I have a no name mortise machine. Bought this set for use in home shop. The shaft that goes into the chuck is too short on my machine. Make sure you can use these before you purchase them. I tried to use in a drill press as a make shift setup. I damaged the 3/8"" bit and now can't use any of them or return them."
5,Superb essays on gay writers' sense of where they are from,"The late John Preston's collections of essays by American gay male writers about where they live now or lived when they were growing up is always interesting and often insightful. Among other things, it shows that the elite (creationist) discourse about social construction remains very far from the lived experience of even articulate and reflective natives. Michael Nava's memoir of Sacramento and Jesse Monteagudo's of Miami struck me tas the most poignant and insightful. The absence of any Asian-Americans was noticeable. It would be interesting to know if American lesbian writers have similar senses of place and to link these splendid accounts to theories of cognition of place, but these are both other projects."
2,Constructed poorly - broken - company won't fix,"The Elliptical trainer is fun, like all the other trainers are out there. Except this one was constructed very poorly. They missed one of the weld seems by 1/2 inch and won't replace the part. They also wouldn't respond to my inquiries until I contacted the Better Business Bureau. For your own safety don't by this."
5,So Far a FIVE,"I just received this product in the mail, after some research and deciding to purchase fitness quest. I wanted something sturdy, compact, and quiet. For only 84 lbs its quite sturdy! I'm surprised. It works best on hard flooring but very doable on carpet too. if you're super tall, I don't recommend you get this as its stride is 15"". It works for me as I'm 5'4"". The assembly was very clear, and came with extra lubricant for the joints. Super quiet! Reading reviews, I found that experts recommend rear motiion vs. frontal. Much more natural. I'll post an update if anything changes, but so far I'm very pleased, and again, pleasantly surprised."
4,best book for looking for that great aviation site,"This books cuts to the quick. This books lists all the good aviation sites. A little dated and its been out for a couple of years, but still a great quick reference."
1,Outdated; Not worth buying now.,"DO NOT buy this book. This book would have been a great resource in it's day. The information would have been fantastic to have in one place with continuous updates. However, the vast majority of the information in this book is no longer valid now and completely unusable and the updates ended many years ago. Even the update site is no longer up and running. Save your money and just use your search engine on the internet."
1,Do not buy this book. It is woefully outdated.,"When this book was published in 2001 I'm sure it was a great source of information. Now it's a great source of frustration. The vast majority of the sites listed are no longer active. Do not believe the ""updated online"" tease in the upper right corner. The website for the book no longer exists! This book should go out of print and never return."
2,Aviation Internet Directory--,"Overall the books provides usefull Aviation sites on the web. However, many of the best sites in Aviation are not published in this book. I would wish I saved the money I spent."
4,A little high.,"I sag a bit below the waist as its more comfortable for me. If some old guy had his pants up to his belly button he'd be drawin from his armpits! Wish it was two inches or so lower. Otherwise, awesome quality."
4,Pure Disco,Tracklisting:1 Overture (5:33)2 Yankee Doodle Dandy (2:30)3 Hungry For Love (2:57)4 Sun In Your Smile (2:20)5 It All Comes Back To You (3:25)6 Shut Out / Heaven Is A Disco (6:32)Vocals - Donna Summer7 Dance (3:46)8 Last Dance (3:10)9 Trapped In A Stairway (1:52)10 Disco Queen (1:54)11 Pleasure Island (4:47)12 Beautiful Dreamer (4:34)13 Disco Wedding / Honeymoon (In Puerto Rico) / Disco Divorce (9:29)14 Something's Missing (5:40)Vocals - Donna Summer15 Foggy Day / Never Lose Your Sense Of Humor (7:21)Vocals - Donna Summer16 One Man / Finale (4:40)Vocals - Donna Summer
4,A little rough around the edges,Love the design and feel of the ring. Originally ordered the wrong size but customer service was great handling the return. The only downside is the edges of the ring are rough.
5,100 PERCENT ACCURATE,"I HAVE READ MANY BOOKS ON THE PAHLAVI DYNASTY. THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW THAT IS EXTREMELY ACCURATE. IT IS VERY INSIGHTFUL, AND HAS SO MUCH INFORMATION. A MUST READ, BUT HARD TO FIND BOOK."
5,Tons of fun,"I bought this seat to go on a beach cruiser bike and absolutely love it. I have a normal 26"" Electra Beach Cruiser and it fit perfectly with no modifications. My husband installed it in about 5 minutes. I am 5'2"" and have no trouble riding with my daugher in the seat, I don't even have to pedal differently. It is important to note that there are only 2 parts to this system, the plastic seat and the metal bar. The plastic seat can easily come off of the metal bar, so if I want to go for a solo bike ride I just take off the seat, without having to remove the whole system.Once I received this product, I understood the name because my daughter babbles ""weeeeee"" the whole time. It is tons of fun!!"
3,Too small! Chubby babies beware!,"Just bought this item for my (15mo old) son and on the box it says from 1-4yrs old up to 40lbs but the seat is tiny! Very narrow, My 1yr olds fat baby thighs spill slightly over the edges which causes some discomfort on long rides, aside from the size its a great item. Easy to install and super fun for baby just wish it came a lil bigger."
4,A bit small but awesome,This seat is a bit small but I love it. I feel so safe with my daughter in the safety of my arms.
3,Ehhh...It's ok,"I love the concept. Keep the childs weight between you and the handle bar, not behind you. My daughter LOVES it. I am not impressed. I have to peddle bow legged, I do have pretty long legs, but I didn't think it would matter. I can never get the straps tightened. I resorted to putting her in and using diaper pins to tighten it down. It was a pain in the butt to get it installed on my Trek, could have been because of the ""help"" from my 1 year old.That being said, the seat fits the budget. She loves it and that was my goal."
3,For the advanced hobbyist,"This book is not intended for the beginner, nor should it be. Dr. Axelrod has studied this fish (and others) for years. He is a little vague about ""getting started"" because he spends more time describing distinctions amoung discus and the different diseases amoung them."
2,not that great a book,This book does not say much about the steps to take before keeping discuses (e.g.how to set up the tank properly before putting them in etc). This is definately not a book for beginners.
5,"true ""beat"" romance novel","The length (short) of this novel causes it to be very efficient and effective. This story puts the MILLIONS of ""Romance junk novels"" to shame. Without taking off her bra or underwear, or his, Jack Kerouac paints the most beautiful-beatific emotionally wide-ranging ""romance"" / ""life"" story imaginable. Absolute mind-candy, the other reviews are right, makes you want to go to Mexico and have a good time-- even moreso if you are a poet or writer yourself."
5,sweetness,"I can`t really review the whole book yet as I`m only on page 16, but so far this book is thick, and dripping in poetry. Kerouac is genius, unmistakable. I should have read this sooner--by page 16 it`s already more highly beautiful then 1000 other books combined. I`ll read the rest of it and write more later--Hopefully it`s more of the same"
4,A story of love and suffering,"Jack Kerouac's ""Tristessa"" is a short novel about an American poet (named, like the author, Jack) and his love for Tristessa, a Mexico City drug addict. The book follows the experiences of Jack, Tristessa, and their circle of friends in the seedy underside of Mexico City.Kerouac's language in this book is startling: a prose poetry that reminds me of Allen Ginsberg's poem ""Howl."" The words in ""Tristessa"" tumble at you in a wild, hypnotic rush. There are lots of apparently made-up words, sort of ""Spanglish"" flourishes, and pop culture references. Buddhism serves as a frequent subtext to the novel; I would recommend reading this together with Kerouac's ""The Scripture of the Golden Eternity.""""Tristessa"" is a sad look at the human toll taken by drug abuse, and is full of vivid details of the title character's world. Recommended as a companion text: ""Quiet Days in Clichy,"" by Henry Miller."
5,WOW Super price!,"This is very good laptop for the price!I use it for Internet and DVD movies.Battery life over 2 hours not bad!This is the best price I have seen, well worth the money, no stability or tempeture isseus!Best Buy!"
4,Great mobile power for the average user,"The Presario 730US is an excellent option for anyone who wants a balance between mobile power and price. The hard drive and memory are more than adequate for anything the notebook is capable of running; any media players (Winamp and WinDVD in particular) work smooth as silk, as well as Internet Explorer, Office, and a variety of other XP apps. While it won't be running today's hottest games with any reasonable speed due to the S3 Twister drawing from system memory (in actuality the system itself only has 240 MB of RAM available), it has no problems running fun games that are a year old or more. All in all,..., this is an excellent buy for studying or work on the fly."
3,Coaster Country Style Table & Chair Set,"This is a good set for a small nook or breakfast area in the kitchen. But if you are going to buy it, order it with the bench seats, not the chairs. The table and benches are well made and solid. The chairs are weak and skimpy. Daily use with the chairs leaves them wobbly and creaking. I have to constantly tighten the legs and still, they get loose again. If you can live without the chairs, I would recommend the benches and just 2 chairs for the ends of the table."
3,McFarlane's Army - Desert Grenadier,"Another figure I purchased for art/comic work referrence. Highly realistic details, uniform, body armor/grenade bearing vest, helmet, goggles, etc.My only gripe with the figure was that I thought it was an ACTION figure, prior to purchasing and it turns out there are very few (if any) moving parts. Despite, it is still a REALLY nice figure.A nice feature is that the weapon is a separate item from the figure, and is interchangeable with other figures' weapons."
1,"Horrible, and not in a good way","Not much to say here except this has to be one of the worst movies ever made. There is no talent present in front of or behind the camera. The only joy is a little schadenfreude watching Adam West sink to a career low as the police captain. At least I hope he hasn't sunk any lower than this. The story, if it matters, a young man is run over and killed by a group of rowdy teenagers. The mother does what any of us would and takes the body to the local voodoo priestess (every small town has one). The boy is reanimated as a zombie and is directed by the priestess to take revenge on his killers one by one. Add in a soundtrack of 80s hair metal songs and you have yourself a movie. Such as it is. Some of the worst dialog you will ever hear spoken by some of the worst actors you will ever see playing out one of the dullest, most cliche-ridden stories you will ever be subjected to."
5,Dean-o!!!,"I bought another one of these videos and I would love to complete the set! The VHS quality is excellent, best I've seen yet!"
3,Almost worth it just for Don Rickles,"Not as bad as the first DVD I saw in this series. A lot of entertaining stuff in this volume, including a dance with Florence Henderson and a great bit with Peter Sellers. However, there is still some commentary which distracts more than enhances the entertainment value. On a positive note, Don Rickles heckling celebrities from the the stage is... well you have to see it to believe it."
5,Funny,"I have not had the chance to view this dvd yet, it is for a Christmas gift, however, I am looking forward to seeing it. The seller was very prompt and it arrived in good condition"
5,Movie Review - For the Boys,This was a wonderful movie. Bette Midler was amazing! I received this from the shipper in less than a week and it was perfect. I will use this shipper again and recommend them highly.
3,Not good for teenagers...,"It is an excellent story that takes place during the 40's, but it could have deleted the ""trashy languange"" used by Bette Midler. The songs were excellent, but the dialogue in the movie was not sutable for a 60 year old."
1,For the boys,I'm not happy at all I was sent the wrong region. Hello I'm in the USA . This isn't rocket science people. Second time this has happened to me
4,FOR THE BOYS,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE, AND WILL WATCH IT AGAIN AND I HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT, ALSO."
2,Not That Good,"First of all I am not 12, I'm 14. I just don't go away just because I'm an unexpiranced viewer of good movies. I saw this on tv and was expecting a moving movie musical from Bette Midler (Beaches/Gypsy) but was soon very dissipointed.It follows the story of two preformers that preform together for over fifty years. It trys to be good but it just dosn't move me at all. It achuly gets boring! Try to avoid it."
5,Chick Flick,I really enjoy this movie. It's great for an afternoon when you in a mood to watch a teary chick flick. Moms watch out!!!
4,Like you were there!,"Fantastic movie. Having grown up during the post WWII era, the music was fantastic. Also being familiar with the early TV shows the glance to the past was great. Both leading actors made the movie....I was surprised the show wasn't more popular."
5,She's so diverse!,The mark of a versatile artist. The outstanding dramatic performance she gives asDixie Leonard should have gotten her the Oscar. I love this movie and adore Miss M!
2,Lepard Print Bedding in a Bag not that glam.,"It came with all its pieces and all in tact. However, the quality is not up to our standards. Its a little hotel-ish, rather than for a luxurious home bedroom. The textiles are moderate. Definitely and obviously not even close to high end. My husband wanted to return it but since its such a large item to return by mail we are living with it for now. Karima Mohamed, Expert Shopper, Fort Kent Maine."
3,"Good, but not the best of its type","This novel follows a traditional theme. A poor, but ambitious young man (who is of course honest and good) pulls himself up by his bootstaps, etc... It is a good formula, which is why I read these types of books so often. this isn't the best of them, though. It is the first Taylor Caldwell book I have read, and from what others had told me, I was expecting better. The characters are very one dimensional and predicitable (with the possible exceptions of Joan and Lionel). The children are completely unbelievable (if they had only been presented as older, then maybe...). The book isn't bad, but really Kane and Abel by Jeffrey Archer, anything by John Jakes and East of Eden by John Steinbeck are better."
2,Cheap,"This is a cheap item, and you get what you pay for. Adjusting the magnification and focus is more cumbersome than on modern lenses, and what you get is dark and grainy. Forget about using this without a tripod and remote trigger. Even with the tripod, I get better pictures using a reasonably priced lens with half the magnification."
5,Opteka 420mm - 800mm,"For the money, the zoom isvery nice, all operations of the lens are manual, no instructions come with it but the functionality is pretty straight forward. The adapter ring fits perfect to my Rebel XT. With there being a hard set F# you have to adjust things with the frame speed and other setting. Also the pictures brightness is slightly darker than what the LCD on the camera displays for some reasonCapabilities of this lens include great shots of the moon, and up to 4 of the visible moons surrounding Jupiter. Saturn is not out yet but I will get the rings too i suspectOverall if you dont mind the manual aspects, it is a great buy for the price"
4,2 different movies,"It was common practice during the early days of sound films to makedifferent versions in other languages and aimed at the cultural tastesof their audiences. Some actors were bilingual while others spoke theirlines phonetically, sometimes with harsh accents. I was surprised tonotice the differences in these two versions concerning the plotchanges. The English one has some new scenes (The introductory one withmore actors)including the ending where we see the ghosts of the fallenexpedition members as a tribute to their memory. This version seemsmore geared to American audiences who prefer sentiment as opposed tothe longer, harsher Teutonic version where the dog gets less screen timeand disappears. Leni hardly speaks in both films and in the Englishversion her voice seems dubbed by someone else as well as as her Germancounterparts. Regardless, watching both versions is a worthwhileexperience. Stunning location scenery is cleverly edited with set workto create coherent exciting scenes."
4,S.O.S Iceberg,"Old B/W German film, 1933, English and German! Scenes reflect state of the art of that time and are in typical stacato style, very loosly connected episodes. Good acting and unusual scenes of eskimos and them also demonstrating kayak-paddling proficiency. - Famous actress Leni Riefenstahl when young! - Interested in her career I also ordered and watched the movie ""The White Hell Pitz Palu"", including her final interview 2002, in German!- Interesting seeing a different perspective!"
4,Great Content: Horrible Printing,"I took Dr. Doerner's Law Enforcement Class with this text. The Content is great with enough examples to make anyone understand the concepts. The only problem with it, and why it recieved 4-stars, is that the printing in, at least my copy and others I have seen, is horrible. Letters overlap, unexplained spaces, and just random little errors located very commonly throughout the text. While it does not destroy the book, it does disrupt the reading and therefore subtracts from the otherwise 5-star rating."
4,"Timeless Logic Puzzles! (""It's only a step from genius to insanity!"")","I happened upon this when I was seven in a pile of books in the basement of the duplex we moved to. The format is to present a logic puzzle, with the time to solve it (to be a ""genius"") -- and it would give the time a radio or newspaper or other personality of the age had taken as well. (Usually not geniuses. :-))The problems I remember and enjoyed the most were where they'd give you a seemingly insufficient series of random-looking bits of information about some table of information, and through deduction you can complete the missing data. Things like ""The captain of the orange team has tea with the owner of Tulane on Thursday.""This book probably shaped my life even to this day."
3,BASICS,"This is essential to those who are starting to the world of martial arts. I remember of having one, although it doesn't give a vital knowledge, it's gonna push you to the point where you will know and start to love the essence of martial arts, and believe me, the first thing I've learned, I'm still using it!"
4,Very pleased,These are great pry bars. I use them everyday on changing teeth on CAT loaders. I will buy them again.
4,best bang for your buck,"Definitely one of the best bangs for your buck out there. From the ammount of times ive used it, i would say these are durable. The one thing i don't like about the 2 bigger pry bars is that they are a little too thin. The thickness of the actual bar could bigger. Other than that they get the job done and do it pretty well."
5,simpley the best,"the very very best , review from a kiwi way down here , he's cool and very easy to learn from ;)"
2,Product not complete,"I puchased this for my home video system. After receiving this amplifier, I found it does not come with a built-in 12v DC power supply. If you are purchasing this for home use, you will need to also purchase a power supply to convert from 110-120 AC to 12v DC. This increases the cost significantly."
1,ED's people slipped on this one,"I have used the Friends of Ed books in the past and found them to be excellent tutorials. The Foundation Flash book and the Flash MX ActionScript aare well-rounded, and cover the ground they set out to do, albeit wwith errors here and there.I bought the Friends of Ed Macromedia Flash MX Studio, expecting similar coverage reflecting advanced concepts for design. Much to my regret, I found this to be a book on ActionScript. The examples are essentially trivial tricks done with ActionScript, with descriptions that suit some aspects of game design.To contrast, the Flash MX ActionScript book published by FOE focuses on many of the concepts used to build Flash applications... and is a book that would be useful to designers who wish to use Actionscript when developing a Flash Project.Macromedia Flash MX Studio was a waste of time and money."
4,ZSparkling,"This CD, like others of this duo is excellent. Musical clarity and crispness are superb, really enjoy this CD."
4,"Lovely content, poor production","My son adores this book and, truly, it is the only book I have been able to find that sets up the expectation for my nursing toddler than someday he will no longer nurse. It does a great job celebrating nursing and even weaning and tells a very relateable story. My only issue with it, for which I cannot fault the author, is that the book is very cheaply produced and appears more like a photocopied journal, than an actual book. However, this does not detract from my son's enjoyment, and I am grateful to find a book that will lovingly aid in his gradual transition towards no longer nursing."
4,Shotgun . 87th Precinct,"If you put the good characteristics of each dectective into one man, you'd have a man to drool over. I like them because they are all different ... like in the real world. The 87th precinct books are difficult to put down.Seems I often see day break.Bess"
5,Makes you wonder what's up,"I enjoyed the book very much. I just couldn't put it down, as with all of McBain's books. The 87th precinct series are very realistic, as is this book. He goes into great detail. The story is very believable"
2,Disappointment and not my favorite 87th Precinct,"Having read many mysteries, legal thrillers, police procedurals, etc. I guess I had a level of expectation that I didn't get out of this one. For some reason this felt, to me, like it wasn't written by an adult for adults. The dialogues felt a little too contrived -- as though written by a beginning writing student as opposed to a professional writer.I also felt a lack of intensity, no sense of urgency, to get to the end to find out who did it. Overall this was my least favorite 87th Precinct. Just didn't do it for me."
4,Better than I expected,"I bought this book as a joke for someone (male) turning 30. I figured it would be a bit ""girly"" but was intending on using it as something thrown in with other items. To my surprise, it was a nice hard covered book with with delightful tidbits of information and well written for either gender. Well worth the money. I would recommend if you want as a thoughtful little something or a ""just in case"" gift, whatever, it was perfect. Thanks Amazon for your prompt delivery!"
2,30's book,"Condition of book was perfect but disappointed in content, gave to my son in law, thought it would be light & funny but instead too focused on sexual content...kind if embarrassing coming from his mother in law."
4,Cute for a 30th Birthday Gift,"I purchased this book as a gift for one of my good friends who is turning the Big 3-0. I looked through it prior to wrapping, and it has cute facts about being 30, as well as stories on where celebrities were when they were 30 (I guess that celebrity section is supposed to make us feel better about ourselves if we haven't conquered the world by 30? :o)Cute gift idea."
1,drivel,"30 is an arbitrary number. If you have nothing better to do than spend your life wondering what other people your age are doing with your life, then buy this. Personally, I have better things to do with my time, and my life. I live my life by my own goals and expectations. I could care less about what other people do with theirs.Yes, I actually made an attempt to read this book, but every page I turned to was completely worthless. Whatever you do, don't be a dick and buy this for someone on their 30th. You're basically telling them that they should start measuring their own self worth against other people. It's a horrible thing to do to somebody. Buy them the new iPhone, or take them to dinner, or send them a greeting card; but don't buy them this worthless waste of space of a book."
5,This book is hot.,"This book is really awesome. It has a bunch of cartoonsand facts about people turning 30 years old, so it'sgood for people turning 30 years old and it's goodfor people who know someone who is 30 years old.(BTW, I heard that 30 is the new 21, which is awesome.)This book is good stuff, and it's mine. Mine!"
5,The new sound of House,"Rinocerose has ventured into new territory...and boy does it sound great!...combining elements such as funky latin beats with catchy guitar riffs and some groovy basslines...from the opening beats to the albums's first track, which you may have already heard without even knowing it, on a VW commercial that's currently airing on TV, to the end of this 53 minute album, it's just non-stop high-energy house...these french dj's have found a winning concoction in Installation Sonore...my favorite track is ""Rock Classics, Vol. 1"" which owns a downright funky beat with bombastic bass supporting it...323 Seconds is another great track along with the innovative album opener...the latin influenced Le Mobilier is another one worth your attention...my reccomendation to any fan of excellent party music, or house, or funk is to obtain this cd with utmost brevity! Five stars! enjoy."
4,tremendous,"this is one cool cd.it has a very latin housy feel to it,and has varying tempos, so there isnt that monotony that some house albums have.definately not an album to browse through,must be played from start to finish to be appreciated"
3,"Honestly, I Expected More","My first album by Rinerse was the dynamite ""Music Kills Me,"" which took house to new directions with its fuse of drum loops, guitars, flutes and jazz influences. However, a lot of people were seemingly disappointed with the album and suggested that I get their debut, which they say is better. While many of the jams on this album are indeed above-average, ""Installation Sonore"" is overall weighed down by filler in the form of subpar tunes on the latter half of the disc. ""Radiocapte"" is what we've come to expect from this group: innovative beats, strong hooks, and impressive flutes that add a classy touch. But by the end of the disc, things get a bit patchy with lesser material. I'm not in any way bashing this debut; it's a competent effort that would pave the way for their superior followup, ""Music Kills Me."" It's just that I think it falls short of living up to the raves it got upon release."
1,"""Cumbersome""","My biggest complaint with this unit is that it constantly needs replacement filters that are both hard to find and expensive.The internal filter starts to grow mildew and deteriorate after as little as one days use. Without the filter, the unit does not work.If you're looking for a humidifier that needs to come out of storage fast and rescue a kid with a cold, forget about this one. It wants tons of attention and upkeep that is both annoying and expensive.Also, the unit is noisey and the construction is cheap.For me, this has been a huge waste of money."
1,95% obsolete,"This is a 1975 edition, so only has value if you are completely new to the field. Probably good in its day."
4,An Amazing Chamber Reduction of the Gothic,"Reducing a novel full of large scale Gothic gestures to a chamber opera for five characters, no chorus and a chamber orchestra is no mean feat. Michael Berkeley and his librettist David Malouf have succeeded to an astonishing degree. Although Jane's early years are left out of the telling, pretty much everything else is ""in"".Berkeley's music is in an approachable atonal idiom. (More Henze than Nono- with a tonal theme based on ""Verrano a te"" from Donizetti's LUCIA worked in to the scenes of the crazy wife in the tower.)The music seems an ideal evocation of Gothic mood. Interestingly, Berkeley defies operatic convention and casts his hero, Rochester as a Bass rather than a tenor.The singers are uniformly excellent, and the instrumental playing is first rate.A fine sound recording."
5,Thrilled with purchase!,"I bought this for my sister as a Christmas gift. I was so glad I was able to find it, since Fiestaware Black is retired. This item was shipped promptly, packaged very well, and arrived in perfect condition. I am very pleased with this transaction and my sister was thrilled with her gift!"
2,Good for 11+,I do not recommend this book to anyone younger than 11. It has tough words and adult authors.
4,Great buy!,"The selections are not as great as the first one but still, you get a lot of previously good & unreleased unplugged performances by REM, the Cranberries, Tori Amos, Seal, Sheryl Crow, Phil Collins & Elton John!!"
3,Good but not as good as Volume 1,"I had volume 1 for years and then discovered volume 2. I had high hope that volume 2 would be as good as volume 1. Alas this was not to be. It's a good CD but lacks the honesty and gritiness of volume 1. It's to commercial, the music is not as intersting."
5,Unplugged 2!,I have been looking for these discs for months. They are a great addition to the collection. I'm very pleased.
3,MTV Unplugged V.2:,"Some artists don't do as well as others do when unplugged. I won't get into names here.Some of them don't need to be plugged in to sound great.Disk is a mix of good and bad, but would buy again for the gems.Shipping in an padded envelope ensured that the case would be cracked upon arrival. (not such a big deal I guess)"
2,defect in sweater,"the sweater was a little snug, I would order next size up, however, at the 2nd wearing I noticed a hole in the arm seam about an inch in length. Better quality control is needed!"
3,Exploring Utah,Looks like interesting and informative book about Great Basin National Park. I will have to travel there when I'm finished with college and have vacation time
3,Interesting Enough...,"I got this because it was required for a course that I'm taking, so it's not exactly like I was passionately driven to buy this book. I don't particularly care about psychology so the explanations and figures in the book are still boring, but the book does provide a stimulating insight into how we make decisions (it helps that the book isn't a textbook per se). But if I had just bought the book for the fun of it, I think I'd still only feel so-so about the content. Then again, this is coming from a psychology-apathetic perspective, so I don't know how someone who's interested in the field would feel."
4,Book for school,Book was received in a timely manner and in very good condition. Who could ask for more.
2,Terrible book,This book is terrible to read. I purchased it for a class and will be letting the instructor know this is not a good text book.
1,Very Disappointing!,"- Video: Digital artifacts & color gradient rendering flaws are readily apparent.- User Interface: Awkward to navigate, unforgiving, and very, very time consuming.- Set up software: Useless, lacks configurable options available to the frame forcing you to fumble through the frame's poor user interface.- Flickr support poorly implemented.- Remote control is a cheap piece of junk."
4,The fundermentals are good,"I bought this for my mother after very careful research into all the frames on the market. When you boil it down you need1. A good looking picture - has that2. Wireless - so she can see the pictures without having to download, get emails etc. I found it easy to set up. The frame updated itself afterwards which improved the interface.3. Good integration with picture sharing sites - let's face it Flickr is the the best and so having that built in is essential.4. It carries on where it left off - other frames don't do this. Why the should the user have to tell the frame to pictures from the internet every time you turn it on - that's madness. So if your set it to use Flickr then it will do that even after you turn it on and off again. Plus you can set it to goto sleep at night and wake up in the morning, saving power and the screen.I found the remote worked well, it's no different than my Bose remote that's 10 years old and still working fine."
1,Worst frame I've ever used,"Won't connect to wireless networks. No hard-wired fallback. Maybe a firmware upgrade would help - but no wireless=no upgrade. Bummer.Crappiest, most overpriced frame I've dealt with, and frankly one of the top 5 worst gadgets I've ever bought.The other negative reviewers were spot on about its user-hostile interface, obtuse layout, cheesy transitions, and disappointing connectivity. Skip it and get a D-link wireless frame."
1,Not worth the money.,"I wouldn't recommend this product.Although this product is fine for sharing pictures on a SD card, it falls short of expectations if you wish to use the wireless feature or share pictures from a web site such as Flickr. I'm still not able to connect to any web site. I've tried to use Flickr, Windows Live FrameIt, MemoryFrame, Webshots and an RSS feed. None of these web sites work with the MemoryFrame MF-8104.Since you are paying for the added Wifi and Web Site picture sharing features, it really isn't wortht the price."
2,Wireless doesn't work,"I bought this frame because it had the features, resolution and aspect ratio I wanted. I was nervous about buying a brand I had never heard of, and those fears turned out to be well-founded.Althought the item was packed well, there was minor damage to both of the included wooden frames. Oh well...this is just how things are made these days. However, the wireless feature did not work which is a deal-breaker. Whenever I attempted to search for a wireless network, I received a message stating an ""unexpected error had occurred."" The only way to get it to go away was to power the frame off and on again. I thought a firmware update would correct the issue. Updating the firmware was a pain and did not fix the issue anyway. So, the frame is going back.What a waste of time and a terrible Christmas gift. Pictures loaded from an SD card or USB device looked fine but I still would not recommend product."
4,Pirates of the Caribbean 2 - 8 Pkg Figures,My son really likes these figures. They work well with the 2' Pirates of the Caribbean ship he got for Christmas . You can attach them to the deck of the ship and a trigger is used to allow them to move back and forth to look like they are sword fighting. Although sometimes it can be difficult to get the figures to stay attached or even get them attached. Very detailed figures with accessories.
4,Good reading,"I have read eight of the Gail NcCarthy books and enjoyed all of them but recently have found that I am skipping pages as the author,Laura Crum seems to write to much about the landscape or decription of houses and horses..Having said that I would still buy more of her novels about Gail McCarthy as they are enjoyable."
3,All the songs sound the same and feel empty,"The music is technically well played, voices are clear and have a nice pitch, and songs are well harmonized. Yet, the hymns felt empty. The cadence, rhythm, and tempo of every song sounded similar to one another. CD lacks emotion."
5,"11"" bar mixing spoon",Real nice spoon for the long reach. I have been looking for a long spoon Qt. jugs. A good stainless steel spoon. I would have bought a 1/2 dozen.
3,Will do the job...,"Got this yesterday, full of Black blemishes and the actual spoon part is badly made, the metal is not smooth. I guess you get what you pay."
3,A bar spoon.,"Just a plain bar spoon. I was a little disappointed in the quality of the metal, rough edges and not very shiny. But it works."
5,Good Long Spoon,"Excellent stirring spoon, capable of mixing even the Iciest drinks with one fell stirring! As a Bonus, i can also crack my beautiful girlfriend upon the crown with it when she becomes ornery after too many cocktails."
3,Inspirational!,"This cd is perfect for a relaxing evening when you're having a bad day or even if you just need that extra little burst of happiness! It is god driven and full of spirit. Anyone sick of harsh and disturbing lyrics can turn to this cd for a refreshing positive feeling! Enjoy! (It can be a bit boring at times, if you're not in the mood and that's why it got a 3)"
5,Art indeed!,"If you've ever wanted to learn the nuances of playing brushes...this is your video. The hosts ask the questions that we, as players, would want to ask of these jazz greats, given the opportunity. Being more of a visual person, I particularly enjoyed seeing these players demonstrate their approaches to playing with brushes and hearing about the players that most influenced them."
4,A Great Hat,Minus one star because I bought the wrong size originally. However this hat is very durable and will fit any head perfectly. The inside of the hat doesn't have the standard baseball hat netting so it forms to your head very comfortably. It is very true to size as well. Make sure you buy the correct size for your head. I have a large noggin and I bought a large hoping it would fit. It doesn't.
4,Good music!,"Ok...why isn't this on the charts?? I love the song ""all i am."" a great tune! The songs are well produced and well played. The CD flows well and keeps you interested in what's next. I want to hearthis on the radio."
2,"jungian, shmungian","I really like some of Davies' work for its narrative drive and fresh characterization. However some things continually annoy me about him and they are very present in this novel. Firstly, I find it intellectually revolting how he still clings to such old-fashioned, reactionary ideas such as Jungianism (or that kook Joseph Campbell), and uses ""archtypal"" patterns as a way to formulate a story. Also his characters have an annoying habit of believing themselves to have ""figured everything out"" when really they just have a bunch of stuffy ideas that they will not let go of. In other novels by Davies these things annoy me but they are easy to ignore, but this novel is fully made up of such things."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed with my order. The order said SET OF 2 BASSINET SHEETS and I only received 1.I emailed and their reply was the order is for only 1. The sheet is very thin and luckily I purchasedthe waterproof cover and I will also use an extra blanket just in case. I was very disappointed that Ireceived only 1 sheet and not 2.
3,It fits onto our vintage bassinet,"Yes, it fits. The fabric is very thin and cheap. I put a blanket over the sheet so that my baby doesn't have to sleep on this sheet."
5,"Incredible, Mr. Toogood!","Initially I bought this book for its beautiful and inspiring watercolors. Is there nothing this man can't paint? Breathtaking clouds, the wettest water I've ever seen in paint. You wouldn't know it from the cover, but the book also contains a chapter on portrait painting, step by step. He is as proficient in portrait painting as he is in landscapes, cityscapes, seascapes. I teach a ""portraits in watercolor"" class and I recommend this book to every student of the medium who is searching for an artist they can admire, who is willing to part with his ""secrets""."
3,Incredible Light and Color in Water Color,"This was not what I was looking for in watercolor books. I did not like the realism that he taught, but it may well be that for those looking for intense realism this may be a good book."
3,Warning,"This is a good book for those who want to paint watercolour copies of photographs. Unfortunately, Mr Toogood doesn't show that part of his working method involved in tracing the photographs he copies. If you're looking for more expressive styles, study the work of Winslow Homer or John Singer Sargent. If you want a good instructional book on watercolour, check out Mastering Atmosphere and Mood in Watercolor by Joseph Zbukvic."
4,Funny and Good,"A quick read about a nearsighted heroine. Most of the characters in Regencies never have flaws but in this one both sisters have them! Meg can't see and her sister, Angela, is a bit flighty.Meg does end up in an improbable situation as a governess to Lord Bryn's niece and nephew after getting into the wrong carriage. But it is fun to read how all the characters tangle themselves in impossible situations which of course end up happy. The villainess in this case is very mild (I liked that) and gets her due in the end.A fun, quick, entertaining read."
3,Could've been better....,"Regency romances are my favorite genre for light reads. This promised much with its plotline--also a favorite--a genteel lady gone to be a governess. In the best of these sorts of stories, the lady is a wizard at witty conversation. The lord is a grudging admirer. They butt heads and ultimately come together. This writer stretches 'ultimately' to untold depths. Characters are not particularly well developed, or admirable. The villains are so villainous as to be almost ridiculous. And one of them even changes his mind about his part in the plot at the end. After a long stretch of will-they-won't-they get together, the denoument is like the snap of a rubberband, from stretched position to rest. All is lost, until the last couple of paragraphs of 'and-they-lived-happy-ever-after.' I was disappointed. The plot did not deliver on its potential."
4,Entertaining,"Story was entertaining, not sure if the premise was realistic, but that is hardly the point.My personal star rating would have been a 3 or 3.5, a very okay read. But I am a very tough rater, don't think I've given more than 4 stars to more than 2 books in the last two years."
4,Fun Story,I loved the different view on the traditional Regency novel. The books was well written and well thought out. I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys Regency novels but is getting a bit bored with the same story line over and over.
4,A Lady's Point of View,This was a cute novel. I enjoyed the fact that all of the conflict was because the heroine had poor eyesight. Read the rest of this review here: [...]
4,not beckley greatest compact disc but,really nice to have them still on the map they started in the 1970s their pop soft californian music flavoured still reach some highs on chasing the rainbows
2,Maybe I listened to a different disc set,"Let me start out by saying America was one of my favorite groups growing up....i.e., from the very beginnings of the group. After about the first 6 albums, I lost track of them, and only recently ""returned"" to the fold, back-filling what I missed in-between. The first disc in the Here and Now collection, IMHO, is merely OK and, for some of the songs, there is a better version in some of the live discs. As for the second (live) disc....ouch! I now have four of their live discs (this one, the King Biscuit disc, Wildwood Springs, and Grand Cayman)....this one is not in the same class as the others (song collection is fine, recording and performance are not). Given what I thought of first disc, I was hoping the disc set would be salvaged by the live disc...just didn't happen for me. Sorry guys....I'm glad most folks had a better opinion, we're just going to have to agree to disagree."
3,Not as good as I remembered,"I saw America live a few years ago and they were amazing! However, I found this cd set a bit disappointing. One cd has new cuts on it and the other has their older stuff performed life. I prefer the cd with their old songs on it, but the quality I heard a few years ago isn't there. It's a decent cd if you don't pay too much for it."
4,New Disc is Good,"The new CD is good, though it sounds like all of their other stuff, I didn't notice the influence from the younger folks. The second disk - the live session is awful; throw it way use it as a coaster."
4,Almost.....,The CD is good and I'd buy it again but it's not as good as their earlier work. My favorite has always been Holiday. I sure wish all their work were available on CDs
3,Here & Now by America,"The new songs are okay, but sound as though they are trying to fit-in with what is currently popular. America's last effort, ""Human Nature"", and the one before that, ""Hourglass"", were much better efforts. On the brighter side of this effort, the live CD is very good. However, when Gerry Beckley sings ""Don't Cross the River"" and ""Woman Tonight"", they sound very different from the original versions, which I believe Dan Peek sang. Other than that, the live CD is very good."
3,Anemic,"You got to hand it to these guys for their persistance. I saw them in concert last year - A++++ really a good show, very professional. Unlike the concert, the new music is anemic. I listened to the CD over and over and the songs seem to belend in together - nothing stands out. Maybe they need to get Dan Peek to help write some songs, the magic was the 3 of them."
5,A Surprising Great Collection of Songs!,"This is a two CD release - one contains all their old hits from a live performance while the second contains a collection of new studio recorded songs. I can't say I care for the live recordings - the originals always sound better to me. However, the new songs are amazingly good! This is their best work to date (and I always felt their initial ""America"" album was ground-breaking for the incredible instrumentals woven into well written songs). It is great to see quality composers who get better with age instead of washed up as is too often the case. I cannot remember when I have been so impressed with a new album release - and I have been around for a while."
3,Long timers still doing good things,"I remember my brother bringing the first AMerica album home and hearing Horse with No Name for the first time. This album shows them to be doing some good things still, at this point in time. In particular, ""Love and LEaving"" may be the strongest song they've done since Horse. Others of note--THis Time, Indian Summer. The whole album can be a bit uneven, with tendencies toward bland pop and ""advice"" songs, but definitely some cherries to pick here."
4,A Very Appropriate Title...,"I really enjoy this project on a couple of levels. First, this is new stuff for America, and second, this project has all of America's standards which were recorded live in 2005.Actually, America's new stuff feels like America's old stuff which why I probably like ""Here & Now"" so much.I know Dan Peek has not been with the group for years but in my mind any way he is conspicuously missing! All in all however, Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell did a great job with ""Hear & Now"".I must admit though... I really miss America ""There and Then"""
4,Old School Pop/Rock Done Right,"Having never purchased an America album, I bought ""Here and Now"" for the hits done live here. I was, however, quite surprised with the quality of all the new studio songs here. I wasn't expecting much from the new songs but they are all really good pop/rock tunes that harken back to the good old days of the 1970's - - while still sounding current and fresh. Their take on Nada Surf's ""All Is Love"" is great. Working with the younger artists has paid off for America. In a perfect world, pop radio should be playing these new tunes. But we all know that older bands are just about shut out of any radio playlist these days. Too bad, because there are many tunes here that would sound fine on radio."
3,"A good read, but could've been better","I was greatly disappointed with this book. My father served with Project Delta (one of Project Omega's sister units) and I was hoping Project Omega: The Eye of the Beast would give me a greater insight into the types of missions my father ran. Unfortunately, Mr. Acre spends far too much time recounting his exploits in garrison, which gave him VD five times, and almost had him court martialed for marijuana use. More attention needed to be paid on what it was like to run long-range, covert ops with one of the Army's most elite units. Anyone interested in this fascinating chapter of America's involvement in Vietnam would be better off reading John L. Plaster's Sog : The Secret Wars of America's Commandos in Vietnam."
5,review,"Finally a book that doesn't concentrate purely on combat. Ernies'book tells the story behind the SOG missions. It tells the reader how it really felt to be part of the SOG brotherhood. You learn how they acted between missions ;their partying,grief over lost friends,the way they lived with the constant danger.If you're interested in SOGs'combat ops read Plasters'book ""SOG ,the secret wars but if you want to learn about the men behind the missions ,this book is for you.A must read. I'll forever have the utmost respect for SOGs'recon men. To those who criticise Ernies' book ;he'has seen the elephant',have you ?"
1,A Sham,"...As a former member of Project Omega (Det. B-50), almost right from its beginning, I was not only surprised but angered at Ernie's failure to report very little of historic significance, versus focusing on his own misadventures. In one case, I beleive Acre has committed the unforgivable journalistic ""crime"" of falsely making himself party to the tragic loss of SFC David ""Babysan"" Davidson, one of the original Omega recon team leaders and MIA to this day. Project Omeaga's recon activiites made an extremely valuable contribution to U.S. military operations and the accuracy of the intelligence gathered resulted in thousands of lives saved. This book should not be accepted, in any way, as an accurate portrayal of the men and mission of Det. B-50"
2,Read Plaster's book first,I couldn't agree more with reviewer from Salt Lake. This book is more about Acre's exploits while back at the base rather than actual missions ran in Vietnam. If someone wants a real look at the missions run by SOG during the Vietnam conflict read John Plaster's book.
3,OK-but it's a tripper,"Got this gate for between the living room and kitchen. Liked the idea to pass thru and wanted a nice looking one that was pressure mounted. Well, the drywall is still messed up from the pressure points. Too loose and it can be pushed over. I can't count how many times we have tripped over this thing. This is coming down soon, being replaced by a gate mounted with hardware and without the bottom rail."
3,"ok for now, but...","i wouldn't be surprised if the parts of the plastic handle didn't stand up to regular use, since opening the gate involves a 3-step sequence. plus, i find you need to use 2 hands to open it. the HANDS FREE GATE IS SO MUCH BETTER than this, but we had to get this one because our entryway was too narrow for the hands free gate."
4,Nice gate!,This gate is nice looking and blends in nicely with my decor. I purchased the gate for when my grandchildren are here so ease in set up is of importance to me. I found no where written in any reviews that each time this is set up all four tension pads need to be screwed in tightly. I thought the tension was on springs or I was hoping. This gate is very secure and takes only a few minutes to set up. The lock system is good but even adults need two hands.
2,NO PARTS?!,"Recently purchased this item for our new baby girl who is beginning to crawl and explore. Thought it would also be nice to keep her and the dog separated during this time since she seems to key in on trying to get a hold of our dog's tail. Read over many of the reviews and looking for the right dimensions that looked nice at the same time. Finally settled for this one after hours of shopping, I received the gate today open the box and that's all I see, just the gate... Missing several parts that were suppose to come with it, including the mounting hardware for the gate, and no 24 hr customer service either. Not happy with the performance or standards of this company that is suppose to be highly ranked on consumer reports for pressure mounted baby gates. Somebody within their company seriously fell asleep at the wheel on this one. Planning on having a word with the company in the morning and will post later how good their customer service really is..."
1,Save your money,"I was so disappointed in this book. I thought there would be multiple techniques (using gel medium, burning tools, etc) and thought it would be great to have a bunch of techniques in one book. I was sooooo wrong!Basically, this book is just a huge advertisement for Lazertran products. EVERYTHING in this book requires some sort of product from Lazertran, which would be fine if it was titled ""The Lazertran Book of Image Transferring"". If you do buy the Lazertran products they come with instructions, so don't waste your money on this hardcover advertisement!"
1,disappointment,"I agree with the disappointments of other people. As I was reading them I was just confirming my own findings. In a nutshell , yes, instructions are clear and illustrations are beautiful, except the photos are staged and do not reflect real results, and the instructions are misleading and have errors. I would like to hear Lazertran's opinion since their name is in every project. Save your money, find more reliable instructions, and consider other brands (many are twice less expensive and have been tested by other than Debba Haupert.P.S. I was't even done typing when I got a response from Lazertran, who I sent my questions to earlier. They were prompt. Here is what I copied and pasted from their answer:""She is quite wrong. The book, by the way, has nothing to do with us. We have a CD book that covers the inkjet version as well as all our other papers.""Now you don't need my opinion. Make your own conclusions."
2,Dissatisfied,"Overall, the book is not bad.I believe there are important information missing from this book.I failed in my first image transfer project."
5,The Great Cuban Patriot,"It was wonderful to find the Marti's ""Poesia Completa"" book. Since I was raised and educated in Havana, I knew most of the verses by memory. It is great to have the full collection. Thanks Amazon. You did it again!"
3,101 Ways to Jump Start your Intuition,"This is a puny sized book. It will fit into your pocket. The way the book is laid is that it is a daily reminder type of book. It doesn't teach anything at all. It is like a 365 day reminder or thought for the day type of book, not an instruction manual or book."
5,Great little bood!,This is a great book to put in your back pocketand read if you have down time at work orsitting in a Doctors office.
5,"""Ways to Stimulate Your Intuition""","""101 Ways to Jump-Start Your Intuition"" is a great book on steps that you can take immediately to activate and increase your intuition. What I also appreciate about this book is that it is very easy to carry around, and can be read within the span of less than three hours (very vital if you are extremely busy, and crave knowledge that helps towards personal spiritual evolution). The following are some very helpful tips that are recommended to look at right away upon recieving the book:1) Lesson 77: Using Your Creative Side on page 1592) Lesson 46: Strengthening Your Aura on page 973) Lesson 44: Knowledge on page 934) Lesson 34: Dreams on page 735) Lesson 5: Journaling on page 15""101 Ways to Jump-Start Your Intuition"" is a very helpful, soul-nourishing, and informative book to obtain if you are serious about enhancing your intuition, having an intuitive enhancement guide that is easy to travel around with, and many who have a busy schedule."
4,"small, but focused",This little book is entirely focused on manifesting and recognizing your intuition. I found it helpful.
3,"For what I paid, OK!","Glad I didn't spend the money on the book, downloaded it on kindle! Mostly just lots of common sense ideas!"
5,great book,"the book is small enough to put in my purse. Every time I have a few minutes alone I read it. It has short tips on how to become a more relaxed person, and open to receive ""messages"" from above."
5,A Classic Science Fiction Novel,"The cult classic TV series that airs on TNT during weekdays at 6:00 AM to 7:00 AM is what encouraged me to buy this book. I noticed that the first season of the television series follows the book almost to a letter, the second season starts to stray away from it, and the third kind of does its own thing. All in all, a very great book that would inspire many great things even today. I really recomend this book toanyone who loves science fiction, dinosaurs, or adventure stories. I have seen the 1925 black and white silent movie and it was okay, but there is a BBC / A&E production with up to date special effects that I have yet to see but will buy when chance can come."
4,The Lost World - Arthur Conan Doyle,good fiction read; interesting. characters are developed well. a touch far fetched as humans are taken back to the jurassic period. but suspenseful and hard to put down.
3,enjoyed it,The Lost World was exactly what I was expecting. A read about adventure in a foreign continent with an interesting (and fictional) scientific take.
4,EASY READ FROM CLASSIC AUTHOR,"NICE, EASY READ FROM CLASSIC AUTHOR. EASY TO FOLLOW STORY AND WAS EASY TO KNOCK OUT IN A SHORT TIME."
3,Imitation of Jules Verne,"Arthur Conan Doyle, at the age of fourteen, learned French so that he could read Jules Verne in the author's original language. So it's unsurprising that Doyle's ""The Lost World"" (1912) shows some influences from Jules Verne's ""The Raft; Eight Hundred Leagues on the Amazon"" (1881). In fact the writing style of ""The Lost World"" seems, to me, more like Verne's style than the familiar crisp style of the Sherlock Holmes stories. The idea of finding dinosaurs deep in the Amazon is a bold one, and guaranteed to appeal to the popular imagination, but in general I would say that Jules Verne is better at this genre. ""The Lost World"" is without a doubt more thrilling; Verne's ""The Raft,"" which is also full of adventure, is more realistic and gave me the feeling I had really been to the Amazon."
3,Light adventure novel about a mysterious plateau land,"This enjoyable novel led to the silent movie, and is similar to it in much the same way as Jurassic Park was to its movie. That is, they are a bit different, although the basic outline and characters are the same. The scientific claims of a Professor Challenger as to the existence of a land sporting unusual fauna is challanged by the London Zoological Institute who send an investigating expedition to the plateau. As for the insitute, there is a fair amount of passion for science and opinion, which seems unrealistic today. Shouting down, rioting, etc. The story is told as a narrative by a journalist who goes on the expedition because of his girlfriend. There is much less emphasis on dinosaurs than one would think, and does not have the gripping quality of Jurassic Park. But it probably deserves a 3 1/2 star rating."
2,Read three pages,Read three pages then just decided to netflix the old silent version which was quite good.I do like the Sherlock Hopmes stories by the author though.
5,An old favorite,One of my favorite books and authors.... Love the lost world so much and for those of you who may be confused this is NOT the Jurassic Park one!!! It is so much better! (yes I had a few friends get confused on that fact)
2,I waas turned off in the very beginning.,The idea of an island or world with all kinds of weird/crazy animals did not hold my interest. To be honest I read only a little before giving it up.
3,"Not the TV show (or Jurassic Park, for that matter)","I was drawn to this little novel because of the crazy-cool and sometimes dreadful syndicated drama TV series of a couple years ago. While the TV series followed Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original story to some extent, there were changes to characters and some of the storylines. Conan Doyle's original is very much an adventure tale mixing elements of myth vs. reality and a scientist's quest for vindication. There's just a touch of romance, but it's more action than anything else. Recommended for Conan Doyle fans, of course, and adventure-lovers, but not necessarily for fans of that TV show -- of which I might be the only one, anyway!"
4,great read,"has always been a classic, and always will be. what else do you want to know? when have i typed enough to be submitted"
1,Tedious. Really would have given it a 2.49999999999999999999,"This book's style of writing was to bore you. All the other of Doyle's books are so cool! Was Doyle in a coma when he wrote this? It had a non-exciting plot but on a mildly exciting subject. If you want to read Doyle, read ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"""
5,Better than Sherlock Holmes,"When you think of Arthur Conan Doyle you quickly conjure up the sleuth Sherlock Holmes. However, Doyle is better yet in this early science fiction, but you kind of wonder is it really all fiction ? This Vernian-like novel commands your attention instantly. The characters are so well defined you can visualize them, hear them and imagine them as real living human beings.I had acquired an early hardback edition that with its illustrations draws you even deeper into the story which ends only by giving you a hint of more to come. If as a kid you ever experienced the serial movies when movies where ten to twenty-five cents and had to come back the following week to see what happens next, this is a novel you will surely enjoy. If you are younger and like Indiana Jones you can enjoy this and maybe write a sequel."
4,Nice edition of 'Lost World',"Good inexpensive edition of ACD's ""Lost World.""Comes with a nice (though overly hyperbolic and post-modernist) 15-page introduction, and 10 pages of ""explanatory notes."""
4,Not the Same?,I don't know but the item I received was the item I thought I had purchased. I knew the coloring would not be the same as shown in the picture. I don't know anyone who shares the same coloring as the white background this necklace is pictured on. The lighting used in you're real life will not be the same.It's a great necklace.
4,Pretty Good Stuff!,"I somehow missed this band when they came out in the 80's, even though it seems I have almost everything from that era. So I bought this based on the reviews from you all posted here. I was not disappointed! This is a very straight forward CD, although the vocals seem to be mixed much louder than the background instruments. This is not necessarily bad, as the vocalist is very good. For those of you really wanting to know what this band sounds like.....I would say a West Coast version of Tuff Luck (sorry if you don't know that band, but no other really sounds close to these guys). Maybe a touch of ""Killer Dwarfs"" thrown in for good measure. Although many of the reveiws here (as well as in the CD booklet) claim these guys as ""harder than their peers"" or ""less refined"" or ""rougher around the edges"", I did not think so. It's just a slightly different sound from the stuff that was being put out in L.A. at the time. Enjoy."
4,Vain - 'No Respect' (Gottdiscs),"Sure glad that I have the available room to store old CD's and lp's.Also glad that I rarely discard anything of such.I remember seeing Vain play a late gig in a club on the same night that Motley Crue was in town during their 'Dr.Feelgood' tour.That's how long it's been.I didn't realize that years later,Vain had released two other CD's,2000's 'Move On It' and 2001's 'Fade'.I'll have to check those out sometime.Anyway,I always thought Vain would stick around longer than they originally did after the release of 'No Respect'.Overall,just good glam rock&roll with a kick to it.Happening cuts were ""Beat The Bullet"",""Who's Watching You"",""Laws Against Love"" and their love song(well sort of)""Icy"".Line-up:Davy Vain-vocals,Danny West&James Scott-guitars,Ashley Mitchell-bass and Tom Rickard-drums.Should appeal to fans of Diamond Rexx,L.A.Guns,Roxx Gang,Dangerous Toys and Hanoi Rocks."
5,glam in the 80's,"great sounding cd. one of the coolest glam bands of the 80's.still putting out cd's to this day. great sound, great look and great band. pick it up if you like bands like: ratt, crue, ect."
5,A Classic!!,"I loved Vain in 1989, and I still love them just as much today. I was so glad to see this album FINALLY released on CD. I'd just about worn out the second tape cassette of this album I'd had squirreled away, and only listened too when I really felt I just couldn't do without my Vain fix anymore."
2,Ugh,"This book, full of silly cartoons and conversational language, was not worth much to me.If you have just been diagnosed, are part of the target audience (I'm in my early 30s, younger than most with this disease), and don't know much about autoimmune diseases, this might be an OK place to start. It won't give you much that you can't find online, though, and the author's tone is chatty in a way that I found annoying, not engaging."
4,captivating and flirtatious...but what a [terrible] ending.,"...i have to admit that i was somewhat frustrated with the book's ending. From the very beginning i was expecting Giardina to take Luca's frustrations to a higher level instead of just conveniently blaming all his sexual confusion on his parents. I thought it was really wishful thinking on Giardina's part to have written an ending so perfect and convenient with the two children being punched out to complete the 'awww...' factor. It was such a let down, contradicting the book's earlier, realistic portrayal of human emotions and life in general - The restraining of ones thoughts, the desire to fit in , the inability to address our fears and that nothing turns out the way we want it to. Nevertheless, I was glued to every page, especially the childhood years and i really took a liking to Lou and Bob's relationship. i thought it was really sweet. Anyway, as much as the ending may have been disappointing, I would definitely recommend the book."
2,just another story...slow,"This book sounded like it would be really interested, but as I was reading it, I could only think how boring and uninteresting it was. It had its moments that made you think it could get better, but the overall story was just dull, in my opinion. I would not recommend this book to my friends to read."
4,To be determined,"We just received these are beginning to track my cycle, however I have to give them a decent rating as I am not knocked up. Will update next month."
2,Would not purchase again,"It is my own fault. Nothing with the product, but now using this, I have a tracking worksheet that does the same thing. So as long as you remember daily to update your worksheet, you can use that instead of buying this - an Excel spreadsheet is free. I was a little surprised with how large it is as well. I wouldn't buy this again only because I didn't think it through before I bought it, but another consumer might like it."
2,Make it yourself,"In all honesty, don't spend the money to buy this ... make it yourself or just simply be diligent to keep track of your period cycle on a calendar."
3,It's alright,"Cycle beads were in perfect condition. Great idea, you just have to remember to move it each day. When you have to move ahead several days, it's not the easiest to move, but, it's not that difficult either."
1,Useless product,"This is a useless product, i used it as instructed plus used ovulation test kit when in doubt and managed to get pregnant within 3 months when i was trying to avoid pregnancy.This is no good!"
4,Cycle beads,It's a nice handy tool. I am not sure if this alone would be enough for birth control however. I had to continue to mark a calendar because I was tending to forget to move the beads along.
4,Cimmaron,"This movie held my attention just from the historical point of view.The story of the taming of a frontier by the people who came prepared and those that weren't and all caught up in the same struggle to make a life.Very good entertainment, Thank You."
1,totally overrated,"this is the worst western I ever saw, not because of the story, but because of the so called ""stars"". I cannot believe Glenn Ford the role of the Oklahoma Wigwam editor, he's not a writer with the gun in his hand and he doesn't speak like a writer.Maria Schell is the worst actress in any western. She is a ""Heimchen am Herd"" in a German Heimatfilm, but not a brave woman. She is unbelievable whiny, always unmotivated grinning.The only highlight is the land claiming race - so only 1 star."
1,Not a good cleanser...,"I don't like how many facial cleansers leave my face feeling dry and tight. I was using Clinique Liquid Facial Soap in the Mild formula, so when I saw the Extra mild, I thought I would try it. Well, it was like washing my face with Crisco... It didn't remove my make up, particularly eye makeup, (I don't even wear waterproof...A good cry removes more eye makeup than this cleanser did) and it didn't rinse clean. I always had to wipe the excess cleanser off with a towel, and it always left a smeary mascara mess around my eyes. I gave it to a friend to see if it worked any better for her...she threw it out. Don't waste your money on this..."
2,not great..,This cleanser is overpriced and does nothing for my oily skin. I'm a skincare junkie so i've been around from high end to low end and this is no different than a neutrogena or clean and clear cleanser. If u want good products switch to dermalogica.
2,Most depressing book I have ever read,"This is the most depressing book I have ever read. It goes on and on about the drugs that killed Elvis and is soooooooooo boring. If you want to try reading this book, rent it from the library and be prepared to feel down while reading it. I have read books about funerals, corpses and death that were less depressing than this book. Don't waste your money."
5,The best book on Elvis' deat BY FAR!!,"This is the best book on the death of Elvis that I have ever read. The book goes very in depth to the last moments of his life, his drug use as well as the role played by and trial of ""Dr Nick"" as well as the cover up of the official autopsy report. I would consider this book a MUST READ for any Elvis fan or even forensics fan."
4,Interesting,"I found it very interesting, although an awesome and strong book for Elvis fans.Now I want to read Dr. Nick's version to the facts."
3,Strong Scent,"The bottle is beautiful and the scent is nice, but very, very strong. I would not buy this for a young person or anyone that does not want the whole room to know what she's wearing. I don't want to totally bash the product because it does smell good, it's just way too strong for my personal preference."
5,made a great mother's day gift,"i bought this for my mother for mothers day. she is in her 40s and loves to dress up/go out etc. she (and i) absolutely loved the scent of this perfume. the bottle and box are very fancy and definitely give it a great and expensive flair. the scent is sophisticated, strong and memorable yet isnt intoxicating. i dont know if its because of who i got this for, but i dont think i would recommend this for younger women (20s?)."
2,Nice smell but does not last long,"I tried this product in a store once and loved it. When I saw the incredible price here, I immediately ordered one. I still adore the scent of this perfume however it does not last more than a hour or so. I have to carry the bottle with me whenever I go out and it is getting frustrating!! So think twice before you buy and save your money."
4,fast shipping!! Great product for the $,The chairs were perfect! Only thing they didnt mention was they needed assembling. But who care when they were a third the price of furniture shops.
2,This movie bite the dust,"I could had swore I saw this plot before, but I'm being too kind giving it two stars. But since I got to see the goodies from from Miriam and Shawna it wasn't a total waste."
2,Not all interesting,"Not all interesting thought it was a thriller, turned out to be a dud. It was a boring movie with no purpose or theme, this is just to satisfy your ***** and it does not deliver on that too."
4,Hot,Miriam McDonald is sexy. I've watched her grow up on degrassi the next generation to now doing this damn fine
2,poison ivy 4 the secret society,i seen all the others but this one was modern according to the times' but the story line was exactly as you expected but the sequels of events were too quick and story line took awhile to catch up to the movie...you see but it's later the characters all come together and you see how they all are related to each others' and the movie's
5,complete history of the USMC,"Very good book,well written the seller was great and fast on the shipping. Highly recommended thank you."
3,Enjoyable,"This is the third in The Chronicles of Mavin Manyshaped. Himaggery is missing, and Mavin seeks him. Another enjoyable addition to the series, but again with a more linear story than the True Game trilogy of Peter. This story also provides the background on which the trilogy of Jinian will build."
5,Wonderful shape shifters and world-building,"This series (and author) is one of my favorites. While I didn't care for the series finales' ending (in Jinian Star-Eye), all books in the Land of the True Game are well worth the read. And unlike so many books today, they are a manageable size. The three Mavin books are great, possibly the best in this unique and special series."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Mavin sets out to find the wizard type she has a thing for, after hefails to show for a prearranged meeting. Hoping he is not dead, it isquest time again."
4,Good Deal!,"I purchased this for my mother's wheelchair, as hers was old and worn. The item was a really good fit and higher and very comfortable for my mom. Quality was good, comfort, fit all good, and the price was right."
1,disapointed hunter,"Through a gift exchange in our family, we ended up with three(3) of these cameras. After 10 hrs of trying to get them to work and multiple trips to the woods i still cant get one of the 3 to even opperate. They constantly freeze up and wont allow me to set them into picture mode. They are the most fusterating camera i have ever used. Not 1, not 2, but all three function poorly. I own a video buisness so electronics are second nature to me. I cant express my opinion enough DONT BUY!!! ALL 3 OF MINE ARE GETTING SENT BACK!! I hope this saves you some time and agony."
2,Very slow to start,I bought this camera to replace a film type Stealth that I had used to watch a watering hole on my property and find that although the pictures are very good (sharp and clear) the delay befroe shooting the picture is unaceptable. I have many pictures of the tails of animals that are leaving the area. The battery life is overstated as I have used two batteries in one month and only taken 45 pictures. If you intend to put this camera on the trail you might want to connect it to a golf cart battery in order to have it last for any length of time.
2,Fine for deer but not much else,"I got one of these cameras for Christmas and was excited to see what type of animals were around my house. I put out some food ( cord, seeds, cat food, fruits, etc.) and waited to see what I got. I got many pictures of deer but nothing else, I could tell that other animals were eating the food but i could not get any pictures so i decided to put up my night vision security camera to see what I was missing. In 3 nights I got videos of deer, skunks, cats, rabbits, and a fox. The camera got pictures of all the deer but nothing else even though I got video of larger skunks running around right where the Game Spy was aimed and still nothing. On another note the camera eats up batteries, The store brand 6v's I have been using last about 5 days so I'm switching to rechargeable. The positives of this camera would be that it produces clear pictures and is easy to set up."
5,good product,"very good product, I recommend ... In addition to being very responsible people when making shipments. I recommend it 100%"
1,Los calzados recibidos no corresponden con la seleccion hecha.,"El vendedor debe revisar las opciones, Me enviaron unos calzados de recien nacidos y seleccione uno de ninos, mi hijo esta muy molesto."
4,clacica,es la marca mas clasica que recuerdo y eso es lo que motiva a adquirir cualquiera que sea la prenda
1,unhappy,"this item was out of stock when i ordered and i was never notified when it or if it came back into stock. it's a shame too, my grandson was really looking forward to getting them."
1,cheap shoes -- poorly made,"the shoes LOOKED nice when i got them -- unfortunately the tongue came out of the right shoe 2 days after i got them. no way to return them since they were worn and no way to repair them....BOTTOM LINE - i'll stick to NEW BALANCE shoes bought locally from now on. i have 3 pairs of NB shoes and all of them have held up much better than the Reeboks...if there were a way to rate these shoes at ZERO stars, i'd have done it"
5,Gaiman is as engaging as ever w/ this slightly skewed novel,"Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite authors of all time and I was relieved to discover that his talents extend far beyond comics. Neverwhere is somewhat ""Sandman-ish"", but there's something new and different about this dark, offbeat story that you won't find in the Sandman. Gaiman's narrative is positively some of the best I've read, and it genuinely frustrated me to have to put the book down. Great stuff.Granted, the book doesn't measure up to the quality, wit, or poignancy of ""Good Omens,"" but Neverwhere is a whole different animal altogether. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to any other book-lover. It's imaginative, artistic, visual, and very intelligent. Yes, there were predictable moments, but never annoyingly so. All in all, it was a great book that I do look forward to reading again."
5,"5 stars, damn near perfect.","It's nearly two a.m. in the morning where i am, and i've just finished reading this novel. I have to say, i've never read anything quite like this book. Adventure pretty much sums it all up, in one word. Hell, reading it was like living a real adventure, only in my mind, my imagination. Which is, of course, where the best and most perfect of adventures usually take place. Strange and weird and fanstastic. And i loved every second of it. I won't say what the book is about, but i will say that if you like grand adventure and fantasy, then give this excellent book a try. You'll probably love it as much as i did. Or perhaps, if it is at all possible, a bit more.Oh, and beware of doors. Or, mebbe, look for them.Hawksmoor...From The Bleed."
5,This book rocks!,"The cover caught my eye first. But the story exceeded even my highest expectations. This was my first book of Gaiman's. There was never a dull moment. I visited London once, and Gaiman's attention to detail was like touring the city once again. Afterwards, I bought American Gods without hesitation. If you enjoy sci-fi/fantasy, buy this book!"
4,A fun setting for a journey of self-discovery,"Like pretty much any of Gaimans stories, the setting is a surreal other world within/below/parallel to our mundane everyday world. In this case, it's the story of the protagonist's journey from being a nice but spineless guy leading a mediocre life where his friends treated him as a commodity, to becoming a confident, brave person, and eventually realising what's really important to him.The main criticism raised by the reviews that only give a couple of stars is that the plot is extremely simple. That's true. But it's not the point. The inner journey is meaningful, and the setting is enchanting."
4,Neverwhere<---- perfect title,"This book was my first read of Neil Gaiman. It was highly recommended to me, and couldn't put it down for long. I would have given the book five stars if I could have related to the main character (Richard) more. I didn't like him much, too weak for my taste, however other characters were very rich and unique. The things I liked best were Neil's writing, the humor, and the unpredictability of the story. I laughed out laugh several times. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy reading a fun story where anything goes."
5,Neverwhere,"Gaiman has an unusual ability to make you simply accept things that are not real, but are close enough that you slip into them easily. This is the second book I've read by him and found it to be a delight. I actually read it several months ago and have found that it's a book that stays with you well after you've finished it."
5,It is rael it is now it is everywhere,"I was on my way to work on a dreary Saturday moring. The office was empty. I was the only one in that day. I finished the last page of the book in the lobby and went upstairs. I kept thinking i was seeing images of shadows walking in the empty hallways of the office and through doors of darkened offices , my hair stood up and I LOVED IT!!!!!!!Needless to say - if you read this and American Gods it's safe to say you will read everthying that comes out of Neil Gaiman.It is rael, it is now it is everywhere!"
5,A Great Read,I was tempted by this book for quite some time before I finally picked it up. I'm now sorry that I waited. It was well-written and quite a treat to read. I'm now looking forward to American Gods...
4,Modern Through the Looking glass...,"As said in another review, if you have ridden the London underground, you believe in ""minding the gap"" between the station and the trains. Nice guy Richard Mayhew, falls through the gap to London Below, to a world of bizarre characters on a dangerous quest, while discovering a few new things about himself. Good reading, social commentary, and highly imaginative, keeping you intereted through to the end."
4,A fascinating world,"This is the first book I have read by Gaiman. I wasn't really sure what to expect when I opened it. I had heard such great things about him but for some reason I still wasn't convinced he was going to fall short of my expectations.Boy was I ever surprised. I loved this book. The story was fantastic and the characters were lovable (even as I hated some). Door was adorable and I even loved bad Mr. Vandenmar. I was literally laughing out loud at almost everything Mr. Vandemar said...""What,"" asked Mr. Croup, ""do you want?""""What,"" asked the marquis de Carabas, a little more rhetorically, ""does anyone want?""""Dead things,"" suggested Mr. Vandemar. ""Extra teeth.""-page 205Gaiman created a world that was exciting, captivating, and even frightening but he also gave me something to think about. He took reality and shifted it so I now see a story in the shadows. I want to go to London and read this book there. I want to read this book on the Underground. I can't wait to read more from Gaiman."
5,Who knew subterranean civilizations could be so interesting.,"The novel, Neverwhere, instantly became one of my favorite stories. Neverwhere features Richard Mayhew who finds a strange world that exists under London and challenges everything he thought was normal. The author, Neil Gaiman, uses great descriptions to make the novel come to life. Everyone should enjoy it because of its unique story line and humorous twists that kept me interested as I read it. Neil Gaiman writes interesting ideas that really make this book pleasantly different, although I have been told it resembles Dark City. I found Neverwhere to be written excellently."
3,"Compulsively readable, but ultimately disappointing","I read this book with pleasure, but it was the kind of pleasure that I get from eating junk food: it was fun while it lasted, but I didn't get much out of it.Not that this is a ""junk"" book. It's well-written and entertaining, and some of the images are quite beautiful. Its great asset is its atmosphere -- its rich setting, and the wealth of visual detail. Underneath that, though, there's nothing much. The plot is a standard quest story, and, more damningly, the characters are thin. The ""once you've had a taste of magic and adventure you'll never be satisfied with a conventional life"" ending is, well, an awfully conventional fantasy ending. How ironic."
3,"""Neverwhere"" - all form, no substance","Neil Gaiman's ""Neverwhere"" certainly has potential for greatness. The story line was intruiging, the characters (mostly) likeable, and the setting unique. Unfortunately, it was lacking the magic of Douglas Adams' (who Gaiman has been compared to) work in the ""Hitchhiker's"" Trilogy and the ""Dirk Gently"" series. I was waiting for something great to happen, and something finally did - it ended. I still enjoyed the story, but it would have been better if written by someone else."
5,Magical and Wonderous!,"As a child I loved three authors - Lewis Carroll, J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. As an adult I've found bits of the same magic in Stephen King and Robert McCammon and a smattering of other author's short stories (Clive Barker's Cabal for one).I was completely captivated by ""Neverwhere"" the way I was captivated when I first read ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"". I could not put this book down, and I actually cried when I was done. I didn't want it to end!I am so happy to finally find a writer who weaves the worlds I would love to be lost in as an adult. I've recently read ""Stardust"" and am stacking up everything else Mr. Gaiman has done."
5,Amazing,What an amazing read. From the minute you pick this book up YOU will not want to put it down. An outstanding plot with twists and turns from beginning to end. The characters are alive and vibrant. The fantasy world created here is astonishing. How London and above and London below contradict each other yet seemingly intertwine with one another is incredible. A must read. Trust me!
4,The London You Will Never See,"Mr. Gaiman writes in a genre all his own (though I did read a story about the Rat King and his son saving the world from the Pied Piper, which is sort of along the lines Mr. Gaiman writes). This is a story of London underground and the lost people who live there. The interesting part is that the hero is some ordinary bloke, who does not act like a hero, or trys to be a hero, but the essence of heroism is that he is there and is true to his people."
4,The dark world of London Below,"Neil writes excellent fantasy and in this book he takes us to a city below a city. I love this idea and find it fascinating that such a world ""exists"" underneath. Characters Richard Mayhew, Hunter, the Marquis, and Door set off on a quest for information. Richard wants to restore his world to normalcy...but what really is normalcy? Can normalcy be so fulfilling? Richard will never be the same...and neither will you. I like this story where the homeless and underdwellers can be heroes...where rats are respected and are viewed as friends.Refreshing and stimulating."
4,Very good,"This is my favorite Neil Gaiman book. Although at some points it's hard to follow, overall the story grabs your attention and keeps you from putting the book down until you are done."
2,A tragic disappointment.,"I loved Gaiman's work on Sandman, among other titles, and thus eagerly awaited this novel. Never before have I been so frustratingly disappointed. Neverwhere is predictable, clumsy, garbage -- unworthy of such a normally original and creative writer. I recommend any Gaiman fan stay away from this book, as it may irrepairably damage their opinion of him."
