5,Awsome,Feels incredibly realistic. You definitely have to ease onto it but once there it it fantastic. Easy to use to get to the right spot and keep there.
3,I should've listened,I should've listened to the reviews that said it was super big because it really is and I can't use it which is a shame because it feels great.
2,This thing is huge!,"It looks lifelike, so I give it an A+ for aesthetics; however it is simply way too big for me (and for the normal person, I would imagine). To give you an idea, it is difficult to even fit a regular Trojan or Durex condom on this sucker. It's fun to play with, though. I just wish it was a half-inch or so smaller in diameter."
2,Waaay too big!,"I bought this product thinking it would be average length, and average girth. Boy was I wrong! This thing is waaay to big, can't even use it! Im giving it 2 stars cuz then length is fine, but the girth is too much!"
1,Smells awful. Way too big.,"This toy is made of rubber and the smell is quite intense. It is a turn off for me.It is also too big: 6.5"" of insertable length and just above 2"" in diameter. It is only for experienced users.I do not recommend this toy."
2,HUGE.,"I should have taken a cue from the other reviewers, this thing is WAY too big, I can only get the tip in. It looks nice and has a nice texture, but I can't use it. I'm probably going to go for this Real Skin All American Whoppers 6 1/2 Inch Super Flexible Dong instead."
3,Way Too Big,"I bought this for my wife, and it is way too big for her. Being a normal sized guy down there, maybe a bit above average in length, I thought she'd enjoy something a little girthier. But she hated it. We tried on 3 occasions (she's a real trooper) to make this thing work for her. We used LOTS of foreplay and quarts of lube. It was still very uncomfortable for her.It has a very nice feel to it, looks extremely realistic, and has a good flex/firmness combination. So I'm giving it some credit for the overall construction. It was shipped to us quickly, and showed up in a very discreet box.I don't understand the reviews by these women who love this thing. They must be used to coke can wide men. Some loose ladies out there I suppose. Wish they had something of this quality and price that was engineered for a human rather than a female elephant!!!"
1,for private use,Do not prefer it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it because it is not for me
3,Entering interesting,An enticing but short-lived contact high of femmed-out electro-soul which bares light replay value save for liberal glow stick wavers.
1,A waste of 90 minutes,"This book reads exactly like a newspaper clipping from the 50's. I doubt very seriously if the writer even bothered to go to Nebraska to do any research. As far as the writers attempt to investigate the legacy of the (Archetypal Gun-Crazy Killer Couple)as portrayed in other films, I fail to see his comparison between the killings and the movie True Romance. Tired? Can't fall asleep? Buy the book then. Otherwise save yourself some money."
4,Ghosts of Tsavo,"A gripping tale of studying lions in their native habitat. However, the author got off track on at least two occasions presenting his personal philosophy on issues that had nothing to do with studying lions."
3,Kind of meh,"As others have stated, the book is a little brilliant at times and downright boring at times. I think mostly I am left with the feeling this book is a little incomplete. Sure, there were some fascinating biological debates and moral questions, but still it seems there are too many incomplete themes.I notice ONLY the 5-star ratings are gettng voted as ""helpful"". So you probably wont think this review is ""helpful"". So what, go ahead and buy the book. When stacked against Capstick, and Corbett, it doesnt even rank."
3,Parts of this book are quite good,"I rate this book only three stars because of the way it seems to drag at times when discussing scientific field work and theories. Even the author seems to share that opinion. That being said, parts of this book are quite good. I especially enjoyed the first section of the book where an account of Wayne Hosek's pursuit of a modern day man-eating lion is related."
2,Lions in Africa,I like wildlife stories and hunting stories.But this one was not my speed. I was a bit disappointed.Others may love it.
1,An interesting work,"The author tags along on a couple of scientific studies and reports what actually goes on. Very entertaining and enlightening but the theory that proved most promising is discounted in a similar study so we still don't have the answer to why the lions are maneless. But, that's nature..."
3,Almost made it,"Caputo is pulitzer winner. As such, I expected much more from his book. He seems to pose a basic question, ""Are the lions in Tsavo genetically different?"" He spends a great deal of time interviewing scientists about this point. He arranges funding for a study to be done. He goes to Africa, to Tsavo with some scientists. Where, according to his own account, he tells them that he doesn't want to know! He doesn't want science to de-mystify his world view.In the end, he never really gets an answer. He also, seems to find it curious that lions should be man eaters. While in Africa, he is constantly asking professional hunters, long time residents and scientist to explain how this could be. Sorry, I don't understand why the question even has to be asked.In the end, the book left me frustrated."
3,Depends on what you're hunting for.,"I am planning a trip to Africa, so I ordered this book and then I saw other books that had been recommended, so I found a second hand copy of ""Man-Eaters Motel"" by Boyles and ""The Man Eaters of Tsavo"" by Patterson. There is quite a difference between them, obviously. Patterson's book was great because he is the source. He is the one who killed the lions of Tsavo. Boyles' book is incredible. Not only does he tell the story of the lions better than anybody, I really loved all the rest of the information about Kenya and the railroad there. It is also really funny in places. Caputo's book is good if you are interested in more of the scientific-type information. I wish it would have been more exciting. My wife liked it because Caputo took his wife along on the trip and write about it from that perspective."
5,A very good read,"I read the book by John Patterson, who killed the original maneaters of Tsavo (Did you all see the ""Ghost and the Darkness"") and this book was even better. A very good read and deserves five stars."
4,My son likes it,"I would've given this 5 stars but you have to supply the button batteries for the laser gun. The batteries are common and can be found at any store (A76) but they should've supplied them.We blew up the balloons and pop pop pop, time to blow up more. They are little so parents won't get 'winded'."
1,Poor design,"Good idea, poor execution. It's unfortunate that they didn't at least give you small, square tubes with a hole in one side in which to blow up the balloons to (1) create the appropriate pin-balloon contact and (2) position the balloon appropriately. Getting the tension of the balloons just right is a challenge compounded by the fact that the balloons themselves are extremely cheap. As was mentioned, they have a tendency to pop while being blown up and others quickly leak to the point of insufficient tension. If it wasn't for this frustrating aspect of the game I could tolerate the need for constant adult intervention."
2,Wall Mounted Hair Dryer,"After six years with quiet very effective baseboard heaters we recently were convinced to install these units in a couple of condo's we own. They are basically wall mounted hair dryers. Not only did tenants lose wall space in every room but unlike the baseboard heaters they can't put anything within 3' of the units. Don't put one in a kitchen any place near a garbage can if you can avoid it or you will blow hot air smelly air into your house.They also off-gas (and set off smoke detectors for the first couple of hours of operation). At night the fan switches on and if you are a light sleeper it will take a few nights to not wake up repeatedly throughout the night. The units are easy to install though and are almost flush to the wall (about 1/2"")These might be the first choice of contractors but they would not be my first, second or third choice for small units or sleeping areas."
5,Great strings,"Perfect for my Guild 12. They last longer than uncoated strings, and keep their brightness for a long time. And they're less expensive than elsewhere."
5,amazed,"What amazes me is the fact that everyone is concentrating on dead bodies (even people who like it). Has anyone ever heard of anthropology? What about anatomy? This toy simply says that if you start with this (the base) and take into consideration the different factors (pegs) which help the features take shape, then the finished product is what you end up with. These various pegs are what help us to look like us and not the person down the street. We are all the same underneath but there are subtleties that give us our unique features. Kids are not as macabre as adults as you can see by the reviews here. Adults are the ones that pass along their fears and views to their children- this is a perfect example. DO not make more out of it than there is. How you choose to present it to your child is up to you but it all breaks down to basic anatomy not whether or not you watch CSI."
5,Perfect,I could not put this book down. It is written very well and is an excellent story. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn hard word the fun and easy way. My vocabulary has improved tremondously by reading this book.
3,my son does not like this book,"The concept is good, but my son, who usually likes to read, hates this book."
5,Inspiring,"I wish that the ""Dixieland"" bands of today, replete with their plastic boaters, and red and white striped vests, had 1/20th of the talent and raw energy of this group...and a repertoire to match. I thoroughly enjoyed this set, and look forward to obtaining any other material that exists outside of this set.One minor issue of musicianship: the clarinetist from Disc 2 onwards is decidedly mediocre at times: a very thin tone, sloppy phrasing and mistakes that don't equal the quality of playing by the other band members. Perhaps some might like to excuse this, but it reminded me of the marginality of Jelly Roll Morton's reedman on some of his 1930 Red Hot Peppers recordings, except that the booklet praised this man's work. Well, we differ there. Johnny Doods, Jimmy Dorsey, Jimmie Noone, Barney Bigard, Albert Nicholas, et al, he is not!Otherwise, enjoy!"
2,Whoa...,"First, I'll say that George Saunders' two short story collections are two of my favorite books. I've reread them more times than I can count. I also go to the trouble of tracking down his new short stories as they appear in various periodicals. I'm a pretty enthusiastic admirer. So I went straight down to the bookstore and bought it on the day it was released. And then I returned it the next day. I couldn't finish it (and it's only about a hundred smallish pages.) It read like a pretty cliched book for children written in an imitation of Saunders' voice. For those who are familiar with Saunders' work, I would say: Read the first ten pages or so in the store to get an idea of what this is. To those unfamiliar with this author, I would say: Pick up either ""Civilwarland in Bad Decline"" or ""Pastoralia""; this book is definitely not representative of this man's talent."
1,"I Love George Saunders, But...","I am a BIG FAN of Saunders. He is one of my all-time favorite fiction writers and I have read his other two books countless times. I can see Saunders's talent in ""Phil""--I laughed aloud at several parts--but the books lacks anything that makes good writing great or worth re-reading. This book doesn't have the energy or the magical/undefinable qualities of ""Pastoralia"" or ""CivilWarLand in Bad Decline.""This book shows talent, but, as the New York Times said, this book is ""the comic voice without the woundedness or anger that truly animates the satirist, like Saunders himself in his earlier work. ""I have to agree with that last statement."
2,not a fan,"Very cheap looking, and the pink bow with the red tights was not at all what I was expecting.. I was not impressed and didnt even wear them to the event I was planning on."
3,Just nice,"This album is instrumental, and, while they are very good musicians, the best part about FFPT is their wacky singing. For their best, get Firehouse Five Plus Two Crashes a Party. For fine instrumental, get something from the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. This CD has decent remastering, clear sound, and a good selection of tunes. Almost a ""4"", but since we can't give halvies, I have to give this one a ""3"" rating."
5,Well Written and Very Comprehensive,This is an excellent book for those looking for a simplified approach to retirement funding.
5,Buckets Of Money,Buckets of Money: How to Retire in Comfort and SafetyGreat read and very helpful for anyone who is saving for retirement or is already retired. Ray's radio show is also a good place to obtain investment planning material.
4,Finally a simple method,"Whenever a financial advisor's starts to speak, I yawn intellectually. There are so many products and financial terms that I can't grasp it all. Enter Lucia with a plan so simple that even I can understand it. I loved listening to the ""The Ray Lucia Show"" and the book did not disappoint me.""Don't run out of money before you run out of time"""
5,A good strategy,"This book is a great book, especially if you don't have a plan already. Ray Lucia puts his thoughts together in an organized manner, and easy to understand. Too often, financial books get into industry terminology that just get people confused. This should give any investor at any age a good grip on how to make financial markets easy.The book is geared more for folks that are about to retire or are within a few years of retirement; however, the book is very good for those that have several years to retirement as well.If you have no investment plan, then I recommend this book. If you have a plan that is working for you already, then you may want to stick with that plan. But it never hurts to look at another type of investment strategy, which is exactly what this book is...strategy."
1,SEC Charges Radio Personality for Conducting Misleading Investment Seminars,"SEC Charges Radio Personality for Conducting Misleading Investment Seminars.""According to the SEC's order instituting administrative proceedings against Lucia and RJL, they held the seminars highlighting their Buckets of Money strategy in an effort to obtain advisory clients who would be charged fees in return for their advisory services. They promoted the seminars on Lucia's radio show and on Lucia's personal and company websites.""A Google search for sec gov buckets will bring up the charges."
4,Easy to understand,"This is not really a book about how to amass your retirement savings, but rather what to do with it when you are retired. The system is simple. You have 3 buckets. In bucket number 1 you put your money for the next 5-7 years. Bucket number 2 is for the next 5-7 year period after that. And finally, bucket number 3 is for the money you will not need for 10-14 years. The book then discusses the proper investment choices for each bucket, how to rebalance them when necessary.The plan makes sense and seems simple. The only part I was not entirely clear on is when to move items from bucket 3 to bucket 2. Maybe I missed it. In any case, the book was a good read and I plan on reading it again when I get closer to retirement.I'm looking forward to Ray's next book (the radio show is good too)."
5,Excellent book for a more realistic approach towards savings and retirement.,"In some ways this book is like the other books out there: work hard, save money, let it compound. However, he does preach something that no other book I have read teaches. Most people say you save all your life and then you retire, and that is where they end their story. They focus on all the ways to save up enough money to retire and live off the interest. However, for most people that is impractical, and impossible for some. This book on the other hand gives you a good way to think about how to deal with your money in stages, and realize that retirement is not the end of your investing. Easy read, lots of good info, not too many stats to bog you down. Overall, very glad I read it."
2,"There is no warmth, it just 'moves' air","Been using in my truck cab to help limit frost on window during cold nights, it does not do what I expectd."
3,Ok Active Directory Book,This is a good book if you are starting out with Active Directory. The book compares older versions of Directory Services to more recent Active Directory services.
3,A good summary guide,Good guide covering the most important items in Tuscany in a to the point fashion. The map with scenic routes indicated are a plus.The aim of the guide (in my opinion) is for travelling through tuscany.Not the right guide for detailed city info.
3,"Missing ""Classical"" Act.","This recording of Mefistofele was made without recording the ""classical sabbath"" act with Elena, so that it would fit on 2 LPs. Nothing that was recorded is missing. It was recorded in Mono in 1955."
5,We love it - different voices are not very noticable,"My almost 3 year old daughter loves this DVD. It was an Easter present this year. In the Easter set of episodes, the voices of Max and Ruby are slightly different, but I hardly noticed. It wasn't until we watched it several times that I noticed a slight difference. My daughter didn't notice at all. All the episodes are super cute and we love watching them together."
4,ELOQUENT AND HUMOROUS NATURE WRITING,"Eloquent nature writing with a sense of humor, sure to delight any reader of down home country living. Author Doug Elliot's chapters on the natural world are lovingly researched anecdotes on the critters, plants, folklore, and people that compose North America's natural environment. An ex-hippie, Elliot is adept at speaking naturally with a scientific appreciation of the mystery and wonder of nature, whether he's hiking for an elusive mystical Ginseng root, or revealing a prized recipe for Dried Apple Stack Cake. Stories of native American folklore, particularly stories of Coyote The Creator, a hapless though efficient god-like being are delightful fables retold here in amusing moral ending style. Mr. Elliot has also illustrated his companionable book with splendid artwork revealing an artist's eye for the love and fascination of the natural world."
2,More like VBE for Dummies,"The sample code was very simplistic and I felt this book was more of an introduction to the Visual Basic Editor than VBA in total. While understanding VBE is important, better coding examples would have made the book a better purchase. Also note that Access VBA is somewhat different than the rest of Office Applications and this book gives Access shallow treatment."
1,Constant confusion.,"I was in a state of constant confusion. The author was constantly using unexplained jargon and unexplained code. For example on page 48 there is some code that has #If..#Else..#End if, and there was no clue what the #'s were all about. Something important I suspect.Over and over again one undefined item is explained with another undefined item so I kept feeling like I was sinking deeper and deeper into dummie doom. For example, on page 45 the class module was defined as a container for a class description. Sooo... what is a class, a class of what?I am getting something of value out of the book, but even some of the English grammar makes me cringe.There are just too many ""what does this mean"" moments for me to recommend this book."
2,"Not a ""for Dummies"" book","After read the first eight chapters, I have to say goodbye to this book.John wrote the first few chapters with us ""dummies"" in mind, but when he started to write chapter chapter 7 - Interacting with the User and chapter 8 - Object-Oriented Programming, he totally fogot who he was writing for. Even worse, you need to read chapter 8 first and than go back to chapter 7. John put you right into the jungle without explaining the concepts clearly. I am sure he knows a lot, but he failed to deliver.Conclusion: it's not even a good textbook, certainly not a ""for dummies"" book."
1,Unbelievably poor,"The book is an absolute mess! The explanations are vague and unfinished. Codes wont execute easily and lots of confusion will be there to run a simple program. Most of the time you need to change a setting, add a refrence or be fully aware of the naming. You end up down-loading the auther's code to know what is happening. Very difficult to follow if you dont have any background in programming. I have read 14 chapter and I have no confidence in writing even a simple program. More important chapters are poorer than the others. OOP and XML chapters are good examples. very disappointed specially because I have to go and buy another book and start over. I wonder if its true that this is the fifth edition of this book."
2,Not a great introduction to VBA...,"Format is a little scattered, and topics not nearly explained enough. You would be better served using another resource for a good intro to VBA.And the accompanying CD is pretty much worthless. Nothing of great value on it."
2,more of a philosophy book,"If you are looking for guidance with the nuts and bolts of writing VBA, I don't think this book will be helpful. It's more of a primer about how to write software in general than a book about writing VBA. I've found other works more useful. Maybe as I learn VBA this one will come in more handy, but I wouldn't recommend it for ""Dummies."""
1,Didn't help me much at all. Shocking.,This is probably one of the worst books I have read dealing with this subject. For a start is no use giving a beginner a little bit of code and saying it fits into a bigger lot of code eg. lots of code starts with ... then some code ending with ... what is a beginner supposed to do with that. The part chapter on passing values to sub routines was bad. I paid AUS$69.95 and feel I wasted my money. I should have returned the book and got my money back.
1,Examples don't make sense and confuse!,"Other than this book, I have had a wonderful experience with Books for Dummies. The real problem with this book is that it does not provide continuity or examples that are real life. I beleive the author thinks he is cute or funny, actually I purchased this book to learn something. I did not! As a result of this experience with this book I will be more careful in the future and actually have to go and peruse the book at a book store before I buy it. This is not good for e-commerce!Leslie"
2,VBA is for Programmers,"VBA is Visual Basic-lite for wanna be programmers who have graduated from users. If you have dreamt about becoming a programmer, this book is for you. If you are a user, thinking that magically something is going to happen... You can stop drinking the Dummies book kool-aid right now, cause it ain't gonna happen.Bottom line is... you can put lipstick on a pig and call it VBA... but its still programming."
2,Not great. Does have some value.,"I found this book nowhere near as helpful as other Dummies books on VBA programming. If you want another good starter book, I would recommend ""Access 97 Programming for Dummies"", which is full of real world examples that will help you understand VBA.The author just seemed to get too cute with the subject matter. Also, the lack of real world examples really hurts this book. You can't step into object-oriented programming when you decide to invent your own objects for everything.The explanation of how loops work is okay and the constants information is not bad. Overall, however, get a real technical book and try to learn it that way. It will be harder, but you will be better for it."
3,classic + rock,"As a collectionist it is likely to get this one. It contains nice pieces to play on any party, except a hard rocking one! But use it as background music for your next birthday party, and get your parents-in-law moving on the beats of those heavy rockers, so next time you'll play the real stuff they recognize it in their subconsciousness and start rocking right away!"
5,THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED ANALYSIS OF MUDD'S COMPLICITY WITH JWB,The Notes' section alone is worth the cost of the book!
5,A Must for Assasination Buffs,"A True account of Mudd's involvement. Though he cried foul, ""The guilty dog barks the loudest""."
1,"Good Service, Terrible Blender cup","Down through the years I have bought several cheap blenders from whatever discount store was in town. Never had much of a problem except the gasket may wear out or tear. When that happened just as easy to replace because they were so cheap to begin with. The L'equip is the most expensive blender I have ever purchased and it received a great review in Cook's Illustrated. I have to say I am very dissappointed. The plastic blending jar is very cheap. For unknown reasons the underside of the cup developed cracks. They did replace it. Now the blade has developed a crack. Again they were good enough to replace it but this is getting ridiculous. I have never experienced this with any of the ""cheap"" machines I have purchased. I would recommend against purchasing this product.I will say that unlike another 1-star reviewer I have had very good customer service from the company that handles l'Equip."
1,Loud and obnoxious,"After returning my first L'equip because the blade assembly broke, my second blender showed up after a long wait. Like the first one, it is obnoxiously loud and doesn't do a good job of mixing anything but liquids. It has a hard time with bananas. To me, it sounds like it's broken and I feel like it probably will soon. The RPM meter is just an electrical current meter for the motor, so it doesn't accurately count RPMs--it's just for show. Maybe I got unlucky twice, but otherwise, I can't see what all the 4 stars are about."
3,No big deal,"I don't why, but I was expecting amazing things out of this machine. While it does blend with the best, well, in the end, it is just a blender. I have a Cuisinart CBT-500 that is not far behind in performance (although it is ear splitting loud). Plus, the RPM meter of mine never reached 20,000. For the price, I am not all that impressed. And the 6 year warranty probably is unnecessary. I have had a $30 blender for years with fairly steady use and it hasn't burned up (just don't overload the blender, you have to add things as you go). I also didn't like the plastic pitcher as I prefer glass. And to top it off, I am pretty sure mine was refurbished (it had a few nicks on the housing), which was the final blow and when I decided to send it back. So, not bad, but nothing special."
2,Hunka Junka,"Bought this item two years ago for power plus price. The blender ring broke right away and I had to ship it for repair. The speedometer has never really worked correctly and eventually broke. The blender, when it does work, is powerful. The blender ring recently broke again. If you get a good warranty, go for it, otherwise, save your cash for a blender with a good warranty and track record."
1,Be cautious...,"(Revised) We bought this product based on a review by Cooks Illustrated, normally a reliable source. Here is what is wrong with the blender:1) It is huge, it will not fit in or under most kitchen cabinets. Forget about leaving it on the counter.2) The plastic jar is cheaply made, feels cheap, and broke within 18 months (although, the jar was quickly replaced for free after I completed the task of tracking down the US distributor).3) The RPM dial only works about 10% of the time.Would add a couple of starts to the original review based on the quick and courteous jar replacement."
1,Doesn't Work,The first unit's RPM meter did not work and it smelled like it was overheating. The second unit's RPM meter did not work. I ended up sending both units back. I think I'll get stuck with shipping on both units. This buying experience will probably cost me $40 to $60 in shipping.
4,Chose this over a Vitamix,"I really wanted a Blendtec but had a hard time justifying the price so I went with this L'equip. I wanted to mostly make green smoothies and am happy to report this does a fine job. My dad owns a blendtec and says he gets the same consistency I am getting.I start with 1-2 cups water and add grapes, pineapple, oranges, apples, kale, carrots, celery, frozen berries etc. and some flax seed that I ground up with this blender. After about a minute I end up with a very drinkable liquid, certainly nothing you could chew any further. I would say this is on par with a Vitamix, I have only had it a few days though so hopefully it will last a while. Atleast Replacement parts are cheap and the warranty is 5 years, 1 year for the carafe.Bottom line, If you can't or don't want to drop the 4 bills for a blendtec, get this. You'll be pleased."
4,The Heavenly body Review,"I thoroughly enjoyed The Heavenly Body. Hedy Lamarr is absolutely stunning in this one, and her wardrobe is terrific! Those '40's styles were very cool, even by today's standards. This film isn't deep & philosophical, but is merely an entertaining piece of work. And based on that, it works very well. As long as you don't think you're getting Lawrence of Arabia, you can easily watch this film and enjoy it. The only flaw I saw: There were a couple spots near the end where I thought they stretched just a little bit to pull certain parts together (some revelations came a little too easily to the characters without working out just how they came to that conclusion). This didn't spoil my enjoyment of the movie, however. It's a very nice film and worth it for the pure entertainment value."
4,A nice little comedy,"If you like William Powell this is pretty classic vintage. As the astronomer husband with an astrology obsessed wife Powell is set up with lots of good smirks and one liners. You have to appreciate his sarcasm and wit to really appreciate the movie. Hedy Lamarr is as always looking great and here plays a role that calls for a mildly dimwitted portrayal. I figure she likely gets panned for roles like this one, but as a woman who is supposed to give in to her horoscope so easily she could hardly play the part as a brainiac. Spring Byington is really funny as the nosey next door neighbor/troublemaker. Jeff Craig is a little stiff as the ""other man"", but handles his part okay. Each time I watch this film I enjoy it a little more, especially when you catch more and more quips by Powell."
2,no closed captioning,i liked this movie when i saw it on turner classic movies which is why i bought it. sadly it does not have closed captioning and i am hearing impaired. turner classics had closed captioning when they showed it. i am disappointed in this movie. i spent too much for it to begin with and i cannot enjoy it.
4,Good!,Its a really good manga from akira toriyama. and it was refreashing too see his art work again in something other than dragonball. Definately get it.
4,better than I thought.,"this is from the creator of dragonball, a series I am not a fan of, so when I picked this up i wasnt expecting that much out of it. Needless to say I was mildy surprised, the story is kinda cliched but the fantastic artwork pretty much makes up for that,all in all a great little graphic novel.pick it up if you want something fun to read during math class, just dont expect anything too revolutionaryp.s I would have given it 3.5 if I could have"
4,Making Daily Life an Art,"This book is quite an enjoyable read. Throughout it are bits of travel writing, memoir, and biography, where Kimmelman relates artistic notions to daily life. His prose is witty and clear, so that one focuses more on the meaning than on complicated language. The chapters are divided into separate anecdotal topics, with such fascinating titles as, ""The Art of Collecting Lightbulbs"" and ""The Art of Finding Yourself When You're Lost"". Like most books, however, there are slower moments, such as ""The Art of the Pilgrimage"" chapter. I just skimmed through it and moved on to other sections that held more meaning for me. Overall, this book is one that I will reread. I look forward to discovering further insight from it, and in the meantime will work to apply some of its premise to my own life."
2,the accidental book,"While I enjoyed some of the stories in this book, I couldn't really follow a coherent thread here. This book seemed a kind of fun and loose ramble through some of the authors musings on what is art. But it was way too loose for me and I can't say I came away from reading it with any really new thoughts or perspectives on what makes an 'Accidental Masterpiece' aside from the eccentric conviction of the creator. A mildly interesting perspective, but not exactly fresh or new or terribly insightful."
4,The Accidental Masterpiece,"This book is a light read and enjoyable. The author, Michael Kimmelman weaves his life into experiences that helps explain how art and life are related. He shares interesting stories about artists' lives and keeps the reader interested. It isn't the best book if you are looking for deep theories on art, because he mainly tells stories and relates them to art topics. This book can appeal to almost all audiences even to people that are unlearned in the arts. Some parts seemed to drag on a bit, but overall it is an upbeat, interesting read."
4,excellent anecdotal reviews,"Very fun reading, and he touches on some of the big guns in art today, ones that are often difficult to describe, much less review critically. Kimmelman has a smooth, scholarly manner making his work accessible and insightful. If you're looking for rigorous analytical parsing of contemporary art, this is not your destination."
3,it is what it is,"the book is the book that I ordered. Nice soft copy, good condition and packaging was good.Can't say much about the book, bought it for an english turned art class (wtf i know) and haven't ever read it as thats just not something you do in college.The book itself is perfection, thus I rated it 3 stars, it is EXACTLY what IT is."
2,environmentally friendly art,"I thought the book was sometimes engaging with a number of interesting perspectives and anecdotes. But the ""Art of the Pilgrimage"" chapter was not constructive. The author seemed to completely ignore the environmental impact of some ""environmental art."" He raves about creating ""lush green pastures"" without considering the negative impact of such excessive consumption on deserts and other fragile habitats. I was especially offended by his assertion that art is better appreciated by traveling as much as possible - actually art and life are better appreciated by cultivating a responsible attitude toward consumption and environmental impact. It made me appreciate Manet even more: 'A painter can say all he wants to with fruit or flowers or even clouds . . . .'"
1,Why so EXPENSIVE? Way too much $$$!,"This (incomplete) set is an example of how these GREEDY companies are running AMOK with their stratospheric pricing. Not only for the 'I Love Lucy' set, but most other 'boxed sets' that cost a small fortune ('The Sopranos' is another one). Yeah, I can hear some of you tell me that it costs money for these companies to produce the show, or remaster and 'clean up' the original tapes/films, etc., BUT the huge price they charge insures that not too many people will be able to purchase these sets in the first place. Then they wonder why so many people attempt to 'burn' their own copies! With boxed sets like this essentially targeted for the 'well to do', how can hardworking, average Joe's afford this?"
5,"i love lucy,(not missing)","Anyone reading these reviews, do your own research! I looked at all these and noticed almost all of them said that there is NO i love lucy season 6 isn't out. Well, look up on amazon, i love lucy season 6 and sure enough it is there, no it doesnt come in the boxed set, harry potter movies cam eout with boxed sets and all te movies arent out yet, theycame out with a boxed set before the okay to put out the final season of lucy....."
1,I Love Lucy DVD Set,"Why is season #6 missing from the set, as well as the Lucy/Desi Comedy Hours? Are they available for purchase separately? Many thanks, Kenn Barton-Jones"
5,One of the best jazz CDs ever...,Very few albums have I purchased that I continue to listen to regularly after a few years. This is one of them that I do continue to listen to - for 16+ years. Everybody I've played this album for loves it - it's made my Christmas shopping pretty easy. You can't go wrong with Joe and a couple beers!
4,Good book; easy to read,"The other reviewer was unfair to this book when he criticized it for a lack of references. The introduction clearly says, ""In the back of this book, in case you are interested in looking further into a study we cite, you will find references listed under chapter headings."" The last two-dozen pages of the book are references.Unlike every other book that touches on aromatherapy or essential oils, this one was written by a medical doctor. It is refreshing to read an aromatherapy book written with a degree of scientific skepticism. Also, I greatly enjoyed the chapters about Madagascar, its history, and its botany.Finally, this book doesn't engage in New Age jargon. Now that is truly refreshing!"
3,Great photos! Inaccurate information,"I'm a sucker for pretty pictures, and this baby's chock-fulla 'em. Aside from the distracting neon pinks and blues, the identification was mostly correct. Some names were wrong, the prices are SERIOUSLY off, and it's missing a large portion of accessories.Pony prices are mainly determined by Ebay and what newbie collector is willing to blow on a beat-up Applejack--sure she's cute, but is she worth $20? Prices seemed fairly flat-rate in the book, and though helpful in bartering prices, they mostly just make the antique/resell collectors all googly-eyed and claim that their chewed up 2nd issue Cotton Candy is worth $15 because she's 'collectable'.And yet I still adore the pretty pictures."
1,Could have gotten better info off internet,Not a fan of this book. I find it to be pretty incomplete... I read it a while ago so maybe I wasn't paying enough attention. All in all I'd say don't waste your money and find info for free off the internet. - keatonj.
1,Online Sites are better!,"For a beginner to pony collecting this book is a great start. However, the more you learn about ponies, the more you realise that increasing numbers of facts in this book are wrong. The pictures are nice to look at, but are not the best quality.Hopefully a better book will come along!"
5,Worth the wait!,"This book was a great addition to the My Little Pony collecting community. I couldn't be more pleased with it! The photos are large and clear, and all of the info a new collector could use is here. It seems like we were forever without a guide book, and we have one at last! It was well worth the wait."
5,Great Pony Book,Wonderful book and Large in Size! Contains wonderful Color photography! My Little Pony Collecting is growing and its amazing how many toys there are made from these little horses! Can you believe that this isnt even HALF of what My Little Pony has to offer? Wow! Book also contains information on identifying ponies with photographs and Ponies Specific names all INDEXED. Also tips on What is NOT a My Little Pony. The only thing off is the price guide in some aspects. But with the growing trend in Pony Collecting and Auction sites prices will continue to rise! Good Job Debra!
1,Very Bad book,"Application Servers is pretty hot in the market and I thought this book would give a good architectural and design view as to how eCommerce Applications should be developed. Turned out to be utter diappointment. Looks like elementary book talking abc's about database,classes/objects, applets, beans, odbc/jdbc. Never ever by mistake buy it...."
1,Lacks the big picture view,"This book does not convey the ""big picture view"".The book goes through several chapters exposing details of technologies and standards surrounding Application Servers and the Web overall. I didn't find any glaring mistakes in those explanations per se. But then the author completely misses the opportunity to put the details into perspective and tie them together in a coherent whole.Also there are no clear lists or guidelines as to what features to look for in an Application server and how to narrow the choices and pick one from the huge list of offerings.I can not agree more with the first reviewers comments here about the section (#4) titled 'Maintainence'. Seems like a complete filler.Who knows, maybe the Author did have something to say but maybe the publishers rushed this book to print before he could pin it down and refine it."
3,"""Live"" concert recordings","I leave the dissection of the performances here to others (I find them on the academic side). What is not mentioned on the listing or CD package is that these recordings were made in front of a concert audience. While the audience is generally unintrusive, it still should have been stated somewhere."
2,A luke-warm recording,"Of the several recording I have for the Beethoven concertos, this simply sits on my shelf. I return to it on odd occasions simply in an attempt to understand its appeal, but this still escapes me. Although technically acceptable, I find all of the performances rather dull.I would not recommend this as a first purchase of Beethoven's piano concertos for anyone. Although it is probably a good idea to get all 5 concerti(all are indispensable), I would start with any of Wilhelm Kempf's recordings. Also well worth the money are Murray Perahia's recordings, though he tends to take them all at a faster pace than I would prefer."
5,It's great product,It's great great. You should take this tablets before any medical or dental procedure. It reduce the swelling and preventing bruises
5,Good Historical Romance and Prose Perfection!,"This is my first time to read Barbara Samuel, but it certainly won't be the last. I would say that The Black Angel is probably the best historical romance of 1999. The writer's prose is clean, but lyrical, and this romance is about grown-ups. Nothing silly here. I especially enjoyed that her characters were flawed, that the romance was one of passion and longing, and that Ms. Samuel added secondary characters of deep feelings. Don't miss this book. It's a wonderful read that you will enjoy over and over again.Highly recommended."
3,A worthwhile read...(3 1/2 stars),"""Black Angel"" was a good book. I enjoyed it, but didnt love it. I found that I couldnt quite connect with the characters. I did enjoy Tynan..and Adriana wasnt awful, but I thought that they could have been a bit more fleshed out. I also felt that the ending was rushed..I wanted more. A worthwhile read, but not one that is a keeper for me."
2,Black Angel -- literary history askew here,"I just finished The Black Angel. I would give it two stars. The story could have been so much better if Samuels had not used it as a prop to espouse the ideals of womanhood as seen through the eyes of 21st century women. My biggest complaint has to do to the references in the book to the characters and sayings embodied by The Three Musketeers. The setting for Black Angel clearly takes place in 1786. The Three Musketeers was not even written until 1844! Methinks the author and/or her editor had their literary knowledge plainly askew. Unforgivable to my way of thinking. As to the fact that it reads like a potential series, I agree. I think I read somewhere that she intended it to be a series but her publisher threw up a roadblock to her; that she got her rights back and intends to go on and self-publish through Amazon. I have one more out of three to read of her books that I downloaded. I hope the third one (set in medieval times) is better. Otherwise..."
3,Not the entertaining kind of read.,"I have to agree with another critic and say I didn't like all the tangents the story went on--feminism, racism, relgious freedom."
2,BORING!,I had a hard time finishing the book. The only reason that prevented me from ditching it was the money I paid for it.Very little intrigue and very poorly written.
5,The Black Angel,"OUTSTANDING! Beautifully written. Great research. The story line had it ALL & wonderfully woven together. I could not put it down! I will put it on my ""To read again"" list. I don't often recommend books, but highly recommend this one. I look forward to next book in this series. Thank you, Ms Samuels. This was one of the best books I've read this year. Reviewer:Barbara Boyle/Calif."
3,Where was The Black Angel?,"Sorry, but my disappointment in this book had to do with a poor definition of the hero. How did he get his reputation? I kept waiting to see the man behind the reputation--and all I saw was a strong heroine, with a weak hero. She showed more of a rakish personality than he did! Also didn't like all the tangents the story went on--feminism, racism, relgious freedom. One theme would have been plenty. Why did I give it 3 stars. Barbara Samuel's writing skills do shine thru!"
4,Lady finds herself betrothed to notorious rake.,"Lady Adriana St. Ives had blotted her copy book with a scandalous affair with the illegitimate son of a Duke. In defense of her honor her brother had killed the sod in a duel and was forced to leave England to escape hanging. Several years pass, and Adriana is orphaned and finds herself betrothed by her deceased father to an ambitious Irishman known as 'the Black Angel,' Tynan Spenser, Earl of Glencove. Tynan wants to use the St. Ives name to further his plans to aid his people. He is surprised when Adriana's brother shows up after the wedding. Barbara Samuel's The Black Angel is a spirited interplay of romance and dramatic adventure. An innocent young woman's folly leads to exile, and a marriage will bring her family home to face a trial. A marriage of convenience proves to be inconvenient as each must learn their hearts needs. Romance par excellence."
5,A wonderful surprise!,"I didn't know the writer and the book was free so my expectations weren't great but what a wonderful surprise I had! This is a romance but the heroine is not exactly like so many that you find in other books. She is fierce and sometimes acts impulsively but the difference here is that she thinks in a way way ahead of her time. Not to do stupid things but things that are really important to her as a person, to grow as a person. The storyline is great and I loved the way it is told. So I think it is a great book worth reading and keeping."
1,Terrible...,"I'm a huge fan of splatter movies. I can't see why a renowned movie reviewer like joe bob briggs would say this movie is a ""97 on the vomit meter."" The ""gory"" parts of this film are all up close shots of the 'cannibals' eating their victims, meaning you can't see the victims face when they are being eaten, which therefore makes it look like the cannibals aren't even eating a person, but just horribly fake looking entrails. All of the scenes containing the alleged cannibals eating victims are shot as close ups of the cannibals' face in slow-mo. The slow-mo scenes are so overly done. Every slow-mo scene lasts longer than 2 minutes, and EVERY SINGLE MUNCHING SCENE IS IN SLOW-MO LIKE THIS!I can't say I expected much from the dubbing, but I guess I don't understand how the cannibals, whom speak a language other than English, can speak English...AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! This movie is pure filth. If you want a GOOD cannibal movie, check out Cannibal Holocaust (that's a given) or Anthropophagus."
1,GARBAGE,"this movie is such garbage, the cannibals were so stupid looking (best i can think of at the moment). i have lots of faults with this movie but being a big fan of cannibal movies one thing i find really anoying is the fact that the cannibals (who are humans, not zombies) are eating there victims raw. trash pure trash."
5,Nice...,"I had to return this item, but it is still getting 5 stars from me!It was returned because I meant to order the ""Hammered Copper with Black Accessories"" part number. The folks at Unbeatable Sales were very understanding and had no issues setting up a refund over the telephone. They didn't have the part number I wanted, so I ended up having to order the same item from a different store to get the right color.It is definitely a quality product and the customer service was excellent. I put up my own customer image to hopefully save some people from making the same mistake in the future and so people can see what the finish actually looks like."
2,cheap is what you get,"this could have been a good product if it wasn't so flimsily made. the velcro piece that sticks to the window to hold the bottom of the shade down fell right off of my clean window, and the suction cups don't stay very long, either. the hole in the bottom tab to attach to the suction cup is too big and slips off the cup. the clip on the top that hooks over the top of the window broke apart on the second day of use. on the plus side, the roll-up action is good and the overall look is nicer than some other shades. it shades somewhat...i wish it were more opaque, though. overall, it's a cheap product that doesn't seem to stand up well to its intended usage."
3,Get what you pay for,"Cheaply made but that's to be expected based on the price. Fine for occasional trips but not the best choice for daily use. Our 8 year old daughter broke the retracting mechanism the first time she pulled the shade down. We bought two of these for a long trip and they did the job, other than the fact we had to leave the broken one down the entire time."
1,not worth it!,"Don't get this product, get the cling on kind. Our hospital told us not to use it and I agree... it is cheap and can fall off if using the suction cups and may hit your baby if it falls (which is what the hospital said can happen). We got the cling on kind and it stays on and covers a bigger space on the window too."
2,To small,"Doesn't cover the entire window. useless :(I like the way it work (up/down), but absolutely useless. Will have to get new wider shades."
4,Great shade.,This is a great little shade. You have two options for attaching it and we chose the suction cups. Easy to pull down and a breeze to retract. The shade itself is sturdy and provides good shade.
2,fragile,Ordered two of these. One of them broke as soon as I opended it. Put the parts back together and is working but auto rewind is not working. SO I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. Keep yourself away from this product.
2,Zombie,"This book was full of darkness with no hope or redemption. I kept reading it because I thought ""there has to be a ray of hope somewhere"", but there never was. I'm sorry I read it and actually deleted it from my Kindle."
2,Zombie a gruesome read,"I've always liked Oates and have read most of her work, often based on real crimes. I'm not sure if this one is, butit is certainly a bit over the top gruesome. Couldn't finish it."
2,Won't Try a Third Date,"Many years ago I read a novel by Joyce Carol Oates which left me empty, unsatisfied. Having a couple decades of years under my belt since then, I decided to try a more current story. Sorry, but the book just left me dissatisfied. In my opinion, a very disappointing ending to this disturbing novel killed it for me."
2,Too real,Well written but so realistic. Too close a view of psychosis for me. I imagine killers think and act just this way. Very scary and depressing.
3,Penetrating Story; Writing Just OK......,"This is the story of a mad, perverted mind. It's not a pleasurable read because of the story itself, but it's made marginally more unpleasant by the author's writing style. Quentin is a deranged, extraordinarily antisocial young gay man, who's main desire in life is to have his own 'zombie'. Much of his time is spent planning 'ground zero', how he'll capture his potential 'zombie', and how life will be with his 'zombie' catering to his every physical and emotional need, no matter how gruesome they may be.Told in a less rambling way, without the use of '&' to start every other sentence, I think the story might have been more a more palatable read. I'm sure the author was trying to portray Quentin's unbalanced mind, but in the process she kept this reader well off-balance with the way she had him think out loud for us.Anyway, not to take anything away from the author's bravery in writing such a novel, I just didn't like her style."
3,Zombie,"Sick, sick, very sick! Unfortunately all too true I believe. I enjoy crime stories and read many. This one gave me a bad case of creeps. I wonder how many walk among us undetected?"
4,Creepy,"Joyce Carol Oates certainly writes some interesting, unusual, and bizarre books. Macabre and violent look into the mind of a psychopath."
4,very well written,"I am a Oats fan. I started this book but have taken a break. I hve worked in Mental health for 35 years. Tis was a little too real for me. Some brutality that is hard to swallow. However as I have spent hours talking with people who suffer from scizophrenia and Bi-polar disorder with psychotic features I find her depiction of the thinking of the protaganist perfect. I am not saying that this type of behavior is common with psychotic people, however her ability to articulate that which few have ever heard, was beautyful. The emotional life and disconect of this man was spot on. I will finish it over the next month, just need a break."
2,Eewww,"If you want to truly get in the head of a sexual serial killer, this disturbing book will do it. Very graphic in his homosexuality and psychopathic thought processes. I really now wonder at the writers mental state. I was embarressed to be reading it and now wish I had not."
2,Odd story,"The upside: Joyce Carol Oates is a great writer who can spin a tale. Unfortunately this is one tale I wish she had kept to herself. Made me uncomfortable, odd, and felt like I had no one to 'root"" for in this tale."
3,Oates Brings Lobotomies Back in Style,"This book made me shiver. It's more of a character sketch than a novel, but worth reading. Joyce Carol Oates has an unmatched gift for the nightmare-inducing.You can find my full-length book reviews at litbeetle.com."
1,"Pointless, but disturbing","Just finished this book and still trying to figure it out. It doesn't seem to have a purpose, a point, or a storyline. I haven't read anything else by this author, but if this is representative of her writing, I'm not inspired or interested in exploring her other works. Hardly worth the $1.99, and I'd be embarrassed to check it out of my local public library."
2,Zombie,Not one of her better efforts I would not recommend this book. She has written things that I loved but this was not one of them.
1,This book is disqusting,I found no plot only a great deal of smut. I was not even able to finish the book. It needs a XXX rating.
3,A strange one from Oates.,"zombie........ Not at all what I expected from J C Oates, but intriguing ayway. It s certainly worth reading, if only to see what Oates can do."
4,portrait of a monster,"what i found in this book was a style andcharisma all its own. although the random grammar and odd punctuationtake some getting used to, i believe it only helps to achieve an ideal setting in the mind of a disturbed man. those who have reviwed before me speak of lack of depth in the main character. i feel that the way in which the serial killer is allowed to narrate his own twisted tale is essential to highlighting the truly depraved and void of feeling nature that he posesses. i dont think that this book is meant to target stereotypes or promote perverted acts of desperation. it serves only to introduce one to an innovative way of telling a story. in reference to another review i read, i believe that it is stereotypical in itself to assme that all criminal minds are calculated and complex. i found this book entertaining. recommended if you can stomach the often graphic violence. indeed worthwhile."
5,A book worth reading,"QP has a dream. He hopes someday to create a wholly loving and giving sex slave by means of an amateur lobotomy. In pursuit of his dream he has his frustrations, but he cherishes a little something from each effort.Perhaps just enough genetic and environmental factors are presented to make understood the behaviour of one of natures' more extreme cases.It makes me think about the difference between the natural behaviour of animals or planetary bodies and what is considered human behaviour. Perhaps Ms. Oates reconciles these matters for herself by her art, rendering unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's."
1,Horrible,"I have read Oates before and was impressed by her book 'We Were the Mulvaneys'. But, after reading `Zombie', I will never read or recommend this author again. The subject matter was basically a man getting sexually excited (too many times to count) by thinking about and/or torturing vulnerable young men. This book was disgusting and definitely not worth my time. Unfortunately, I always finish reading a book I have started to give it a fair chance. Not a good choice with this Oates book. There was never a redeeming quality found. I can't fathom why anyone would give this book a 5 star rating. Horrible. UPDATE: I didn't realize this book was about a real-life serial killer; hence the dark, insane prose. However, it wasn't clear when I purchased it. I would have steered clear of this one."
1,This book makes me feel stupid,"I do not understand why so many people think this book is brilliant. Some of the concepts were interesting, but the style made reading a chore. Maybe I am missing something, but I felt I was reading a cheap novelization of a z-grade 'Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer' knock off."
1,What a complete waste of time,"Terrible book -- a waste of time and money -- no start or finsh --no character development and certainly no depthWhat did I miss here? I cannot believe that anyone thinks that this is worth readingAnd ... It didn't have any if the ""scary"" that so many people ascribed to itBad bad bad"
1,Just plain bad,"I have nothing positive to say about this Oats novel. I have enjoyed JCO in the past and this description captivated me. I did not like it from a story telling perspective, from a character development perspective or from the content. Forgive me for not getting too specific - I don't even want to re-think about the story."
2,"Hmmm. Did boxing, now what? I know--serial killers!","This is literary slumming. Not enlightening, not demanding, not scary, not particularly inventive. As usual, thorough research yields accurate depictions of therapies, procedures, aberrant psychology. But to what end? Bigshot author puts in two cents on serial killer phenemon. Recommend pass."
2,Title as cynical selling tool for yet more JCO literary gutter slime,"This came up in a zombie search and how cynical is that? What possible relevance does this title have to the subject matter?That aside, this is literary darling JCO at her most repulsive, depressing, life-denying best. Considering suicide? This will push you over the edge."
1,Zombie is what the reader becomes,"This book is CRAP. WOODEN characters. NOT the mind of a serial killer but the ramblings of a BAD writer. So much is lacking from regarding research, insight, style, writing, consistency that it's not even worth mentioning. Dutton got ROYALLY snookered on this one. Joyce can write two novels a year, but if they are this bad, she should be writing TEN novels a year. DON'T bother."
5,JCO - Great as always,JCO has the ability to create characters that are real and unbelievable at the same time. Zombie is a stellar example of that talent. The evil she taps into in this book is unlike any other and I highly recommend it.
4,Creepy,This is a an unusual look inside the mind of a psycopath/serial killer. It is a real page turner and and gets your mind thinking in very disturbing ways.
2,Zombie,"Love her writing, but this was just too strange, too sickening, too depressing. I could not finish it. Such a talented writer, why this? So this taught me to check out more than the author when buying. I know the title should have been enough for me to know this wouldn't be for me, but I gave in to the author and the low price."
1,WORST BOOK EVER,"This is absolutely the worst book I've ever read. The writing is horrible -- not a journal exactly, but horrible sentence structure. Example (done from memory): ""Mom asked how I was and I said."" Truly, that is the end of the sentence. Never tells what he said. This is done over and over. The word ""and"" does not appear in the book, even when it's the first word of the sentence it's replaced with &.On top of the horrible writing, the story itself is ridiculous. I generally enjoy books about the inside mind of a criminal, but this has no socially redeeming value whatsoever. If you are into macabre sex, bad writing and lots of superfluous cussing, then read this book. Otherwise, skip this one."
2,Zombie,"I read a lot and this is the strangest book I have ever read. I make it a point to finish every book I start, but doing so with this was a real challenge. I am not sure the point, other than to alert us all that there are monsters among us-- which most of us already know all too well."
4,Great read!,"This was one of the best ive read, very bizzare but fun and exciting. It is hard to put down once you have started it! Joyce Carol Oates has a disturbing imagination but is creative and suspensful all the same. I have read quite of few of her other novels, and much like the others, this one had me from the first few paragraphs and i was hooked!"
1,A young man with a mission to make a zombie for himself,I did not like this book. Not because of the content but because he did not get what was coming to him in the end. He needed to get caught and go to prison at the very least but Joyce Carol Oats lets him get away with his crimes and just go on going on.
2,"Well written, but scary!","The author did a great job of portraying the main character to be a sick, twisted murderer. But the plot and the ending left a big hole in the pit of my stomach."
4,Not for Zombie lovers.,"I was hesitant to read this because I do NOT enjoy zombie stories. However, I think Oates should have picked a different title. As usual, Oates is an excellent writer."
3,Format,I'm afraid I don't have the patience to deal with the requirement for the click to open each chapter format. One of the things I love about reading with the Kindle is the ability to leave a book in the middle and pop right back a day or a week later in the exact same spot in the book. I might go back to this book again to actually finish...if I can remember where I left off...
3,Leaves you feeling ugly,"Like many of other Oates' books, she gets to the heart of human ugliness and horror, and leaves you feeling as though you could understand, if not be there yourself one day. The main character, Quentin P___, is not exceptionally intelligent, but manages to get through everyday life appearing quite normal while his thoughts are disturbing, feverish obsessions of creating a perfect sex toy - a ""zombie"" that will service him as desired. This one's hard to get out of your mind after you read it."
2,Word of Warning,"I had to get rid of this book when my son was born. I wouldn't want him being exposed to the things done in this book. For the same reason, I got rid of ""Let the Right One In,"" but I enjoyed that book a little more than ""Zombie."" I think the character was well crafted, and the writing was excellent. However, I didn't like this book. It was horrific, graphic, and disturbing. If that is what you are looking for, you will probably enjoy this book."
2,Couldn't finish,"Even if it was Joyce Carol Oates. Although I have to admire her taking on the subject matter, but I just can't do creepy weird like this."
1,What the?!?,"I usually pass along books to my sisters that I finish reading. Often horror, and the more horrific the better.I literally threw this book in the trash when I disappointedly finished reading. I couldn't bear to pass it along and have another person endure what I did. It was horrific enough, but it was also a horrific read, and a waste of time. If you've purchased this book, I suggest throwing it away before you start."
2,Not at all what I expected.,"This was a completely disturbing read. I walked away from the book feeling like I just watched the film Sid & Nancy.... where the characters are so distasteful, you don't care what happens to them.The lead character in this book is SO far detached from reality, and any human emotion....or rather, ANY emotion..The author wrote a very dry, detailed ""diary"" of a human emotional void. A stain on society...from the point of view of the sicko. I wasn't comfortable being inside the head of someone as sick as this character. A character with no compassion... no sorrow... no regret.. no reason.By biggest complaint is that the book didn't flow.... probably because it was coming ""from"" the view of the disturbed lead character. It was a very choppy read. ugly. Technical."
4,Suprised,This was not the type of book I expected from Joyce Carol Oates. It is a very dark tale. A 30 somthing gay male is seeking love and unquestioned devotion and thinks a zombie would meet this standard. Since there aren't too many zombies available he tries to create his own.
5,Oates at her best,"Though this is an older work by Joyce Carol Oates, I had not read it before, but once I started, could not put it down. It was bone chilling in a very understated way, Oates at one of her best. You won't be disappointed."
4,Nightmaric. Simply Nightmaric!,"I came across this one a few (well more than a few) years ago while I was working in a public library. I read the back cover and thought ""Oh, no Joyce! Not another story about rape/murder!"" But Zombie caries an intriging twist...It deals with psychology. The mental malfunction of a madman. And how (sadly) so many criminals can fall through the cracks and meander through society...only to hurt others again.We get a horrifying look into the mentality of Quentin P. A sociopath who preys upon young boys. We get to hear him ramble and rant, gloat whenever he thinks he has others fooled.It's truly disturbing...even anger evoking in parts.Definitely better than Rape: A love story."
2,Eerie but predictably so,"These days, when picking up any novel tracing the exploits of a serial killer, one immediatetly assumes three things: 1) the killer is male; 2) the killer's sexuality is muddled in light of society's standards; 3) the novel itself is bloody. Oates' ZOMBIE lives up to all three expectations. While there are some classic, excrutiating moments in the text--quite enjoyable to read--the novel itself does not live up to literary standards in the least (or to the standards Oates' has set for herself in previous novels). I only wish she had developed some of the novel's themes a little better, and without being so obvious. At the same time, though, there are many pleasurable passages throughout; the book itself will not bore you. Just don't expect this novel to differ greatly from any biography of Jeffry Daumer."
1,Don't bother,A thouroughly disappointing work by Joyce Carol Oates. I was at first disappointed at the fact it was so short (hardly a novel at all) but at the end regarded its brevity as a blessing. Only the most shallow depths of emotion are examined in this tale of the mind of a serial killer - a news paper story provides as much. For a similar first person account of a disturbed mind check out Butcher Boy by Pat McCabe
1,Zombies Review,She is my favorite author. This book was definitely not up to her standards. I did not like this book at all!!
2,I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,"This book was quick to read and well-written. However, the content was disturbing. Some of the more unpleasant passages in the book stuck with me and I found myself thinking of them at work which wasn't awesome since the scenes were so hideous and depressing. I didn't want to keep reading it. The only reason I read it was to see how it ended. The ending was abrupt and disappointing to say the least. I couldn't recommend this to anyone because it's just depressing and not particularly entertaining."
2,Great read--for zombies and psychotics,"As an artistic expression of the psychotic mind, Oates is successful. As a literary endeavor, I'm dissapointed. The ending definitely leaves the reader wanting some sort of justice. The sexual sadism is purely gratuitous and voyeristic.My recommendation? Rent Dexter."
2,No American Psycho,"I wanted to be in the mind of a serial killer, rather found myself inside the mind of some cereal filler. I might have liked this book in high school but as an adult I want my zombie killing homosexual murdering individual(s) to be a little deeper than some nitwit with an ice pick."
4,Disturbingly realistic,"Once again, JCO has managed to get inside the head of a fictional character to such an extend that it is haunting. Just TRY to put this book down!"
1,Waste of Time,Zombie is a complete waste of time! This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I bought Zombie based on Joyce Carol Oates' reputation and previous books of hers that I have read. She must have decided to experiment with a new genre of literature. There are just too many great books out there to read-why waste your time reading this junk.
1,Weird format..very difficult to read.,"This book was very difficult to read. It's told from the perspective of a very broken psyche and the author tries to get that point across by writing in fragments. It literally gave me a headache trying to follow it. The subject matter is dark and the descriptions gory..which would normally hold my attention but the story has no structure, no real beginning or ending and leaves you feeling frustrated."
5,Addicting - One of a kind!,"This was the first book I picked up by Joyce Carol Oates. At first I was disturbed by it, but that's what fascinated me. I couldn't put it down, I looked forward to going home just so I could read it and now I recommend it to my friends. Oates accomplished exactly what she meant to. Whoever says it wasn't deep, doesn't really know what ""deep"" is, you have to be ""deep"" to write the way Oates has here. Zombie is terrifying, disturbing - a book about a serial killer nobody else could have duplicated. After reading this book, I am addicted to Joyce Carol Oates. Her work is fantastic!"
1,Boil Your Eyes,"Joyce Carol Oates is the author and I thought, ""She's a well-respected writer in the American literary scene and I've never read anything of hers before, so I'll give this a shot."" This is not for people with delicate (or any) sensibilities. The one positive thing I can say is that it's amazing how a nice (I'm assuming) little lady can put herself into the character of a pedophile/necrophiliac with no redeeming qualities. But I think she wasted her gifts with this work. I don't know who her target audience was for this, but it's not me."
4,One of the scariest books I have read...,"I don't want to say I loved this book because it terrified me, it was that good. It is hard for me to even find the words to describe it. I felt like I read the whole book with my eyeballs wide open large as saucers wondering if I wanted to know what would happen next - but of course I did want to know even if I knew it would be bad. It is real world scary, this guy could live next door to me or you or anyone."
3,Zombie,"I couldn't put it down but did not like the way the author ended the story. It was if I did not get the whole book on my Kindle. It came to an abrupt end. I guess her idea was, you put your own ending to the story."
3,Interesting,Definitely an interesting read. Not exactly what I expected. Parts can be very dark and creepy! But I like creepy things like that so I didn't mind.
4,Too perverted for me,If I had known how brutal and perverted this book is I would not have ordered it. I think you should give potential readers some warning about the nature of the book so they can decide if it is something they wish to read.The writing was well done however and I'm sure some readers liked it.
3,"Good, but not her best.","Anything by Oates is better than most anything by anyone else. I prefer her full length novels, but for a short story, I enjoyed it. Would recommend it to any fan of JCO."
5,He knew them all!,"If you're looking for a poignant, brilliant, funny, and deeply moving memoir, the Tall Boy is must-read material. Jess Gregg's language is polished to high finish, each story is a jewel! Jess Gregg knew so many fascinating people, and as he reveals the famous and the infamous, he also reveals himself."
4,looks like the stock one,"it looks just like the stock one - same shape and writing on top. it does fit a lot better that the older one, probably because its new."
4,Good pump for the money,"The RIO HF series of pumps is an excellent value. I just replaced my old RIO 20HF with a new one after several years of faithful service. They run quietly, have low energy consumption and can push a large volume of water.Sure there are better pumps, but those are going to cost you quite a bit more money. It is really hard to beat the value of these pumps especially considering the amount of use I got out of them.My only real negative is that these pumps do seem to give off quite a bit of heat into the water. I don't have anything to compare this against though.Overall, I have been very pleased with all the RIO pumps that I have owned."
4,matress protector,I really like how the matress protector fits. easy to put on and they weight of the product is just right.
4,AWSOME,"I had recently purchased this about a year ago and and after a couple shoots my lighbulb in the gun died. I waited a year and got as a birthday present and it still hasn't broke. I love playing with it, however there is only 3 targets. Still it's better than the ferris wheelone you'll spend hours blowing up the ballons!"
2,Cute for a few minutes,"I thought this would be a great item to have for playing with my grandchildren. I set it up to test it and although it works just like it says it does, after about 30 seconds, the targets have been triggered and the bottles are on the table. No challenge at all. You aim the gun light at 3 spots and the hat falls off, the bottles fall, then you put them up again (that is a challange since they don't stay up well), and try it again. NO misses, since the light is easy to line up. Would not buy it for a gift item."
2,Too frustrating,"It's a shame because this game has such a cute and fun concept....However, the little plastic jugs and mugs cut in half, so to speak, and they are almost impossible to set up. They fall off of the little shelf and it's frustrating for the children even before they start the game. I think it's even more frustrating for me. I would never buy this for anyone as a gift. Actually, as I'm typing this I can hear my son saying ""Aaghhh"" as he's trying to set it up. Sounds like it's screaming 'donation box' to me!"
5,Great Poster! It's Perfect.,The Poster was in perfect condition and I got exactly what I paid for. Totally worth it.
1,"A dearth of information, complete antithesis of fundamental manhattan GMAT","I purchased the two verbal books produced by mgmat. The company boasts about going beyond mere gimmicks and teaching a concrete basis for best test results. While the sentence correction is unbelievably lucid and thorough, the reading comp/critical reasoning is the polar opposite. It is nothing more than a fragmented regurgitation of the princeton review's far superior attempt at teaching rc/cr. Avoid this manual, but do pickup the mgmat sentence correction guide."
1,NOT practical enough,In general do not buy any of the seven series of books offered from MANHATTAN... they are not worth the buck.There is too much hype associated and it does not deliver to its expectations Tips in this book are outdated as can be seen from the other reviews as well. Save money and save time.
4,Another good read,I read this book after reading the author's first book Shadowmancer. Wormwood is another great trip into fantasyland. Even better than Shadowmancer. The fight against good and evil. I didn't expect it to be on the same level as Tolkien's books but it is still an exciting and gripping tale for most children and adults who enjoy this kind of book and can handle a few Bible verse without freaking out about being preached to.
5,A live performance not to be missed!,"Ward Kimball's stage patter is second only to the band's rippin' tunes. If you are more of a Disney fan than a Dixieland fan, this disc will have you hooked on their upbeat, fun-loving style of play. Who ever thought a band made up of Disney artists could play so well? Thanks for all the musical memories, boys!"
5,a worthwhile investment,This book should be a resouce in every PACU across the USA. It is helpful for preparation for the CPAN exam and as a refresher. I would recommend this book.
3,Review of Textbook,This book is outdated and copyright is 1994. I would reccomend using a more updated textbook to study for the CAPA exam.
2,PeriAnesthesia Nursing: A Critical Care Approach,"I purchased this book for review to take my CAPA exam. I have taken the exam before but let it expire. I have worked PACU before but mostly Preop, Phase 2 now. Honestly, I felt the book was a little over the top. Too detailed about every little system. Like who wants to go over the Krebs cycle again ugh! I had to skim over many parts to try to extract the important stuff. The test is multiple choice and usually asks questions so that you can use your nursing process in regards to pt care. I am not a Critical Care Nurse maybe thats why I found it laborias. However,If I were taking CPAN then maybe it would be more beneficial. I wouldn't recommend this book honestly. I wish someone would just come out with a book that says ""CAPA STUDY GUIDE"" to take the guess work out. Thanks."
1,Scammer seller,This guy claimed to ship via media mail. I am not sure anything takes this long to get sent by mail.Unless they are using Pony Express. This guy is a scammer and a rip off artist. Dont trust a deadbeat seller like him
4,well worth the money,This really is a great little mp3 player. I had one of these for when I worked outside and I loved it. The sound quality was great. It takes a triple A battery which gives you 6 to 7 hours of music. The only real drawback is the directions. They suck!! However if you go to there site and you stay with it you will figure it out. Once you do that the mp3 player is a whiz to operate and you can't go wrong for the money. Mine was stolen but I'm fixing to buy another.
1,One Huge Flaw,"This really isn't bad for $30. However, it has one major flaw: it continually stops while playing. This is not caused by accidentally hitting the power button (if you use the 'lock' feature, deliberately hitting the power button won't work until you unlock). This is not caused by playing protected MP3s. It seems to be worse in the cold and when it's first started, and jiggling the thing seems to be the trigger.On the other hand, it's $30, and if you mostly plan to use it while sitting still, it's adequate. I didn't find it particularly difficult to use (it worked well with my MusicMatch software). However, having bought it as a cheap 'just to get me by' player, I've become fed-up with the stopping and I'm buying a different player."
4,Good product at cheaper price,I like this MP3 as it is easy to load music and play. The quality of sound is also good. However it takes me few days to understand choosing different music folder to play the music. Hence it would be better if manufacturer can provide more details in catalog for the easiness of users.
5,An invaluable aid to the art of dissertation creation,The Art of Scientific Innovation by Professor Syed V Ahamed and Dr Victor Lawrence is a contribution to graduate education not readily found in other scientific text material. What the authors have done is to share their personal experience with guiding Ph.D. students in graduate dissertation work. They elicit the essential ingredients of performing seminal contributions to the field of endeavor. They have created a stream of outstanding flow of scientific creativity by researchers who have made some of the largest contributions to the art of scientific innovation. This report of these contributions combined with their personal analysis of the dissertation process make this a work that should be read by all Ph.D students.
1,why i don't trust reviews,"i purchased this book largely on the quality of the amazon reviews it received...what a mistakethe book isn't bad,,,it's just not good...it is particularly useless for anyone who is serious about scientific innovation and innovation in science...any grad school student or doctoral candidate who thinks this a genuinely helpful book is probably a below-the-median phd candidate...any professor who would make this a chosen text is - i'm sorry - either lazy or not very confident in their students' energies and/or talents...i would have given this book two stars but it's been so horribly overrated that balance is essential...if you have no clue - or merely a tiny one - get this book from a library...if you are seriously interested in science-based innovation, please...spare yourselflearn from my error"
4,"Ken Ishi, Extraordinaire Japanese DJ does it again",Seamless mixing by Ken Ishi only gets better with the combination of great smooth house music that was put together by X Recording. Ishi paints a world of elaborate sound-scapes as you are brought through worlds of adventure. The mixes are seamless and the great assortment of tracks will keep the feet moving. If you are a true house coinsurer you are sure to be pleased with this piece of work
3,"Good, but not what I expected.","I was looking for a Cat Scratch DVD and saw this. I did not realize it was a compilation of cartoons, however it had most of my favorites so all worked out OK."
3,"Rather faceless, flaccid readings of both works","This CD is now avilable as part of a bargain two-fer from EMI, but even then I'm not sure I would go for it. These two early works are among Shostakovich's most jaunty and sparkling. The piano concerto in particular exhibits not the slightest shadow. The First Sym. has more light and shade but still comes off best when its high spirits aren't tinted gray, while the slow music should create a somber counterpoint. Frankly, I find nothing at all lively in Jansons' conducting of either work. Despite the fabled Berlin Phil, the orchestral playing is routine, and Rudy makes very little of the solo piano part (Jansons recorded a dull Rachmaninov concerto cycle with him, also on EMI). Good sound throughout, and nothing less than impeccable execution.In all, this pairing is not a shining installment in Jansons' long traversal of the complete Shostakovich symphonies. There's a proficient, faceless quality that leaves me cold."
4,Great for the price,"I agree with the rest of the review, these aren't the best but they're pretty good for the price. The thickness isn't as consistent as other bully sticks I have bought, but these are half the price and last just as long. And with two dogs under a year these are crucial for the survival of any shoes/pillows of mine."
1,Huge disappointment,"This big heavy book was practically useless to me, a music teacher who teaches young children in Spanish. The vast majority of the rhymes and songs were originally English language, just translated into Spanish, with a handful of original Spanish ones translated into English. There was no clear index that distinguished the two types, and the book was so large that I was overwhelmed at the task of searching every page to ferret out the originals. And without the written music, how is anyone supposed to sing the songs? A waste of my time, money, and bookshelf space--I wouldn't even give this away."
4,"An ""America""-n star!","This is a good, not great album, though the I think it could be the most underrated--at least at the time--of all of the America albums. Some of the songs on this album, in my opinion, are great, and some just don't do it for me at all. It's kind of an all-or-nothing sort of thing. Hat Trick has something special to it in that it's really the very last album they made that doesn't have that sort of George Martin polish to it, a polish that remained in one form or other, even when Martin left the band around 1980. From their eponymous debut record until this one, America got more and more musically sophisticated. Not a bad thing, except that it doesn't automatically make for great songs. Great songs are: ""Wind Wave"", ""It's Life"", ""Rainbow Song"". Good songs: ""She's Gonna Let You Down"", and ""Goodbye"". The rest--and this is just me and my two cents--are really not very good."
4,Not America's Best Effort ...,"But nonetheless a pretty good piece of work as this includes some really good America tracks. This, their third album (hence the name ""Hat Trick"") is a must have for any true fan of the band. Vintage America."
3,America's Third Album Is A Disappointment To Me.,"America's self titled debut album is fantastic, follow up Homecoming, is not far behind, so I had high hopes for Hatrick.OK I already knew Muskrat Love is just about my least favourite America track, but somehow the whole album just dosen't seem to come to life.By far the best song is She's Gonna Let You Down, however all too much of the remainder seems to meander along.Green Monkey is OK, but overall it's 3 stars and that's pushing it.I recommend the first 2 albums, A Horse With No Name And Other Hits and the 1975 semi live A Horse With No Name recorded in Germany."
5,Quintessential America,"""Hat Trick"" is one of the least lauded of America's albums when it ought to be acclaimed as one of their best. Even I, an America fan for nearly 30 years, underrated ""Hat Trick"" until I rediscovered it on CD format this year. With a more mature taste than I had as a teen in the 70's, I can look back at tunes like Wind Wave, Rainbow Song, and Submarine Ladies and truly appreciate their diamond-in-the-rough brilliance. As much as I love the later pop hit You Can Do Magic and the ""View From The Ground"" album, that's a much more polished sound and is not the same America that was captured on ""Hat Trick"". There's a raw, youthful exuberance on this album that no amount of polish can replace. Possibly this is the quintessential America album."
1,Unsatisfied,submitted initial negative review requesting the seller to contact me via telephone. They still haven't contacted me to discuss their picture not seeming to be the same product I purchased. I stated that in my email where I requested a call but unfortunately I have not heard back from them.
3,"Okay, could be better. I love Dane Cook!","This DVD was Okay I thought it would be better. I love Dane Cook, but this is not his best work."
5,the lost pilots,dane cook has alot of originality behind his comedy.this dvd is no different.alot of funny moments throughout the film.a great addition to any collection
1,Oh dear GOD this is bad stuff...but funny because of it's badness.,Im a fan of things that are so bad you almost have to laugh...these pilots are bad...just plain bad bad bad. It is no wonder they didn't get picked up. I'm a HUGE Dane Cook fan for the most part and do enjoy most all of his work...this is work that you'd be better served not seeing. But I do suppose for hardcore Dane Cook fans you may as well get it...it's not going to break the bank or anything.
2,Lost indeed...,"Now I love love love Dane Cook, but even I was glad these were ""lost"" pilots. A must have for loyal Dane followers, but I'm pretty sure you'll only watch them once."
3,Good but not great,it was just good to see Dane in something else but i can see why his show never aired it was funny at times but not enough to keep me watching each week.
2,Good Season! Problem with something on the DVD's,"Dexter Season 6 did not disappoint me at all it was the 2-minute SHOWTIME advertisement that I was forced to watch before every disc. I know two minutes is really short but the fact that I couldn't hit menu, fast forward or skip on a DVD that I purchased was extremely frustrating! I would love to get this fixed for any future viewings."
5,Every season Dexter is better than the previous,"We really enjoyed watching Dexter but haven't since cable and satellite media vendors demand that you subscribe to an obscenely expensive movie package just to get access to Showtime. With the voucher I got from Google Offers, it is worth it to get season six from Amazon. It was insanely easy to view through the Amazon app on my PS3."
1,Instant viewing did not work......,"I ordered this to be watched on my instant queu, it was so pixelated it was terrible, then it would stop to load. I watched other movies and videos without problem just to make sure it wasn't my connection or hardware."
4,Good season,"Not as good as 4th season, but better than 3rd for sure...on par with 2nd or 5th, in my opinion"
2,On too long,"This was easily the worst dexter season I've seen. The characters just didn't work, they weren't scary or creepy enough. Watching Deb evolve was the only thing that made it worthwhile. I hope season 7 will be better."
3,"Really like the other Dexter seasons, but not this one","I really enjoyed all the other Dexter seasons, since the idea of a likable serial killer is great and makes for interesting stories. Unfortunately, this season is not as good. Religiously motivated killings with keys to the murderer that can be found in the bible - this theme is so overused that even Dexter can't make it interesting."
5,Do I reeally have to say anaything!,Incredible show incredible acting. Been watching it for years and still love it . If your going to watch watch from the very start.
3,Showtime SUCKS,"Dexter is an excellent show...showtime is a greedy selfish company that clearly has only self interest in mind...unbelievable...netflix it is for the next season of Dexter.(although I am sure showtime gets royalties from this as well) Really showtime, how much money do you need? I will never, if I can help it, purchase showtime products again."
1,showtime idiots,showtime programer/editiors are morons who needs ads when you buy the video? i wil no longer buy showtime products ever.
4,Bringing subtext to light,"The complaints other reviewers made about the ""believability"" of Debora and Dexter's characters having ""complicated"" feelings make sense. However, since the first season, the subtext between the two has been that there is a mutually felt attraction. The actors for both characters were romantically involved, and their relationship heightened the tension in the subtext.The reason having the character's confront their feelings makes viewers uncomfortable is that once that subtext is surfaced, it essentially has to conclude. It's like in House when House and Cuddy talked. The moment House and cuddy got together, it became clear the series had to end soon. There was no where else for it to go."
4,"Not the best, but still AWESOME","This was the worst season (8 out of 10), but its still my favorite show. Season 4 is tough to beat (10 out of 10), but I hope they try! I give every other season a 9 out of 10. Given that they are not shy about killing off anyone, I was nervous about the sacrificial lamb...I'm not a fan at all of Deb coming to a certain ""realization."" That's creepy and unnecessary, and actually reduces the credibility of the show. I sure hope they change courses or end that subplot. I cannot wait for Season 7!"
3,What happened?,"Seriously...the first 5 seasons were outstanding, but this was was a confused mess with a lot of really bad elements that made no sense. The religious nonsense with Brother Sam that ultimately went nowhere, and the horrible squicky disgusting idea of Deb being in love with Dexter...Shark Jumping territory right there.Maybe they should have ended it with the 5th season...because if season 7 doesn't retcon most of what happened here, I don't see the show being able to redeem itself."
2,Not tooooo bad,"The edges on the case are all worn out like its been used a million times, so when i gave it to my hubby for his bday i didn't even open the package yet, so when i seen it was pretty worn out, but he didn't really care.... but i wasnt too pleased with the case... i thought i was buying a new everything..."
3,Defective discs,"As the previous reviewer stated, I was also able to scan through the previews on this sixth season dvd set but the video quality is substandard and fuzzy. Ive had problems with the picture locking up, skipping, and I cant get the third disc to play at all! Its not my player as it works fine with other discs, Im just so frustrated with this set?As for the program, Im also a bit let down with this season. Seems that with the ""Nebraska"" show, the writers were just throwing out material to fill up empty space. It seems the whole season lacks the quality Ive gotten used to with ""Dexter"" up to now. Im half way finished with it so far, not even sure if I will attempt to finish it with the trouble Im having with the poor quality discs..."
5,love this show!,"this is our favorite show ! i highly recommend you watch the seasons in order however. definitely an adult show, not for children! but in my opinion its the best show on television currently."
2,Disappointed in Dexter 6,"We eagerly inserted disc one in our blue ray player. After the annoying commercials for Showtime, we found the symbol for DISC ERROR at the top of our screen.We tried the same disc several times and consistently got the same performance. Discs 2, 3, and 4 seem to work properly. We then tried Disc One on our laptopcomputer and it seems to play properly."
4,Another gripping season of Dexter,"We couldn't wait to catch up on the adventures of Dexter and the final scene of the final episode was OUTSTANDING. We can't wait for the next season to begin. We had several nights when we would watch""Just one more episode"" and stayed up way too late."
5,djtennwalk,Soo much fun. I'm glad it's on DVD because I don't have cable. Can't wait for the next season. Wish they made more episodes each year.
5,One of the best shows,"The picture quality was great.. Although the recap of the previous episode was distorted, but went away 15 seconds later.."
3,Ok,"Not as good as previous seasons, took a long time to get going and the villains were not sinister enough e.g when compared with the superb John Lithgow"
2,advertising,"I don't have a problem with manufacturers placing advertising on DVD's that I rent. I figure, I don't own it so that entitles them to place what they want on it. However, If I purchase a product (like I have every season of Dexter) advertising is nothing but aggrivation. But advertising that won't allow you to skip or fastforward thru it is simply holding a consumer hostage. The discs in the Dexter series begin with several minutes of advertising that you can not get away from."
3,I Hate Showtime,No subtitles - really? And having to sit through ads for Showtime on each disc without being able to skip them is annoying as he!!. Major thumbs down to Showtime. The 6th Season however is still classic Dexter with some new twists (Religion) tossed in. But even as good as it is the lack of subtitles is a stupid move by Showtime and those ads! Ugh!
2,The First Time Dexter Disappoints,"Every one and every thing will eventually let you down, and for me, Dexter did that in spades with Season 6. Dexter is one of the few shows I eagerly look forward to, but that is tempered now. Its strengths are its ability to imbue empathy for a serial killer and challenge your assumptions but season 6 challenges nothing. It evokes little but boredom. It is predictable and heavy handed. I have no need or want to own this season, despite having all the previous years. I KNOW if you havent seen this yet, you will side-step this review. I can only suggest you be patient and rent it from the library or borrow it from a friend. Season Six of Dexter is regrettable. As frustratingly bad as the sixth season of LOST. Perhaps HBO has it right in ending a lot of their shows in 5 years.Let's hope for the best for season 7 and 8 (confirmed)."
2,What Happened to Dexter?,"Dexter Seasons 1-5 were cutting edge, inventive and down right shocking at times. I'm not sure what happened with Season 6.The plot of Season 6 starts out with so much potential and truly reels you in only to get bogged down in poorly written plot points and predictable resolutions half way through. For a show whose past season have made me gasp, Season 6 made me ask, ""Really? How has this show become so predictable? None of this makes sense.""Let's hope Season 7 changes things around, but not feeling too bright right now."
2,Writers are Running Out of Topics,"This is one of those series that started with a bang!--ran a couple season off the ""idea"" and has petered out. The 6th Season had a good first show and last show but was FLAT and easily perdictable.. If they want to save the series they need to come up with a really good serial killer who will make the viewers sleep with their lights on!"
2,Dexter has jumped the shark,"As a die-hard Dexter fan, I was somewhat disappointed in Season 5...but MAJORLY disappointed in Season 6. Having Debra appointed as lieutenant was ridiculous and her inappropriate affections toward Dexter are just plain icky. Dexter seems to be playing pretty loose with the code these days too. And what about Harrison? Dexter is too smart to believe that his lifestyle won't rub off on that kid. Meanwhile Dexter doesn't even try to make Debra watch her mouth around him anymore. Sorry to say that I'm probably done with Dexter unless Season 7 has some more believable scripts."
3,tacky cases..,"All disc seem to be fine , however.. the DVD cases were not the original and looks extremely tacky and cheep.Person slipped the original Dexter covers into a cheep cases and it was crooked, not easy to fix."
1,WON'T BUY DVD,"*** DIDN'T SEE SEASON SIX YET *** Just wanted to thank all you reviewers. I am just finishing season 5 and have been watching it on ""instant video."" Enjoying it much more than watching seasons 1-4 on disc which plays those stupid Showtime promos. I'm usually a traditionalist and love watching stuff on the big T.V. But in this case, not worth it."
5,Best series on TV!,"I have seen nearly all episodes from all seasons of Dexter. It is, in my opinion, the best series out. 5 stars!"
5,love Dexter,Dexter never fails....Dexter season 6 was a pleasent surpriseadding Julia Stiles to the cast. It changed things up a littleand gave Dexter a chance to get emotionally involved again afterthe death of his wife in season 3. Love Dexter and his Vigilantekillings!
3,I've seen better,"This season didn't get interesting until past the half way point. It wasn't nearly as good as the previous 2 seasons with Julia Stiles and John Lithgow, although the cliff hanger ending was excellent!"
3,This season not as good,This season was much less interesting. Kind of hokey. Very little real suspense. I did manage to avoid the spoiler for several episodes and then forgot and saw it at about episode 8 or 9. Meh. I wanted to like it but it was bland compared to earlier seasons.
5,Dexter 6,"The Season 6 Dexter arrived shortly after I was told it was being shipped. Came just as described. I love this show, but, can only watch it on DVD because I do not get extra cable channels"
4,"SEASON 6 WAS GREAT, WISH THERE WERE MORE EPISODES","After five seasons, who would have thought Dexter could come up with such a unique plot for season six. Seeing Colin Hanks reminded me of the opposite role he played as an FBI agent in ""UNTRACEABLE"". Can't wait for season seven. I did not appreciate having to watch SHOWTIME's trailers each time we put the disc in any of our players."
3,Dexter 6th Season,"Got this product from Amazon within 2 days of ordering. Great season, lots of twists and turns as always. Such a wonderful show I would almost sign up for Showtime, but if I manage to stay away from spoilers I can wait until latest season comes out on DVD."
2,Boring and cheap season!,"I agree with 2 star reviews! This season is wasting of my movie time! Because, a lots of other TV shows that are more exciting then this season."
3,BEWARE SHOWTIME PLACES DEXTER SPOILER on own disks.,"There is no spoiler in this review... I love Dexter and season 6 did not disappoint me. HOWEVER. When you place these disks in your player for the first time, Showtime runs a mandatory commercial that shows highlights of all its favorite shows, including Dexter. Some idiot decided to include the season 6 conclusion/cliffhanger in it's own commercial. This is an EXTREME SPOILER. If you do not know how season 6 ends, I advise each time this Showtime commercial runs that you close your eyes and plug your ears (or leave the room) for about 2 or 3 minutes. The Dexter top menu will automatically load after the commercial is complete. I would give the disk set 5 stars if Showtime did not spoil the season for me."
1,Dexter is great - Showtime stinks,"There is a two or three minute commercial for Showtime that must be endured every time you put one of the Dexter DVD's into the player. You can't skip or Fast-Fwd through it, you have to just sit there, helplessly, allowing Showtime to ram this long commercial down your throat. I was so angry that I hit the mute button and didn't even look at the screen until the coercion was over. I spent that time (about 30 minutes total) vowing to never subscribe to Showtime, or buy any more DVD's from them (So the commercial was very effective after all). I was luckier than most because I never saw the season finale spoiler that the imbeciles at Showtime spliced into their commercial.If you enjoy feeling powerless and dominated, and paying for it, then you should buy this DVD set."
1,Absolutely DO NOT Buy This DVD,"Season 6 is one of the best seasons of Dexter. However, this DVD will ruin your entire Dexter experience.There is an un-skippable commercial for Showtime at the beginning of each DVD, which shows a clip of the last 30 seconds of the last episode of Dexter Season 6. It gives away a huge plot twist that you deserve to anticipate for an entire season.Absolutely absurd."
5,Love this show.,Dexter is probably my favorite show on TV. Season 6 is really good. There is some religious/biblical references that I found pretty interesting (although bizarre).
1,Terrible disc design,"One star -- not for content, but for the irritating, unkippable preview that so many others have mentioned. Far from making me wish to purchase additional Showtime entertainment, said preview instead makes me wish to give up buying Showtime DVDs altogether. Is this the plan? Drive purchasers online? It reminds one of the telemarketers who have destroyed their own business model by ensuring that no one answers the phone anymore."
2,dexter let down,The makers of this dvd set give away the ending in the previews. The suspence is gone before the show starts. I am VERY dissapointed in the production of this! I have bought every season until now. I won't be buying the next one.
4,"Dexter Season 6, Episode ""Get Gellar""","Dexter was convincing in his search for the killers-de-jour. I am a fan of Edward James Olmos, and enjoyed seeing him in this and other episodes, even, as it turns out, his character had already come to a bad/frozen end!The sequence of apocolyptic scenerios, as depicted by the Doomsday Killers, was entertaining, as the various paintings or quotes turned into the latest homicides for Dexter and MMPD.Looking forward to Season 7. Thanks."
3,download much?,So I payed for this....where is the download to MY computer button? As far as the show goes its great.
1,opening commercial contains a spoiler,"As other reviewers have noted, each DVD in this set begins with a commercial that you cannot avoid (e.g., by skipping to menu or fast-forwarding). Believe me, countless reviewers have tried, and there is no way to skip the commercial. Worst of all, the commercial contains a major spoiler about season 6 of Dexter. In this day and age, it is easy to find any film or TV show for free online -- so why penalize paying customers by making them watch a commercial? And not just once -- the commercial is on every disc and will play every time you insert the DVD. (The whole concept of commercials is that they fund free entertainment such as network TV. In this case, you pay for the entertainment and then get to listen to Showtime beg for your subscription dollar.) Plus, including a spoiler in the commercial borders on PR-suicide. Bottom line: find this content elsewhere. Do not buy these DVDs."
1,The worst season ever created,"I'm not joking, this was more awful than the final season of Lost. It is complete filler, and could be entirely ignored save for the final scene (which they should have written for the season finale of Season 5). The only redeeming quality of Season 6 was Mos Def's acting, and the inclusion of Edward James Olmos. There are just far too many plot holes, inconsistencies, and non-sensical acts here to even consider watching it (really, Miami metro was waiting for a blood spatter analyst before entering a crime scene...not only that, they let him investigate the scene before they entered. While alone in that crime scene, no one from Miami Metro heard him pounding away at the wall with a hammer?). My suspension of disbelief can only take so much.I sold my entire Dexter blu-ray collection after this season aired."
1,wow Dex you let me down!,Well thank goodness for Breaking bad or TV would have totally gone down the drain with Dexter season 6. NO imagination anymore.
5,Questions?,"I got my brother, who lives in the UK, hooked on Dexter with season 1. Gift giving has never been easier at Christmas time. If you have never seen Dexter, I recommend that you watch the first episode of season one. When you do, you will be addicted to a serial killer with morals. My husband was not initially ""interested"" in such a thing. However he now, wants to see what the writers can come up with next...they continue to wow us.Poor Dexter, its getting harder and harder for him to play his part, the rules keep changing..."
3,Michael C. Hall Saves It,"I am totally in agreement with BB's comments of Aug.18th. The LONG Showtime promo at the beginning of each disc (the same one by the way, repeated) with an imposed inability to skip it is despicable. That being said, Season 6 is not that bad but what limits the show from being great is the supporting cast. Their characters are bland, predictable and developed and manipulated to fit a given storyline. Further, (opinion only) they are just not good actors, or perhaps it's because Michael C. Hall is so good that he makes them look bad. All of them, Jennifer Carpenter included, would be better at home on a daytime soap opera. And am I the only one that found the developing storyline about Deb's feelings for Dexter just a bit creepy?"
1,This season was WEAK!!,I couldnt wait for this season to come out. I purchased it as soon as it was available. I wish I could get my money back. This season just felt like they ran out of ideas.
4,Typical 1st episode of the season,"Dexter tends to start a bit slow each season, defining new characters, and setting up the big serial-murderer scenario arc that carries through the season. This season is no exception. By now, the recurring characters are well-known to Dexter fans. A new forensics intern and Bastista's sister are introduced, both recurring. If you enjoyed previous seasons of Dexter, you'll enjoy this one. It gets pretty creepy!"
5,Great,Once I started watching the first disc I could not stop. This season is very exciting and has quite a few surprises in it. It does show a different side of Dexter. I finished the sixth season in 3 days and that is not like me.
1,Showtime Ruined It. No reason to even continue watching,"Thanks to a 3 minute advertisement that could not be skipped on each of the four discs, I knew the ending to the season before I saw the first episode of Season 6. Thanks a lot Showtime. More interested in promoting your other garbage programs than preserving the entertainment of the only program worth watching on your network.I'm taking this back for a full refund. I will, as of now, break with my tradition of purchasing every single Dexter season and will not be purchasing Season 7. Anger does not begin to describe it."
4,Always great writing.,"Good cliffhanger ending, multiple story line possibilities for next season. Not thrilled with the Deb story-line, not as intriguing as it is creepy."
5,Arrived in great shape,I don't know what my wife sees in this series but she is very happy with it. Such a wierd show as far as I'm concerned.
4,Hmmmm,"Either I am Dexter'ed out, or this one is really slow and predictible. I don't think it is as bloodyas some of the past seasons and their are no earth shattering twists to the story."
2,Amazingly poor video quality,"The unskippable channel preview is bad enough, but the video quality is horrendous. Blocking artifacts everywhere, blurred images, and poor color-tone. I love this show, but I'm horribly disappointed by the DVD mastering.All of the previous DVD collections had excellent quality and I anticipated the same from this season. Considering this season was shot in HD, this is really inexcusable. Buy the BD or just skip this season entirely."
1,Thanks for the spoiler Showtime!,"We love this show, and my fiancee and I have been so excited for the release of season 6, so we ran out and bought it the day it was released. Wow. I wish we would have waited and read the reviews on here before we popped in that first disc, only to see the entire season finale SPOILED in Showtime's stupid 3 minute long promo for every show that has ever and will ever air on the station. And of course you cannot skip it, or even fast forward it. No! Then how would they force you to watch the final 6 seconds of the season you are about to start watching? Oh, and it gets better, in case you happen to somehow miss it on the first disc, it's also on the second, third and fourth disc. STUPID!!! What marketing MORON made the call on this one? It's like showing the end of a movie in the trailer. IDIOTIC! It ruined the entire finale for us. Thanks Showtime marketing geniuses. Great job."
1,RIDICULOUS SPOILERS IN THE PREVIEWS,"As other commenters have noted, the previews, which are annoyingly on every single disc, and which cannot be skipped, show the last 5 seconds of the season and reveal a major spoiler. When I saw it, I was in serious disbelief that they would show a huge spoiler for Dexter anywhere, let alone on the Dexter DVD itself. I am extremely annoyed by this, to say the least. Thanks for ruining the show for me."
1,DONT BUY-there is a spoiler in the previews,"So I've waited about a year to buy season 6 of Dexter. Disk one has a bunch of previews for Showtime that you cannot forward through. One of the previews is the last scene of Dexter season 6...the one I am watching...it basically ruins the whole season, I would say what it is but i dont want to ruin it for anyone else. If you buy this, do not watch the beginning showtime previews or the whole season of Dexter (6) will be ruined. So friggen aggrivating!"
3,"good season, the writing was sloppy","Dexter hasn't reached the Weeds of really great series' gone down hill, but this is the worst season so far. I liked the light/dark religious thing and the idea of him having some humanity.The writing is the main thing that bothered me:-The main thing that bothered me was that I feel like the writers forgot that the detectives didn't know Gellar was dead and they kept focusing there search on Travis instead of Gellar.- There usually isn't a bunch of holes in regarding 'why hasn't dexter been caught,' but there were a ton in this season and he took much bigger risks then he should have(there had to be cameras, which he was never worried about)- They had a bunch of side plots that never panned out to be anything: The hand, Deb's crush, Matthews getting fired,etc. Its cool to have some cliff hanger, but they didn't even try to wrap these up. They shouldn't have introduced the side plots if they weren't going to have the time to wrap them up."
3,Disappointing,"This is the weakest of the Dexter seasons. None of them are totally believable, of course, but stories with serial killers who stage elaborate ""tableaux"" for the police and public are really hard to believe in. CSI degenerated into this kind of story and I think it ruined the show. I hope the next season is better. I also found the sex scenes creepy."
3,"Dexter, Season 6 DVD review","On my copy of this - Dexter, Season 6 - I was actually able to skip forward through the Showtime promos at the beginning unlike some of the other reviewers above. Unfortunately, however, the transfer quality on all four discs of season 6 is somewhat fuzzy and what I would consider to be poor and substandard. I have the previous five seasons on dvd and they are all crystal clear unlike season 6, so buyer beware."
2,less than...,"...well... I expected more. I'm glad this was a check out from the library!Ed James Olmos was wasted... his character obvious from the beginning. It was tedious waiting for the ""surprise"".Hanks just did not pose the needed threat, felt as if he'd been bopped with a 2x4 and was acting in a daze.Dexter dumbed down was dull... and, not looking forward to the new sister drama.Get new writers!!!!!!"
4,Dexter,This is a good series but I haven't received this dvd yet. I am also waiting for the seventh season which isn't out yet.
5,DVD,I am still watching it and so far it is awesome. I have seasons 1 thru 6 and cannot choose which I enjoyed more.
5,Dexter Rockes,"Love this show, it has great character development and keeps you glued to your seat. Dexter is a show that you really should start watching from season 1 so you don't miss all of his plots."
5,Great season,"Dexter how do you turn things around every time will keep you on the edge of your seat but, wait til next season"
4,Get it on instant video! The DVD spoils the season!,"Apparently, the DVD of this season has a mandatory advertisement that spoils the end of e season. For this reason, I would get it on amazon instant video (like I did) to avoid those spoilers.About the season, it is not my favorite of the seasons but I do like it nonetheless. A great show, the season lost me for a bit around episode 4 but brought me back in around episode 7. If you liked previous seasons, you should like this one as well."
1,Horrid streaming service!,"What I've been able to see is good. However, the streaming service crashes often no matter what type of device I try to watch it on. Recovery often requires software reboot, and playing guessing games as to where I left off, since the resume feature rarely works.I highly recommend just ordering the DVD's and waiting a few days for them to show up in the mail."
5,Dexter season 6,The product arrived in a timely manor and ran I had no problems running it. It is worth buying new as opposed to used.
5,Dexter,Wonderful story plots. The characters are absolutely wonderful. Well done writers of Dexter. Keep up the good work and we will never tire of it.
4,I love Dexter...,"We love Dexter, even when the season is not up to par. This is good, but not the best... hope season 7 will be better."
5,Dexter Season 6,"Dexter traveled with us to Hawaii and back - definitely made the flight faster and more enjoyable. Loved the new caracters and very interested to see what happens in the final season. It is difficult to review and not want to give the plot or ending away to whomever has yet to watch. We do not subscribe to Showtime and waiting that long to see it will be agonizing, but I love not having to wait a whole week between episodes, either."
5,SO GOOD,"This is my favorite show, so it's hard to say anything negative about the series. Oh well, I give it five stars."
4,Not High-def!,"I love the show but this set does not have a clear picture. I did not order blue-ray for the first 5 seasons but they were fine. This sixth season is blurry, not high-definition. (Maybe its not such a good idea to see the gruesome scenes in great detail?)"
3,"Dexter s6 is great, the dvd set needs improvement",Dexter s6 has been solid. It is one of my favorite seasons thus far. If I was reviewing this for just the content Dexter would get 5 stars. The problem is with the DVD set.For one I hate that you cannot skip over the ads at the beginning of the discs which leads me to my second gripe. One of the clips in the ad ruins the end of this season. I don't know who in their right mind would include a vital scene from the end of the show in the Showtime ads at the beginning of the disc you cannot skip over. Thanks for ruining the ending. My other complaint is that for some reason disc 2 did not work with my laptop.
5,EDGE OF MY SEAT,"Best series EVER!! LOVE DEXTER! I can't believe we got rid of cable, I would get cable again or stay at a friends just to watch the newSeason 7!!"
5,Dexter season 6,"Great season, very intense and unexspected. Still like season 3 the best, but no let downs here. Cant wait for season 7!"
4,Dexter's back!!!,"I was HIGHLY disappointed in Season 5. I thought it in no way lived up to the standards of Seasons 1-4 and I ended up skipping this season because of it. Season 6 hits all the right marks. Great villians, great story arch, NO ANNOYING LOVE INTEREST, and a great ending. As people can probably tell from my capitalized complaint, my least favorite seasons are, in order: 5,7, and then 2. Rita is the only woman whose presence didn't annoy the crap out of me."
1,5 Stars: Series Negative 5 stars (hence the one): Opening previews torture of watcher,"I don't have to rant about how great Dexter Season 6 is, because all Dexterphiles know it's THE show. What I will rant about is the full two minutes of Showtime previews after the DVD loads: there is NOTHING you can do - stop, menu, etc. - to stop the previews of Showtime shows before the menu displays and allows you to select the first episode. I don't give a rat's furry big patootie about these shows: I want to get into the episode. Very crappy and disrespectful of Showtime towards the person who bought the DVD set."
2,Another rage against the DVD spoiler,"Seriously, DO NOT BUY THESE DVDs. It's been said many times before, but download the files or watch them online. I love Dexter and I tried to buy it honestly, only to have the ENTIRE SEASON RUINED by the COMPULSORY 2 MINUTE ADS CONTAINING SPOLIERS on EVERY SINGLE DVD in the set. Thanks, Paramount and Showtime. I'll be sure to never touch another disk. If your mission was to lose customers you've succeeded."
3,Dexter the Sixth Season,I believe Dexter has about run it's course. I am finding the season interesting but it is not as fresh anymore. I am interested enough to watch but probably will not buy a 7th season if that comes out.
3,Colin hanks is no Trinity,"Love dexter as always but this season is kind if weak. Watching Dexter and Colin together reminded me of watching Tom hanks and Wilson the volleyball in castaway. I liked Wilson's acting better than colin hank's however.Hard to believe there was not better talent available to go head to head with Dexter.The writing was much weaker this season. Dexter was not in danger of being found out.Many plot lines with no meaning to the main theme. Debbie, quinn, dexter's nanny etc. who cares? I miss Dokes and lyla."
5,Skip the ads,"I read the reviews and skipped the ads at the beginning as some viewers warned that they would give away the end of the series. Dexter, as usual did not disappoint. The first episode was Dexter trying normal but it soon got back to his version of normal. You also notice a development in his style and a perfection of craft."
3,Not a great season,"I'm hoping that the season is an aberration and that Dexter hasn't totally jumped the shark. While there were things to enjoy overall (the work of Edward James Olmos is always interesting even when he's constrained by weak material) but I found myself feeling increasingly annoyed with (a) a weak villain, (b) the mildly icky Dexter-Deb incest theme, and (c) the total implausibility of how Dexter manages to just 'take off and leave' day or night without anyone raising questions or holding him to account. Honest, people who have real jobs don't typically tend to have that kind of freedom."
3,A mixed bag,"Everything the more long winded reviews of this season have been saying is true! There are more holes in season 6 than a good Swiss cheese. The only thing I can say is if you have watched the series from the beginning be patient. Having watched the entire of season 6, it's still worth the ride, even though some breaks with common sense combined with very flawed character development are practically intolerable. I still hold high hopes they are going to reward us with a more worthy story line in season seven."
3,Not the best season,"We love Dexter and can't wait for season 7 to get released, but this was not our favorite season. Hope 7 brings it back around."
5,It's Dexter! Five stars,Great show. One of the best series out there. I hope they continue to make more seasons. You won't be disappointed.
4,"Dexter 6 , rating good",I would consider Dexter season 6 not as good as 4 or 5. I think the other seasons had more tension.
3,"I'm a big fan, but ending was ruined","I am a huge Dexter fan, so I pre-ordered as soon as it was available. This is not my favorite season of Dexter plot-wise. It seems that this season was mostly a set-up for Season Seven. The other reviews are accurate. I knew exactly how it all would end from the very beginning because the promotional preview for Season Seven gave it away. That said, I'm glad I watched this season. It's necessary for viewing next season, which I think will be great, and these episodes did have their moments."
4,Surprisingly Addictive,"I thought I would hate Dexter, but I am hooked. It's one of my favorite shows. The story plot is really interesting and keeps your attention throughout the seasons."
2,Not totally satisfied with Sixth Season of Dexter.,"two of the four discs had problems breaking up digitally....picture froze several times....one 5 minute segment, there was no sound...I was disappointed. I am very particular and did not touch the DVD & saw no marks or fingerprints on the discs. I'd purchased years 1-5 last year and had no problems."
4,Looking Forward to Season 7,"I am addicted to Dexter. For me this was the worst season, but I still loved it. I didn't like what was revealed about Debra. Too creepy! The last episode was my favorite! Can't wait to see Season 7."
3,A so-so season,"This season was only okay for me. The story seemed to kind of meander a little bit, which I think was a product of it originally being the last season, and then finding out it wasn't so they had to figure out ways to not wrap up the story quite yet. Still good, still Dexter. Here's to hoping for a great last season."
3,Dexter,"Well it was inevitable, I knew Dexter would begin to lose its allure, and this season has begun to show the undoing and eventual demise of Dexter,(You knew it was going to happen). All the shows loose character ends are beginning to knot and I can see the whole Miami Metro dept. Capt on down get arrested, demoted, killed, etc. Hard act to follow the riveting ""Trinity"" killer season. And yet the NEW season begins again. Be good. Be very, very good, or Dex will get you!"
3,If you haven't seen this season yet....,"DON'T WATCH THE COMMERCIAL AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH DVD, it will show you a clip of the ending. As someone who doesn't have Showtime and eagerly awaits the DVD releases, I make a lot of effort to not to read anything about the show so that I won't be spoiled by the time it comes out. It is very frustrating to be spoiled by the disc itself before I even get to watch the first episode. Considering that this is a commercial that offers incentives to subscribe to Showtime, they are acknowledging the fact that they know that some people will be watching this for the first time. There are so many other clips that they could have used instead. I find this to be pretty baffling. Unfortunately,as with other Showtime releases, the disc will not let you skip past the commercial, but don't watch it if you don't want to be spoiled. I still love they show, but I am marking this release down for this reason alone."
3,Death of the Thresher - interesting but disappointing,I found the Polmar book on the USS Thresher disaster to be a quick and interesting read but the large number of typos revealed that proof reading was clearly not a priority for the author. these offbeat incursions removed much of the enjoyment from the book.Now it is on to the Bentley treatment of the same incident.
4,Fine detective work,"The author carefully scoured the record, limited as it is, and presented a strong case for why the Thresher went down. It's not Grisham or Baldacci, but for those interested in naval history, it's worth the time."
2,Hard to read,"Nice solid watch. Unfortunately, it is hard to read the dial. Most difficult to make out the day, month and date calendars. You really have to us a magnifying glass to read them. The watch looks great but not practical"
2,Don't be in a hurry,"The merchandise is nice. The merchant has issues with shipping. ordered on Dec 10 for a Xmas gift, received January 7 (only after a reship was issued). They charged too much for shipping in the first place, could have at least sent the first shipment in a trackable method. Would not recommend merchant."
1,itsybitsy,"Disappointed! Love the design but have since found there are 3 models of this at different heights....what this is adv. as and what you are sent are way different in size and the shipping cost as much as the product...a rip off. Take this product off your list, please."
1,Shameless,"The dirtiest, most cynical, most intelligence-insulting and, above all, most fraudulently profitable lie in audio.The simple truth is that resistance,inductance, and capacitance (R, L, and C) are the only cable parameters that affect performance in the range below radio frequencies. The signal has no idea whether it is being transmitted through cheap or expensive wire.In basic electrical performance, a nice pair of straightened-out wire coat hangers with the ends scraped is not a whit inferior to a $2000 gee-whiz miracle cable. Nor is 16-gauge lampcord at 18 a foot. Ultra high-priced cables are the biggest scam in consumer electronics, and the cowardly surrender of nearly all audio publications to the pressures of the cable marketers is truly depressing to behold. Anyone who tells you otherwise is delusional or a salesmen."
1,Much smaller than the picture suggests,"The picture gives the impression that these beads are much larger than they are---they are actually very tiny. That must be a doll-sized neck they are using in the picture. I would return them, but the company's policy is that they don't refund shipping costs ($5.95 even though it was sent by first class parcel post mail and is extremely light weight). Rather that be out nearly $6 for that, I'll keep this, and find some future use for it--stocking stuffer, maybe--but I certainly won't do business with this company again. If I could find a way to rate it with minus stars, I would."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"I am very pleased with the workmanship, color of the turquoise, and the speed with which I received it."
4,Nice.,"I bought this as a movie prop. It's nice, quality construction. Even the plastic feels 'different.' Bear in mind that the 'case' is a soft-shell- not a hard case. Other than that, this is a nice little case."
5,Mini ID holder,"I needed an ID holder to hold my DL & my Concealed Handgun Carry License, but something that wouldn't make a Lump in my wallet. All I needed was a quality leather holder like the paper holders some states give you to put your hunting/fishing license in. This was Perfect! Made of leather, two compartments, very thin when closed & when placed in my wallet, it didn't take up much more room than the two license did by themselves......NO LUMP in my wallet to have to sit on all day.Anyone needing a small thin holder for multiple license, or license & gas card, I suggest you order this one first! If your needing one for hold more than 2.....maybe 3 license/cards, then this isn't the one you need.....or get two different colored ones! It is perfect for people who on traffic stops in states that require you show DL & Concealed Carry License at the same time.....this is definitely the holder you need. I'm ordering several more for my wife, family & my hunting/fishing license!!!"
1,wrong dimensions published,"Appears to be a great product but I needed a specific size and the 1x4x3 dimensions published is why I brought them. I received my order today and they are too small actually measuring 1 x 4 x 2 5/8, hence, too small to meet my needs."
1,Ploddingly dreadful,"I couldn't put the book down because I wanted to see just how dreadfully plodding it could become. The story could have been told in 3 chapters. What a relief when the end was reached. Fantasy should have a sense of underlying reality to make it work, but this was just drudgery and off putting as another continuing revelation of supposed southern decay and depravity. Reading this book is good for those who are masochistic and want to see just how much mind numbing drivel they can put up with.The book is so bad that it will surely become a literary classic due to way art is appreciated in this day and age."
1,pure trash at it's finest,total disappointment if expecting the caliber of MIGOGE.....just not there...far too many risks of tarnish too much artistic freedom taken....no wonder citizens of Savanna turned their backs when I asked about the book....
5,Awesome Pan--Bakes like a dream!,"This is a wonderful pan, especially for baking cakes, brownies, etc. They bake perfectly in this pan without crunchy edges or raised centers. It's easy care, too. The lid is a great bonus to protect your food during storage or to take to potlucks and meals with family or friends.Aluminum is wonderful for baking, but just remember not to put acidic foods in it. Foods like tomatoes, fruit, or dairy causes the aluminum to oxidize and darken. If that happens, all you have to do is heat a solution of 1 tbs. vinegar per qt of water or 2 tsp. cream of tartar per qt of water in the pan (you can use your oven) until discoloration disappears. Also, be careful with steel wool pads or scouring powder, because they can damage the finish of your pan.Wish I had discovered this pan years ago! Try it, you'll be glad you did."
4,I wanted two for Christmas presents and ended up with only one.,"I ordered two for Christmas presents,when they came,one had a dent in it. Amazon was very good about exchanging it,but the second had a bigger dent. Amazon was good about taking it back and refunding my money. This was an item that it took the two added together to get the free shipping and they gave me that. As this was a present,I can't say for sure,but I had gotten a big hint that this was a wanted gift. Because I had to return two that were damaged I guess I can't five star the product,but they do have a good name."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"My AirBake Oblong Baking Pan arrived warped and bent on two sides of the pan. Now I need to pay almost $6.00 to return the defective pan to Amazon via UPS. I am very, very disappointed. This used to be a good brand, but I guess that is no longer true."
5,oblong cake pan,Happy to have it for all the holiday and birthday baking. It makes the cakes portable. Even baking. I think it was worth the money.
4,Very sturdy but slightly small,"Product is sturdy and doesn't move around a lot, but it is a bit small. I currently use it as a water bowl and it seems I have to constantly refill it after my dog (husky/lab mix) drinks, and my dog doesn't even drink a lot of water."
3,"Good for the price, still going strong","My pup has had 2 of these bowls for about 6 months. It seems like they will last forever, as long as my dog doesn't misplace them. It has been a good size for food, but turned out to be too small for water once my puppy got bigger. The only downside is that my dog can lift the steel bowl out...splashing water everywhere...or making a ruckus."
3,Great Bowl but....,"It's a great looking bowl, but I was looking for something that my dog couldn't scoot or tip over and he still could do that with this bowl. They are pretty though."
4,Solid Bowl,"A bit pricey for a bowl, but our cats tend to push their bowls all around the kitchen and make a mess. No more. These bowls don't slip and skid and our kitchen floor is thankful for it. Nice tab/cutout on the side, to make picking the bowl up much easier."
4,sizes,"the large is just big enough for dog food, a bit small for a water dish (as we keep having to refill it) and the small is way too small for a medium or larger dog. good 'n sturdy, not easily tipped."
1,"Wait, it's made of melamine?-- That's toxic...","I Googled melamine, and as I thought I'd remembered, it was the contaminant that caused so many pet deaths and food recalls recently. True, the dog is supposed to eat out of the stainless steel insert, but many dogs are messy eaters and the melamine part may end up getting licked or chewed. It's good at least that they listed what the insert surround is made of so people concerned about this can avoid it, but I wish they would avoid using this material in products that come in contact with food. -Anna j."
4,Very Nice and Functional!,I have the bubbles and stars. Good sturdy stable quality bowls. Easy to use access and clean. Fits well in my Cat Playpen.
3,"OK product, poor service","Bowls are fine, but Amazon sent broken ones first, and has not acknowledged my returning (by UPS) the broken ones"
1,Held together by Scotch Tape,"When I received this bowl, I loved it. It was clean, sleek and exactly the right size. I purchased it on January 2nd and I am returning it today because after several washings, I discovered that this bowl is comprised of TWO bowls. One heavy plastic black bowl and a stainless steel insert. That would have been OK except that the bowls are held together by two pieces of clear, super sticky scotch tape. It is very disappointing."
4,Second childhood?,"On this CD, the Firehouse Five Plus Two (Plus Three Or More on this occasion) give free reign to the zany humor which marked their earlier performances. From the song selections (many of them written in the '60s, including ""Mame"" and ""Winchester Cathedral"") to the odd sound effects (a whole chorus of dog howls on Yellow Dog Blues), this is a bit off-beat, even for the Firehouse Five. Don Kinch, who once played tuba for the group, becomes a second trumpet on this session; and on ""High Society,"" George Probert adds two of his students to the group to make a soprano trio. The additional performers, and the use of a number of contemporary songs, make this a somewhat different experience from most Firehouse Five work. It's fun, but it's far from their best."
2,skimming,"i'm having a hard time getting through this book, although the topic is one of my favorites and the writing is ok. it seems to be written by someone who is a bit infatuated with Mr. Bird. and why must he refer to Bird as ""the Birdman"" on every single page? I'm far from an expert on the NBA, but most of the things the author is writing has been covered six times a day on SportsCenter. And the book jumps back and forth, between Bird's time before the NBA and his time as an NBA coach."
4,Good Book,I always enjoy reading Books on Larry Bird.He is truly one of the Greatest Basketball Players that I have ever seen play.His Mind for Play&detail is showcased rather well here.
5,"Larry Legend is a prizewinner, a great sports book.","What I like about Mark Shaw books is that he tells it like it is. Larry Legend not only portrays Larry Bird as a great basketball player but the author criticizes him re his coaching ability and also says he is a failure as a father to his only daughter. That gives a balanced look at Bird, one that I feel is important."
5,Shaw brilliantly captures why Bird is one of the greatest.,"Of all the books I read about Bird, Mark Shaw truly captures why he is one of the greatest minds in the game of basketball. The insights and interviews of the players who played against him and for him showed why he is revered not just by Celtic fans, but by basketball fans worldwide. If you are a basketball fan, this is a must have for your collection."
3,Great read,"If you are a basketball buff you'll enjoy this one. It offers a vast amount of insight into what makes up Larry Bird. The play-by-play journal of many exciting basketball games is a big bonus, as lots of other books today dwell too much on off the court politics and scandals in my estimation. Beware, you might find it hard to set down once you start reading!"
4,Very helpfull,Not much of assistance with the form in the pictures but it is an excellent training aid when Mr. Wong describes the various aspects and the training needed with the strength for each animal.A must for any 5 Animal student
3,You get what you pay for!,"I studied this set before from Doc Fai Wong elder classmate. My version of the same set has 25% more moves. However, the book does an adequate job in the process of introducing the abstract of the set to the reader.For $7.96, what do people expect? Private lessons for intermediate sets like 5 Animals set are usually $25.00-$60 hour."
2,Not too good as an instructional book,"This book has a decent section on history and concept, but very little in the way of demonstrating the art. There is a huge section of pictures, yes, but no reasoning behind any of the various moves. If you're interested in seeing what Shaolin Five Style is like, this is a good text. If you're thinking of learning this obscure art, don't bother."
3,"Good basic book on Five Animals, but needs much, much more","I have trained in Five Animals for 15 years and taught the art for five. I consider this book to be a good basic introduction to this style of kungfu, but it needs a LOT more info to be considered a martial arts masterpeice. #1. To get very much out of this book, you really need a good bit of prior martial arts experience, preferably a kung fu style. #2. The book really needs more explanation. The transitions to each move are not descibed in enough detail and a whole lot more self defense is needed. In fact, much of the self defense shown in the book is a cover up for the real moves that the Chinese masters intended. Overall, it is a great intro to 5 animals, but it needs much much more to be considered a great work. As far as an overview of the five animal essences, well, it rates a B- with me."
4,Good Basic text,It is a good ntroduction to 5 Animal Shaolin Kung Fu. The Authors look at it more from the logical and practicle side.
1,Poor image & audio,"Want to buy a DVD transfered from a guy videotaping from his movie seat ? Or a product that makes a VHS version look great side by side ? Well folks, this is the ticket for you. The print is awful. The film itself is not great, but it's a real 60's period piece, all those great actors in a low budget, poorly lit film with no skin, just mucho tease. Skip it."
5,Alot better than cutting wires,Item recieved it installed correctly no snags. Much easier than cutting wires and easily removed if I want to remove it. And if I sell the car I would want to reinstall the factory radio.
4,Simple Packaging,"The item comes in a simple plastic package. No instructions pamphlet/paper inside. The color coding is printed on the plastic package. Some people might overlook this and discard the plastic package, so take note of this. Coding is also printed on the wires but its harder to read the printing on some of the darker color ones."
3,Good but not for me,"Unfortunately, this harness did not contain all the wires I needed for my 2002 Mazda 626 radio install. It was missing an orange wire, so I had to send it back and buy one from my local shop (at a higher price :[ ). But other than that, they would have served their purpose excellently. The wires were in great ship, build quality is nice, and the fact that the wires are precrimped deserve an extra star. So I rate it 3, even though it's missing a wire.."
1,possibly counterfeit?,"I received this in a timely fashion. However, from previous research, something didn't seem right when I opened the package. The 70-7903 that I had researched had 14 wires. This one, only had 11.Also, the connector was red, not white (as pictured), but I don't think that matters. I called Metra to confirm and they stated that the correct unit does indeed have 14 wires. Also, the ""part number"" is part of the packages' inked label.The unit I received included labelling in the form of an orange sticker, slapped on the plastic bag.Beware if ordering this, but to be safe, just buy it from Best Buy or Fry's - somewhere you can see and count the number of wires.Either this is very old product that Metra CSR's don't know about, or it's counterfeit. Either way, it's not what was described by Metra's telephone CSR and various automobile forums.While the color doesn't matter, the missing three wires certainly do."
3,Could have been better,"This wiring is claimed to be for Mazda 01-07 with four speakers; however, it does not provide the wiring for steering wheel control interface. This unit should have the wiring for the interface made by this manufacturer."
4,Fun for Kids!,"My daughter (20 months) loves the ""ABC Bible Block Pop-Up"" book. Some of the pictures may be a little obscure for a child's ABCs - ""E-Exodus, H-Heaven (clouds), I-idol, J-Jericho, K-kindness"", etc. However, the pop-up cubes in the book should make it entertaining enough for your child, if not exactly educational."
3,Would have been a great studio album.,"Not bad, but I thought it was over produced. Goerge Martin tried to make it sound like a studio album, using an orchestra to back the band. This causes America to lose some energy and makes them sound more like a night club act than a classic rock band. Though it does provide some insight into how George Martin would have handled America's early hits had he produced them. His arangement of Horse With No Name is very interesting."
3,Their first album as a duo.,"Contrary to the official review, this was recorded after Dan Peek had left the band and not before. This was their first album as a duo and it is not bad, but I agree that it was over produced by George Martin. It was America's first commercial flop, failing to crack the Billboard Top 100 Albums chart in 1978 despite including live recordings of many songs that had been big hits just a few years ealier. I think they would have been better off without the backing orchestra and tried for a more ""classic rock"" style performance which was more typical of their live shows."
5,CLASSICS - LIVE!,"Great songs with very different, but incredible, arrangements.Having seen other concerts at The Greek, I can only imagine the incredible how the orchestra looked behind the band.Sound quality is good, but shows some drawbacks of early technology. Enjoy it!"
4,Limitation and Help,"As a Chinese, I can't read the Japanese version, so I can't rate the writing technique of this book. But, base on the Taiwan vesion, I think that the book tell me ""a lucky person need many persons to help and support"". From the book, I find that, every person will have their limitation, base on the different limitation, we could pick our positive life style and just for these different limitation, we should help others."
3,strangely fascinating,"A cast of characters that is different to the extreme, yet fascinating. The descriptions of the Island and it's characters is right on. I would like to read about the further adventures of this witch family (and friends) RJM"
4,Fluffy Fun,This is a fluffy fun book that doesn't require a lot of thought or concentration. I read it on a plane and had a good time. Thankfully it was a short flight - it's really a quick read.
4,quick read,"It was a quick read with interesting characters. First time I have read this authors material, but would definitely read another work again."
4,Solid performances,"This is a re-issue of their 1985 In Concert CD with a different cover. Despite the cover picture, America was a duo in 1985 when this was recorded not a trio (Dan Peek left the group in 1977). But this a very good CD. The performances are sharp and solid. America can rock!"
5,"For all Ultima Fans, a must read!","Smashing! Explains it all, and is exceptional in its coverage of how Ultima IV came together. Wasn't exactly how I pictured it, but tied up a lot of loose ends.After reading this - you'll have to play 1 through 6 again just to see all the easter eggs, the in-jokes, the hidden items, and see it all in a whole new light."
5,Great if you like Ultima,The book is kind of witty and interesting to Ultima players. Best of all it gives vague-ish walkthroughs of the games. They are somewhere between a detailed walkthrough and a cluebook.
4,good portrayal of the experience,"I have no regrets about buying this book. While it lacks the 'nuts and bolts' specifics I had read about, it does well in portraying the day-to-day struggles on an AT thru-hike - or at least it seems to do so since I've never stepped foot on the AT. For my taste, the author does, in a few instances, go too far in writing of his religious beliefs, share campy humor, and, throughout the book, completely overuse exclamation points. Despite all that, I enjoyed reading the book and its overall theme of anybody with enough perseverance can complete the same journey, as I hope to in a couple years."
2,White Blaze Fever,"Skip it! poorly written. Leaves the reader with no experience of the journey. It required a lot of endourance to finish the story. I have read many books written by those who have hiked the AT and this one is a waste of time. Boring and disapointing is the best I can describe it. I had high hopes for it, but it just never got its legs (pardon the expession) Futhermore he ends the book before the final push to Khatahdan and leaves it right there. I simply felt ripped off. You don't know if he made it! He didn't wind the story up just simply stopped. I kepted flipping back and forth, I thought I missed something. A couple really good books on long distance hiking are: A walk in the woods (funny), Cactus eaters, Skywalker, Awol."
3,Not My Fave...,"The Hiker Tips were pretty lame, mostly to take up space, I'm guessing. The liberal use of exclamation points and overuse of 'Once again, hike your own hike' damn near drove me over the edge. I probably would've thrown it at the wall about halfway through it had it been a paperback, but I didn't want to damage my Kindle.Like a through-hike, while reading this book I sat in my arm-chair Damascus and considered whether or not I really wanted to finish."
3,"If he would have said 'Hike your own hike"" one more time ...","Overall, this was a decent account of a successful through-hike by a mature hiker. I enjoyed reading it but the Hiker Tips were distracting placed in the text and the 'Hike Your Own Hike' cliche was overused to where I almost tossed the book. I would recommend the book with the caveat that you read it by saving the hiker tips for the end. AWOL and Iron Toothpick were much better than the old Mountain Slayer."
5,You'll be thanking God for this book,"An Encyclopedia of the Book of Mormon and Doctrinal terms written by 100+ of the best scholars on the Book of Mormon.Ezra Taft Benson (a prophet of the LDS church) has said, ""There is a POWER which will begin to flow into our lives THE MOMENT you begin a serious study of the book"" Ensign 16(Nov 1986) p.7This book, in my opinion, is the most ""serious study of the Book of Mormon"" to date and it has some serious power.--IF--You plan on studying the Book of Mormon for the rest of your life --THEN-- Why would you not own this book?"
3,Guide to Presentations Review,This book is short and concise but is not a very exciting read. It is a helpful guide for those who need answers fast because it provides suggestions to pages in certain sections of the manual.
2,I'm surprised to say this but.....,It got a little boring! It read like one of those trashy sex novels but no one knows anything other than the missionary position....If you are looking for a more actual history of movies stars of the Golden Age of Film - skip this one. If you are into fictional porn of the same kind over and over and over and (whew!) over - you won't be disappointed!
1,Rubbish,"How any true movie fan can praise this book of rubbish really defies a sound mentality.This silly book desecrates the people who created movies and Hollywood. Sure there must have been a few rotten apples in the barrel. Do we have to know ?It is porno fit for pornos, not true movie addicts."
1,Does it get any worse?,"Like many, I love Hollywood dirt, especially when the theme is gay, but this monstrosity is one of the most poorly written examples of the printed word I've ever seen. Was Mr. Porter unable to secure the support of an editor? This mess could be hacked down to half its size and still be too long. It's a shallow, dull, embarassment and several times during this grueling read, I honestly feared for Mr. Porter's sanity. With such richness of source material it's hard to conceive that such a narrow, unimaginative product would see publication, even by one's own vanity press. Ugh."
4,Hollywoods silent closet,The book took a long long time to ship about 3 weeks. No tracking number was avail to chart the progress of delivery.However when it arrived. It arrived in mint condition as if it were brand new.The book contents are salacious and engaging. It is also much larger than you would expect it to be based on the photo image from the website. It is almost the size of a mid sized encyclopedia over 500 pages. I am enjoying this find immensely.
3,"Salacious, gossipy, interesting.","So is it fiction? Is it Non Fiction? Is it hearsay and gossip? After completing this lengthy tome I'm still not sure. The sex lives and quirks of most of Hollywood's silent era power players male and female but mostly male are revealed in exquisite and somewhat salacious detail in this tale of one 'Durango Jones' as he attempts and succeeds in becoming the ""most notorious faggot"" in all of Hollywood. What starts off as an interesting novel in part one unfortunately becomes rather boring as it progressed with each 'sexual encounter' revealed in detail. However it remains a page turner as you cant wait to see which star is going to be outed next."
4,Great condition,"This book was in great condition when i got it, and has easy descriptions along with diagrams of plays. Good book, for a great price,"
4,A good addition to every GK training library,"This book is light at 120 pages but packs in drills and words for all facets for the beginning keeper - probably U15. Warm up, fitness, and agility are also covered. Good blend of words and pictures to describe techniques. As is my complaint with all GK instruction, there aren't enough words, pictures and progressions to properly (safely) build up a beginner keeper that doesn't posses natural ability."
4,Overall Great mouse,It's a very comfortable mouse.PROS:1. Forward and back button placed on the left side in decent spot2. Quick adjust DPI works great!3. Multi shot switch works and has great color indication in the wheel.4. Extra Teflon skatesCONS:1. Mouse didnt sit level had one side lop sided. I had to use the extra teflon skates to level it out2. the multishot button doesnt shoot that quickly
3,Best for golf gameboy yet,"This game is fun and it saves your game constantly which is a huge plus. Unfortunately, putting is so easy that it may as well not even exist in the game. Putting is a tedious chore with no challenge. Otherwise this game is great.You may want to wait for Mario Golf to be released if you like putting in your golf game."
1,Leaky Purchase,This oil can is a very poor design. It is very difficult to pour oil from the spout without having addtional oil leak from the top of the can. I would not recommend this product to any serious cook.
4,Liquid B Vitamins,"The taste is terrible, but if I use a juice or gatorade ""chaser"" the vitamins are tolerable. I noticed that I started feeling better/had extra energy in the 1st week of taking them."
5,BEST STUFF EVER!,Had used other sublingual B vita's and this is by far much better. I do think anyone using for the first time should take about half a dose due to the nicin in it until you get use to the effects. Will really help anyone that has had weight loss surgery.
1,NO SHOW,"Never received the items, due to undeliverable address don't know how that happened, I looked at the order and my address was correct, so maybe something happened on the shippers end. Oh well still haven't received my refund. Hmmm"
5,Definitely helps,"This provides a much needed boost for me. I'm supplying it now for my two daughters also, and they feel the same way. I don't object to the taste at all."
5,Liquid b-Total,I wil be ordering this product again. Been using this for years.This B- Total is the only one I can find with Folic Acid.
4,CUTE,"These thigh highs are adorable and I purchased them solely for a ""candy land"" themed costume. They are a bit tight on the thighs which is why I gave four stars."
4,Bamboo Shoots After the Rain,"This book provides the reader with great insight into different cultures of the far east. The stories vary in length from just a few pages, to some rather long stories. Each of the stories gives the reader great insight into some of the cultural expectations of the far east, and also the life people lead. From family expectations, to jobs, pretty much any aspect of life can be found in this book. The way it is put together is also rather different since all of the writers are women from a place that many people in the United States do not know a lot about. This book is a great resource for anyone wanting to learn more about the life and culture of the far east. I would highly reccomend this to anyone!"
3,An OK video...kind of boring,"This video is not my favorite, but it's better than others I've seen. My 3 year old seemed to enjoy it pretty well. I like that it has real pictures, real people, and not just drawings. The background music is kind of overpowering which I don't like. It's not very entertaining for kids though, I can see how they might get bored watching it because there are no games, action, dancing, etc. It's just pictures or videos of something with a description. I however, am learning some. :) I have a few other Spanish video's for my child and they are my ultimate favorite because of the interaction, dancing, songs that my kids love and sing along with, and the puppets they use. That is what I was hoping for with this video, but did not get. Still a pretty good video though."
5,we love it!,"My daughter really loves it, watch it again and again. The DVD is every useful to catch her attention. The words is usually used in kids'life and is easy to remember."
4,It can work,"it good for babies they are held by the voice and like the pictures, good idea have since bought other products from this co. and have found they to be high quaility and will buy more in the future."
5,Love it,"I love the fact the they experiment with different styles, but still maintain the same intensity and edge like all the rest of their work. If they kept putting out the same ol' stuff, it would get really old.If you are a TRUE Cave and Bad Seeds fan go out and buy this today. It might take some time to get used to, but once you do it will be awhile before you can take it out of your player.I just saw them perform last night and it was one of the BEST shows I have seen in a long time! They played a little from all their albums and the ones from No More Shall We Part were the most powerful!! You will not be disappointed in this one."
4,Their best yet.,"I must describe this as the best sleepy-time cd I've bought in a while. Musically I think the band is hitting their highest yet, though the lyrics aren't particularly thoughprovoking (or as ... up as on previous albums), but they do make me smile every once in a while, which is a pleasant change. (I would like to add however that I'm glad it's not a live album, the band's sadly not very inspiring live)"
2,"Sad, sad, sad","This is quite easily Nick Caves worst album. I keep trying to find some excuse for these truly pitiful songs, but I cannot. Where once cave's voice was inspired and brooding, it now sounds weak and strained. People have been describing this music as, ""mature,"" but a more appropriate description would be, ""easy listening."" If you like Michael Bolton I strongly suggest purchasing this album, but if you enjoy music that is actually interesting please stay away, please back away!! Instead may I suggest that you check out Lonesome Wyatt and the Holy Spooks at lonesomewyatt.com. You shall be pleased!!"
5,It Grows On You.....ALOT,"My first few listens were a little disappointing. I'm a HUGE Nick Cave fan and I've always favored the upbeat, macabre songs (The Curse Of Millhaven, Up Jumped The Devil, etc). There are no upbeat songs on this album. The piano and Nick's amazing voice are the focus of the album. Once I accepted the fact that it is a down-tempo cd....I couldn't stop listening to it. It is truly a beautiful album with not a bad track on it. Nick's lyrics are as great as we've come to expect. After a few hundred listens (I'm obsessed) I place this in my 'Top 3' Nick Cave cd's. No More Shall We Part ranks up with Henry's Dream and Let Love In in my opinion. Of the 2 ""quiet"" albums (The Boatman's Call and this one) I think there is no comparison. I like The Boatman's Call, but this simply blows it away. I only hope Nick and The Bad Seeds can keep it up. It will be hard to top this; but they always deliver."
4,"An acquired record, but excellent","I have every album by Nick Cave and The bad seeds-that has been commercially released(except Live Seeds). Almost everyone takes a while to settle into your system in order to make an informed opinion. And that was certainly the case with No More Shall We Part for me. In the beginning of listening to this album, I thought it got a bit draggy in places. And I still do believe that with certain selections namely ""Hallelujah"", however on whole it is a very deep emotional album on an incredibly mature scale. Hearing his entire collection one can really see how Nick Cave has grown as an artist, never resting on his laurels just to please his acquired audience.Stand out tracks include:No more Shall we Part, Oh my Lord, Sweetheart come and We came along this road.An excellent follow up to Boatmans call, if not a slight twinge of sadness to know the days of Henry's dream are probably gone forever"
5,Pure Genius,"67 minutes of potent brilliance that gets better with every listen. 'Oh My Lord' is just amazing, as is 'Hallelujah' and 'Fifteen Feet of Pure White Snow', but the strength of this album is in its consistency. Song after song of haunting lyrics and incredibly powerful music from the Bad Seeds that leaves you emotionally exhausted. This is not an album to be taken lightly."
5,"Genius, as expected","I am not sure how many songwriters working today could deliver a twelve song, 68 minute CD that is riveting from start to finish. If possible, buy the limited edition import version as the two bonus tracks are amazing as well."
5,Haunting,"I've had this album since it came out in 2001, and felt that I had to write something about it. I'm a big Nick Cave fan, have pretty much all of his albums, and this is the most amazing one. (My second fave is Murder Ballads - also beautiful and macabre.) It is so incredibly beautiful, but at the same time mysterious and haunting. Every time I listen to it, year after year, it almost brings me to tears. The music and lyrics are so powerful - it reminds me of how Edgar Allen Poe would sound to music. Just simply breathtaking.The most brilliant album of all time. Nothing can compare to this one."
5,Can't wait for Nocturama!,"I've owned this CD for nearly 2 years, and I haven't stopped listening to it yet! It is always in heavy rotation in the car, at home, and at work. Nick just gets better and better with every release! I'm not going to mention individual tracks as, the album works as one beautiful piece. I just can't wait til next month so I can finally hear his next work of art."
4,Great,"Why won't Amazon let you delete your reviews? I retract everything I said earlier. Great CD. Not their best, but worth the money, and indispensable if you're a fan. Retains some of the wild energy and polish of pre-Boatman's Call albums but lacks that album's cohesion. It will be interesting to see which way their ever-changing musical direction takes them in the future."
3,"Love Mr Cave, but...","to my mind, this one pales when compared to the previous release, The Boatman's Call. Seems much vocal straining and over-extension have resulted in a kind of Bryan Ferry 'sound alike' thing; the vocals and passion don't sound nearly as genuine as on the previous release. On the whole, isn't nearly as introspective as some of the paeans on 'the call'; suppose I'm biased, but I know that I won't listen to this one nearly as much as some of his previous recordings. MURDER BALLADS far exceeds this one in passion content, tho vocal stylization is very similar (of course, not reaching that tempo nor chaos.) If you have to pick, choose 'THE BOATMAN'S CALL' for semi-A Capella beauty and inspiration...in fact, that's the main difference between 'The Call' and this, it appears to me; that release was inspired, and this one is a follow-up."
2,Far from their best stuff,"I really can't believe the excellent reviews included here. Maybe none of these people have heard the band's really great work. Cave's voice is clearly on the decline and the songs are not up to Cave and the band's talents. As for the Bad Seed's virtuosity, yes the performances are good, but the instrumentation itself is nowhere near as interesting or unique as earlier works like ""Your Funeral, my Trial"" or ""Tender Prey"". If you like the romantic stuff from ""The Boatman's call"", ""Sweetheart Come"" is a good song, but the rest is quite dull. Sorry."
2,a poor follow up,"I really like BOATMAN'S CALL, along with LET LOVE IN, HENRY'S DREAM, and THE GOOD SON. Unfortunately, NO MORE SHALL WE PART pales when compared to any of those.At times it's a bit too lyricallly indulgent and musically uninspired. The first half is a bore, though the second half has some all right songs.I can't believe the chorus for #4 is ""love letter, love letter...go get her, go get her."" That's just embarassing. Particularly when compared to some of the deliberately difficult phrasing in the other songs.NO MORE SHALL WE PART is Cave's biggest dud since MURDER BALLADS, which I think is easily his worst effort to date. Get BOATMAN'S CALL instead, if you don't have it. If you MUST own this CD as a matter of principle, pick it up used."
2,I Don't Get It,Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds have held court at the top of my musical lifeblood for more than a decade. I was so disappointed when I listened to this album. And even more disappointed when I listened again. I don't get it at all. It lacks all semblence of the melancholic melody and beauty that I have come to depend upon. What am I missing here? Maybe Nocturama will draw me back into their fold.
3,A mellow side of Nick Cave?,"While Nick Cave is usually one of the most intelligent lyricists in rock today, I found this record mildly disappointing.Very simply, you will go quite deep into this recording before you hit an even moderately up-tempo number. There is nothing here that will make up sit up and take notice like -The Mercy Seat- or -Curse of Millhaven-.Nor are most of the the slow songs full of brooding doom like -Song of Joy- or -Red Right Hand-; they seem rather genial, perhaps meant as satire, as surely -God Is In This House- is, but lacking in that intensity I hope for in a Nick Cave record.Of course a ""less than intense"" record from Cave and his band is still going to be head and shoulders above most anyone else's. My favourite tracks are -As I Sat Sadly By Her Side-, -Fifteen Feet of Pure White Snow-, and -The Sorrowful Wife-. But a newcomer to Nick Cave would be better served by -Tender Prey-, -Let Love In-, or the -Live Seeds- albums."
2,No More Shall We Part,"Personally, I would have no trouble parting with this CD. Call me crazy but I was under the impression a lead singer should be able to carry a tune! He has a lot to say in his music, but does he have to say it so repetivly and all in one song? Personally, I like to listen to music without wondering what the artist was going through in his life to make him so whiny. If you like dark lyrics like this, I would say...save your ears from the vocals and buy a poetry book."
2,Disappointed,"I received this ring and I truly love it. However, it was too big. So I immediately returned it to the company (Silvermoon) for a different size. To this date I still have not received the ring. I had ordered a size 11 and all I wanted was to exchange it for a small size 10. I have communicated to the company that I still have not received the ring and they are checking into it. It's been such a long time now that I don't know what's going to happen. I sent it back in a box and wrapped it and put their address on it. I also included my address. Can you help me?Thanks.Susan"
3,A good wheel for a small price,I use this wheel for NASCAR racing 2002 . it is very easy to use i like the brake and gas pedals as part of the wheel. So their is no connection to break or become worn. tHE STEERING IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY.It is a good wheel that is overshawoded by the big name wheels.
5,Leopard dog toy-medium,"This was a replacement. Pumpkin absolutely loves it. Being a spoiled Jack Russell she has many, many toys. Some end up being the flavor of the day but this is definately a keeper for her. It is the perfect size for her to carry around and she loves the squeak."
4,Still the best one-volume translation in English!,"Dr. Danby's translation is an excellent edition of the Mishnah done over into English. The difficulty of understanding a translation of this specialized legal material is made much easier by Dr. Danby's inclusion of several foonotes throughout the text. Dr. Danby has also included several useful appendices which deal with everything from weights and measures to the teachers quoted in the Mishnah. An especially useful appendix is ""The Rules of Uncleanness"" by the the GRA (Elijah, the Gaon of Vilna) help to explain this difficult subject. Dr. Danby uses brackets to mark off text which, though not in the original, helps one to more easily understand the meaning of the text. Even though the book was originally printed in 1933 it is still a timely and valued addition to the library of those who want to understand this timeless text."
4,"Take a left, then straight-ahead","The previous reviewer called this ""smooth jazz,"" but it's not ""smooth jazz"" as radio & marketing people currently use the term. Despite the 1973 recording date and the occasional presence of an electric piano, it's not an attempt at crossover fusion, either. It's just the kind of record you usually might expect from Milt Jackson, away from the MJQ. Just some excellent, straight-ahead bop, delivered with the greatest of taste.On four of these cuts, Jackson is joined by Hubert Laws, Cedar Walton, Ron Carter, and Steve Gadd. I think the combination of the vibes and Hubert Laws' flute sounds particularly nice. The second track, 'SKJ,' is a leftover from the Sunflower session in '72, with Freddie Hubbard, Herbie Hancock, Billy Cobham, and others; but it fits the program perfectly.If you're normally a fan of Milt Jackson or the other players, don't hesitate. Good stuff from the CTI vault."
1,hardly an encyclopedia,"You expect an encyclopedia to be accurate and this book is not.Many facts are wrong, motorcycles are misidentified, the yearly model lists have numerous errors.... Here's just a few examples.Page 185; no FXRS in the 92 model list (I own a 92 FXRS LowRider which I bought new), same page had a pic of a 92 Dyna Daytona, misidentified in the caption as a 91. Page 191; pic of a Softail Standard misidentified as a Springer. Page 92; Evolution engine stated as being produced from 83 throught 98, actually it was 84 through 2000 (a custom FXR was the only model to have the Evo in 2000). If you don't know the facts you can't depend on this book to have them. Don't buy it."
4,Real Man,I gave it 4 stars just because this was way too big for me. I can't use it. It is realistic looking and firm without being too hard. The suction was very good and if it was smaller I would have enjoyed it very much. Lesson learned.
2,WHOAH!!!!!,THIS IS WAYYY TOOO BIG!! My husband and I got it thinking we could use both him and this but I didn't expect it to be this big! I wanted something smaller than my husband not BIGGER!! It say its only 7 inches and 2 1/2 wide. WRONG! It's at least 8 to 9 inches and 3 to 3 1/2 wide! I will NOT be using it haha and to be honest I was kind of intimidated by the package itself lol
3,eeh,"just got this in the mail, and had really been looking forward to it since i ordered it. i am a little dissapointed cause i had ordered it after reading the reviews that were previously posted and thinking it would be bigger than my husband, and sorry to say it isn't. it has a lot of heft to it, i will give it that, but it is definatly smaller than the husband, which will be ok in his absence, but not what i was looking forward to. thought this was going to be a lot bigger. measurments on the packaging say 8 inches by 3 inches......which they are, i measured, but still not what i was looking forward to. kind of dissapointed, not sure i will even bother trying it."
4,Smooth,"Afterdark London is a ""Must-Have"" for those that appreciate the jazz aspect of the Deep House sound. At this point, the only other Afterdark I own is San Francisco.This version is like a cousin of AD:SF. It's a lot smoother, and has a great deal more jazz/soul infleuence. It feels like the vocals are a greater focus than San Fran as well.Both discs are very good and set a very discernable mood for the listener.I could easily see listening to AD:SF when one is getting ready for the evening and then putting in AD:London when the evening is winding up."
2,Average at best,"I was frankly disappointed with the sound of this cd. Having already been familiar with the incredibly well done and unique sound of AfterDark: Chicago, I was expecting a similarly unique flavor here. Instead, I received decent but rather ordinary house mixes that rarely make it into my vast techno rotation."
4,Great For Bartenders,"I work as a bartender, and have found great use for The Bartender's Deck. I keep it on the bar, to let customers look through; kind of like a menu. The mixes in this book are classic and timeless. A great addition to any bar or book collection."
2,Can't get past the scent,"Alberto VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing for Gray, White, Silver Blonde Hair is easy to use and has wonderful conditioning properties, but after repeated applications, I simply can't get used to its sticky-sweet scent. The scent dissipates quickly after application, but enough of it lingers that I've decided to try other finishing conditioners. It's a shame that a single quality mars an otherwise wonderful product, but as far as I'm concerned, the scent of Alberto hairdressing will have to be changed if I'm to resume using it."
4,Good Product,"Whenever I go back to my natural hair color, silver, I use this product as it does add great shine and helps slightly with frizz. I continue to spend quite a bit of cash trying to find a frizz-fixer that works well on my hair, plus living in the deep south just adds to the frizz problems. I agree totally with some other reviewers who complain about the scent - the product has been on the market for so many years it seems they would have remedied that issue by now. Fragrance free would make the product so much more appealing - smells kind of like the after shave my dad wore years ago - ugh!"
2,Alberto VO5 Hair Dressing for Gray/White/Blonde,"It does make my hair shinier than any other product on the market so far, BUT the scent is absolutely horrible and the scent stays on my hair for days. Also it is greasy, not creamy & after using I have to wash my hands, not only to get the grease off but to get the scent off. I've emailed the company about the scent & they just sent me a free coupon for another VO5 product & said their product had been tested for years. But I wonder who tested the scent? Not women who would be using it!"
5,nice!!,"Book was in good shape and as advertised, only compliant is it took longer to receive then most amazon purchases, hopefully seller will ship items quicker in the future, but will deff b buying from them again if I find a item I like. As far as the book I currently train in jeet kune do concepts and use this book for part of my training, deff has helped to improve my training I look forward to purchasing 1st volume of series"
1,Heads keep breaking off,I bought this impact screwdriver to get #2 philip screws off my rotors and I was successful in getting one out of 4 screws. The heads keep breaking off and they are difficult to find in any local stores.
5,JAG = best TV military series,"I love JAG. It was nice to see the relationship between Harm (David Elliott) and Mac (Catherine Bell) grow. Also, the engagement of Bud (Patrick Labyorteaux) and Harriet (Karri Turner). There are a lot of action pack cases captures my attention. I recommend this to anyone who is like military dramas."
3,JAG... and nothing more,"I now have all seasons (1-4) of JAG released so far. It hurts me to give this DVD set anything below 5 stars because I'm as big a JAG fan as JAG fans come... but having seen 200+ episodes on TV before the DVD sets were released at all, I wanted to see more than just the episodes. It's great that I have the episodes but it would've been nice to get more. Not a single minute of special features on the discs (by the way, the sticker on the front said 'with great special features!')... Even some episode commentary would have been nice. That's really disappointing. Seasons 1 and 2 had a few good features. Season 4 has 4 minutes worth... I hope future released seasons offer more."
4,Music is missing,"Loved that season 3 came out so soon but was a little disappointed that they edited Trisha Yearwood's song from ""The Return of Jimmy Blackhorse"". Whenever I hear ""In the Navy"" all I can see is the male stripper with Harm's uniform. They edited that song also. What are they going to do with the series finale song ""100 years""? I mean, I hear that song and see Harm and Mac at McMurphy's. Otherwise, I really enjoyed watching JAG all over again."
3,Good entertainment for the patriotic and romantic.,Better quality of dubbing from 1st season on DVD. Acting improved over first two seasons. Lots of aircraft carrier action as well as court room. It's hard to enjoy if you don't allow for stupid stuff (unauthentic). It's only entertainment and not real life. Good drama/Action/Romance.
1,JAG_ The complete third season,"The program is great,however, even by having to return the first order due to it being incomplete, the replacement was also faulty. One of the discs had a unfixable scratch and one episode did not have an ending..........OH, well.....can't win them all. Wish things were again made in the US of A. Maybe fewer errors."
5,Jawbreaker___Ralph Pezzullo,"Ralph got a book to me that I have been having a difficult time finding. Despite personal family responsiblities he needed to attend to I still received it within the allotted time he stated upfront with a personal note of apology should the delivery have arrived late and an explanation of those family obligations. A personal touch for just one book goes a long way in this world where such concern is often lacking. Thank you, Ralph, and best to your family's health.Bob Gorringe Bob71947@aol.com"
3,Good read,"It's a good overview of the early days of the Afghanistan war. Written by a planner/facilitator, Chief of Station, not a boots on the ground guy. But he does use real names. He gave away too much and was heavily redacted by CIA, and had to sue them in order to release it. Kill Bin Laden by Dalton Fury is a better nitty gritty book on the hunt for Bin Laden"
1,A waste of Paper,"Not sure how many trees gave their lives to print this book but they would have been better served to have been firewood. Between the ""me-isms"", ""the been there done that"", blacked out lines and misspellings. This book was overrated. I read this after ""First-In"" Which I would recommend over this. The author was more focused on his own ego, than telling a story worth reading. Save your money and go to a public library if you have to read this...."
3,American Dad,Am I the only one who has read this who also watches American Dad on Fox TV (incredibly pompous and self absorbed CIA agent cartoon)? Berntsen comes across as personally egotistical and overly macho. Many parts of the book are poorly written despite some of the comments below - it reads like his ghost-writer was trying TOO hard to get across Berntsen's actual words.The reason I give it three stars (despite the extremely annoying ploy of showing CIA censoring as black lines) is the basic story is incredibly interesting and gives insight into the bravery of the men who put their lives on the line when it counted after 9/11. Both the CIA and military come across as competent soldiers putting their country's interest first. It is a much better read than the political spin of Paul Bremer's Year in Iraq.
5,Excellent!,"An important piece of recent history, extremely well told. I recommend it strongly to anyone looking for a good book to read."
3,Interesting insight but heavily redacted,"I read through this book in about a day and found the insights into the book very interesting but the redactions made it often annoying and hard to read. Some of the redactions seemed very silly since the sources where open sources like ABC or CNN. Some of the redacted information could be easily deduced from context or other sources but it made reading the book difficult. If you're going to read this book you should read a long with other sources in that it provides great context and a different perspective and other sources might make the reading a little easier. I hope a second, less redacted, version is published soon."
4,"""Jawbreaker"" Review","Gary Bernsten does an extraordinary job portraying the events that he experienced while over in Afghanistan and gives the reader a vivid picture of the times he and his team endured. While reading this book I felt as I was right next to Gary in making all of his decisions and going through all the emotions he was sorting through. In reading this book I also gained a much wider perspective on the war in Afghanistan and the workings of the government. There is a myriad of information in this book regarding the war including names of people, cities, missions, some of which the CIA retracted before the book was published. I suggest this book to anyone who is interested in the happenings of the war in Afghanistan and curious about the interactions between different parties in times of war."
5,Important,"I recommend this as the best book I've read about the war on terror. Berntsen and Pezzullo provide an exciting, blow by blow account of the war in Afghanistan and the battle against Bin laden and his forces in Tora Bora. They talk about the lessons learned and the frustrations of dealing with a bureaucracy in Washington that can't respond to the situation on the ground."
4,Good read,"This book is very hard to drop because it sucks you in right from the start.This is no James Bond fantasy,this is the real deal and it reflects in the tone of the book.I would have given the book 5 stars but i didn't because of the very annoying redactions which ruined some key bits of the book.Other than that, this is a nice read for current affairs buffs."
3,"Interesting subject matter, but needed an editor","I just finished Jawbreaker. It was an ok read, documenting some interesting events despite wide swathes of blacked out text. My main gripe with this book is the actual writing.The writing flounders on uneccessary details and events that really have little bearing on the actual ""story"". There are several chapters where I could've read one sentence and skipped the rest and got the same information. The actual sequence of events is very interesting, but I wish Bernsten had recanted his story to someone else and let them write it.If you enjoyed this, I recommend Robert Baer's books. Tighter writing, more gripping voice and gets to the point quicker."
2,Interesting... but ultimately obnoxious,"What I liked most about Jawbreaker was the insider details of some of the things that got passing mention in General Franks' book. I, unlike other reviewers, enjoyed the detail of conversations and decisions. Like other reviewers, I thought the author was pretty proud of himself and that got annoying."
3,A must read,"Mr. Bernsten has given us a jewel of a book however, according to Bernsten the CIA has redacted an enormous amount of the text. I would suggest waiting for the next edition which may have the rest of the story which would in my opinion push the book into a five star catagory."
5,Buy it. READ IT!,"Looking for an adrenaline rush that makes you think? Get Jawbreaker. Gary Berntsen is a no-bull... kind of guy, who goes into the hottest spots and gets the job done. He was sent into Afghanistan to defeat the Taliban and corner Bin Laden, and that's what he did in record time, leaving the folks in DC and CENTCOM scratching their heads. Even when he had OBL cornered, General Franks and the military couldn't step up to the plate with a measily 800 U.S. Rangers. Sickening.There's more. Much more. For example, Berntsen was part of a CIA team that was in Afghanistan with plans to kidnap a OBL lieutenant in early 2000, but was pulled out when people in CIA headquarters got nervous. Thanks.Jawbreaker should be required reading for all Americans over the age of 18. All U.S. Senators and Congressmen should be ordered to read it twice."
2,Details missing,"I was disappointed to see many details blackened out. When you start removing details, it takes away from the story line."
2,Jawbreaker,"This book is highly overated,it has more deletions than substance and while probably true,the author seems ""Full of himself "" and glorifying in his own slfimportance."
3,JAWBREAKER,INTERESTING BUT DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW THE SPEAKER. PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO READ THE BOOK THAN LISTEN TO THE AUDIOBOOK!
4,Bush NEEDS Bin Laden to be BIG BAD WOLF AT FRONT DOOR!!,"Did you know the Bin Laden CAPTURE OR KILL REWARD went from zero to $25million, to $50million, and has quietly now been changed back to ZERO again? The reason is Bush HAS TO HAVE Bin Laden to play the BIG BAD WOLF at our FRONT DOOR Role, so he (Bush) can continue to stay in power.The ROOT CAUSE of 9/11 are the Saudi sponsored WAHABI ISLAM Madrassas that continue to churn out SUICIDE BOMBERS!! It is SAUDI ARABIA that is our ENEMY!! Wayyyy back in 1979, the Saudi King was forced to do this, so the Mullahs's got the money they demanded, and proceeded to set up Madrassas all over the Arab World.Don't believe me? You will."
2,I only wanted to read what happened at Tora Bora,"I confess that I skimmed most of the book. The book can't tell the whole story, only the author's personal perspective--as important as it may have been or as he thought it was. However, I trust what he relayed about Tora Bora, in that his urgent requests for 800 troops to be positioned to block OBL's escape were ignored. This helps confirm the notion that I have that Bush never really cared if he got OBL, in fact indicates that he really did not want to get him. I think the Tora Bora failure says volumes about the ""war on terror"" (more than the book does about minor tactics), and fits right in with the pointless, immoral, and distracting war against Iraq. I have such a sad, sick, dissappointed feeling in my stomach about what the U.S. stands for. I hope the recent Congressional elections and the 2008 presidential election can turn this around and make the U.S. something to be proud of again."
2,Audio CD unintelligable,"These comments relate to the audio version of the book. Unfortunately, the author has decided to narrate the book himself. He has an unpleasantly heavy east coast accent and poor annunciation. He also reads very very fast. Since the information presented is procedural and sometimes complex (who reports to whom? who works with whom?), my head was spinning by the middle of CD1 and I gave up. Please hire a competent narrator next time!"
4,Good but not great,"I enjoyed the audio book, but I thought it dragged a little bit at times. I still would recommend it to others."
2,Almost a Waste of $,"The story of course is factual and good, but it is hard to keep track of the story with all of the blacked out areas. I think the author could have inserted alias. Still glad I got it!"
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Not enough about the potential capture of bn laden,, to much about the onset of the afghan campaign."
3,Not bad. A little hard to follow.,"A very interesting topic. Could have been written better. There are many characters involved which leaves little room for good character development for anyone. The book as a whole was a bit scattered and hard to immerse yourself in because of this.I ordered this book and ""First In"" at the same time. They are about the same ops. I am 100 pgs into ""First In"" and in comparison it is a much better read in general. More descriptive, better development over all. This might be because Gary Bernsten had a much more broad command then Gary Schroen, the author of ""First In"".The two books are great to read together. Read ""Jawbreaker"" first though."
2,Ignore the hype - not bestseller material,"If you can get this for $5 or so, go for it but do not pay more. This is a really tepid read with a lot of turgid and uninteresting narrative with little substantial insight into the campaign in Afghanistan or any other operation which is how it should be because these matters are still sensitive. Furthermore, there are some inclusions in the text that really smell like product placement (count the ""Goretex"" iterations). If that's the case they should be paying you to take this pablum off their hands."
3,Jawbreaker leaves much unanswered,"Inspiring documentary of clandestine culture presented in the first person perspective of a patriot who, along with his colleagues, protect and serve at great personal sacrifice. Too much agency editing of ""classified"" material disrupts storyline and impact."
4,Good Book frustrating but good,"I really enjoyed reading this book the author made you feel what it was like to be behind the trenches of war with an enemy that was everywhere. He also made you realize the red tape involved in fighting the war on terror. The only parts that made me crazy was the stuff the CIA removed, but there is enough detail in there that a good reader will figure it out. Good book I highly recommend."
3,What a disappointment,"What a disappointing book. Oversimplistic, lacking in any useful historical perspective or sense of place, DESPERATELY in need of a capable proofreader. Mr. Berntsen has been ill-served by his collaborator.It's possible that if the CIA redactions were restored they might have added to the story, but from the general tone of the book I can only imagine that that's unlikely. Mr. Berntsen's account reminds me of a report by a second lieutenant on his third patrol who could have saved the world if only the REMF's would have put the Army at his disposal. I'm sure there's a great story full of dedicated people for him to tell--I can't imagine why he DIDN'T tell it.If you're satisfied with a story about a crew of ""hale fellows, well-met"" who ""smote the divil an' routed him smartly"" then this is your book. If you're looking for information about how the war in Afghanistan was won, and by whom, you'll have to go elsewhere."
4,How the CIA takes over a third world country,"While readers seeking a definitive account detailing the US military campaign in Afghanistan will not find it in Jawbreaker, those curious to discover what role the CIA played in the immediate post-9/11 operations unfolding in Afghanistan will certainly enjoy Berntsen's chronicles of his time as the head of the in-country Agency element responsible for directing efforts to destabilize and destroy the Taliban and Al-Qaeda presence.Inside, readers will discover the dynamics of dealing with different Afghan tribal/ethnic groups (including the concept of loyalty), brief but interesting looks at strategic-level talks between US and Afghan figures, and ultimately how a combined CIA/Special Forces element took over a country with the support of an indigenous army.Recommended reading for anyone deploying to Afghanistan."
5,"Informative, Proud, Perplexing, and Frustrating","Gary Berntsen gives an exceptionally first rate and profoundly in-depth account of a truly difficult and traumatic period for all countries of freedom and seeking to be free. The huge sacrifices of so few for so many is truly inspiring. Although there were various excerpts blacked out for alleged security reasons, the level of ""in your face"" detail provided by the author(s) offsets this and allows for a rather comprehensive appreciation of events. Unfortunately, the end appears not near."
5,perfect,These pet bowls are excellent! The stainless still bowl is a liner that comes right out for easy water refil and great for quick cleaning! Also both parts are dishwasher safe!
4,Adorable Pet Dish,"I think these bowls are adorable. It is small, so perfect for a cat or for up to a medium size dog that is fed twice a day. Otherwise, the all black in large size, which I bought for a water bowl, would be better for you. Non-skid bottom is nice. Wish the bowl insert was slightly heavier duty, but I'll deal. Cute!"
3,nice but too big for cats,"Not really what I expected. The bowl is very heavy and too big to use as a cat bowl. Very cute print though, so perfect for a small dog."
2,A let down,"Not very much happend in the book, it just plodded on with people getting sick and being upset. It wasn't written very well either. There are so many other great books about the civil war, like ""Rifles for Watie"" by Harold Kieth, ""A Voice From the Border"" by Pamela Smith Hill, and ""In My Fathers House"" by Ann Rinaldi, don't waste your mony on this one."
3,"A sad, depressing book","This is a sad, depressing book. I thought it was well written, but everybody dies. It has to be the people that she loves a lot too. That is not fair. Stories should be a little nicer than that. Especially if the author wants to get young readers, like ourselves, to read. If you like good, but sad and depressing novels, then this is the book for you!"
3,"A very sad, depressing, unfair book!","This book is sad, depressing, unfair, and to top it off, does NOT have a happy ending. Other that that it was pretty well written. The author should try to pursuade the reader to read more of their books, not try to make them lock the whole series in a metal box, then have it buried in their back yard.Other than that, it is a pretty good book. Trust my opinion. This is coming from an 11 year old. Thank you."
1,Too Sad :-(,"I did not like this book! Its too sad! It all starts out when her father died in the war,her mother dies, her cousin and so on and so on. So if you don't like sad ending books DO NOT GET THIS BOOK. I am honest. So that's why I rated this book 1*(star)."
2,Boring,I found this book very boring. It kept saying the same thing over and over. It was also not chalenging enough to read. This is my point of view of this book.
3,"Very, Very Depressing",Not only was this book too short it was depressing and sometimes may make you cry. Even though the Civil War was a hard time she could of tried and made the situation better than it was. I recommend this to anybody that is in a stage of depression or is a depressing person. This book I call it: TOO DEPRESSING!!!
1,Not a very good book,"I was excited to purchase this book for my daughter but was very disapointed. The book doesn't ring very true. The voice doesn't have the complexity of a child, but sounds more like an adult. After reading it I think it must be difficult for a male adult to write from the point of view of a young female. The story of the Civil War is so compeling that it carries the book, but it could have been so much better."
2,Civic war and a diary of a girl,This book is about a girl and here life in the war. I think this is a sad book. I did not like the parts were here famly or friends died from the war or from a bad sickness. I liked the part at the begining where she talked about her favorite holiday and what it was like. I would recommend it to anyone who likes sad books. The book is also boring. I only gave the book two stars because it wasn't very good.
4,interesting book,"I thought this book was very interesting. Usually you hear the story of the Civil War from the side of the Yankees, but this is from the Confederate side. It's seems like a completely different story. Emma is going through a hard time with the war, but I can't help but think that she seems a little conseded at times. Not my favorite Dear America book, but a good one."
4,Pretty Good Book,This book is about a kind and caring young girl living in the time of the Civil War. She is on the south side and her family keeps slaves which they treat kindly. Her mother gets sick and dies along with her brother Cole. Her father goes off to help fight the war. Her aunt and cousin have to come and take care of her. Her house is taken over by soldiers and she and her family have to move to the 3rd floor of their house which is very small. This is a sad book written in diary form. Overall it was very good. I reccomend it to anyone who wants a good historical fiction read.
2,Padded.,"The book is not that thick to begin with, and I think the author ""padded"" it to meet page count. There are many one-sentence entries. Example: ""The weather is quite warm today."" I also noticed that in certain parts, there are huge spaces between where one entry ends and the next begins -- as much as half a page. Also, the voice that narrarated the book was very stiff and formal. I don't know if all Southern aristocrats talked that way, but it bothered me. ""I must confess that at times I simply wish Cousin Rachel would conduct herself in a more appealing fashion."" Another thing I disliked was Emma's constant references to the books she was reading. Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, etc. It was irritating because I'd never read those books and I don't intend to anytime soon. I do however give the book two stars because one rarely sees a Civil War story told from POV of the Southern gentry."
4,Very good tool,"I am very happy with this interlinear. The Hebrew reads right to left like normal, and the literal translation is a great assistance. I have studied Hebew, but am not an expert by any means. That makes this a good tool in my hands. It requires enough work to keep me ""honest"" in my study, but is not so technical and burdensome that ""study"" is the only thing I can do. Since I use the NIV in my pulpit ministry, it is very convenient to have it in the margin for my reference."
1,This is NOT what you are looking for,IF you are looking for the original Hebrew translated into English accurately - then with the interlinear so you can learn Hebrew as you study - this is NOT it. The book is laid our perfectly. But the text is not translated correctly. In Genesis 1:1 Elohim is translated as our english word God. NOT correct !!!!!! The hebrew letters say Elohim NOT God. Names should not be changed from the English transliteration.Does anyone make an interlinear correctly ??? I checked the box so I should get your response if you can lead me to one that is correct.
1,Interlinear NIV Hebrew-English Old Testament,"The asking prices for these USED books are way too high. You can buy the WHOLE bible in greek/hebrew english for $100. If you buy just this one volume, you pay $60 for just Genesis thru Deuteronomy ONLY. AND----the original asking price for this one volume was only $17.95. Save your money and buy quality. Get the whole thing somewhere else. Not a good deal."
4,Going negative: a positive read,Going negative investigates the influence of negative political advertising on American voters. The book breaks old beliefs and describes a disturbing picture of what the future holds if negative ads do not change. Ground breaking and very interesting.
1,Not as good as advertised.,"I needed this book for a class and i hated ""Going Negitive"" so much i shot my teacher...No but, really, the book it boring and analytical. Overall, not a interesting read. Although, it is full of great information, it just happens to be common knowledge."
3,"Fun little book, but not source-worthy","It's an enjoyable little read, and I think it was a pious undertaking by a nice Catholic man, but the book is littered with errors.For example, the author wrote in one part that there are 700 million Catholics. However, by the time this book was written, the population of our Church had already reached one billion. This is a simple fact that any scholar knows. So if the author could get that simple detail wrong, what other mistakes might be in there? That's just one of the errors I found, and it's so extremely basic to the point that it's very discouraging to the book as a whole that this fact could have been gotten wrong.As always, if you do a paper, use multiple sources. If you choose to write a paper on the Vatican and you want to use this book as a source, just be aware that you should use other sources to back it up.But, for fun reading, this is a good book filled with delightful anectodes. It's not a bad buy."
4,Delightful Trivia!,"""The Incredible Book Of Vatican Facts and Papal Curiosities"" is a delightful collection of Trivia for any Catholic fan. Most of the book is divided into four topical categories. Each question is followed by a short answer, usually consisting of one or two paragraphs. The final section deals with topics which demand a longer explanation than those given in the earlier portions of the book. Whether your goal is to up the scores of your trivia team, prepare for your trip to the Vatican or just enjoy learning about the Church, this short book is a quick and entertaining read."
4,Very informative & fun,"This book is not limited to those of the Catholic faith for all-in-all it is really not about Catholicism but rather about the past & present of the Vatican & those people associated with it. Lo Bello's use of an interview-style format makes the book so much more enjoyable. The content in the book is not the common questions most tourists ask about the Vatican but more unique, sometimes scandalous, things most people probably did not even know about. There is no bibliography so you wonder where Lo Bello got his information but nevertheless this book is full of history & facts that does not lose its flavor."
4,A favorite read!!!,"This book brings memories!!! I read it when I was in high school and it remains one of my favorite books to read. I adore the heroine, Druscilla - she is a strong, sensible character. Would recommend it to anyone!"
1,"...And next is Spy muppets, coming in at a whopping ONE STAR!","I got this game probably one, maybe two years ago, and have found it not to be incredibly, how you say, fun. Basicly, it's all minigames. And I'm not talking about Wario-type minigames. No. Those are actually ENJOYABLE. These are just stupid, run-of-the-mill games. I haven't it played in months, perhaps YEARS because I find it so BORING. The makers could have done a MUCH better job. Like, four stars better."
5,Philadelphia Society Cozy Mystery Series,"In Nancy Martin's second installment to her Blackbird Sisters cozy mystery series, newly-minted society columnist & middle red-headed Blackbird sister Nora attends the party anticipating the appointment of her old college beau's father as the next Secretary of the Department of Transportation. The plot thickens when a body is found in their koi pool the next day.In my opinion, ""Dead Girls"" read more quickly than the first Blackbird Sister mystery ""How to Murder a Millionaire.""I looove the knowledge and references to Philadelphia high society rules and parties in this series. The sister's characterizations are nuanced; Mafia don's prodigal son Michael Abruzzo sizzles as Nora's on-again, off-again romantic interest. This is a fun, light-hearted romp through Philadelphia social soirees. Nancy Martin's series is as much fun as Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series. Highly recommended."
4,Witty and Charming Series,"The second book in the Blackbird Sisters' mystery series finds Nora Blackbird escalating her romance with Mick; investigating jewelry thefts; delivering babies (and contemplating one of her own?); solving murders; and trying to clear an old flame - Flan Cooper's name.Nancy Martin does it again with lots of wit and great dialogue. The characters are funny and somewhat dysfunctional.My one criticism (and it's a big one) which only made me give it 4 stars was when Nora shouts out that one threatening word as she is fighting for her life.....""polyester!"" Pleaassse. There is a point where too much wit makes it absurd. And Nancy Martin's editors should have stopped her with that one.In spite of this absurdity, I will definitely read the next Blackbird Sisters book.On a positive note, one area that Ms. Martin explains very well in this second book is why Nora has never learned to drive."
3,An OK read,"This was my first Nancy Martin novel and, no offence, but I probably won't be buying any more. There was never enough tension here to really draw me in. The characters were mostly nice little cardboard cut-outs and as for the murder, who cares. I never felt connected to any of the characters enough to care what happened. Nothing to grab me."
2,Yawn.,"I found the heroine incredibly obtuse and difficult to care for in this book. The first book in the series was good enough to make me read this one. However, I am probably not going to go any further into the series.I cannot understand any of the motivations -- perhaps because I am a peasant. I cannot fathom the family dynamic. I really, really don't give a rat's hindquarters about political scandal as a motive for murder, and the plot was thin as used Kleenex.I gave it two stars because I love vintage couture, which is the only saving grace."
4,Second in the series,"Nora Blackbird is well-qualified to be the social editor of a local newspaper. She is a socialite herself and is invited to all of the best parties. She is shocked and surprised when she discovers that Laura, the wife of her ex-boyfriend Flan Cooper, has been found dead at the bottom of a swimming pool. Flan is the chief suspect, but Laura had a bad habit of stealing jewelry from her wealthy friends, so other people had a motive to kill her. Nora pursues Laura's killer in order to save Flan, but in doing so she puts her own life in danger. This is an entertaining cozy, which should please Nancy Martin's fans."
4,Songs that reflect today's efforts as well,"Found this CD being sold in Kuwait during my first tour. Every time that I listen to it I think how easily most of these songs can be rewritten to apply to the ""war on terrorism."" Whatever your feelings are about Vietnam or Iraq I would suggest this two CD set to any music lover or someone that is interested in US history."
5,First Rate Compliation!,A fine soundtrack from the A&E; special. A good mix of known and lesser known hits from the era gives this soundtrack a freshness without cliché and invokes mood without sentimentality. The speeches intermixed are a reminder that policies have consequences and that the culture at large was reflecting the uncertainty and ambivalence as the war unfolded. A prescient moment for us today.The mystery is why this compilation is out of print and why the high used price? I just got this cd set new and still factory sealed for .99 cents on eBay!
4,everyone can enjoy this DVD,"The stories are fun and do impart some good lessons (and more importantly, easy to understand lessons) and the characters are wonderful. It illustrates the importance of good relationships (friends and/or family) and gives a good glimpse of the power of positive thinking and working together.So why not five stars? I don't know if it's a Paramount thing or a PBS thing , but the seemingly endless litany of ads and promotional videos at the beginning could have been avoided. Even Disney videos let you bypass these and go right to the feature! not these..."
5,Jakers - Treasure Hunt on Raloo Farm,I bought this DVD and numerous other Jakers DVDs for my grandson. He just loves the adventures of Piggly Winks. I would highly recommend this DVD and the other Jakers' DVDs.
5,Loved it!,My son loves this video! He wants ALL the Jakers videos now! I would recommmend this to anyone with children between the age of 3 and 10.
5,gooduns,"I was turned on to this album by my friend Steve Macy in Ft. Wayne. This is a throwback album, straight to the roots of rock. The combination of blues, country, and back beat energy is just amazing. I know you will enjoy it"
5,"Beautiful! Really interesting facts, stories","I love this book! The art is amazing. The text is fun, informative, and enthralling. A perfect present for pretty much anybody!"
4,Dragons,I really loved the artwork in this book. The dragons were shown in multiple situations and the book was somewhat informative. I would reccommed this book for anyone who loves dragons.
3,"Poor Content, Great Art!","A very large and beautiful book but the text and content was not very informative or realistic. I think it's supposed to be the author's personal thoughts/ideas on dragons and not based on any actual mythology. I'm a fan of both dragons and the art of Ciruelo, and bought it solely for his art."
5,Awesome! and then some!,This book exceeded all of my expectations. The illistrations were just so gorgeous and moving. The text was interesting and written such that I did not need a PhD in Dragonology to understand. I bought it as a gift and the person who recieved it is a serious dragonologist. She LOVED the book. Overall it was outstanding!
5,Dragon lovers must have.,"If you love Dragons as much as I, then this book is a must have. Beautiful artwork, and wonderful conversation piece."
5,Fantastic Artwork!,"If you are a dragon lover then this book is for you! Not only does it have fantastic artwork but it is informative as well. It tells about the 3 main families of dragons (earth, fire, and water) and also tells legends and myths that include dragons. The book is very good quality as well, sure to last a long time and bring many hours of enjoyment."
2,Not What I Was Looking For,"Katz is a good writer and I initially picked up this book with enthusiasm. However, he lost me after he attempted to justify one too many times his decision to purchase his dogs from a breeder. At that juncture, his book became less about dogs and more about his status as an ""expert"" on dogs. Do not recommend."
1,A real disappointment,"I bought this book based on how much I enjoyed his previous books. So I found this book to be a real disappointment. Recycled training tips, there was even material that was taken directly from his previous books. And then the plug for Eukanuba/Pedigree/Alpo yuck well hopefully he was well compensated for that."
1,Katz on Dogs: A Commonsense Guide to Training and Living with Dogs,"I don't know why anyone would buy this book. Mr.Katz says himself that he is NOT a dog trainer but a writer, so why buy a training book from him? There are plenty of excellent training books out there that use much more positive methods than you will find in this book.The methods in this one seem out of date. Get a good book by Patricia McConnell if you enjoy a true dog lover who treats her dogs with the utmost respect & love. Katz is just a writer posing as a dog trainer, or even a dog person! He admits that he does not consider himself a ""dog lover"". Don't waste your time."
1,A Poor View on Dog Training,I'll make this short. Katz has written a book disguised as a training guide. I do not feel he should represent himself as what he is not...a dog expert. He is just a writer tapping into a popular subject...dogs. Enough said.
5,Better Quality than Original!,"My Altima needed to have Inner Tie Rod End replaced. Estimate for the part alone came in at $105.99 at local Monroe Muffler/Brake & Service. Then called small independent shop, that quote was for $77.35 for the part.A little research, and I found out that there was same Moog part available at various places on the Internet, and the best shipped price was on Amazon.I've beat the local prices, with shipping - and gotten a superior replacement. The Moog link is so much better quality, even mechanic at the place where I had it installed approved Moog as the best replacement."
5,Mrs May's Sunflower Crunch,"Love these delicious, cruchy snacks. They are easy to carry along for a quick snack that is healthy and lightly sweetened. Makes my happy to see my kids grab a good for them snack. But that means I have to purchase good options for them to choose from. Mrs May's products makes my job easier."
2,Boromir with sound,"I was happy to hear about a new Boromir figure...But this one was crap...His line ""Tis a strange fate that we shall suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing.""Doesnt even sound like Sean Bean the actor that plays Boromir..."
5,Very impressed with this splitter,"I was using a standard (supposedly good quality) 4-way splitter with one output capped as I only need 3 outputs. Measuring signal strength with that splitter versus running the antenna coax straight to the TV, I discovered I was losing 5-6% signal due to the splitter. So I thought I'd give this amplified splitter a try.Wow! On average, I've gained 10-12% signal strength on all channels. A few channels that were too weak before to lock-in a good signal are now quite watchable. Channels that were ""good"" before are now ""very good"". I highly recommend this splitter."
2,"Great film, bad picture","Dreadful quality transfer, but an excellent film - Joan Collins really shines in this grubby British chiller. Unfortunately (and hugely annoying) the main menu screens the last few seconds of the film, so if you don't want to know what happens you'll have to get someone else to select 'play' for you. How stupid can you get?The film gets a 4 (and a half), the dvd gets a minus 1."
1,Tease,"The price is low, so that I was not expecting much, but I wasn't expecting nothing. One control knob never operated at all. I don't write reviews, but I am writing this one because the quality was low enough to constitute a tease.I had set up my grandson describing the challenge ""The Labyrinth"" represented, it might take him months to run the board, NOTHING."
1,Awful quality,"I did not buy this product from Amazon, had I read the reviews in advance I wouldn't have bought it at all. I played Labyrinth when I was a kid and really enjoyed it. This poor imitation had the feel of a balsa wood airplane and had globs of glue all along the track. The box won't even sit flat on the table because it is out of square and the responsiveness of the controls is terrible. I am returning mine tomorrow."
1,Garbage,"I oredered this a a holiday gift for my grandson. When I gave it to him he was really excited, until he opened it. It is poorly constructed and barely works. He tried playing with it but became quickly frustrated. as he could not get it to work properly. There a two knobs that are supposed to control a tilt of the table up and down and side to side but all that happes is the wood binds against the side and will not allow the up and down tilt. There is apparantly no quality control involved with this toy"
1,Buying firewood!,As a child I had a wood labyrinth and enjoyed many hours of fun challenges with friends and family...but the toy I had then was precise and well manufactured. The one I've purchased through Amazon is useless; with the ss ball getting stuck amongst hard glue residue and in uneven grain (yes the board was not even smooth). My children gave up immediately. Don't waste your time buying a wood labyrinth that's not been quality tested.
5,Classic,"It is the same classic game I grew up with, and I hope it brings hours of frustration to my nephew as it did to me growing up!"
2,"good value, but needs DIY","i have a brio labyrinth, bought in england, which is very high quality. It is no longer sold in the USA for some technical import rule. This version is identical in pattern, though marginally smaller. It is certainly flimsier than the original though the handles have not yet broken after a couple of weeks use. The real problem is the maze itself which hasnt been created with care nor scaled accurately. One can see clearly that the guiding sticks are glued in haphazard fashion, and the ball skirts round them easily avoiding all the obstacles. I had to break a couple of wooden sushi sticks which i glued onto the board to ensure my 10 year old had a real course to navigate. I might also drill a hole or two, when i feel proficient, as there are substantial gaps."
5,Absolutely amazing CD!,"This CD is an absolute MUST for any Kane lover! It won't be very easy to find, but once you do, you'll never want to let it go. It won't be very cheap either, but it's definitely worth the price. After buying it, I swear I've had the entire album on replay for the past 2 weeks. Now that i have this and the Live in London album, I'm dying for some new music as well!"
1,Skip this product!,"What a waste of time and money! Time because I had to drive to a Babies R Us to return these sheets. No, I don't expect a bed of roses (as one reviwer suggested) but I do expect some level of comfort! They are unbelievably stiff, even after multiple washings. They are so bad in fact, that I never even put my son down on them. I use the one I opened and washed as an under layer for the good sheets that I bought on ebay! Just do a search for pack-n-play sheet. You'll be glad you did."
4,A must for your pack 'n play,"It's easier to keep a sheet clean than try to keep cleaning the cushion of the pack 'n play. I'll admit that the workmanship on this sheet isn't top notch, but it serves its purpose. If I were interested in sewing, I could make one that looks just as good as this one, but I don't/won't sew. Got a second sheet for the pack 'n play at Grandma's house. Gotta have a sheet."
2,OK,These sheets are OK. I mean yeah you can wash them so thats good and they are soft which is good. But they are so thin that if your kid spits up it goes right through. My son spit up last week and it went thru the sheet onto the board thingy. They do fit other playpens than Graco which is nice but still.. way too thin.. I mean at least make them waterproof or something
2,Very Stiff Sheets...,"These sheets are very stiff, even after washing and washing. Unfortunately, I have yet to find another brand of sheet designed for these pack-n-plays. My baby sleeps on them ""okay"" but sleeps much better in her crib which has much softer bedding."
2,Cheap,"These sheets are...very thin, you can see the pattern of the floor through this. If your looking to protect the floor from spit ups and spills this will never do. They are loose fitting which I feel makes them a safety hazard. For a couple dollars more, you can...buy a two pack of pack and play sheets made by Little Tykes. The Little Tykes sheets have elastic on the corners to keep the sheet snug. They are softer and thicker. And are well worth the money. I wish I had never purchased these Graco ones."
1,Do not buy this sheet.,"I wouldn't let my dog sleep on these sheets. They are of the worst quality imaginable. We took ours back and purchased plain ole porta crib sheets and they fit PERFECTLY. I recommend the Koala Baby name brand porta rib sheet. They are available at BRU and have elastic all the way around, making for a snug fit. And the quality is 1000 times improved over the PNP sheets."
1,Awful - stiff & too loose fitting,"This sheet, along with the other colors of the same type are awful! Hard & stiff, no matter how many times you wash them, & WAY TOO LOOSE on the pack-n-play mattress. I have had to configure a 'holding' device to secure the sheets snugly from underneath. A much better option *** PORTABLE CRIB SHEETS !! Not only do they fit the same 27"" X 39"" mattress the play yard sheets say they will fit, & BETTER, they come in a lovely variety of colors & patterns. So avoid these, & get the Koala baby portable crib sheets"
1,Paper thin,"I recently purchased two of these sheets and ended up taking them right back. They say they're fitted but they aren't elastic so they're not that well fitted. They are paper thin. Apparently Graco hasn't put these on their pack n plays and observed the quality! I purchased the Koala portable sheets which were cheaper, thicker, and truly are fitted with elastic! Don't waste your money on these."
3,Not what I expected,The sheet is made from very thin fabric. I was expecting something of higher quality that would be softer on baby's skin.
4,Does the job,"O.k., yes it is thin, it is not the softest out there, but it does the job. To add comfort I have a waterproof pad under it which I think is a must in playards anyways because it is not easy to clean the matress pad they come with.I have had no problems with bleeding, and I wash it very often and it has held up fine."
4,Thin but does the job,This is a thin sheet but it fits my full-size Pack N Play bassinet perfectly. I would recommend getting 2 of them because my son wets through it often.
3,They do the job,"These sheets are okay, they fit to pack and play, but they wrinkle very fast and they also collect alot of lint. but they do the job."
3,It Fits.,"I bought this sheet for ourGraco Pack 'n Play Playard with Bassinet, Tango in the TongoThe sheet was surprisingly thin, as others have commented. The sheet even after washing did not soften much. We have preferred to use standard crib sheets, even though they do come un-tucked. My son only uses theGraco Pack 'n Play Playard with Bassinet, Tango in the Tongowhen he has to stay with relatives or we go out of town, maybe 20 to 30 times a year.I would look for something with a little more quality if you are wanting something to fit perfectly."
4,Fine sheet,"This is a fine sheet. We have two of these for our Graco Pack & Play and they fit the play pad perfectly. My only dissapointment with this brand is how impossible it is to find sheet colors that match the P&P colors & pattern. There are no sheets that match the browns and blues of our playard. But it's okay, our baby can't tell. It's thin but no more thin than any of the other affordable fitted sheets I've found. They wash well and do not pill, which is important. Not a bad buy."
3,does not fit,"I bought matress to use on Graco Pack N Play, but this sheet doesn't fit. It works with own Graco bottom."
5,For playard,"This was bought for the Kolcraft mattress I bought for the playard I bought for my new grandson. It's is wearing well, good workmanship."
2,okay sheets,"Sheets were somewhat cheap, I felt. Would, in the future, make sure I buy tshirt material sheets which would be more comfortable for the baby."
3,Cheap & ill-fitting,These are very cheaply made sheets! They DO NOT fit snugly (not even close) & are paper thin. Why didn't Graco make these with elastic sides like a regular crib sheet? I didn't find them to be soft or thick enough to absorb diaper leaks. I purchased the NOJO terry sheets out of frustration with these & they are a much better product.
2,PACK N PLAY WONDERFUL SHEETS,"I AM HAVING A CHILD IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS, SO I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BUY MYSELF A FEW SHEETS FOR THE PACK N PLAY. SORRY BUT UNHAPPY MOM TO BE I AM. I WOULD RATHER STICK WITH DRU_MO_CE WONDERFUL SHEETS--SHE HAS A VERY NICE SELECTION AND A FREE MONOGRAM OF YOUR CHILD'S NAME. LOOK HER UP ON EBAY, YOU TOO WOULD BE A VERY HAPPY CAMPER."
2,...,These sheets are hard as a rock....& the colors/patterns aren't cute (especially for a girl). ...
3,Ehh,"Well, you have to get these for the Pack and Play. I was disappointed though because they are not a super tight fit! They have to much slack in my opinion. The sheet bunches up when she is sleeping. It doesn't come off, but they need to make it snugger!"
2,"Its a sheet, for a baby.","Yup, thats right. Its a sheet for a baby(the one I ordered is grey) . Its not rough, but its not silky smooth and 10 bucks is a little pricey for it. So, it is what it is."
2,"rough fabric, feels cheaply made","The sheet fit tightly on the bassinet attachment for the pack and play, but felt rough, and cheaply made. I can't speak to the durability through washes, because the baby hated the bassinet so much he never slept in it."
4,Okay sheets,"I also almost didn't buy these sheets because of the reviews on this site, but I couldn't find another brand either, so I picked up two of these in navy.The sheets are a bit on the thin side (they are the thinnest sheets we own for him), but since our son has been sleeping in the bassinet in our room since day one, they are the only sheets he's ever slept on. They are okay sheets that are holding up very well, even through numerous washings. Oh, and they aren't elasticized, but it is so tricky to get them on the bassinet, I have no worries that they will come up (we haven't used the play yard feature yet).By the way, we've been using them all through a hot Colorado summer; if this were winter I would definitly be looking for something softer and cozier."
2,Make your own!!,"I purchased 2 of these sheets in the Saratoga print from the store. I washed them several times and the fabric was still so rough and abrasive that I ended up returning them. They do seem to be well made and were easy to put on and take off, which is the only reason I give 2 stars. But if you prefer your baby to have something soft against his/her skin, buy some fabric and make you own; it's very easy and cost much less!"
2,Not impressed,"Actually, I used the sheets only 1 time...like the other reviewers stated, the fabric is not at all soft, but stiff and rough. And yes, the fabric is very thin. I tried washing the sheets a couple times, but the softness just wasn't there. And like the one reviewer, it seemed to pull up on the floor of the pack and play and pop right off. I ended up just wrapping a soft fleece blanket around the floor mat when the baby was in there (which, thankfully, wasn't very much).Sorcha"
2,NOT SOFT AT ALL,Everthing we buy for baby is soft. Why are these sheet so rough. Im mad that I even spent the money on these sheets. I don't feel they fit well and I feel bad making my baby sleep on them. Not a good product. Find another brand.
2,Could be better,"A play-yard is a necessity especially if you travel and sheets are just as essential for it as they are for a crib, especially if you use it for a crib when you are away from home. However, these sheets are not soft and comfy and I have found that they are a magnet for every little bit of hair and lint in the drier. I bought the navy sheets to match the yard I purchased, but they look dirtier coming out of the wash than they do going in. I would like a better quality sheet and I would like the option of flannel. If you have the time and a bit of skill, take one of these sheets apart and use it as a pattern to make your own with better material."
4,Great for Graco,"We have the Graco Clarion Pack N Play and this sheet fits perfectly. Can't understand why there are so many negative reviews about the fit and wear of this sheet. It fits our model perfectly and has withstood many washings well. It is thin, but we haven't found that to be a problem."
4,Wrong color but good product,"I bought this to match my blue and brown pack n play. When I received it the blues didn't match up, so that was a disappointment. Overall a good sheet."
3,Graco specific sheets not necessary for your pack n'play,"I have no problem with this product- it is what it is, a cotton fitted sheet to fit onto your pack n'play. However I found sets of two sheets at Target (Circo brand) for the same price as one Graco sheet and they fit just fine. They are snug so you don't have to worry about SIDS dangers. As a first time mom I was a little reluctant to purchase something for the pack n'play that was designed specifically for it but I saved money by purchasing non brand name."
3,ok sheet,"This is an OK sheet. We have a Graco Pack n Play. The sheet fits well, washes well and doesn't shrink. But it's thin, and not that soft.The Eddie Bauer playard sheets are much nicer, and much better quality, fit well, but I could only get them in cream and brown. I needed other colours so I tried out the Graco. If the Eddie Bauer were available in other colours, I would definitely buy those.Also, for buyers out there, Chicco playard sheets are too small for the Graco Playard."
4,"Inexpensive, easy to wash cover for Pack n Play","I purchased a few of these for my daughter's Pack n Play. We used it a few days a week, and even though the sheets are thin, they lasted for several years of use."
1,Sheet didn't fit our Graco play yard,"We have a Graco Pack 'N Play Sport play yard, bought at a garage sale (so it might be an older model -- but it looks almost brand new) for my granddaughter to sleep in when she stays overnight at our house. I bought this sheet for it, and it didn't even come close to fitting (it was too small...). What's up with that??! I ended up getting a regular crib sheet and adapting it to fit instead..."
2,Thin Fabric.,Waste of money. The fabric is very thin & not very soft. My daughter takes naps in the pack n play. I bought these because I was worried about using a sheet that's too big. All the SIDS warnings say 'only used approved snug fitting sheets.' Well because this sheet is so thin I have to place a burp cloth or towel under her anyway. So I could have saved $10 and just put a towel down.
3,Super thin sheet but it fits pack-n-play perfectly,The sheet is super thin (hence the reason I gave it only three stars) but it fits perfectly. I wish I had gotten something a little softer and thicker.
1,Poor qualtiy,"Bought a hundred dollar pack and play and this was my ONLY option for a sheet. Can't they make the cheap one and a higher end sheet for those who don't mind spending money for better quality??Also, keep in mind your wash loads. I bought this in navy and then realized that everything else I have for baby is pastels. Sheet has to be washed seperately from rest of baby's laundry. Would be better to choose a lighter color that could go into the same load as the rest of the baby's laundry."
2,Don't bother with this item...,"These are thin and a waste of money. Just buy the no-name brand at Babies R Us for portable cribs and they will work fine. Besides, evertime I wash them, they come out of the dryer all covered with lint - such a waste!"
3,I like it,"The sheets are thin, but I was just looking for something to help protect the bottom of the playpen. When drinks spill, you just cannot throw that thing in the washer. I put a thicker blanket under the sheet to help catch spills and use this sheet over top to help keep the blanket in one place. I like it and think I got my moneys worth. It does what I bought it to do."
3,Rough but Helpful,"This sheet was pretty rough even after being washed several times. It fits the mattress, but the long sides come untucked easily. When I use the sheet, I can't use the velcro fastening tabs to keep the mattress down, which is a pain. My son sleeps in it and doesn't mind it. Definitely better than just the mattress, but it could be a better design."
2,not very happy,"Yes it's just a sheet, don't get navy. Yes, I also know it matches colorwise with 90% of the playards out there, but when it's time to wash and dry it, it's a lint magnet!"
1,Buy this instead!,"This sheet is cheap, ugly, and scratchy. Instead, buy a portable crib sheet, they fit perfectly and are available in lots of colors. They are softer and more durable."
1,CHEAP!!!,"While it looks like it would be a great color, it's poorly made (thread count must be super low) and when it comes out of the drier, it has ""balls"" collected over it which also makes the sheet not-so-soft. Go for the white! I have a couple of white pack 'n play sheets and they are holding up much better!!"
2,Not Worth It,"I feel the same way the other reviewers do in the sense that this sheet is not worth the price. It is a very thin sheet and I do not feel it is soft to the touch. I can't imagine it's all too comforting to a little one. I am in search of a thicker, softer sheet because of this."
3,Save your money,"These sheets are highly overpriced. You can get generic sheets from Target for 1/2 the price. The sheets fit well and have kept their color, but since the sheets will constantly get soiled and are very thin, you mind-as-well save your money and get the cheaper ones. You may not find your exact color, but otherwise, its the same sheet."
3,Perfectly Adequate,"Personally I think these sheets are fine. They aren't luxurious sheets, but they are soft. Despite some of the reviews, I think they fit the mattress well and are easy to put on and take off. My son is three months old and sleeps in our Pack N Play (our Pack N Play has a full length bassinet insert). Furthermore, he is a spitter. I am CONSTANTLY washing these sheets and they are holding up well."
4,Yes they DO fit,"The lady below who said they dont fit her Eddie Bauer Pack n Play needs to realize Eddie Bauer is NOT a Pack N Play - Eddie Bauer is by Cosco and is considered just a play yard - all play yards are not considered equal. The name ""Pack N Play"" is exclusive to the brand and therefore these sheets fit just fine. Gave them four stars because they're not the most luxurious or long lasting sheets on the block, but they serve their purpose and fit just fine."
2,Just Too Thin,"I bought one just to try to keep the pad a little bit more comfortable, but it is so thin. At nine dollars I thought it would be better."
1,Don't waste your money,"I wasted my money when I purchased this....they're cheap, thin and very itchy at least on my skin and I can't even imagine my baby's.....I use them as under sheets and I use this cotton very nice and soft receiving blankets I bought in sears on top and that does it for me.....also I bought other cotton sheets but if too thick then it won't fit good so your better off buying other ones from different brands or just using that one and then somethin else on top."
1,Bad Quality,"It's very cheap scratchy material and it bled all over, even with a color sheet. I would say don't buy. I ended up making mine from my own material."
3,Not bad!!,"Mine seem to fit fine, can't see through them and they match perfectly. The thing I was most disappointed about was how rough they are. I thought they would soften with time, which they did, but not enough. I still use them but I bought others that were a little softer - cotton knitted sheets."
4,"Just a sheet, but OH, so important!","I couldn't fathom why the pack'n'play layette bed needed a sheet. The spittle and drool just wipes off, right? Not as easily as you might hope, and these sheets are just the thing to make it easier. They fit perfectly, match fine, and keep muck off the mat. Way to go, Graco - you've done it again!"
2,Not Very Soft or Well-Fitted,We have the Saratoga P&P and I've been very disappointed with the sheet we bought. It's been so bad that we haven't used it yet. The material is very rough and the sheet doesn't fit well when the mattress is in the bassinet position.
2,Need Info,"I'd like to know from Karen where to get the Little Tykes sheets for the Graco Pack n'Play.Also, a baby enthusiast from elkton, md mentions that somebody sells pack n' play sheets at Ebay. I tried searching but can't seem to find it. What category do I enter to find the seller of this item?"
3,They're okay,"We have a Baby Trend playyard, and these sheets fit perfectly. I only use the sheets when we're traveling and my son uses the playyard to sleep in, and I haven't had any problem with the sheets coming off during sleep (and he's pretty active at night!).I will agree that these sheets are lint magnets. Also, they're not the softest sheet in the world, but that does make them a bit more durable. However, since we just use them at night, I would have liked a bit softer sheet. The sheet is also quite thin.The best thing is to not have high expectations for this sheet."
1,Does not fit most pack and plays,I purchased two of these sheets for our eddie bauer pack and play. The sheets did not fit and the words fit most pack and plays can be misleading. I have since returned the sheets and replaced them with another brand of sheets from someone other than amazon.com.
3,I'm not happy with the item,"Hey! I purchased this pack'n'play yard because it is convertible and so multifunctional which is important for us. I must say it is not so easy to assemble it. Other cons:- the changing table is inclined to the left and nothing can be done. When you put the baby on it he will roll to the left:(- the bassinet is so hard to set up, actually my husband had to apply so much effort to establish it. I don't think any woman can do it- wheels are only on one side, thus means you cannot roll the crib to sooth your baby.- the crib is rather small especially when your baby is longPros:- it is convertible nevertheless:)- has mp3 speaking system- I love especially diaper containers on the side. This allows you to have everything within reach.Overall it's not bad and I give it 3 out of 5. Never tried play yard as of yet so cannot say much about it."
1,Terrible fabric,"I am so disappointed with this sheet. It feels so rough. I washed it thinking it would soften, it didn't. I would never let my baby's skin touch this fabric. Yuck."
2,These don't wash well!,"I bought these to use for our co-sleeper, to add a little extra padding and they fit perfectly and looked nice after one wash. After a 2nd wash they were covered in little fuzzy balls (I presume this comes from the underside of the sheet). I wouldn't recommend these unless you plan to wash by hand and line dry every time. Not worth the money!"
4,Perfect for Chicco playard,"We have the Chicco Lullaby LX playard, and initially we had another brand of fitted sheets with elastic edges. However, the elastic was too tight and caused the mattress to bunch up. These sheets work much better -- they fit the mattress without being too tight. My only complaint is that they are a very thin, cheap fabric."
2,Skimpy,I had hoped that this would fit a 3 inch play yard mattress but it only fits the really thin mattress that comes with a play yard. The depth of the sheet printed online -- not just the length and width -- would have been very helpful. Quality of the sheet is fine and I will use it as a cover for the thin mattress.
2,SUPER THIN,the material is SUPER THIN! I'm disappointed with the product. It stays on well but it's just too thin for me.
2,Poor quality for the price,"The fabric is not nice. I was expecting some fabric similar to the cotton crib sheets, but this one feels synthetic and thin. I decided to use one of the jersey crib sheet that I have instead and it worked nicely."
5,THERE BEST LATE 60s ALBUM,"Every song on this album is very good, with mostly cover tunes, but they do a very good job giving there style on it. I have bought a few of these Reportoire cds that come from Germany and they do sound better than any other label i've heard."
4,Yes ? No. Yes ? Yes.,"Is it Yes ? No. Is it Yes' music ? Yes. Does it matter ? NO. This is a fine live recording of Yes music , by 4 key members of Yes. It isn't called Yes , because Yes bassist Chris Squire owns the rights to the name , and he isn't here. But Jon Anderson , Bill Bruford , Rick Wakeman and Steve Howe are. Fine live re-workings of classic material by any line-up. Buy It ? YES !"
3,It is something different,"I heard Dan's new CD. There are some nice songs on there, like Cavaradossi, but songs like Rules Of The Game and My Shining Hour seem to go absolutely no where. My Shining Hour, listen to the saxaphone parts. It is too busy. I think this is a good intro for Dan, and perhaps his arranging skills will get better."
5,"Most People Do It, But JUST DON'T GET PAID FOR IT!","Hello!Wow! What a useful and insightful book! If you are looking at getting involved in or are already a part of Network Marketing, this book should be a part of your library. Find out what works, what doesn't and read about case studies not theories! I particularly enjoyed the insights on the merger between two Newtwork Marketing companies (Pre-Paid Legal adn The Peoples Network) and how it affected Michael Clouse's and Art Jonak's organizations. Killer stuff.Give a copy to prospective distributors. Show them how they are already doing network marketing everyday, but simply not getting paid for it. This book will help them decide to pick up that extra check every month!"
4,You have to work,"This book clearly spells out how the distribution industry is changing, which is network marketing. Network marketing is simply a distribution channel from the manufacturer to the consumer. WalMart and Amazon are excellent examples of this. Have you ever recommended a good restaurant to a friend? You're a network marketer and the restaurant just gained a new client without advertising.Where people go wrong and then share their 'bad' experience is that they don't WORK. One can't just register with a company, occasionally discuss it, wimp around and not do the work. In my 6 years of successful experience, I have found that those who 'fail' didn't do the work and quit. If you fail to show up for your job, you'll lose your job.My only reason for rating this 4 stars is that some of it is written in language/concepts that are hard to grasp by those who have never been in network marketing.Have an open mind and you'll see the Network Marketing profession as a profession!"
3,Forecast of the future of Network Marketing,"Poe does a good job of outlining mlm's growth and the direction the industry is heading. However, he does not outline the way to success in mlm. Randy Gage wrote a book called How to Build a Multi-Level Money Machine that I found extremely helpful because it cuts through the hype and mystery of true success in mlm. Gage gives a system for achieving a growing network and a system that is duplicatable."
5,Your lifesaver in the dangerous e-seas,"Despite all the gloomy news about e-business, our company is jumping in and this book made it so much easier. We tried to get help from a consultant who cost us many times the cost of this book and was of practically no use at all - talked over our heads most of the time and was not able to say anything clearly even when it was perfectly simple. Skip the ""experts"" and try this book."
2,Doing Documentary Work,"This book is useful in giving insight on doing documentary work. However, Robert Coles' writing style seems like one run on sentence after another. After reading the book, I came to the personal conclusion that this form of documentary work is not an art and definitely not science, simply a craft that is heavily biased by the researcher's lens of viewing the world."
2,"Helpful , but very biased","The information in this book is helpful, as are the pictures. However, the author is very dismissive toward anyone who chooses to bottle-feed, despite her statement at the beginning that this book is meant to promote choices. There is a pervading sense throughout that breastfeeding is the magic that will enable you to be a great parent, and I think the issue is much more complex than that. It is also fairly patronizing, at one point stating explicity ""don't bother"" expecting the baby's father to help you with any of the feeding duties if you choose to bottle-feed. I was insulted on behalf of involved fathers everywhere. Another passage suggested that breastfeeding would ""make up"" for your implied failure if you had to have a C-section instead of a vaginal delivery. There must be other books out there with equally good content but without the bias- I would steer expecting mothers away from this one."
4,Good Fixture for the price,"I'm mostly happy with this light fixture. The color of the glass is rich and glows rather than give a lot of light, but it s a nice light for a bedroom or an area that doesn't require bright light. It is attractive, bulbs easy to change, and good looking. I would recommend this product."
3,Much Cheaper Looking Than In Photo,"This light fixture is much cheaper looking than in the photo. I wasn't expecting high quality for $27, but I found better looking similar styled ceiling lights at Home Depot for half the cost (Commercial Electric nutmeg-finish -- $26 for a two-pack). I ended up putting this in a closet. Since Amazon now charges sales tax for shipments to Texas, I've ended up shopping more at Home Depot!"
4,Get a leg up on the competition,"An executive how-to kit for the first 100 days suitable for both small and large businesses - a hard nut to crack. Thomas Neff and James Citrin offer a seven-step action plan for any new executive: do your homework, align expectations, build a management team, develop a strategy, explore and define the culture, find the source of power and set a vision for the company. Few other reviewers have claimed these to be `self-evident' and motherhood and pie, but the examples provided by the authors are well worth the time on their own. The book may not revolutionize your thinking, but it has certainly helped me identify a few underwater stones - experience is cheapest second hand, do not overlook this book."
5,A FAMILY FAVORITE,"We LOVE this CD! If you love a cappella, definitely add it to your Christmas collection. Good mix of fun and sacred songs. This CD has the absolute BEST version of ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" I've ever heard. Very pretty voices and fun (with references to the Elf movie). It's a favorite of my five children ages 5-17. ""O Come, O Come, Emmanuel"" is especially beautiful too, an excellent, haunting a cappella arrangement. I cant believe this isn't available on itunes. Funny, I've always preferred this one to the first Jingles CD, though I love them both."
3,Fun CD,"This is a fun CD but nothing compared to the first Jingles. Some of the songs are a little more ""LDS"" than I would like but they are still fun and the men have done a great job on it but it is a little bit of a let down compared to the first one."
2,Doesn't kill weeds.,"This product may have benefited the grass, and it did make the dandelions a little droopy, but it wasn't really worth it. I wanted a weed killer that would not harm the lawn. I followed the instructions EXACTLY in addition to following the tips list EXACTLY. The droopy weeds are not dead weeds which means this was not the answer for hearty arizona weeds at all. Maybe wimpy midwest varieties are actually killed.Also, even with the water pressure on a gentle low, the bottle emptied within 5 to 10 minutes, not 20 minutes, so it barely was enough for the front of a very small city yard. And, yes, the problem with the dandelions not being killed is in the area that was sprayed first."
4,Courageous and touching,"This is a story of survival, courage and love. It does not focus on the art of war or the death & destruction of war itself but rather the way war destroys hopes & dreams. The way it discharges life and family. It is a story of a man who grew up too quickly and experienced more in his lifetime than anyone should have to. This book encompases love, hate, faith, courage, strength and death. It is tender and touching while still being straightforward and at times brutal."
3,Fascination,"Fascinating account of the genius of evil. However, did I understand that she believes that Israel alone is to be blamed for the terror in the middle-East? And are we to believe that America is the culprit in Iraq with the use of tactics learned from the Nazis? And are we withholding some kind of rights to the terrorists being held at Guantanamo? I hope I missed something for if this is her opinion I would not recommend her writings."
5,Incredibly well written book,"This book is a great book to read slowly and really digest what the author is offering. In the middle of each chapter they have an area called ""Reflection"" and then there are personal stories of others and you can see what their learning has been.I am currently in the process of going back and re-reading and really taking time on some great points made in the book. Highly recommended!"
5,Honky Tonk Legend,"Ernest Tubb was simply one of the best country singers to ever walk before the mike. This box set is an affordable collection of his greatest recordings. Don't let the price fool you--all the songs are great, the sound is wonderful, and the booklet is very informative. If you can't afford the Bear Family sets, this is the way to go. Let's hope Proper keeps doing country reissues."
1,It didn't fit 01 Dodge Dakota 4WD,"It didn't fit 01 Dodge Dakota 4WD, the company refounded my money but not the huge waist of time"
3,Pretty good,"We live in Alaska so only use this product 3 months out of the year (albeit nearly 24 hours a day) to keep moose out of the garden. We used it for four seasons before it died completely. It is NOT water proof. We discovered after it died the first time that we needed to put a plastic bag over the solar panel. We dried it out in the house for a couple of days and it worked again, until the bag blew off and it got wet again... This happened 3 or 4 times in it's short life. It seems like a lot of money for that short time, but the other controllers we have looked at are much more expensive. So it worked well for us while it lasted."
1,zareba SP3B aka... POS,"Brand new out of the box, let it charge up , no weeds in sight, 1 minute after power on, smoke starts billowing out of the bottom. nice product guys, for $130 + I expected a little more.POSPOSPOSPOSPOSPOSPOS"
2,50-50,"We have two of these units, One is working and the other is not, after about a year. It could be partially my fault that the one failed as that particular one was connected to a fence that was touching trees directly, but still after the unit failed, the light kept blinking. Took it apart (carefully of course) and discovered a large burned area in the middle of the board and a 10A fuse that WASN'T blown! Why put a fuse in a product if it won't protect it, and WHY solder in place a ""push in"" auto fuse??? Save up some more money and buy a better electrically designed model than one built by ZAREBA would be my recommendation."
1,seemed to have a little shock the first year....,"3 yrs later. there is so little shock, I can hold my hand on the fence for a good 3 mississippi."
1,never again,"Bought this unit to keep the deer out of my garden. Has been a problem from day one. The indicater light blinks as if it was working all the while holding the fence bare handed. One day it works, the next day it didn""t. What a pain in the @#$. I will never buy a Zareba product again. Completely dissatisfied"
2,Only a few good things,"Fiza is way too violent and melodramatic, and Karisma Kapoor is not good with histrionics. Her other acting scenes were good though. Jaya Bachchan was excellent. Hrithik Roshan did not show his talent through this movie. The story really dips, as does the script, and the only decent songs are 'Mehboob Mere', 'Aaja Mahiya', 'Tu Fiza Hai', and 'Aankh Milaaoongi'. The cinematography has nothing. Only rent once as this DVD is not worth the money."
5,All that and then some...,This album does not disappoint. I'm not big on Grammy nominations but they definitely got this one right. Los Hombres Vol. 3 is a treat from track 1 to 23. Irvin Mayfield's playing is fantastic and Bill Summers brings the straight thunder. The gumbo of sounds and rhythms that they bring to the table is what Latin jazz is all about. I saw this group live at Blues Alley and they were amazing.I must add that Irvin Mayfield is a true gentleman of jazz. I am a beginning trumpet player and I contacted him with some questions. He not only answered my questions - he gave me a quick lesson when he was in town. We need more jazz musicians like him who remember (and act accordingly) the history of this great music.
5,this CD is hot,"listen to it loud, this is good stuff. irvin mayfield burns on the trumpet (just saw them live, where I bought this CD... I'm now buying it for friends), and the rhythm on the album is fantastic. a very worthy investment."
5,Jazzy!,"Having never considered myself a real fan of jazz music, I wasn't in any real hurry to listen to this cd when I received it. Yesterday, I finally put it on the cd player and WOW! Irvin Mayfield is one terrific trumpet player! My favorite song on the cd is Fantizias De Samba, even though it did not feature Mayfield's talent with the trumpet, it was outstanding with John Boutte and Philip Manuel on vocals. The music is catchy and Los Hombres Calientes' talent is undeniable. Their music is an original blend of Jazz, Carribean, and other music styles, and they're cd's are definately worth giving a listen to."
4,Jazz de Caribe Suave,"Esta colección de jazz está fundida con el Caribe y americano influencian, incluyendo Curtis Mayfield, el primo de los artistas. De la primera canción a la ultima, este CD lo que bailar a fuera de su silla. Si tienes alma."
5,An Exciting Book,"This book kept me guessing from beiginning to end. It had elements of mystery, a supernatural aspect, romance and fast paced adventure. I look forward to K.T. Dalton's next book which I assume will continue this storyline.Kudos. I loved it."
4,shaman king volume 2!,"after the big battle with tao ren, another shaman in volume 1, yoh is stuck in the hospital because of 100% integration. all of a sudden, a woman walks in the door. '' who are you? manta and amidamaru asked. '' i'm yoh asakuras fiancé. Anna the itako.'' '' oh, hey anna.''said yoh. "" YOU HAVE A FIANCE????????????"" manta yelled. "" you there. Get me a soda."" said anna. "" WHAT??????? IM NOT GETTING YOU A SODA! YOU-<SMACK> OOOWWWWW!!!! manta teared. ''the orders of the future shaman king's wife WILL be obeyed.'' anna sneered. WHO IS THIS ANNA WOMAN?????????????? FIND OUT IN SHAMAN KING VOLUME 2!!!!!!!!! 7.95!!"
4,Shaman fan,A good manga is always apreciated and the book came in exalent quality when I recieved it. It also came earlier then expected.
2,Rough to the touch,"So many baby products are made so soft and snugly, why can't this be? The sheets get the job done, but have the feel of sandpaper."
4,The game has changed. Learn the new zone attack.,"Beat the zone by creating triangles and passing was how it was taught in my day. Today you'll see the same fundamentals enhanced with picks, back picks, and gap dribbling... heresy 25 years ago. This book teaches the new concepts that are essential to coaching today. I read it cover to cover and now use it as an important reference."
3,"Great T-square, but I wouldn't buy it on Amazon.","This level came bent from shipping, which can make it somewhat difficult to work with. It's quite a hassle to return defective merchandise, and the packaging was poor at amazon. As such, I can only give it three stars as sold here, since no one will be picking it up."
5,Lots of Laughs,"Mae West is outrageously funny as ""Tira"" the lion tamer, a woman supposed to be completely irresistible to all men. Her smart wisecracks, full of double-entendres were her trademark, and here they're at full display, just before the Production Code's censorship toned down her lines, which were written by herself.Her hip-swaying, her moans and fluttering eyelashes, etc., are a joy to behold...her lines, spoken with her woman-of-the-world-reassuredness are top-notch. Her scenes with her maids are especially funny, because they're full of non-stop wisecracks about us men. A must!!A very young Cary Grant plays the object of Mae's affections and Edward Arnold is the circus owner and Mae's employer.The dvd quality is good, although it has no bonus material at all."
5,"Naughty, but Not.","OK. If you love Mae West, Cary Grant, or just comedies, for that matter, see this film!!! It is absolutey hilarious. West can mean more, but say less than any woman in history. Grant is wonderfully romantic and can definetely hold his own opposite her. The film loses nothing in the love story and nothing in the comedy. The only drawback: Grant just doesn't show up fast enough!"
3,Disappointing,"I've read many wonderful things about this movie, and it certainly is an important one in the history of Mae West's career because it is a film adaptation of her scandalous theatrical show called Sex. However, I found it to be quite dull.Basically what we have here is a study about a woman who enjoys the company of men and who gets tired of them as quickly as she falls for them. One day, a special man rolls along (Cary Grant) and she wants to become a one man woman. This does not happen, though, until about halfway through the film.Perhaps the code helped West more than it hurt her. When it was put into effect, she had to censor herself more, forcing her to limit the amount of inuendo used and to create a solid storyline. The lack of any real direction makes the movie more of a curiosity than an endurable classic. There is no refuting West's talent with words and her obvious sexuality, but you CAN have too much of a good thing, and this is a perfect example."
3,Good book but has errors,"I do enjoy this book. The commentary explaining various verses is informative and the the commentary on what is a major part of the daily readings is good. However, there are some errors in the commentary. Certain verses that Mr. MacArthur has chosen to set apart and give commentary on are not the actual verses that he gives commentary on. The verse numbers are correct but the boldface quote supposedly from that verse is wrong and the following commentary is not for the verses that are referenced by the verse numbers. I don't know what he is commenting on.I gave the book 3 stars because the greatest majority of the book is correct. I am a bit disappointed that these errors are included in the book. It should have been better proofread and edited I believe.This is for the kindle version. I havent noticed anyone else mentioning this."
5,John MacArthur Daily Bible,This Bible is awesome! The very best way to read the Bible through in a year. The footnotes are excellent.
5,Everyone should have One,"Very informative, easy to follow, thought provoking. Everyone should have one that thinks they are too busy for daily study. This bible makes it easy and eliminates that ""I'm too busy excuse""."
3,Good helper for when you don't know what to read everyday.,"I like this bible. I still need my other translations (New Livng Translation) for understanding but it really helps me have a daily guide to reading when I'm not sure what to read instead of topic study or word study only. My husband and I have began our devotional with this bible, it was recommended by our pastor and friend."
4,Great resource,I love John MacArthur and this is a great way to increase your knowledge of God's Word. I highly recommend this Bible.
3,This should be a great resource...,"I purchased this in May, 2012. I have read One Year Bibles for 11 years, and find this version to be inconsistent in performance. Sometimes it will move from one reading to the next with a simple click on the link...but too often the link does not show up. I then have to go back to the table of contents to regain my place.I love the commentary by MacArthur, but find myself frustrated by the lack of consistency.I wish it could be updated...I would definitely give it five stars!"
5,Navigation Great on Kindle,"I have the Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle keyboard. The Bible works fantastic on both devices!After reading through the Bible in a year from front to back, I needed a different approach. This was the perfect Bible! Each day some OT, Psalm, Proverb, and NT with a nice daily comment from the author.I checked some sample versions of other daily Bibles and the navigation was horrible! This was exactly what I was looking for. At the end of each section (OT, Psalm, etc), there is a link 'next (date) reading' and the last NT link takes you back to the list of days with links. VERY easy navigation on both Kindles mentioned above. This was my main reason for going with this Daily Study Bible, easy navigation on my Kindles."
5,Read through the Bible in a Year,"This bible makes it easy to sit down and keep a reading schedule that will take you through the entire bible in one year. About 3 pages per day, a section of the Old Testament, a Psalm, a Proverb and a section of the New Testament plus a paragraph or so worth of notes on what you've read.Also, though it is organized so that the OT, Psalms, Proverbs and NT are together for each day, they are in the proper order with chapter/verse numbers so one could easily use this as their primary Bible.I would definitely recommend this if you've found it difficult to sit down and just read through the Bible on your own. It would also be good to use for family devotionals each day."
5,Christianity straight from its original source,"For Christians desiring help with systematic Bible reading, and for anyone desiring to study what Christianity is really saying.Comments from John MacArthur are brief, but enough to be very informative and helpful."
3,Three Stars for Kindle,"I have to agree with the other reviewer(s) that this product is not designed for the Kindle. The content is wonderful but it is poorly organized for the device, and it is a hassle to navigate back and forth between different sections of the daily readings. I'd give the organization/usage 1 to 2 stars. The content, as I said, is good though. I really do like the way the daily readings are divided and the notes (which really do add to my Bible studies). So, I'm bumping up my review to 3 stars.I imagine (judging from my experience with the MacArthur Study Bible vs. the Kindle MacArthur Study Bible, and all the positive reviews) the print version is probably a different-world kind of better."
3,Excellent,The problem I have with this is that the print is too small and I need to magnify it. Wish they had a giant print version.
4,The Bartender's beer cookbook,"I found the recipes interesting,fun to make and delicious. The book is well written with clever uses for all kinds of beer. A ""must have"" for any beer gourmet."
3,A Good Study Bible Overall,"The New American Bible: Saint Joseph Edition is a good bible for most purposes. The New American Bible translation and footnotes are understandable enough, but this study bible lacks an extensive reading guide found in The Catholic Study Bible: New American Bible. It does have a handy doctrinal bible index not found in The Catholic Study Bible: New American Bible. One distinctive feature: Over seventy clear picturesque photographs shedding light on the text. Consider this study bible a cheaper alternative to The Catholic Study Bible: New American Bible."
2,Waisted Time,"I had no problem getting my money back from this company, but I think that the company has a real problem with quality control. The book I received should have never have been sent out. They responded with the products will reflect the fact that pages are missing in the future, but I think they should never sell incomplete products, especially BIBLES."
2,Poor Quality,"I recently bought a pair of these here on Amazon and am rather disappointed. The casting is very crude - so crude that one of my clamps has over 2-1/2"" capacity while the other has only 2-1/8"". The screw is very poorly copper plated, rough to the touch and tough to turn."
4,Helpful,I am a second year kindergarten teacher and I found this book full of useful ideas. Thank you.
1,Visit Belgrade for a week then write a book.,"Something more of a diary or a long letter home than I had expected. The author visits people and recounts their conversations, many of which remind us how mis-understood the poor Serbs really are."
5,Love em all!,I love these books I love piers anthony I love Xanth I read 1-22 didn't have the rest and started the series again. Yon Ill Wind is by far one of my favorites I have read it 3 times now! All these people are saying they are tired of the puns tired of the same ole same ole but come on who can get tired of the puns in all their glory and lamesness they are still fun and they still crack a smile on this face I don't think I will ever stop reading or loving xanth!
3,"Poorly Written, but Still Fun","I am a long-time fan of Anthony's Xanth series. I look back at the older novels with nostalgia, and I picked up Yon Ill Wind after a four-year Xanth hiatus. From the beginning, I was disgusted with how poor the writing itself was. Maybe this is because I'm an English major and a writer and too critical of modern novels, but somehow I didn't remember the old books as being so porly written. It is, however, a fun book, and I'm sure Xanth fans will not blink before picking it up. Non-fans stay away, I say. Far too much ""telling"" and many of the plot points are way too convenient for the characters(yes, it IS a magic land, but in novels that's just something you DON'T do!)"
3,"Good, but not the best Xanth novel","I love Piers Anthony's work, especially the Xanth series, so when I found this book I was anxious to read it. I thought the Demon X(A/N)th's part in the story was great and the ending was one of the best I've read in a Xanth novel. The Mundane family's part in it could have used a bit more work, in my opinion and the part near the end where Law of Averages was appealed could have done better if it was made to fit more than one chapter, as it seemed hurried. Still, it was a good read and kept you in suspence until the end. I would suggest this to a Xanth fan, but if there other Xanth novels you haven't read, I'd try those first"
1,"Enchanting, another winner by Piers Anthony","This book contains plenty of puns, for you Xanth lovers out there. He creates a fantastic plot which keeps you reading for hours on end"
5,Truly an inspiring book,It is one of Piers Anthony's best books ever written. An adventurous love stoy about an abused maiden and a selfish demon who become friends w/some mundanes and learn about love.
4,Mundanes Experience Xanth and Like It!!,"I have been reading the Xanth books since the age of 13 when I first read Castle Roogna and then went back to read the first 2 books in Anthony's first trilogy which has turned into a series of seven ""trilogies"" spanning 20 years. I keep returning the his books purely because they continue to fascinate me. This book features a Mundane family that gets dumped in Xanth due to a hurricane that jumps into Xanth when the ""net"" that controls Xanth's magic is corrupted. It deals with budding sexuality, and how what you see is NOT always what you get. It also has an underlying theme of how parental abuse affects decisions. The ending will touch the heart of the most hardened critic. If it doesn't, maybe you missed the point."
1,Don't purchase,"Have been looking for an outside clock and when I found this one at a low price I purchased. Unfortunately my husband through the box away or I would have sent it back for a refund. Within 2 days of setting the clock and hanging it we found it was running fast. By day 4 it was an hour ahead. We reset it and in a few days it was an hour ahead again; tried this again and the same thing happened - we gave up. My husband purchased a clock replacement timing unit and now the clock stays correct. But having to put an additional $10 out for the timing unit has made this purchase more than I wanted to spend. But then again, I am looking at this as I got the quality of what I paid - LOW. Do not recommend."

4,"Frustrating at times, but brilliantly written and puzzling.","Because of its complex approach to telling the story of two gay men, who move from New York to a small Kansas town after the deaths of five hundred acquaintances from AIDS, through the eyes and voices of a dozen or more characters, this absorbing puzzle is a bit hard to get into at first. Persistence pays off, for Peck brings all of his characters to life, and makes us care what happens to them. He is equally successful in his characterization of the African-Americans and the whites, the gay and the straight, and he keeps the denouement a surprise to the end. The conclusion does not make us feel good, but we know we have been in the presence of a master of the English language and of imaginative story-telling."
5,"YOU'RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE, DEAR READER","I only write reviews of books I truly love. I don't have time to review books I don't enjoy. I want people to read the books I love. Therefore I am adding my five stars worth to the other reviews. I can understand how this book might elicit a wide range of reviews. Understand this: this book is not for the squeamish, or people who feel uncomfortable with monsters, both imaginary and real. This book is a wonderful thriller. The author has managed to create a gothic thriller set in the lonely environs at the center of our country. If this book does not make you afraid of the dark, or make you wince, or at the very least, make you feel uncomfortable, then please check your pulse."
1,Very Disappointing,"What begins as an exciting ""thriller"" ends up being a very disappointing and pretentious hash of a book. Shopping mall pedestrian is the only way I can think of describing this belabored attempt. Redundant and silly."
1,Initially interesting and then repetitive and unconvincing.,"I was originally interested in this very circuitous novel and then it began to come apart. What a disappointment. Just when I thought it was going to go somewhere interesting and alarming it became very melodramatic and silly. And worse still, manipulative. Not to say that fiction shouldn't be manipulative. But I prefer NOT to know that I am being manipulated. It should make a wonderful made-for-TV movie on a future gay romance channel."
2,Close but no cigar . . .,"If only this book was just a little worse -- then, then we'd have something. A pretentious camp classic. A cultural artifact worthy of comparison with David Foster Wallace or Bret Easton Ellis. Something not just awful, but God-awful. Alas, it's a just a failure. Over the top. Lame. Maybe next time, Dale."
1,Artful schlock,"Peck pulls out all the stops to shock and disturb, but it comes off so contrived as to be almost laughable at times. Can you spell PRETENTIOUS? This here is fiction for people who fancy themselves intellectuals. Easy smarts."
1,"This is TRASH, TRASH, TRASH.","I wish there was a negative star button. This is exactly the kind of homosexual propaganda that not only creates horrible gay stereotypes that anger the media further but also one of those books you can't understand because you figure there must be some deep meaning you cannot understand--and guess what? There isn't. Dale Peck, I hope you're reading this. You are flat out corrupting the minds of young readers. Guess what? I'm 14 years old and found this IN MY SCHOOL LIBRARY. I fought to get it removed from my school library and it was(I, myself, through it in the trash bin.) You know a book will be trash when it's listed under the subject heading ""Graphic novels."" Ugh. Thoroughly disgusting."
4,Not bad,"I borrowed the book and read about half. Booth does a nice job of talking about co-dependency in an upbeat way. _Co-dependent No More_ by Melody Beattie is better, but this book stands up well versus most of Beattie's other co-dependency writings. Booth includes prayers and meditations, in addition to common sense advice about ""letting go"" of unhealthy relationships. He has a spiritual focus. This book was not a waste of time, especially for a novice reader in the field of codependency."
4,How I Do Envy...,"...Ms. Blackman's prowess with the drums. I've been a fan since her incredible work with the (otherwise) all-horn combo Saxemble. Her rethinking of a standard like ""My Funny Valentine"" eschews the usual pensive feel of that chestnut and turns it into a swift-moving post-bop workout for herself and her terrific band. Her own compositions ""Call To The Ancestors"" and ""Paradise Island"" are top-notch, full of bittersweet hooks and graceful turns of phrase that stay with you long after the CD is over. Recommended for those who like their jazz ""in the tradition"" but not a prisoner of same. ;)"
4,good book,This is a good book. Really it is. I love those sorts of books though.. a peak into a real persons life.This is about a woman and her journey into unassisted child birth. Lots of good information.Heather mama of 5
2,Misleading Headings,"I bought this book because I liked how it had so many sections for the baby's family history. Reading the reviews above, people commented that it only asks for the Dad's information. It is just extremely poorly written; the sections titled ""My Grandparents"" are actually for the mother to fill in not for the baby's grandparent information. These headings are not even consistent in referring to the mother in the ""my"" sections. Unfortunately I only figured this out after I had filled in about 5 pages for the baby's perspective, as most baby books are formatted. My husband and I had both read through the headings before filling out the pages and it was still confusing. As long as you know this the book is fine. I am not happy with it because the book is now ruined since the wrong pages were filled out."
1,errors and misprints,This is a pretty bad book with huge amount of errors and misprints. It's only good to get an impression of the scope of the exam.
4,A great book,"This is the only book I studied before sitting and passing the exam. As usual the Sybex authors were pretty clear and concise, but I do recommend purchasing some sample exam software to help focus your study."
1,there is no excuse,"the majority of the errata are silly typos and are excuseable.But there is no excuse for telling the readerthe opposite of what is true,especially when you're claiming to be an expert.I bought this book on Heller's name aloneand did not bother to read the reviews here.The book was so confusing I finaly had to check the reviews.From now on, when I see Heller's name,I will check the reviews here first before buying.I hope Sybex got a good use from my $$.I can't say the exchange was a win-win."
2,I don't reccommend this !!,I recommend using additional resourcesto help you pass the exam.A lot mistakes involving Servlet Thread-Safe Model.
3,A good start - but many errors,"This book seemed to be the next logical step after the excellent Complete Java 2 Certification Guide. And this book was a big help filling in the wholes of the things I was unaware of. But be warned, if you have no experience, you will be confused by the errors. There are plenty.Tag names are written to different ways in the same paragraph (<body-content> and <bodycontent> for example). Also some exam questions have the exact same answer twice. Some of the answers are just plain wrong.These test errors also occurr on the CD-ROM.If you catch these errors, you'll be fine on the exam. Otherwise, you may want to find another source to verify some of the text, or wait for a corrected edition.Good Luck."
1,what a waste of money and paper...,"I would probably give zero stars to this edition due to the fact that it is riddled with errors. Sybex corrections have countless links to ""detailed descriptions"" from the book's errata page. All you really need are Servlet and JSP specifications and practice exams (which are available from several vendors).This book is such a waste..."
2,Rushed & poorly edited,"Overall I don't recommend this book - want to buy mine used, I'll give you a good deal!I found so many mistakes in the chapter review questions - from a quality of question stand point that I got frustrated and bought a different book. An Example:Ch 2 Question 3Which HttpServlet method should be used to publish a resource on the server? A doGet B doOptions C doPost D doPutDepending on your interpretation of ""publish"" a knowledgable developer will answer either A or D - I interpret ""publish"" to be what a server does with it's resources when it makes them avalible to the public via downloads - therefore I choose A doGet. But the author chooses D doPut and answers the question like:""A PUT request is used to publish resources at a location on the server"". I disagree with this use of the term ""publish"", it is misleading.This is just one of many examples of poor use of terms that lead to confussion and frustration.Don't purchase this book."
4,"Yes, it works for its purpose","Yes, it does what it is supposed to do. I did a chapter a day, each chapter test, drilled the exams, re-read the book cover to cover the day before the test, took it and got a 76% - passed.But also, it does have substantive typos and a few outright errors in the test engine questions and answers. While I don't excuse it, I want to point out that anyone who has worked with Java and has also taken, as required, the Java Programmer's exam and passed it, will have no trouble spotting the errata. But since this is a technical book, and since the mistakes were fairly obvious, it rates a 4 instead of a 5 star score from me."
2,Did the author read this book?,"Ok, I'm only on chapter 3, and I have found many blatant errors already. In fact, I found 2 errors in adjacent pages on Chapter 3. 1st off, session-timeout is set in increments of minutes, not seconds, page 110. There's a complete lack of understanding of the meaning of url-pattern on page 109, where the url pattern is appended to the docBase as the mapping to the actual class file..??wtf?If the reader doesn't have any experience working with an actual servlet container, he/she will probably just go to the test with the wrong answers. The book is still an OK study guide in that it covers the high level stuff quite well just be sure to test out all the examples and all the conflicting info!"
2,Too many misleading errors to be worthwhile,I agree with most of the previous reviewers of this book: there are simply too many hair-pullingly obvious errors and misleading aspects of this book to make it worth the money.Don't think that you're going to use just this book to pass the exam. You'll need to use other resources in order to pass the test. Case in point: You *will* need to know about the Front Controller design pattern for the exam--which is convienently not even mentioned in the book!!
1,Dangerous Book for Your Certification,"I could not believe that the content of this book is not only of inferior quality, but also misleading you as certification candidates. Many concepts are presented flawed. For example, session variables are not thread safe! Some other concepts are explained blurry using terms that are not standard. It sounds to me that the authors and the editors really need to work on the content, word-by-word, to make this book at least worth for certification preparation book. I used Sybex's Study Guide for the Programmer Exam and found that book to be of high quality. But I am extremely disappointed with this book. I stopped using this book after reading 4 chapters and bought Hanumant Deshmukh's SCWCD Exam Study Kit (ISBN: 1-930110-59-6) and moved quickly to reading that book completely. With that book, I passed today the SCWCD exam with 94% score. For your background, I am a software professional with 5 years of high-level language experience."
2,Their must be a better book on the subject.,This is a poorly structured book. You will find on many occasions the explainations are not complete and what is written is unclear. Their are often refrences to subject matter that has not yet been introduced or explained. Leaving the reader lost. If you are willing to struggle a bit and supplement this book with other material you will find it has some value but for $59... I dont think so. I will be returning my copy shortly.
4,Not That Bad,"The book has contained many many errors as other readers said, but most of the errors are just typo error and will not affect the reader esp. those preparing for the exam.Neglect those errors , the book can list and explain all the exam objectives precisely and present them in a appropriate order.Recommand for those who already have knowledge on web, servlet and jsp. Not for beginner."
1,Shoddy finish causes rejection,"You wouldn't accept delivery of a car which had marks and dents in it, would you? Even if it was the latest turbocharged model.Even for a nice discounted price and excellent service from the distributor.That's what we are being asked to do with this book.It's hard enough trying to absorb all the new concepts that this book is teaching, the amount of errors is too distracting to make learning possible.For now returned, maybe I'll reorder a much later printing or edition - if I still need it by then, I'll look for an alternative."
2,What a shame... this could have been such a good book,"Yes, the book is full of mistakes, many, many, many mistakes (both typos and logic type), but I have to admit I was still able to use it to pass the exam. If you're already familiar with JSPs and Servlets than the book can be a helpful aid in preparing for the exam as you will be able to spot the errors. If you're new to the topic, use other means (online forums, online mock exams, Servlet and JSP documentation, ...) along with this book or you'll be compromising your chance to pass the exam. The book is overpriced in comparison to its contents so buy a used one and get rid of it once you're done with the exam."
1,too many errors,"Philip, do not ruin your reputation gained in the book ""The Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide: Programmer's and Developers Exams""!!! After reading this and other books, I have passed the exam.Here is my view of this book:1 This book had too many errors.2 A lot of concepts were not clearly explained.3. The authors either did not understand these issues very well or they are in hurry to publish this book."
1,This is the worst computer book I ever bought!,"This book is full of errors, and is the worst computerbook I ever bought! I don't know what contents insidethe book to trust.I wish I have saw the similar comments given by othersand bought the other books, such as that entitled as""SCWCD Exam Stdudy kit""."
1,"Disappointed, this book poluted sybex's reputation","I waited for months and bought the book instantly after it was published. To my disappointment, this book is full of mistakes. (I am not talking about typing errors) The code samples seem written by people who don't understand Java at all. The books website only posted 4 errors.I feel the author hired some idiots to type the book for him, while he himself just gave the main ideas."
1,Is it that hard to be accurate?,"A recent look at Sybex's errata page shows that they are tracking the errors as they come in. I think it would make sense to publish this book in soft copy. Some readers are happy to provide corrections if they don't have to pay first to do it.Where certification is concerned, mistakes just raise anxiety. I want to know what's correct, not what the author thinks might be correct and would verify if only there was time to check the facts. I hope Sybex is good on refunds."
3,"Useful book, but too many errors","As of now (second edition, hardcover), the book is in a pretty bad shape. Numerous typographical and logical errors make it a very annoying occupation to read it and, especially, to use it to study for the Exam. Questions and answers of the review sections and mock-up exams are often poorly worded and sometimes flat-out wrong.Despite of its serious drawbacks, the book can be used productively (it helped me considerably to pass the Exam) since, in my view, it gives the reader an indication of the depth and breadth to which the exam will probe his/her knowledge. However, to benefit from the book in this way, the reader needs to be already familiar with the subject."
3,A good overview,I was pleased with the book even though there were a few errors (typo's and practice exams). It gave a good overview of what is on the test. I would recommend it. I just ordered the Manning book and will read that as well.
1,A Huge Disappointment,I guess this book was published in a big hurry under big demand. Not well organized; the statements are confusing; obvious errors all over the place; the review questions are not clear; even some answers are wrong! A huge disappointment to me.
2,Immature at the alter,Julia was much too immature and weak for my taste. Seems that Julia never faced with any real world challenges before marriage and didn't handle this one with one ounce of strength. That she figured it out in the end was too little too late. I am still not sure why reviews of this book are so high.
5,Amazing storyline,"What would you do if someone showed up at your wedding with a baby belonging to your significant other? This book is very entertaining and makes you question how you would cope? I think this author did a great job of showing how the hero, heroine, and even the wedding-crashing ex-lover changed/grew as the story progressed."
3,Enjoyable,"It was an enjoyable read, but tended to drag a bit. A bit angsty for my tastes, but still a pleasant few hours."
1,The unexpected wedding gift (his baby),I did not care for this book. There was too much turmoil and it was supposed to be a romance novel. The things that went on in this book was too much like real life and that 's not why I read these books.
2,more didg - less flute,"this cd is good, however, the flute dominates the music. needs more instumentals. like drums,nature sounds, anything but flute"
2,Impractical and disappointing,"As a high school teacher, I was hoping that this book would help my students feel more comfortable expressing themselves in poetry form and feel proud about displaying their work. I found that many of the activities would considered ""stupid"" by my students, and many activities are just too impractical when one considers the cost of materials for the number of students I have. The book also assumes that students already know how to write poetry, and there is no emphasis on the writing process or revision. Students go directly from freewriting to presentation. I've found my students have wonderful imaginations; they just don't know how to turn imagination into verse. This book won't help them do that."
5,Incredibly useful,I have used several adaptations of the recipes in this book at work and at home cooking for friends.The recipes are straight forward and don't require an incredible amount of skill. Your personal finesse will decide wiether you can execute them well or not as opposed to your skill level as in the case of most cook books.
5,WOW,"My 2 year old boy LOVES these shoes. He was so excited to put them on and spent the first hour running and jumping nonstop. It's still hot here (I got these for Fall) so I let him wear them without socks for their trial run and he didn't get rub marks. They look even better in person than online, have flexiblity in the toes where it counts, nice and light, and they're obviously comfortable for him. Sizing runs true."
3,My Cats and Fancy Feast,"I prefer using the smaller can sizes and I love not having to use a can opener. My cats (2) HAVE DIFERENT STANDARDS! I think in general they like their food but apparently have rules about how to eat it.I still am not sure what they like best, but it does seem to be foods in the fowl and beef depts.The sliced up meats with gravy are lapped up quickly But lapped up means they lick up the gravy and will leave the meat in the dish.I am going to keep buying Fancy Feast."
4,James Garvin obviously lacks imagination,I must take strong exception to James Garvin DC Something-or-other's review. He obviously lacks a sense of imagination and must suffer from concrete thinking. Those who subsequently reviewed this book (which I have been seeking under its original title since my copy was stolen in 1994) see beyond the historical contrivance to allow comparison of current dispersed management problems with those faced by other managers and leaders.The author has gone on to a successful career guided by the same concepts. This is a book recommended by other management leaders and enlightened readers.
4,Good fast read on the challenges of virtual leadership,"I highly recommend this book as an entertaining one on how to be a virtual leader. In the style of Lencioni's ""Five Dysfunctions of a Team"" it provides some very good points. Plus it is a quick read."
1,Steve Madden shoes stink,"I always do this.. give Steve Madden shoes a chance, when I know for a FACT that no matter what shoe I buy (sneakers excluded.. I love SM sneakers) they will definitely be unbearably uncomfortable. These shoes pinch my feet in an area that NO OTHER SHOE I'VE EVER WORN has pinched me before. I'd return them in a second if I didn't have to pay shipping... now I'll just have to sell them. Plus, the material is subpar -- thin and of cheap feeling quality.I tell myself this every time, but I am never buying Steve Madden shoes again!"
4,Plain Old Lens Cloth,"Nice utility lens cloth. It's a little less pliable than I'd hoped, but I don't think it's really unusual. I like it and use it and would buy it again."
5,70s disco reminder,"With the european TOP 40 hit ""King of Love"" the feelings and the Disco-Glamour of the 70s will flash again. Not without self-irony Thomas performs the ""King of Love"" in the new video to this dynamically song.A must-have for the Bee Gees fans!"
5,Scent of 70s,With the european TOP 40 hit the feelings and the Disco-Glamour of the 70s will flash again. Not without self-irony Thomas performs in the new video to this dynamically song.A must-have for the 70s disco fans!
1,no good.,"Me waan den Hard Hard Rasta.Me No waan dis batty.300,000,000 better albums out there.No mon, dem NEVER put dis pon dem ear-a-yaard.pure lie-dem. I an I never Hear dis man nametill I come abroad.I an I sight up the rhyddim twins name an we chekit.Mr Colorado was right. sad-but-trueMom and Dad just laughed and laughed."
1,Incomprehensible,"I am a lawyer and have spent most of my life reading, and had read many books on trading before I read this one. It looked like the holy grail, so the three or four key chapters, I read over and over trying to determine 3 simple things: Where to buy/sell short, where to place the stop loss, where to exit the trade. I confess, I was never able to determine that, from the text, although the author seems to assume that he has made that clear to the reader."
1,trading chaos,"Delivery is on time as promise, book is in great cond. Great seller. Thank you! Will do business again."
1,Donate your money to charity,"In the first few chapters, he sounds so attractive, after that, you will find the author using new technical analysis words to describe the breakthrough of the resistance/support and claims this a new concept/idea, but he saying nothing on the book and if you are using his method to trade, you are not far from bankruptcy.Eventually, you waste your money, then why don't send cheque to charities."
1,The book has the wrong title!,"I was greatly disappointed with this book. One would think it is about chaos theory and its applications for the financial markets, but all it has on the subject is one page of text! When I read the book, I had a strong feeling that the author didn't know what he was talking about when it came to chaos, and that's why he had so little to say. If you really want to get familiar with chaos theory and how it can help analyze the markets, your best bet is Peters' ""Chaos and Order in the Financial Markets"". Better yet, if you have some mathematical background, ""Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics in the Financial Markets"" by R.Trippi offers some serious discussion on the subject."
5,Joke,"The five stars is only for the cover. However, the content of the book is pathetic. I have read many trading books and several chaos books and I can honestly say this book is neither. I fell for the enlightened self-similar structure cover and wasted my money. Don't repeat my mistake.If you are interested in chaos and trading, start with Edgar Peters books such as Chaos and the Capital Markets.The publisher, Wiley, should be ashamed to put out this sort of drivel. Bill Williams is a joke. If you think your trading style is based on your body type, then maybe this book will help you feel better about losing; otherwise skip it and Bill Williams, PhD.'s other lobotomized treatises on trading."
2,Too good to be true,"Sorry to say, this one's a disappointment. What do you want do? Make money, or read something that seems to offer a mystical solution. If the latter go ahead and buy it, though I doubt whether you will make any money consistently from the ideas. Is the author well intentioned? Probably, but then so is everyone in the how to get rich quick industry. If you bought this book out of greed then you will get what you deserve. I think far more is to be learned from a classic like Reminiscences Of a Stock Operator than this. The title is a lure as far as I could tell, having almost nothing to do with chaos in any deep way. But who knows, good ideas come from all sorts of strange sources."
1,Total Waste of Time,"This book is a total waste of time. The author makes no attempt to explain chaos theory other than to say is is a new way to look at information. The author should be ashamed of using the word chaos in the title of this book. His big claim to fame is saying he discovered the ""Elliot Wave Fractal."" The actual strategy is nothing more than a trend following system using 4 lagged moving averages and some simple rules.ps - His second book is not much more than a copy of this one with a few new paragraphs."
1,DON'T BUY THIS NECKLACE!!,"This necklace is tiny, it's very poorly made and I haven't worn it once since receiving it in the mail. It may look pretty on here but believe me, you will be very disappointed."
3,Totally fun pulp,"Lots of gore and a passable knowledge of occultism in general. This is a fun book, but is not the epic horror great I had hoped it would be. Still, it's a good, fun trashy mindless read. Reminds me of what a vampire novel by Jim Thompson might be like."
2,The book was interesting but easy.,I found the book really interesting and life like. It really had a real life feel to it. I thought that this book was a pretty easy book. I really liked the ending it had a typical ending.
1,not what I thought it would be,"I thought this cd would be great but I was very disappointed with Randy Johnston playing. His ideas were very repetitive, and at times his playing was not very clean. I enjoyed Joey DeFrancesco"
4,burning up for your love,"this album is a precious thing - redolent of that perfect despair you felt when you first realized people lie, loved ones disappear and friends disappoint more often than not, and -- suddenly, you didn't care. brew up a nice cup of your favorite poison, sink into that old morris chair you wish were real (and not just a cheap repro) and put on ""the horrible cocoanut grove disaster."" it's perfect for reading flannery o'connor, martin amis or certain books of the bible. kisses to gartman & co. for understanding the importance of beauty, subtlety and finesse."
4,this is a very powerful album,"it's amazing how something can be so understated and yet so emotionally sublime. this album heals. somehow Gartman's voice becomes my own. listening to this album when I was alone, has always invoked the pleasant uncanny feeling that I was never truly alone. the songs, the overarching tone, all seem to accompany you and suffer alongside you. there are no great gasps of air and dramatic curtain calls, just aching mentions of longing and hurt. new england weather and unrequited glances. I was genuinely surprised to see this album here, as I capriciously purchased it from an indie record shop in NYC, but I'm glad the word is getting around, because it's lovely."
5,A Wonderful Book With An Important Message,"In Vive La Paris, a precocious fifth grader named Paris is frustrated and angry that her older brother is being bullied by a girl from Paris's class. Paris can't understand why her brother doesn't hit her back. With the help of her elderly piano teacher, Mrs. Rosen, and her fifth grade teacher, Miss Pointy, Paris learns some very important life lessons about tolerance, the dangers of ignorance, and how we each play an important role when it comes to facing and addressing the injustices we see in the world. This is a powerful story that is beautifully written. I highly recommend it!"
4,Vive La Paris By Anna,"Vive La Paris is the sequel to Sahara Special and it is about Paris' life. I liked the first book, Sahara Special, but Vive La Paris is much better because it has things people can connect to. But to understand Vive la Paris you have to read Sahara special.Vive La Paris is about Paris who just wants to take piano lessons, not Paris lessons! This is one of my favorite books. I would give it 4 and a half stars out of 5."
2,Themes are too sad for me,"This CD was recommended to me, so I bought it without hearing any of it. The music may be ok, but the themes of the songs are about loss of love and sadness and being lonely. Not something I really want to listen to.This is just a personal taste thing."
1,Cultural fusion at its garbled worst.,"As a student of Japanese culture, this book depressed me. The contents bear no more relation to the true spirit of ""wabi"" and ""sabi"" than does a chrome Sony Diskman. The book's core sensibility is mediocre, middle-American interior design thinly coated with a layer of Japanese cliches. What made me very sad was the complete misuse/misundertanding of the important aesthetic terms ""wabi"" and ""sabi."" The tipoff is in the title. Wabi and sabi can never be a ""style"" in the Martha Stewart home decorating sense. (Although I'm sure Martha Stewart would have at least made a beautiful, if not intellectually honest, book.) Wabi-sabi is NOT a style or, as the authors maintain, something akin to feng shui. This book is an example of cultural fusion at its worst. Not recommended."
2,Dumbing down wabi-sabi.,"Will ""wabi-sabi"" become the new buzzword among corporate retailers and mall mongers? That seems to be the authors' intention. They attempt to transform an elegant and rarified sense of beauty into corporate easy speak: high bulk, low content. The authors' flawed methodology is to take a mishmash of things Japanese and, by association, assume it's wabi-sabi. They haven't done their homework."
3,The Story Is Hard To Follow,"Hi, This is Malamasomei, your number one guide to finding good manga and anime.This book has the same good story as the first, but isn't what I consider it's sequel. This book makes very little sense until the end, and although the art work is good, it just doesn't compare to the first.I would recomend this for the art, but the story is very difficult to follow, and I don't think that it is as wise of a purchase.Visit my Profile for further information"
2,The Embarrassing Black Sheep Of The GITS Works,"I am a self-admitted G.I.T.S. fanboy; I even enjoy Ghost In the Shell: Innocence. Keep that in mind when I say that I hate this book. I've read it three times now, over the span of 5 years, and it still makes absolutely no sense.It's true that this is some of Shirow's finest art, and his color work is at its peak here. It's got a perty mouth, so to speak, but all the words that exit it are incomprehensible techno-babble that, while they develop the world that Shirow has created, might as well be ones and zeros. Ninety percent of this book is hacker-speak between two two A.I. entities.Do not allow this book to turn you off from the Ghost In The Shell universe, as there are countless wonderful sotries that have been told in that universe; This is simply not one of them."
3,"It's Shirow, come on","I remember buying this and reading it once and being disappointed. The first one was way better, and while this one explores some interesting ideas, I don't think it is nearly as ground breaking as it wants to be. The art is fantastic, Shirow has really polished his skills, but really it's a girly magazine. If you just read it for what it is, you'll enjoy it on a go around, but only if you can stomach manga after the vomitous upsurge of swill that's hit our coast and poisoned the minds of so many kids. I'm not as into the stuff as I used to be, just kinda grew out of it. Even as manga goes, there is way better in the genre. But hey, it's shirow, you buy it for the art. If you want a good story, just watch the first movie and the stand alone stuff. The PS2 game is great too. Otherwise, the guy is a porno painter."
2,The only one?,"I might be the only one but my biggest turn off was not the convoluted story , but the art. His hand drawn back and white art in the middle was amazing as always, but the digital environments used in so much of the book just did not look good. It all looked like screenshots from a badly rendered CGI movie that had people drawn over top of it. It just looked bad. Now, I admit two things. One, the digital art looked EXCELLENT for the scenes that took place in the Net. It would have been incredible he had drawn more in the B&W; style of the first GitS and then CG'ed the Net parts. Anyway the second thing is that I am definitely in the minority with my opinions on the art, and its very possible I am just missing something or being plain ignorant.Either way, I bought this volume based on everyone's ravings about how good the art was, and it was my a big let down. So this is my counter-point to the other reviews."
4,Ghost in the Shell Volume 2: Man-Machine Interface,"Well this book is set four years after the events in the original ""Ghost in the Shell"" but, it was created 10 years after the first one. So while Shirow discusses many of the themes present in the first work, the look is completely different. His style has become crisper and at times almost baroque in the density of details he can place into an image. For me it was visual overload a few times and took me awhile to process this book. Themes in this book are similar to the other works in the Ghost in the Shell franchise: identity, technology, privacy, society and so on. This would not be the best place to start with the Ghost in the Shell series but if you're already in their universe then this another excellent addition."
3,Ditto,"The art and graphics are wonderful but the story is difficult to stay into, if you like hot manga chicks with wild sci fi visuals get this but just expect the story to be very dense."
5,Much more abstract than the first one,The second GITS manga is kinda what the second movie was to the first. Much closer to the TV series too.
3,author misrepresents the value of his book,"Helpful lists of possible questions, generally common sense advice anyone can read in any similar book, energetic style and no nonsense advice about dress code and being late and conversation style.This book needs to be updated. Selection interviews happen after the screening and the screening interviews depend on your networking and well written resumes, one general resume and several resumes adjusted according to the position you apply for.The author misrepresented the value of this book, because it is not different from lots and lots of other book on the market about the most painful experience being interviewed and rejected. Every serious job seeker knows basics, if the person is not serious nothing will help."
3,Pretty Good But . . .,"Generally good advice but some odd strays from mainstream advice that I don't agree with. For example, it argues against thank you letters after an interview - says that they are an irritant to interviewer. Personally, I have been involved with hiring plenty of people and a well written thank you never hurts and can make a difference in a close call."
3,"Nice pillow, but...","One should be aware that this is a regular standard size pillow. Nothing special in it to be qualified as a ""baby"" pillow."
3,It's a regular polyester pillow,"This is not particularly sized for a toddler. It's just a regular polyester-filled pillow. Although there's nothing wrong with it and the price isn't way out of whack (Moonlight tends to sell up), it's a bit thick for my nearly 3 year old. The Pacific Coast toddler pillow might fit better but I may never know."
3,Pretend Marriage leads to falling in love,"Interesting book about the lives of hotel consultants. Austin Hughes is happily single, but he needs to be married to travel on business to West Africa. Desiree Mack happily accepts being that she loves her job and this gives her a chance to show the big boss what she is made of. She does everything to resist, but finds herself drawn to him and does not want to put her career in jeapordy by crossing the line.I feel the book could have gone a little deeper about the sabatoge of his busines. All in all this books is a good read."
4,Out of Time,"I wish the falling numerals were a little thicker, not just paint, and if you count, there is an extra number ""1"" :) By the way, the clock is transparent, which is not obvious on the picture. Overall this is a very good design and would make a perfect gift."
3,"Some Hot,Some Fair Dixieland","This CD contains three excellent selections by Sharkey and his Kings of Dixieland, including""Panama"", and three by George Girard,including ""San"". The other selections lack the energy and expertise of these two traditional bands. Paul Barbarin has been better. Still a good addition to a New Orleans jazz collection."
4,Great Single Player - Multi-Player Lacks,"I thought this was one of the best first person shooters in single player mode. In fact, I would say it is the second best single player FPS next to Half-Life. I was totally immerged into the single player game and thought it was nothing short of outstanding.Multi-player however lacked in my opinion. Player movement speed online was way too fast for the game. I thought the online play should of been more realistic feeling, perhaps similair to the popular Counter-Strike Half-Life modification.If you like single player FPS games, this is a must buy."
4,Realism combined with graphic violence,"If you manage to make it past all of the ""mature audiences"" warnings, you'll find an absorbing, heart-pounding and altogether impressive game. Not for the faint of heart, there hasn't been a shooter that's made me afraid to turn corners like this since Wolfenstein 3D."
5,Great fun!,And its has just the right amount of violence too! The game's GHOUL engine really does a great job displaying realistic damage effects and gunshot wounds. I enjoy playing this again and again!
5,Awesome Game,I playd the game in 2000 when it was released and was surprised.The platinum edition includes all pathes and the platinum mappack.
4,Soldier of Fortune,This game has a good plot. There a medium amount of missions. The graphics could be improved. The Gold Edition is the best version because various bugs on levels were fixed. If you already have Soldier of Fortune just download the Gold Edition patch.
1,One of the Worst Games Yet,"It is one of the most primitive fpc games in a while. The enemies are as dumb as bricks, running straight toward you every time firing at you. The graphics are no where close to current standards more like the standard of the old Duke Nukem 3D game. The weaponfire is the most unrealistic of any fpc I have played(that's quite a few). Even the gore is fake looking and really unnecessary if you ask me. Don't waste your money on this game unless you need something to go under the leg of a table to balance it or something. This game is misrepresented by it's description as it says you are a cia agent using stealth and strategy when all you do is run and shoot the whole time. Avoid this game like the plague."
1,one word: GORE,"It has been awhile since I played this, I have the PS2 version and I I bet you could get a used copy for about 99 cents. This is probably the most violent game I have ever played. There is a violence lock in the game that can let you control whether dismembered limbs or blood are allowed. If you turn everything on, you have one big goreapalooza. This game goes beyond mature. Dont let the kids get there hands on this!"
3,An Average game,"I have just been playing the demo of SOF and I must say that I am a bit dissapointed. The graphics date back almost to the old Duke Nukem 3d game style graphics, not anywhere close to current standards. The weapon fire is the most unrealistic I have ever seen in a FPC. The storyline is good and the playability is good, but it could have been so much better if the graphics were worth a flip, but they're not, but it is a fun game nonetheless, and for the cheap price it's going at now, should be worth the money, but I would never pay full price for a game the lacks as much graphically as this one does."
3,Soldier of Fortune,"The first time I played this game at my friend's house I could not stand the violence, it was disgusting and really offensive so I played most of the game with a parental lock (Which allows you to take blood and everything you find offensive out) which is a good point of the game... Other wise it was pretty good and extremely realistic, with all the body motions and details etc... I do think one of the downs about this game is that there are bearly any decent puzzles or anything, I mean it's basically a go around and shoot the heck out of everybody and till there is no more living and then that's it, level complete, kinda boring... Well I don't think I'll buy this game but hopefully the company who designed Soldier of Fortune (Activision) will learn from their mistakes and come up with a Soldier of Fortune 2 which'll be 10 times as good..."
1,OK game,"I wouldn't really actually know. i orderred it 2 months ago and still havn't gotten it. i thought it would be cool, but i have yet to even see the box. i say i want a reffund."
4,Pokemon V.Trainer IS COOL,"Hello!I got this in the summer.I hate to admit I have only won one battle!But,I just recently recieved a Brock pak that includedBlastoise and Regirock I think.Buy it"
2,Must Have Two,This toy is no fun unless you have two and you hook them together and fight a friend. I bought another one for the neighbor to use - but the boys still lost interest within a week.
1,Booooorrrriiiinnnnggg,"My 6-year-old Pokemon enthusiast was very disappointed with this toy. And we bought two of them so Dad could play too. It's unbelievably boring. And we bought two extra packs of characters, which unfortunately the kids at the party opened so I can't return any of it. HUGE waste of money."
4,Okay...,"This toy is kinda exciting once you open it for the first time,but after a few weeks,it could get boring.Also,if you have parents that can't afford $10.00 on a figure pack then I suguest you not to buy this item!"
1,Junk,"This toy is junk. I had very low expectations given it's cost, but I was still disappointed. Take your kid out for ice cream instead of buying this toy."
3,Maybe not the best toy for a 6 year old!,My son is 6 he also has the pokemon pokedex which he enjoys. This game was just a little hard for him to understand.
5,Jay Bezel is a BEAST!!!,"Last night I was board out of my mind so I decided to look for some music for my iPod. At first I found nothing in the vast sea of music amazon has to offer and then I stumbled over to this cd on accident and decided to listen to it. From the git-go the tracks had my head boppin'. I didn't even know who or about Jay Bezel at the time, REALLY there's only one word defines this guy and this album... FIRE!!!!!!! I highly recommend this album."
4,A wonderfully demented little coffee table book,"As an Emily (obviously) who has had multiple black cats in my lifetime, I was immediately drawn to this darkly funny little book. I think Emily's individualism and uniqueness stand out above her vaguely sinister actions; she is simply a girl refuses to live her life as expected. It's a wonderful gift book for any teenage or adult Emilys - or anyone with the spirit of Emily the Strange."
4,Wonderfully Creepy,"Emily the Strange is a brief and funny biography of Emily, a rather....odd little girl who doesn't just break rules; she breaks hearts. The illustrations went perfectly with the dark mood of the book. However, the story did not have much plot; it was basically a summary of Emily's life. I believe that to know more about Emily, one has to read the other books in the series. Despite the fact that this picture book is more for adults than for children, it has a quirky, goth-y charm that will definitely be appreciated."
4,A captivating portrait of the post-modern goth girl,"Those who appreciate top-notch graphic art of the near minimalist variety need not look no further then this well designed little hardcover that delves into the life and sinister mind of America's new favorite 13-year-old gloom girl, Emily: The Strange. While the actual book itself will take no longer then 3 minutes or so to read through, the high quality of artistic design as well as the pseudo zen-like quips and narrative will have you going back to the beginning and absorbing it through again and again."
2,Good but why is it short,OK first off I did somewhat like it but I have been hearing about this series for years now and with the movie being announced I ordered the books. They are short and most pages don't even have words. I was expect more of a graphic novel and less of a children's book.
1,Not What I Expected,"This book was not what I expected. It was made more like a childrens book than a novel. It had a sentence per page and some nifty pictures but no real depth or info about Emily. Yes, it did bring across that Emily is strange, anti-social, and has a cat posse, but other than that it really wasn't worth the money."
1,Children's format not appropriate for nihilist indulgence,"I got a copy of this at a garage sale for my six year old daughter Emily, who is quite wonderfully strange. The title and picture book format gave me the impression that the character Emily would be eccentric. Instead, it was pretty hideous and I'm truly sorry that my Emily read it and was horrified before I had the chance to look it over. It may be someone's cutesy art school prank, but you should recognize that people will be drawn to it for children because of its format, and that it's not appropriate for small children."
1,Celebrate treating others poorly,"This book celebrates poor treatment.. including treating yourself poorly. OK.. so you are different. Are you different just like the thousands of others who bought this book and believe their way to rebel is to shoot yourself and others in the foot? This book celebrates hurting boys, old ladies, dogs, and yourself. Can Emily think of no other way to express herself? It's OK to feel dark thoughts. But is it OK to celebrate depression and anger? Celebrate difference. Celebrate uniqueness. But shame on the author who can offer nothing better than this."
1,felt cheated,I bought this book expecting something cool new. What i got was just a half hazard collection of tee shirt designs put together. I felt cheated as an Emily fan.
1,Very Disappointing,"This book was not at all what I expected. I went to the book store to find it because of all the high reviews it got. But I found it rather boring and very uncreative. One review said it read like a children's book, but it wasn't even that good. There was no story. It took just a minute to read and it read like a poorly thought out short poem. If you are looking for something with a interesting story, you will not find it in this book. I still have one question. Why do so many people like this book? That in itself is strange."
3,Not complete,"I enjoyed some of the stories and some I didn't. But that's the way it is with collections of short stories. I was not disturbed by any of the stories, although I should have read the Amazon reviews before picking up the book as I was not at all prepared for what was coming. But the stories and the feelings of lust and loss were very intersting. I just didn't feel that any of the characters were developed fully. The first story, The Strangers at the Palazzo D'Oro was the best in my opinion. I always enjoy stories that are told from the perspective of the main character looking back on their life. I just wish there would've been a little more to it. Sex gets old when there's not more dialogue and plot."
4,OK,"I thought the cd was good,but I can only take soo much of Elighs flow. After awhile I'm just like ""uhhhh, I cant take this anymore"".Not that he cant rap extremely well, but on this cd it just starts to get tiring.I also did not like the fact that he had a song dedicated to smoking marijuana either."
3,hidden marketing,"my grandaughter is crazy about Diego and enjoys the DVD. I however have a serious problem with the fact that once you start it, it will not let you access the menu. Your child must sit through 4 or 5 ads for other DVDs unless you want to stay there and manually skip each one. It also won't let you stop the DVD during this time. That is a marketing ploy I very much resent."
1,SCRATCHED and NEVER worked!!!!,I received this DVD and it was totally scratched on the back. Never worked. Very dissapointed and a total loss of my money.
3,just so so,My liitle guy loves Diego and fish so I thought this would be a sure fire winner. Maybe my expectations were too high...not the very best episode. We will order a few others in hopes they are better.
5,Go Diego Go Underwater Mystery,My son just loves this video. Diego and the other characters speak clearly and the scene is understandable for a little one.
2,Doesn't show accurate temp,"This thermometer is pretty in the picture, but upon arrival, it turned out to be a cheap piece of plastic! It seems about 5 degrees too cold and it doesn't come with any instructions on what to do if it's not reading correctly. Not worth the money. I'm still debating whether to deal with the hassle of returning it. Also delivered a day later than the expected date."
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK,"This thing is a pieceof crap. It is off by 10 degrees. Just went to put it up todayand realized it was not accurate, but am beyond the return date by a few days. Don't order one. It is junk. Did I mention it is a piece of crap??????"
4,Great starter kit,Pros:Great starter package.Wide range of colors.Comes with small pet boardsCons:Inconsistent amount of beads per color. You will get tons of one color and literally beads 2 of some other colors.Peg boards are too small to do any useful project. Consider buying the interlocking peg boards when you get this.Does not contain dark gray. Does not contain enough black. I recommend buying a bag of each of those before you start.
3,Incompatible with my other perler beads,"Something about ""Fun Fusion"" is funky. I thought these looked almost identical to my other perler beads, which have the same logo but without the ""Fun Fusion"" brand, and when I combined beads, the Fun Fusion ones melted a lot faster, creating funky beading. This really ticked me off, and I won't be using them. However, if you use these beads solely you'd probably be okay.At least I got some pegboards."
2,Not great.,"First, this toy is NOT made in the United States, as indicated. I purchased it for my daughter but it is much too intricate. The tiny beads do not stay on the forms at all. A much older child would need to successfully complete the project. I ended up with hundreds of tiny bead all over the floor - and ultimately in my vacuum."
5,Hours of fun.,This item shipped quickly and has provided hours of fun for my 3 children. Even my 3 year old twins make items. It helps with their hand eye coordination! There is nothing like making Christmas ornaments in June!
1,"Like everyone else said, IS NOT A DYSON replacement","Just looking at it in the box, I knew it wasn't going to work. The filter is too big to fit my DC07, and it looks like it cannot be removed to clean. It also has a protrusion where my original filter doesn't have any. Will be sending this back.Such a bummer because my lifetime filter disintegrated and I need to vacuum."
3,falls a little short...,"I've used it twice over the years for a bible study. I do wish it were a little meatier, and that he didn't use his own paraphrased translation for the scripture text. Not enough meat for a good thorough bible study, but rather nice little meditations on each of the psalms. I like the overall premise and structure - looking at the psalms of ascents as a unified group which parallels the pilgrimage to the temple at Jerusalem and our own spiritual journey, but it is forced in places, and light in other places, and tedious in still other places. But Im not going to get rid of the book, I like having it on my bookshelf, to take down and read a chapter from now and then. Just don't expect a masterpiece."
4,Well Done,This recording is well done. The material is read with clarity and is pleasant to listen to. I was very well pleased with this product.
5,A Long Obedience in the Same Direction,"A wonderful book full of insight and points that the Christian should ponder. The Christian faith is one of a journey, and this book will help you along that path."
3,Good Content,I found this book to have some really good content but it was just hard to keep interested in it. I didn't end up finishing it.
3,Not as linear as the title would suggest,"Peterson wrote A Long Obedience in the Same Direction thirty years ago and it's fifteen chapters are based on the Songs of Ascents (Psalms 120-134), Psalms that were most likely sung as Jewish pilgrims made their ascent to Jerusalem for their holy feast days.Each chapter begins with one of the fifteen Psalms in The Message translation which provides the framework for the chapter. In fact, it was actually the work done during the writing of this book that, as Eugene says, ""provided the impetus for embarking on the new translation"".This form is at times refreshing and at other times distracting. Refreshing because it reads a bit like an expository sermon, dealing with the text as it is written and in sequence, chapter by chapter. Distracting because, as far as a book on discipleship goes, it doesn't have a simple list of logical steps to follow. But, after all, when does discipleship ever work like that?"
1,better way,This old standby has long been the edge clamp of choice due to the lack of a better way. If compared to the new Pony 3- way edging spring clamp I believe you will quickly realize it is obsolete. Try both and see for yourself!
5,Most mature multi-system gaming magazine.,"First off, the artwork and pictures and screenshots in here, are worth the price of admission alone. It's fantabolous, and really borders on art. The covers are like more than art. They could be framed. They work on a letter grading scale. That's A-F, including the plusses and minuses, but of course, not for the F's. Play is a very good title, because not only do they cover games, but also Anime, DVD's, and Music; all of which can be played. If you get gaming magazine ever, this has to be it. But like most everyone else, they can be a bit late in running reviews, and sometimes they get exclusives or first reviews too. I hope this review helped expose you to this work of art. But please, dont buy on here. You are sooooooooooooo getting ripped off. The price of a regular subscription is $20, so see if you can find a copy on the newstand somewhere, or even go to www.popcultureshock/play and subscribe there."
3,"Great layouts, decent writing","Play Magazine is the last bastion of hope for the hardcore gamer.Nobody loves their games as much as the guys who write Play. They live, eat, and breathe videogames. They probably sleep in videogame character sheets. These guys care about games and where the games industry is heading. This, in the end, is the greatest and worst aspect of the magazine.Because of their undying love for games, the writers often come across as amateurish fanboys who would give five stars to anything with ""Sega"" or ""Treasure"" on the box. They also seem incapable of giving any game a bad grade, giving many poor games, accepted industry-wide as insults to the medium, average or even above average marks.But if you take the time to sift through the reviews, you'll find the most passionate coverage of video games and the gamer lifestyle of any magazine."
3,Missing book,The add showed a discovery guide that go with the DVD. It is hard to do the study without the guide
4,Studebaker John And The Hawks - Cool Blues Out Of Chicago,"Studebaker John Grimaldi is a long time veteran of the Chicago blues scene, but this is the first album I have checked out by him. John plays a mean harmonica, tasty guitar, sings and writes all of the songs. I am quite impressed with the guy and this is a solid blues rock album. Some of his more party oriented stuff reminds me of The Fabulous Thunderbirds, but those tracks tend to be the weaker ones on the album. John plays some fantastic slide guitar on several tracks and his harmonica playing often reminds me of Greg ""Fingers"" Taylor. All in all this is a very nice modern blues album by a relatively unknown Chicago area talent."
5,The Original Trombone King at his Best,"Swinging and full of life, this Kid Ory album is a little known classic. One of the original sidemen to Louis Armstrong's Hot Fives and Sevens, Ory here shows why he is the king of 'bone players, breaking into that old time, downhome New Orleans style that made him famous. Ory's interpretations of classics like ""Creole Love Call,"" and ""Bill Bailey"" are memorable, as are his rarely heard vocal stylings. A great album, guaranteed to conjure thoughts of an era now long gone."
3,miffy at the zoo,The book is ok. I was disappointed it didn't have a lion because on the tv show you see the lion several times.
4,little leauge baseball,"this is a great game you can play as your basic kid-self, while playing all over the world."
5,A brilliant book to understand stalinism,"Tony Cliff's book ""State Capitalism in Russia"" first published in 1947.. When the stalinizm in ""golden age"" after the II. War... He shows why we must describe stalinst Russia as ""state capitalist"" country.. And also he shows the alternative: Socialism from below.."
3,wanted more,"I really was hoping for more with this book. Some background to the symbolism, but very light on the interesting stories. I have better information on my website."
1,Disappointment,This book promotes the misuse of intimacy. It would not be an enjoyable read for a teen with Christian values. It's disappointing that a book such as this gives the impression that most teens have friends with benefits.
5,"Loved it, very well done","A true story by a true patriot. An excellent account of the life and times in south Georgia, from the beginings of WWII thru Vietnam, as lived by a true blue American driven to do what's right and just. A time in our country's history that should never be forgotten. Reds teaches us that you must be true to your beliefs, believe in yourself, keep your friends close and voice your opinion when it matters most. Your gut feeling is not always the most popular, and sometimes there are consequences.May your skies always be blue, the wind at your back, and your landings soft. Your brother of the silk. AIRBORNE!"
4,Mucho Excitement,"the author has captivatingly told an exciting story. My 17 year old son also couldn't put it down and learned about history without ""school"". I highly recommend this book."
5,excellent story,"I MET THE AUTHOR IN SAVANNAH RECENTLY AND BOUGHT THIS BOOK AT A SIGNING. I FOUND THE BOOK TO BE WELL WRITTEN AND THE STORY LINE VERY INSTERESTING. MR HELMEY IS A GREAT STORY TELLER AND KEEPS YOUR INTEREST RIGHT UP TO THE END. WHEN I BOUGHT THE BOOK I WAS REAL CURIOUS ABOUT THE TITLE, BUT DIDN'T WANT TO ASK. I HOPED IT WOULD BE EXPLAINED IN THE TELLING OF THE STORY AND IT WAS. I MUST ADMIT ALTHOUGH I GREW UP IN THE TIMES HE IS WRITING ABOUT, BUT I LED A VERY SHELTERED LIFE. I AM THANKFUL THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE WILLING TO PUT THEIR LIFE ON THE LINE FOR OUR COUNTRY."
5,GREAT MAN!! GREAT BOOK!!,"As I was taking in Savannah's St. Patty's Day festivities I came across a sign for a book signing. I followed the arrows and came across and older gentleman with some books outside an art gallery. He introduced himself as ""the only man in U.S. aviation history to hijack a plane and be found not guilty of it."" At that moment I knew I had to read his book. And WOW!!! It was worth it!!! I could not put it down. The story of this man's life is simply amazing. The ups and downs he endured are like nothing anyone would think possible for any one man. I would recommend this book to anyone. And I'm not just saying this because he is one of the nicest guys I have ever met. The book is awesome!!!"
5,"Entertaining, Spellbounding","Wow!!! What a spellbounding and entertaining story. Once I picked it up I did not want to put it down. The Lemon Dance has everything a good book should have; drama, mystery, historical events and humor. Page after page was nothing short of entertainment. I am a Savannahian and can relate to some of the senes noted in the book. I am also previledged to be the author's neighbor. And even though I live next door to Reds Helmey, I never knew he lived such an interesting life until I read the book. Can't wait until the movie comes out."
2,Fitting is too tight,"I bought this cap for my 1997 Lexus LX450 because it has the release tap. The fitting is very bad and it takes a while to make it fit. I should have bought the regular cap.UPDATE: It doesn't work, may be the pressure cap is not right for the LX450 and caused overheating. I ended up using my regular cap & it's okay now."
2,Very disappointed with this product,"I survived for over a decade using very basic wine glasses from the Crate & Barrel outlet (I think I paid less than $2 per unit?). I put them in the dishwasher and broke one every year or two. Over time my stock became depleted so I decided to upgrade to these glasses. Within the first month I had already broken two -- on one, the stem broke in half in my hand while I was washing it (!!!). The glasses are very pretty, but I don't find them to be more durable than others that are out there and for that reason would not recommend paying the premium price. They are not that good.Separately, the company etches a white logo into the base of each glass. It's distracting and unattractive."
2,thin stems,"The stem on this glass is very thin. In fact, washing them carefully before their first use, one snapped. After using them for the first time, again, one snapped, this time while carefully drying. Won't buy any more wine glasses that I can't handle in advance."
1,Thank You REVIEWERS,"I just want to thank all of you reviewers for taking the time to review these wine glasses honestly. I, too, wondered why ALL of the reviews on WineEnthusiast were so positive on the Fusions. I was so excited and was absolutely going to order them because of it! I searched amazon just to see if they would be any less expensive and found all your reviews. So thank you for saving me the money I was going to foolishly spend. Oh, and I also have three cheap, but beautiful, floral etched glasses from Crate & Barrel that I've had for nearly 15 years. I started with four and one broke a few years ago. They feel thin and seem like the glass is the type that would really cut the heck out of you if it broke on you so I'm very careful. But, they have survived three moves and much wine drinking. Anyway, thanks again folks!"
1,Out of Date,Amazon.com should discontinue this book. I got it for Christmas and it is hopelessly out of date. It was published in 2003 and geared for the 1.1 version of Openoffice. The 3.0 version has been released.
2,In desperate need of revision,"I bought the Kindle edition of this book, so I don't know whether my comments apply to the paper version. I found the book to be hopelessly out of date and misleading at many points. One glaring example is the omission of Base; the book even states that OOo doesn't include a database application! The author uses MS Office XP as the basis for comparison, for heaven's sake. Both suites have undergone major revisions since this was published. I would have expected a corresponding updating of the book. Very disappointed."
2,Out of Date Manual,As a newcomer to Open Office I thought this book may be useful but I found it out of date.
2,Who is the Dummie?,"I was very disappointed in the OpenOffice for Dummies. I was specifically looking for the ""Base"" portion of OpenOffice and it was not mentioned at all.I also purchased OpenOffice 3 and the information I wanted was included, although not in as friendly text as I expected the Dummies to be."
3,Not as in depth as I would have liked,Should be more in depth....and along with another reviewer I would like to see more in depth books covering the individual applications...such as the spreadsheet and presentation applications....Have not had much time to read the whole book but I was not very impressed with the spreadsheet section.....although it is helpfull....I was hoping for more detailed and in depth help....
1,disgiusted,I thought I was ordering openoffice 3.2 but I received 3.1 which is unacceptable to me.A real letdown.
5,Awsome!,An amazing piece of filmaking and a must see. The performance of a lifetime for all three main actors. Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD
4,a good solid story about friendship,"On the surface the story is about Brooklyn and about ""made men"" but ultimately its about family...the ones you choose and the bonds of friendship. All the characters in this film are well chosen and the acting is genuine. An engaging film from beginning to end; I highly recommend it."
3,The Sopranos but without the wry humour or the depth of pathos,"This run-of-the-mill mob-wars centred movie is about as formulaic and predictable as it possible to be without actually being a complete copy of something else. ""Brooklyn Rules"" uses a standard mix of foul language, NY American-Italian patois, stock shock scenes of gratuitous violence, tacky casual sex scenes and formulaic black humour to re-tell every other coming-of-age-in-Brooklyn/escape-versus-stay-true-to-your-roots tale that has ever been told. Even its setting in the 1980s feels like nothing more that a cheap trick to make the production appeal to those of an age to be nostalgic for those years.So, if you have a hankering to be reminded of such things as Cabbage Patch Dolls, Atari computers and assassination attempts on the Pope, and have never seen a mob movie before, this film may just be the ticket. Anyone else, however, will probably feel that they've seen it all before somewhere. And mostly better done."
5,Don't read this alone!,Great book the first and second book! Gives ya chills and spooky enough to wanna leave the light on at night! I highly recommend.
2,Chopped & Cheesey,"I remember watching the Red Skelton show when I was a kid and I suppose I was simply hoping to see re-runs. This DVD is inexpensive and you get about what you pay for. The quality is low. In one respect, we can expect that since video recording at the time of the original airing was primitive. Meanwhile, the DVD looks like it was put together using equally primitive techniques. Unless you take control and skip around, you will have to see snippets of the same scenes over and over. The way the main content is edited, I don't think we really get a feel for the way the show really came off on live TV. In the midsts of the skits, monologues and other material in the show, Red was carrying on a tangental dialog with the audience that is only glimpsed in the 'best of' editing. I would rather see whole episodes, warts and all, versus stilted snippets."
2,itchy afterwards,"My scalp was itchy from time to time but nothing severs. I thought to try the shampoo after reading all the reviews. Well it arrived new, fast & as described. When I went to use it, my scalp felt very dry & itchy afterwards. I thought maybe it was to get worse to get better so I used it a 2nd time and it made my scalp start to flake! Ok that's it I stopped using it."
1,nothing just a regular shampoo,"This did not work at all, I used to use proactiv anti acne and dandruf and I had a couple of acne on my scalp but after a week of using this shampoo my scalp looks like strawberry, lots of itchy acne, I switched back to proactiv and I am getting better."
2,Little Value for the High Cost,"I was very shocked by the small size of the shampoo bottle - less than half the size of a normal shampoo bottle, especially for the high cost. When I buy something that seems way over priced, I expect to receive my money's worth, and when I don't get my money's worth, I feel as though I was taken by a snake-oil salesman. There's no way to tell if the product actually works or not after just 1 bottle, but I'm not willing to try it again."
3,Quick! QuickBooks Premier Contractor Edition 2003,"An interesting introduction to Accounting software. I had been using quicken and the jump in user knowledge needed was tremendous. Intuit is decidedly unsupportive when it comes to product instructions and support and I will be looking elsewhere for my next software package. It is possible that I will use continue to use QB but I would reccomend that new QB users start out with a less expensive version. The ""more accurate estimating"" is all user inputed and while better than anything you find in quicken I believe QB Premier advertisement overstates its usefulness.I cannot emphasize enough that Intuit charges you for support with regaurds to its product which is costly to begin with. That came as a particularly nasty surprize.QB premier contractor series contributed in many positve ways to how my business runs and the job costing procedures are excellent, helpful, and informative."
2,works for awhile then clogs or breaks,"It worked okay for awhile but then the seam split (the ball is hard plastic). given that it doesn't grind much, adjustments to grind are mediocre and it's hard to load...I won't be buying another one."
2,Damaged,"The cans arrived in a plastic bag and were all bent up. I popped most of the dents out, but was not very happy that they were all bent up on arrival."
4,pro-temperance morality tale from the 19th century,"Having been raised myself in a bar next door to the author's home town of Fort Montgomery, I am fascinated to read what is called the best Temperance novel of the 19th century. Set in the 1850s, this morality tale portrays the evil of alcohol in the story of a mill owner who sells his mill to build a tavern in town. Told by a visitor to the town who stays at the tavern for ten days over a period of ten years, he shows how customers and owner are all too weak to resist the temptations of demon rum. An interesting look at pro-temperance literature of the 19th century."
2,Not up to MacGregor's usual standard,"Perhaps Kinley MacGregor / Sherrilyn Kenyon needs to concentrate on just *one* of her series, instead of churning these books out like there's no tomorrow. I say that because I purchased this book based on how much I enjoyed her earlier works - the first books in the Dark-Hunter and MacAllister series. I was so impressed then that this author wrote such wonderful fantasy AND historical romances. Those books were so packed with energy, humour and sensuality. This book was decided lacklustre. I much preferred Born In Sin."
5,A 5 star keeper,"I don't even know where to start. This is one of the best books I've ever read and when you consider I read an average of 3-5 books a week and have been doing that since I was 15, that says a lot. Kinley MacGregor has a way with heroes that blows my mind. Stryder was so solid and tough and at the same time, he had a heart for his friends and for the heroine. Rowena was smart and funny. She wasn't about to let anyone take her for granted. Their battle of wills had me laughing and the scene where she teaches Stryder to write had my heart aching. This has all the makings of a true romance classic keeper. I can't wait to read the next one in the series."
1,It's Just OK - Maybe It Deserves 2 1/2 or 3 Stars...But Why Are So Many People Handing Out 4 & 5 Stars? I Was Disappointed!,"When I see a book that has an average of 4 or 5 stars by reviewers, I expect a really good book. This book is just OK. I don't understand why so many reviewers are leaving 4 or 5 stars for a ""just OK"" book.Listen up people! If you're going to write a review, try to be a little more careful with those stars! I would have given this book 2 1/2 or 3 stars, but decided to go with 1 star to help fix the average rating of this book. I wouldn't have felt so disapointed if more reviewers were discerning and accurate with their ratings."
3,Confused and mislead,"I have read all of Kinley MacGregor's books and loved Sin's story the most. However, I'm still puzzled after reading A Dark Champion. It started out boring and eventually became confusing with too many characters and subplots. I was confused regarding the time that transpired between events and characters. I feel as though I missed important details and there were gaps in the story. Also, the book description is misleading. The main characters change drastically not very far into the book. I hope the next book is better."
1,Very Disappointing,"Any type of child abuse is intolerable, physical, sexual, verbal, mental. However, I don't think a romance book is the place to try to raise awareness of long ago abuse. When I read any book, I am trying to find a little time away from the hurtful things in life, that's why I look forward to Kinley MacGregor books, her characters and the humor I find in the books. If you are looking for either humor or strong characters about which you can care, don't purchase this book. I'm not even sure why I finished this book, I guess I was hoping it would improve."
4,Light Entertaining Read,"I agree with the 4 stars for this book. It is a light, entertaining read. Kinley MacGregor is also Sherrilyn Kenyon, therefore I expect to get a good read from her books. Although some of this is not accurate history, we are reading for fun not history.Stryder is the kind of man any woman, of any time, would want. He is strong, caring, determined, as well as tall, dark and handsome.Rowena is a strong woman, trying to make sense of the maddness in the world at that time. She wants a man of peace and understanding.These two face each other at odds. But each finds what he or she needs is not what they think.Through a fast paced plot, they come to know and realize they love each other.It is a story that could well be placed in our own time.I enjoyed the romance, and look forward to more of these stories."
1,assez pénible merci,"On dit que le ridicule ne tue pas...heureusement!!! Assez pénible a lire merci. Beaucoup de trop de personnages, des scènes absurdes des dialogues épouvantables...on passe d'une idée a l'autre sans explication ni développement. fin prévisible. LIVRE TERNE a l'extreme."
1,Predictable,"I guess we all know how these kind of books end. I haven't read a romance book in years and I remember how much I used to like them, back in my 20's . . . now, pushing 40 with a lot more reading experience, I could barely make it through this book. Too predictable even for a mindless read."
5,Another Kinley MacGregor home run!!,This is a wonderfully spectacularly sexual and suspensful book!! Great start to the Brotherhood of the Sword Series!!
5,A Dark Champion,I picked this one up and loved it. I am a huge fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon (Dark Hunter series) and decided to read her historicals. Loved this one. I had to order all of them starting with the macallisters!! All of her men are yummy and I love how you meet other characters in all her books and then they end up having a book of their own and you already know things about them!! Kinley's worlds are amazing...as a writer she is very addictive and you want to read anything that she creates!! Stryder of Blackmoor (what a name!)is very noble and you will enjoy the bond that he has with his fellow brothers..Now starting on Return of the Warrior.
2,Not competitive,"I listened to this recording of the Ligeti Etudes many times, and enjoyed it a lot, but the more I became accustomed to the unique sound, the more I felt that something was missing. For example, the first etude, which others have highly praised, was disappointing. The 13th seemed to lose intensity in the middle, almost as though the pianist started with an unsustainable tempo. So eventually I found and bought the Aimard recording (only a few dollars more) and it was a revelation--vastly more artistic and virtuosic than this one. Actually I enjoy this CD more now, as an example of how the same piece can be played so differently by different pianists. But for a first CD of this great music, the Biret is not the CD to get."
5,"Voted ""Best New Family Game"" by Games Magazine","Simple as marbles, strategic as backgammon, this game is irresistibly challenging for kids and adults. Up to 4 players set their dice atop each other's, match numbers and take a chance on rolling for a higher number. We love it!"
2,What does the title have to do with this story?,"Ten man and ten women find themselves awakening from green coffin-like containers on an apparent alien world. After the initial surprise and panic the following facts are noted: although many different languages are spoken everyone understands one another and a well stocked super market and hotel are at their disposal. After a little exploration two other groups are discovered - cavemen and medieval knights. Also discovered is a high, cold wall of fog surrounding the entire area of confinement.The plot evolves with no surprises - initial exploration by the humans, contact with the other two cultures and penetration of the ""barrier' to confront the manipulatorsThe story keeps your interest but this ground has been plowed before many times. I found Mr. Cooper's ""surprise ending"" contrived and melodramatic. Nonetheless some thoughtful sciene-fiction ideas - modestly entertaining.revised 2012-01-11"
3,A solid addition to the series!,"I really like the Bob Skinner series by Quintin Jardine. Fallen Gods is a worthy addition to the series, but there were too many plot lines to allow for the comprehensive development and depth of any one of them. In this book, it seemed like Jardine was just touching upon each of his characters because he felt he had too. Fallen Gods lacked the depth of some of his earlier books in the series. If he had concentrated on the arson, or the murder(s) instead of weaving in and out of these various plot lines, the suspense and the character development would have been better. And one does wonder why Bob Skinner stays with his wife Sarah. Whenever the going gets rough, she has an affair and he forgives her each time. He is such a strong, well-defined character and deserves an equally strong partner."
4,Good Product,"Loved this mailbox,Installed it in about 30 minutes,Make sure you bury the post deep enough,mine was too long and had to cut a section off the top so it would fit flush against the ground."
2,Wrong color,"I looked for months for a mailbox and could not find one in stores because I wanted grey. I ordered this mailbox because it was grey. It came in beige with a grey door. The box showed a grey mailbox. I hired someone to install and when I returned I had a beige mailbox, to much trouble to return."
4,nice but confusing,"I appeared in an industrial video not too long ago- the professional make-up artist used this product on me (over lip color) and I thought it looked good so I bought it. I do like the way it looks and it seems to stay on pretty well. When I say the product ""confused"" me I mean that when I bought it and dipped the applicator into the container not much product came up. This was very unlike other products I have that come up with a plentiful portion of product when used for the first time. I can't tell how much of the product is actually in the container. It is kind of pricey for what you get so I use it sparingly. Would I buy it again? Maybe. If I could find the same shade in a different product at a lower price I would probably go for that instead."
5,A terrifying true story,"The horrifying true story of the Donner Party is given its just treatment in author Limburg's fascinating book. Limburg brings the characters to life, which makes it all the more horrible when they start to die their grusome deaths. The books reads like a journalistic account and for me was a thrilling page turner, even though I already knew the outcome. This is history writing at its absolute finest."
3,battery,"Needed a new battery for my vaio and got this battery very fast. Problem was it wasn't for my model of vaio in the long run, but fit in the battery bay."
2,Too small for an adult,"The description says this bike is ""for riders under 5'10""/190 Lbs"". I'm 5'5""/165 Lbs and it is too small (and too slow) for me. Also, don't fall for the ""three speeds"": it's slow and the first two speeds are of no practical use."
2,don't waste your $$$,"other riders & parents are the BEST resource for horse show experience, NOT a book"
3,"Pretty good games, and lots of them!","Clubhouse Games is pretty good stuff. Lots of games, both for single players and for friends to compete. Includes both traditional board games such as checkers along with some interesting games like Balance, which allows you to drop blocks on a teetering plank until it goes out of balance and crashes. Mindless fun. I give it a solid ""B"""
2,Not too fun,I am very disappointed in this game. Everything is so small it is difficult to determine what you are looking at on several of the games. I would not recommend this game to anyone.
3,What is the point of having to unlock things in this game?,"I think the game is well done, but in order to play some games which i prefer, I have to waste time plodding through stupid time wasters like bowling and ""i doubt it"". I just hurried up and lost to get through them, but I don't know if I want to keep plodding through the time wasters to get to the ones I want to play. There are others ds games which I bought that are fun and don't have any locks like 'brain busters', picross, polarium, conductra, etc. They are good to go, no muss no fuss. I think this concept of the 'locked' games should be a preference that you can set on or off."
3,takes too long,"I like the games, but I hate that it takes so long to get through a round because you have to wait for the other players (computer players) to take their turn. I wish I would to be able to just play by myself or with one computer player. I also have touchmaster and that is similar (in that it has a lot of games) and I LOVE THAT and cannot put it down. I do like the variety of games in the CLUB HOUSE."
5,Love this game,A great game! Lots of fun to play this game! If you want a game that has plenty of minigames to kill some time with this has tons of little card games and I love the darts too.
5,Fun for Old Geezers!,"This game was a 20th anniversary gift for my husband, because he keeps taking MINE! I had to go out and buy him his own DSi (he's 50, after all, and needs a bigger screen), but had trouble locating the 'Clubhouse Games' game. Thanks to Amazon, he no longer has an excuse to go rummaging through my purse after MY DS (it's the 3D one! Too advanced for his gray-ness!)."
5,Great bundle of games in one title,"This game was a great game to replace the old Ultimate Brain Games for gameboy advance. It includes all the games on there and also many others. It has some fun classics such as dots and boxes, dominoes, connect five, turncoat which is reversi,and a lot more. It is well worth the money for all the games you get but is getting a bit hard to find locally now as I bought this one for my daughter for Christmas because I already had and liked it but could only find online at this time."
5,great game !!!!,"this game is really fun, me and my brother got it for an airplane flight so we had something to do, it was great, i definitley recommend this game."
2,Not what I expected,"This gives you many games to play, however you are restricted to the options within that game, for example, playing Black Jack, it wont let you play continuous, you have to reach a certain score in a certain amount of hands, if you don't reach it, you have to start again, it also wont let you double after splitting, it's very basic, like most of the games."
4,Club House Games,"This is a great game or I should say set of games. We ended up buying a 2nd game so we can play each other. The games play well, the card games play very well. I like Hearts, Sevens especially. Sevens is a quick play and a lot of fun. Chinese checkers is fun. Ludo is a fun game, but it takes longer to play. I usually like the ""quick games"" while I'm waiting for someone or something. My wife wasn't too sure about buying the DS's for the kids to begin with. But we both have taken the games over and she plays the Clubhouse Games all the time. Actually the kids 8 and 6 play Club House games also and enjoy even though this is more geared for adults. They like Balance and Dots and Boxes, bowling and darts. You can buy this if you look around for under $10. It rates up there with one of the best value purchases I've made recently. We've had a lot of use out of the games and play them almost everyday to unwind."
5,Solid Gaming,"Clubhouse games is so well rounded. The graphics are well done and the variety isoutstanding. I own many DS games and play fairly regularly, but always end up going right back to this. An excellent addition to your collection... you won't be disappointed."
3,"Solitaire okay, Mahjong bad",I mostly play the solitaire game. The Mahjong tiles are too small to see on a Nintendo DS screen.
5,Great Variety of Games,Really enjoy having all the game options. Easy to play. I'm a senior citizen who is hooked on my ds. Liked the game so much I got one for my husband!
3,OK games but visuals not so great...,"Just got this game in the mail and I was suprised when I turned it on. The graphics could be wayyyyy better than they are. They look just like a PC game or something that you can play for free on the internet. It's also got cheesy wording like ""Battle"" during black jack. What? Overall I'd say this is fun for passing the time but not as visually stimulating as I had hoped. Definately not worth $30 bucks but more like $20. If you plan on buying this try and get it when it goes on sale. Seems to be good for kids and adults who like card games and such. I'm going to keep playing it to see if it grows on me... : )"
3,and another ds game....,"This game is ok, I got it for my husband because he love to play cards and such. The format of this game is just ok. There are probably way better card games for ds. I just didn't see them when I ordered this. happy dsinn!"
3,A little disappointing...,"I bought this game because it got rave reviews on a major game review site. It's too easy (even at the hardest settings) and is missing some additional customization for the games that would make it a better experience. It's good mindless, keep myself occupied while waiting in the airport kind of fun...but nothing more challenging than that."
5,Perfect game,"I consider this game to be one of the best games for Nintendo DS. It is fun, very user friendly, with flawless online play (for 8 players !). And above all, perfect value for money.I just can't stop playing it (I prefer it to my Metroid P Hunters and Mario Kart).Recommended for ""all"" ages."
4,Club House Games review,This game is great for me. I love to play cards and usually don't have someone to do this with. The Hearts and Rummy games are good brain activity. It helps me to relax and tire out my brain before sleeping. I would buy this again. The only thing so far that I dislike is that the tiles on the Mah Jong game are small and hard to tell what each tile is. It would be better with larger symbols.
1,Not Happy,"Not happy with Checkers at all. You can only move your checkers where the computer wants you to move them, and I don't find any way to make it stop."
1,DON'T BUY,"Save your money. Don't buy this game. It has a lot of different games, but all those games that require more than one player, are really boring to play. These games go on really slowly because the program announces each different player on each turn, by showing a pop up window with the name of the player. Sometimes there are so many pop up windows on the screen you don't even know if it's your turn or someone else's. It is really bad, and I regret every penny I spent on this game."
1,Ways to Waste Your Money,Awful. The cards move so fast you can't even see them and it is very boring. I have a Palm Pilot with better card games. A total waste of my money.
2,terrible,one good song this mixtape is garbage dont waist your money i did 2star performance and thats bein generis foreal
1,Don't buy this!!,I can't say it strong enough. This product is not worth spending the time it takes to place an order. I got it along with a pole from the same company. They said that it would hold the pole that I purchased. It absolutely do not. The pole nearly fell over in virtually no breeze. A temporary fix is to tie it to the fence in several places. It looks so tacky. I'm going to take the pole down until I can mount it more securely. NOTE: I wouldn't have given it one star except that I had to in order to submit the review.
5,Worked great for 14.4 foot pole,"Just wanted to review and say that this has worked great on several camping outings in different types of terrain (rocky, rooty, clay) We use the 14.4 Flagpole to Go flagpole. I would recommend this for my friends and family. It was sturdy enough to suggest that it would work with larger poles if required."
3,Refreshingly Surprized,"I thought this story was just too cute...It was full of wonderful writing and loaded with suprizes. I thought it was a great story line that is so true to life for some 35+ singles.It was even more refreshing that the story provided love and fantasy without even one single sexual encounter. It was a really good deal for a quick pick. I had to force myself to put it down to have something to read on the return trip. I would definitely read it again (after a hot bubblebath) with a bowl of butterpecan ice cream on one of my ""do nothng weekends""."
3,pleasantly surprized at 35,"I absolutely adored this book. Picked it up at the Port Authority in NYC for a bus trip to CT. I thought it was a very humorus story with a few sprinkles of surprize in it. It was refreshing to have picked up such a cute story that served the purpose of being a quick read and a good story without the characters even having one sexual encounter. As a 35yr old single female, I thought the ""husband hunt"" was true to life and very ideal. I had to force myself to put it down, so that I would have something to read on the return trip. I will definitely read it again, this time after a nice hot shower and a bowl of butter pecan icecream; on one of my ""do nothing but relax"" weekends."
3,Is dead,"It just died after just a year of working. I used to like it was going to die so soon. Well, for $30 I can't complain."
4,Quiet yet effective,I purchased 2 for the upstairs bedrooms.The design is a bonus to the efficiency and quiet operation. I have a converted upstairs with low ceilings and these work wonderfully except not for temperatures under 20's.
2,terrible movie,"My parents bought this movie for me when I was 10 years old and I hated it. It was only half an hour long and most of the movie was just different girls saying, ""I love horses."" The only reason I give it two stars is that it does have a small amount of horse information. However, this is only the very basics of horses. It goes over the pieces of the saddle, how to groom a horse and several points on the horse. Overall it was not a good movie and I do not recomend for anyone to buy it."
3,For younger children,"I rented this video from the library for my (...) son, at the same time I rented I Love Airplanes. It didn't get much attention because he absolutely loves I Love Airplanes. But since I turned it back into the library, he has asked for it a couple of times. It has lots of footage of horses. It describes what's involved in owning a horse as a theme, but it is aimed at young children who don't have horses. It is a good toddler video. I give it 3 stars on behalf of my son. I would give it 5 stars if I were a toddler because I love horses!"
1,Waste of Time and Money,"If you really feel the need to buy this, do so. But send it to me with a pair of scissors before you read it. I will send back an abridged edition, far superior to the original. This way you can avoid the disappointment I felt....... I will even return the scissors."
2,A Tough Read,"I purchased this book keep my HST collection as complete as possible. I've owned it for 3 years and have never finished reading it. I gave it 2 stars out of generosity. Get Paul Perry's book if you can, it's a 6 star book with 5 being the best."
3,Good for a laugh.,"I have to take issue with the other reviewer who called Carroll's attempt at a bio on the un-dooable 'trite'... bollocks.Yes she tries to emulate her mentor, no it's not as good as Hunter himself. But, the blow by blow accounts arent what one would call lies, as that's what Hunter does best, politics aside. This is a fantastic little book of insights, many of the stories already exist in one form or another, and it's nice to have them in one little compendium. The real stories of his adventures far outweigh the stories told about him, anyway."
2,A mixed bag,"When Hunter's friends and colleagues are reminiscing about the great man, this book takes off. When it's left to the author to ape Hunter's style (complete with embarrassing confidences shared with YOU, dear Reader), relating plainly ficticious tales of wacky hi-jinks with the good doctor, it's tedious. All things considered, you'd be better off with 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' or 'The Great Shark Hunt'."
1,the other bad HST biography,"E. Jean Carroll apparently vacationed at Own Farm and didn't have the bang-up time she'd hoped. Deciding a good way to settle the score would be to ""write"" a ""book,"" she travelled the country talking to HST associates, friends and acquaintances. Thompson, sensibly, refused to talk to her. Finally, she invented a paper-thin fictional stand-in for herself, tried to write vaguely like Thompson, failed at that miserably, and padded the rest of the book out with bite-size chunklets from her interview transcripts. Carroll's ""writing"" is so unrelievedly horrible. The book takes about 300 pages to tell readers exactly nothing about Thompson. Until HST comes out with Proud Highway, read Peter Whitmer's HST bio instead"
3,Superb Symphony #2 but is the Cologne group impoverished?,"I still think the Telarc CD version of symphony #2 extended version is the best. This is all we really have to choose from on DVD though. This really was a motley looking group in t-shirts, jeans, unshaven and most of the time in a rehearsal hall perhaps in a college or high school. This group could have dressed up for the performance and presented it in a real concert hall. Certainly there is one in Cologne. Looks however, are deceiving. They are a superb orchestra and Semyon is an impassioned conductor though difficult to watch with his mannerisms and dressing like a slob. The picture quality and sound is excellent.....but since this was probably a shoot of a rehearsal I am not sure a DVD is necessary. I would get it just in the remote case no one else does Symphony #2. The Bells and Slavonic Dances are of interest but you will not find yourself playing them over and over again since they are mediocre pieces."
2,Wish I Had Saved My Money,"Rich Little was a fabulous imitator of voices but I guess I had never seen his shows. Looking now, they were very weak. Do not know why anyone thought he could carry a variety show. Anyone want to buy my copy?Rich Little Show: Complete Series"
5,very useful in locating wines and their vineyards,"The Wine Atlas of France by Hubrecht Duijker (with support from Hugh Johnson) is the best way to start exploring the various famous French wine regions by car. After presentation of the history and a description of a particular wine region, the book lists the address and describes the important wine estates of the region. Suggested routes for driving as well as listings of the top regional restaurants and hotels, in order to recover from the wine tasting. Besides excellent maps of different scales to find your way round the book has superb pictures so that you know what to expect. Alternatively, you may first want to use the book to browse through the various wine regions. Even without using the book as a travel guide it is very useful in locating wines and their vineyards."
5,The Best!!!,Awesome play doh activity center. My daughter got this forChristmas and my husband and I had just as much fun playing. It has plenty of storage and tons of play doh that comes with it. It also has tools and cut outs. It has a ton of stuff for the money. Super deal!!
4,Wide variety of playdoh materials,A lot of stuff for a relatively small value. Quite fun for me! A little overage for my 3 year old but I'm sure he'll pick up soon. He loves the scissors the most.
5,Homerun Toy!,I gave this to my niece for her fourth birthday and she loves it. My sister tells me that as soon as it was out of the box Katherine played with it for two hours. The area on top has plenty of space to go nuts with the play-doh and the storage underneath is huge. Another big plus......my sister tells me it takes a long time to play with so little Katherine is busy for a good chunk of time. One thing I didn't know is that it comes with play-doh...Bonus!
2,Really not that great.,"I bought this thinking it would add some fun accessories to our collection and be a good Play Doh storage box too. Well, it does have some fun items but is uneccessarily large for storing them. And if it was meant for storage, it completely missed the mark. The walls between the side partitions only go up half way, so forget trying to organize accessories into separate compartments - they overflow into each other. Then, these same half walls prevent storing any of the larger Play Doh items like the ice cream shop, the pasta maker, Cookie Monster, etc. Finally, I have no idea why the box is shaped like a lap pad - it's too awkward for a child to sit with legs under and play. Plus this strange design wastes a ton of area that could be valuable storage. It is a nice sturdy plastic though - I'll give it that."
4,"Lots of fun, price compare first","This toy was given to my 3 yr old son for Christmas and he loves it. It's huge, but it stores all the tools and any others you have managed to collect. It comes with so many different items, we have fun playing with it everyday. There is also room inside for me to store a sheet to put down so the dough doesn't stick to the carpet. My only warning: price compare first. The price on Amazon fluctuates, so when my sister bought this it was $20 cheaper at a big name toy store. Also, the review that notes the ""picker upper"" doesn't work well and the roller has to have all the cutters on it, that's true, but it doesn't take away from the overall fun of the toy for me or my son. A great gift idea too."
5,Compact Fun,"This was a big hit this Christmas for my two little grandbabies. Both girls, one 3 the other 4. Usually I avoid toys that are plastic with oodles of little parts, but this was a winner. The plastic cleans up easily, the parts all have a place be stored. I use to tread pulling out the play doh. But this center is compact and easy to set up, clean up and put away. The girls like to play with it on the floor and it's big enough for both to play with at the same time. We all love it."
4,Great Toy,This is a wonderful value! My four-year old son AND nine-year old daughter really get their creative juices flowing when they sit and create using this center.
5,Very Nice Product,"Besides being able to play the games, I gave a bag to my daughters first grade class. They are passed out to the students who use then when they are learing to add and subtract."
4,i feel like more music was on this soundtrack,"it's a great selection, but i feel like a lot is missing. ""bad, bad leroy brown"" isn't on there, for example."
3,Fiddle Dee Silly,"Fiddle Dee Death is pretty fiddle dee silly, but hey, the world needs more silly. This cozy mystery is every bit as charming as Miss Scarlett, but if you're sitting there asking, ""Scarlett who?"" you'd better skip this one. It would be way too Southern for you. It's a quick fun read, but strictly girl stuff."
3,Perhaps Mam should be telling this story,"If Lindsey Fox is the main character in Fiddle Dee Death, she deserves to have a larger part in the book. Her cousins, Mam and Bonnie, get most of the good lines, leaving poor Lindsey looking as dull as dishwater. This leaves the reader wondering why Lindsey was chosen to tell the story. Her relationship with Will is bereft of any emotional depth and seems tacked on in order to fill space. The murder victim gets my sympathy because none of the characters seem to care that he's dead...other than the three(Nancy Drew wannabe)cousins desiring credit for solving the mystery."
1,Not my cup of tea...,"It took me three attempts to read the 1 page verbose, descriptive prologue.Actually, I never got through it and just skipped to Chapter 1. Praise be, I saw dialogue! My elation was short-lived because the conversation turned out to be absolutely inane. ""Dad-gum, he's dead. ... He's cold."" ""Yes, but Ms. ---- doesn't have the heat on."" It was supposed to be funny, I'm sure, but fell flat as a pancake and it didn't get better.The Southern cliches and stereotypes were way over done, and I'm from the South! I didn't/couldn't read past Chapter 3.With back cover recommendations from Fannie Flagg and Carolyn Hart, I expected much more. Then I noticed on the last page that one author was a reviewer for the Orlando Sentinel. Hmm, that explained a lot--how so many high level authors ""blurbed"" this book.Every book isn't for every person, but as an Evanovich and Anne George fan, this book was definitely not for me."
2,Huh?,"Let me begin by saying I am as southern as they come and enjoyed many things about the book as I could totally relate. BUT....as others have said, there are too many characters, can't keep up with anyone and nothing flows. The only thing I am sure about is that somebody died. That's about it. I finally gave up on the book when they got locked in the attic only to be rescued by an elderly aunt (I think she was an aunt...with so many characters...I could be wrong). It was just so dumb. Why is an elderly 'person/aunt' in the attic? This could have been a great book. It just wasn't."
1,Ever go to a movie and left shaking your head?,"Did you ever go to a movie that was acclaimed by critics only to mumble to yourself, ""Why on earth did I pay to see that?"". You shake your head and wonder where do critics come up with these acclaims.That is precisely how I felt reading this murder mystery novel. It was hard enough to figure out the characters, I still don't really know who 'I said' is! There were so many characters in and out of the story I got dizzy. Needless to say the characters are less than one dimensional. The writing is a novelists nightmare. There are no emotions involved. All you get are Cissy said, Margaret Ann 'said', I said, he said, blah, blah, blah, for about fifty characters. If I see one more said, I'll scream.I couldn't really find a plot other than a murder and I'm not certain who was murdered. I should read it again, but NO THANK YOU!HOW DO REVIEWS AND CRITICS COME UP WITH THEIR REVIEWS? DO THEY READ THE BOOKS?"
5,One of the masterpieces of the Nineteen century,Truly a great book. I don't have much to say but that it keeps you captivated and enchanted while you are reading it. (the first 3 chapters are a bit boring but from then on it storms). Julien is a truly loveable character to me. Charming in his oprtuinism and unflinching attitude towards life. He preys on life. Also a very educative book - i've learned and got interested so much on the subjects of france of the french revolution and the restoration. A must to read. mind and spirit agitating.
2,Opera without the Music,"I was told that you have to read this book twice to really enjoy it, well I question that premise. Why would you want or have the time to read a book twice just to enjoy it, when there is so many wonderful books out there to read? Anyway to me this book was like a bad opera without the music. Things keep happening that just don't make sense to move a fantastical plot along. The Dad the brothers the women he loves are just so unbelievable that I could only think opera."
3,EEEEhhhhhh....It was okay,"Tempting the Highlander started out strong, but fizzled in the end. It had a strong plot line, loads of mysteries and smart-alic foster kids to boot....all in all it all adds up to the kinda story I enjoy reading....but unfortunatley I found myself waiting for the story to end...I felt the author crammed way to much into her story and though the two main characters were interesting, I found it way to hard to keep up with their issues and remember who is whose uncle and who was whose mom...and I must say I am still confused... This is definetly one of those books that you will have to read and re-read...and even take an occasional note...to understand what the heck the author was trying to convey...If you are interested in reading this book I would suggest that you borrow it from a library or a friend...don't waste your money buying it..."
2,Stretch of the Highlands,"How is this book considered a ""highlander"" romance? Story is weak, character development is so-so, no ""hot"" scenes. Sheesh! If all people could get over years of abuse as well as the heroine, we'd be living in a great world."
5,I loved this book!!!,"I read each and every book from this series in order and nonstop. OMG...What an amazing experience Granted there were some characters that I loved thoughout the series. One of the things that most impressed me is we really get to see the happily ever after throughout the series.If you have the money and can afford to buy the whole set, that is the experience that you are shooting for from this author. Chapman is creative funny, and sincere with these characters and you feel the love between main players as well as the family they have around them. After all those books I was still left wanting more.I passed my set to my sister. She calls me at the end of each one to discuss the new characters, the new dynamic they'll create in future novels in the series.Truly a fun read. The best read since my first historical romance (Knight in Shining Armor)."
2,This One's Flat Compared to the Other Books,"I couldn't wait to get this book; I thought I'd love it, but in truth, it wasn't very interesting at all. It was tedious. I only finished it in deference to Robbie MacBain because I'd read about him and his family already. Those books were great, but this one just didn't hold up as a romance, to be sure. It was about Robbie's obligation to his ""clan"" and his life with his 4 foster sons."
2,No Romance To Speak Of....,"Robbie, who was a great guy, by the way, and Catherine, who was pretty but uninspiring, didn't even hug til page 190, and the book wasn't that long! I didn't feel much of a connection between Robbie and Cat, but it might not have been their fault. The blame lies with the story-line, which could have been a LOT better. To have so many characters as this book did, including Cat's 2 kids, Robbie's 4 foster sons, and Robbie's rather large family, AND the ever-present priest, Daar, you'd think something would have clicked to make this book interesting, but unfortunately it fell short. The other Higlander books were great."
2,Blah,"Catherine lacked personality and I could never get a handle on who she really was. She failed to brighten up this book, which desperately needed brightening. I mean, Robbie was adorable and charming and handsome and all, but the STORY was just plain boring and he nor Cat were lively enough to make up for this."
4,Good Story,This book was pretty good. I am getting a little tired of the series. This story had more freshness with the characters than previous books. It was nice to see a strong female character. I enjoyed the book.
5,One of the best in the series,"This is the fourth novel in the highlander series by Janet Chapman, and the first where the hero is not one of the highlanders that traveled forward in time. This is the story of Robbie MacBain who needs to travel back in time to ensure his relatives, (who traveled forward in time during a freak storm caused by an interfering wizard)can stay in this time with their wives and families. If you haven't read the other novels first, you might be a little confused, but this novel stands pretty much alone. You can read this one without reading the others. I love how Robbie is a laid back guy who loves kids and fosters troubled teen boys. He is a true hero. The heroine is a feisty loving mother who is trying to escape her husband who has gotten out of jail after abusing her. The children are frightened of men...until Robbie. A heart warming story."
2,Just Too Boring...,"Good grief, this wasn't much of a love story and there wasn't much of a relationship between Robbie and Catherine. I had to read more than half the book before they FINALLY had a romantic moment alone and they hugged. This book dealt mainly with Robbie and his priest and Robbie's responsibilties to his family, and Robbie's relationship with his four teenage foster sons."
1,mailbox,First of all this is not a toy... It is a mailbox... It is fine.. the only complaint I would have is that it appears to be a lighter almost white color and in reality it is a dark tan.. that was a disappointment.. The color should be listed in the description...
5,Great mail box,"We love this mail box! My house is on a busy street so the rear access is an essential safety feature for my preschoolers. My kids refer the mail box as ""the little house"". It is a little wobbly since we didn't use cement to anchor it. It is well made and withstand the northeastern winter storms well. The numbers on the side are a little small but we are OK with it."
4,Glasses Not Guaranteed,"Just wanted to alert potential buyers to the fact that the glasses are not covered under the traditional Corelle guarantee.Bought a set for my daughter, within one week two of the glasses had broken from falling over in the sink! Not sure if they are especially fragile; but suggest you consider buying a set of Corelle with mugs or cups and saucers as in my experience they were covered under the guarantee of workmanship."
5,cheerful pattern,"We purchased this set for our new sailboat as they are low profile-they take up little space. I was surprised the glasses were glass, for I had imagined them plastic. The dishes pattern is ""sunny"" and is a little cheerful, but they are growing on me. So far,so good."
1,broom broke within 1 hr,"The broom broke within 1 hr was made very cheap that is why we orderd a second broom, costume was ok quality"
3,terrible audio production,"There are some great afro cuban melodies and rifts, but the recording was made too close the percussion instruments. The vocals are drowned out and the true composition is barely audible. It is not bad but for the price, it is more a collectors' item."
3,great for in the bathtub!!!,"All the peices do well in the tub, The realistic nature of the peices is really nice. I would give it a ten on it's realistic nature and the fun peices that come with this set, but unfortunatly this set will not hold up to any kind of rough play or being accidently sat on, Several of the animals have had peices break off and we have only had it a month. I would not recommend this for a family that is worried about chocking dangers with young children, because at random times a leg or lawer jaw or how nows what will just snap off. Although the kids are playing with it like most kids will, they are not slamming or pounding on the peices to justify the breaking of the peices.so caution watch out for chocking hazards!!!!!!!!!Otherwise lots of fun. And worth the money if you have a child that loves shark and adventure playsets."
4,Awesome,This is a great product to have - not to mention cheaper than a jewelry box. It really does keep everything organized. I am planning on buying this as gifts for my friends. The only downside is that this one doesn't have zipper so you can't travel with it.
4,Good starter set,"My son loves golf, so I got him this set of clubs for Christmas. He's 4 so these clubs will probably last him till he's 7. The driver is almost as tall as he is(He's 42"" tall). The build quality seems pretty good, good enough for a 4 year old golfer I'd say."
4,Good Beginner Set,We got this set for my 2 boys (6 and 8). They have used them at the driving range a few times and like them. The bag looks sturdy enough and easy to carry even for the 6 year old. It looks like a good inexpensive way to get kids started on the game.
2,Disappointing quality,"I bought a set of these clubs for each of my sons last year. A couple of weeks later, the kids were using their clubs at the driving range, and the head of one of the irons came off the club in the middle of a backswing! Fortunately, it didn't hit anyone. Then a few months later, the head came off one of the putters while my son was practicing. We have glued the heads back on, and the boys are still using the clubs, but we are disappointed with the quality of these clubs. Also, the wood is too long, even for my 7 year old son. The reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because I like the bag - at least that part of the set has worked out."
2,may,"Please tell me How much ""make-up artists handbook for stage screen and vedio""? I live in Taiwan,R.O.C. may email:ziab1791@ms63.url.com.tw"
2,Unimpressive Heater,"The HCH5822-U space heating unit we purchased looked and operated poorly. The digital thermostat was wildly inacurate per an indepentant thermometer in the same room, often not turning off the unit until the room temp was 8-10 degrees warmer than intended. The buttons were ""sticky"" and not always responsive.There are far superior alternatives to this heater in this price range."
5,Great Guidance Tool,"I have just started reading this book and found it to be informative, enlightening and a great tool for any believer."
2,Couldn't get it to work with my phone,I couldn't get this to work with my phone. Not sure if it is the product or if it is the phone. Hope to get different phone in future. Will try it again with new phone.
5,No comparison,"This is truly a joy to use. I am on conference calls about 4 hours a day. The headset is very comfortable, and the battery life allows me to be on the phone as long as I want. I've had other Plantronics CS-line sets before, and the sound quality is equal to a hard-wired telephone. The set is a bit pricey. Even so I am thinking of buying another to use with my computer for Skype (the CS50-USB). I only wish this set had a dual interface (landline and USB) and was slightly less money."
2,HL10 device does not work with all phones and it is hard to find out which phones are compatible,"I like this device and had one before. However, it is really difficult to determine which phone is compatible with the HL10 lifter device.The Plantronics people are somewhat. They do not provide a list of compatible phones unless you ask a manager, so it is very hard to go shopping for a phone once you have the HL10 lifter.They do not respond to questions at their web site very quickly.The website is not so functional either. It is slow and the tool to select the equipment is not so good."
3,A combination of both UK singles in 1,"TBH unless you collect japanese singles, it is probably cheaper to get the 2 UK singles, however they both come in those god awful cardboard slipcases with the plastic tray that never stay ooking nice.Check out my other 2 reviews on the UK versions for song reviews but overall the Todd Terry remixes are pretty awful, however the 2 vocal remixes are very good."
4,The Perfect Weapon,"This video inspired me to begin study of Master Ed Parker's Kenpo Karate; I am now a Green belt, beginning study towards my 3rd degree Brown belt. I have had the opportunity to meet and train with Mr. Jeff Speakman on a couple of occasions; the speed and abilities that he displays in the movie are not enhanced by special effects. The film also gives insight into the true purpose of the martial arts---it is not an art for vengeance, as Jeff's character realizes, but an art to defend those who may not be able to defend themselves."
5,The Perfect Martial Arts Movie,"Jeff Speakman, tons of fight scenes, a couple of old school villains, and Escrima sticks. The Perfect Weapon is the ""Perfect"" martial arts movie!"
5,Great,Have this movie on VHS. Wore it out. When I saw I could get the DVD Ijumped at the oppertunity. Great movie
4,You are kidding me?,"This is one of the best and most fun martial arts movies I've ever seen. I have it on laserdisc and have seen it no where else... Sure, some acting screw ups (baseball hats on, then off, then on again) and some cheesey dialog. But not really... I feel physically hurt in some scenes. Even if you don't buy, watch this! very under-rated.I cannot believe a random check on it shows me that it's skipping all the way to BluRay. nice... ty"
4,He is the perfect weapon,I've seen this movie several times and it never ceases to amaze me. I myself practice traditional chinese kenpo but american kenpo came from that. It was a great flick and i enjoyed seeing things that i know put in a movie. It was definitely worth 4 stars.
4,kenpo rocks!!,"I've seen this movie once and it stuck in my head for a long time , that's why i am going to buy this film on video. The action fighting scenes are great and the very fast jeff speakman is great and by gods power he can kick some @ss you know what i mean.And i get tired of that jackie chan's corn ball fighting style it's boring to see jackie chan fighting he's more of a clown in his movies today.We need good martial arts heroes' like cindy rothrock i think that's her name,she good too as well as jeff he have's a great kenpo style that's fast and cool i wish he make more films today because martial arts films like the MATRIX has a lot of butt kicking action an jeff speakman needs to be apart of this action genre,so that's why i am buying this movie PERFECT WEAPON"
1,Because it's only available on used VHS,"I'm 100% with all of you who say it should be released on DVD!!! I am rating this only one star not because it is a bad movie - the movie is excellent. It's because this item is VHS and it's a dead format. I haven't had a VHS player for years and have no intention of getting another one...I saw this movie several years ago and have wanted to get it on DVD for years; which is why I found myself on this page. I want it and can't understand what reasoning the studio might have for releasing material that their customers want. Actually, the word idiot comes to mind!I notice that someone is selling their VHS copy for $129. That's just insane! I wonder if someone will actually pay that for it."
2,audio not right,"PICTURE QUIALTY GREAT AUDIO SLIGHTY OFF VERY FRUSTRATING.ANYONE ELSE HAVE THIS PROBLEM NOT MY BLURAY PLAYER OTHER DVDS FINE.THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE ,TO BAD IT WAS COPIED WRONG."
4,Review By A Kenpoist,"Wow. This movie is incredible. Unlike most martial arts movies, this one has real combat and techniques taken from Ed Parker's American Kenpo system. The plot is also pretty good, which is getting rarer and rarer. Having studied EPAK for a few years, I was really glad to see this movie because, as I said, it is real. Speakman's opening form is pretty good too, but part of me wishes that instead it showed him doing either Long Form 4 or 7. Regardless, if you have a VHS player then buy this movie. It will not be a waste of money."
5,Finally is right!!,Just received my Blueray copy and am so exited. This is a majorly underrated martial arts film. Speakman is pretty much a bada$$ and I wish that he did more films like this. Happy Watching!
4,Great Movie,This movie was a favorite of mine in High School. Like a lot of Martial art movies it has a bad plot and a cheese e dialog but the action more then makes up for it. It also has a lot of good one liners. I wish they would put this on DVD.
4,"Decent, but Not a Cure all.","This has perennial rye, creeping red fescue, and Kentucky bluegrass. The bag says it is adapted for sites with ""2 -10 hours a day"" of sun. Maybe... Perennial rye will not survive with only 2 hours of sun. Kentucky bluegrass loves the sun, and fescue does well in shade. The idea is that you can spread this everywhere, and see what sticks to the wall. But that also means that some of the seed is going to be wasted. The water coating can help if you forget to water, but it means you get 50% non-seed in your 3lb package, and some of that will go into areas where it is unlikely to do well. So this is merely decent seed, at a high price."
1,this is a dance movie?,"I love dance movies, and this isn't one. There was two main dance sequences and neither was good. There are hundreds of serious, talented, and out of work dancers that would have been better in this roll. The story line needed work as well, I can forgive a story line if the dancing is out of this world but this movie was below par on everything."
3,"Fits, but it isn't the same pad as came with the 206",I found this pad to fit okay in the top tray of my Fluval 206 filter. But it is certainly not the same pad that came originally with the filter.The box did list the 206 on it even though the product description doesn't list the 206.It does seem to work fine and do the job. I would just like to have one like originally came in the filter. I think that pad was MUCH better.
4,"Does polish the water, doesn't fit great.","I don't know if the interior of the 206 pump is slightly differently shaped or if this pad just fits slightly loose to begin with. It does work, but takes quite a while - enough water gets past the filter that small particles avoid the filter for hours, or days. Some of it may be due to a newer tank (old bio load though, so no bacterial bloom) and very fine sand still coming up into the water - but it is hard to come up with a reason that a product manufactured by the same company that made the pump fits with a full 1/4"" gap around the edges. ???Again, it works well - and I will probably keep one in continually because it does make a difference - but I don't get the undersized aspect. Perhaps it is to allow flow even if the media gets seriously clogged - but if you are going to be that inattentive, why buy a polishing pad?"
1,Don't waste your money - Buy a bag of floss and do it yourself,"This is a waste of money, all you get is 3 pieces of filter floss cut up in the shape of the filter canister, you can do this yourself much cheaper."
5,Best Gluten Free snack on the market!,"If you suffer from Celiac, you know that yummy treats are expensive. There are many flavors that Mrs. May offers, and because they are essentially all nuts, it does not take much to have a satisfying snack or treat after a meal, at a great price. Also, I am very sugar-sensitive and these fit in well with not disrupting my levels."
3,"Mrs May's snacks, coconut almond","These nuts were really hard to chew. The coconut coating seems to have made the difference, because the regular Almond crunch is quite different. My kids cannot bite into this particular snack, and they love almonds, and all the other snacks from Mrs Mays that we have tried. Also the coconut taste is very subtle, and you only get it as an after-taste."
2,Delicious but at a price,I loved Mrs. May's Cashew Crunch. What I didn't love about it was the nutritional information. The pieces it is cut into are very small. They are easily popped into the mouth and in a crunch or two they are gone. So consuming the entire pouch is VERY easy to do! ONE OUNCE of this has 172 calories! 12 grams total fat (2 grams Saturated Fat)! Once ounce is gone so quickly that you'll easily overdo it. This snack may be made with healthier ingredients than the garbage you can buy at the local store but it is in no way healthy to eat this snack. I love it but I'll never eat it again.
1,"Not a ""health food"" if it's made in China","This product is made in China. I would not believe any claims they make regarding allergy safety and vegan/kosher. Considering Mrs. May's markets itself as a healthy product, I was shocked when I glanced at the back and noticed this product was made in China. China has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices. Unsafe toys, dog food, and now we're supposed to trust them making our health food?Not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world. I will not buy this product anymore.I would rather purchase the Sahale snacks that are made in the US, even if they are a bit more expensive."
1,It's made in CHINA!!!,"I feel bad when I notice this product is made in China...If you like product of China (especially Food), it maybe a good choice to you.But I totally regret to but it!"
5,Excellent product,"The product was fresh,healthy and delicious.Highly recommended as a replacement for unhealthy snacks."
4,addicting,"Very addicting, is a solid form of the chinese sesame pudding dessert. I would buy this again."
3,"Excellent, but some parts are not for me","CD also just goes under the name ""Concerts."" I like Keith Jarrett's music, but this cd is a bit too jazzy in parts....but a some parts are beyond excellent."
3,Red Lives,"The author, wife of the more famous journalist Edgar Snow, managed to sneak into Communist Shansi for a few months in 1937 to conduct interviews and compile first-person biographies of Red Chinese leaders. Since the leaders, from Mao on down, saw the Revolution as the only important thing going on, each life story quickly turned into the History of the Communist Party in China. Trying to get these dedicated revolutionaries to reveal anything personal was like pulling teeth. The so-called autobiographies become tedious after a while, but fortunately the author doesn't focus entirely on the leaders. There is an entire section on Communist Youth and another on Communist Women. The latter included the thirty women who had taken the complete Long March, and were headed by K'ang K'e-ching, wife of Chu Teh, and Ho Tzu-ch'ün, second wife of Mao Tse-tung (soon to be replaced by Jiang Qing of the infamous Gang of Four)."
4,A delightful book loosely based on history,"The story flows easily, with references to places familiar to most Louisianians. Loosely based on my grandfather's life, but with enough adventures added to make the story fun. An easy read."
5,Spanish Superstar,"Peruvian born but based in Mexico you will be thrilled to hear this young woman's magnificent voice. Singing everything from Opera's most lovely arias to soul churning Boleros this person deserves some promotion here in North America. The material, the musicians, the arrangements, and that voice! Grab all her stuff where ever you can find it."
4,Fun for all ages,"If you love arts and crafts you'll love this book. It explores in a practical way infinite pattern possibilities to be applied in all kind of works: mosaics, paper art, painting, book covers, ceramics, silk painting, etc.Because it comes with 24 rubber stamps you can create your own prototipes or just copy those shown on the booklet that comes with the kit.Also a different kind of gift to surprise."
5,A Must Read,"Ms. Martin's collection of reminiscences is a must read for aficionados of Southwestern Hispanic Culture. A perfect companion to her previous collection, ""Songs My Mother Sang to Me""."
3,Give it a chance,"I have to say that when I first started to read this book it didnt flow well to me, it also seemed that the author was a tad snobbish BUT I kept reading. I found that she wasnt snobbish but did have a true interest and passion for the things she was writing about. While I dont share her interests she did inspire me to look inside myself to figure out what my real interests and passions are. She also inspired me to view my town as a vacation spot and to seek out things to do, granted I live in Ft Drum and not Virginia Beach this place does have some things to do that I havent done yet. I had started to review this book when I first began reading it which is why it has 3 and not 4 stars, I cant figure out how to go back and change the rating."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I have to say I wasn't expecting much from this book, and I was pleasantly surprised. The book is a repackaging of a bunch of chapters from other C# books that have been 'adapted' to work as one complete work. The topics range from syntax basics, to UI, database and web work. The tone of the book is uneven, but each of the chapters is written well and presents it's topic clearly. The paper and binding is pretty cheap, but given the price that is to be expected.For the money this is a good buy. If what you want are some code fragments and explanation on all of the basic .NET and C# topics, you should consider this book. I just went to the index to find examples for XML, and found some quality ones right away. When you consider how much you would have to spend in other publisher's catalogues to get the same material, you can see with this is a bargain."
3,Hard Vice,"For Matchbox Twenty, they've gone about so many changes within the time their last record Mad Season was issued. It was really time to bring in something exciting and brand new to the moment. Still, with a younger crowd that would much rather hear the violent tones of 50 Cent and Enimem, they've came back into a stronger vibe and a harder sound. The first single from More Than You Think You Are, Disease, is a hard core Rock song that brings a mew meaning to music. Still, the hard core vibe isn't anything new to the music industry, but to Matchbox Twenty it was a turn for the stronger. Still, I didn't like this song as much as their latest single, Unwell. Hopefully, another hit will come around."
3,Interesting Speculation on Freemasonry,"British occultist and Mason, Albert Churchward, seeks to explain in this book first published in 1920 the relationship of the Masonic Lodge to the religions of humanity and the species' larger evolution from the ""dawn of time."" Churchward was never an admired thinker or writer, but he clearly had a knack for expressing provocative ideas on the origins of Freemasonry, the evolution of humanity, the symbology of ancient Egypt, and a host of other esoterica. All of these concerns are expressed in this stimulating and infuriating work. His history is labored and not a little off-base, his theories are frequently speculative, and his explanations of political positions are often laughable. Nonetheless, this is an interesting and provocative statement of what certain segments of society believed about Freemasonry in the first part of the twentieth century."
4,Beautiful Film!,"Set on the shores of Lake Michigan, the title refers to a weather phenomena that piles up snow locally and across eastward. The movie begins with Ross Partridge character struggling both financially and in his personal life when his very pregnant somewhat-estranged daughter shows up while he's on holiday with his girlfriend in a stunning, secluded lake-front rental. And then the teen father-to-be shows up: four is definitely a crowd. The characters don't really have much in common but they do try; the movie goes from a farce to a rom-com with some really funny moments in between.SPOILER ALERT: The film ends predictably with the teenage girl giving birth in hospital with complications and a whole existential ICU scene where you dont know if the baby will make it but everyone learns a alot about themselves in the process. (Just kidding! i just made that up... im not going to spoil it.)"
1,Josh Groban Concert,Very disappointed in the product I love the artist but was not impressed with the DVD It needed to be stated that it was not in English
5,Excellent CD/DVD,"Though the CD is short, it contains the impossible-to-find ""O Holy Night."" Seriously, this song is a CD-exclusive, on this disc only. The DVD is fantastic, as well. Josh has some great guests appear in the concert. I definitely recommend it for any fan, casual or die-hard, of Josh Groban."
5,Amazing.... As Always,"Another work of art by Mr. Groban. His music will leave you inspired, breathless and may even bring you to tears.As part of the Grobanite army... This is a must have!"
5,excellent,"Josh was absolute perfection during this concert. I didn't care for the guest performers much. While it is undeniable that they are all very talented, they simply cannot shine in Josh's shadow. He's too good. Of the two live DVDs he's released, this is by far the better selection. Both are worth having, if you are a die-hard Groban fan, but if you had to choose, this is the best one. His voice is clear and beautiful. Enjoy it!"
4,Fabulous!,"After reading negative reviews on Josh's Live At The Greek CD/DVD set, I wondered nervously if the Josh Groban in Concert (with Bonus DVD) set heading my way in the mail would be disappointing as well. However, that is not the case.Josh delivers with amazing talent & charm, & wears tasteful clothing. :-)My only complaints about the DVD are:1. Not enough behind the scenes, &2. What the heck was Lili Haydn wearing!?Anyways, as for the CD, it has only two new songs; the rest are more of those on his first album, but the set is worth buying merely for the DVD, as it's rendition of Canto Alla Vita is stunning, & gave me the chills.Definitely a must-have for major Grobanauts."
1,Not the Best,"Not the best example of his vocal and style range. he probably agrees, as reflectedx by it's sales. Not up to his usual EXCELLENCE. He'll do better next time I am sure"
5,God given talent,"I purchased this CD with DVD and the CD is perfect-pure, sweet and undeniably a voice given by I believe is a God given talent. I watched a little bit of Michael Buble ( who also has a natural voice) vs. Josh Groban and had to laugh to myself because he performed Buble's songs better, much better and better still. Unfortunately the DVD was split in half and could not be watched, so I had reorder it again, this time I hope the DVD is intact. If I could marry that voice and listen to his voice anytime I would consider it a privilege. I have every CD he has ever made and put my earphones in and go to sleep listening to his amazing voice. My beloved husband of 32 years also loves Josh Groban's performances and every song he has made. It really doesn't matter what language the song is in, his voice and the orchestrations make you feel every song. Perfect..............."
5,Josh Groban in Concert,"What can one say about this young man, a superb voice indeed, stirs every emotion within the listener, a true "" heart"" musician. Josh is also a pretty good pianist & keyboard player, I did not know that. The other artists performing in this concert were wonderful in their own right, I wish them every success."
5,More than worth the price,"I have found this music to be a source of delight, solace, and pure enjoyment. I would strongly reccomend it to anyone who appreciates beautiful music and the artistry of Josh Groban's unique voice."
2,Just OK,"I was disappointed in this CD, not too many songs in English, and not very good ones. Haven't viewed the DVD yet, so I'm hoping that there are better songs on it. Not a good buy if you're looking for another Josh Groban CD to listen to in the car."
5,Josh Groban in Concert,"Sirs:This was one of three Josh Groban titles I purchased all at once, and so far this is on of the great titles he has put out. I think, as do other professional Tenors, that Josh is headed to the top real fast. He's great."
4,Bringing Classics to the Masses,"Although I wouldn't quite call Josh Groban a threat to Andrea Bocelli and his genre, he has a style and appeal that opens the classics and bel canto singing to the masses. Hey, anyone who can do that and still put a good measure of quality in his work deserves at least four stars!"
5,A voice that touches your soul,"I first heard of Josh on the duet with Charlotte Church, ""The Prayer"". His voice touched the heart of me that has been longing to hear the perfect pitch of excellence! Not since the new voice of Streisand in the 60's have I been so moved! Josh not only sings a broad array of music, from classical to love tunes, but he is believeable! He really FEELS the music, and a listener can't help but be pulled into the rapture of words and melody! I saw the special on PBS and I couldn't wait to own it for myself! Ah, yes, I have become a ""Grobanite"", and PROUD OF IT!"
5,What a voice!!!,I am so glad that Josh has finally put out another CD and a DVD as a bonus. A must have for any Josh Groban fan. My only regret is that the CD does not have all the tracks that is on the DVD. The quality of the DVD is super! A great young voice!!!!
5,Absolutely Fabulous!!!,"After having just received my DVD/CD combo today,I could hardly wait to tear the plastic off of it.With high anticiption for the release of this PBS special it certainly was worth the wait.The quality of the program is so much more in the DVD version than what I had previously viewed on PBS.What a treat!!!The release of ""O Holy Night"" brings chills down my spine.Previous recordings now available for example ""For Always""and ""Broken Vow"" surely will become #1 hits.The music is intense,the lyrics melt the soul as Josh gives an outstanding performance.Also to note the excellent footage of behind the scenes rehersal and backstage happenings in putting this production was extremely enjoyable.Go and get several copies! They are gold!!!A Grobanite Forever"
3,Too many Italian language songs.,"I love Josh's voice, but wish it would have been more of an English speaking cd. There is nobody that can sing ""O Holy Night like he does."
5,A brilliant Masterpiece,This DVD is absoutely wonderful! He has such a remarkable voice! The CD is great but it is even better to see him sing the songs! He sings as though he is right in your own home! Josh has so much emphasis and passion in his music! He is truely a gifted vocalist! I would most certainly recomend this DVD to anyone who would love to have great music on a DVD in their home!
2,Same Songs,Really love his voice and would buy more if he would just learn some different songs. I got 85% of these on his first album
1,Mostly Repeats,"I purchased the new ""concert"" album and found almost all the songs were the same as the original album. I feel like I got ""ripped off"" and warn others to review the song titles before buying this ""duplicate""."
2,Is That All There is?,Nice voice with lots of potential if anyone had the guts to corral him and get him to realize he really hasn't yet arrived...after two songs anyone with an ear realizes that everything sounds the same..lush orchestration and clever miking....will this artist be satisfied with the plastic media adulation he has now or hope for something better? Time will tell...
2,Lackluster,"I think I knew about Josh Groban long before most people did, and I know I introduced him (via my website) to hundreds.This CD/DVD combination was a major disappointment for me. So much so, that I gave it to a relative instead of keeping it.All I can say is, Josh, diversify. All your songs are sounding the same to me, and it's getting boring.Gorgeous vocals go only so far when the songs, great as they are, seem uninspired. I found the television special (DVD) to be like this: You see and hear one song, and you've seen and heard them all. ""The Prayer"" was, in my humble opinion, irritating, as bad as when a singer tries to inject soul into the ""Star Spangled Banner.""It just doesn't work."
1,talent gone wrong,"what a shame! - a young man with talent immediately thrown into the publicity mill and encouraged to wreck his voice - he needs to learn how to sing better, not waste his talents on this truly awful music - Afanasieff? who is this person..... this album is truly unlistenable - and breaks my heart...."
4,Brief ...but with beautiful flourishes,"""Warm Miami May"" and ""See Through Plastic"" are well worth owning, and for any Air Miami/Unrest fan(not to mention early Velocity Girl), these tracks will suffice until they put out something new. When exactly that will be nobody knows."
3,Oliver Reed Rules!,"This is an Oliver Reed tour de force. He mugs, dances, puts on accents and never stops entertaining. Well, for the first hour at least. After that the picture suddenly falls apart. NOTE: The Searchers provide the title song (""The System"") and that's all. Contrary to what you read above, they do NOT make a club appearance in the film. The Marauders and the Sabres do, but no sign of the Searchers. Not a great film by any means but fun, especially for Reed freaks."
4,Wonderful single hits. But it misses a major one,"Everyone have heard the sweet songs like Rain And Tears, I Want To Live, Spring Summer Winter And Fall. This CD gethers a few pieces of wonder. And those who are familiar with the Band, will miss the sweet Marie Jolie, witch bring us back nice moments from early teenage. In most of the pieces you can recognise in the backgroud, the firsts chords of what I would call the Vangelis Music, a singular atmosphere. And also the greek folk music in the voice os Demmis Roussos. Buy it, you will really love it."
2,Fake Looking for the price.,I bought this border to create a flower bed and I have to agree that the slate gray is very fake looking. I ended up spray painting it white and it doesn't look as bad. Definitely not something I would have bought had I seen it in the store.
2,What is this?,When I got this book I returned it right away. What is with the overly large print? I'm not blind and I'm not 4 years old. I thought it was a children's book. I didn't buy it from Amazon and the other internet company did not let me know that this was large print. Was the publishing company trying its best to fill up enough pages so that they could release this as a book? I want more bang for my buck.
2,"So good, but it broke my tooth","I love these bars, but today while eating one I broke my tooth. After reading the other reviews I wonder if Mrs. Mays shouldn't trust China with making their product. What I bit down on was much harder than any of the ingredients in there should have been."
1,MADE IN CHINA!,I was VERY excited to find this snack and opened it right away. They tasted amazing & I couldn't believe the great price for the product! THEN I found out they are MADE IN CHINA! You've got to be kidding me! I seriously have a problem with that & will be returning the products from Mr's May's that I've yet to open. I cannot believe they are stating they're a all natural healthy snack. Who even knows what's really in them!
1,Disappointing,"This book was to me a complete waste of time. It contains everything from the physiology of the inner ear, the brain, to Beethoven, and the theme from the Pink Panther; scattered facts with no coherency what so ever. It presents no new facts, and not even any new ideas. The author never asks himself the question 'Why is this important?' For example: It is mentioned that the reason why an interval is dissonant is because it falls within a socalled 'critical band' of hearing. That might be interesting trivia, but does it add anything to our understanding of music? I think not. At one point the author writes 'Fortunately you don't need to understand the brain to be able to use it'. Exactly! So what is the point of this book? Music is an emotional and spiritual experience. The author has once and for all proven that looking for musical enlightment via a pseudo-scientific discourse as impossible as trying to locate the human soul by brain surgery, and as meaningless."
5,A must to re-read!,"Jourdain's background as a musician and man of science allows him to cover a subject that pleases both right and left-brained readers. He logically unfolds the story of music from its simplest form as soundwave to the complex nature which allows music to ""touch"" our souls. I have fresh appreciation of music as a gift which no one, least of all musicians, should ever take for granted."
3,The psychology of music as seen by a musical bigot,"While an interesting read, I found Jourdain's book frequently annoyed for the same reasons that, in retrospect, I now realize my junior high music snob phase annoyed. For a few years there, I listened to nothing but Western classical music of about 1500 to 1900. I reveled in my superior taste. Thank goodness I got that out of my system at an early age. Mr. Jourdain seems never to have outgrown it. His constricted musical tastes made him to lose credibility with me when he moved from areas with which he clearly resonates (harmony and mainstream Western classical music) to those that do comparatively little for him (rhythm, non-Western music, modern music, jazz, rock, the list goes on and on). The book is most interesting for what it reveals about the author, not for what it tells us about music."
2,MUST BE A MUSICIAN TO UNDERSTAND,"IT SEEMS LIKE YOU MUST KNOW A BIT ABOUT MUSIC TOO FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS.I'M NOT A MUSICIAN, BUT ENJOY MUSIC A LOT AND HAVE READ OTHER BOOKS ON MUSIC...IT JUST SEEMED TOO TECHNICAL. BUT ITS PROBABLY PERFECT FOR SOMEONE WHO KNOWSA THING OR TWO ABOUT MUSIC...I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND ""YOUR BRAIN ON MUSIC"" IF YOU CANT READ MUSIC....This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession"
1,"""Music, The Brain, And Ecstasy""=""Science, Science, Science""","Robert Jourdain's ""Music, The Brain, And Ecstasy"" is not a book to read for enjoyment, it is rather a book to read for information. It is a textbook containing the physics of sound waves, the biology of the brain, and the psychology of music. The word music does not even belong in the title. The word music implies enjoyment. Robert Jourdain provides no enjoyment in the book whatsoever. He overloads the reader with far too much information, even for someone as interested in science as me. Jourdain is also closed minded on the subject of music. He thinks that the only good music is classical music, and while he does not say this directly, its implication is very strong. Jourdain doesn't even mention any other styles of music other than classical. If a writer wants to discuss music, shouldn't he discuss the various styles of music? All in all, Robert Jourdain's misleading title and prejudice in music make for a very poor book."
3,Good read,"This is a very ""thin"" magazine but it packs a lot of very weighty information in it. I bought this as a gift for my Father and he has really enjoyed it."
5,Nation Magazine,I have a traditional subscription to the Nation. My Kindle version won't start until my regular subscription runs out. Sorry!
1,when will it ever come,I don't think I will ever buy magazines from Amazon again. It is 4/22/10 and I ordered this back in March. I regularly have around 20 magazines subscriptions and I have never waited so long to get my first copy.
3,Intelligence is not enough - judgment and perspective are required,The 'Nation' is the best intellectual political journal of the Left. Its articles are very often informative and comprehensive in scope. It is possible to learn much from them.But the Nation's political bias is so far to the Left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the American and world - situation.
1,Terrible service,"I'd love to read The Nation and give a review based on content, but in the two and a half months since I subscribed, I've received two issues, several weeks apart. I have, however, received several demands for payment. Yesterday when they claimed they'd sent eight issues, I told them to cancel the subscription. If their service is that bad, I can do without it."
1,No magazine after more than 3 months!!!,I ordered The Nation MORE than 3 months ago and I still haven't received an issue. I made numerous calls to Amazon.com and the company they use to process. The Nation customer service has no record of a subscription. This is the first and last time I ever order a magazine subscription through Amazon.com. I will demand a refund soon if I do not get an issue and it having the correct expiration date of a year later. Outrageous!
3,Repackaged material under a different name...,"This is nothing more than repackaged material by A&E; and the History Channel.What you get is 4 discs spanning the entire age old Victory At Sea series, and 4 discs spanning the entire series of Hero Ships by the History Channel.A&E; lists the bonus features as ""Introductions of Victory At Sea episodes by Peter Graves"".If you don't already have these two series, it might be worth $13 to get them together. Otherwise, save your money!"
5,The best Christmas movie I've ever seen,"Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees, many friends and I have been looking for this movie FOREVER, does anyone know when it will be out on DVD?I cannot understand why there are so many boring Christmas cartoon and 'science fiction' Christmas stories and this wonderful movie is not out for sale ....... who can help us with this?"
5,the best movie I've ever cried over,"I agree this is the best movie. I have also looked high and low for it, even got scammed on ebay by someone selling pirated copies off the TV. Watch out--- he also sold them here on Amazon for a while. I did find out that this is now a Disney property. Wrote them by email. They have no plans to release it at this time. I feel a letter writing campaign coming on....Are you listening Disney???"
5,One of the best Christmas movies EVER made!,"i love this movie so much, it's heart warming and magical and whimsical and just all around wonderful, this guy is looking for the perfect christmas tree for rockafella plaza and is having no luck, but on his way back to the city he sees the perfect tree, he goes to find out who owns it and it turns out that it's on the property of a nunnery and is very very special to one elderly nun in particular, the movie tells the story of the nuns life and why that tree is so special to her, i don't want to say more to give anything away but trust me when i say this is a great movieplease please please someone release this on DVD!! i'll buy five!"
5,works just fine,"very happy with these, my cord was damaged/ frayyed on the original and this has worked well for over 1 year now.i use my laptop basically as a PC now, too cheap to get a new, expensive battery :)"
4,"Intense and difficult, but good","I'm new to the whole XBox scene so my current definition of difficult may change with playing experience, but I'll say this is a hard game to play. While you may be able to run through some parts without doing anything, when you play it out, it's intense. The graphics are incredible, the action intense and the story is okay. My major disappointment is the lack of coorperative play in the campaign. My daughter bought this for my birthday and when we went to play in co-op, like Halo 3, found it non-exisitent. This was a real downer.I would like to see more XBox 360 games designed with co-op play against good AI and not just for the XBox Live arena."
2,pretty but...,This game is awsome to look at but as far as game play look somewhere else. you can run through the stages to the boss and not fight anything inbetween. it gets old realy REAlY fast. Again Graphicaly this game is one of the best there is on xbox 360 (It realy is). but the game itself sucks. so if you are looking for eye candy boy this is the game for you. if you are looking for a good game (like me) pass on it.
5,I wish I could find more of this toy,"I bought this with one of the battle games, it has povided many hours of fun for my boys 6 and 8. They made these before my boys became consumed with Pokemon. I only wish I could find more of them. If your child loves to pretend like he's battleing with the action figures this is the perfect toy for them. It helps them learn when and what attacks to use. The trading card game was to confuseing for my 6 year old, but he picked up on these quickly and in no time was beating his older brother."
1,Classic Style Council,"There isn't a lot of Style Council product available domestically, especially on DVD, so it was with great anticipation that I ordered this disc...and I wasn't disappointed! The song selection offers a nice overview of TSC career, and there were some nice surprises such as ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" and ""Life At A Top People's Health Farm"". Although some of the videos are cheesy when compared to today's more slick videos, it is nonetheless a fine piece for any Paul Weller fan."
3,Disappointed,"Although I do like the set, the design is so much lighter than the picture.At first I thought I received the wrong set.It is one of the prettier corelle dish sets but is not near as pretty as the picture."
4,Intermediating Delphi 3?,"This is a nice book for beginners or programmers at the intermediate level, but it doesn't cover anything too advanced. It's not quite ""mastering"" Delphi 3. Also, maybe they've fixed it, but I purchased this book right after it was published and the index is completely wrong. The topics listed in the index are correct, but the page numbers it points you to is completely incorrect, which renders the book about useless as a ""quick reference""."
1,Begginers: save your money!!!,"This book shows you what Delphi can do. It doesn't show you how you can do it!!. If you want to learn Delphi or the database environment you need other book (I'M still locking for one).Finally, I beg your pardon for the one star score. I couldn't find how to put -5 stars!!!"
4,Not as good as what I have heard....,"This book certainly covers a lot of topics of Delphi's VCL and has a really good introduction to OOP programming. However, the text and the language the author used are not very understandable or not very friendly. The examples the author used are not very clear and well explained. Some text and techniques in this book are way too ""wordy"" and hence create a number of confusions. If you are a beginner, I suggest you to skip some parts of the OOP programming chapters since it's far too confusing and difficult to read. Thank you for your attention."
4,avanti marco!,"Although it is a huge book all its pages are revealing. It elucidates Delphi 3 in the way no other Delphi book has done. Some code examples are eye-popping. It is well written and organized. It sits firmly on my work desk, other books are doorstops. Perhaps the book aims at too broad a spectrum of readers -- some more focus at the higher end would have been a plus."
4,Great Read Aloud,I chose this book as a read aloud for my sixth grade social studies class as we studied ancient Egypt. It's a little complicated--there are lots of characters and different time periods. I put a poster on the wall with the character names and a few details and that helped a lot. The kids loved it. Everyday they would come in and ask if we were going to read. I would recommend it. Just be ready to check for understand often.
2,Disappointing End to Good Series,"After a several-year wait, I found For All Time and was happy that another Time book had been written.However, the story disappointed hugely. My biggest beef with the story was Annie going back to ancient Egypt. The point? I didn't see one. And really, I didn't need another oppressed girl 'finding herself' as Renifer did. In fact, the entire Renifer story was unnecessary and frankly, a bit boring.I truly, truly hated the end, as it went completely out of sync with Annie's character in the other three novels. She has this life-altering experience and shrugs her shoulders over it? There's no way anyone could go through what she went through and be that blase. I got the feeling Ms. Cooney painted her characters into a corner and didn't feel like fleshing out a plausible ending."
5,Good Book,I have enjoyed this writer and this series of books. I would recommend this book to others.
2,bad ending,"This book was just O.K.I was so excited to read the last book, and was very dissapointed.There was too much of camilla and renifer, and not enough of the main characters.The ending was very bad! I was sooooooo confused! Was Strat born again? Will anny forget about the old strat and take the second strat? What was the deal about the sand in the watch? How did the second strat have a dream that he was floating on the nile? My other friend couldn't figure this out either. The book would of been good if it diddn't have that ending."
5,A Time to Reflect,"I have read many books on whales over the course of my lifetime but I have never been so inspired by any book as much as I have from reading ""Sightings"". The book brings out the whales relationship with mankind. The qualities demonstrated by both are compassion and understanding and love. These qualities are perhaps the only qualities worth acquiring in life because they are the only qualities that not be destroyed by death. The murder of innocence or the rescue of it are the two sides of mankind that are brought out in these pages of events. This is a must read for those needing the courage to continue onward towards eventual reconciliation of intelligent souls."
4,Mysterious and moving,"Marjorie Hudson links together three stories like a braid in this moving blend of fiction, memoir, and nonfiction. Virginia Dare's mysterious disappearance taps into our most primal fears of loss of loved ones but even worse, loss of a loved one in a stituation of ""not-knowing."" Hudson's intriguing narrative structure actually mimics what the human brain does during a disappearance: it tries to find facts and in the absence of facts, begins to speculate until a new story is formed. Brilliant writing. And a fascinating exploration into the world of the human heart and mind."
2,Pretentious and silly.,"You've heard the adage""Nothing new under the sun."" Well,there's nothing new about Virginia Dare{my surname}in this self-indulgent book which is little than a shameless advertisement of the writer's ""deep thinking"". Virginia Dare becomes little more than an instrument to provide us with her searing observations during a motor trip. If you are looking for information leading to the colony's disappearance,this is not the book for you. I really don't know what value it has for anyone except the author's ego. If you're searching for Virginia Dare, read Lee Miller's excellent book on the subject. You'll find her there."
5,The best machine quilting DVD I've ever seen,"This DVD is by far the best I've ever seen on this subject. Barbara is a true fiber artist on the sewing machine. Everyone from beginner to advanced quilter can find something new to learn about machine quilting. Barbara starts with the basics of choosing materials, thread and needles. She then explains how to decide on which quilting stitches to use to match the design you are using. When done with the basics, she spends time showing each machine quilting stitch in great detail. The trunk show alone will inspire you to go on to creating great quilts on your own. Her work is fantastic and beyond the realm of the ordinary.I've never been confident in my machine quilting, but since buying this video, I'm amazed at what I can now accomplish. I'm even thinking of entering one of my machine quilted pieces into a juried show."
4,An Excellent Start,"This physically lovely volume, beautifully bound (it even has a red ribbon bookmark), is a great start for anyone interested in the short fiction of Maugham. These days Maugham is rather underrated, which is all the more unfortunate because his short works, unlike many of his novels, are more consistently well-crafted and engaging. This collection is first rate, although some of Maugham's best stories (e.g. ""The Facts of Life"" and ""Lord Montdrago"") are curiously absent (as they are from many incomplete collections). If you're looking for the complete short stories, obviously this isn't the volume for you, but if you want a large compilation of most of this writer's work, this is an excellent start."
2,Beware - nowhere near complete,"I have bought Everyman collections before (two Waugh books - travels and short stories). The editions are attractive and seem to be durable.The title of this book is misleading. Nowhere in the Amazon description or in the book itself is it made clear that this is a selection, not a complete collection, of the short stories. I would estimate that well under half of Maugham's stories are here. A complete set is available in four volumes from Penguin.The fact that Everyman sells a book that appears to be a complete collection but is not is irritating and makes me wonder about the completeness of the other collections I have bought from this publisher. I returned this book to Amazon and will not buy Everyman books again."
2,Improperly Titled,"This book is not really properly titled -- it should be ""Using Scripting to Make PowerPoint Interactive."" The author makes it clear (part way through the book) that he is not writing this for people with programming knowledge -- all he intends for you to do is copy the scripts he provides and use them as he intends. He even discourages the reader to read what little is written about programming.In addition, the $45 price tag is ludicrously high. This book is worth $19.95 tops."
4,"Useful, not so different from previous edition","I've used the previous edition to good ends in making interactive quizzes [sightwords, math problems etc.] for my kids.I have also used it to create interactive experiments for Graduate students to present stimuli [pictures, sounds] and gather the data into Excel spreadsheets for analysis.Good book, good tips for making PowerPoint a more useful tool."
1,Powerless PowerPoint,"As there seems to be a lack of material dealing with VBA in the PowerPoint world, this looked interesting. At close to $50.00, one would expect a comprehensive text on the subject. I went through the book in just over an hour because it contains very little useful information. The basic tasks it sets forward are bettered served not using VBA. The information which would have been valuable, ie. exposing useful methods and properties are not there. If you are looking for some really good examples of how to use VBA or other technical information on this very complex Microsoft Tool, this is not it. And the author and publisher should be ashamed asking so much for so little."
2,It has run it's course... listen first!,"I am a bit disappointed. Seems that Claude ""theme"" CD's have run their course and that he keeps looking for exotic destinations to add house and trip hop beats. This album is just that - a re-hash of what's been done before just with a Middle Eastern influence. Just like Nirvana Lounge which targeted Indian influenced beats, Near Eastern Lounge has the typical beats you've come know but in an almost plagiaristic way - I can't help but recall B-Tribe during some songs and Claude's own previous work in others - definitely the most contrived CD to date. Good thing I purchased in on sale but that's still the price of a good burrito here in Manhattan..."
1,"Basically, nothing.","This bag is poorly constructed. Very thin and flimsy material. Wouldn't put any equipment in it. I definitely learned my lesson from this purchase, you get what you pay for. Spend extra $10 and get Lowepro instead! I did and am so much happier."
2,does not work properly,received the product in a box that was damaged in transit. called the postal authorities and filed a claim but did not receive any response from them. The connecting cord was missing. The ink in the printer was dry. Does not print.
2,Piece of Junk Printer,I bought this printer 1.5 years ago - and it died while still in warranty. Dell sent a replacement - and the replacement died too! the printer just starts blinkng and will not print. now I am out of warranty and am going to look for a HP or Brother printer.
3,"Slow, very slow","This printer has very low cost per page according to independent reviews. I looked for it based on those reviews. I found it for a very nice low price. It does a very good job with all functions and is perfectly adequate for my purposes, but it is slow in the extreme. I replaced a Lexmark X73 which was much faster, but had to be reinstalled everytime it ran out of paper in the middle of a printing job. I had NO trouble finding ink on the Dell website. It is very inexpensive if it gives me the number of copies it says it will. (much less expensive than the Lexmark) It took me 5 minutes to print one page of mixed color images and text. I can live with it, but there must be a way to get both low cost and adequate speed."
