2,Not A Good Guide To Monkey Around,"Sometimes, a guide can be well worth its wait in gold, or bananas. That reall isn't the case from this guide. The Prima guide for Donkey Kong Country, the maps here aren't as detailed here as the original one Nintendo created for the Game Boy Advance, or even the original one Nintendo devloped for the Super Nintendo back in 1993. Arguably here, the maps aren't really set properly and just shows segments here, and can be very difficult at certain times. Nevertheless, it just shows that third-party guides aren't the right way to go. If you have Donkey Kong Country for the Game Boy Advance, get the guide from Nintendo instead. You'll beat the game much easier from that book."
3,Too bad they didn't make it..,"I picked up on these guys back in the late 80's, I don't know how, when, or why.. Like a lot of things back then it just seemed to happen. Needless to say, the cassette didn't make it, but the music and the group stuck with me. This is an album (actually a 2fer) that I sought out to have in my music collection again. Kelly Breznick has the right sound. Get it!"
4,sawzall,"Never big on buying reconditioned. If not stated would not have known this tool was not brand new. Used a much smaller Milwaukee sazall in the late 70's early 80's for remodel HVAC one tough tool It just wouldn't wear out. This one seems as good or better, This is one BIG HEAVY TOUGH TOOL. Would not want to use for extended period of time its just that big and heavy, if not needed to demolish buildings and cut vehicles to pieces etc. I would recomend a smaller lighter ""Milwaukee"" sazall. This was one of my better purchases."
4,Gary Hoyt,"I have had and used Milwaukee tools including the Sawzall for yrs. I own the Sawzall and only gave it four stars because the operating switch is a fatgue factor if your using the saw for an extended length of time. The switch needs to be re-designed and made longer. Other than that, it is a great, tough saw.Sawzall for sale @$350.00+? (Amazon) Check it out before ordering this re-con saw. I have my doubts."
4,Spring Float Cool Hawaii,"I ordered the Hibiscus Stripe but received a different color and pattern. Didn't want the hassel of sending it back so I kept it. It folds up easily and inflates without difficulty. Overall, it is a comfortable product for relaxing in the pool. Just wish they had sent the right color/pattern."
2,float,"All I can say is that this float is ""OK"", but priced too high. I can buy the same thing at Wal Mart for 15 dollars. I would not order one again."
4,Looking good,"My 11 year old talked me into buying this. After it arrived, he put it on. It was a little too big (long) for his head. I bent it to fit a little better (carefully) and now it looks rather awesome. Whe it arrives it is almost flat nad sticks out on the sides. After a little bending which has to be done carefully, it fits well and looks cool.He wears it when he is playing video games, and it gives him a different personna. If your sons head is narrow, it will require a little bending."
3,Fast Service,Units were received in a fast manner and were very well packaged. They work as advertised. Am quite pleased with overall transaction.
4,Pretty Useful,"Good price, easy installation, and it seems to do what it's supposed to. As noted in other reviews, the instruction sheet for this product is lacking --- it doesn't indicate what possible combinations of LED lighting may signify.I installed the controller with a 15W solar panel also purchased through Amazon. The yellow LED stays lit continuously and the red LED that should indicate a full charge never appears. However, the battery appears to stay fully charged. We just returned from a week long camping trip in Eastern Oregon and never once had to run the generator to top off the battery. We only run lights each night for a few hours and a propane reefer. It probably also helps that we simultaneously installed a deep cycle battery.So far, I'm totally satisfied with this purchase and recommend it for basic solar installations such as ours."
1,don't buy sunforce products,I bought this wind turbine from them that cost me a whopping 650 dollars. it spun fast but produced little to no energy. They said that my wind speeds weren't fast enough. I say they ripped me off. I couldn't return it because it took me awhile to install it and troubleshoot it.
2,not recommended,"This unit is simply an electronic switch, it is either on or off. The problem with that is that when it is on the full force of a high current is applied to the battery and if the battery is almost charged the battery voltage quickly rises to the cut-off voltage (14.2v). When current is cut off the battery voltage quickly falls to the turn on voltage (13.1v), and the unit turns the current on again. This can happen several times a minute when the current is high and the battery is almost charged. Also, in operating this way, the battery never gets fully charged, which requires a small constant current.I strongly recommend that anyone considering this unit spend another $10 and buy the vastly superior HQRP 10Amp controller or something similar which controls the amount of current, rather than just switching current on or off."
5,solar panel voltage regulator,Functions just as advertised-please see my other reviews to see what you can use it for. Much better than jury-rigging an old auto voltage regulator as it automatically protects from overcharge or overload. A car regulator will fry unless its an old fashioned electro-mechanical and that would be less efficient than this product. Great item!
3,sunforce 7 amp charge controller,"This charge controller works as any voltage regulator does. I use it to regulate a 10 watt solar panel that maintains the charge on a gate opener battery. Would have rather been told in the product description that it was not weather proof. Had to seal the case where the front & back meet. Since it works as advertised, will use it until the circuit board corrodes and fails."
1,Sun force 7 amp charge controller,"It worked fine for 2 weeks, then it just died. I'm disappointed and will return it for credit, and purchase another brand. My panel is working, it's the controller for sure.It's frustrating when you buy something to do a job and you can't rely on it! Plus the hassle of returning it, and waiting for another unit to be sent. The second one made it 6 months. Not impressive performance!"
2,This will not work well for most batteries,"The cords are too short for most applications. This charger will not work for most batteries. It says it will keep charging until the battery is 14.2 volts. This is too high of a voltage for car batteries and deep cycle marine/RV batteries. I am not sure what batteries charge that high. This will result in the battery being overcharged. I am not happy with this charger because I can't use it, it will ruin my battery due to overcharging."
4,Thanks Amazon for suggesting a product I didn't need !!!!,"I CAN'T RATE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T NEED IT. UNFORTUNATELY I MADE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING IT BECAUSE AMAZON HAD IT LISTED IN THIER ""BETTER TOGETHER"" SECTION (JUST BELOW THE PRODUCT INFORMATION SECTION). APPARENTLY I DIDN'T NEED THIS CHARGE CONTROLLER WITH THE Sunforce 50012 1.8 Watt Solar Battery Maintainer. I FOUND THIS OUT AFTER READING THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE CHARGE CONTROLLER, WHEN I RECIEVED IT.I USUALLY RESEARCH MY PURCHASES THOROUGHLY. THIS TIME I TRUSTED AMAZON. I WILL NOT DO THAT AGAIN!NOTE: I ONLY GAVE THIS A 4 STAR RATING BECAUSE I COULDN'T SUBMIT A REVIEW WITHOUT THE RATING (4 STARS IS THE CURRENT AVERAGE RATING)."
4,no brainer,"works great! I have it set up on my pop-up camper, controlling the charge from a 65W solar panel on the roof to the marine battery. Mounted the controller inside a weatherproof housing. green lights up when full charge is reached, yellow when charging."
4,Simple and effective,"I use this with my Duracell 300 Powerpack and a little solar roof I whipped with some found materials up for my garden pagoda. It works like a charm, keeping that battery healthy and not overcharged.I actually bought this thinking that my previous one had gone bad from spending a wet winter getting rained on. It kept showing both the green ""charged"" and yellow ""charging"" lights as on; it turns out my DC charger cable went bad, not the charge controller! Once I replaced that bunk cable the old Sunforce controller worked great as well."
4,Solar Controller,I installed this item with my solar panel and the two work well together. It was an easy setup and install.
2,"Had to send it back, awaiting a new one","It died hooked to one Sunforce 15 watt solar panel, after 2 weeks (the unit was indoors! Their RMA service seemed good, but I'm wondering when I will get my new unit."
4,Sunforce Vs Sunguard,"Am installing solar cells on several sailboats. The sunforce was cheaper, had a higher amp rating (7amp vs 4.5 amp). It also has a charging as well as full charge indicator. The Sunguard did not. Will be purchasing again."
3,"A handy ""light""",Seems to work ok ! I have it connected to a deep cell boat battery and after a few days light told me it was at a full charge so I put a volt meter on it to check and sure enough there was 12 + volts .
4,Simple...and it works with 100 watts!,"I think that the quality control on these units is much better that that noted on some of the reviews for this product dated a few years ago. I have it hooked up to two 50-watt panels in parallel and it works just great. Auto on and off and you know when your batteries are relatively full. I say ""relatively"" as it tends to kick off at just over 14 volts and on again at just over 13. This isn't a problem if hooked up to a low watt panel (say, 10 or 15 watts), but does tend to kick off and on a lot if you are planning on using anywhere near it's rated capacity of 7 amps. This makes it so you tend to loose that ""trickle charge"" to top off your battery the last 10% or so, except during mornings and late afternoons when the panels are putting out less power.I recommend this as a good, simple and cheap but reliable product."
5,Seems to be working OK,Have been using it several months and it is working OK. We have some huge summer thunderstorms which sometimes take out electronics but this has survived them.
2,Switching controller,I returned this controller because it had limited charging features. I prefer the Pulse Width Modulation feature offered by slightly more expensive controllers.
4,Sunforce 7 Charge Controller,"The unit performs as advertised and, mercifully, has input polarity reversal protection. Improvements would be using screw-on terminals (instead of short wires), and it could use larger LEDs."
4,Pictures can be deceiving,This product works very well and the customer support was excellent. The photos indicate that the device is connected via screw terminals located under a cover at the bottom of the device. In actuality there are wires leading to battery terminal ring connectors on the load side and wires that need to be spliced to the line or solar panell side.
5,A MUST FOR BEGINNER SOLAR PANEL USERS,This keeps your 12volt battery from over charging. The first one I have had connected for 1 year now and it works as it should. for 12 volt panel up to aprox. 70 watts. Green LED means your battery is full. Yellow LED means the sun is now charging your battery. Both LEDs lit or flashing means your battery connection is bad. No LEDs lit means bad connection or no sun. This happens at dusk of course.
2,Lasts 12 months,"I've gone through two of these Sunforce 7A solar battery charge controllers in two years, maintaining a battery on a box trailer with about 4-5A of solar panel max current.These units seem to work fine for a while and then just go dark after about a year or so.Quite convenient as the warranty is one year.I'm going to another brand and not spending any more $$ with Sunforce."
4,Sunforce 7 Amp Charge Controller,"I used this Sunforce 7 Amp charge controller on an RV installation earlier this year to connect three Sunforce 6-Watt solar panels, [18-Watts total] for trickle charging the RV's two deep cycle 12V batteries. Wiring connection was simple and straight forward. The controller is small in size light weight which makes it easier to mount it in tight areas. The controller is made in China and I don't believe this unit is supposed to be weatherproof or water resistant, but that was not an issue for me since it was mounted it in a dry location under the bench seat for the fold-down dining table, which is also directly behind the battery compartment. All in all, from my experience anyway, I think this is a decent little unit considering the price. So far, it's been working great and has kept the RV batteries charged all summer."
3,"ok, but not if you require max power over the day from te array",This reg meets spec's but the bang-bang nature will not extract the max power from the array over the day. It will protect your batteries from over charging. It charges till the bat reaches 14 v and then just sits there till the voltage drops to 13 before turning on again. Not the best arrangement for RV use when trying to get max back into the batteries.
2,barely acceptable -- poor connections -- pulls off easily,"I can only say I bought this elsewhere last year and it worked ok what little I used it, but almost impossible to keep the wires connected to the charge controller. Any little bump and they want to pull loose. The sunforce solar panels I bought -- 15 Watt Amorphous set -- seem good and the connectors are easy -- not sure why they jury-rig you to bare wire to the charge controller rather than their very good modular connections for the panels and to link the panels together. If anyone knows if the larger Sunforce charge controllers are better I hope you post on those -- I'm going to go look."
2,Poor Performance,Purchased this through Radio Shack initially. It seemed to work ok for about 6 months to keep a 420 cca battery on my standby generator charged before it went out and fried the battery. I had it coupled to a 45 watt panel 17 volt max output or about 3 amp max solar panel output. I would not recommend this unit.
3,NOT THE QUALITY I EXPECTED,"these are not bad,but theyre plastic(not metal) and made overseas..they get the job done,but i guess i figured the name meant more. i honestly wouldnt buy these again because i could buy chicom screwdrivers for dirt cheap anywhere"
2,how long it lasted and return policy,"i bought the replacement lamp on oct 21st. i received it on time. i had it for 90 days and put 350 hours on it. guess what it went boom, not within the 30 day return policy,they said at ELECTRIFIED, i am sorry but we cannot help. thirty days is not enough time."
1,Poor Quality Product,"Do not purchase this product. When I received the item and installed it the lamp lasted 10 minutes and blew out. I contacted customer service for Electrified (where the product comes from) and the rep acted as if this happened all the time and was not surprised. After being rather rude to me, she gave me a return authorization number. I had to pay to shipped the defective product myself. I guess sometimes it is worth paying more for better quality. Lesson learned."
1,Misrepresentations,"I agree with Mr. Mitchell that these are falsely represented as OEM lamps from Optoma. I am in the process of trying for a refund - the bulb didn't even turn on in the projector. The projector was functioning perfectly when the last bulb finished its predicted life. The seller was extremely anxious that I remove my negative comments and repeatedly requested their removal. If other dissatisfied individuals have removed their negative comments already, a balanced set of reviews may not even be available and people will continue to get burned. However, the seller did post a full refund (incl shipping) back onto my credit card, when I shipped the lamp back."
1,Worked for only 72 hours.,Everything seemed fine and normal. I popped the bulb in and it worked ok for about an hour before it started to overheat. I have a bigass fan sitting around so I opened the window and pointed it at the projector. It lasted another month and finally burned out with the bulb lifespan of only 72 hours.Amazon has been awesome in assisting me with my return and full refund. I am mailing the bulb back as we speak.
1,I sent it back and I would like a refund.,"The lamp did not work. I came on for about 5 to 10 minutes then went off again. After the happeded several times, I brought an audio video technician in and he saw the same thing. He then indicated that he felt the lamp was defective.I have mailed it back, and I have requested a refund."
4,Great bulb,"I bought this bulb back in March of 2009 - I now have 3,150 hours on it and finally decided to replace it as it was getting a bit dim during the daytime.Obviously I watch a lot of TV and movies, but for the price I will be ordering another from Amazon when I need a new bulb!Great product - great price!"
2,This is NOT an OEM Phoenix bulb and is poor quality,"The original bulb for this is a Phoenix shp69. If it's not a PHOENIX shp 69 ag, then it's not oem and is chinese crap. I tried ordering one of these at the default price of $80 but the seller told me it was a ""compatible replacement"". Compatible replacement bulbs will burn out in a few months time, whereas the original OEM bulb will last for what is originally stated in the manual. Be SURE to ask the seller first."
2,Not pleased,"The frame itself was alright but the hardware was horrible. Wouldn't hang a straight pin with the hooks in the kit and not sure all the corner pieces were right, either. Looked on their website and found that wanting, too. Never mind, went to Hobby Lobby which was equal quality for less money...AND, they had extra bags of parts which included a better hanging system....2 fit in hooks on the sides of the frame. Live and learn."
4,Great Resource,"Leahy does an excellent job into giving us a day to day impression inside RTC, Great Lakes. I was recommended to read this book from the experienced Sailors in the military.com forums. Not only did it answer some of the smaller detailed questions that you may not find on the Navy websites, it gave me an understanding of what the recruits of Division 005 went through, psychologically and physically.I'm shipping off to RTC in about 5 months and I'm glad I picked up a copy of this book (as well as the Bluejacket's Manual - even though we'll be getting our own copies at boot camp). From a DEP recruit's perspective, I feel these two titles will give me an advantage of what to expect at boot camp as well as general Navy knowledge (the BJM)."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I bought this book for my son who is supposed to enter the Navy in January. I'm in the Navy and I know this is the place for a kid who's not quite ready for college. I would have like to see color pictures and more of them. Most high school kids won't want to sit and read all the text without decent pics to keep it exciting.
3,Disappointed,"Enjoyed reading the book, howver it is quite obvious special attention was awarded to the recruits while Leahy was there observing Great Lakes to write this book. I just had a son graduate on August 10, 2007 and trust me things are quite different than the book portrays."
2,Navy Boot Camp,"I was disappointed with this book. I believe it needs to be updated since it was written in the early 2000's and changes have been make, for example recruits no longer work the chow hall. I found some websites to be more informative of the Boot Camp process. Also did not care for the method of presentation....a bunch of interviews with recruits and instructors. I wanted to know more detail about what my recruit would be doing....it is not in this book."
5,Excellent,"tHIS BOOK IS JUST EXCELLENT !! eASY TO USE, A FULL GRAPHIC TEACHING BOOK FOR BEGINNERS AND ADVANCED USERS. a MUST HAVE IF YOU'RE USING MATHEMATICA."
1,Poor Guide,"Yes there are neat pictures in this book and loads ofmathematica code.But that's it: no attempt is made to educate the reader: no list of important graphics programming paradigms, general strategies, etc.This book fails dramatically to meet the high standard set bythe marvelous ""mathematica book"".The many bugs and common work-arounds of the mathematica graphics system are not discussed at all.I would have wished a chapter about what is NOT possible withmathematica - such a chapter would have saved me a lot of timewasted in searching.If you really want to do graphics programming, forget about this book and check the excellent mathematica usegroup instead."
3,So-so,"I read this book after having read ""Myra Hindley - One Of Your Own"", so this was a bit of a disappointment. ""One Of Your Own"" was excellent, so this book had big shoes to fill.This book deals mainly with Myra's life in prison, revealing details about her many love affairs with female inmates and the friends she made who supported her in her quest for parole. I was a bit annoyed after reading this book, because even though she spent 35 years in prison, her life behind bars seemed...pretty good.A thin book (I read it quickly), this book is good if you are specifically interested in Myra Hindley's life after the crimes and her arrest, and juicy bits of gossip regarding her love life. However, if you are interested in her life or the case as a whole, I would recommend ""One Of Your Own""."
1,Lacking - but may have potential with revisions!,"I believe the author has good intentions and the seven main principles do look good on paper. However, I found that trying to work this plan into my life simply created one more headache. (I'm sure some might hint that the downfall was my own inadequacy rather than that of the principles!)I also have difficulty with the amount of time this author spends, whether in books or in a conference settings, on telling her own personal tales. Autobiographies have their place, but should be labeled as such.This particular book might be used along with other resources, to obtain the results it hopes to lead to: organizational skills, defining life purpose, etc., but is not adequate in and of itself at this point."
5,Review of Alien Nation - Ultimate Movie Collection,This is an excellent DVD. The movies are very good and these help wrap up the series in an excellent way.
3,AILEN NATION,"I didn't get to see the series when it was on TV so it was all new to me - it was interesting and I like the play between characters as well as some of the social issues they covered. Not the best Sci-Fi I've seen, but certainly not the worst either - I could have easily watched a few more seasons!"
1,No 5th movie.,Don`t Buy this. The movies are more graphic and lessfun then the show. The Collection said 5 movies I onlygot 4!!!. There is no side B on the 3rd disc.
4,Nice set but...,"Currently you can pick this up at Best Buy for under 40 so don't get ripped off. It's a three disc set with the first movie on a single side disc. Unfortunately the other 4 movies are on double sided discs. Each movie has a making of and most have a gag reel. I took off one star for the double sided discs, otherwise it's a great set."
3,NO LYRICS SHEET?,"This is my 5th or 6th copy of this album. 1st time I bought it was in 1979. It's 1 of the CDs I'll either wear out or misplace since I refer to it often. The 4 bands represented here are amazing and do some of the most highly-original-sounding music I've ever heard in my life.This is a nice copy. It's my 1st CD copy that has ever had a 3-pane foldout cover. MY ONLY COMPLAINT is that this edition of the album has no lyrics sheet. The lyrics to this particular album are an essential part of the experience. Leaving out the lyrics sheet is an egregious oversight on the part of those responsible for releasing this edition of ""No New York"". The bands and the music, I rate a solid 5 STARS, easily. The packaging of this edition, as sumptuous as it is, gets 2 points out of 5 off for leaving out the lyrics sheet.Sitting down with the LP of this and reading the words to the songs as I listened, was mind-blowing, and has gone down as one of my most memorable life experiences."
5,More for the Grown and Sexy,What can I say this is the mello most chill out music I've heard... I have all seasons and they all just gets me in the right mood to chill
1,Toby Ross fans praise the emperor's new clothes.,"I relied on the first review of this video [in favor] when deciding to buy it. I didn't receive what it described, because it's no relation to the avant garde and underground arthouse that give to you visually with skill and imagination. Those prove low budget is no excuse to produce crap.This whole bile-producing disappointment suffers from the Pathetic Fallacy. You don't show that something is gritty by making a viewer sit through frames full of bad sound, ugly acting, and grainy scenes. Think of the filmSin City. It's gritty but it's beautiful, interesting, and memorable, too.Sometimes you get skill without imagination; sometimes imagination without skill. When you're lucky you get both, you get art. This is what you get without either."
2,kinda cheesy...,"I understand that it is a low budget flick, but the story could've been better and the acting was way off the mark. Ricky Sinz really didn't have too much to do for the first 1/2 to 3/4 of the movie and then all of a sudden he figures prominately?!?! And he only flashed his junk once or twice...If you can find a really cheap copy, and it's a boring day check it out. Otherwise rent any porno with Ricky Sinz if he is yoiur main draw..."
5,post poc thrasher punk escapades annnd you love it!,"Need to set the record straight here. This DVD is pretty sweet, and the movie rocks really. Lots of attitude here from the mid 80's street punk scene and some over the top psycho tendencies in the action, it's one of only a few movies that give you that scene. ""Class of 1984"" is another sweet movie in this vein. Also, the original ""Toxic Avenger""."
4,"""Enter the grunge knight""","Except the 2 actors from texas chainsaw massacre, this movie stars people that look like your next door neighbors (from the 80's). Some preppy-new waver-Frats are initiating all night in the worst part of town when they piss off an armored clad killer/psycho (with throwing stars and claws) in charge of a gang of anti-nuke-grunge-new wavers. Fights between the two groups can only be described as the flock of seagulls vs. Nirvana! Although I've never met a fan of this movie, I liked it a lot because once the action starts it doesn't stop. there are also some decent punk rock tunes and impressive gore scenes. The bad acting, 80's attire, and goofy dialog only add to the fun. 16x9 dvd picture is dark but good. Audio is fine"
1,utterly pathetic,"possibly one of the worst dark future/dystopian films i've ever seen. this was a really bad, low budget Revenge of the Nerds knock off mixed with something that i can only guess tried to resemble Escape From New York.Future-Kill is like a Troma movie except without the planned campy laughs, unintentional humor, nudity, innovation, and bad movie charm.the best thing about this movie is the cover and the small poster of the cover image that's included.believe me, i love dark, no budget diamonds in the rough. this isn't one of them, this is just a turd.Darrick"
5,Great Buy,"Great shoe for the price. Compared to other sites, best value offered for a shoe that fits true to size and of good quality. Seller A++ with fast delivery."
4,Remembering a Legend,"I was excited to find this item at a good price (usually see it for $10-20 more). It is the usual Hot Wheels quality die-cast, which I used to think was great until I purchased my first Minichamps die-cast (roughly twice the cost of Hot Wheels, but leaps and bounds better in quality). Looks great on display and is the perfect momento of Schumacher's departing year. It's only upon close inspection where some of the lesser aspects become apparent."
5,Pleased to the gills,I had Received these as a Gift Im a 5'9 inch tall 200 lbs curvy woman and These fit well The material stretches Greatly I am very Pleased with how these Look and feel Excellent product
4,SEXY,"FITS TRUE TO THE SIZE. I found the leg opening to be rather big ,these are not for the skinny leg girls !! I never wear hells but wanted something sexy for the bedroom this did it and after just a few minutes of walking in them I was comfortable !"
5,Domme delicious,These are replacements for My other thigh high boots. Extremely comfortable although the heel is a little on the low side (for Me). For the price these are great! If you have a larger thigh these boots actually s-t-r-e-t-c-h and don't feel tight. I love them paired with a corsette or just about any type of net bodystocking!
5,Douglas Co. makes the best stuffed animals!,"This is such a nice stuffed puppy! It is so realistic, and I can't wait to let my granddaughter play with this sweet dog."
3,Slow.,"When I first got this book I thought that it would be good, something worth reading. Not that it was bad, but the book took way to long to develop into anything. It was very simply, it is simply not wonderful... There wasn't a big calsh, there wasn't something to enchant you, into the book, so you cant put it down. It was just too simple. Though the fighting scenes were well illustrated. I was personaly disapointed."
3,An ok read...,"I expected a lot more than I got from this book. The back cover made it sound like an interesting journey, of a feminist young girl, but ended up sounding like something I would write. (Meaning, it wasn't written very well) A good story, but not for anyone over the age of 11."
5,Good Historical Fiction,"I loved this story when I read it. It had action, British culture, no King Arthur, a strong female character, and believable events. It quickly became one of my favorite books. So imagine my delight when i was working on genealogy and found out that Flaed, the main character, was my many-times-great-grandmother! I have since done research about her, and when I compare it to Tingle's book, I find her facts refreshingly accurate. It's nice to have a good story that is also firmly grounded in historical fact. I highly recommend this book for an interesting and realistic read."
5,Awsome!,"I picked it up at the library to read if I had time. When I got to it I finished it in one day. It had interesting characters and just enough historical fact to make it really hard to put down. I recommend this book to any one who likes 9th and 10th centry england, or just an action filled story with a spunky heroine. Writen for ages 9-12 loved by readers of every age."
4,feel much safer over the flame,"Was a little concerned about ordering these but after using them a few times, I won't fire up without them"
2,"Looks Nice, Too Thin","I bought a pair of these to replace my Kingsford KLT10 grill gloves which had gotten crusted with food and various grill marks over the past three or four years. Based on the reviews, I thought these would be a step up from the Kingsfords but sadly they're not even close. They may look nice and fit very well but I couldn't hang on to a hot grill grate for much more than a second without the heat penetrating through. My trusty Kingsford gloves would only start to get warm after at least ten seconds or so...plenty of time to rearrange or clean a hot grate. I never had any issues with the ""bulk"" of the Kingsford gloves. I was able to grab any grill accessories I needed and the fingers bent easily. Save yourself the return postage and go with the Kingsford KLT10's (linked below). You won't be disappointed.http://www.amazon.com/Outset-KLT10-Kingsford-Grill-Gloves/dp/B001AH8QLW"
3,Steve Raichlen BBQ gloves,Whats nice is that they cover most of the forearm. There were 3 things you shoud know before buying. First they do have a musty smell to them but it could be that they are made out of leather and I've had them in the garage and the smell has decreased. Second the fingers are stiff and seem small but again it's the material the gloves are made of. Third and it might not be a problem. But you can't hold onto a hot pan for more than 5 to 10 minutes. That being said I have used these gloves to handle ribs. They are nice when you have to reach into the grill to wet down the ribs or pull something out. I should have mentioned the gloves come without any care instructions so your on your own.
2,BBQ Gloves,"After reading the review, I bought these for my BBQ guy. Unfortunately, they were WAY too small for guy-hands and too big for mine."
5,Excellent BBQ and Fireplace Gloves,"These are excellent gloves for both the grill and fireplace. They are long (18""), so they cover the entire forearm, and they are heavy duty (thick leather). Also, they are gloves, not mitts, and that makes a huge difference. Mittens give you no ability to grip or pick up items; gloves give you all the flexibility of, well, gloves!My husband has used these everyday for both grilling duties and stocking his fireplace.He is super picky about quality, and these meet his exacting standards.The two 1-star reviews here are not based on this product, but rather on the manufacturer and the shipper. I hope those customers followed up, got their products, and then review the actual gloves."
4,"Good, but not what I expected","I bought these for my husband who barbeque's a lot. He's always complained about getting burned and that normal oven mitts just don't do the job.He barbequed a ""Bud bird"" chicken and was very happy with the heat resistance of these glove. Then he lifted the pan off the grill and carried it into the house. About three feet away from the grill, the heat from the pan started to burn through the gloves.So for a short time span, the gloves are great at resisting the heat, but the heat resistance for a longer period of time is not so great.We didn't expect him to be able to hold super hot things indefinitely, but we were hoping that he could at least carry a hot pan 20 feet to get into the house.The gloves are great at keeping the heat off his hands and forearms while grilling though."
3,A great glove for people without large hands.,"I already owned a pair of these gloves purchased about 3 years ago. They were starting to get warn so I decided to replace them. I ordered them and was surprised when they arrived that I couldn't get my hand into them. The old pair fit fine. I measured them and they were 3/8 inch smaller. I contacted the company and they sent me a pre-paid mailer to return them. The gloves they returned to me were a tiny bit larger (maybe 1/16 inch) and I could get them on my hand with a bit of force. I will keep trying to use them and hope they will stretch a bit.The company was great about trying to solve my problem but there was nothing they could do since the design of the glove had changed. They said they were going to pursue this further with the company that makes the glove. I hope they do because they are great gloves.So, if your hands are on the small to normal size, these are great gloves."
4,my husband likes them a lot,"My husband LOVES to grill.. and he says these gloves are great and protect his hands and forearms from the heat of the grill.I had to deduct a start because when they arrived there was already a rip in the seam on one of the gloves(in between the fingers), so I don't know how sturdy the threading on these gloves are. But we didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back and waiting again for another set.. plus my husband wanted to use them right after he got them. He said the rip didn't bother him and he's still using them."
2,Oven Gloves,"Good looking, nice leatherly feel and good forearm protection but not sufficiently (finger) insulation for oven use or hot from the oven pan handling"
4,Heartwarming odyssey -- good movie!!,"Nine-year old Carlito pines for his absent mother, an illegal immigrant working as a housekeeper in Los Angeles. When his grandmother caretaker suddenly dies, he takes it upon himself to hazard a border crossing in Texas and try to make his way to L.A. to become reunited with his mother. Unaware of his journey, Momma wonders if she should return to Mexico to be with her little boy.The kid playing Carlito puts in a devastating performance. His mother is smokin' hot. Hispanics are not stereotyped here but the Americanos are. Americans are pretty much uniformly portrayed as overbearing or corrupt.Will mother and son become reunited in time? You'll have to watch, but you can probably guess. ."
5,Under the same moon,I am a high school Spanish Teacher. The students in my Spanish 1 class were captivated by the story. Well done. Realistic. Many opportunities to observe living culture. Hits many emotions. Great choice for the classroom. Ideal for providing a basis for exploring the topic of immigration.
5,You will cry at the end,"I saw this movie when it first came out, just recently watched it again, and still felt the same way at the end, I cried because I was so happy. This is a great gift for mom's everywhere. Anyone who knows what moms really go through for their kids, the endless hours they work to put food on the table, to make sure their kids have clothing, and how they suffer when there is something wrong with their child or have to be away from them, will want to see this movie.Others may see the issues with immigrants into the US from Mexico but as I have learned in a recent history class in college, Americans used to cross over into Mexico illegally when they discovered how beautiful Mexicans and Mexico are. They married Mexicans to stay in Mexico before the US army illegally crossed into Mexico and started an illegal war with Mexico, The Mexican - American war. Most of the western half of the US used to be Mexican territory."
3,Not the greatest movie...but its acceptable.,"I took Spanish class in high school, simply to get the right college credits. (pst..honestly, like you're actually gonna learn how to speak with any language class). My teacher, I got along with her just fine. But you know, she wasn't the best. But, we watched this film and just to admit it to you, it wasn't the best. Over-dramatic and typically looks like it was read from a script. But it is, it does depict the reality of the harshness of coming fo the United States illegaly. And shows the common family struggles Mexicans and Mexican-Americans go through in these times. This, movie is like something I saw in a dream kind of. I'm from the Philippines, I've always wondered what Mexican culture is like. This like one of those movies, I'd see in a strange dream."
3,Other purchases have been better.,the case was damaged when we got it. the DVD froze a few times while it was playing.
3,"ok,,,the ending was bad..",I kind of liked the movie it was hard for it to be believable do like not really realistic but it was nice I hated the ending do definitely would have liked a better ending overall ok.
1,Kindle Users Beware!,"This book was not formatted for the Kindle. I have other chess tactics/puzzle books for the Kindle and they are formatted with the problem on one page and the answer on the next. ""Looking for Trouble"" has the answer on the same page as the problem! I'm considering returning the book. I could make it usable by having something ready with which to cover the screen when I hit <next page>, but even then there's no way to know exactly how far up or down the answer will be because the amount of introductory text varies from problem to problem. I'm a fan of Mr. Heisman. I enjoy his on-line columns and find them useful, but this book, formatted as it is, will be at best a pain to use and at worst useless. I may update this review in the future to indicate which tactics books ARE formatted correctly."
4,great but ok,the reason i bought this is for the duvall song on itand that is one of the few good songs. but it is a great song.but the others aren't so great. so it gets 4 stars.
5,Timbeless Classic,"For straight fine hair, these are the only way to acheive sustainable curls. Bonus, if setting gel is used the curl will last for most of the week... Major plus, no split ends from heat abuse."
5,Walk the Walk,I fell off the exercise wagon so long ago I am now beginner class again. Leslie's DVD was very doable for me but gave me a challenge as well. She is very encouraging and motivating. I love the background music.
4,Good for beginners,"The steps of the video are very easy to follow and would be appropriate for nearly any participant. I haven't done the one-mile workout, but the two-mile video (35 minutes) never goes beyond advanced beginner in difficulty or aerobic intensity. The background music is kept low. It's likely that you could do the program without realizes that it was praise music, although Leslie keeps up a fairly frequent patter of praise/encouragement. A weakness of the video is that she does not explain the stretches in the cool down section (at least not in the two-mile segment). Participants unfamiliar with these moves might not get much benefit from this section."
3,Not My Favorite Leslie Sansone Walking Video,"Let me start by saying I DO like Leslie's workouts in general. Her pacing and her encouraging approach both work well for me. This is my third workout DVD from her and it's my least favorite. This one has a faith-based theme including hymns to work out by and some remarks about praise and thanking God for our blessings. That is fine with me. What doesn't work so well is that I think the choice of hymns (Amazing Grace for one) really doesn't fit the workout. Plus the background music is very faint and barely audible over her almost constant chatter. It just seems like a good idea that wasn't executed well. That being said, I am still a big Leslie fan and will rotate this one through my routine."
5,Learning to Walk the Walk purchased at Amazon,This DVD I bought for a friend who has little time for exercise but really wants to get into shape. I own the DVD and really enjoy it when the weather outside is too hot or too cold. I always have this choice available and the 1 mile takes about 20 minutes from beginning to cool down. I alwyas sweat doing it so I feel that I am accomplishing something. The 2 mile is more intense for people like me but I enjoy it and the spiritual references Leslie ties in. I liked it enough to buy it for someone else - so I give it 5 stars.
5,Easy workout and great for beginners,"This workout video is great for beginners and offers several wonderful routines. Leslie's walk workout begins with stretches and some easy steps then introduces you to more flexible walk moves and concludes with a cool-down. This workout is excellent for cardio, calorie-burning and toning. She shares great information throughout the routine and remains positive to the viewer from the beginning to end of the session. She also offers intermediate and advanced walk routines in her series. I strongly recommend this workout to anyone who wants to begin exercising."
4,Another great workout,"This walking video is a great addition to my ""walking library"". Since I've started using the Leslie Sansone's walking videos, I don't mind exercising as much. She's a little chatty, but it's still a great and uplifting workout."
2,WARNING:Heavy on Christian Religion and Hymns,"Ok, in the past I have loved Leslie's workout tapes. My favorite is her old 2003 Super Challenge 4 mile Express tape. After a few years of not exercising, I purchased her ""Christian Inspired"" Walk the Walk 1 or 2 mile CD. I was surprised at how much religiousity is in this CD. The background music consists of Christian hymns and Leslie does a bit of sermonizing and God praising throughout the workout. If you are a devout Christian believer, this CD is for you. I still love her older, religion neutral workout sessions that are great for out of shape beginners and seniors like me."
1,Chasing Cars,$13.99 for THREE songs? I thought I was ordering the whole cd for that price. It should be more clearly marked as a SINGLE. That is a ridiculous amount to pay for THREE songs.
5,"Is not another all star...dvd, IT IS RINGO SOLO !!!!","This DVD is only Ringo Starr singing his own songs, the backing band are The Roundheads. The sound and picture are perfect. This is a must for every beatle fan.Why the song ""Never whithout you"" has been edited?. Five stars, don't miss it.The songs are:With A Little Help from My Friends/It Don t Come EasyOctopus GardenChoose LoveI Wanna Be Your ManWho Can It Be NowDon t Pass Me ByI m The GreatestGive Me Back The BeatMemphis in Your MindPhotographBack Off BoogalooBoysYellow SubmarineAct NaturallyWith A Little Help From My Friends"
4,VERY GOOD SHOW BUT BEWARE.......,"This was indeed a very good show, but as is always the case with PBS broadcasts they are never complete - and this is no exception. Just go to the PBS website to see what I mean. Why they do this is a mystery. Maybe it has to do with certain legal garbage. It still is worthwhile getting even if you'll never see the complete show."
4,Ringo is still a Starr,"Ringo continues to have a good time making and playing music. He is so much fun to watch. Being a drummer myself, and a consumate Beatles fan, I try not to miss anything Ringo does as soon as I can get my hands on it. He has quite a good bunch of musicians that he typically records and plays with, and even if you have heard many of his songs many times, they all still keep things fresh and fun."
5,SS review#1,"This book was great! I didn't read the 1st book in the series but i knew what had happened just by reading this book. I wasn't left in the dark. The author had a great way of making me feel like I was part of the story. In the end I was so involved, there were parts that i cried. This book was truley wonderful and I wish that I could go to Silver Beach."
1,Feeding the Green Monster offers nothing new...,"There have been plenty of cute, outsider-comes-to-baseball-heaven books about out of town visitors and their experiences at Fenway Park. Unfortunately, Feeding The Green Monster, differs from none of them in it's style, depth, perspective, or insight. It provides little more than a kid-at-a-candy-store hyped up feel-good movie of the week view of what is arguably one of the more interesting landmarks in sports. Also, Mr Neyer's fake humility regarding what he does and does not know about the park and the city is laughable, and no doubt embarrassing to many Boston sports fans. And nobody in Boston above the age of 5 calls the left field wall at Fenway the 'Green Monster'. Perhaps that is the target audience."
4,"Not his best, but a good read","This is probably Rob Neyer's least known book. His initial publisher rejected it and it was finally published by a rather obscure press months later than intended. Although the book describes a not particularly memorable season for the Red Sox, fans of Neyer will find it worthwhile. As much a memoir as a pure baseball book (the reason his first publisher rejected it?), it still includes large dollops of the distinctive Neyer analysis. If I knew Neyer only from his ESPN.com column, I would probably start with his Big Book of Baseball Blunders or Big Book of Baseball Lineups, both of which are likely to be more appealing to the hardcore baseball fan."
2,A disappointment,"Neyer's a good ESPN.com writer, but you wouldn't know it from this book. If you need a flannel fix, get Baseball Dynasties instead."
5,Finally Out In DVD,Glad to finally be able to get this wonderful old movie on DVD. It's nice when you can get a movie that you have been looking for for a long time.
4,Dragonball Z Duel Pack,My kids love this game and still plays with it. At first i didnt think they would like but since we are all dragonball z fans i said why not it even got me hook if your family is a dragonball z fan this is a game you got to try
4,A gift.,I got this for my twin cousins. I thought they would enjoy it because I used to love these books when i was younger. So far they love it.
1,It was used and written all over the book,It was so used that there was children's writing all over the book and almost on every page. Totally unacceptable to sell a book with children's writing on practically every page.
5,I Spy!Christmas! An ageless book for all.,"Years ago, when I Spy: A Book of Picture Riddles came out I purchased it for my daughter. I was thrilled when I Spy: Christmas came out later in the year. I have since purchased all the I Spy books and have passed them around to family and friends. The I Spy: Christmas book, like the others, is to be cherished. Not only is it a fun, and educational book, the images jump out at the adults and bring back wonderful memories of Christmas past. What I really like about this book and the other books in the I Spy series is that you can continue with the ""game"" after using the clues in the book. On a road trip one year I brought all the books along. Everyone in the car, regardless of age, played along. I love books, and at Christmas make it a point to provide friends and family with hardcover books to keep. This I Spy: Christmas book has always been a welcomed gift; a ""keeper"" by young and old."
5,I Spy Christmas,"My son loves the I Spy books, no matter what level they are. These are great books to keep their minds sharp."
5,great for all ages,kids and adults at my house enjoyed this book on Christmas Eve and Christmas day and days to follow
5,pretty pictures,It looks like you're in russia. i like the winter wonderland picture and the ornaments too. I also like the nature scene with snow.(5 year old's review)
4,Game Design Fundamentals,"This book will not teach you about game development. That is not its aim. The book aims to give the game designer a framework for analyzing the concepts of ""game"" and ""play"", hopefully giving the game designer a more analytical mind when designing games.For those who complain about the book not being helpful in creating computer games - you're missing the point. There are plenty of books on game development.This book is not an easy read. It's like going back to school and reading a book mainly focused on theory - you're going to get bored and find it useless unless that's exactly what you're looking for. It contains plenty of references to psychology, anthropology, and philosophy that you may never have encountered before in a game design environment.But for game designers who wish to have a more analytical mind on their craft, this is the best book available."
5,More than it seems,"According to a lot of the bad reviews, it sounds like you are trying to make this out to be a video game design book... but it's not, it's a book on game design in general, NOT JUST video games. Video games are a manifestation of the category of games. Readers of this text MUST be aware that this is not a narrow visioned book like most video game design books, it talks about a whole lot more. But because it does, it can't go into specifics on video games... which you can get in other books that disgruntled readers are mentioning. Overall, you must understand the focus and aim of this book to appreciate it. And intellectually stimulating? VERY! This book not only teaches you games but makes you rake your brain while at it, questions the fundamentals of most games you played as a child. Very intersting."
1,"Many words, little content","The authors treat you to a pretentious, hollow, lopsided ivory tower view of what games are and then summarize each section by having a guest writer design a game to be played with dimes.This is exactly what's giving acadamic game research a bad name.I can't imagine anyone who would find this gibberish useful."
3,I still don't know why this book was required for school,I read through it and pretty much has some common sense stuff about games. Things that are easy to figure out on your own. I haven't really used it for school but I guess a good read if you're looking to make your own games.
2,Too pleased with itself to be great,"Rules of Play has 150 pages of great material spread over 670 pages of text. The definition of meaningful play, the case studies and the troubleshooting tips are very useful. Unfortunately, the book tries to be both a design manual and a textbook. The result is a lot of material which any given reader doesn't need. Trimmed down and split into separate books, this work would get five stars."
4,"Flawed, but still worthwhile","While I feel there are some fundamental flaws in their premises, this is still an excellent book about designing games. The issues it brings up and the approaches to thinking about them in a systematic manner are important contributions to the field of game design. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in game design - even if you disagree with the authors the book gets you thinking."
1,A great door-stop!,"Failing at virtually every level to deliver useful information, this book is a whole lot of dead weight. If you are a student of games, you have many superior options.By the way, the spotlight reviewer ""Nikita"" is a close friend of the author, so now you know why he's so enthusiastic about it."
1,Does this book help you to create good/fun games?,"Simple No. Making games should be fun, playing games should be fun. Why this book makes telling how to create games so academic? When reading this i hope to do something else in every chapter I begin.IF you love games, if you want to create games.. Please skip this. Go to toy store, read totally different kind of books, draw, listen different kind of music, watch TV, walk outside. Think. You are much better path that using you time reading these kinds of theoretical mammoths."
1,Broke on first use,This is a GREAT idea. VERY poor execution. The first strap broke in the parking lot before we even got on the water. I tied a square not in it just to get through the day. The second strap broke when we hit 15 mph. I gave up at that point. The only part that held up was my knot. I use compression straps now and the work great.
2,Only Volum 1,"I love the video and have gotten a great workout thus far from volume 1. Buyer beware! The only negative comment I would say is that buyers need to be aware that there are two volumes to complete the two week training. It was not clear that I was purchasing volume one only. I had to purchase the entire workout dvd again to get both volume one and two together. Just make sure that if you purchase the DVD, that it includes more than the one week sample as I did."
3,Don't forget the equipment needed,"I couldn't wait to order this DVD and start right away. When I received it, no where on the DVD case did it say I was going to need a Swiss ball (which, thankfully, I had), dumb bells, a chair, a mat and a broomstick. Not a big deal but I had to pause the tape and run around and look for my stuff! I don't own dumb bells so I had to improvise last minute with two 64oz bottles of cranapple juice. After the work out, I do feel like I did when i had time to go to the gym - I'm exhausted and with twenty minutes ea wrk out, it's doable...I'm a busy mom with no time so I need this."
4,It really does work!,"I was skeptical that anything called the 12 second sequence would work; but I'm lazy; so I said I can do anything for 12 seconds! In spite of the title it is a full-body work-out and I've been doing it for about a month, and I've lost 5 lbs. and 1 and1/2 inches from my waist. I would recommend it to anyone who doesnt have alot of time but wants a challenging workout that has good results."
3,Is there more?,I thought the dvd has very good insturctions. The problem is it's for one week. Do you have to get a new dvd every week?
3,Slow and boring.,"I did this about 3 times. I understand the moves and the reasons for it, but the dvd is slow and boring. I am probably going to re-sell this at some point."
2,Same as the Power of 10 workout,"The 12 second sequence workout, is not a new idea. There is a book out by Adam Zickerman and Bill Schley that is called the Power of 10. This is the same concept as the 12 second sequence. They even recommend the 2 times a week workout and then you can go down to 1 time a week. Again, it is exactly the same elements. Slow, controlled movements. You do 10 seconds into the exercise and 10 seconds down. So if you are doing an arm curl, you slowly, controlled, move the arm up for 10 counts and then repeat down for a very slow, controlled 10. Again, this book was published in 2003, so sorry Jorge, this is not a new concept. Funny thing, too, they also recommend eating 6 times a day and not going over 4 hours between eating - sound familiar, as well?"
1,Looks Great - Don't buy it - Dangerous Design Flaw,This candle holder looks great.BUT whoever designed it paid no attention to the fact that there are some candles which are almost directly over other candles. The result: some of the candles melt immediately and the wax becomes liquid and overflows the glass holders AND the heat from the candles below could potentially cause the glass cup above to crack or shatter - sending hot liquid wax flying! Sadly this is a potentially dangerous product.
4,Better than Expected.,Range as previously stated is not near 8 miles - fuzzy at 1/2 mile but works ok for 3 to 4 miles - but for the price not bad. Work great on small trips and short distance - battery life so far is pretty good over 8 hours on one charge.
2,Not as advertised,"Cobra PR170-2VP MicroTalk GMRS/FRS 2-Way Radios, 8-MileGot mine in the mail about a week and a half after I ordered them. Good for close distance but I was lucky to get 8 blocks without them cutting out. Great for children in really small neighborhoods, but other than that, I would NOT recomend these for any other type of business/entertainment."
1,Battery life aweful,"These were rated for 8miles - and if you've ever done any research on these type of 2-way radios...regardless of the rating, if you're able to get a 1 mile range from them, you're a lucky few. I fully expected that disappointment. However, what I did not expect was that the rechargeable batteries that it came with were aweful. On a full charge, it barely lasted a trip to the mall on less than mild usage. Btw...there is no indicator to say if it is fully charged. I charged it for the recommended 10 hrs. Anyway...I had another pair of refurb Uniden that I got for almost nothing...that pair was just as good, if not better than this one which I paid $45 including shipping. Not a recommendation."
1,William Jenn WLJ,"There is no way these 2 way radios will carry 8 miles, I went less than a mile and could not hear the other person. As for a toy for the grandkids they work just get. They use them around the house. They work great. I went to order another set for the other grandkids and now they are unavailable."
1,cobra pr170,The items arrived on the date specified. But after charging them i found out that one of the units did not transmit or recieve. This was disappointing as we wanted to use them at Disney world instead of our phones. Was told I could exchange them but problem was that we were leaving in 4 days no way to get them back in time.
4,Brilliant Album!,"This CD is produced by cypress hill's legendary producer dj muggs, but it is not a hip-hop album. What muggs has created here is a down-tempo rock masterpiece. The vocals are mainly handled by amy trujillo and josh todd, but there are also apperances by greg dulli, who delivers the vocals on the excellant 'fat city' and muggs also collabs with his old pal everlast on the brilliant 'gone for good.' My other favourite track is 'rain.' But there are also many other great songs on the album. I seriously recommend this CD not only to cypress hill fans like myself, but to everyone who loves music, as this album has music from a variety of genres that will be enjoyed by everybody. Also, this CD shows that dj muggs is not only the best hip-hop producer around. But the best producer around. Period!"
4,Screw Haters,this album is fresh as hell. very unexpected. dont let the music snob below over analyze this one on ya. its a sleeper for sure.trust me. its more than worth the effort to at least listen to.
4,Progression,"Overall this CD should not be missed!It is a change from DJ Muggs' norm but it still packs his dark punch. Although it lacks heavily in the hip hop feel the source is still there. Its an expansion or a progression as all artist's should do with time and seems somewhat inevitable with age, being that Cypress hit about a decade ago. All the songs flow nicely together with a eiry complexity that reminds me of the European underground such as Massive Attack or Tricky hint hint. You be the judge but this CD is tight and works well just let it play."
4,Discovered Outstanding New Talent!,"Having always been a fan of DJJ's work, I bought this CD and was pleasantly surprised that it was more on the R&B vibe than the usual club material. It turned me on to some great new talents I have never heard of. It also includes such acts the splendid teenager Josephine Sincere, and Aka Soula who sounds like Curtis Mayfield. As a result, I bought Josephine's new CD and I love it! I also bought Dwele's based on this album. If you're into finding new discoveries who are better than the standard fare you hear on the radio daily, then this CD is for you. If you're looking for a ""house"" or ""club"" record, then it's not."
3,It Just Wasn't Hitten Me,"I felt this album could have been a lot more neo-soulful. Only three of the songs I have really enjoyed. The rest sounded ok. The beats should be droppin wit some hip-hop, r-n-bish feel with the right amount of jazz. I did not feel that in this album"
1,horrible!,"I'm giving it one star because I can't give it 0 starts. I hung this from the door and then I opened the door. Nothing. Then I slammed the door. Nothing. Then I took it off of the door and sat it on the counter. I walked away and it went off. Then it wouldn't stop ringing, even though it was sitting still."
1,save your money - buy something else,I was very disappointed in this product - cheaply made and didn't work well; instead of an alarm sound it made a weak buzzing noise (and this with fresh batteries). I gave it one star only because that was the lowest possible rating. I'd really give it zero stars.
5,We LOVE this toy!,Great for eye/hand coordination and lots of fun! I think it is listed for 3+ but we give it as a 1 yr birthday gift to all our friends.
4,Addicted to solar,"Good product,meets specs or exceeds,same as a northern tool 15 watt panel...so by whichever is cheaper...."
2,Does not measure up.,"I have had this unit for seven months, now. It honestly is just a cheap device, turned out cheaply, to cash in on the solar craze now going on. I'm all for great-quality solar panels that provide reliable energy. This unit does not. Yes, it reads fine on my multimeter, when I check it, but the battery on my RV is not staying charged. I have gone through two charge controllers, so I have to think that the panel just might be the culprit, here. I am in a city with almost 90% very sunny days. This panel gets full, blazing sun, just about daily, for seven hours. You get what you pay for, and you don't get much, apparently, at the price this unit goes for. My RV battery performs as it should when it is not hooked up to this unit. It charges and holds charge when I'm on the road. Again, it looks like a case of a badly made solar panel. Spend more for a better unit."
5,Aircraft use,I am using this on my Cessna to keep the battery up to snuff during the winter when I do not fly as much. The voltage output is over 16 volts. never got to 1 amp output but then again the battery was not needing it. I am using it with 60120 controller. the end holes work weil for holding the panel secure with some rayon cord.
3,OK so far- needs improvement in design,"I purchased two of these panels with the 7 Amp Charge Controller. There are many options in the package with clamps, 12V accessory plug, etc. I have these linked in parallel to the Charge Controller to keep my boat batteries topped off (2 x 270 Ah 8D AGM batteries). I have not had the system in place long enough to judge performance yet, but I will add that information later. Here are some suggestions for improving the design:Have a modular connection cable with a quick connect plug at both ends. Include a receptacle on the panel and a short cable to configure the panels in parallel with the long cable attaching to the controller. As it is, I had to wire both panels to a bus and then connect the controller- an extra expense and more things to install and configure. The mfg. should include a simple way to 'daisy chain' these together to use multiple panels to the same controller."
4,Solar battery charger,Used the charger in Canada to charge our boat after daily use and it provided the power needed for the next day. it had done all we had hoped for
4,these are good but i live in a bad place.,i have 2 5watt panels and 2 of these big 15watt panels and they are mounted on the outside of my house i live in fairbanks alaska so i get bearly any light now (like 2hours a day) and whats good about these panels though is they work pretty good out of the sun (and in -40) i cant wait until summer when i get to test them out in 24hr sunlight! i have it connected to a huge referbushed military battery its about 75lbs and 120amp hours or something like that but i can run my laptop off of it for a short amount of time. i was trying to get a bigger panel something around 50watts but amazon wont ship it to alaska. i would recommend this panel.
4,Nice packaging and it works,"There seems to be some chance of solar panels being damaged in shipping. I was pleased with the way this item arrived. The hard edged cardboard and foam kept the unit intact.I have not tested or used this under a load, but open circuit voltages ranged from 22VDC to 24VDC during partly sunny conditions. 22VDC was the lowest reading with the sun completely blocked by clouds. I'm waiting on the 7amp charger/controller to have some real fun. Will update soon.[...]"
5,Excellent,This is an excellent solar panel. I bought it as a replacement for one of mine that broke and it is much better than the old one!
4,Excellent retail solar panel,"For small installations such as storage sheds or small cabins, these panels can't be beat. The price is right and they perform well. On a bright sunny day I see about .8 amps per panel, though that will fluctuate with the resistance of the load (All solar panels have an optimal loading that will allow them to achieve maximum output). I use my panels to charge a Werker absorbed glass mat (AGM) lead acid battery that I then use to run an inverter whenever I need remote power. These panels do the trick, I'll buy more of them as my power needs increase"
1,Just Toys,"I bought 5 of these panels to charge a deep cycle marine battery for lighting a remote shed. I ran into problems about 3 days after installation because an 11 watt overnight light would discharge the battery and the panels couldn't handle the daily recharge. Only under ideal conditions, with sunshine most of the day, will this system come close to working properly. My suggestion if someone is trying to accomplish what I'm trying is to get on the internet and find a company that sells a good American or Japanese panel that produces around 80 watts. I tried this on a different location and it works fine, costs about the same, and takes up less room on the roof. I'm preparing my ""Toy"" panels for my next garage sale and hopfully some sucker will buy them."
5,Works great!,I went on a 10 day camping trip and never had to plug in the generator. This thing is great.
4,Good unit for the price,Great unit. It could use a better surface shield to protect it from easy cracking.
2,Very low power output for price and size.,"This should be called a battery maintainer and not a battery charger. We have a 90 Amp-hour battery on my boat and took this charger camping with us. It didn't come close to recharging the battery or keeping up with our daily power consumption. When we got home I kept it on the boat battery for 10 days and the battery still was not fully recharged.Doing some calculations, this solar charger takes about 5 days under above average weather conditions to provide enough power to run my trolling motor for about an hour. The 15W max output is not even enough to run my electric fillet knife.This charger is weak power and bulky in addition to expensive relative to power from the grid.Not recommended unless used as a battery maintainer, in which case I would get a smaller and less expensive unit."
3,Received broken twice,"Saw the reviews about receiving broken units but thought I'd chance it anyways since the price was so low. The first one arrived completely smashed. Amazon was very easy about returning it and getting a replacement. Second one arrived and looked good. Small plastic pieces were found on the ground where it was unpacked. I looked the panel over and didn't see any damage. Later, when I went to plug it into a 12V adapter I realized the Sunforce 12V connector was smashed. Overall, very poor packaging. If I were to do it again, I'd pay extra $$ and buy it from a brick & mortar location like Camping World. I have no idea how it works yet since I'm still trying to fix broken parts."
4,"Works well for boondocking RV, even with cracked frame","I installed one of these units, with the Sunforce charge controller, flat on the roof of our RV travel trailer (dual RV batteries). It is now 1 year old and has a couple of cracks in the plastic frame, but still seems to be working fine. Before installing it we could go 4 days before needing to charge the RV batteries in remote forest camping -- this panel adds 1 additional day. (By then we need to go to a commercial campground to do laundry, etc.; where I let the Intelli-power Charge Wizard charge from shore power.)Pros:* All automatic. Install it and forget it.* Silent (no stupit noisy generators)!Cons:* Could use more power!!!* Cracks in plastic frame?!?"
4,Solar Panel,"The product was shipped fast but got it and it had cracks across the face. A new one was shipped and a call tag issued for the broken one. Second unit was fine and I am using it on our travel trailer. It maintains the two batteries very well. The only problem is it is supposed to have an internal diode. It was draining the batteries at night. Installed a diode from Radio Shack for $1.59 for two. Installed it inline and works great. Would recommend this if you have some basic knowledge of electrical and solar, if not get a unit that has a controller with it.I would recommend Amazon as they were great with the first broken one. The second unit was on its way before the call tag was issued for broken panel."
1,Arrived Broken - Twice,I did not use the product due to it arriving with cracked glass - twice. I will try another product and would not recommend this one due to damaged goods. My guess is these are probably damaged before leaving Amazon since the boxes arrived in good shape.
4,Works slightly better than spec,"Got mine undamaged from northerntool for $92.40 (with shipping and tax). A quick DVM reading (laid out flat on ground in full sun at 2PM June 19th 2007 in Minnesota): 21 volts and 0.8 amps = 16.8 watts. Now $92.40 for 16.8 watts works out to $5.50/watt, which is a very competitive price these days (note that they only warranty up to 80% of rated output). I plan to use this to drive a 12V fountain pump. According to the specsheet, ""Yes, this panel is fully weatherproofed."" Nevertheless, I wish it came with a plastic hail guard, as the glass feels delicate. Looks like the same product as the Sunforce 50032."
4,Great Solar Panel,"I bought this one panel a month ago. It was a easy set up, some slicing and taping was required. I have it connected to my RV, which the batteries are marine ones. I just checked the volts coming off the panel in the sun and my meter said 22.4 volts. I had a problem keeping electric in my batteries, but so far this unit has kept me charged and ready to go. It has worked so well I am adding another panel this month. As of this date 9-1-11, everything is working fine. I did have to look up the website to see what I had to do to run more than one panel in a row. From the instructions, it says I can run up to 4 with this charge controller."
5,Happy customer,Sunforce 50032 15 Watt Solar Battery ChargerI was not dissapointed. Product came packaged very well. I have been using it for several weeks now and will buy a few more they work so well.
3,Pricey,"In reviewing all of the other lift gate supports, it appears the ones I need for my Chevy Equinox are one of the most expensive. ALL of the other makes range from $9-$17range. The set I ordered appears highly overpriced at $32.00. They did not even offer free shipping. I hope I am not dsappointed."
2,cookie dough?,These cookies are OK tasting but are such a dense and chewy consistancy they are kind of like eating cookie dough. Some may like that.....but not me. Will try something else next time.
5,Tasty and filling,"In terms of flavor, these kinds of products can be hit or miss. If found the Oatmeal Raisin cookies to be delicious and satisfying, especially with a cup of coffee in the morning. The cookies are large enough to hold you through to the noon meal. A good breakfast alternative."
2,Moist Cardboard,"I ordered both the banana nut + the oatmeal raisin and would return both if Amazon would let me. There is utterly no taste to these other than a foul aftertaste. Consistency of moist cardboard. For 290 calories, I'd rather have something with some sort of flavor."
4,"Good, quick ""on-the-run"" breakfast choice...","This is a tasty, filling and quick breakfast choice. It is a hearty choice that kept me from being hungry until lunch. Leave it partially in the package while eating it, though, because is can crumble."
4,Good stuff,"These do have a subtle taste to them, but they still taste fine (especially with some hot tea or coffee), and the healthy ingredients are ultimately a trade off I am comfortable with. With respect to serving size, one of these is a full breakfast - even when I am really hungry. If you are looking the overly sweet or powerful taste you get from those granola / breakfast candy bars you typically see covering all of the grocery store shelves - these are not for you. If you looking for a breakfast on the run that's healthy and filling - I would highly recommend them. I am on my second month of them with no regrets."
2,Worst in FF series.,"This cd really isn't even worth your money. With the exception of ""Cartoon Nightmares"" (which was recorded exclusively for FF3, and is a terrible song anyway) all of these songs have previously been released on compilation albums or other arists' albums. The purpose of the FF series is to let people hear scrapped and rare songs, but if they were previously released, it kind of defeats the purpose. If your a Psychopathic collector, than pick this up, but if you're just a casual fan, (if there is a such thing as a casual ICP fan) then just stay away from it."
2,no really good pictures,"I was heartily disappointed with this book because the cover gives the illusion that it is full of photographs. It does have pictures but they are mostly drawings or paintings. I wanted photographs of real people of the time. I paid too much money to be so disappointed. I would recommend by voluptuous panic instead, which is less expensive and has tons of interesting PHOTOGRAPHS."
3,This book had potential but I was not interested in it.,I repeat I am not a big fan of mystery novels but this one was not mysterious at all. Edgar Allen Poe left out the suspenseful feeling that every mystery should contain.
4,Install on a 3.4 2002 Grand Am,"Pulley assembly seems of good quality and only time will tell on how it holds up to daily use. This was a replacement on my wife's 2002 v6 grand am where the pulley was finally giving out after 100k. If you dont have a dedicated skinny tensioner removal tool i had to use a little trick since the pulley setup has a bit more depth. I used a 3/8ths socket wrench to release the tension and I had to install the new one with the wrench connected because i could only get it on and off the pulley when it was with the belt installed and not with tension released since the space to the firewall is too tight. Just a little tricky but totally doable, and that is the only reason I took off a star."
4,Care Bears on the wall,The stickers go on nicely and come off just as easily without worry to the paint or wall surface.
1,Pity your conversation partner,"The speakerphone squeals when it's on. I tried to make some obvious adjustments, but I hated to subject my friend to such torture, so I sent it back."
3,Cheap but functional,"The phone is a perfectly fine value for the price. Unfortunately, there is no option to turn the annoying ringer off - hence the 3-stars."
4,A page turner!,"In his debut novel Rick Buda has given us an engaging suspense story with a twist. You quickly become involved with the story and its main character Officer ""Mac"" MacKurghdy. After a bumpy start the story quickly grabs you and refuses to let you put the book down. Unlike some novels with a supernatural bent, this is quite believable.I plan to watch for Buda's next novel."
4,A many-sided thriller,"The first few pages set up the various elements and characters, leaving the reader a little puzzled as to the lack of continuity, then the pieces all start to come together into a very satisfactory, quick, page-turning read. The story is a combination of Indian legend, modern pollution problems and a good guy/bad guy thriller. A very good first novel and I look forward to this author's next book. A sequel to ""Wolfpointe"" would be welcome."
2,Did not finish.,"I tried, but I just could not get into this. I liked the main character, but the writing just felt too stilted and awkward, and I quit around 40 pages in. The book definitely could have benefited from some much tighter editing.Since 1 star equates ""hated it"" and I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it, I'm giving it two stars."
1,"Your kidding, right?","I picked this up due to its high ""word of mouth"" recommendation from a website I frequent. I eagerly started reading it and put it down after page 4. The repetitive, wordy prose circles around a detail creating a 7 sentence description where a 5 word one would do. The author knows police procedure from ""reading all about it"" instead of experience and it shows. I'm not sure about the plot, I'm too angry that I paid money for this to read it closely enough to know what it's actually about. The author found a small publisher, possibly a vanity publisher, to get this drivel on the market. Another bit of info, the author is touting the ""award"" for which he's been nominated. It's from a website where one pays $50 bucks per entry to have the work ""promoted"" as an award nominee/winner. I'm still nauseous. I'll be certain to avoid future works by this author."
5,"great sound, great features, built like a tank","For recording my voice (baritone), it does a great job. For extra warmth that means close-miking, which in turn means not popping your p's, etc. If you hold it close to your mouth but don't directly face it end-on, that's easily done (or get a pop filter). [...].The microphone electronics are extremely quiet - the audio is sampled at 18 bits.It comes with a warranty which is easily extended to 10 years for free.The real-time headphone monitoring is a great idea and works well.It's a bit heavy (part of being built like a tank), and you need to think a little about how you're going to mount it, since some cheap desktop stands can barely manage it.Some things to keep in mind are:1) It likes close-miking (at least for male voices)2) It is USB-only3) It is a on the bit large and heavy side.If those don't bother you, and the price is in your range, then you will probably like it a lot."
5,"LAND OF LOOK BEHIND, a must see","Growing up in a culture where the names Bob Marley and rastafaria typically represent only Popstardom and illegal ganja use, I went into viewing this movie expecting to see, once again, that portayal. I came out refreshed, with a different and more far-reaching understanding of the Rastafarian culture and the essence of Marley's music. To view LAND OF LOOK BEHIND is to peer into the depths of Look Behind's (Jamaica's) interior, to bypass the facades of tourism and pop, to see a people, their history, their prospects of a future. The message, wisdom and influence of Marley's music has never been so profoundly captured on film as it has in LAND OF LOOK BEHIND. It is a must for any Marley fan, as well as anyone at all interested in filmed documentaries. Indeed, it is a gem among stones."
3,LOOK AT ITEM NUMBER CAREFULLY!,Item is 5 starts***** HOWEVER *****This is model 4065801XGR which means NO EXTERNAL GPS UNIT with box.I purchased one thinking because of title it came with the GPS receiver! WRONG!!!!
1,NOT a Phenolic Varnish!,"I ordered this varnish specifically because the product description said it was a PHENOLIC varnish. When my shipment arrived, I discovered that they'd shipped me a urethane varnish instead, which I wasn't interested in. When I tried to return the item (because they did not send me what they advertised), I discovered that you can't return ""hazardous"" materials. I don't want a urethane varnish, I don't need a urethane varnish. DO NOT buy this if you are looking for a phenolic varnish. The company is advertising falsely."
3,Understanding the War,"This book has two sides two analyze I think. First is defining what the war is. Dickerson realizes that the war on both Middle Earth and our world is very cruel for both parts the winners and the losers. He tries to explain Tolkien's ideas about the war, cruelty, treason and courage. And the second side is very useful who dont like Peter Jackson's epic trilogy and thinks the adaptaion is bad. He criticizes the war mentality in the movies and tells the book has a big role to make indepth analyze about the wars. They are not a medium of killing hundreds of men or creature and becoming a hero he says for my opinion.If you like the books of Tolkien then read it, if you like the movies most, it is not your type then."
4,"Children ""Live Dolls"" Red Book Series","A magical story of Janie's living dolls and their daily activities, all in the atmosphere of polite society. The devoted fan will want to collect the entire series. Usually contain line drawings and illustrations by Virginia Keep, later reprints will have drawings in 4-color process. Out of print, now every book is considered collectible. There are many titles in the series.The Live Dolls' House Party, illustrated by Virginia Keep; Copyright 1906 September, The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Press of Braunworth & Co. [red cover with paste-on of Janie & doll].The Doll Queen sends a bus to Cloverdale to carry the girls and their dolls to the Doll Farm. There a miniature railroad station and train would take them to Dollsville, the home of the Doll Queen, for a House Party."
4,Book of Live Dolls,This is a great book It includs the story of live dolls More about live dolls and the secret of live dolls
1,Overpriced money-grab by distributor,"Selling just a few (relatively speaking) episodes at a time for the price this is being offered for is nothing more than a money-grabbing excercise.Avoid this until you can get the entire season in 1 box set.It's a great series. But that does not justify the costs associated with purchasing it in piecemail fashion. Given the amount of ""partial"" season releases one must purchase, it easily costs twice as much as waiting and buying the complete season."
1,Wow thats expensive!,"As much as I love this series, I can no longer justify the expense($44 at the time of posting)for 12 episodes. As far as buying it new...I am OUT. I will have to wait til the price drops down on the used copies after it has been out for a while."
5,Outstanding exposition,"I was introduced to this book by a talk that one of the authors (Arthur Benjamin) gave at the MAA Mathfest in Albuquerque in August of 2005. The talk was one of the very best mathematics talks that I've ever attended. Everyone in the audience could follow what was going on, and we all left with an understanding of the basic approach to combinatorial identities used in this book. The authors' approach is to prove combinatorial identities by defining a quantity and then obtaining different formulas for that quantity. One formula becomes the left hand side of an identity while another formula becomes the right hand side.When I read the book I found that it was just as clearly written, with lots of beautiful examples."
4,Lovely author,"I haven't read this book yet, but I have a signed copy after seeing Jenny Quinn speak at the 2005 meeting of the Northwest chapter of the Mathmatics Association of America. If her written work is anything like her speaking, then this should be a great book. Her combinatorial proofs are an interesting approach to old equations, and she presents them in a very clear manner. A most enthusiastic lady."
5,Big bang for the buck,"I just got this sub tube yesterday and installed it today. I noticed that there were no RCA inputs on the sub unit, but with less clutter just used the F.A.S.T. 9999 T connectors (6 six connections, L+, L-, R+, R-, Switched + power, Remote amp power). I haven't finished installing yet as it's a heatwave outside, so wires are not tucked away, not sure how long the wiring harness is but it seems to be sufficient to reach from my head unit to the cargo area in my small station wagon. Note ground wire is located near the subwoofer branching off the harness. I ran it for a few minutes and I am impressed how it fills out my lows, stock speakers in a Mercury Tracers are not all that and this is why I purchsed this unit. I am not inexperienced in subwoofers, for years before I was running 2x 12"" subs in a bandpass box, that setup would have been too much for me in this car. In a nutshell, this sub tube performs well, better than my expectations, installation was easy."
5,The name says it all...EZ,"This not to compared with aftermarket component subwoofer(if you do you will be disappointed). This just to add a little more thump to your factory audio system.Pro: EZ to install and EZ to remove(if you can follow simple directions you are set),completes most factory audio system (I don't know about Bose or other premium audio systems I don't have one) and easy to hide(not telling where).Con: A little bit expensive for 50watts of power(but whose complaining still give it 5 stars).I've had big powerful battery draining systems(2000 watts rms) but you can't just fit that anywhere (like under the kids) this system fits my current lifestyle and needs(family guy)."
5,Ok,Great sound for the car. You do not have to expect it to blow the neighbours ear. Just right to enjoy in your car.
2,Not really new in box,"Was previously used, missing wiring harness, and instructions. Fuseable link was already popped. Not as advertized.Speaker works, but needed additional parts from local source to complete the package."
5,Help,Do you need to buy the wiring kit for this to make it work or can you select the no instillation kit option?...
5,big sound,"I bought a 2011 Toyota FjCruiser stock and the stereo needed some upgrading. Well, all I can tell you about the sound is that at age 42 it sounds like my car when I was 17 and I was running a 12 inch punch and some huge amp in some store bought box. I have to tone ithe Bazooka down a bit because of its crisp deep base, and another good thing is that you can't really hear it vibrate or nothing once outside the car. Just what the doctor ordered."
1,JUNK for the $$,"Very dissapointed.The bass isn't very loud for an amplified unit.This thing is overpriced and is being overrated on the internet.I wish I would have installed it sooner before the warranty ran out, I would have sent it back.Yeah I listen to metal, but it sounds like it's only slightly filling in the bass parts through midrange speakers.Not much of a speaker system for the money.I can't believe this thing is amplified!Shop around and actually listen before purchasing!"
4,Great Sub for the Price,Good product for the price. I have a truck with extended cab and it provides plenty of bass for me and I like a lot of bass. Great product and I would highly recommend it.
5,"Great bang for the buck, great space-saver.","Great buy! I got the powered 100w 8"" tube with the FAST wiring adapter. Took me and my dad about an hour to put it in the trunk of my 2001 Accord sedan. Great loud bass, easy setup (I cannot stress enough how easy the installation process is when you buy the FAST adapter). Can crank it up high enough to really bump. I don't understand the negative reviews about how this isn't enough bass. This is plenty for anyone who actually likes to listen to music rather than attract police. Works best when the trunk is empty. Again, great buy for those who still want use of 90% of their trunk space after installing this. Plus, no amp to buy, and no additional setup involving the amp or your car battery :)"
3,Its good for a small system,"I bought this product over a month ago, At first I thought it was ok ... Well later on I found the stock power and ground wire SHOULD BE REPLACED!!!!, Since I did that I have better quality sound out of it... But now I'm wanting more power, (go figure) It is good for what it is... I'm currently building my system, when I ordered this tube ,I also ordered a alpine 4 ch amp... but now I can see I'm wanting to go with a seperate sub and amp..."
5,7 episodes in Series 2,"Love the series! The PBS broadcast of Series II actually contains 7 episodes total -- all 4 episodes from UK ""series 2"" and 3 episodes (out of 4) from UK ""series 3."" [...]Episodes of Inspector Lewis: Series II- And the Moonbeams Kiss the Sea- Music to Die For- Life Born of Fire- The Great and the Good- Allegory of Love- The Quality of Mercy- The Point of Vanishing"
5,Seven episodes in this set,"I received Inspector Lewis Series 2 today from PBS. There are seven episodes in this set including And the Moonbeams Kiss the Sea, Music to Die For, Life Born of Fire, The Great and the Good, Allegory of Love, The Quality of Mercy and the Point of Vanishing totaling almost 10 1/2 hours. Love this series."
5,Wonderful Inspector Lewis,"After longing for more Morse to watch, my husband and I starting viewing Inspector Lewis. This Series 2 seemed to become more intellectual, more Oxford, and very entertaining. We highly recommend this series for entertainment and being very British. Fortunately, Amazon.com sells this in the States as well."
4,Interesting,I am displeased by the change in appearence: I ordered the same product twice because it's cover has been altered.Mia Stybel
5,"Complex Plots, Great Characters","If you're looking for a literate mystery series with gorgeous scenery and architecture and engaging characters, Inspector Lewis and his cerebral sidekick James Hathaway may entertain you. I watch these while I'm on the treadmill and enjoy the complex plots and Oxford scenes. Last night I thought Lewis looks like the younger brother of Paul McCartney. James Hathaway has fun facial expressions--both seem like real people. The series gets better and better. It's a great escape and visual treat for Anglophiles."
5,Inspector Lewis series,"This series is a sort of spin-off from the Inspector Morse series. Lewis was Morse's sidekick. It is excellent and we have enjoyed it immensely. In some ways, it is even better than the Morse series, in that the Lewis-Hathaway team are closer and kinder than Morse was to Lewis!It is set in Oxford, and there are lovely shots of the city, the university and surrounding countryside.Definitely a must view!"
5,Very good,I made this rating because I believe that this book is very interesting.I will recommend this book to everyone.In very good condition
1,Poorly Constructed,"This tenderizer was a good idea--worked fairly well--but the welds on the bar that slides over the spikes snapped after only 8-10 uses. Glad I embeded it into my chopping block and not my hand. This thing is junk. Poor, poor craftsmanship."
4,Second one !!,We really like this tenderizer we purchased a second one for the boat. Now we have one at home and one to take with us.
1,Not worth it!,"Tried to use this once and was so unimpressed I promptly returned it. Although a great concept, this item is poorly designed and lousy quality. I'm surprised this item is marketed by Steve Raichlen, which is what motivated me to try it."
3,Not Quite as Extensive as One Would Wish,"This is more bibliography than bio, but it's still a decent book for the Howard completist, like myself. The biographical data doesn't cover much more than is found in the forward of most Howard books, but the real value here is the extensive bibliography. Pages and pages of sometimes obscure information is available.Not recommended for everyone; as I said, it is really only for only the true Howard completist."
2,"Don't expect too much since it is just a ""primer"".","The book does not have too much information on new SystemC 2.0 addition. It is also very primitive on the information given (well, it is a primer any way). The book is very easy to read but does not get anything in deep. You can get that level of information from a free user's guide. The content focuses on using systemC 1.0 to do simple synthesizable RTL design. Other than that, there is not too much you learn. A good introductory book on systemC but not very useful if you want to apply to your work."
5,Excellent introductory book on SystemC,I read this book cover-to-cover and it is excellent! It develops the material logically. The language is lucid and new concepts are clearly explained. The examples are very easy to understand and to the point.I would highly recommend this book to those involved in IC design as well as system design!
2,Not very fab.,"First off, the packaging is totally different from the image. It comes in a spray bottle, which is not the easiest thing to use when your slippery with oil. Second, and most important, it stings like hell. I used it as a massage oil after my bath, and it stung so horribly that I ended up pulling out a bottle of Bath and Body Works Creamy Coconut lotion. Totally not the way to start a romantic evening"
1,Very Bad treatment of the subject,"The author claims that this book is written for senior undergrads and gaduate students, on the contraray, of what he claimed, his treatment of the suject is very sketchy. He has written this book in a somewhat citational manner i.e not treating any details of the concerned topics whatsoever and only stating the facts directly like he is citing some kind of terminolgy and not intersted in giving the reader a thourough understanding of the subject.He has given extensive references and urls and so this book is more like "" I can't explain anything go search urself here"".I think its the most worst way anybody could adopt for writing a book. In my opinion the only purpose of this book was to have a publication on his credit.I would strongly recommend any students to refrain from buying this one as it will not help you much in any way.Or else if u realy like to use very expensive toilet paper then give this book a try."
3,OK but there are better BBQ gloves.,I do quite a bit of smoking meat and they do well with the heat issue but they are very slippery so handling greasy meat is not easy plus they stain. I throw them in the washing machine but some stains stay on them. I would not think you could use these on high heat grilling jobs but for real BBQ low and slow they work OK.I just purchased similar gloves from TexasBBQrub and they are black so won't show stains as bad and they are textured so not as slippery and they cost the same as these.
4,barbecue gloves,"I like the insulation. It really protects your hands, but if you have small hands it can be hard to grasp things with it."
4,Cool Hand Pork,"This is the only way to handle hot food, whether right off the grill or right out of the oven. In addition, they're easy to clean as well. No kitchen and/or BBQ pit should be without a pair."
2,Silly,"My son asked for these as a gift, otherwise I would not have wasted my money on something so silly."
3,Small,The gloves are just fine and well insulated for handling a smoked turkey off the grill. They run small in the size though.
2,Peeeeee-Uuuuuuuuuuu,"I have not used these BBQ gloves yet, so I can't speak about how functional they are...but goodness, they smell awful. They have a STRONG chemical smell, even after lathering them up with soap and washing them by hand a couple of times. I'm trying to air them out and am hoping the smell will dissipate. I plan on using them when I'm cooking whole chickens on my rotisserie."
1,No mention of these being made in China,"These gloves do work as thermal insulators, but I would never use anything made in China to handle food.Remember melamine? Thousands of dead pets from contaminated 'high quality' pet food, who knows how many dead Chinese babies from contaminated formula.Call me paranoid, but there is no way of knowing what 'additives' were dumped into the batch of silicone that these gloves were made from. I'd rather just use dish-towels and wash them later.I am absolutely sending these things back.Amazon, would you Puuuuuleeeeeeze label items made in China as such? I'll just keep sending them back. Also, I will never buy from one of your 'marketplace' vendors again as there is no recourse.Most things are made in China these days, but I refuse to use any product from there that comes in contact with our food or drink."
3,BBQ Gloves,This weekend was my first opportunity to use the gloves and they performed well. I smoked two pork butts and a beef brisket and my hands stayed comfortable inside the gloves while pulling the pork. The only drawback that I found was trying to pull the greasy gloves off of my hands.
2,Not enough length to be usable!,"I'm not returning these, simply because return shipping it too expensive. As soon as I put them on, I noticed they weren't long enough. They don't come up the arm far enough for you to grab a pork butt off the grill, hold it, and not burn up your arms. Quite a disappointment. If I were Steven, I wouldn't want my name on these."
2,Does not insulate well,The gloves do provide grip but do not insulate very well. Tried to use it to pull off a rib rack and even while cooking at a low 225 degrees I could only hold the rack for a couple of seconds before I had to put it down. Not what I would expect from a BBQ glove.
1,Garbage,They melted in my hand as soon as I tried to grab the skewers by the same brand off the grill.
5,The good stuff,"Got my pair of these gloves about a month ago and they are solid performers. I normally Q on a Big Green Egg at 250 degrees. These gloves enable me tp pull off a rack of ribs or chicken without burning myself at all. No discomfort from the heat and they surely grip anything as the rubber has a sever stickiness to them. They hace a cloth lining which helps keep the hands comfortable. Last week I pulled off a done brisket, took it into the house and seperated the steaming meat by sliding the glove between the fat layer and splitting the brisket. I tried that once bare handed and thought I was going to die! Yesterday I pulled off the hot rack, removed the ceramic plate setter from the egg, and added more mesquite wood to the burning coals. can't complain. Cleanup is easy, put on the gloves, squirt soap, hot water, and just simply clean them as you would normally wash your hands."
3,Slippery when wet,The gloves work as intended. My only complaint is if they get wet the grip is poor. Since they are designed as gloves that's probably not a great thing.
4,Very nice hot food gloves,I barbecue a lot and these are a must have for handling hot racks of ribs. They give you enough dexterity to slice up a roast and keep your hands from getting burned. Washing is just as easy.
4,"Good for hot food, bad for racks, Hard to clean","These worked great for handling hot meat. We also used them to adjust the hot racks in our smoker. This partially melted the gloves so maybe that wasn't a smart idea. Still useable, but a little rough and melty looking on the finger tips.Find it difficult to wash inside and out. Some reviewers washed as if you were washing your hands but I require more disinfecting than that. I would first wash while wearing them, then soak them, and even ran it through the dishwasher. The melty fingers definately made it more difficult to clean. Overall not that hard, just stating its not a wiz bang situation (and lord help you if you get the inside dirty)"
5,Easiest transfer of meat I've ever done,"Used the rubber gloves with a smoked turkey last Sunday, worked great. Easiest I've transferred meat out of the smoker ever. Not sure why it has taken me so long to get a pair. Can't wait to use them on a couple of pork butts."
3,good,"GOOD PRODUCT FOR HANDLING HOT FOOD. THE ONLY THING THAT MAY BE NEGATIVE, IS THAT THESE GLOVES HAVE A STRONG RUBBERY SMELL."
4,Good Gloves,These are great in that they allow you to handle your barbecue and shred it while it is still piping hot and easy to shred. No more burnt hands. The only improvement I would like to see is some kind of texture on the palms and palm side of the fingers. It would greatly improve grip as these get slick as a greased pig when shredding pork.
3,Barbeque Food Gloves,"The gloves are well insulated and fit me perfectly. I was able to handle hot rib racks, trays and meat quite well. The reason I rated them a three star is that when you get some meat grease or sauce on them, they really become quite slippery. You really have to be careful. Getting them off is a chore when there is grease, oil or sauce on them as they are smooth, slippery, and do not have any finger grips. You need someone else to pull them off or have a paper towel handy to pull them off with. Otherwise, they are pretty good and worth the money. They clean up easily."
3,Love to Cook,"These gloves do keep your hands from burning. The gloves were made for a huge hand, so beware. Of course my hands are not huge so it makes it difficult to use them."
4,Still feel heat through the gloves,"I purchased these insulated food gloves to help transfer my turkey for Thanksgiving. Having purchased the Granite Ware 0511-3 Covered Rectangular Roaster, I needed a way to get my turkey out without too much hassle. These gloves worked perfectly, and while I could still feel heat through the gloves, I was able to transfer my turkey to the cutting board with minimal fuss. These worked great while carving too, sparing my fingers from burns. I did not try this with my BBQ, but can envision using them to easily flip food items without fiddling around with the spatula and tongs. I would recommend this to a friend."
3,"It works, but careful of mildew","It worked well, it does protect your hands from heat and picks up meat for turning well. But then I had problems keeping the inside dry, and it started mildewing, since the is cotten. So I ended up only being able to use it for a while and then obtaining all silicon."
5,Gift for my son.,"Loves them! He can use them to remove the whole bird of the grill, pull apart pork, etc. I may have to invest in a pair!"
1,DO NOT BUY THESE GLOVES!,"I have used these gloves three times to remove hot chicken from a rotisseri. After only three uses, the gloves have holes and do not protect your hand from the heat. These gloves are not good for anything as far as I'm concerned. Now that I have had them for 40 days I cannot return them. Please don't let yourself be disappointed the way I was. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!"
3,They could be better,"Yes, they are perfect for handling hot food and pulling pork. The only flaw I've found is they are so hard to get off once you touch something greasy. Grease makes the surface as slick as ice and pulling the glove off from the fingertips is near impossible without a set of pliers.Had they installed skid pads in the fingers the glove would be easier to remove. I have large hands. Maybe that's the problem. I'm thinking to cut out the back side down to the wrist. Maybe that will help."
2,light heat resistant,"I was looking for a higher heat purpose glove. This one only goes to 245 degrees, but does not state this in the description part."
2,"definitely not the ""Best of Barbecue"" gloves","These gloves only get an OK from me. The gloves seem to be too small. I have above average-sized hands making it difficult to take the (one-size-fits-all)gloves off. Also the heat protection is mediocre at best. I smoke pork, chicken, and brisket. the heat should not penetrate immediately and yet it does. Smoking meats are usually between 230 and 285. The gloves are only rated 248 degrees. I would definitely pass on these gloves. Looking for new ones today because these are just not good enough"
4,"Use for Food Only, keep inside dry.","Although they are very heat resistant try to minimize usage for items other than food. I bought these for competitive barbecuing and they are great for handling hot items off the smoker but didn't hold up well to hot metal. I understand the title says food gloves, so just take this as a warning not to use for other extremely hot objects.Another thing to be mindful of is to try not to get the inside of them wet. The inside is some kind of fabric and since the gloves are not beatable, drying time is extremely long and the gloves are near impossible to turn completely inside out."
4,men who play with fire,can be expected to be burnt. I don't do the grilling/smoking so bought these in XL for the husband during the cyber deals. He uses them to shift food around while it's cooking. Only thing he doesn't like is they tend to get a bit slippery after handling meat.
2,Varinacwr,They do a good job picking up hot items of the grill but way to slick and slippery to even think of pulling pork of the smoker.
3,White == Dirty,"These get dirty and nasty looking pretty quickly. Which means if you have guests over and are touching meat with them, that could be a little awkward. I tried everything I could to clean them but apparently pork butt can stain them pretty good."
4,Pit gloves,Use the gloves to move and unload product from the smoker. Only thing I would change about them is the length. If the shaft was an inch or two longer they would be perfect!!!
4,Gloves,these gloves are a little stiff but work great for insulating your hands. I have only used them a couple of times and i can't even feel any heat. hopefully they loosen up as I use them.
3,These gloves will melt!,"I got these gloves to use for grabbing meat out of my smoker. Given that they are BBQ gloves I figured they would be somewhat heat resistent but after using them a few times I noticed that they do indeed melt if you touch hot surfaces with them! The material is kind of this rubbery slick material so be careful if you're grabbing a pork shoulder off your grill or smoker because these will melt if you touch the grates. I'm not sure if it's possible to create gloves like these that won't melt but it would be nice if someone did! For what it's worth, I still have these gloves, they just have some char marks on the finger tips which I can live with. I just have to be careful when I'm taking any meats off the smoker from now on..."
2,After 14 months disapointed with rock-stiff gloves,I use these with my Cookshack electric smoker; thus temps are always constant and under 230 degrees. I will agree with most other reviewers regarding caution about touching/moving hot racks in your smoker will cause the gloves to melt. The cautions about slippery grips is also totally true. My use for the gloves is moving pork butts and briskets around; I also use them to pull pork shoulders in a pan.After 14 months of use the big disappointment I have with these gloves is that they have dramatically stiffened over time. The fingers are now to the point where it is hard to bend them and the gloves are almost impossible to put on and off.I need to buy another pair of gloves; I won't buy these again. This was my first pair of smoking gloves; I'm not sure if they all have these challenges or not.
3,Hastily Compiled,"Is more like a collection of articles on various topics on Suge ( i.e, his incarceration , relationship with 2pac , etc... ) hastily compiled into a book. rather than a 'flowing' autobiography. As well, it's pretty annoying when the author repeats a lot of stuff every few pages. Also , there is too little solid info of the guy ( e.g. too few interviews from people in Death Row or those connected with him. ) Hence, can't really get a solid picture of what the man is really like. Overall, is more like an academic ' analysis ' of Suge Knight based on few, random bits and pieces of information, rather than a solid ' story ' of the guy."
1,I HAVE NOT RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT,"IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR RECORDS, I HAVE SPENT WELL OVER SEVERAL THOUSAND WITH YOUR COMPANY IN THE PAST YEAR, I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THIS BOOK AND I WOULD LIKE AN ANSWER IMMEDIATELY. TRULY YOURS,BRIAN D. WHITE"
5,Glued to my tv set....,"I have never really been into period pieces, they just didn't interest me. I DVR Masterpiece Theatre mainly to be able to watch the Prime Suspect series. I had Jane Eyre on my DVR for about a month after the series finished and decided to give it a try. Within the first ten minutes I was just amazed. I have never read a Charlotte Bronte novel. Never seen any of her books made into movies. This just blew me away. Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens were amazing. The younger actress who played Jane as a child really had me feeling every bit of torment she went through. No spoilers here for any who haven't seen it, but this is definitely one DVD I plan to own and watch over and over again. Thumbs up to BBC and PBS for this amazing film."
5,Nicely Done!,"This is a beautiful adaptation of a classic. The Clarke/Dalton version still holds pride of place in my opinion, but for those who are not Eyre purists, this one will definitely not disappoint (unlike the more recent ""Hollywood"" versions.) The cinematography is fantastic and the casting superb. This would be the version I would recommend to a non-Eyre-ophile due to the overall quality of the production. It really was nicely done!"
4,Very Good!!,"I was hesitant to watch this version of Jane Eyre since the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton was, in my opinion, the best ever (this being the only reason I couldn't give this edition 5 stars :D). But, my friend and I finally sat down last night and watched it. Except for a few differences, it was absolutely wonderful! The photography was breathtaking and the acting superb! We sat in silence as we watched the credits roll. This is a movie that is definitely worthy of one's money and time!"
5,THE ONLY VERSION OF JANE EYRE THAT I LIKE!,"One night, I was fortunate enough to have stumbled upon a re-airing of this Jane Eyre version. The first few minutes already captured my attention. But it was after the first encounter between Jane and Mr. Rochester that made me realize that there's something different about this version.I haven't read the book, but I was always curious about JANE EYRE. I tried watching other versions, but they all bored me. I was never drawn to the characters until this version came along. Ruth's Jane and Toby's Mr. Rochester had chemistry!Some criticized this version for not being entirely true to the novel. May I say to those individuals that not only did I purchase this DVD after watching the movie on PBS, I also bought the book."
5,Beautiful !,"Though ashamedly I have not read the book, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was just beautiful ! :) What woman wouldn't want a Mr. Rochester of her own. *sigh* <3 For anyone who enjoys period dramas, this is a must see!I like to watch movies with subtitles on, especially if it's an English movie in case I can't understand a word or two because of pronunciation... and this DVD, like BBC's Pride and Prejudice, does not have subtitles, grrr. Wish they'd fix that."
5,Bravo!,"Truly a great movie that you can enjoy over and over again. Acting is beautiful, scenery is just what it sounds like in the book. The only thing I would have like to see is the ending with a little more aniticipation. The sequence of finally finding Mr. Rochester and bringing him a glass of water should have been done with as much tension and anticipation as the rest of the movie. I think had it been 1-2 more segments long like Pride and Prejudice, it would have made all the difference. However, overall I adored this movie."
4,Dismissed important parts,"Intriguingly inviting story and superbly acted. Georgie Henley played a most convincing role of young Jane Eyre. As well as Ruth Wilson and other main characters. Although the only disturbance I had with this film was that it dismissed Jane's turn of heart towards God when she falls in love with Edward Rochester. Jane begins to let her emotions for Edward become a priority instead of God. The book clearly states that and it signifies a foreshadow to what kind of man Jane really falls in love with. If they had put that in and showed Jane's faithfulness to God in the beginning you'd understand why she said the LORD's prayer in the middle of the film. Also, they didn't accentuate Edward's repentence enough. He's so screwed up and such a sinner that when he repents and asks for God's forgiveness you feel a sense of happiness for him, but they summed it up in a few words. Not really moving, if you ask me. Other than that, I think it very well played and written."
5,Jane Eyre,"I love this adaptation. Ruth Wilson is a great choice for Jane, and Toby Stephens is a very dark and sexy Rochester. Perfect! There are a few changes from the book here and there that will probably annoy the hardcore Jane Eyre fans, but for the rest of us it's pretty great."
5,Passionate Adaptation,This is by far the best adaptation of the book and has not been afraid to focus the story totally on the two lovers. I'm sure traditionalists will be unhappy with that but I'm as pleased as punch.Its given Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson the opportunity of a lifetime to bring to life a Rochester and Jane we really care about. I'm at the end of my seat waiting for tomorrow's final instrument and I'm not alone.Its definitely a case of move over Colin Firth and hello Toby Stephens. He's made me fall in love with the character of Rochester and I have to admit I've rather fallen for the delectable Toby too. I particularly like the humor he's brought to the role and vulnerability. He certainly looks good in a pair of breeches and boots. His on screen chemistry with Ruth has been a delight to watch. I wish I could watch them together for many more weeks.The series and 2 leads deserve a BAFTA and international Emmy.
5,Jane Eyre,"Ruth Wilson has given an excellent rendition of Jane, the acting is superb.However, I do feel she is too pretty for the part.Having said that, I feel this is best version of the many produced so far. I personally have 3 in my library. I doubt any future production of Jane Eyre if any, can surpass this version.This is a 'must' to have."
5,A must-see for the Jane Eyre enthusiast,"Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson are my favorite Rochester/Jane pairing ever. The chemistry between she and Rochester was amazing. While some liberties were taken with the story and dialogue, I can't say enough good about this version.Some reviews complain that Toby Stephens wasn't an ""ugly"" enough Rochester, but I think he was absolutely perfect for the part. Stephens brought a level of sex appeal to Rochester that Timothy Dalton couldn't equal.Ruth Wilson is my favorite Jane casting so far - she brought warmth, quiet intelligence, and humor to the role.The ending was too Hollywood and sappy, but otherwise, this version is well worth your time."
4,Excellent adaptation,"This is probably the best Jane Eyre version I've seen. The version with William Hurt seemed dull and lifeless and the version with Timothy Dalton was way too melodramatic. This one seems to be the best quality, both with regards to acting and cinematography. Ruth Wilson is a perfect Jane and Toby Stephens plays an excellent Rochester, though perhaps a little too handsome to be exact. Stays faithful to the book, I believe, though it has been some years since I read it last. Excellent adaptation!"
5,A different approach....,"After watching this latest version of my favorite classic, I have to say that this is the most sensuous telling of the story. I loved the intense and very passionate relationship between Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson.I was so drawn into many of their scenes together, especially when Jane rescues Mr. Rochester from the firey bed. I was mesmerized at the sight of him laying on the bed, his shirt unbuttoned, especially as past tellings of the story have always had Mr. Rochester in his high-buttoned Victorian era style bed clothes. When Toby Stephens pulls Ruth Wilson to him, explaining that she had saved his life; the silence between them cuts through the room.As I described this version to someone, this is a contemporary version of a nineteenth century story. It doesn't follow the book exactly, but it is an intense, compelling telling."
5,Wonderful,"I have watched so many versions of Jane Eyre and this one blew me away. I enjoyed it so much! It passes quickly through Jane's childhood and her experiences at school and instead focuses on her relationship with Mr. Rochester. I loved watching their playful banter and their flirting with each other, it was just so beautifully done. No, it isn't completely true to the book as the Timothy Dalton version, but that in no way detracts from the plot, it is so wonderful to watch. The film drew me in, I laughed, smiled and cried right along with it. This is my favorite version by far and I can't wait to watch it again:)"
2,Tailor made for the Women's Entertainment Network,"The brooding landscape is the real star of this new adaptation of Jane Eyre. Both lead actors are too conventionally pretty to be convincing, rendering their comments about plainness/ugliness patently absurd. Wilson has some good moments as the stolid, composed Jane in the face of endless hardship; and Stephens makes a persuasive case in the declaration of love scene. But the updated dialogue, Jane's teasing retorts to Rochester, and especially the makeout scene -- on a bed, no less, and between a religiously devout pre-Victorian virgin and the man who just betrayed her -- ring completely false. The hinted-at sexual aspects of the novel are overplayed here. To top it off, Bertha, the lunatic wife, who in the book was feral and unkempt, here appears beautifully groomed and MTV ready. How far Masterpiece Theatre has fallen!"
5,Toby rocks!,I wasn't so keen on watching yet another Masterpiece Theatre adaptation. Am I ever glad though that I did! Some of the scenes were so mortifying. I really felt for Jane. Only drawback were her duck lips. They got quite annoying by the third hour. Good casting and good acting all around - what else is there to ask for?
4,enjoyable retelling,"I enjoyed this version of Jane Eyre. I have a crush on Toby Stevens after seeing it. However, the intense passion between Jane and Rochester seems a bit implausible sometimes -because she is so plain. I know that in the novel she is supposed to be plain, but so is Rochester. I think the director chose an actor who is almost too good looking for this role. His rugged, handsome face is distracting compared to Jane's sad, plain face. I don't want to be harsh, but I find the attraction between them a little hard to believe."
2,Was a disappointment.,"Just my personal opinion. In the story of Jane Eyre, one my favorite scenes is the ""burning bed."" This movie just ruined it. I was so excited when it was time for this scene in the movie, then I just wanted to scream. Mr. Rochester's snippy but funny remarks during this scene were completely left out. (""Is there a flood?"" ""Is there a plot to drown me?"" ) I can't even imagine that changing this scene was approved.I gave it two stars because I did like the look of the actors."
5,Jane Eyre 2006 Version!,This is my favorite version of Jane Eyre! Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson absolutely captured the deep abiding love of Jane and Edward(Mr.Rochester):) I would recommend this DVD to all who love Romance!!!
5,Love it!,I saw this once on Masterpiece Theatre and have been looking for it ever since. I watch it all the time.
2,STICKING TO THE OLD VERSION,"IT SEEMS FROM THE REVIEWS THAT I'M IN THE MINORITY OF ""NOT LIKING THIS VERSION OF JANE EYRE."" FIRST OF ALL, SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS ARE LEFT OUT, SECOND, LINES WERE ADDED THAT WEREN'T EVEN IN THE BOOK, THIRD OF ALL, TOBY STEPHENS WHO PORTRAYS MR.ROCHESTER ISN'T DARK AND ANGSTENOUGH TO PLAY THAT CHARACTER. I KNOW THE EIGHTIES VERSION OF JANE EYRE WAS CONSIDERED LOW-BUDGET, BUT IT WAS MORE TRUE TO THE BOOK. I WATCHED THE EIGHTIES VERSION BEFORE I READ THE BOOK. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I READ THE CLASSIC, AND ALL THRU THE BOOK I COULD INVISION TIMOTHY DALTON AS MR. ROCHESTER AND ZELAH CLARKE AS JANE, AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW THE MOVIE STUCK TRUE TO THE BOOK... AFTER READING IT I THOUGHT I WOULD ORDER A NEW VERSION OF THE BOOK AND I COULDN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT, WELL NOW I WISH I HADN'T WASTED MY $18.00."
4,A great story well told,Well I'm sorry some reviewers felt the leads were too attractive. That didn't occur to me. It was a very moving and dramatic interpetation of this compelling and offbeat story with perfect period details and high drama. We enjoyed it thoroughly and look forward to the DVD.
2,Wait!,"According to many sources on the internet the US DVD does not have the Special Features that the UK version has. For some reason they are distributing the DVD with all of the Special Features later in May. The US DVD reportedly only has cast filmographies and a biography of Charlotte Bronte. The UK version includes all of those above and deleted scenes, audio commentaries, interviews with cast & crew, and a photo gallery.If all the extras aren't important to you by all means go ahead and order this beautifully done adaption of Jane Eyre. Of course these sources could be untrue but I'd rather wait to find out then to go and buy another copy of it in May."
5,Loved it,"I'm not one for writing long reviews, but if you're given to an appreciation of 19th century authors, period films, and Toby Stephens...this is a ""must see.""It's excellent."
5,"Jane Eyre (Masterpiece Theatre, 2006)","When I saw Jane Eyre on Masterpiece Theatre, I knew I wanted the continued enjoyment of viewing this again and again. I am so glad I ordered this item.Presently I am reading the companion book - the writing is so well done."
5,just shows you what real talent can do when givin a chance,"fantastic, tasteful,brilliant. you can feel the passion and talent of real creative people at work .the actors, directing ,locations not to mention a classic story that deserved to be told with repect and dignity theses people brought it to life with and there wasn't any of the hollywood b.s.to ruin it.thats very refreshing for a change. luv it"
4,I enjoyed it,"I've always been of fan of the Jane Eyre film starring William Hurt, so I didn't think I would like this as much. I was pleasantly surprised. I thought this film was well done. I liked the way that the relationship that developes between Jane and Mr. Rochester was portrayed. Although there were parts of this story that I compared to the William Hurt version and preferred that one, i.e. I thought that Anna Paquin did a better job playing Jane as a child, I thought the older Jane and Mr Rochester's characters were very believable."
3,Well done........for the most part,"I thought it very wonderful that Masterpiece did a production following the story line so closely ie. Jane Eyre's teaching and her cousins love interest.But,I was so dissapointed at the addition of very sensual love scenes as well as a weegee board ""game"" at Thornfield.That was way out of line from the authors intent.She was a clergymans daughter.I would warn any conservatives from watching this.Guess I should have read the write up more closely,thought they were just bluffing.=)Great acting,I like Ruth's freshness,she seemed to really be Jane."
5,Bronte fans must see!,"I love this video. It is so masterfully composed, and manages to tie the story together while building the complex characters true to form. I could not imagine that they could produce a better casted, better directed film. Bravo!"
5,my new favorite movie,"Jane Eyre has been my favorite book since I was 12, but the movie renditons never seemed to do it justice. So when I watched this version originally broadcast on pbs through Masterpiece Theatre I was delighted. The chemistry between the 2 main characters jumps off the screen. The color and vibrance in this DVD edition is beautiful. I highly recommend it. A must for fans of Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and the like. You will not be sorry you purchased this Dvd."
3,Not up to Masterpiece standards,"This 2006 production of Jane Eyre pales in comparison to the 1983 production. While I like how this film handled Jane's early years, the characterization of both Jane and Mr. Rochester is way off. Most unfortunate, in my opinion, is the degree to which the dialogue has been altered from the novel whereas other productions have been far more faithful. I try not to quibble too much about such alterations, but in this case the alterations were not at all for the better and often lost what had been the primary point of the conversation. Jane was robbed of some of her wittiest reparte, and Wilson overplayed her part to such a degree that Mr. Rochester's powers of observation lost much of their impact as well."
3,"2 stars part 2, 4 stars part 1","Part one of this production is a pleasure. It is a faithful and sparkling adaptation. Unfortunately, you will regret having watched the first part after viewing part two. It is a disappointment. The pace is off. The changes they make to Bronte's story do nothing to add to the drama or to move the story forward. They simply flatten the original. To be sure, the changes appear small. However, suspense and dramatic tension are created through small, significant , sharply focused moments. Part two loses these in favor of bland romantic notions. One by one, my household of boys joined me in watching part one. They loved it. They were hooked on Jane Eyre. Part two left us all wondering what happened."
3,Disappointing,"The casting in this production simply isn't true to the characters; both Jane and Rochester are far too good-looking, while St. John isn't good-looking enough. Rochester isn't as stormy and haunted as he should be, and his mad wife it too attractive to provide the stunning visual contrast between herself and Jane described in the book. Blanche, who was ""dark as a Spaniard"" in the book, is a cherubic blonde here, and not nearly as malelovent as described. The story has been tweaked in numerous places; for example, St. John didn't find Jane languishing in the moors, but huddled on the doorstep of the Rivers' house. Because this tale can certainly stand on its own--indeed, it has for nearly 200 years--I wonder at the motivation of those who would change it. I wouldn't watch this a second time. It was entertaining up to a point, but as a huge fan of the book, I was ultimately disappointed. I think it was sadly miscast."
3,Two stunning performances and a script that forgets its source ...,"It was a delight to watch Ruth Wilson as a nearly perfect Jane and the magnetic Toby Stephens -- superb as a moody, troubled Rochester -- and the magical screen chemistry between the two. But the story, which was riveting for almost two hours, slowly morphed into a soap opera. The reviewer who said this movie was made with young female DVD buyers in mind is exactly right."
2,Jane Eyre was always a favorite book of mine...,"so I've always happily watched any movie and/or television adaption--until now. This take on the classic was dull. lifeless and flat. Something I never thought I would ever see. The book was really not just about a timeless romance but ahead of it's time in describing a woman's self-growth. Here, Jane is anything but the ""heroine"" I'd come to know in the book. She was lacking in the fire and emotional strength that you got from the book. A most disappointing adaption."
2,"Yet ANOTHER Jane Eyre adaptation *sigh* --- what about ""Villette""?!?!","My love of the novel and the 1983 BBC film adaptation starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke, ruined all chances of me enjoying this latest Masterpiece Theatre version of Jane Eyre. It started off well with the gloomy mystery I was expecting, and then it became an overly melodramatic succession of one sappy scene after another. Ruth Wilson pulled off the character of Jane fairly well, but Toby Stephens I felt was miscast - too much smiling and smirking - he played Rochester like a caricature and ended up seeming comical instead of smolderingly sexy. The multitude of kissing scenes didn't help to turn up the heat at all. This version is definitely for the younger perkier crowd of romantics. For me, it lacks depth and I don't feel the weight of the story - I'm not left wanting more."
2,too short & low budget,This adaptation has 2 problems; it is too short. The first part with Jane's childhood and her aunt can have a whole chapter. The second at Lowood school needs another whole chapter. Important literary characthers like Mr. Brocklehurst & Miss.Temple are barely seen or left out.This novel has a lot of psicological evolution with Jane and Mr.Rochester that simply needs more screen time.Second problem is a modest or low budget;cinematography is too dark and poor. Few fill and background light is used so characthers are not separated from the background.
2,avoid,If you have any respect for Bronte's story or interest in television production values avoid spending money on this.
1,Leading Lady,The leading lady in this movie makes the entire production almost unbearable to watch. Her voice is absolutely monotone and whiny. Her attempt to play a character whose superiority and self righteousness lies just under the radar is transparent and obnoxious.
1,Duck lips were sooooooo distracting,"I am a big fan of the book and love all things British. I especially wanted to see this re-make because I adore Toby Stephens.But during the whole movie I was massively distracted by the actress who played Jane Eyre.I hope her lips are natural and that she did not purposefully inject her lips with something.But regardless, they were extremely annoying.It took away from everything and after stumbling through the movie I gave the DVD away.Duck lips needed to go. I'm amazed the director and producers didn't notice it before they filmed. Even the DVD cover shows the duck lips in all their glory.Horrible."
5,Gorgeous rendition of Jane Eyre,If you like this story you'll love this rendition. It's beaufitully done and the acting is so well done. One of my favorite movies!
5,Best of the Jane Eyre adaptations!,"I rarely give reviews, but this is the best of all the Jane Eyre film adaptations that have been made thus far. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and this one is the most accurate and attentive to detail. The 2011 version is beautiful, the music, the aesthetics, but their relationship is hardly developed and feels rushed and lacking in depth. I absolutely love this film!"
5,No extras with American dvd,"I know the question has been raised about whether there are extras with the American dvd. Unfortunately, there are no extras. I just received my Jane Eyre and it is two dvds with Part 1 on the first dvd and Part 2 on the second. No extras. Apparently, the British dvd version has extras. I am disappointed because I was looking forward to deleted scenes and, hopefully, a behind-the-scenes look at making this miniseries. This is a wonderful version of Jane Eyre though, so it is still worth buying."
3,Undecided.,"This version was rather good, but if you wish to get an actual feel for the original novel--You're completely out of luck. Both Jane and Mr.Rochester's parts were acted well, and the chemistry between the two actors really made the movie, but it just wasn't the real Jane Eyre. This version diverged from the book on almost every point, even the simplest of details was reworked and rewritten. They more or less modernized it...just without changing the time period. Language was simplified (a heinous crime in my estimation for Charlotte Bronte's ease and fluidity of writing is of the utmost importance in the original--her writing was what really made the story spectacular as well as timeless), and both Jane and Mr.Rochester acted a bit more free-spirited...but in a way that just didn't suit their original characters. So all in all, great movie if you've read the book, but not to be taken as a direct interpretation."
1,Inferior version of a great collection,"Look for the original issue of this collection instead! this one has different artwork and drops two tracks - Allelujah by Lisa Lynne, and Amazing Grace by John Doan - that appeared on the original. Another sad example of how the post-Will Ackerman Windham Hill label has gone downhill."
5,Love Love Love it!,"We play this once a week when we are eating diner or just relaxing. Not too seasonal, but very calming and nice background music."
3,Thanksgiving Windham Hill,"A mixture of some great stuff and not so great material. The disc looked to be in immaculate condition however it came to a point where it skips and the music breaks down Tried on several CD players with the same result.To much hassle to return it and no fault of the seller as the CD looked perfect. Fast ship, good seller."
5,Great Music,Windham Hill has long been a favorite label of mine and this compilation did not disappoint! They have a long history of great music performed by very talented artists. I certainly would recommend this one.
5,Well worth listening,This is great album to listen to weither for a quiet afternoon at home or for a gathering with family or friends.
5,LOTION,"THE SOMBRA MASSAGE LOTION IS EXACTLY THAT VERY SOOTHING AND CREAMY! GREAT FOOT MASSAGE LOTION,YOU DONT HAVE TO USE ALOT!!! THANK YOU"
2,Like it BUT,the tube split up the side and each time I try to use it it gets all over the place...so I have not used it and threw it in the bathroom closet. I would like to try the product again but a little gun shy as I do not want the same thing happen again....
1,Tea box,"Liked the idea of the box but the tea tasted/smelled like glue or paint or both. Once I removed the tea from the box, it was OK."
1,Tea no taste,I found the tea to be bland. Thank goodness the box can be reused for other teas in the future otherwise it would be quite expensive for the quality of tea in the box.
2,Tea chest,"I received this tea chest as a gift and am just now getting around to trying the teas. The chest is beatiful and will be great for future use; however, I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the tea. Although the bags are highly aromatic, the tea is very bland, as if the bags were old. I am sure Bentley teas are usually fresh and tasty, just not the box I received."
1,Cheap Box,What a disapointment. I should have taken heed to the negative review saying it was a cheaply covered veneer box. It does NOT look like wood. There is a horrible smell when I opened the box. Unfortunatly being a food product it is not eligible for return.I would not recommend this item for a gift or for a nice display of tea. I'm hoping that the tea is worth the cost of the entire item. . .
3,"Ok Product, Very Plain Teas","I should have listen to other people before I bought this item.If you are looking for something cheap, this item maybe good enough but if you are a serious tea drinker, this item isn't for you."
1,Very Poor quality,"I'm very disappointed in the quality of the box, so much so that I haven't even tasted the tea. The product description says it is ""wooden with full velvet lining"", when in truth it is cheap pressed cardboard with wood grain contact paper (or something similar). Very flimsy (cheap) hinges and clasp. I considered giving it to someone as a gift but I would be embarrassed doing so. Don't waste our money, especially since Amazon won't let you return it."
3,nice chest & teas,"I really like this chest. I think it makes an elegant presentation and has a good chance of being useful and attractive after the tea is gone. However, one of the corners on the box was very badly dented. Since this is a gift, it is a bit of a problem. I hope the seller can rectify this, as I would like to purchase more as gifts, but I can't have the boxes arrive dented to my gift recipients."
5,The Lectures... pt1?,"If hip-hop seems to bother you nowadays because it lacks lyrical content, then you need to consider this as a definite alternative. Unlike the usual P.E. or mistachuck style, this venture though unleashes the sounds borderlining metal, but staying strickly funk. It seems to suit Chucks powerful voice though, and really gives him a platform to unleash some views...and wisdom about Race, Rap, Reality & Technology. This is definitely for the time-capsule...This is his lecture series."
5,very very good,I used to put some data files in my mp3 player but soon found out I needed other space to put my stuff in so I got this. I couldn't settle for less than 1 gig since thats what my player had so when I saw that this had 2x as much and was on discount I decided to get it. The transfering is pretty good and thats that my computer says that I keep loading it in a slow flash section of the computer. If it's that fast in the slow one I can't wait until I find the faster input on my computer. I haven't had any problems with it so I highly recommend it.
4,This might actually work,"I have attempted many programs to strengthen my core muscles and loose some excess fat that covers my ""six-pack"". Jorge Cruise has motivated me to conquer two of the most difficult aspects: 1. actually adding the requiem to my life style and 2. continuing to use it.Thanks."
1,NOT WORTH THE PRICE,FIRST- PLAY YOUR DVD AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE THEM AS DISC 1 WAS UNPLAYABLE IN MY CASE.SECOND-DO NOT GET YOUR HOPES HIGH AS THE DISCS ARE VERY REPETITIVE AND COULD EASILLY HAVE FIT ON ONE DISC AND MADE MORE AFFORDABLE.THIRD-THERE IS NO GOOD DESCRIPTION OF THE WEIGHTS REQUIRED FOR THE EXERCISES.ALL IN ALL POOR VALUE AND GOOD LUCK FOLLOWING THE DISCS AND TRYING TO EXERCISE AT THE SAME TIME.
3,Light workout,"This is a nice quick workout, but very light. I have doubled up and done the workout twice and that felt more like a workout, but of course took more time. I have also added weight to make it challenging enough with only 4 reps. He really emphasizes good form and breathing. This would make a good travel workout after a day of meetings."
2,"Good idea, but not good results",Bought the DVDs to see if I got better results than following the book. Have not accomplished what Jorge says will happen.
5,longest 2 seconds,"This is a well done exercise program. It relies on very slow movements and the holding the maximum stressed position for 2 seconds. That doesn't seem very long until you have done the 3rd rep and are trying to hold that position for the last time. I was amazed that such a slow moving exercise could be aerobic as well. I am just beginning, so the results remain to be seen, but to start with, it is very good."
5,Good frame!,"I ordered this white picture frame directly from Amazon. It is not fancy but is a good, solid frame. Nothing fancy but it does the job! The frame was packaged very well and arrived in perfect condition!"
3,nice frame,"I think this is a nice frame, but was kinda pricey. I don't think I would buy another one at the same price."
4,Possibly the best choice for an 80x15mm fan,"I purchased this fan for use on a video card heatsink. The original fan's bearings failed, and I was able to detach it and strap this Evercool fan on in its place. The application required a 15mm fan for sufficient clearance between the cooler and my other video card.The fan runs at around 2800 RPM and moves about as much air as a low speed 25mm thick fan (I compared it to an old 80mm L series Panaflo), which seems to be adequate for my purpose. Noise is about what you would expect, but there is a very faint whine on top of the fan noise. It's nothing intrusive, but it is there if you listen for it and can stand out over the other fan noise even in a louder case. At 2800 RPM you should expect some noise, and overall this little fan isn't as loud as it could be.I'm very happy with this fan, especially because it's increasingly difficult to find 80mm by 15mm fans. Would definitely purchase again if I ever needed another in this size."
4,Decent fan,"Decent fan for the price. not too big of a selection to choose from when you're looking for a 15MM (thick) fan. Bought a Silenz fan last time and it only lasted 6 months. Noise dB is comparable to the Silenz even though the Silenz is supposed to be the quietest. The jury is still out on the longevity of this fan, since it was installed about a month ago."
3,not that great,"I bought this boom box thinking that it will sound almost like the hi-fi, just because the brand (mtx) and how god are their car speakers and subwoofers. But I'm a little disappointed, it sounds god, but when you put in high volume the speakers sounds with distortion. The bass is to strong, you must equalize your ipod to bass reducer or treble booster.Conclusion: don't buy it if you want excellent sound quality, if you want that buy a hi-hi (I already did it) if you don't care about it and don't want to spend that kind of money I think is the best choice."
2,Warning will not charge Ipods past a 1st Gen without adapter purchased seperatly,"Sounds good for a portable but that being said that main reason for buying this was so my daughter could listen to music and charge her ipod . Well guess what? - if you have a newer ipod (2G, 3G, 4G not sure about the other newer ones ) it won't charge! Even though it says -charges IPODS. Seriously? Yes.After she opened her gift up and we couldn't get her ipod to charge, we found a sticker on the outside of the box that was added after it was manufactured stating that it doesn't charge certain ipods. A lot of good that does when you can't examine the box online. Now we are stuck with this as the seller's policy is to not accept refunds-hmm I should have read the fine details. I bought it because it says Ipods could be charged - what they don't tell you is that it doesn't work for all ipods! Apparently you can buy an adapter.... for more $$..... So just thought I would give anyone else looking to buy this a heads up."
2,"easy, but doesn't sound that great",it sounds really bass heavy. easy to use and simple set up--no tone control though which makes it sound too bass heavy!
2,Heavy reading,This is not the best. You can probably can get something else that it is not that heavy to read. No good for rookies.
5,Escelent condition,The book was in excellent conditions. It shipped fast and I think is pretty good book for beginners in the Software Engineering field.
5,A Superb and Refreshing New Resource,"Ms. Hexter does a wonderful job incorporating interesting facts about the past and present of Cleveland, Ohio with amusing anecdotes. This book should be on every Urban Studies professor's shelf as an irreplacable reference."
4,The Emotional House,"I love this book. It is showing me how my emotional chaos and my house chaos are connected. As I take back control over my house, I am taking back control of my life. Very good subject.Dawn Hawkins"
2,disappointing,For some reason I was expecting picture examples and not a lot of text. People who have trouble decorating need to have visuals.
2,The Emperor's New Age Clothes,"Based on the other reviews, I was eager to read this book. What a disappointment! The decorating advice is the same as every other book: declutter, have comfortable chairs with reading lights, hang some art, put kitchen things where you use them, design your home for you, not based on decorating magazines. What differentiates this book is that the standard material is wrapped in New Age 'spiritual' veils and tassles, so a room now has an ""altar"" instead of a ""focal point."" This lingo might have some value in knocking people into thinking about what they truly want in a home, but if you already have a comfortable home, you won't learn anything new here."
3,www.emotionalhouse.com,"3 things always clean- bathroom, kitchen, sheets - / 5 days. If an item in your home doesn't make you happy, eliminate it! What you allow became acceptable. Introduce at least two ""purely for comfort"" items in every room in your home. HEPA air filter. Accept who you are. Use it or lose it! Art is smart - one object in every room. engage your being at all levels, even the subconscious. [...]"
2,Cheap,I bought these to use while I am jogging and what a mistake that was. I used them once and then bought something else. The ear loops did not secure the headphones at all. The left ear kept falling off and eventually I took them off from annoyance. The sound was god awful as well. It was like listening to your neighbor's static-y TV through an apartment wall. Try jogging with a gramaphone if you want comparible quality and comfort. Avoid these unless you are stationary and hard of hearing.
4,Pretty good for cheap phones,Fits on my ears OK. Can wear it for a few hours without discomfort. They are nice and loud. Not good for noisy areas because they do not block out outside sound. Easy for others to hear your music. Durable. I keep it in my backpack and use for laptop so it gets squished a lot. Wanted something similar to ear bud durability but louder and cheap. This was great.
5,my daughter learned to read on this book,"This is a very fun book, though most of the story is via illustrations due to the limitation of only using a ten word vocabulary.I read this to my daughter once. Then I made ten flash cards and we practiced with them until she knew them backwards, forwards and upside down. Once she learned them, she was ""allowed"" to read the book all by herself and thus began the ""backwards"" tradition of her reading to me instead of me reading to her.She is 25 today and a voracious reader, so this book worked! And it's *fun* to read!"
1,pointy !,I was excited to receive this bra since it seemed to be comfortable and it was by Glamorise. BIG BIG BIG mistake. This is the cheapest made bra I have ever in my 40 years of buying. The cups come out to a point!
3,A little DaDa and lot of BlaBla,"With its short biographical introduction, followed by a long spoken catalog of ""bla bla"", this piece is typical of the ""Artists of the 20th Century"" series. Though quick, easy, cheap and commercially viable to make, they provide precious little inspiration to young artists looking for where to hang their stylistic hats. Even so, the art speaks for itself and is inspiring and the camera work is reasonable.The audio and video feeds are badly enough out of phase that the producers ought to contemplate a financial sacrifice, perish the thought, and release a corrected version. Come on guys!"
1,Not so fast,"This product did not fit properly in my 2003 tacoma, even after heavy filing. Instead I purchased a scosche, and it fit perfectly."
2,Metra Pocket,"The search for dash kit for a 1995 Camry showed this item being correct for this car, although the actual specs said it was for 90-93 Camry's. The itme is glued together instead of molded. It also does not allow the factory trim piece to be reinserted."
4,Cool,"It's okay, I had to read it for a class. He raises some good questions but he's long winded. A lot of us have already thought about these questions. Talbott feeds you some good food for thought though."
3,Not His Best,"While it is still worth a read (although you may want to wait for the paperback),this is my least favorite installment of the Benjamin Justice series. I was disappointed because the book was nowhere near the excellence I had come to expect from John Morgan Wilson. In my opinion, the story was formulaic and trite, compared to Wilson's other books. Other descriptions that come to mind are pale, tame, and completely lacking in punch, compared to his other work. Most authors suffer in comparison to John Morgan Wilson, and in Rhapsody in Blood, unfortunately, so does he."
2,You get what you pay for here,"It can get the job done but it requires a good deal of air to operate. You have to have a pretty good size compressor to get it to operate for more than 60 seconds. I have a 15 gallon, and at 90 psi that is all it would last before the compressor kicked on to recharge the tank. If you do it this way you have to repeat this procedure over and over to get a max vacuum something large like a a/c system. All said and done all at best I could get it to go to -25psi. Specs say it can get to -29, but I don't believe it. Also like the other review said it has a cheap plastic cap to cover the r-12 port when it should have come with a metal one."
1,be aware its 100% polyester!!!!sending it back cancelling the CC charge,"total scam!!! I have looking for so long for smth made of real wool and happy to find it, but when it arrived and i looked at the pakage i was surprised it looked so small, but when i opened it i was even more surprised.its 100% plush poyester, it says all over the package ""plush polyester""100&.it is outrageous! the product has a very specific detailed description ""australian lamb's wool"", I am reurning t tomorrow, and also cancelling the credit card charge, btw they dont provide return labels."
3,small is very small!,"I just received the snuggle bub wrap. I ordered the small size for my 8 month old baby and immediately tried it out in our stroller with him inside. His feet were almost touching the bottom of the wrap! He is regarding his lenght in the 85th to 90th percentile. If you have a long baby spare yourself the hassle of returning and go straight for the larger size. Here on the amazon site it says size small is for up to 2 years but on the actual packaging it says up to 18 months. I also imagined the lambswool to be softer and the outside fabric attracts a lot of fuzz (petowners beware). Since the quality is not so nice I would recommend getting this item on sale (a real sale, not the 5-cents-of-the-original-prize kind of sale). It does look nice though. Will return mine for a larger size."
2,Behold a Red Horse Review,"I was prepared to thoroughly enjoy the book, my first, by Cotton Smith. I just could not stay with it and ended up speed reading the last two thirds of the book. It started out well enough but it got bogged down in unnecessary character development. It was too slow and lacked the grittiness that I like in action/adventure/ western genres.Cotton is familiar with the ways and customs of the historic cattle drives but the interactions of the supporting characters was shallow without the benefit of the rough and tumble action associated with other westerns.Cole was too much the perfect gunfighter/fighter that is so often found in the romantic nonsense of the western. He would have been better developed with some failings. He was a bit like Zane Grey and Louis L""Amore's characters that can outride, outfight, outshoot everyone they come across. Characters are more believable when they have weaknesses as well as strengths."
5,condition,This arrived in excellent condition. The musical score of Titanic: A New Musical is very exciting. I can't wait to be part of this show.
4,degrassi lifes!,I like the degrassi series but I wished they showed more african love black boy loves black girl. not only one couple for example three couples. the three couples should have dark skin then I would be more pleased. the blacks on the show always are fair skinned. I would like to see the blacks more darker than fair.
4,Should they just end it already?,"Degrassi Season 8 isn't the best season of Degrassi. Most of the original cast has moved on. It takes a while to get use to the new cast of characters. Most of the time the episodes of Season 8 are just flat out boring. A lot of the new characters are emotionless, annoying, or flat out horrible (Conner anyone?). One great thing about the DVD set is that it includes the Degrassi Goes Hollywood movie! In widescreen 16:9 format also! However, the rest of the season is in full screen 4:3 ratio? What gives? The N showed the episodes in widescreen, but the dvd doesn't? Also, the dvd set doesn't even have subtitles for anything! It's 2009! Unacceptable! Not the best season but a few episodes are worth checking out..."
4,Strongest Showing yet,"The band has their strongest showing on this third recording. Traipsing through a melange of styles influenced by the oft-mentioned like of GoF and PIL (and the Clash on this record), Radio 4 somehow adds new textures and depth to their songs that create unique new sounds. With slashing linear guitars and reggae back beats, the drum/bass heavy production references respect for the still unique sound of PiL's Metal Box (still in a class by itself). This recording is a delight all the way through, with my personal favorites the rocker ""Enemies Like Us"" and the reggae ""Ascension Street"". Why this band has not broken out like the other NY bands of their vintage remains a mystery to me, as the music is the equal of Interpol and better than the Strokes."
1,Too big of a gap,"I should have returned these, but I forgot to do so in time. I bought a RG6 cable and these were loose and didn't hold the cable tight. And since it has a plastic end, there is nothing you can do to make them tight. I went to Menards and bought a different brand of the same size and they fit perfect."
1,piece of s***,this product is so useless. the nail is so short that it wont even go into your wall. wish I can return this trash.
5,Great Way To Clip Wires,"Very good price, fast and easy shipping. A perfect product for me to clip cable wires to the wall at the floor line. Well made and easy to handle.I like Amazon Partners as they all stand up well with good products and no problems."
5,Great buy,"Got these with some flat Ethernet cable to wire in house (didnt want to go through/inside walls). Great little things. Good value for 100. Pretty sturdy, too."
2,A little disappointed.,"These clips are much too small. I read in a review that they couldn't hold an ethernet cable but I figured my coaxle cable was smaller so they should work, wrong! It barely goes around it and I wanted it for my speaker wire at the same time. Good thing I only spent $4 or I would really be upset."
4,"Exactly as described, gets the job done","This is a good product that appears to be well-made. It did the job exactly as I desired. It fits a small cable only, however. Anything bigger than ethernet cable (cat-5) probably won't fit. Great price, no complaints."
2,very short nails - barely works,"These clips have very short nails. They barely work. I could not recommend this product. If the product had longer nails, I would recommend. But because of the short nails, it's hard to hold while nailing and they don't stay in in the wall."
3,Larger than described.,"The clips have done the job, though not as neatly as hoped. The clips are too large to snugly hold an RJ45 patch cable. I had to angle the clips to keep the cable straight."
4,These cable-clips work just fine,"It's cable-clips, you don't need some fancy brand name ones (do they have brand name cable clips?). I hammered them to the wall with no problems. I used maybe half the bag and didn't encounter any defective ones. Overall, if you need cable clips for cheap, these do the job."
2,Didn't fit,Did not fit any of my RG6 cables without damaging them. Clips did not come high enough to cover the cable. The nail is very short as well which can sometimes be a pain to get to it to stay. It wasnt a total waste of a buy because i was able to find another use for much small cables but did not fit any RG6 cables as specified.
4,Does the job but...,"The clip material was a lot thinner than I expected. I would consider these very light duty. However, in my application they work fine and you can't beat the price."
3,OK nails but could be better,"a) These nails are too loose for cat5 ethernet cable. They can hold its weight but you can't tighten the cable with them.b) The actual metal piece of nail is too thick, so you can only hammer it into soft wood. With plinth I have at home, it takes forever to hammer it, and it's hard to hold the nail and hammer it at the same time (and almost impossible to do without holding)."
1,No good for my CAT 5e cable,"After selecting a CAT5e cable these cable clips were suggested as ""Frequently bought together"". On that recommendation these were ordered. But when they arrived it was obvious that the clip was far to large to securely hold the cable that it was matched with on the website. You could easily fit 4 cables into each clip. More suitable for large co-ax cable."
1,too small!,i hate these things. there is not enough nail to hold without smashing your finger or becoming irate. they suck.
1,Amazon is ripping you off on these,"Don't buy these from Amazon. They rip you off.I looked at the price they have listed, it was about $7, then I looked at the prices they had listed from other retailers,(which is a cool feature) all of them some combination of cheap price($2) with high shipping($6) or vice versa. I figured, ""I'm already buying cable which is of course why i am looking for clips. Might as well."" And went to check out since they were advertising free shipping on purchases over $20.Finding the shipping for a single item was really hard. Maybe I just missed it, but I had to add each item on it's own to see what the shipping would cost, which is weird since everything comes from different places. Shipping came to $8 for a bag of these. For that amount you can get 2 bags from the other guys."
5,A great read,"I really enjoy this book. It is very informative, and I found myself breezing right through it because I found the information and writing style so refreshing and useful. It sort of breaks down the basic NOLS overview and covers quite the range of topics for outdoor activities, chiefly backpacking. A very useful guide if you intend to make some trips to the backcountry and enjoy the beautiful land we are blessed with. A great book to start with if you are at all interested in a NOLS course, or just interested in the outdoor aspect of life."
2,Hamstrung by the past,"I've read a lot of backpacking books and go on backpacking trips each month. A lightweight pack is a better way.You'll love this book, if you think a 5,000ci pack is required for 2 night trips and a 4,000ci pack is required for an overnight, if you think heavy boots are required, or bringing a heavy fleece jacket or wool sweater is good advice.It covers a lot of different topics. Unlike other books written by ""traditional"" backpackers, such as O'Bannon's Backpackin' Book, I didn't feel like I skimmed some good ideas from a knowledgeable and experienced traditionalist backpacker. It was mainly regurgitating dogma, some of which is good advice (but readily available from other sources) and much of it myth."
3,Not as Big as it appears,"Product arrived on time and as promised. However, I was surprised by how small the container of Knex was. Having not bought any of these for 10+ years they seem to have shrunk in size ( or perhaps my memory is poor). The quantity included in this tub is enough to make a small project but realistically a child would need 1000+ Knex for a decent-sized project."
1,So dissapointed,"I expected with 400 pieces, to have a large verity of pieces my kids could use to build things.When we opened it, we found a combo of lego pieces and tiny little bits that were useless. My kid snapped a rod in two within a few minutes. The pieces are micro sized, like the itty bitty legos. Which is NOT what we wanted. There were no normal sized knex at all in the box. Its a large carrying case box, but less then a 1/8th is filled with pieces. Because they are micro legos and micro knex.Im so bummed out because i wanted a great kit for my kids to have for Christmas and this set isnt something that any of them can or want to use.It would be nice if the listing specified that these are MINI knex or MICRO knex and NOT regular sized ones. And that half the piece sin the tub are lego pieces.The size of the plastic tub is very misleading. You get a large plastic tub and expect it to be filled with knex and instead you get tiny micro legos that fit in snack bags."
2,Pieces are WAY too small!,"I purchased this item for my after school program. I was expecting the larger traditional K'nex pieces. However, upon receiving this item I was shocked to see that there were 2 small bags that contained several extremely small pieces that even some 7 year olds might not be able to play with. The pieces hardly cover the bottom of the deceivingly large box they come in. Only a dozen of the pieces were the size of normal K'nex. Unfortunatly this item will only be limited for the oldest kids in my after school program to play with."
1,many TINY pieces,"This set comes with a ton of teeny tiny pieces. I was expecting regular sizes k'nex. I am VERY disappointed, especially since return shipping is not free."
4,Good kit.,"Great for 8 year old working by himself (thank goodness-- finally) not too complicated. Picture instructions ar easy to follow. I would recommend getting a second set if you find them on sale-- some of the models are 1 dimensional, by makin the mirror image you could have a fuller model. Plenty of room in the bucket for more pieces."
5,Better than Lego,"'I bought a used set. but found that it is better than the expensive lego sets I have for my children. I help them build motor cycle, farm vehicles, racing cars, and tricycles that ran very fast and firm than lego cars. I like K'Nex, you can build more with less investment."
4,Lots of Fun!!,My 9-year old nephew loves this and is always playing with it!! He finds new ways to enjoy it and new things to make each time he plays with it - which is every time he comes over!!
1,never got,I never got my item not happy about this at all i want my money back asap this was for my kids Christmas
3,Warning: Read the box carefully!,"I did not read closely enough and was surprised when this item arrived. Yes it IS 400 pieces, BUT they are very tiny!! Not at all like the connects I was expecting. My 4 year old couldn't have them :-( but since it was my fault I didn't return them. I just looked for a family friend to give them to."
3,Not to many,Ordered this for my 3 year old the pieces are very small. I would not recommend it for anyone under the age of 8
2,should have stated that you need the blue set to actually build something,Cool set...but useless without buying the other blue set. Can't build anything in the build book without the combination of both the blue and the red set together. Purchased this as a gift for someone and could not do anything with it. Quality is not as good as the originals. But here's plus... you can use legos with this set of knex.
2,"Good price, but was disappointed","I thought the pieces would be bigger. The pieces are mostly small, which I expected small pieces but there were not alot of bigger pieces like I thought there would be as it looks on the picture. They barely fill the bottom of the bucket they come in."
3,Not the old Knex,"I must say I was very happy with speed at which we received the shipment, however I am very disappointed with the Knex product. The pieces are miniature and barely fill the bottom of tub they are in. One of the pieces also broke after a few uses. My older son had a set about 7 years ago. The pieces were big and the tub came full. The pieces were also a lot harder to break. If this is the new way Knex is making their products I would advise looking on Ebay for their older products. I am glad my son is having fun with the toy though. Unfortunately I'm not sure how long the pieces will last and with them being so small how soon it will be before he looses them all."
1,These are MINI-k'nex..,"Ok, so my son was all excited to get an Amazon.com gift card. He searched for what he wanted and found this 400 ct. box of K'nex. It came in the mail pretty quick but SUPRISE - these are mini-k'nex and won't work with the full size K'nex that he already has. There is nothing in the description that says this. Beware."
1,These are not the original size,Only about 15 knex pieces were the original size. All of the rest are really small. If you are looking for normal sized knex do not buy this set.
4,great gift,This was a great price... I ended up giving it to my 35 yr old brother and he and the kids were playing with it pretty quickly shortly after opening it. Looked like they were having fun.
5,a gift and the receiver loved it.,K'nex turned out to be a great gift to a young boy and he has enjoyed playing with on a daily basis.
5,great for all ages.,"just supervise young kids since these are so small they can inhale or choke on pieces. i use this with a 2 and 8 yr old boys to keep them preoccupied for... very long. that's one of their favorite toys and i like it that they both play nicely with it. there's enough for 2 small kids, but couldn't hurt to have more sets. fun for adults too (to use the book)."
3,Not what I expected,Not a product problem...just that I have an old set that I expected to be adding to and the size isdifferent....these are very small. I was so disappointed
5,love this!,Grandson loves Knex and will be thrilled to receive this! the price was perfect (daily deal) and just a few clicks and a few days and it was at my door!
4,Great to have on hand to replace extra parts from sets,"I'm ordering this set because my dog ate one connector from a roller coaster set during construction, and there were no accidental extra parts in the set. I figure it's probably a good idea to order a tub full of extra pieces for when this happens. :) These are the ""micro"" pieces which will easily be lost or eaten by my dog. haha"
3,Replacement Copy,"I borrowed this from a neighbor and lost it. This was a replacement for them. It is old, but useful."
2,specious reasoning,"as a black man who raised himself up from the inner city projects of los angeles, i can say this book is utter nonsense. i took responsibility for my actions while others did not; now i am a sucessfull business person while others in my community chose to be irresponsible.others chose to have children out of wedlock and use drugs. i worked hard and dr. dyson undermines my hard work and blames all of the problems on the 'system.'the only reason dyson has a job at upenn is because of affirmitive action. get real dr. dyson, i worked hard and overcame. others can also. stop blaming whites, koreans, and the govt. for problems that blacks bring onto themselves.women choose to have children outside of wedlock. so mostly likely if there is only one parent avaibalbe then the child will grow up poor. use common sense."
1,I'd give it negative stars if I could,"I am a professional black woman from humble roots. I'm about to read a book that counters this one, and I wanted to at least get the author's point of view.I got to page eight. At page eight, I couldn't take the socialist rantings and the ""Black people are victims,"" whining.I am of what Mr. Dyson considers the ""Afrostocary"": I am a black woman with a college degree and a professional job. I worked my tail off to get where I am, and I refuse to be anyone's victim. I will not apologize for that."
4,Cosby WAS wrong ...,"Dyson's book is correct.Morality has nothing to do with class, culture, race or gender!The defenseless poor, without all the advantages of the upper classes, just mimic and fall victim to all the problems that permeate society as a whole.The only difference is the upper and middle classes think they can do whatever they want (bed-hopping, drug abuse, cultural ignorance & white collar crimes that are actually more harmful to society to petty cash street stuff) and escape social responsibility.Things only become ""serious problems"" when upper classes are bored & indifferent enough to focus attention on the poor masses ONLY WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT to blame them.Great read, even better topic written by a champion brave enough to stand up for the poor and bold enough to call out America's favorite dad when he's wrong."
1,This book is tripe,"Bill Cosby speaks the truth and then you have people like Dyson trying to shoot him down for speaking that truth. As an educated black Ph.D., I find Dyson's book offensive to intelligent people who expect more from themselves. Dyson should use his time more wisely than to shoot down Bill Cosby for speaking a truth that more black people need to hear."
4,Good book,Dr. Dyson has done a good job with defending his stance with what Dr. Cosby said. He looks at the issue from top to bottom and then givesd insight for what he said. An excellent book whether you agree with him or not.
1,Why?,"I don't know why this guy would preach AGAINST taking personal responsablitiy. Oh yes I do, he's got an agenda. Thankfully American, especially black America is wising up to the left's agenda.My guess is that, instead of learning from Bill Cosby and others like him, Dyson's just going to yell a little louder next time."
1,Blame Whitey While The Rest Of The World Passes You By,"I learned long ago that the more a person yells and talks over people, the more scared they are you may recognize their message is BS. I also heard him on Air America and his rant would be a joke if it wasn't for the huge amount of pliable minds that swallow his hokum hook, line and sinker. Indians have used proficiency in english along with a solid family structure, hard work ethic and respect for education to transform their country and take jobs that would be filled by black American youth if they weren't so busy listening to snake oil slaesmen like Dyson, Jackson et al."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I'm a white guy, but am interested in understanding black perspectives on problems within the black community. To a large extent, the portion of the book I read didn't address Mr. Cosby's comments but instead attacked Mr. Cosby as a person. Professor Dyson's ad hominem arguments are what turned me off.I was expecting an interesting, well supported discussion of 1. whether the statements Mr. Cosby made are true (backed by evidence) and 2. how best to address these concerns. Instead, I got diatribes about what Mr. Cosby's comedy style should have been (more ""Black"" with less universal appeal), and Mr. Cosby's educational and moral failings.Professor Dyson should be capable of addressing the issues raised by Mr. Cosby without ad hominem attacks. Sorry to say, I couldn't finish the book, because Dyson didn't seem to have anything interesting to say."
3,Cosby book review,"My book was in good condition. The content was decent. Dyson could simplify his writing some. He is extremely ""wordy"" at times."
1,Yes Dr. Cosby is Right,This book was a waste of paper and my time.Dyson needs to stick to teaching and leave authoring books alone. If he truly believed all the crap he writes abouthe would be teaching at an HBCU instead of the Ivy leagueuniversities BUT alas he needed to write about something andI guess Bill Cosby was an easy target. Face it Dyson...COSBY IS RIGHT.
2,Is Cosby Right,Dr.Dyson was out to kill the messenger and in so doing he missed the message. Cosby was/is right
1,This book doesn't offer any solutions,The only thing Mr. Dyson does it blame everyone else. It's time for blacks to accept responsibility. Mr. Cosby was right. The hip/hop culture doesn't do anything to enhance the images of blacks in America. Children in the inner city should know that getting an education is just as important as working on your jump-shot. I didn't get a sense of that in this book.
1,Lacks Soul,"I got this CD a couple of weeks ago, played it once, and gave it away. It sounds like Mr. Barris is afraid of his guitar. None of his compositions stand out. I found it to be very, very mediocre (actually, below mediocre). Hard to believe I heard the same CD as other reviewers."
4,Hope it works,"I have a bathroom in a condo built in the 70's that was wallpapered without the drywall being primed first. I could remove the wallpaper but not the adhesive. After much research, I decided that Gardz was the perfect coating to seal off the wallpaper glue and provide a good base for a skim coat (which I had to do to even out the wall). A coat of primer and paint and the walls look great--so far. Time will tell!At any rate this product was very easy to apply, with paint brush or roller, and clean up."
5,"Quote the Raven, Nevermore",Raven is a mad man and so very entertaining to watch. I have lots of wrestling DVD's and this is one of my favorites. Great 2 disc set.
3,Hey pepole shut up.,Please peplole go outside and the kid bewolw me you are notaj styles because he wants to stay with tna not wweso shut up.
4,THIS IS WHAT PLUGS INTO OEM STEREO,"I purchased this by mistake. I wanted a kit that would plug into my Toyota so I could install an aftermarket stereo. This kit does not satisfy my needs. This kit is designed to plug into the factory oem stereo. Not a bad product, all the wires were color coded correctly and were pre-stripped in a nice fashion. I would reccomend this company as the quality is very apparent. Just want to warn others so they don't do the same thing as me."
4,Metra radio kit is a must!,"I upgraded my 07 Corolla radio to a Pioneer DVD. I didn't want to cut the original wires from the factory harness because I would be putting the OEM radio back in if I ever sold the car. The Metra kit comes two ways, to plug into your factory harness or to plug into your factory radio. I bought both for two reasons, convenience. I wanted to ensure that I had plenty of wiring options to install the Pioneer without cuttig ANY wires. The wires were all properly color coordinated to my factory harness and I rarely had to refer to the (provided) wiring schematic in the Metra package. It was easy, it was complete and my DVD works perfect with not one wire being cut. Metra offers a large variety of installation accessories for MOST cars. Most of the kits are dirt cheap but worth their weight in gold. Do not install an aftermarket radio in your vehicle without a Metra installation kit."
5,The Dark Side,"The book stands out because it forces you to take a look at the dark side of leadership. It is about leadership in and of itself. The book has an entirely unique perspective on leadership. She looks at all leaders and how they measure up as leaders. Even if society views them as a bad leader she takes that and builds on some of their strengths as a leader, their weaknesses and not necessarily their intent. The actual process of leading is the focus. She also looks at the followers and their role in leadership. This I think is also unique to leadership. It is important to analyze the followers and how they can affect the leader. In looking at the dark side of leadership we are able to become better leaders and/or followers."
1,"Bad leadership, worse content","This book promises much but delivers little. Barbara Kellerman describes seven random 'categories' of leadership plucked from who knows where (she doesn't say), demonstrating a total inability to exercise conceptual rigour as well as a fondness for her own imaginings. The book is repetitious, full of waffle and padding, and relentlessly superficial. And it is biased.The glibness of her political analyses and the personally vindictive nature of her criticism of various public figures based on a concoction of little more than rumour and gossip is dismaying. She has added nothing to the sum of human knowledge - except an awareness of her own prejudices.If you really want to know more about leadership - this is not the book for you."
1,"Unfortunately, a biased and trite view of interesting topic","I've read the book and just heard the author on NPR. While I agree with another reviewer that the view of Clinton is particularly biased, I was willing to overlook the bias if some interesting and rigorous research emerged. Unfortunately, the author's qualitative study reflects more her own ad hoc categories and less a realistic assessment of the leadership behaviors and styles of the subjects.This is a classic example of bad business, management, and leadership writing not grounded in rigorous empirical research. For better views of rigorous leadership research, start with books by Ed Locke, Pfeffer, and Sutton.- A Student of Organizational Behavior"
3,Concise would be nice,"The ""Bad Leadership"" concept pulled me in. PR summaries on this book were better written than what I have muddled through so far. This book is word heavy. Barbara could use a little help from Suzy Welch, who I suspect helped Jack Welch with ""Winning"" an improvement in writing style of ""From the Gut"". Enjoying both Welch's books the improved difference is concise focus in Winning. The first half of Bad Leadership has been labor intense, with a modest return for my reading time investment. Reading for information readily consumable, this book has good intentions but modestly delivers . I have not committed to finishing, as there are better reads that easily pulled me away."
2,Seems Biased,"Bill Clinton stopped the ethnic cleansing in the Balkans by magnificent leadership when George H Bush had done nothing about it. Clinton worked tiredlessly for peace in Ireland and the Middle East, yet she chooses Bill Clinton as a bad leader. Bill Clinton gets standing ovations when he goes to foreign countries, Bush Jr gets demonstrations showing the American flag with swasticas painted on it. So who is the bad leader? More right wing garbage. What else is new?"
1,Go read a history book.,"I didn't even finish this book. I should have been warned when I saw the two whole pages at the beginning listing ""Fictional Characters"" and ""Historical Characters."" About a dozen people are listed in each category, and we're not supposed to get confused? The two main characters are interesting enough, but the history is integrated into the book laboriously and in piece-together fashion, and does nothing to enhance the story. While I found Tancred Redwan and Helena both quite promising as multi-dimensional characters, I simply could not get past the history that bogged down the story. If an author cannot use ""facts within fiction"" better than this, he/she should please not try! I also disliked Linda Chaikin's writing style immensely--but that is only a personal opinion and probably not a valid criticism. Don't bother with this book, even if you like historical fiction! A history book is often less tedious than all the history in ""Swords and Scimitars."""
2,Wouldn't Recommend,"This CD isn't the greatest. The songs are not played by an orchestra but only by a few instruments that make up a kind of 'tangy' sound. Don't exactly know how to explain it but I wouldn't recommend it. Traditional Mozart, Beethoven, etc. is better."
4,Wonderful cd,Great baby cd. Very soothing and relaxing we enjoy listening to it each evening before bedtime.
2,Don't waste your money,"This move was a waste of time we will never recover. Sad because it had a lot of potential, I was really disappointed."
3,"Music was fine, all the yak in between wasn't","The music was fun to listen to, however between each song was a long and ambiguous narrative. The narrative made it impossible to use the music as background music as it seem to constantly be interrupting the spirit and flow of the songs."
5,Classic,"Tony Bennett is an American classic. His collaborations are touching, soulful, and done with taste and refinement. He has his duet partners record in a room with a band without headphones. How many modern artists record in this pure way? It's a revelation to see someone who was there at the inception of the record industry, keeping it honest today."
1,I left my heart at the Bose machine,"I was greatly disappointed as neither of the two cd's would play (two copies of the same, one for a gift)I even tried them on my car radio and had the same resultI am still waiting for the credit"
3,Tony Bennett Duets II,this was good but not great. If you are a Tony Bennett fan it is certainly enjoyable but I have the CD and I prefer it.
2,tony bennett,"I shouldn't have purchased this. Got it not thru Amazon but in a store. If you're not at least 70 yrs old, you'd be disappointed in the old time songs."
4,great dvd,"The interviews really add to the 1st rate music.Contains Amy Winehouse's last recording & even tho ""Blue Velvet"" is a classic Bennett recording excellent as a solo with k d Lang the song goes to a whole new level."
5,A Must Have DVD!,Generally I dislike duet CD's and DVD's as they are not done live. Apparently the singers are at two different locations and joined together electronically and usually mismatched. This DVD is done live with great interaction between Tony and the other great performers with fabulous background music. This is a fantastic DVD and a joy to watch over and over. Tony is 85 and can still sing and looks great. He sings many of my favorite songs of all times.
1,tony bennet duets,I really resent the type of ad being used to sell this piece of junk. Blocking my whole page and having to come to this page to get rid of it meanwhile interrupting the work I was doing. REMOVE MY EMAIL FROM YOUR AD LIST I DIDN'T LIKE THIS SCHMUCK WHEN HE WAS FRESH AND CURRENT.
1,Annoying,This guy has lost it Who wants to listen to an 85 year old sing. What's worse is that he's become an embarresment. He seems to come out weekly with a goofy left leaning comment. If you can't score with the music give it up. There are too many washed up people out there who turn to left wing comments to score points with the masses to survive.
4,CHEAP NEW,ITEM LOOKS GOOD IN THE TRUCK BUT WOULD NOT BUY FOR A SHOW TRUCK EXCELLENT FOR EVERYDAY DRIVER HOPE THIS HELPS
4,Good melding of genres,"Although the packaging may appear to be a bit trite with what seems like yet another B-grade horror film touting the spooks that it has in store for its prospective audience I found it to have more originality than that.The soundtrack for example during the opening credits was on par with Ennio Morricone,it has numerous gothic elements as well as old western.The photography is lush, and there is some comic relief provided by one of the supporting characters pet dog."
5,Very nice Floor lamp,"Very nice lamp!! Heavy,not cheaply made.I have please with all of my purchases from Lamp Plus and this one is excellent also.Quality lamp."
2,"Terrific concept, unevenly executed","I was delighted to find and read this book: what a terrific concept! The BDSM community is portrayed here as just a background (a little like Cabot Cove, Maine, right?) to a murder mystery. It's refreshing to see this kind of background in a novel, where it's not all just about it being different, but rather about it being acceptable and not even remarked upon. And Warren's humor, too, is refreshing: it's an element far too often missing from books dealing with sex.Unfortunately, the mystery part is somewhat less than mysterious. It's too easy to guess the identity of the murderer. Warren has great potential: if he could enter into the noir world with the same dexterity with which he manages the BDSM milieu, he'll do well. In the meantime, however, his plotting needs a little help - from Roissy, or elsewhere.--- Jeannette Angell, author of Callgirl"
4,A Good Story Is Hard To Find,It's hard to find well written erotic bdsm fiction. Murder at Roissy is just that. John Warren's latest work is an erotic whodunnit that is well worth reading.
3,Can you call a BDSM mystery pleasant? Yes.,I spotted the murderer even before the murder took place! but you will find this a charmingly written story in an unusual setting -- a private spa for BDSMers. A nice read for summer days or in front of the fireplace in the winter.
2,Too hard for beginners and intermediate,This book is definitely for the advanced to very advanced players. Definitely not recommended for anyone below 1800.
2,Excellent Material -Poorly Printed and a waste,"Mark Dvoretsky is the ultimate teacher and trainer. I had previously bought the 1st Edition of this book. I had high expectations for the expanded 2nd Edition, however, the publisher really messed up and used such a light shade of blue ink, which highlights the key critical sections in each chapter, that is makes it impossible to read even in the best light conditions.I thought this was a bad batch and ordered another copy, but again, the same problem with a second delivery. It turns out, all of the batch printings of this Edition are like this, which, unfortunately, makes purchasing this book a waste of money.How sad!!! I am deeply disappointed."
5,Robin,This book was a gift request from my chess playing son. He loves it. He said it is so far beyond anything he expected.
5,"Amazing, but not for beginners.","As a 2000 rated USCF chess player, I started learning new ideas from page ONE. If you want to improve your game, this is absolutely one of the books you must buy.If you haven't read any other book on endgames, it's probably best not to start with this one. The author will drop off at certain points because they are ""obvious"", and if you're not completely familiar with common endgame motifs it will be almost impossible to understand."
2,A mother's review,"Overall I liked the message of friendship crossing social barriers, and the reality of the characters life, however I agree with the young reviewer in that there are too many conflicts. I would have rated the book higher but I consider the cursing out of place for a book targeting children from 9 to 12. Despite they can learn to curse from other sources, I believe a children's author should not contribute to teaching anything detrimental for a young mind."
1,Ack!,"Man, this book is really annoying and boring, it ended horribly and makes you wonder. There are too many conflicts going on all at the same time. I hated this book and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Blah."
5,Holds your interest from cover to cover!,"This is an excellent book for juveniles to adults. It is interesting, emotional, and very well written. As a middle school teacher, I highly recommend it for middle school students (7th/8th grade level)."
5,Lesson: Judgement,"That first day of school can make you or break you. Unfortunately, for Phyllisia is made her day. She had a brawl in front of school the same week. Adults looking out of their windows...just looking not helping. The young girls gets teased and into a fight in the first week. Wow! Then, she has to the audacity to judge the one person that attempts to be her friend, Edith - the ragamuffin that has holes in her stockings. Judgement was her downfall; but she learned to work with Edith. They became best friends. The lesson is don't judge people you don't know. As she learns about Edith, she learns about herself. A book that I believe every girl should read before they finish Junior High. I read it a little late - age 15."
4,This is the best book for teenagers!,"If you don't believe that a person can be changed, you should read ""The Friends."" In ""The Friends"" a West Indian girl named Phyllisia got made fun of and beat up in school but a poor girl with untidy stockings stood up in front of the class and told them to stop. That was my favorate part. Unlike many other people Phyllisia still didn't like Edith. Even after all she did for her, Phyllisia just didn't like her appearance. That continued for a long time until one day Phyllisia started realizing it just isn't appearance that matters, but what is inside. I would recommend this book for young adults because I love how the author takes you through all the stages of life like love, hate, sorrow, happiness, and many more. I really liked this book, and I'm sure you'll love it too!"
4,"A good an very realistic book, everybody read it!","I liked this book very much, I'm a 13 year old girl from Finland and I`m sure some of these sad events are true here in Finland too.I recommend this book to everybody! Get up from your chair and go to library!"
5,"""Friends"" is a down to earth story about two good friends.","I recommend ""Friends"" by Rosa Guy, because it's a really good down to earth story about two good friends, and if you like scary books get any book by R.L. Stine, (""Curtains"", "" The Window"", ""The Boyfriend""). I rate both books about a 9, because all the books keep you in suspense. The book ""Friends"" was about two girls who were the total oppposite, but became great friends in the end. I don't really remember anything about the R. L Stine stories, all I remember was that all the books were kind of scary, and you could read a whole entire book in one night. I really liked these books because they weren't boring, and depressing"
4,A very realistic and moving book,I would recommend this to everyone. After reading this book I needed to know more about what happens afterwards. If you want a griping and relatively easy read this is the book for you!
2,"The Friends, by Rosa Guy, book review","My fifteen-year-old daughter is bright, obedient, and appriciative - but I learned an important lesson when I ordered this childhood favorite of mine... ""IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A BOOK TO GO OUT OF STYLE OR BECOME OUT-DATED!"" My daughter is an avid reader, and she's usually not too picky with her reading materials, but presenting her with this book was like showing the movie 'The Sound of Music' to an atrium full of eigth graders and expecting them to love it. If you want to present your teenage daughter with one of your old favorites, then 'The Outsiders,' or anything by S.E. Hinton would be the route to go - defanately not the Rosa Guy route!"
3,"Overall ""Good"", but could be better","Rosa Guy had a great idea for this book. Phyllisia and Edith had a really nice friendship too. I felt many topics were left unexplained. Many events in Phyllisia's life were just left alone after they were mentioned. I really wanted to know what happened to many of them. You will probably see what I mean when you read the book. But, I will give this book credit. I would recommend this book to other readers. It's really full of events."
4,tamara'z review,"The book The Friends by Rosa Guy was very interesting and entertaining. The book is centered on Phyllisia, and her best friend Edith. As far as money and family ties, they are complete opposites. I think the situations she faced were very well plotted, such as her mother having breast cancer, and dying. I also think the way the characters were introduced, and all had a time in the spotlight was very ""artistic"". It was a good book."
4,Very Useful list of creative names,"My wife and I were really struggling trying to give our dog good name that would also be a little creative. A variety of lists on web pages didn't do the trick. Ten minutes with this book and we had our name (Lira). We also came up with several other really good ones I would have never thought of otherwise. If you want to name your dog something other than Max or Maggie (though those are good names), give this book a try."
2,"Interesting, but Lacking Substance.",The book should have been titled Satan's Music. I thought the author was taking way to space talking about hiddin messages and not enough about true Rock n' Roll mysteries. The book started good and faded near the middle. I wish he would have taken more time to discuss why Jimmy Page was so obsessed with Alester Crowley.
2,super memory-super student hot to raise your grades in 30days,"Anatomy lab Dr. Recommended to read this book. I bought the book, thinking it would help. I really had no time to read it."
1,not so good!!,"No change for me.I need more than just this, cos i can do it better with my style of learning.Anybody else can tell me more than just 'kiddy way'?"
2,Super Memory Super Student,"Did not like it,did not help me at all. Would not purchase it again. Will look elsewhere to find me something to learn by."
5,helpful website of peg words,"As for the review, don't expect the book to improve you memory in seconds.The activities in this book will take some effort and time.. and you have to do this each time you want to memorize something.Still, this book will work if you stick by it.Also those who are already familiar with memory techniques will not find much new to learn.For those who read the book, I found this helpful website of pegwords to remember certain numbers (the kinds described in the book) so you don't have to spend time thinking of them. It has over 1000+ words which you can click through or you can search the number to find the corresponding pegword.[...]Thought I'd share cause I found it extremely helpful."
5,Excellent techniques!,"If you're looking to improve your memory for high school or college this is the book! You must be a active reader and not passive. Do the worksheets and you'll be amazed how your memory improves.I'd definetly recommend this book to everyone I know. After about a week of doing the worksheets I was able to impress others with my memory. Buy this book, you won't be disappointed."
5,A Great Memory Book,"Some of the tips in this book are not really tips--they're just a part of common sense that lost commonality (like many things). We remember better if we can make silly connections. That's why adults have difficulty remembering--they're too serious! As such, your inner critic will kill this book if you are too serious. You need to be creative and, most importantly, you need to have fun while reading it. Don't treat it like an organic chemistry textbook, or any other textbook for that matter. If you can resist that temptation and have fun, this book will do wonders."
4,"Excellent material, but not enough","Steve Jackson Games has done it again. Yet another excellent roleplaying supplement has come off their press. Cyberpunk has all sorts of things to spice up your GURPS game. There is one problem though: There is not enough room in a 128 page book to cover the breadth of the cyberpunk genre. While providing an excellent introduction to cyberpunk roleplaying, it does not have the depth of other supplements. If one really wants good cyberpunk in GURPS, buy Cyberworld with this one."
2,Stale!,"I order my Clif bars on Subscribe & Save 'cause I have one every day & love them, BUT . . . just received 24 completely stale bars! I would give this shipment a 1-star rating (or 0 if that's a choice), but averaged in my love of Clif bars when they're fresh."
1,no good,"got this as a gift from my baby registry and the color is WAY off. Should be sage, but it's more like a lime green! Also, it' isn't a warm enough suit, it's a cheap sot thing from China with no substance."
2,Stale Laboratory Manual,"Arrived on time but the manual was ready for the trash. Pages loose, friable and brown. You have to handle this manual with care when paging through the book. This was not the quality I expected and should have been throw in the waste been. Lables and tags still cover the front pages and spines that were difficult to remove. The rating is correct - I don't like it!"
4,Warm and comfy,I had my doubts when we first used it b/c it closes with just some toggle-like buttons and i was worried that the wind would slip through. But my baby comes out of this stroller-sleeping-bag/wrap warm every time. And we've had a few days this winter here in the Northeast that have been way below freezing with a wind chill strong enough to sting your face.
5,Best!,"This is better then any blanket in the winter. I've gotten cold but it warmed my heart that the baby was warm. It's also good for at least two years, so its a great investment."
3,Mixed reviews,"My eight year old daughter loved this book. It has excitement, adventure and we live in the area being written about. I assigned this book as a home school reading project. As a teacher, I felt the book was not well written. The characters were flat, and never developed. Still, the local history parts were interesting. The book is worth a look."
1,Put my class to sleep,"I bought this DVD to introduce my Art I high school students to the work of Alberto Giacommetti before we created a project emulating his sculpture. I am so sorry to say that although the DVD does tell about his life and his work, it was horribly BORING...even for me! I will not be showing this DVD in class again.I'm also afraid that many of the DVDs featured in the Artists of the 20th Century series are not top-notch productions. Do yourself a favor and skip them all."
4,Once upon a time the monochrome set...,"You enjoyed ""tommorow will be too long""(in fact ""strange boutique""&""Love zombies""). Well, it's time for you to buy their third album,unfortunatly the last one with genious guitarist Lester Square (some people play accoustic guitar, some others play électric guitar, and Lester Square play intelligent guitar) but be glad, one more release as good as the others 's waiting for you, rendez-vous at ""Volume, contrast, brillance""..."
3,"Sweet Story, False Facts","A Pony For Heather is a sweet story, but the author is obviously not very knowledgeable about horses. First of all, it was kind of odd how Heather and her father just went to an auction without a horse trailer, halter, or leadrope. I wasn't crazy about the illustrations, either. The ponies all looked like a cross between a Beanie Baby and a dragon. Apple, Heather's pony, actually had facial expressions! When two girls insulted Apple he frowned, and when Heather was patting or riding him, he smiled. It was cute, but sort of weird.Not counting the inacuracy of the horse facts and illustrations, it was a very cute book. Girls between six and ten would love it. Of course, for a little girl who is truly horse crazy and knows a lot about ponies already, I would reccomend a series like Bonnie Bryant's Pony Tails. They are full of accurate horse facts."
2,"Tod Browning, Where Are You?","Exploitation meister David Friedman was an expert at churning out low-budget skin-flicks and drive-in masterpieces. ""She Freak"" has been restored in clear detail and colors and you can see for yourself that Friedman blatantly ripped off Tod Browning's 1931 masterpiece, ""Freaks."" The movie starts out with promise, giving us glimpses of a real-life carnival, circa l967. But after awhile, it becomes boring. There's no skin shown, no soft-core sex, no violence and no suspense. There's even a scene taken literally from the ending of ""Freaks"" in which the devious heroine is transformed into a monster--bad make-up and all."
3,Entertaining rip off of Tod Browning's classic 'Freaks',"Not in the same category as the classic 'Freaks'but I enjoyed 'She Freak',just in a different way.The carnival atmosphere of 1967 goes a long way since there really aren't freaks or monsters till the last 30 seconds of the movie,then you get one freak in total.Atmosphere is key here.Don't be alarmed by the cheap looking cover art,[cheezy flicks]the picture quality is actually good for being the low-budget schlockfest that it is. Look out for the fantastic ending that is in those something weird video openings(the reason I had to own this in the first place).Keep your expectations low(I mean LOW!!!!!)and you will love this crap just as much as I did.Great piece for the cheezy movie library.Really I mean it,I'm being honestly sincere.Now pass the cheeze Louweez right into your shopping cart.Then when you get home have a candle light dinner with the 'She Freak'"
3,Ok,"Bad rip off of the original Freaks movie. If you like bad, B rate movies, this ain't to bad. Otherwise.. you probably won't enjoy it at all."
4,Fun Trashy Flick,"I didn't expect much from this movie, but it turned out to be one of my new favorite trashy flicks, a small town diner waitress with big dreams and high hopes joins the carnival when it comes to town and tangles herself up in a web of greed and ambition she can't escape from. This film is remarkably captivating for a no budget flick from 1967, the dialog and acting are atrocious, but it's paced well and not unlike the freaks themselves, you just can't look away. For fans of ""Bad"" and ""So Bad It's Good"" cinema this is a real gem, for fans of whatever the latest big budget hollywood drivel churned out is this week is, this is not for you."
5,Good Stuff,An ex girlfriend of mine bought this for me a few years ago and every woman I've ever dated since then had complimented me on the scent. Buying it on Amazon was 40% less than in the store and it arrived on time and undamaged. Good deal and good results.
4,A very sad but true story,This movie was well written and it had a great deal of the human nature that we all deal with in our lives.
5,Its a true event,I got this and watched it. You never know about people these day's do you. It's sad that this is a true story. If you like movies about really crime or really events that have happened watch this
4,For the Love of Emma by Lucy Gordon (Large Print Harlequin),"Description from the book back cover:Carlyle Brackman was Briony's boss - and what an ogre! Then she saw him in another light - as a tender, devoted father. It was a transformation that almost melted Briony's heart - almost made her agree to Carlyle's request: marry him and be a mother to Emma ... now that Emma had only months to live. Maybe Briony could accept that Carlyle didn't love her. But could she ever forget the pain of losing her little sister so suddenly and cruelly ... for Emma's sake?"
4,Very Nice!!,"This knife was expensive, but it is very nice!! I'm trying to collect all of the Pro ""S"" series knives."
3,Flawed by virtue of being unbalanced,"There's little difference between this and the Wusthof Classic Hollow Santoku except that the Henckels Twin Pro S is unbalanced, meaning, when you relax your grip, the knife wants to tip out of your hand onto its point. Otherwise, it's great. But that flaw is an annoyance too great to tolerate when you're working with a knife all day in the kitchen. Therefore I gave this as a gift to a college kid rather than keep it."
4,DMI Ft250DS,"it took us 3 hrs to build the table. the instruction booklet was not very clear. we had to figure the players out by looking at the actual picture. there are dead spots on all 4 corners.however, the table looks great and the weight is about right. nice and heavy."
4,Dope-alicious,This album has a lot of beats and such as Outkast- and Killer Mike can throw it dizzown with his rhymes...
4,Another Dope Emcee Out Of Atlanta,"I heard Killer Mike for the first time on Outkast's Snappin & Trappin and he has been murdering tracks ever since(i.e. The Whole World). I had high expectations going into this album and he does not disappoint at all. My highlights are Ak-shon(Killer Mike rides this beat well), A.D.I.D.A.S.(more lyricism and one of the album's dopest beats), All 4 U(this track features a dope vocal sample and the beat is probably the best on the album), Dragon(poignant track about a deceased friend), Rap Is Dead(this track addresses the current state of hip-hop) and RE:Ak-shon(I keep this track on repeat; Killer Mike, Bun-B and T.I. all rip this song to shreds)Overall, Killer Mike has dropped one of the best debut albums that I have heard in a while with Monster. I was looking for substance and flow combined with solid production throughout and I got it with this album. I predict that this will be one of the top five hip-hop albums released this year."
3,Good Album,"I will now review each track on cd.1) Monster (Intro)-Just an intro.2)Moster-Ok song.3) Akshon! (Yeah) F/ Dre 3000-first single, good track.4) Rap Is Dead- Not great.5) Scared Straight- Amazing track, I hope it is his next single off the album, if he has one.6) All 4 U (Niecy's Song)- Not Bad.7) A.D.I.D.A.S. F/ Big Boi,Sleepy Brown-AMAZING SONG< I LOVEE IT!8) Creep Show F/ Bizarre OF d12- Great tune.9) U know I love you F/ J-Sweet-Ok.10) Home of the brave F/ Slimm Calhoun-GREAT ATL SONG!11) L.I.V.E.- Very good song.12) Blow (Get Down) F/ Rock-D-Good tune.13) Sex, Drugs, Rap, & Roll-Pretty straight forward.14) Dragon F/ Fass Black- Very good.15) Re-Akshon (Akshon Remix) F/ T.I.,Bun B of U.G.K.,and Bone Crusher- Great verse by T.I. Amazing song.16) ???-Hidden Track-ok.Greatest songs on album:A.D.I.D.A.S.,Re-Akshon,Akshon,Creep Show,Scared Straight,Home Of The Brave.Worst songs on album:Rap Is Dead,All 4 U,U Know I Love U,and Sex,Drugs,Rap,Roll."
4,No Cookie Monster Here,"Killer Mike's ""Monster"" is the second release from the Aquemini lable. Earth Tone 3 production and Killer's own distinctive flow makes for one refreshing journey. The first half of the album is blazing with hits like ""Akshon"" and ""A.D.I.D.A.S."" Hip Hop fans of all kind will fall in love with the ghetto influenced ""Nicey's Song,"" which finds Killer paying homage to those lost in the perils of society. Killer also takes out time from his verbal rampage to voice his displeasment of the current state of Hip Hop on ""Rap is Dead."" However the album begins to falter with the Bizzare from D12 featured ""Creep Show"" and Earth Tone 3 also begin to show signs of inexperience in production with ""Live."" Still Killer's debut maintains a pleasing vibe that is both different and entertaining."
2,Talent is there but album is a HUGE disappointment,"Killer Mike is a talented MC no doubt. I was just expecting more, the beats all sound too similar. Almost like a cd single with a gang of remixes of the same song. the standout track is #8 with Bizaare from D12...BANGIN' song, too bad the album is too damn inconsistant."
2,"Boring, dull","The cover looked pretty decent, depicting a ripped Trick Or treats bag with something bloody scratching its way out. It is a total yawn fest with only ""scratch your head"" cameos by the Names (Steve Railsback, David Carradine, Peter Jason, Carrie Snodgress) to give it interest. Seems the director came out of the Al Adamson school, it shows.A baby sitter is stuck watching over a young brat on Halloween night who keeps playing vicious pranks on her. To add to her trouble the boy's deranged father has escaped from an asylum and is planning on making a visit.The tape box says this mess of a film runs 90 minutes, but the film really only runs 75 minutes. And even then you can feel the padding."
3,Like a double-length episode of the original series,"As ""Mission to Horatius"" was the very first Star Trek ""tie-in"" novel, this sturdy little hardback reprint is worth checking out for historical interest alone. But if you cut it a bit of slack and forgive some of the overly broad plotting and comedy, it actually does a fair job of providing a few hours of genuine entertainment. It certainly delivers the flavor of the original show, before countless Trek novels had added layers of subtle characterization and other levels of sophistication to the original mythos. Not that those latter improvements are bad, but it was nice to read a story that, aside from the longer length, felt just like an original Trek episode. Fun, and worth seeking out."
4,"Yes, It's Kids Book, But.............","When I saw that this book was again in print I had a feeling of both gladness and nostalgia. I still have my original copy purchased many years ago. I agree with one other reviewer who stated that the author must have been in the military as it surely does show in this book. And if you stop to think about it, the idea of cloning as far as a science fiction topic has been around a lot longer than some realize as this work clearly shows. This work also presents some very ""adult"" ideas. One of it's very obvious messages is the ugliness of political divisivness combined with a statement aganst racial oppresion. If this is ""only"" a kid's book then I am glad that I as a kid read (and enjoyed) it and would like my kids (and now my grandkids) to read it as well. Lessons about moral courage and being true to one's convictions are sorely needed and this work presents these ideals very well."
5,Still amazing after all these years,"I first encountered the book whilst away at a summer camp. That camp insisted upon tutoring each camper in whatever subject they had difficulty in. In my case it was the usual crowd. They had an excellent lending library. I worked my way through the entire Tom Swift Jr series, (all 31 available then, 32 does exist someplace.) then found this one. It was published by one of the other outlets that the original publisher owned. And naturally it is a YA book. But it reads well, still, still conveys the same message that Star Trek presented us with.The ""Enterprise moment"" that was typically around the middle of the hour shows up, in the middle of the book, about the time they found the third of the three problematic planets.It has all the kick of a Phaser set on heavy stun."
3,Simplistic fun,A fun read for younger fans and nostalgia buffs alike. It's exciting that the very first Trek book is available again.
3,This one takes you all the way back!,"You can't get any more classic Trek than this. I read it for the first time over 32 years ago at the age of ten. Back then I thought it was thrilling but as I reread it last night (I read a lot faster than I used to) I found it to be refreshingly simple. Not a lot of tecnobabble (sp) just a typical Star Trek story complete with morals even an ten year old can fail to grasp. Mission to Horatius is far from the best Trek book you will ever read, but if you loved the show as a child this book can take back in time. After all, when was the last time you read a book with pictures in it."
5,Back again after all these years...,"This is a reprint of the very first Star Trek book I ever bought, and it thrills me to see it back in print. I was about 11 when I bought the book and was mezmerized by the story. It is a wonderfully worthwhile book, worth reading at any age. Let it do for you what it did for me, which was take me into space for the first time and kept me going back for more. The only thing that would've made the book better is if there had been more of them."
2,It's a collectors item.........,"but only because it is so hard to find. Got mine for $100 off eBay. It's in pretty damn good shape........On the other hand, if you're a big fan than you already have Decade of Decadence on CD and video, so you've already seen 90% of the pictures this book contains.The Biography portion is VERY POORLY WRITTEN;I think this thing was a limited product for this very reason.If you dont already own the above mentioned CD and VHS, that would be your first stop. Those should satisfy U for awhile."
4,Pappano vs. the best,"The CG ""Figaro"" is one of the better ones on video. I think it holds up to Glyndebourne 1 (women great/men not so good) or Glyndebourne 2 (Fleming/Finlay). I don't care much for Schrott's delivery of Figaro's act four aria, however. Toni Bernhard likes the Gardiner, but to me, only Terfel shines.If the one from the Met ever makes an appearance, Terfel, Fleming & Bartoli will make that one the live performance to get. If You don't have to have a live performance, then get the DG Unitel. Prey, Te Kanawa & Freni put this one at the top."
2,The Jewel Essential Live Songbook problem,This DVD does not have audio on either my TV DVD player or my computer. I was very disappointed. Could I get a replacementthat plays the songs I want to Hear?
3,Anything but the real thing..,"2 DVD, one with lots of boring songs and Jewel interpretation that's not was you are used to listen to, with her talking during music instead of signing and she sing like she took some relaxing pills. I skipped many songs.The other dvd is better but it's short and the same songs but similar to the audio CD in performance.My advice..I'm not satisfied, if you like jewel buy the CD instead."
2,Dissapointing,I expected more hits on here. I had to listen to 5 songs before I heard one that Id heard before. Maybe Im just not a big Jewel fan but I found this concert boring.
5,I wish June Thomas would have stayed 1 more year at MSU,"GREAT book, very informative, I only wish Dr. Thomas had stayed on faculty at MSU for 1 more year so I could have taken her class on this subject. Those Wolverines don't know how lucky they have it."
3,beware of shipping costs on this item.,"ANTOnline has lowest price but exorbitant shipping costs - $16.00?Bottom line, check delivered price before you order."
5,I agree with every1!,I agree with every1 about this CD. I am a Jap. cartoons' fanatic! I like the cardcaptors CD 2 ! check it out!ADULT_SWIM_FAN - A.K.A. - ~*STAR*~
5,Tenchi Music,"I think this is a very good cd to buy if your a Tenchi fan or you just like Anime. I have found out that everybody Likes I'm a Pioneer,Lonely Moon,Talent For Love,Magical Girl Pretty Sammy, and Up Walk in the Galaxy, Your Hiroshi and Money No More is kinda annoying tho. Washu's Lullaby is my favorite tho because Washu is so cute. There is only one instrumental and that is Ryo-Ohki's theme. I personally think only 2 songs 'bite' but the others are good. So if you like Anime music go and purchase this cd it's worth it."
4,best tenchi cd ever!,i personally thought this was the best tenchi cd mainly because it has all the songs that most people like except for ayeka's theme. i gave this cd a 4 star rating. over all this was a very good cd and i reccomend this one to people who like tenchi and company.
4,Tenchi Muyo!,"Okay, i ordered this cd a few days ago, and I have to say that it's exceptional! I've got a lot of the songs in their japanese versions, and they sound alike, probably sung by the acyual actors...well duh. I love I Am A Pioneer, Magical Girl Pretty Sammi, and Dimensions of Love; they're just really great songs. I reccomend this cd for all anime fans!"
4,hmmm pretty good,"okay, this was definately a ""tenchi cd"" and anyone who is a big fan just has to buy this! i loved all the songs except for ""your hiroshi"" and ""forevermore"" because those are so boring. the rest is wonderful though! my favorite is ""pretty sammy magical girl"" because it is so cute! i love ""talent for love"" because when you hear it you feel like theres a million butterflys fluttering in you!! seriously it is so energizing... also ""up wall in galaxy"" is about my personal favorite characters fueding which is hilarius!i encourage you to buy this you will have it constantly in rotation on your cd player. sooo typically tenchi you gotta love it!"
2,Sorry TNA freaks,"TNA may have some very good matches from time to time, but in the big picture they're really quite bush league and will never overtake WWE not even on the E's worst day. AJ Styles may be exciting to watch but he's basically just a spot-fest ala Jeff Hardy and will probably be technically crippled like Hardy if he doesn't alter his style. Two best reasons to watch TNA are Chris Daniels and Samoa Joe. They are the best wrestlers in the company but even they can't help TNA against WWE. Sorry fellas"
5,Best Wrestling dvd ever made!,"This is just an awesome collection of awesome matches put on by an awesome preformer.Dont let the name D'lo brown fool you he is much better in TNA and shows it in an awesome match vs. AJTNA incase you are wondering is just what TNA stands for Total Nonstop Action.TNA is less talk, more action, better action, all the time.This is a DVD every wrestling Fan MUST have. AJ's 12 greatest matches, his comments on his life and the buisness.This dvd is a keeper. wait untill they come out in walmart this october.Keep up the 5 star preformances TNA !"
1,Overrated,"If you want to see the most overrated superstar going today, then this is the dvd for you. I don't know how many people claim that he's the most talented, but they are a lot, and they are all wrong. He's a spot fest wrestler with no sense of in ring psychology. If you want the best wrestling dvd get Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story. It has a great documentary about the best wrestler ever, and has tons of great matches. AJ isn't pheonomenal, he's subpar!"
2,This Isn't The Best I've Seen Of AJ Styles,"The problem is that this was a DVD that was released in the early days of TNA (Nashville with the regular ring) and then re-released a few months ago with no updates on it. This isn't the best AJ Styles matches as alot of the matches had outside interference & had AJ as a heel tryin' to get people to boo him instead of him doing what has made him standout today. Basically if you want the best of AJ Styles in ""current"" TNA...check out the X division DVD. There are some good matches on here but overall, this AJ Styles DVD just didn't interest me."
5,Fun and makes you sweat,"Great exerceise video. It is very unique, so my attention is kept the entire time, and the moves are very calisthenic oriented. I use a step intead of the balance trainer, and I have to fight to keep up in the end because of the endurance of the moves. She is not offbeat to me, but I do have good rhythm.I always have a smile on my face doing this workout, so I give it a 5. My other workouts I like by the FIRM are 500 Calorie Explosion, and Ultimate Calorie Blaster for the Transfirmer series. These 3 are my top favorites so far, and I alternate Yoga Booty Ballet when my back gets out of wack from some of these more intense workout videos."
1,The positive reviews were clearly by the promoters,"Like the Crazy Frog or anything based one a one-joke innovation, this is great for about 5 seconds. After that it's irritating and worse than childish.Save your money and give to charity instead. This is needless wasteful trash with little to no short/long-term appeal. Anyone saying different is selling you something. Most probably this collection of SHOCKING AURAL ASSAULT."
5,Fast shipping.,Great roller sleeves! I use these for most of my painting needs and love them and the price was right.
2,Missing pages,While the book appeared fine it was missing more than twenty pages. The missing pages were tables needed to complete homework. We didn't find the problem until it was too late.
1,American Indian Christmas by Jana,American Indian Christmas. The production was horrible. In the background you could easily hear popping and cracking sounds. It sounded like it was recorded off an old vinyl record. It was very distracting. I'm very dissappointed.
5,Amazing,"Just amazing. Her voice is incredible. The songs are so familiar to everyone that not knowing the language doesn't matter. Stand out sonsg for me... ""What Child is this"" and ""Oh Holy Night"""
5,"Interesting, informative material","Lots of info on the nuts and bolts of working with wire. The topics are well ordered, the photos clear and outstanding, step-by-step instruction. Would recommend very highly."
5,The Best Bead and Wire Book Ever,This is the book that got me started on beading. I checked it out from the library and then I was hooked and I had to have my own copy! If you don't want to do heavy metal work - you can still make fantastic jewelry with this guide. A must have for a beginner and a great reference for the rest. I've looked at MANY books (at least 50-60 so far) and this is my Very Favorite!
4,Interesting and useful,"This book is very user friendly, with lots of photos of all the steps you need to complete the proyects shown. I think it is a good book for anyone interested in learning beaded jewelry."
4,Looks Great!,I recently purchased this book as a gift for my friend's daughter.My kids and I were so intrigued by it that I may end up getting another one for us!It looks great for technique and has a good selection of projects catagorised from beginner to advanced.I may get her another that has a more extensive project selection to go with it.
5,Bead On A Wire: Making Handcrafted Wire and Beaded Jewelry,"The book was very helpful on learning the techniques of cleaning and preparing the wire you use to make jewelry. Also,I enjoyed learning how to bend wire to create some very interesting designs to make jewelry pieces. The photos were helpful when teaching the steps to bending the wire into creative new pieces for your jewelry. I would place this book in intermediate."
5,The BEST bead and wirework book ever!,"I just received this book today and am overwhelmingly pleased with this book! The first part of the book gives highly detailed tutorials on making different kinds of findings and wrapped beads. The second part of the book are wonderfully imaginative and beautiful projects - not the same old wire jig scrolls you see in many other wire jewelry books! I especially liked the brooch techniques - just fabulous!This is now my absolute favorite book, making most of my other wire jewelry books obsolete! If you can buy only one book, buy this one! It's worth much more than the cover price! Thank you, Sharilyn!"
4,Very Instructive,"There are step by step projects with very helpful pictures. You won't get started right away unless you have numerous supplies on hand, but she does help you know where to find them. Some of the examples and projects were a bit ""homemade"" looking for my own personal taste. We were able to complete several of the projects without much difficulty."
4,Lots of drawings for illistration...,I need to learn how to do wire wrapping & this is really good due to the illistrations & information on how to start doing wire wrapping.
5,Bead on a Wire,This is a beautiful book with very clear instructions and wonderful illustrations. I look forward to making many of these lovely items.Bead on a Wire: Making Handcrafted Wire and Beaded Jewelry
5,wearable popular styles,Great book showing detailed instructions of bead and wire techniques. Many books show work with wire that are interesting but I personaly would not wear because they look too ....? Styles in this book are wearable. If your intrested in wearable popular styles buy this book. Or don't so I can sell more......
5,The best I've read.,I have read several jewelry books and this is the best I've come across. I am a novice jewelry maker and am proud of what I've made with the help of this book.
5,Pretty best way to start Jewelry crafts,"To a jewel crafting beginner it opens the doors and teaches the techniques in the most comprehensive way possible. No project included in the ""Bead on a Wire"" left me with a question. This book made me so happy enabling me, a novice to jewel craft, to work with wire and beaded Jewelry right away. Sharilyn Miller is a very talented teacher."
1,Simply a rant,"It is difficult to respect the opinion of a man like Scott Taylor who in his entire military career rose no higher than the rank of Private. His ""professional"" opinion of the inner world that exists in the command structure of the Canadian forces is simply invalid."
2,Ho Hum kinda book,"Meanne runs away from her impending arranged marriage. She goes to her childhood cottage that has been long since forgotten and starts her new life there. Wisp comes into her life like a breeze. Together they make a team and strive for new beginnings.This book was rather boring. Meanne is very hurried character, as she we don't get to see inside her, just what is on her mind NOW. There was too many foreshadowing that actually lets us know what is going to happen. There is no surprise and there is no climax of the story.Its pretty mellow, a very short read of 94 pages. I honestly kept myself reading, but found myself skimming the pages. I really don't recommend this book, the only McCaffrey story so far that I didn't like."
2,"You need not agree with me, buuuuut...","About the only thing I liked about the book was that it was visually pleasing. Huh, what a thing to say! It's about the size of a CD case, irregular for a book, and it has the most beautiful cover artwork... but about the book! The story wasn't up to snuff, and I'd say the same thing about any other book of the same caliber, I don't care who wrote it. The plot wasn't particularly exciting, and the romance (could it be called that?), well, it fizzled. The characters weren't very endearing (the main girl character, Meanne, seemed like such a wilted flower. I kept wishing she'd just grow some SPINE!) and although there was magic involved, it wasn't enough to keep me interested for long. I think I'll just stick with reading the Pern books; they're longer and I actually liked the characters."
1,CRAP!!!,Opened it straight out of the box... And doesnt pump any fluid.... Waste of money DONT BUY!!Its just gets me mad because i really needed this but i guess i cant use it
3,"Cough Cool, Fog Machine","This fog machine from ""Tedro-technics"" is mainly used by the film industry to create the special effect of smog and smoke. Used in films that are intended to portray Los Angeles, and other polluted cities, one only needs a few of these to create the effect inside a well ventilated studio. Can also be used at kid's birthday parties and at dumb Halloween shows, comes with non-toxic smog packs that smell like a cross between rotten eggs and the food at Denny's."
1,BAD EXPERIENCE,"I ordered this fog machine for my neices birthday party. I thought a fog machine was a cool idea. I received a used, rusted out machine that did not work! A big disappointment."
2,Sadly Disappointed,"I thought these History Pockets would compliment our homeschool well. I was wrong. They are good for bursts of information, but we found them to be busy work, dull and redundant to our learning.I would not recommended them to fellow homeschoolers."
3,Just OK,"I teach 5th grade and I used this last fall. You definitely would be lacking if this was the only thing you did for an explorers unit. I did not use it ""pocket"" style for that reason, but did use some of the information and activities to supplement my unit. The information about the explorers is good, but some of the activities are a little silly and don't really support their learning well."
1,Powerful ? Not quite ...,"The product description says ""dual halogen light bulbs shine powerful beams of light on your grill surface and the food"". First and foremost, the bulbs hardly seem lile halogen bulbs. They look more like LED lights. This product hardly emits enough light to be even partially useful. I compared the light output to a flashlight that I picked up for $2.00 at the local hardware store. The flashlight wins, hands down. I would hardly describe the light output as ""powerful"". This product was hardly worth the money I spent on it."
5,Great flag!,"The law for Florida boaters says that you must have a 20x24"" dive flag with stiffener if anyone is in the water. This flag meets those requirements and is at a great price. A flag just like this at a dive shop would go for $30 that's 3x's the price of this flag.It's high quality it will last a long time.I am very happy with this flag!"
1,very disappointed,"very disappointed for several reasons:1) PRICE - I had hoped that by buying the case, the total price plus shipping would be less than what I found in the store, never mind adding in the price of gas to get to the store.2) The ""enlarged"" picture was only the same size picture in a larger space.3) You couldn't rotate the picture to see the exact nutritional listings, the very reason you would be buying this in the first place.4) Very few of the products were offered in the newer plastic bottles, which are much more handy if you only want 4 oz. at a time. The other 4 oz. could easily spill or even spoil.5) The new chocolate flavor in the glucose control isn't available here.Sorry, but no sale here. And yes, I'm WAY over the age of 13."
2,"arizona myths, fallacies and misconceptions","I was disappointed with the amount of irrelevant information about Arizona. It elaborates about rumors, gossips, and legends. Why would anybody spend so much time to discredit harmless and meaningless rumors? I found almost no significant information that I was looking for about Arizona for somebody who would like to move there. Don't spend time and the money for this book unless you want to entertain people during social gatherings."
2,"Not the Best - no grease, sticky pads come off","I have not yet installed these pedals, as I am waiting for a response from the seller Niagra cycle works.They don't have reflectors, although there is a place for them, and the bearings seem to be dry at best, and feel like they are bad (rough with spots?).I hope they respond, as I like the pedal design, with the circles being the no-slip material."
4,This Marine Unit was there also,"While I found the book to be very factual and informative and, without a doubt, from my Marine perspective, at times very painful, I was very dismayed to find no reference at all to 3rd Batallion, 4th Marines, that was also in the hills of Khe Sanh. Near the end of the seige, my unit, Lima Company, 3rd Batallion, 4th Marines, occupied and lost Marines on Hill 689. We also helped the Army on Hill 552 when they were getting hit in March, 1968. That being said, despite this oversight, it is a very good book and a must read for those who desire to have a ground level view of that major battle. I was also medevaced to the U.S.S. Repose, ending my time there before my unit returned to Dong Ha. Semper Fi Jim R., Sr."
3,Good effort to dispell public myths about the horrible battle.,I like this type of book for its honest effort to right the wrong historical information. What i had trouble following because of the way the story is constructed is any time line. Also a map in the book would be very helpful. I have a good friend who survived one of those hills and another who was on the perimeter of the base but they can't even explain what went on; I can forgive them. Keep writing./dc
4,A wonderful book,"This was a great book, about a girl who lives with her grandmother, aunts, and her great aunts. At her grandmother's house tea is served promptly at four o'clock, along with storytime. Everybody has a story at grandmother's house, with a begining, middle, and an end: except Grayling her story doesn't have an end, that she (or any one else for that matter) knows of. Grayling's story is lived as you read this book. This book has everything: family, friendship, and love. This was a great book that all of my friends and I have loved for years, and we all recomend it to you."
3,"If you haven't seen these films, you're not a film buff","In all honesty, I'm not a movie fantatic, but to imply one hasn't seen these 4 star films is rather problematic. I'm not quite sure who these people are--who haven't seen these films--that the writer has in mind. I've seen about all of these films; some are good, some not so good. The commentary is ok, but not on a par with informed film critics. Well, I guess if you haven't read much, you might have a book called ""Great Books You've Never Read,"" and perhaps ""1984"" would be among them, but that tells us more about the assumptions of the writer than the audience."
1,not a quality item,"I was not impressed with the quality of the connections when assembling.There is no carrying strap. I assume you move it around by the ""plastic"" handle you use to pump up pressure. There are no rubber seals so you must turn out with gusto ,otherwise it will leak when pressurized.Also after pressurized ,when you're done again it takes a hard twist to remove.The spray nozzle is again plastic and does not have a super fine spray. I am afraid I will snap off the handle.I am not happy and will probably return."
5,Duro med rocker bottom cast shoe,"This shoe is quite durable. It fits all of my casts. Some of my casts have been larger than others, so when I need a longer strap to go over the top of the foot I just add velcro strips for length, and then the shoe remains perfectly suited for my uses. It gets heavy use and doesn't break down. I garden and get the shoe muddy so I have put them through the washing machine and air dried them with no mishaps to the shoe shape or construction. I am a very active person and have found no problems with keeping the shoe on while continuing my activities. This is the second one I have gotten. Casts can be hard to walk in, but with the rocker bottom from Duro Med I am not having much of a problem. I get a new cast every week so the shoe has to be versatile enough to fit them all. It is. It is a wonderful shoe and I highly reccommend it to anyone needing to make a cast more user friendly."
2,Pretty Tame Stuff,"Disappointing. Just some scantily clad girls rolling around on an apartment floor pretending to wrestle, but with no skill or effort. When one spanks the other, the blows seem to be done in slow motion. All the matches are identical in that they are all just dull. The picture on the ad seems to portray a couple of pro girl wrestlers from the 50s, but they are not in this one."
5,Applied Phonetics Workbook,"The book and CDs arrived in ""new"" condition as advertised, even though I purchased them as used, saving about $20. I was thrilled!"
3,An American Profit,"Joseph Smith includes a little bit of everything he was ever exposed to in this fascinating stew (Masonic influence is clear) and cooked-up a uniquely American religion. This is a must for students of American society and history. Smith took the simplest of home-grown, half-baked ideas and turned it into a business. An amazing man and an amazing story that could only happen here."
1,Absurd!,"While reading this book, I was just totally amazed at how absurd and silly it is. What Mormons are trying to do is to re-invent history. As a person with a degree in history, I can't believe this. This religion is saying that the American Indians came from Israel. Sorry! Wrong! North American Indians migrated from what is now Asia, across the Bering Strait, down through Alaska and Canada and into what is now the United States, Mexico, Central and South America. There is nothing in the history of these peoples that would indicate in any way what the Mormon church is trying to teach. I am at a loss to understand where this religion gets off saying that this book goes hand in hand with the Bible. I have read both and it certainly does not. I pity these poor people who have been deceived by this cult. Not only is it totally absurd reading, but some of the writing reminds me of the Monty Pyton And the Holy Grail movie during the ""Holy Hand Grenade"" speech. Jeesh!"
1,this is more fiction that a book of religion,"I, as an active Christian have read this book and I have found it loaded with contradiction and lies that are repeated over and over. I also find it hard to believe that a so - called relion that worships the living GOD would put this first and above the Holy Bible. Anyone that is thinking of reading this book should have a good BIBLE with them so that they can do their own comparison."
1,Problems with the Book of Mormon,"I have been reading the book of mormon, pearl of great price, and doctrine and covenants as well as teachings of the prophet joseph smith. Joseph Smith said that the BOM was the most correct book on earth and that it was given to him directly from God. However three editions and 3912+ changes later is a lousy batting average for the most correct book on earth that was given directly from God.Not to mention extensive plagerism of the KJV Bible which didn't even exist when the BOM was supposedly origionally penned in between 600 B.C. and A.D. 421. From this and other problems one could conclude that the BOM is the most incorrect book ever written and is not given from God because God is Truth and no error is of the truth. As far as compatability with the Bible there isn't any. The BOM teaches that one must earn salvation but the Bible teaches that salvation is a free gift recieved through faith in Jesus Christ. READER BEWARE! All challenges welcome!!!!"
5,Provocation and substance,"I wasn't sure about Stalk's thesis here but looked forward to the book based on his granite reputation. Last thing we need is more empty admonitions about the Relentless Pursuit of Whatever. Gratefully, this is a fine book. Its power is not just its viewpoint, but the practical substance that backs it up. You will plan, decide, and act more successfully having read this--which is the only real reason to read a business book."
1,Don't judge this book by the good looking cover,"A really bad book. Parts about Wal-Mart strategy are not correct.A typical sentence:(On CarMax) ""Traditional dealers break even or lose money on the sale of new vehicles, making most of their money on new car sales (about 75% of profits), service (40% percent of profits) and finance and insurance (30% percent of profits)."" That adds up to 145%.etc, etc."
4,Machiavellian Hardball,"""Hardball"" is about doing what's in your best interest according to the conditions of the situation. ""Hardball"" is a metaphor for playing in the big leagues with a ""winner take all"" philosophy. What's excellent about the book is while taking a Machiavellian approach to doing what is necessary for the situation, it does not advocate bloodletting for the sake of shedding blood. If anything, it warns against it. A wounded animal could be at its most dangerous. But, like Machiavelli's, The Prince, one could assert that if your opponent declares war on you, all means for winning should be at your disposal. An excellent book to read in conjunction with ""Monopoly Rules: How to Find, Capture and Control the Most Lucrative Markets In Any Business, by Milind M. Lele.""Edward S. Brown IIICore Edge Image & Charisma Institute, Inc."
4,Rallying Cry,"This book got me out of my comfortable chair. The case studies are compelling, the strategies are impactful and the challenge is direct. It's clear that Stalk and Lachenauer love the sport of business and want to help build some new championship teams. They have a passion for commerce, competition and excellence. Beyond the sports analogy, I felt like I was reading one of Shakespeare's great rally cries: ""Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more..."""
2,A true disappointment,"In the words of author Gertrude Stein: ""There's no 'there' there."" I was very impressed with the first third of this book and then my interest in reading it simply fell off the edge of the table.The book relies almost exclusively on anecdotal evidence to support its claims, and most examples aren't that well developed. Some conclusions are muddled or, in my view, considered ""stretches.""One of my personal pet peeves is that this book is horribly edited. It is riddled with misspelled words and other grammatical nightmares. It was horribly distracting. It seemed like they almost rushed this book to print to coincide with the article in Fast Company magazine.Even though it's only 159 pages, halfway through this book, I just couldn't wait to be done with it. I'm glad I checked it out of the library. I would have been p*ssed if I had paid $25 for it."
1,Very Weak - Lacking Substance,"What kind of fool would shell out $25 to buy a book he new he was going to detest? Uh, me. If you're impressed with platitudes, by all means read this book. It's amazing how obvious some of the recommendations are. If the authors had spent more time explaining how to know when to change strategies, rather than focusing on hindsight, this book could have been powerful. It's a shame, really. George Stalk and Rob Lachenauer have published much deeper research in HBR and other strategy journals. They wrote this book in extremely high level terms that yield almost zero insight. This book was extremely weak, basically, it just lacked substance. I definitely don't recommend this book unless you are looking for a VERY fluffy high level concepts."
1,"Old ""competition"" paradigm yields little","This book, along with reading an in-depth interview on Harvard Business On Line, displays a great deal of fear-based negative focus on so-called competition, and does not bring the reader to a higher level of success by passionately thriving in doing what they love, in cooperation with others that are in the same field.If anything, it will instill a lot of fear into a business person to focus more on their ""competition"" than on creating the best that they have to offer, for the highest benefit of all.A better alternative read would be ""How Brands Become Icons: The Principles of Cultural Branding"" By Douglas B. Holt. Also Published by HBS Press"
4,The art of repetition,"Despite having, IMO, the best swing in golf today, Ernie is not the best of golf writers. He repeats himself a lot through the book, wich makes it a bit boring. However, at the end of the book you will have a surprise - having gone through all the basics over and over again, you really assimilate some good swing thoughts that will improve your swing. Great fotos; all in all a usefull book."
3,"Great pictures, but the instruction lacking ...","I love Ernie's smooth-flowing swing. This book does not disappoint in showing that off to the fullest. However, the instructional text is very sparse and quite repetitive. He could have summarized the instruction in probably 5 pages. Overall, this cannot be used as a sole source of golf instruction. However, for swing emulation or comparison sake, it is well suited."
5,Sticky Thrip five pack,These work well in helping to eliminate pests in the greenhouse. I don't think anything will get all of the white flies but using safer insecticidal soap and the yellow strips keeps the problem under control.
3,Did not help,"It did not help my outdoor ficus. Trapped some of bugs but overall it was no help for me. I needed to get a professional who sprayed my tree. It may help gardeners with smaller infestation, I had no luck with it."
3,works - somewhat,"There is evidence of [thrip?] flies and other imponderable prisoners on the blue sticky surface; however, there is still evidence of leaf miners on the plant. mixed-bag.Delivery was prompt and as represented."
2,Did not work for me.,"I had such high hopes, but I am sorry to say TSP did not work well for me.I had been using a product called ""class magic"" to help my dishwasher work better.The glasses were, literally, squeaky clean. Everything was clean including the dishwasher.I only switched to TSP because the Glass Magic is a bit expensive.I thought I could get the same results and spend less.With in two weeks of using the TSP My glasses have a film on them and so does the wall of the dishwasher.I can feel it on the surface of my dishes and see it on my pans.I am very disappointed and a little puzzled as to why TSP has not worked well. I gave it two stars because I am thinking it works better than nothing at all."
1,TSP was exposed to moisture,"The Savogran 10622 TSP is hard as a rock because it had obviously been exposed to moisture at some point as evidenced also by water stained box. Since the box was wrapped tightly in plastic and dry when it arrived, I can only assume it did not get wet in transit. Time for a new seller."
3,Be Careful when ordering with other products,"Don't order this item with any books or anything else that could be damaged by it. Amazon placed this item in the box with 2 books I ordered and no padding or packaging materials of any type. The box for this item was damaged while shipping, and some of the powder leaked out. The books I ordered were covered with it -- there was powder between every page and everwhere you looked!!! Order this by itself only -- so it can't damage whatever else you order."
3,Savogran TSP,I'am using about 1/2 teaspoon and it seems to etch the drinking glasses. The city I live in uses alot of ground water. So it has high mineral concentrations. Still trying to find the right combination.
4,Good addition to detergent,"I wouldn't say this has cured all post-TSP problems, but it it definitely more effective than detergent and rinse aid without the TSP. I add about 2 teaspoons to the detergent I use. Dishes appear cleaner and there are less food particles sticking to things."
1,I found this book to be patronizing and completely useless.,"As an adult dyslexic diagnosed late in life looking for tools of compensatation in the work force, I found this book to be patronizing and completely useless. Although the book does have an excellent reference list of agencies you can contact, the tone and content of the book suggest an incompetence on the part of the reader which is clearly a residual attitude of past misconceptions about the disability. It implies that dyslexics are self-centered individuals not capable of even the simplest task of personal grooming or intellect. Clearly not the best book for individuals trying to understand the unique way dyslexics comprehend the world."
1,NOT Enough information,"This review is written by someone who is dyslexic. I found the book to be a total waste of time. It was nothing but an ""I'm So Sorry For Me"" book. The book gave no positive outlook for dyslexics at all. There were some helpful resources in the back (maybe). My husband also read it and found it to be severely lacking in useful information."
4,This book helped me,"I am a young adult and I discovered that I was dylslexic just recently. This book provided comfort to me, as my condition has caused much pain in my life. I made many mistakes in my childhood that could have been avoided had my condition been diagnosed. As an adult, I was accused of a serious crime that I did not do. The good news in my life is that I now know what I am fighting. This book and others like it have showed me that I am not alone in this battle and that others have faced the same obstacles."
3,Money management from a Christian perspective,"An important fact to note about the author is that he is the ""founder and president of Christian Financial Concepts, Inc., a ministry dedicated to teaching God's priniciples of financial management."" (from the back cover) This doesn't affect the quality of his advice, but it may affect whether you buy this book as gift for someone else who may be an atheist or follow a religion other than Christianity."
4,Great Product! It's worth it to upgrade.,"I currently have PSE 2.0, and downloaded 5.0 to try it out. So far, it's an excellent product and is worth the cost of upgrading. Some of the great new features (which may have been in versions 3 and 4) are the cookie cutter, frames, and THANKFULLY, strokes! I was very disappointed that 2.0 did not allow you to draw strokes around objects, but 5.0 has this. This version also gives you much more control over layer styles as well as more style, theme, and other artistic options. My only caveat to you is that you should have a lot of memory. Even with 1GB of RAM, the program can be slow to respond at times."
1,Supposed to be a good product...,"...but it's worthless if you can't use it! The product comes with next to no instructions on how to use it. I'm guessing all the rave reviews I've read are writen by people who are familiar with Photoshop and have found this to be a simpler version, but I've never used Photoshop, and would appreciate Adobe giving me a little help getting started. The ""Getting Started"" pamphlet that came with the software is so incomplete as to be useless. It's a shame, because I really need to use it, and have not gotten very far in the two weeks I've had it.The only remedy is to buy a book from a third party. That there are so many to choose from is an indication that the authors saw a market opportunity in Adobe's oversight. Some might argue the cost of the software plus a few books to help you figure out how to use it is still a good value, but Adobe should have done their job."
3,It's the standard,"I find Photoshop to be non-intuitive and a resource-hog. However, Photoshop is the standard in photo-editting and if I want to get advice from another photographer, he/she will give it in Photoshop terms so I'm forced to buy this product."
3,Advanced editing for your photos,"This may be a great soft ware item for editing your own pictures but it is very hard for me to get into more than just the basics which I can do quicker and more easily with Kodak Easy Share. I need a training course to use this properly, I'm afraid."
4,Bought the wrong photo elements version selling it on eBay.,"I used a torrent Photoshop elements version 6 and used it on occasions now when I saw Photoshop elements five I’m thinking yeah that's got to be the one I use, however I soon realized that it wasn't and basically that's on me because technically I had forgotten version of Photoshop elements I used as a torrent so now I have two sell it on eBay which is within a few short hours away. This product is very good this is before they added the quick select tool in version 6 which version 5 lacked also there are a lot of things you can do with it however you have to remember which version of Photoshop elements you used or if you have a lot of problems. I really like this product but it's not the one I'm looking for so unmotivated 4/5."
2,Forced to a Later Version,"I used Photoshop for years but lost it when my computer crashed. I bought PSE5 because I read that it was most like full PS in appearance. After I ordered it, I read that it would not work properly with Windows 7, so I did not load it on my computer. If you have anything later than VISTA, don't buy it. Makes me crazy when companies intentionally make products obsolete! You are at their mercy. Instead, I bought PSE10 and find that it is a really fine alternative to the full PS. PSE10, as well as most of the earlier versions is a perfect editing and enhancing program for most amateur or intermediate photographers with many many of the same features PS offers, and way more features than the basic editing programs provided by camera software and factory loaded programs. PSE...any version, yes!"
2,Can't keep Photoshop Album Starter Edition Away,"Have Photoshop Elements 2 and like it very much. However, almost every time you start it it says update required and it then downloads Adobe Photoshop Album- NO MATTER WHAT. No matter how often you uninstall it, it comes right back with the next suggested update.I might live with it except, I believe, that once Album works with your pictures you can't access them any more without Album. It's like Outlook Express. I may be wrong on this, but be aware of the possibility. You also get it when you update reader.I rate PSE2 2 because I can't stop the downloads of PS Album Starter Edition.I don't know if this happens with 5."
4,Adobe Photoshop,"I really haven't had time to get to experience the complete package, but what I've seen , I like."
5,Student's Program,"I am a professional photographer and teach advanced amateurs ""How to Improve Your Photos"" using Photoshop Five. I have not yet reviewed this new program as I use Photoshop CS2. I will review it ths week and be prepared to teach my class and give you a meaningful review by the end of February. Thanks for asking.Roland Hiltscher"
4,Great for digital scrapbooking and editing your photos.,"This software works great for editing your digital pictures and designing digital scrapbooks. Does have a little bit of a learning curve though, but what new software doesn't right? If you're looking to get really creative or want more versatility, I suggest the CS version. I love the guide option available in CS, but seems to be missing in Elements 5. :("
4,Nice Upgrade,"I bought this product after using an older version for a year. There are many nice upgrades and features. Even for a novice, I think this software is easy to use."
1,Stripped of essential features,"I have used Photoshop products since their inception in the late 1980s, and am disappointed and frustrated to find this version of Elements stripped of features that have been a part of all Photoshop products until now. For example, the pull-out guides that can be dragged from rulers (a feature of even the simplest graphics programs) have been eliminated, apparently to try to force users to buy the full Photoshop program. Buying the full version (as I have for years) had already been my plan until I encountered this and other arm-twisters. Now I will look elsewhere for photo editing software."
1,"Do yourself a favour, buy Paint Shop Pro instead.","I gave this product one star because the option of giving it zero doesn't exist.I moved from Elements 2.0 to this supposed 'upgrade' at a cost of over $100. For that, I lose the functionality of being able to browse a large number of files and open those I want to edit with a single click (I now have to import them into one workspace, review them, then go to another workspace to edit them),Also, a huge annoyance is the loss of the 'undo' and 'redo' icons on the toolbar, as others have mentioned.Do yourself a favour, go with PSP10 instead."
3,"One step forward, one step back",They removed the main toolbar that was present in version 4. Makes it less efficient and more time consuming.
5,New Photoshop Elements,"Bought Elements 5.0 because I have a new computer with Vista operating system, previously owned Elements 3.0. The Elements 3.0 can't run on Vista, but 5.0 can with a free download patch from Adobe. Elements is much faster on Vista, the program itself seems almost the same as 3.0."
1,Still No Fix for the Slide Show Feature,"I have always regretted upgrading to Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 (Adobe's upgrades for Elements are frequent and expensive) without checking to be sure that the Slide Show feature was fixed. I refuse to pay for support services, especially when I have just bought the product, so I've had to rely upon googling the error message (the same one occurs with version 5) and the oblique commentary under Support on the Adobe site. Sure there are improvements in version 5, but it's time consumers made Adobe get its act together. Try the trial version to be sure all the features work on your machine before buying."
4,Elements good for beginner,I'm a novice photo editor. Elements was easy to use and instantly improved my images. Lots better than the others I have tried and thus worth the money.
2,review of Photoshop Elements 5,"I have usedPhotoshop 7, and likedit.I beleive,Adobe has made the PhotoshopElements 5 unnecessarily cumbersome in termsof downloading,saving,etc."
2,Not What I expected,As the description said the CD was not boxed. Apparently it was meant as part of a software package so I don't know if it is a full version or not. I had purchased less expensive photo editing software in the past with more bells and whistles. Had heard so much about this Adobe Photo Elements that I was looking forward to having my copy. I'm not sure how much I will be using this one.
4,Pretty good program,"I used Photoshop for years before I retired. I bought this program with some doubt on its capabilities. I was surprised at all the things it can do for the price. This program is ok, except I do have some problems burning slide shows that I created with it on CDs and DVDs."
3,More than enough features,Excellent photo editing tools for almost all requirements. One missing tool is an automated system for saving multiple photos at a file size small enough for the web.
3,"Very complicated for non computer savvy people, but I have high hopes I'll figure it out","I wish the manual had more detail, so that I could figure out how to utilize the cool features without having to take a special class or purchase and read another book. Right now I'm able to use it for some features, but I rarely open the program because a couple of free programs I found online can do the main image editing that I need. Great for those who are more experienced and do more with their photography. Save your money if you're not (and just plan on using your photos for the typical uses like showing them to friends/relatives) or take the class/get more instruction. I plan on learning more though since I spent all that money on it and would like to make the most of it's features."
3,PSE 5.0 (Older Version) 2007 Dec 12,Adobe PS Elements 5.0 (older version) works nicely with XP and does function as advertised. It is worth the price.
5,"Really, with the right instruction, PSE may be an effective CS2 substitute...","I wanted to see if I could do all the essential digital image editing ""on the cheap"" in PSE5...and I am satisfied that I have been able to do just that.The best companion book I've seen to assist in that effort is this one:Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 Maximum Performance: Unleash the Hidden Performance of Elements by Mark Galer.The combination of the PSE5 software and book proved to be perfect for me, and as near as I can tell, I can now do all the image editing I need to do, at a fraction of the cost and time required for the full-on Photoshop product. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. If you're on the fence about it, I'd recommend downloading the 30 day trial version from the Adobe website prior to purchasing."
3,"Problems removing, bad tech support","I installed a trial version of this program, and found that for my needs as a photographer it wasn't much of an improvement over Elements 3, which I had resident on my computer. While the install said Elements 5 would create its own photo files, when I uninstalled the program all my photographs were assigned to another photo program trial that had expired rather than to Elements 3. I also could not use the photo editor in Elements 3 any longer. So beware if you install this program on top of an older Elements program! When I called tech support for Adobe a staffer there advised they would not help me even though Elements 5 caused the problem- because Elements 3 is no longer supported. When I asked to speak to a supervisor I was transferred to customer service in India. So beware Adobe tech support!"
3,From an amatuer,"I am still taking all the lessons I can find. The firstchore of organizing photos seems excessively cumbersome for my purposes. I have always kept my pictures in folders that are event and/or people oriented.I hope I can master the editing because it seems much more complex than ealier editions and other Photo programs I have used. It certainly has a lot of power, but it seems more than I need, and uses a lot of RAM."
1,Not the best,"I bought Adobe Elements 5.0 because I thought it had more features than Microsoft Digital Image Suite, and it probably does. Getting the Adobe software to work is the trick. I even bought two books to help me learn how to use Adobe and I still can't get it to work right. I should have stuck with Microsoft, it is much easier to use."
3,Cheaply made,"Although these are sturdy and my 10 month old son loves to ""read"" them and flip the pages himself - I feel these are cheaply made and repetitive. In the same series there are baby chick and baby ducklings and both of them have the soft yellow fur in the window. I feel like the creators ran out of imagination at some point and started to repeat themselves. The pages contain pictures of animals on white background plus a couple of words of text. These are very simple and I feel my son will outgrow them quickly.In comparison, I like the magic windows series. I feel they are much more imaginative and clever. If I had known up front - I would not have ordered these."
3,Great books but be careful,"My toddler eagerly opened and chewed on her new books only to find that our new set included 2 copies of the wild animals book, 1 farm book, and NO baby animals book. We ordered it directly from Amazon and with no listed phone numer or internet returns comment section, we feel we are stuck with this incomplete set."
5,I'm Growing Myself Back Up!,"This is the best book I have read for a long time and it's changing my life! John Lee has given everyone a gift in this book. My therapist has ordered copies to give to people because she read it after me and thinks everyone should have a copy.John's style is easy to read, easy to relate to and understand, as well as making you smile. I could identify with so much that he wrote and I loved his analogies. The story of the gazelle was timely and helped me to understand my physical responses to fear and the defence mechanisms I experience when facing some of the emotional pain of my past.I have gone on to read ""Facing the Fire"" which is another excellent read.If John ever came to the U.K. I would love to attend one of his workshops."
1,Don't bother buying this book,"Don't waste your time buying this book. They promise a cd or audio tape with the book, but didn't send it. So we returned it, and they sent it a second time, also without the cd. It is virtually impossible to learn this tonal language without a cd or tape."
1,I can't believe this,I was not happy because I never received the cd that came with the book. Someone I knew bought the same thing and they let me listen to the cd that I never received and It was not clear they did not explain anythnig just started reading and paused a lot in the cd. The moral of this story is I was very unhappy
2,Incomplete Order,"The book I recieved must have been some kind or reprint. It was not of the same quality as other books of this title have had. In addition, there was no CD with the book. This title typically comes with an associated Twi cd."
3,"Good, but you need a native speaker or audio...","I bought the book, and it is okay. For the most part it is correct. My wife is Ghanaian, and finds it very amusing when I pull out phrase from the book. [...]"
1,NOT worth the price!!!,"I bought this monitor about a year ago and just recently I went to turn on the computer and the screen went black for no reason. I am not able to get any picture back. I thought it was my CPU at first but then realized it was the monitor. This is the first time a monitor lasted less than a year. I had my previous monitor for almost 8 years! I will not buy another View Sonic or recommend one, especially after reading a previous review where the person had two go at the same time."
2,It is not as good as my expectation,"This monitor I bought has a slight yellowish hue to the overall display, no matter how hard I adjust the hardware or the gamma settings. Geeeeee, it is not my eye's problem, I am an art major and I know color well. Gonna contact the customer service to see what can be done."
5,Excellent ANALOG only LCD monitor,"I bought this 19"" LCD monitor here at a very good price which made it even more attractive. If you use Windows XP and have blurry text, go to the Microsoft's website and use its ClearType to adjust your screen (http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearType/Tuner/Step1.aspx). I only had this for about 3 weeks so I can't comment on its reliability but so far it's been superb."
2,Poor Quality,"This monitor has varying degrees of blur.There are also dark spots.Isn't ViewSonic supposed to be a reputable brand?This unit must be a fluke -- I'm returning it for a replacement.============= UPDATE =======================My replacement monitor is free of defects and is working perfectly.I am upgrading my rating from two stars to four stars.Additionally, the Amazon exchange process was convenient and fast.Thanks Amazon!"
5,LCD-monitor review,"Ordered arrived as specified, in great condition and it performs just as expected. I would buy again."
3,"Blurry text & graphics, even at recommended resolution","This monitor is a beautiful design, but the image quality just isn't as good as I expected. The text and graphics are slightly blurry...enough to cause eye strain. This could be somewhat acceptible for low-moderate use, but for long-term usage, it will not. I'm returning this, and holding off on a purchase until I can afford a better quality monitor (those that currently price out in the $800 range). The difference is definitely noticable."
1,Slow read,"The premise of this book sounded interesting - a house swap between a British couple and a North Carolina couple, neither of whom knew the other. The reading is very slow and tedious but at least the author differentiates each of the many characters in this book. In addition to the principal four people making up the 2 couples, we have kids, nannys, neighbors, bosses, secretaries and friends. That's a lot of characters. A failing marriage dissolves and a good marriage also dissolves - the ending is not very conclusive but probably realistic as the British guy, Oliver, ends up marrying the American girl Christy."
4,Long Distance Love Explored,"This is the story of a long distance relationship between two very different people which begins with a very innocent house swaping arrangement. It was very enjoyable and had at least one or two real thought provoking lines including, ""...you can't go around messing up somebody's life just because you ge the notion that you love them. No one has that right."" (page 148)A good read for the upcoming winter!"
2,Better left unread.,"The only reason I slogged through this book was to see how it would end. The idea for the storyline was good, but other than that, the book was terrible. You basically have a group of well-to-do people who are not satisfied with what they have and constantly whine and complain about it. The children acted more like adults than the adults did. If you want to read a story about discontentment and infidelity, this book's for you. Otherwise, don't bother."
5,as cute as can be,"I've got a hefty handful of grown ""boys"" on my own personal gift list who will be getting this book for Father's Day. It's a sweet, terrible, funny look at boyhood. I couldn't put it down. It's also a beautifully designed book."
4,Quick and fun to read,"This is a fun book to make you laugh and to remind you that boys do have a mischievous streak (as if you needed reminding)! The author has collected accounts of the childhood pranks of men who are now (she claims) perfectly respectable adults. There is nothing deep or thought-provoking here, but I laughed out loud many times reading this. By the way, there is no way I would give this to my boys until they have outgrown their mischievous stage! The squeamish among us may wish that the author had left out some of her collection of stories, but overall it is reading that will tickle your funny bone. I wish it had been longer."
2,Heavy boots,"And I mean heavy. I bought these for my son, but he hardly ever used them because they are so heavy! Hard to imagine that something so cumbersome is still made, given the facts that there are so many light weight boots out there, which keep one warm and dry as well. A disappointment!"
1,Crease digs into ankle,"I bought these one size up as my size was too tight. They are warm as can be and work great in the snow but creases formed around the ankle area, and bothered my right one specifically. I exchanged them for another pair thinking it was a defect. Same problem. I tried stuffing a towel in it to keep the crease out but when I wore them and walked around, it formed instantly and dug into my ankle. Even the lining followed the shape of the crease. Its too bad as they were warm and looked good. Shame."
3,SOREL MENS CARIBOU SNOW BOOTS,They were a gift to my son-in-law for Christmas. He likes them but I think they are very heavy. My daughter also has a pair and cannot wear them to drive (standard/shift)
3,"wasn't happy, but...","After 1-1/2 winters, mine are falling apart. The left sole is split from the upper and each boot has numerous small cracks in the rubber where my foot flexes. Not good for a $100 boot. They ARE very warm when my feet aren't wet. UPDATE: Sorel sent me a whole new pair and I have changed my rating to 3 stars."
1,sorel caribou boot,on second winter the rubber on sides has cracked and boots are unusable. otherwise i like them but rubber material ir rubbish .waste off money :(
4,Sorel's,"Great price, quick shipping, happy customer...just find the boots a little tight getting your feet in and out, thanks will continue shopping amazon."
4,Size Issue - Boots too large,"I just ordered some of these boots after reading reviews about them. As far as shoes go, I normally wear 12.5 or 13. I ordered these in size 12 and they are still too big. I returned them and got a pair of size 11."
2,"Not so much with Sorel, but with Amazon...","Just received my Sorel's, great looking boots...problem is that they do run big....way too big. I wear a size 9, ordered a size 9; they are like a size 10 at least. Contacted Amazon about an exchange....I would have to do a refund...which takes 10-15 days, and then find someone else who sells them. I SURE WISH I WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE STORE. I knew ordering clothes online was a bad idea."
3,My Boots,Good boot but they are on there way back not true to size run very small. I will long for something different
2,too big,"I wish these boots fit me, because they look nice and they must be very warm. However, I usually wear a size 12.5 and with these being winter boots and no half sizes available, I ordered 13. Not only do they fall very large length-wise, they were also extremely wide. My feet swam in them and because they were so wide, they looked ridiculously big. Not to mention, they're rather heavy.I sent them back to Amazon, no problem and got myself a pair of North Face winter boots with a similar rubber bottom. They are cheaper, very comfy, warm, have good grip and are very light! And although my feet are still the same size, these boots don't look half as big."
5,They were perfect.,I bought these for my husband. He absolutely loves them. They keep his feet warm and dry. He has a very wide foot and these are cut very wide. They are perfect.
3,Sorel Snow Boots not as durable as before,"I have owned and used Sorel Snow Boots for over 25 years, and consider them the best. When my last pair finally wore out, I ordered the Sorel Men's Caribou Snow Boot in Black/Tusk as a replacement. I was pleased with the initial quality and fit, but after using only one and one-half seasons, the top rubber portion of the left boot split open about 2 inches, deep enough to take in liquid. I plan to patch it back together and try to continue to use it, but am disappointed that the new Sorels do not seem to be of the same quality or have the same longevity as they used to have. Still, they are a good boot for the money as long as the liners are replaced periodically."
1,Stay away from this boot.,Sorel used to make good boots. Then they sold out to Columbia which started using cheap rubber that cracks in a few months of use. Do not waste your money on these boots. Columbia ruins everything they get their hands on.
2,not what i exspected,These boots are very nice looking boots but its not water proof an they are very uncomfortible . I bought these before going to dutch harbor for work an being on my feet all day these boots became hell for me . Blisters on blisters . I had to buy insoles for comfort an i will be buying new boots with in the coming weeks .
5,reat gift for outdoor work,My son works as a welder/ship fitter on the north coast of Washington. He works outside most of the time in cold damp weather during the winter months. We bought the the Sorel Caribou boots and a Carhartt Arctic Quilt Coverall for him as a Christmas gift. He is delighted and said that he doesn't have to wear much more (except a hoodie for welding) and keeps nice and warm without feeling overly bulky. The boots were a wonderful addition to the coveralls. He cuts his own wood as well and appreciates the dry warmth of these boots. Nice product..
5,My favorite winterboot,"It does have everything I want in a winter boot, its keeps the snow out really well and looks really good at the same time. I have looked everywhere I live for a boot like this but haven't found one. I'm really happy Sorel and Amazon could ship it all the way to europe, and so fast wow! Thank you."
4,sturdy boot...so far,"Bought these for hubby to replace a pair of North Face snow boots. The rubber by the toe literally split after only 2 years. We expected longer use, but were very disappointed in the quality. Found these Sorel boots at REI, but they didn't have the right size, so we turned to Amazon.com. They came from [...] and the delivery was faster than promised. Receipt wasn't included in the shipment, but other than that, pleased with the service. Hubby has used these in cold weather, but hasn't tried them out in snow yet. So far, he's very happy with the comfort, fit and warmth!! Colorado will be the true test..."
1,Not happy,This boot runs very big. Bought it for a gift and has to be returned--smaller size is not available. Boot is fine--transaction is a disappointment.
4,Nice boots,I used to use all leather boots but its just too hard to keep the water out. This design is very effective in the situations I am in because of the plastic at the bottom. 4 stars because it took me a while longer to break them in then i had hoped. They are well made boots.
5,Great performance in a tough New England winter,"I've been using these boots through a series of tough storms in the Boston area this year (deep snow drifts, ice, wet heavy snow, rain, you name it!) Throughout all this, these boots have kept my feet bone dry and toasty warm. Traction is great, and the fit is fine (I'm normally a 13 wide, and the 13's fit great--plenty of room in the toe box). These are probably not the best choice for hiking or snowshoes, as they're a bit bulky (any boot of this type would be), but I'm able to drive a standard while wearing them with no trouble."
4,Good quality,"Good quality boot, heavy duty. I sent them back though, they ran small and were bulkier than I was wanting. I chose a different pair."
5,Fantastic product high quality,"Would suggest to anyone in the Northeast, warm, comfortable and built the way a boot of this caliber should be!"
2,"Amazon sent scuffed, used boots",Boots arrived scuffed on the sides and obvious wear on the bottoms. I was shocked because I did not expect such a blatant rip-off. Shame on you Amazon!
1,Garbage,"Have owned them 3 weeks and the rubber is cracking on both boots. I bought sorels because they were supposed to be a boot that would last a lifetime. I really was disappointed how they held up. I would not buy another pair of sorels again, they are crap."
2,Warm and waterproof... until they crack,I bought a pair of Caribous 3 years ago but I don't think I would buy this style again. They only lasted through one winter before they cracked around where the rubber bends at the toe. I walked a lot in them around the slushy streets of Toronto and found that I had to double sock it or I would get blisters. They are also a very heavy boot. In fairness I don't think they were designed to be a good walking boot. They are better for a walk down the driveway or maybe a ride on a snowmobile? At least they are warm and the liner is removeable so they can dry out if your feet tend to sweat a lot.
1,Terrible quality,This is one of the worst boots that I have ever purchased. These boots are such a poor quality that I have holes in the sides of the rubber of the boots. I only had these boots for 3 months and they are falling apart. Now I am in Antarctica with holes in my boots. I would advise anybody that even thinks of buying these boots should strongly reconsider spending your money and buy some boots from a better company that provides better products. If I bought these from a store I would go right into the store and show them the holes that formed from the broken plastic on the sides. I wouldgive them less than half a star if I could.
3,Good but not the Sorel of a few years ago,"My feet were never cold in sub zero Banff, but these Sorels, despite a higher selling price, are not a soft or as comfortable or as good a fit as when the boots were made in the USA. While expensive, they seem to be the best available in my price range. And most importantly, my feet were never cold."
4,Good for background music as well as performance.,"Some of the songs seem to evoke a mood rather then to get one up & dancing. Those choices are great for performing slower numbers where one would want to use interesting implements such as fire, swords or wings. They are also pretty handy to play before or after a performance to keep the atmosphere going. The drum solo (Disturb) piece is indeed fantastic. Most audience members take notice really quickly when that one comes on!Overall, a pretty good CD to keep around."
1,One size fits all,"Would've been a lot better without all the techno toppings: the sophistication of the original tracks used for this disc gets totally lost under the one-size-fits-all techno beats. If you're looking for techno with an oriental flavor: fine, but doesn't work the other way around without devaluating the source."
3,Not as fun as the rest of the General series,"I own every General title, from the original Panzer General to Panzer General III, from Star General to Fantasy General. I'm a fan of the game engine, but what really made these other games a blast were the campaigns that accompanied them. Star General does not include a campaign mode. So, while the game engine itself is still a blast to play, this game dries up in a hurry without being able to run my army through the rigors of war, absorbing casualties and building strengths. This game is the weakest attempt in what I view to be a great, but aging, game idea."
1,A waste of money,"One author's long-winded rant about what he thinks is wrong with the WWE. Not saying I necessarily disagree with many of his points, but really, there are better writers saying the same things FOR FREE on the web."
2,waste of time,"never have i seen so many words used to describe so little maybe after reading Bret Harts book eveerything else pales in comparison but ""insanity"" was insanely boring"
1,Not Worth It,"There are a couple of semi-interesting points and quotes in this book, but they are few and far between and padded out with pages and pages of forced, unfunny humor. This is a very poorly written book. I can forgive the intentionally bad photoshop pictures but the author's voice comes off as unprofessional and unfocused. This is an eye-roll-worthy blog screed padded out to book length. I'm still not sure what the entire point of this book was. The author got my money but I will be throwing this book away and recommending that others don't even bother. If he had released the interviews he did with D-Lo Brown, Missy Hyatt, and Tom Pritchard (who seemed to have a serious axe to grind) as a book I imagine that would have made for a much more interesting read. If readers want a thoughtful and well made assessment of the WWE and the wrestling industry as a whole, they should read ""Sex, Lies, and Headlocks"" instead."
5,A GREAT READ,"If you are looking for a well written book that has backstage gossip and in-depth analysis, then this is the book for you. I expected a lot when I ordered this and World Wrestling Insanity delivered on all counts. I'm happy that I ordered it and I hope there's a sequel. If there is, I'll happily plop my money down again. Truly a great read."
5,Excellent Work,"Exceptional book on many levels. James Guttman finds a way to expose all the ""Insanity"" of wrestling and does so in with humor. I really enjoyed both the behind the scenes tidbits and the writing style."
5,Insanity time capsule,"The best part of ""World Wrestling Insanity: The Decline and Fall of a Family Empire"" is that it will always be there as a look at WWE's craziest and most insane time period. The author uses sarcasm and some really insightful quotes from people in the business to make his points. Years from now, I will be able to look back at this book as a snapshot of this time period in sports entertainment.I found the best chapter to be the final one where he explains his love of the wrestling industry. I found myself nodding in agreement and even though I have gotten away from watching the WWE tv shows in the last few years this book helped me remember why I love it. And why I stopped watching it at times.Author James Guttman speaks out to long-time fans and never-been fans all at the same time. It's what makes World Wrestling Insanity such a unique and fun read."
5,Introducing The Insanity To Mainstream,Great book. This is one of the only wrestling books I've ever read that could really reach out to a mainstream audience. I'm a diehard fan and I loved it but others who don't watch wrestling can get it too. It's different from most internet inspired wrestling titles but still has enough good writing and backstage stuff to keep the hardcore fans happy.
2,Insane to Spend waste your money,There's really nothing new here that any watchers of WWE don't already know. I'm not sure what the point of the book was because I don't think it lived up to its hype. It's basically 200 pages of one person's opinions. My opinion is that Mr. McMahon won't be losing any sleep or inviting the author to join his KMA club.
1,Worst wrestling book I have ever read,"This is undoubtedly the most boring wrestling book that I have ever read. 99% of the time the author is giving derogatory statements about everything that the WWE stands for. I found the book so boring that after I had read 2/3 of it I put it aside, however, I do plan to later finish the book"
2,personal vendetta?,"I pre ordered this book looking forward to it. After i was done reading it, i was very upset. It is one thing to read about the ongoings and happenings behind the scenes of professional wrestling, but this book dosent offer that. Instead, we are treated to one mans opinion of the WWE, and his obvious dislike for Vince McMahon and HHH. James guttman comes across as someone who once tried to work for the WWE, but got rejected for whatever reason, and now holds a personal grudge. At times you get the feeling that he is reaching to find flaws in the WWE product. Granted, they do have their issues, but to disect every angle and storyline involving HHH and point out nothing but the negitives is inaproppriate. The author also claims to respect HHH, but constantly bashes him through out the book. uh?"
5,thank god for competition!!!,"TNA is the best thing going in pro wrestling today! They have something to prove and I think that in the next few years they will be major competition for WWE. I know that WWE can play the game(if they'd get some writers who actually know wrestling) and it'll be interesting to see how far TNA will go to become the top wrestling promotion. If you have any doubts, watch this dvd or if you can, watch Turning Point '04. The Triple X vs. AMW cage match is the best match in the past few years anywhere!! And to the guy who doesn't even have the gonads to put his name on the bad TNA reviews, I'm sure WWE would hire you as a writer.P.S. If TNA ever has a diva search, I will quite watching American wrestling."
5,AWESOME STUFF!!!,not much for me to say but if you like high flying amd fast paced action this is a must have for any wrestling fan!!!
1,This is Awful!,"Plain and simple this DVD is not worth more than 10 bucks. These matches are all from the past year and a half and should not all have been on this DVD. They had nothing from the Tennessee Era, which was a big disappointment, and was an even bigger mistake. The best thing about this DVD is a pretty lame interview with Jerry Lynn, it might have been boring but at least it was something you never seen before.The 2 bonus matches are terrible and they don't even edit out the commercials from the broadcast, how freaking low budget is that?TNA really dropped the ball on this DVD, I hope Volume 2 is much better, but with most of the DVD featuring matches from Impact I highly doubt it. If this truly is the best of this division, then this is one sorry division."
1,CAN PEOPLE SHUT UP ABOUT WWE,"Okay it has been going over 25 years-People reckon WWE are going to buy TNA like they did to WCW and ECW-they bought WCW and ECW at cheap prices-but TNA will refuse the money why?:The people who formed TNA were people from ECW and WCW-who were left without jobs-They won`t let that happen again.And to correctDAN C ""DJC""-AJ Styles was in WCW at the time when WWE bought it-No they didn`t get him why?-He said that WWE`s contract to him was laughable,and he told them to shove it up their A-S-S.Oh and TNA was formed by NWA-an even older company than even WWE`s predessors WWWF-TNA holds their NWA World Heavyweight Championship-the WWE championship is like a EURO title compared to the NWA World Heavyweight Title.And Rhyno-people only say he`s krap in WWE-because he and many,many other superstars were ""buried"" in WWE.sO IF ANY WWE fan wants to insult TNA-say something desent and nothing five-year old please.Same for tNA fans."
1,WWE,"OK lets get this strait STEVEN ""STEVO"" TNA is not all that, and even if it was, the WWE would buy it like they did WCW, and ECW. They will hire ur preshious AJ Styles, and then put him in the IC divishion, and he will suck. WWE has been going for over 25 years, and isnt gonna fall to a joke like TNA."
4,Silly Bimpson keeps on going.,"If you were around racing anytime in the past 30 years, you will enjoy this book. Simpson tells it like it was, and is still. He was there and did it all. If he told all the stories, and mentioned all the names, this book would be four times its size and no one would believe it really happened, but it did, and I was there in the mid years from about 1968 to about 1985. I'm still around with a head full of great memories of a great man who few know as a loving, careing, kind, and very generous friend. Thanks for this Great book Bill, and remember Life ain't no cherry.....Lynch"
2,"It may be the color separations, but . . .","Gray's choices of color seem awkward, and his arbitrary use of shapes (note the cover illustration!) seem underthought and poorly inspired.Included are B&W; photos of Gray's handsome sons and his writer wife (he hugs her in delight, while she looks off into space.) But they can't add any thing to the worth of his oeuvre. As the text points out, Gray has definitely followed in the footsteps of 20th-century masters, but has come up with precious few innvoations of his own.Those masters are still way out in front.Whenever a ""neglected"" artist falls through the cracks of public attention, there's usually a darned good reason. And as these reproductions make sadly clear, working on a HUGE canvas doesn't make a bland painting any better, any more than playing a tune at top volume can improve on mediocre playing."
4,LEGO Alpha Team GB Color,"A fun Gameboy game for Lego lovers! If you enjoy puzzles, games, and Legos, you'll enjoy this color GB game. Use your lego-building skills to help your team outsmart the opponents. With over 40 puzzles and activities, this would make a great gift for any puzzle or GB lover."
3,LEGO Alpha Team,"I got this video game for Christmas, and thought very highly of it. This video game really isn't rescuing people or going around finding treasure with your LEGO Team. It's more strategy. You have to move mirrors and stuff to the right position, and aim it so you can get to and opening in a house. After playing it, I discarded it, and I was very unhappy with my buy. But if strategy and smarts is for you, you should buy this game."
1,Short-Changed Product,"The product description states that there are 24 bulbs in the pack, however there were only 4 bulbs and even at $1.01 per bulb, a much better value can be had elsewhere."
2,Should have rethought this purchase,"I should have known since it has small pockets that it would not stay cold for very long. Yes it is flexible and you can cut it to several ice packs, but it is not very efficient."
5,Keeping it Kool,"I live in hot desert area so it's important to have a cooler when you go grocery shopping. I throw this ice pack in and it keeps everything cool til I get home. Even if I have to stop along the way home, I know my groceries requiring refrigeration are safe.I highly recommend this product"
3,Good quality,"I was hoping to find high quality hooks for my pegboard system. My previously purchased set from the big box store often fall out of the pegboard when removing tools for use. The DuraHooks easily screw in and won't pull out. In addition, it's easy to unscrew and move to a new location without marring the pegboard.The DuraHook products are high quality. These bin clips are very expensive for what you get, though they do work well.(5 stars for quality, lowered to 3 for value)"
4,Really Good for the Price,"I have had one of these for many years and it worked well taking many bumps from many gigs, until recently when I accidentally slammed the control box into the ground. In all the years of abuse, it was rock solid. After looking at replacement boxes out there I don't see anything better for the money. Sure it does have it's limitations and you can spend more for a fancier box, but if you are just running par cans or dumb lights and no DMX, then this is a good unit."
4,Not Overpriced,"So I got this Chauvet Timer/Control System the other day and found that this is a very nice compact unit that fits very nicely on my tripod & truss light stand. My control box is actually all black, not black & white as you see in the advertisement. But out does what out says it'll do. Very nice for the price."
3,Wasn't what I thought it would be,"I thought that I was ordering the DVD - what came to me was the book of music for the show. All fine and good, but maybe the description could be better."
3,"Fun, but not sturdy enough",It works very good and not having to worry about the lid to the pen being left off and drying out is great. But the drawing area came out of the frame after a couple hours of play.
5,Best present for 1 1/2 year old granddaughter!,The Flip 'n Doodle was my 1 1/2 year old granddaughter's favorite present and she sat for ages writing on it!
4,A Must for Paula Volsky Fans,"""The Sorcerer's Lady"" takes us to the suspiciously Venetian world of Lanthi Ume, where decadance and intrigue are the daily fare. Ms. Volsky beautifully mingles her usual blend of high society, politics, terror and fantasy together in this first book of her only trilogy thus far. The interest of ""The Sorcerer's Lady"" is compounded by Ms. Volsky's decision to place the main characters in a marriage at the outset - rather than the standard romance which leads *to* that happy state. For those who loved the richness of Illusion, (and want one more reference to the elusive Strell) this is the book for you."
3,I read it but I don't understand it,"There is a good reason I didn't understand a word of this book, right? You need a degree in political sciences to understand the conspiracies and a degree in psycology to appreceite and understand the characters. Chances are that this book was written for people alot older then 13. If you like that stuff, read this. If not, prepare to be completely and utterly bewildered. This is part of a series, right?"
4,very handy,"bought this book at a used book store just before our SW vacation.It came very handy in planning what sights to see before we went. It was also handy when we were driving around in the SW and came across an attraction,looked it up in the book and stopped.It even gives info on the history and other facts of the great SW.I was very happy to have it with us and I recommend it for your trip to the desert,especialy if you are from the NE like me."
2,good but...,"it's the exact sane album and they expect you to pay full price only difference is no marz, ABK is in itthats allno new songs nothing just ABK rappin over marz"
2,Did not work,"I purchased this to use in my 2003 VW Beetle. the stereo i installed fit fine, i removed the stereo outer bezel, and placed the main piece of the install kit to see how it was going to look and fit. the opening was too small, and i was unable to install it. I screwed in the side pieces but there was no way this thing was going to go over the stereo. Its just a normal single din aftermarket deck. the main piece of this kit seemed kinda warped. unhappy."
4,shopping addict,This product is the original euphoria I love this fragance. Good customer service and quick shipment.
5,"Excellent seller, great product",I have been using this perfume for a while. It is not too heavy and I get a lot of compliments of the great fragrance. I think the parfum has a longer lasting fragance. Give it a try you will not be disappointed.
4,Great Buy,"This was a great buy! Shipped quickly, no hassels, and perfume smells amazing. I couldn`t imagine spending $75.00 at the department store, when I can get the exact same thing for less than half the price!No regrets here."
1,not real anymore!,"i do always go to amazon first, and i did buy before euphoria and other perfume's too - no problems whatsoever but recently i've bough euphoria & dune and these are not real!! my mom use this (dune) for years so she's wears this not first time, the other person for whom i bought euphoria, also said that fragrance on the skin is different what she had beforei've heard about it but wasn't believer - looks like from the time amazon use other reseller they sell fake items (1-2 days for process)shame on you amazon!!!"
2,Smells like a few other fragrances... not a big deal.,"The smell of this fragrance is not incredible. I'm still wondering why it's gotten such great reviews. It's not very feminine. It could also be a scent for male. It's not light. It doesn't exactly smell like flowers. It's a somewhat pleasant fragrance but smells like nothing I've ever smelled in nature. The first day I wore it, when I got home, I immediately showered to get the scent off me because it was slightly nauseating. And I'm sure I've smelled at least 3 other brands that had nearly the EXACT SAME SCENT! It's really nothing to rave about. I did receive a compliment on the perfume but I also wore my Ann Taylor flowery perfume with it so that combination may have drawn the compliment... Anyway, do not buy. If you really want to see how it smells, try it on at Sephora or buy a sample vial off eBay like I did."
2,Im with Holly!,Wonderful intoxicating scent! Didn't last long though. I give the scent itself five stars but the length of the scent hardly merit's giving any star at all. Very costly for such a week perfume-sorry Calvin.
5,very good choise,i buy it for my mather birthday and she love it vrey mush its agood choise for the people you love very mush thats all.thanks.
5,Euphoria by Calvin Klein,"Euphoria by Calvin Klein for Women was on the top of my daughter's Christmas list, she LOVES IT! Beautiful bottle!"
4,Delivered right on time,"i have used this perfume before and absolutely love the scent. when i saw the price of this item, i thought it was too good to be true. It was 20 dollars less than the price in departmental stores and it arrived on the time stated by the sellers. I will definitely reoommend these sellers. One more thing though, the scent of euphoria doesn't last as long as it used to. I think this is a manufacturing ploy and its not very cute."
4,Euphoria Eau De Parfum Spray,"I would give Amazon 5 stars for price, free shipping, and quick arrival (came within 5 days of ordering). I love Euphoria! I spent a LOT more at department store for same exact item (same quality too)! However, Calvin Klein gets less stars because like other reviewers have said, the smell does not last long. Disappointing! Also, buyer beware: package perfume gift sets often contain OLDER perfumes!"
3,it does smell good,"I was a bit skeptical about buying perfume online, especially since this one have different reviews. So I researched the perfume from other web sites as well and it had ok kind of reviews so I bought it and they were right it does smell good."
2,Too Musky,"I loved the top notes of this perfume- all fruity and sensual. It really was a gorgeous fruity scent. But then I got beyond the top notes and all I smelled was musk. Lots of musk, and it was a very masculine musk. I smelled like a man most of the day. Needless to say, I'm not a huge fan. If I could only capture those top notes...And people aren't kidding on the staying power. This stuff lasts forever."
5,Great Product and Price,"I bought Calvin Klein For Women parfum as a Christmas gift to my sister. To see the smile on her face at Christmas when she opened her gift, was priceless. As for the cost, it was much less than the department stores at the local mall's. Thank you Amazon for a great deal!!"
5,the real thing,"I was a little worried that this might be a fake for the low price, but the product was genuine and came completely sealed and brand new in the box"
1,poor quality perfume,The perfume appeared to be a new box and bottle but obviously was NOT the perfume I ordered. I was to receive a full refund with the additional money for shipping and I have received nothing as of today. I will not order perfume again especially when it is shipped from Odeur Bonne.
1,Watered down,Xmas present for my girlfriend doesn't smell anywhere as good as the one she normally buys from Macy's. Will not buy anywhere else again. I urge any one out there that's indecisive just buy from Macy's. Yeah its double the price but its money well spend because the stuff on yeah is definitely watered down and smells like urine. Its that bad!!!!
3,box with no plastic wrap,"smells good but the box comes with no wrapper.dont know why is it so?is it a returned one or what.first time i ordered a perfume without knowing the smell ,i just went with the reviews and ordered it.iam not happy with the packing and never expected this from items sold directly by amazon.as far as smell is concerned,its good."
4,Euphoria by Calvin Klein eau de parfum spray,I have used this before and the fragrance is wonderful but it isn`t really long lasting.
3,Xmas 2009,I received the product quickly and the packaging was perfect. My only complaint is that the fragrance was very light as compared to other Euphoria purchases that were made at department stores. The price was very good. I have heard that shipping by air may affect the fragrance. As time goes by the fragrance seems to get stronger.
2,don't care for it,"i ordered it because i have a couple friends that love it. Well, i really don't care for it. And now i can't find the return sticky label to return it and i'm really bummed about that because it cost $55!!maybe if you could help me with that, that would be great!thanks Becky"
4,Lovely fregrance,"I only wish this was available in a true ""perfume"" form. The Eau De Parfum doesn't ""stay"" as long as I would like, but it is still a nice scent."
5,LOVE this fragrance!!,"I absolutely love this fragrance so I was happy to find it at such a good price. It arrived within a few days, which I was also very happy about."

5,Honeymoon CD,"I bought this for my honeymoon and we loved it. It has an awesome collection of songs. It's our romantic, go to favorite."
5,Mr.C,ordered this product on amazon because it is hard to find locally. This always works well on sunburns and other skin burns also. I have used this product extensively for years now and works better than any others I have tried.
5,Works Really Well!,"My mom bought a larger bottle of this stuff at least five or six years ago and ever since I have used it every summer. Since we're running low I turned to the internet to find more since i cannot find it in any stores. When I get sunburns, I thank God each time that I have this wonderful gel to sooth and basically eliminate the pain. Also, it seems to speed up healing. My last burn hurt quite a bit but was gone by the morning two days later.I highly recommend this product."
2,No more photos!,"This year's version does not include photos, which really takes the fun out of having this type of calendar. The photos are found on the digital version, which you have to go on-line to download. So, each page is all text as to a specific garden topic. I wish they would have made this more clear, as I would not have bought it."
1,Grieving A Loss,"I have adored the pictures & breif information on the daily pages for several years. I thought I had waited too late to purchase the 2003 calendar and missed out. I have waited a very long year for the 2004 edition. Now that I understand what has happened, I feel I have learned of the death of a dear friend. I only hope that we see this calendar again in its former glory!"
1,I miss the old days,"I have bought this calendar for many years. Last year I was very diasppointed to see that all the wonderful pictures have been replaced with facts and garden ""lore"". I loved the pictures that the previous calendars had. I think I'll buy The Far Side this year."
1,I'm Disappointed!,"Every year for Christmas I look forward to receiving this calendar. What I enjoyed most was seeing the beautiful color pages. How disappointing to open my calendar this year and find...no pictures--just written garden tips. Uh uh. This is not what I want to look at every day on my kitchen window sill. Apparently the offer of a ""digital version"" which can be downloaded is supposed to suffice. It will be hard to fit my computer in my kitchen window. I plan to return this calendar."
1,New format is disappointing,I have purchased this calendar for the past 2 years because of the beautiful pictures and descriptions of plants. I am extremely disappointed to see this year's format is simply text with no pictures. I will definitely not buy this calendar this year and will be actively looking for something to replace it.I sincerely hope next year's will return to the old format.
1,A horrible comedown,"I've bought this calendar as a gift for a gardener friend of mine for years. It's always been appreciated and it's become an institution of sorts. But the removal of the full color photographs, replaced with text and an occasional black and white drawing, makes this calendar pointless. Fortunately I was able to see this abortion of a calendar in a store before purchasing. I agree with the other reviewers; I'll never purchase another edition of this calendar unless the photographs are restored."
2,WAA!,"I, too, have been buying this calender for several years for myself and friends. Special ordered 4 copies for Christmas and, when I got them, found out they no longer contain the gorgeous pictures and info about particular plants. Bummer. There was probably a reason for the quality downgrade, but please reconsider and return to the previous format. Thanks!"
1,Very disappointing,"I have bought this calendar for several years and was very disappointed when I opened it and found there were NO pictures of any kind, although the box displayed a very attractive photo. Very deceptive of the publisher and author to change the format and not let the buyer know the contents."
1,I Wanted Pictures!!!,"I eagerly anticipated the arrival of this box calendar since the one I had purchased the year before was so enjoyable. When I open it up I was very disapointed to find text only. I wanted color, flowers, trees and secret gardens! Back to the store it went. In future I will peruse the calendar before I purchase it."
1,What a rip off!,"I buy this calender every year as a Christmas present for my wife who is a gardening fanatic. Imagine the disappointment on Christmas morning when the product did not live up to our expectations. No pictures, cheap paper and not worth even half the price. If we could we'd return it, as it is it probably won't even make good compost! Does anyone know why they ""fixed"" something that wasn't broken?"
1,Sharing everyone's disappointment,"I buy this calendar every year for the PICTURES!! What happened to them? I told myself that maybe the ""digital calendar"" would be OK, but when I went to the website and signed up, there aren't any pictures there either!!The daily quotes and info tidbits are fine, I suppose, but without the pictures not worth a ...! What is the point of this calendar?"
1,I Feel Cheated!!,"In my zeal to open the new year's garden calendar and set up to view 365 days of new garden pictures, I got a huge letdown. I kept turning pages until I realized that what I bought this year was a boring black and white word thing for my desk?!? Get real. Who wants a garden calendar that features WORDS? I thought this was a reliable calendar and I have bought it for many years, in fact I usually make my purchase in October. So this was tucked away until today when I opened it and got that huge SLAP in the face. Like many others who reviewed this calendar as I see above me, I am truly disappointed and will not purchase this calendar again unless it returns to the original format of Pictures, color pictures. If I want words, I'll buy a dictionary (which by the way, has more pictures than this garbage calendar)."
1,Just plain bad!,"I have been buying this calendar for several years now, but this year's edition is a terrible disappointment. Wish I had read the reviews before I bought mine, but who would have thought that after years of having a great product, they'd go and destroy this great calendar. Who's idea was it to nix the pictures??? That was the best part! And no lines on the back? I don't mind not having a holder for the torn off pages, I still have mine from last year. But this is past ridiculous. Doesn't seem to be rocket science to see how bad this calendar is compared to previous years. I'll be returning this calendar, hopefully somebody out there still knows how to make a decent daily calendar. This was a waste of a good tree."
1,365 Days in the Garden Page-A-Day Calendar 2002,"This year, for some reason, the calendar contains text only - none of the beautiful pictures. I appreciate Barbara Damrosch's gardening tips, but really buy the calendar for the pictures."
1,"Workman Publishing, Shame on You!!","What were you thinking, Workman, by leaving out the beautiful pictures? I've been buying this calendar each year for my husband ( and for myself!) because of the outstanding quality photos of flowers and gardens. If I had peeked inside the box before buying it, I would have disappointedly left it in the store. Please add the pretty pictures for next year's calendar. I'll wait."
1,Where are the photographs?,"At first I thought my sister had purchased a different calendar for me as a Christmas gift. The pictures are what I loved most about the previous calendars! Now that I know the purchase wasn't a mistake on her part, I'll let her as well as other family members know to avoid buying this calendar for me in the future unless it returns to the previous format with all the beautiful photographs."
1,Barbara - What Happened?,"I have received this calendar as a Christmas present for a number of years. Being an avid gardener and having watched Barbara and her husband on TV, I always enjoyed the lovely colored photos and gardening tips from these two top-notch gardeners. Sadly, I must agree with the other reviewers that the 2002 version of this calendar is just awful. Cheaply printed on newsprint-type pulp paper, it contains absolutely no pictures of any kind. The tips are poor also. I would not recommend this calendar to anyone and I also plan to return mine."
5,surprisingly better,"At first, like many others apparantly, I was disappointed that the beautiful color pictures on each page of this calendar series were gone. Then I settled into reading the text and realized immediately that the pictures were taking up valuable space better used by this author's truly impressive store of knowledge. I learned a great deal and was inspired to garden in new and imaginative ways."
1,Thank you my DEAR AMAZON!!!,"Ordered this filter to my buick after confirming the phrase ""This product fits your 2002 Buick Century"" ..... This product is NOT SUITABLE FOR MY BUICK. Thank you my DEAR AMAZON!!!"
5,A masterpiece of Ambient Electronica,"One of the best CD's for anyone to own. If you are new to ambient music, this is a great gateway. If you are well versed, this cd will find a good home in your collection and regular rotation in your CD player (or iPod). I first encounterd this CD four years ago. Since then I have sampled an array of ambient/electronical music, yet I still find myself listening to this CD regularly, enjoying every song, and thinking of the memories that I have made. Perfect for just lounging, love making, driving, relaxing, and being hungover, everytrack is golden and well fitted. With it's cool sounds, soft vocals, downtempo beat, and various rhythms its a wonder that there are only four reviews of this album. Check out: Escape, Count on You, signs of love, slipinside, home and dry, if you could see my eyes (probably my favorite), all this love, shine, 16 again."
5,What a Surprise!!,I origionally picked up this disk in a pack of 5 others including Electro-chill and Electro-burn (also 2 AMAZING disks)and pushed it aside because of these previous two. This is one of my fave disks I have EVER owned. The music is relaxing yet up-beat and I will never part with this collection!!!
5,Later On,"""Later"" is an innovative chill-out cd that has subtle hints of synth pop and electronic music. There are 14 songs on each of the 2 cds. ""Escape"" by 16B feat. Morel, ""In The Waiting Line"" by Zero 7, ""Naturally"" (Yearn Mix) by Kim Bee, ""Home and Dry"" (Ambient Mix) by the Pet Shop Boys, ""Another Chance"" by Roger Sanchez (Afterlife Remix), and ""Kissing"" by Bliss are some of the multiple smooth songs on the ""Later"" compilation. ""Later"" is good for those who like chillout compilations with a lounge type vibe."
5,Good Product,"Don't spend your money on an overpriced name brand filter when you can have one of these. I replaced the stock air box of my 98 Crown Victoria (4.6L V8) with one of these. This thing is huge, very nice looking, and high quality. I thought torque would go down but it actually went up just a little along with the hp. Nothing exciting but just enough to notice, along with a very nice growl (huge difference there). I'm sure it will contribute VERY nicely to a new intake manifold (which I plan to install later down the road) and a computer tune. I was advised by other Crown Vic enthusiasts to disconnect the battery upon installation and then reconnect before starting the engine to let the computer ""relearn"" running with the new filter but I didn't do that. Perhaps I could get more hp/tq had I done that, but I can always do that later.Anyway, I'm very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheaper alternative for a CAI setup!"
1,Have not received,Was this a rip off? Not received as of this date. What is the next step. Can I cancel payment?
1,mild flavor no cooking instructions,This had a very miled flavor. Neither my husbund or I liked without adding something to it. There was no cooking instrcutions which meant I had to guess. Boiled like white rice for 30 minutes came out good. I would not buy again.
5,Lego Racer Video Game,My son loves Lego's. He loves the game although he thinks it's a little difficult for a 61/2 year old
4,Gets better and better as you get into the story,"The book is fiction but the island, Laerg, is similar to an island in the Outer Hebrides which was evacuated in 1930. See the interesting article in Wikipedia entitled St. Kilko. The narrator learns his brother, supposedly dead long ago, has a different name and is in the British military and is involved in evacuating a defense facility from Laerg. The book is hugely concerned with the fierce October weather and builds to an exciting time in the carefully plotted story, which I came to appreciate more and more as I read it. Lots of technical weather and navigational language but well worh reading, with an ending I appreicated."
5,Una novela que capta la atencíon de principio a fin.,"La investigación de la muerte de su padre y el socio de este llevan a Bemjamin Weaver al desconocido mundo de la naciente Bolsa de Londres, sus intrigas, manipulaciones, estafas, mentiras y crimenes. Muy bien logradas las descripciones que el autor hace del Londres de principios del siglo XIX, sus clases sociales, condiciones de vida, criminalidad, etc."
1,Poor little fox!,"The fox toy is cute. My beagle puppy was super excited to have a new friend to play with. Her little fox friend didn't make it past one day. Within a couple hours of play, my puppy had chewed the ears off, given fox a hair cut (removed most of the hair from his back)' and opened up a seam and was pulling out stuffing. My puppy is 7 months old and weighs about 15 pounds. Poor fox would have met his end much faster with a larger dog. I would not recommend this toy if your dog likes to chew."
3,Excessive Shipping Charges,"Worked well, but the shipping charges were excessive for something that weighs next to nothing."
3,From someone who knows nothing about DBZ,"Overall I like the concept of DBZ though I've never had the patience to watch an entire episode.As far as the game is concerned:Pros:- Game is responsive and fight mechanics are well implemented.- Visuals are as good as I've seen them on Budokai 3 on the PS2.Cons:- In the ""quest"" mode- which is essentially a string of fights punctuated by chatter between characters, unless you are a DBZ fan, it makes no sense whatsoever. So I ended up just clicking X until the lengthy dialog was over so I can resume fighting.If you're a fan of the show then this game's great."
2,"Ok, but low quality","This pack has a lot of useful compartments, which I love. That's the only thing good about it, though.I found this pack rather stiff and uncomfortable compared to another pack I purchased for comparison. The shoulder straps were not very giving; they seemed restrictive in the shoulders, even for my small body. The pack barely fit my 17"" laptop, and then only when the provided insert was not in place. (There is still plenty of padding without the insert.) The zippers are the small, cheap kind that don't zip well and look like they will break under any load or just over time. The water bottle holders are small, but still usable if your water bottle isn't too wide.The quality of this pack was disappointing for the price, so I sent it back. If you can put up with a little discomfort, I would say it's worth spending at most $50 for."
3,Good and a half,"This is a nice big coffee table book on Law and Order. It, however, only goes to 2003. It has a lot of great charactor sketches and nice large photos--black and white-- of the cast until that point. Obviously, a lot has happened on the show since--most important the death of Orbach/Briscoe. There are more current sources of information, but as a collectors piece, very good"
5,This Book Is Superb,"Apart from being a Law & Order fan, I'm very interested in photography. Law & Order Crime Scenes is the perfect balance of inside information on the show and fascinating photographs. This book is unique and is a true testament to the talent that makes Law & Order so special. I highly recommend it."
4,Honest and accommodating.,"This company was quick to send the book out. When the book arrived, it was a little bit more worn, than was described on their description. I reported this to the company. They were very quick in responding to my report. They gave me a full refund, and told me they didn't have another book to replace it. So, I could keep the book they sent. I would order from them again, because of their quick response, accommodation, and honesty. The item, I would rate 3 stars. The company, I would rate ""5"" stars. That's why I settled on 4 stars."
5,Works great!,I use it to loosen/unscrew the lug nuts on my car's wheels when changing tires or doing small repair jobs.
2,About as interesting as a tumbleweed is to cattle,"The writing is very good. She has a very good poetic sense and the imagery is excellent. That said, however, the story is at first engaging but leaves the reader wanting with too many unfinished details. I think the author became confused between offering this as a story or as an account."
1,Nightmare,"I felt like I was wading through a mish mash of feminist, ecological, dystopic mayhem without a conclusion. Only true feminists and the anti-porn league will appreciate the book and its biblical references confuse evryone but the vicar. Avoid this book at all costs."
3,Shows the evolution of the writer,"Good god! Does everyone expect a polished, happy ending of every novel? Try reading some of Atwoods other works. _Cat's Eye_ for example leaves you hanging on the end of the novel as well. This was a fascinating novel, filled with the unclaimed promises of patriarchial society."
4,"Loved the book, very futuristic and intriguing.",Although the end of this book left me wanting more information about the central character and her fate I loved the concept of this book. A great deal of thought has been provoked by Ms. Atwoods futuristic novel and it certainly makes one think about such things as freedom/s and control and the strength of the human spirit. Frightening and interesting at the same time.
2,Thoughtful premises followed by an unsatisfactory ending,"While the Orwellian concept of a government controlled society is initially intriguing, the character development is sluggish, and many of the terms used in the book are inadequately defined."
4,Horrifyingly possible and dangerously intriguing!,"The Handmaid's Tale is a terrifying depiction of life in a religiously warped futuristic America... Despite the initial beliefs, Atwood is commenting more on today's society than on our future world, and this is a wonderful book which ought to be taken seriously... Shocking!"
5,Too Close for Comfort,"This should be required reading for every female in this country over the age of 16. I read this book in college and it scared the bejeezus out of me then. So much so that I refused for years to have an ATM card. Now that the extreme right and the Moral Majority have nearly taken over the Republican party and so many of our military leaders have become rabid Fundamentalists, it's too close to a potential future."
2,Thought provoking but heavy-handed,"""The Handmaid's Tale"" is a frightening story to be sure, and is certainly a worthy accomplishment, but I found it lacking in a certain... spontanaeity? No, that's not the right word, but it seemed to me that the entire story was a little too well planned, a little too self-conscious. Overly analytical. The author obviously had planned all the topics she wanted to discuss in the novel, and at every turn she pumps the reader with more sophisticated imagery and allusions. A good novel, but lacking subtlety. There, that's the right word, subtlety."
3,This book left me questioning todays morals and standards.,"Margarat Atwood cleverly asks readers to question the future and the power that some people have over each other in her book ""The Handmaids Tale"". Offred, the main charector, left much to the imagination, and through-out the book I was forced to relate their circumstances to ours today. This book touched me, it is a very effective and painfull piece of writing."
2,Better options available,This thing self-destructed when used over hot coals (with the grill lid up).
4,"It's an ""Instant-read"" thermometer","Well, not exactly ""instant"".......but it is pretty quick.Works fine, doing exactly what it's supposed to.There's an important tip in the instructions:""WARNING: DO NOT LEAVE THERMOMETER INSIDE A HOT GRILL OR OVEN. THERMOMETER IS AN INSTANT-READ THERMOMETER AND SHOULD NOT BE LEFT IN MEAT AS IT IS COOKING"""
4,what about color and the commercial work?,John Szarkowski is one of my favorite writers on photographic subjects. He is brief but every sentence is worth reading. He has also picked a lot of Ansel Adams photos that you've probably never seen. But Ansel Adams had to pay the bills and consequently did some work in color and some commercial (advertising) work. None of that is represented here and our view of the artist is therefore distorted.
5,Ansel Adams at 100,"WOW! What more is there to say? Plenty. This book is a have to have for any lover of the art of Black and White photography. Excellent, A+, 5 star and ten out of ten! Buy this book you will not be disappointed.."
3,The hardcover is good but the softcover is much better!,"Hardcover - 3 starsSoftcover - 5 starsI am a little dissapointed in the hardcover version. Some prints seem vague and a few with ink offset problems. Overall, the prints look quite low in contrast. I've seen AA's original prints, including the exact AA at 100 exhibit, and find the low contrast hard to accept. If you are interested in this book, the softcover version is a lot better, almost flawless - a true must-have for AA fans. Yes the print size is smaller than those in the hardcover, but the price is also smaller. It's interesting to notice that the softcover is printed in Germany while the hardcover I saw is in the US."
5,Excellent Book!!!,"This book is a very detailed overview of the 2002 Formula 1 season. Im not sure why it says 2002-2003 on the cover because it is only about the 2002 season. This book is well worth the price it is huge and covers the season, the drivers, the teams and the events of the 2002 season in full detail with 100's of color pictures. A must own for any formula 1 fan."
5,Better than other nail products I've tried,"I will start by saying I do not have healthy beautiful nails. My nails are weak, they bend, break, and peal. This product helps me keep my nails looking their best. I still do not have long nails, but when I keep up with this system, I can keep my nails fashionably short and neat. My nails are often healthy enough to add color polish. Something I would not dare to do before. I am in my 30's and have had lots of time to try all the other nail hardeners. This system is the best I've tried. I would and do recommend to friends."
3,Not as good as many other releases by the great Doc W...,"I was disappointed in this one, despite being a Watson fan of 40 years standing, having owned at least a half-dozen of his LP's from the '60's and 70's. The best cuts on here are ""Bottle of Wine"" and ""If I Needed You"" but the other nine tracks are of less interest. With most of my other Watson products, repeated listening is common. As for ""Then and Now"" I heard it twice, and I believe I will pass it on to a guitar pickin' buddy in Oklahoma."
3,Chisel not chisels,I know the photogragh shows chisels and the product description says chisels but you are buying one chisel.
3,Healthy Meat and Potatoes book,Quality of book good but recipes too upscale ingredients for my taste...poor people like me do not use wine for cooking.
1,Healthy BUT NOT TASTY,"I am so disappointed in this cookbook. It is HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE. I have great waterless cookware and I know how to use it. I've made the Braised Roast Pork Tenderloin with Cabbage and Apples three times thinking I must have done something wrong.... I didn't. It takes an hour to prepare and when done tastes like vinegar (and I used high end GIN to make it). It is tasteless and a big waste of time and money. Low calories -- horrible taste -- and it is not the lack of salt that makes it that way."
1,need best service is late,"is very late the service of send, no receiver the battery to time. the company send for second battery tks"
3,Billabong for Work,"Flows like a stagnant backwater - but - with 40 tracks, and most being eminently listenable the release isn't bad. very mixed: genre, tempo, instrumentation, era. this can be played where mass appeal is critical, with few not finding something to like. 3.5 stars for interesting diversity."
2,A Deceiving Misnomer,"The Bad - No song in this album is completely acoustic. The album title probably refers the occasional sound of guitar plucks and bongos in some songs. Thus, expect no new or unplugged versions. Everything But The Girl is a fantastic group with an album called Acoustic... Why did this album pick their dance club hit single Missing which has nothing acoustic in it? And please, the album didn't have to go way back Bob Dylan and Simon & Garfunkel era! They just don't mix well with Dido & Nickelback!The Good - We get to listen to other talented artists we otherwise would've ignored completely."
5,Can't really blame Jim.,"Sorry, but I've had silly, violent, disgusting wanna-be girls stalk me. I wasn't stupid enough to encourage, or sleep with them, though.Jim did. I'm glad he's out, though. I truly can't say that I'd respond differently given the chance."
2,Good reading material,"Unfortunately, not very practical. While the ""broken record"" technique will work in many situations, when you use the assertiveness techniques advised in the book you are supposed to completely ignore the consequences of your own behaviour."
2,Great music from the show,"I purchased this cd a while ago.It has some of the music from the episodes that I've seen on cartoon network.There is charactor dialogue on some of the tracks --- BUT ---it's in japaneese.It's actually sort of annoying -- they laid it down over the top of track.It is sort of like the DJ that is talking over the intro of a song.One of my favorite tracks is missing ... the guitar music used when Lupin and the others are in the stadium in Rio.The cd has alot of remixes and deals with music from the series from the late 70's and 80's.The show did run from '67 -- 228 episodes, 8 feature length movies, 13 tv movies.(It's going to take a long time for them to translate all of that material) :-(I guess the producers wanted to capture the essence of the series but had to make omissions due to the shows evolution.Overall I got 3 tracks that I was familiar with. The one I really wanted wasn't there.Hope this helps"
4,"Cute, colorful puzzles","This set is great, but so far we've only played with the animal puzzle. It helps stimulate thinking and matching, as well as developming colors and words for each animal. My daughter is 16 months old and plays with a similar set at her school so this was a no brainer. She likes to mix and match and then start all over again. Good toy to keep little ones occupied for a little while, or even longer if you sit down with them and make it a learning experience. Very colorful and easy to use---can't go wrong with Melissa & Doug toys!"
4,"Colourful, interesting and strong toys for little ones","My little grandson and playmates have had a lovely time with these puzzles, especially the vehicles one. They appeal to a wide age range, and depending on your little one's ability level, they will last a while if cycled in and out of the toy shelves... and are great to have on hand as littler ones visit or arrive. On average though, great from about 18 months, although many will be interested and able before (or after) this, with or without your help.While I am very happy with my purchase (made many months ago), I am very disappointed to hear that the 3-pack isn't available any more, and hope that Amazon has either deleted the 3-pack offer from the website, or reinstated it."
3,All the pieces are the same!,"Not very happy about these puzzles, the pieces are all the same, which it is not a big deal because he figured it out eventually but it doesn't seem to be fun neither challenging for him. I wouldn't recommend them."
2,"Flawed, but cute","I was looking for wooden puzzles for my daughter when I stumbled across these. They looked colorful and fun. I read the reviews, and saw one that said the pieces were all the same shape. Looking at the picture of the puzzle, I didn't understand that comment, the animals all looked like different shapes and sizes to me. Once we received the puzzles, I understood. The removable pieces are all little half-arch shaped pieces, and the majority of the animal is not removable. The only part that removes are the back legs, so to speak, of the animals, and the cabs on the vehicles.They are still functional and maybe they could inspire some creativity by pairing the wrong legs with wrong animals, but it definitely wasn't what I was looking for. For the good price, it isn't worth returning as my daughter will play with it, but I wouldn't reccommend them to a friend."
5,"Very well-made, durable, and bright. Toddlers love these!","Melissa & Doug makes great puzzles for toddlers. This set contains three different puzzles: farm, cars, and animals. They are brightly colored, durable, and very well-made. The little pegs help with fine motor skills and coordination. Our little ones reaches for these and just loves playing with them.They are made of wood, with non-toxic paints. Very high quality, especially for the price!"
3,little disappointed,My granddaughter is only 20 months so maybe that is part of the problem but I was disappointed in that the puzzle pieces that come out are only half of the picture and that seems kind of weird. She is not interested in playing with it. I guess the point is to match the halves that come out to the halves that are permanently in the puzzle but that was not what I intended to buy and I wish it had been more clear about that.
2,Could Be Better,"We have a lot of Melissa & Doug brand toys and love them but I think that this falls short of the mark. We bought this for our 19-month-old daughter who loves puzzles, but she doesn't use this set. It is wooden which I love. It's brightly colored which holds a child's interest. However, the little plastic handles that you use to pick up the puzzles pieces are too short and not wide enough. It makes it a little difficult to grab the pieces. Also, the entire puzzle piece doesn't come out, only part of the picture comes out, which wasn't in the description. It's not as heavy and sturdy as other puzzles we have by the same company. It's okay, but nothing special."
4,Great Puzzles!,These puzzles are great and colorful. They are nice because I was able to separate the pack of individually wrapped puzzles to give each one as separate gifts. My 2 year old really enjoys her puzzle. My friend's daughter also really enjoys her puzzle. Great price for these puzzles!!
4,Cute set,"I bought this puzzle set for my little nephew. It really is a good set, the only thing I have to complain about is the cut out design.What I mean is by the picture I thought the whole image came out, but only part of the image comes out. For example, not the whole car puzzle comes out, only part of the car comes out. Its not a flaw its just the way they cut this particular puzzle. But other than that it is great and my little nephew loves it!"
3,Good quality but not great,This is a nice wood puzzle set that is well done for the price. Some of the pegs have broken off but I guess that is to be expected over time.
1,"Horrible, took the puzzles away from my 14 month old son","Terrible design. All the pieces are the same and the pegs are very small and a choking hazard. For the animal puzzle, all the pieces are just the hind quarters; not very interesting. I love Melissa and Doug products and purchased other chunky puzzles, stacking shapes, and magnets. Very disappointed and surprised. I actually thought they may be couterfeit. Don't be pulled in by the value pricing."
2,Flawed,"I usually really like Doug and Melissa products; oversall they are well made, colorful, and fun. This puzzle is the exception - neither my toddler nor I like it. All the pieces are the same shape, and only 1/2 of each animal is removable. In other words the cow piece is the same as the horse, sheep, etc. - the only difference is the color of the pieces. Having interchangable pieces just isn't fun for my son - he gets no feeling of accomplishment when he gets the pieces and doesn't understand why he can't remove the entire animal as one piece."
4,Melissa and Doug Mix and Match Puzzle Bundle...,"A great basic collection of the Melissa and Doug puzzle and board series. My son, age 20 months, has the dexterity to work the puzzles, is interested in the images on the puzzles, and finds great success in matching the pieces to their respective places. The colors are lively. The puzzles are well made. A great and worthy purchase!!!"
3,Make Sure It Fits,"This is a good quality product, but I thought it woudl fit my 2004 GMC Sierra. It didn't. It is tough to find information to help purchase the right kit for a particular vehicle."
5,Very handy book,"I've used a couple of ideas from this book. It is very easy to use. The table of contents is very detailed.I like how the book is organized. He gives you activities to do with absolutely NO supplies all the way up to using a chalkboard and pen and paper with your students.Honestly I probably will not end up using MOST of the ideas in the book, but it does get me thinking and helps spark other ideas.Good price and good book. Would recommend for anyone needing ideas for activities to use with limited supplies. All ages appropriate."
4,Very useful,A slim book but full of good ideas. I carry this around with me for those times when I'm called in to cover for other teachers.
3,a fitting question,"When I bought this using the make and model to correctly order the bra for a Christmas present for my husband, I was disappointed to find out that part of the bra did not fit his vehicle. He did like the partial cover that did fit and it looked real good. Considering how much the bra cost, it was disappointing that a portion of it can not be used."
4,Shrek Rocks,"My 8-year old says, ""It really rocks but the ""Evil Queen's Castle"" level is a bit hard. But that's just my opinion. ""Lancelot's castle attack"" is really,really fun. Overall it's a really good game. The graphics are very good. It would be too hard for younger kids, like 4-5 year olds."""
3,Not really sour?,"They taste very sweet, and only have a one second increment of any flavor of sourness. They are okay, but I prefer my cry baby tears."
4,The Fall of Freddy the Leaf,"I bought this book when my son was small, to explain the concept of death to him. The story is told gently and lovingly and children relate well to it. I still have this book and my son is now 25 years old! This shows how much I appreciated it then and now I read it to my grandchildren!"
1,This book can be devastating to a child's self esteem.,"Virginia's Fairfax County public schools use this book in their Family Life Education program. I reviewed it prior to the school using it with my 8-year son. It is suitable for children whose parents are atheists. It teaches the child that he and his parents are no more valuable than a leaf on a tree, or the dirt the leaf becomes. It is totally unsuitable for children whose parents believe that people were created by a God, such as the Islamic, Judaic, or Christian religions. The book does not teach the child that he is a special creation of God and that God created the Universe for his enjoyment. It does not teach the child that after leading a good life, God will take him to live with his parents and God forever. Instead, it teaches self concepts which are very depressing."
4,Very organized help book,"I wish there was more information on the cases for Russian but besides that, excellent book. Extremely organized and easy to read- in a great format. Anyone that is not very familiar with English grammar should get this book."
5,Louise Hay,Great DVD. Everyone should watch this DVD. It can heal a lot of people and help understand life and get healthier at the same time.
5,Life changing and mind expanding,"First of all this is absolutely not a copy-cat of The Secret or What The Bleep. I have seen both versions of The Secret AND What the Bleep and while they all present the same message, The Secret does not get into the actual scientific foundation behind the Law of Attraction nearly as extensively as this film did. ""What the Bleep"" did, but it didn't come from the scientists/medical professionals who had experienced the concept personally in their own healing. This movie was loaned to me by a co-worker who made me promise to watch the movie that night! When I got home I was tempted to watch my usual favorites on TV but opted to keep my promise. I was not sorry. I was so profoundly moved that I had to get up early to watch it again before heading off to work! I now want my own copy so I can pull it out often to continue growing in it until it's concepts and affirmations become second nature to me. I'm also purchasing the audio CD so I can play while I'm on the road."
4,Wonderful message except.....,I love all of Louise Hay's work. The movie is very imformative and has a wonderful message. The only thing I didn't like is the woman that is on the journey mumbles and talks soft. I found this quite distracting. I wanted to relax and enjoy this movie and had to keep trying to understand what she was saying.
5,A Wonderful Movie,This movie uplifts you and helps you put a positive spin on your life. I gave this movie to my adult children and their spouses and have watched it numerous times myself. I recommend this movie to everyone.
5,"Indeed, Life Changing","This is a video everyone should see. It shows you how we need to change the way we look at life and to live in the present. We really are in charge of our destiny. I watched it several times with different people. Every time I watched it, I saw something I missed before. It is uplifting and inspiring."
5,She's great,"It's really the same message - you create your own future with your thoughts, and it's another great forum for remembering the message. Louise Hay is inspirational."
5,Awesome Lifeskills Movie,"This movie by Louis Hayes is truly a beautiful thing. The down to earth expression of true feelings as protrayed by the young women is amazingly authenic in real people's lives today. The Movie is something everyone should see to help validate the true power within ourselves to overcome life's obstecles and empower us to reach for our greatest potential. Going within and loving ourselves first allows us to give service to others. This is an awesome tool on this thing called life's journey. Sincerely, Linda J. Woods"
5,You can heal your life - tape,"I haven't watched it yet. I'm planning to have a group of friends, a kind of slumber party, and watch it together.Joana"
1,Was a complete waste of time!,You can't expect Oprah's new age movement to save your life. Only GOD can do that. Try HIM...He really works!!!
5,"Much much better than The Secret, indeed!","This film is very useful and educational to everyone who wants to improve the quality of their life to the detail and start attracting a better future. I especially recommend the expanded version, since the added expert interviews enhance the great movie. One good thing about this film is that it gives specific instructions on how to improve one's thinking.I hope Louise has a lot more great surprises for all of us!"
2,Read the book Skip the movie!~,Read the book Skip the movie!~ Was not worth my time or the money no biggie just so so. the book is 10 times better and has the dis-ease list of ailments and prayers. I would not recommend!~
5,Inspiring - Healing Movie,"I was inspired to go back and watch this again. For anyone wanting to heal their life, this is a wonderfully positive movie."
4,Great Movie!,"Someone had recommended this movie to me, and I really enjoyed it. It tells a great story on a level that everyone can understand about changing your life. Louise Hay is an amazing person and I really enjoyed the interviews with her throughout the movie."
4,You Can Heal Your Life,"This movie is a very good way to explain the Law of Attraction. I would have given this movie 5 stars except for the fact that I had difficulty understanding the thoughts that were expressed by the woman who was experiencing difficulty in her life. I found myself turning up the volume when she came on the screen and still had difficulty making out what she was supposed to be thinking. Other than that, I was very impressed with Louise Hay and the other speakers in this program. I was familiar with some of them, such as Dr. Wayne Dyer, Cheryl Richardson and Esther and Jerry Hickes. However, I had not yet read anything by Louise Hay. The fact that the book that this movie is based on has been around for so many years is a testament to it's power. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to become more clear on how we create our own lives by our thoughts. When you really get the concepts, it all makes sense."
4,Titans,The product was great -but the movie was not as good as I remembered. Thanks for the speedy return.Great! Will do business again
5,Awesome movie,This version is definitely better than the original clash. This is by far more technical. The 3d is mind bending. Great entertainment for whole family. Recommended.
5,Fantastic movie but too many previews on this inexpensive version,Not sure what I expected for $5 you will want to start the film a while before you are ready to sit down and watch.
1,Just another sorry hollywood remake,"For those unfamiliar with Greek mythology, this latest version may be entertaining, especially to young kids, but the story line is far removed from the real story of Perseus. I would rather watch the old version (1981) even with less animation and less gruesome fights to this; at least, the old version is more educational and a bit more faithful to the mythology."
4,Good movie,"I like this remake. The graphics are mcuh better than the original and the story remains the same, but fills in more detail."
4,I actually liked this movie,A lot of people seem to think it's a dumb movie but I liked it. It had a few cute references to the original. The graphics are pretty impressive and the cast is brilliant.
4,A Very Excellent Remake,"I am a big Sam Worthington fan. I am also a fan of Sci-Fi and Fantasy. Combining these two just got better. Since the original was basically made WAY before Avatar type animation or graphics, to see this remake done at this level, just gets puts the icing on the cake. I own both and have purchased the next in the series Wrath of the Titans. Enjoy yourselves."
3,Not bad,Is a good film but im not crazy about it. Actually I like Gijnn.. :) He is not talking to much but the best caracter (I think) ohhhh my best part is when the guy try to play on the flute some of the guys just brake it...but he is not give up...he took out frome the bag an other one :)
4,Mythology,Another movie I bought for myself. It's a good movie at a good price. The cover came in good shape and the DVD was and still is in good shape.
5,Please don't listen to the negative reviews!,I almost passed on this movie because of all the negative reviews it was getting but I just finished watching Clash Of the Titans and I really enjoyed the film!I have never seen the original one so I can't compare the two but this movie completely satisfied my action/drama/special effects appetite.Decide for yourself you won't be disappointed!
1,clash of the idiots,The ending of this movie SUCKED. The original version made in the 70's blows this remake out of the water
1,Junk,"3 d doesn't work and the movie is garbage. I would not wish this on my enemies.I wasted money on a 3-D tv and 3-D bluray set, and high end glasses which I nowintend to throw out."
4,Ehhh,"The movie itself was dry, and at parts kind of confusing but the 3D was incredible. It felt like the theatre and the graphics are really awesome. Its just a very dry story."
4,Could Be Better.,"Well, I saw the original 1981 Clash Of The Titans Movie and I thought it was really good. Then I saw this and thought ""well, this is a little bit disappointing, but it was fun"". Yes, that's exactly what happened. The reason being, that there's a few things they could have done better. For starters, why is Liam Neeson barely even in the movie??? He's a big name actor now, isn't he??? Though I admit I didn't like this movie as much as the original, I still think it's a good enough movie to have in my collection. Also, this is not a ripoff of the game God Of War!"
1,Good CGI bad film,"I love Greek Mythology. One encounters so much, when reading Shakespeare or Marlowe. This movie however, has no interest in the mythological story as written (or verbally handed down through the ages). Not that the story actually happened, but astonishing how much distain this film displays for the source material.Horrible this. I much prefer the 1981 Ray Harryhausen version."
2,Trash of the Titans,"It seems that the trend in Hollywood is along as you have special effects, an actual story is not necessary. Doing a remake is not bad if you can still retain the elements that made the original good. In this remake, the movie lacked a consistent story, the acting was not good, and the Kraken looked like the Godzilla 2000's cousin. Say what you want about the original, but for its time, it was a damn good movie; good effects, excellent story, and brilliant acting (Laurence Olivier and Maggie Smith were divine). Hopefully they will follow one thing from the original and not make a sequel. Please DO NOT release the Kraken again!"
5,Bridget's Review,My husband and I went to see Clash of the Titans with Krista and Corey yesterday and I loved it even more than I thought I would. It was so intense and I could not take my eyes off the screen. This is definitely a movie I will add to my collection.
3,Wasn't what I had ordered.,"When I got this, I thought it would just be the regular Clash Of The Titans, but instead I got a weird disk that had ""Clash Of The Titans"" in english at the top, but then it had it in french below that. So I got some weird disk that's like a French/English hybrid."
3,Clash Edition,"It 's amazing package color. It's a great movie with a lot of special features, the sound e imagem was amazing too."
2,Disappointing,"I recently purchased a 3d tv/home entertainment system combo and have been impressed by the movies I've seen so far. I received Clash of the Titans as a Christmas gift and was looking forward to seeing a 3d remake of a classic film. Even with all the modern technology that this movie utilizes, I'm sad to say that it still doesn't come close to matching the quality and viewing experience of the original. Like some of the other reviewers have said, the plot of this new film is inacurate and feeble. And as to the ""3d ness"" of the film, it's unimpressive. My wife and I had a couple over to show off our new system and I found myself apologizing to them after the movie was over. So, in conclusion, I would recommend passing on this fim and opting on buying the original."
1,Good Story - Bad 3D,"I don't know why some 3D dvd's have such good 3D full emersion effects (like Resident Evil) and some stink, but unfortunately Clash stinks. Only the people seem to have any depth at all, but all the cool stuff is flat and uninteresting. They really had a chance to have a good 3D film here, but blew it.My advice - don't waste the cash!Cheue"
2,No special features,"Hi I love movies with special effects but I have to buy the Blu Ray to see them. I enjoy the ""Making of "" as much as the movie and I am so disappoined that there is only an added scene I believe. To make a movie about all special effects and not include how they did them is a disgrace. Sorry just my opinion."
2,Basicly A ONE NITE STAND TYPE OF FILM,"This is one of those movies where you watch it one time and you never want to see it again. The best part of the movie was when they fought the giant creature that came out the ocean. One cool part I like is when the gods were watching over the world,the special effects were not bad either. Overall I think these type of new age films with the special computer effects are movies you just watch one time and thats it."
3,misuse of closeups and mumbling by Liam Neeson and Voldemort really detract from the viewing experience,"This movie is totally different from the original Harry Hamlin movie so it's important to just separate from nostalgia and loyalty to give this film a fair shake. But the mistakes in camera closeups and the mumbling of Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are irritating. Also, wearing a beard while mumbling as both these actors do give the effect of chewing on dryer lint. I need closed captioning to follow this film so I can't imagine this was a pleasant movie theater experience. I found this movie unwatchable but I get the message that the Greeks used mythology as an evolutionary tool to inspire literacy, imagination and moral foundation. Once society had reached an aspirational plateau, these myths/gods were no longer necessary for daily life and just became Beautiful Stories for Children (not just the Ugly ones as authored by Dan Sweetman.)"
1,Very bad 3d movie,I purchased this move because I love 3d veiwing. The 3d in this move is almost noexistant.The movie itself was OK but the 3d portion is beyond weak. I bought this movie thinking the 3d effectswould be great seeing the different monsters it had in it but you had to stain to see any 3d effects.None worth even mentioning. If you want to see this movie just buy the bluray version and save your self money and aggravation of trying to fine and good 3d in it. I just want to say I have bought many items on Amazon and have always been happy with there service. It is not there fault this movies 3d sucks.
2,Poor Bubo,"Overall the movie wasn't bad. I loved the original Clash of the Titans movie, so the complete overhaul of the plot was a bit hard to swallow. That being said, the acting was okay and the special effects were well done, if not a bit over the top.I would have given this move three stars if it weren't for how they treated Bubo. Poor Bubo."
2,3-What???,"I loved this movie and I really thought that it would look awesome in 3-D, so I purchased it. Wow! So unimpressed with the 3D. We actually took it out and put in Wrath of the Titans, and man, what a difference. When something is really supposed to be in 3D, you can tell. Clash, I'm afraid has dissappointed me greatly. Depth and quality of 3D is very important. The 3D in this is flat and distorted. 3D features that are supposed to fly out at you become distorted and digitally grainy. What a shame because it had such awesome potential. If you want a great 3D movie, get Wrath of the Titans. That will make you say, Whoa. Anyone who writes that this version isn't too bad obviously has not indulged in marvelous 3D films on a 65"" flat screen in the comfort of their own home or something, because they are dead wrong. I feel let down by the 3D. Awesome movie though."
2,Meh...,"I didn't really care for this movie at all. It didn't have as much action as I expected, it actually seemed kinda slow and boring. I had a hard time following the story, too. And I didn't care for any of the characters. It was just... Meh... -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,Abolute rubbish!!,"WOW, I am so glad I only spent $1 at a Red Box vending machine to see this. It is terrible. No story, stunted acting, cartoon CGI. Give me the original any day. This was a classic example of the film makers thinking all they needed to do was throw a bunch of money at the screen and it would be a success...A total waste of time..."
4,nice adaptation,Good movie to watch and own if you like this type of genre. Nice adaptation of the old version - but if you were looking for a remake of the old Harry Hamlin versionClash of the Titans [Blu-ray] this is not it so don't expect it. Nice action and CGI scenes - don't focus on the acting so much as the overall plot and general story line and you should enjoy the flick!
2,I like the movie but not the 3D (based on theatre experience),"I own this on Blu-Ray and enjoy the actual film BUT I saw this in ""3D"" in the theatre and the effects weren't very clear and the picture quality kind of sucked.Honestly it looks BETTER on Blu-Ray. MAYBE the 3D Blu-Ray looks better than the theatre but I wouldn't risk paying the extra money for this title.I am a fan of 3D movies, I thought the effects in How to Tame A Dragon & Resident Evil were amazing."
4,chad,This is a decent enough movie. I bought this because we bought a 3D TV and we had seem all the other movies.
2,Disappointed Me!,"The Perseus in the original movie was more of a hero than in the new movie. In the new movie, Perseus was simply bent on revenge -- I could just never care for the guy. A hero cares about the living -- but he was bent on revenge for the dead. That really sums it up for me -- I really don't need to say more.I will add that the 3D version really let me down. It was converted to 3D in post-production (originally shot in 2D). The 'technology' they use just doesn't do it for me! I love 3D movies, but I don't care for this post-production junk they keep dishing out. I think even the new 'Narnia' movie was converted to 3D in post-production, although the results were somewhat better. If the results just don't look right, people will notice -- and it will bother them just like it bothers me!In the new 'Clash of the Titans' movie, the special effects were excellent, but that's about the best thing I can say for it."
1,A very poorly made movie,"A very poorly made action movie.Utter Nonsense. Everything, from acting to story to action sucks."
1,very dissapointed!!!!,"If they would have stuck with the original story line it would not have been so bad(maybe. But I was very dissapointed, there version made no since. The original may have been campy but it way better than this mess!!!"
2,WOW.. Not so good!! :(,"Hey everyone, This movies was not good... Alot of action at times.. so that was ok.. but even in the action.. I found my mind wardering.."
1,UGH!!,"This movie was absolutely terrible!! It you want to watch a good movie that involved Greek mythology watch 300, or even Percy Jackson was better then this!!!"
4,Clash,"Thought this movie was done very well the special effects where great, presentation of the story seem accurate and was worth the money spent and really enjoyed watching it."
2,WATCH THE ORIGINAL,In comparison to the original about the only thing going for this one are the special effects. There were some plot holes in the tale and story pieces didn't connect well. I'd watch the original and skip this one unless you are totally into Greek Mythology or need an excuse for a blood and guts picture because there are a lot of blood and guts scenes. WHEN WATCHED: 9/16/2010; MY GRADE: C plus (B minus if you fit the two categories listed).
1,Fake 3d effects + Shallow characters + Quick and Jerky Fighting Scenes,"The first disappointment with this movie is the fake 3D effects. They looked like scenes cut out of cardboard then put one behind another to create virtual depth. It's terrible. It was actually shot in 2D then ""magically"" transferred to 3D to cash in on the 3D fever.The second disappointment was the characters were shallow. The ones in the original 1980 script moved me with their depth and human feelings. Of course the special effects of the '80 movie were laughable.The fighting special effects of this film were a mixed bag. In one hand, it's very impressive. For example, the giant scorpions looked scary, and real. On the other it's disturbingly disappointing because the fighting were filmed so quickly and jerkily I could hardly saw what were happening.In short, it's a waste of my money."
2,Save your money. Buy the original.,Its not worth the price of admission. Buy the original and see how it was suppose to be.
3,"Good Movie, bad 3D effect","I bought it for the 3D effects but I was very disappointed by the 3D effects, if any. I would think that with the use of the CGI in this movie, the 3D effects would be great. It seems that the only 3D effect is during the conversations where each character would walk by one another. None of the action scenes seem to have any 3D effect. The movie itself was good but the 3D effect was nonexistent."
3,much better in blu ray 3d than 2d,"I 1st saw this in 2d and didn't like it,I compared it to the original and just didn't like it.However I recently purchased the blu ray 3d version and after the 1st half hr or so,when Perseus began his quest to kill Medusa,secure her head,so he could kill the Kracen,the action,good but not great 3d,combined with all the creatures he encountered made it a interesting 3d journey."
2,3D???,"I bought the 3D version of this movie about a month ago and I had been saving it for the right moment to watch it. I had already seen the 2D version and thought it was an okay movie... not the best, but entertaining. After watching other movies on the same level, I realized that 3D makes some movies more enjoyable. Not this one. For the first half of the movie the 3D didn't even seem to be working. There was a couple times when I thought about placing the 2D disc in and finishing the movie that way because the 3D version wasn't worth wearing the glasses for 2 hours. So far, this is the worst 3D movie that I've seen. It didn't help that I had just watched Immortals right before it which was much better in 3D. I really didn't like that film in 2D and though 3D didn't make the story better, it was a visually stunning work of art that I couldn't turn off. Anyways, stay away from this one. Luckily I bought mine on sale and it included the Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital Copy."
1,Surprisingly bad.,"It wasn't a surprise this movie was bad, it was surprising just how bad it could be. The script seemed like it was written by a 13 year old, and the direction is ridiculous. To say it's stupid is such an understatement. How does a wooden boat sink? How does a sword stick into a marble column? How does a knife sever a 2 foot thick stalactite? They turned a hero into a grumpy juice-head, they threw in a gratuitous ""strong female character,"" and the so called story is the minimum amount of dialog to string together over the top, silly fight scenes.Supporting actors did a good job acting their parts, but when your part is written like crap, directed like crap, and edited to be a steamy pile of crap it doesn't help that they have strong supporting actors (many of which have about three lines).Don't watch this movie. All it will do is upset and disappoint you."
3,The 3D SFX Makes it Better than the Original,"The first version of Clash of the Titans didn't register much on the films to remember meter other than the fine cast; Sir Lawrence Oliver and Sussanah York, wasn't supported by much of a plot, and frankly this one didn't either; however it is better in the sense of better special effects and the the 3D was superb. I bought this 3D Blu Ray to simply check out my new LG 55 inch 3D TV. It didn't disappoint in that respect. This film also has a fine cast, Sam Worthington, Liam Neissen, and Ralph Fiennes. There were a few tweaks to the plot which did make this film better than the original. I will watch it again, though not right away."
5,"Another remake, but good 3D effects","The story of old, renewed. Even the 'ol metal owl has a cameo. The 3D is pretty darn good, compared to many other movies - and quite a bit of it. Not just a few minutes throughout the movie."
2,I needed more,This Movie should have been so much better!!! It seemed to me that whoever paid to make this movie ran out of money and rushed what should have been a 3hrs movie into one that was over just as fast as it started.. The lead actor wasnt that great and did the movie a terrible injustice.. I was so looking forward to this movie only to be let down every step of the way.
5,clash ofthe titans,great action packed movie love the ancient greek era a well put together movie with excellent actors I highly recommend watching this
1,Not Even Liam,"Not even Liam Neeson can save this dismal tale set in Ancient Greece in the time of the gods. To fair, it's not Neeson's fault that he has such horrible storytellers - an even worse director and special effects that are so painfully obvious, you feel like you are watching a computer game rather than a major motion picture. I have all the respect in the world for the leading actors of the cast but this is just such a monumental waste of time. You can't care about the main characters much less the villains, the sense of danger is laughable and the single redeeming feature of this entire film is 'release the Kraken!!!'"
2,"OK movie, sucky blu ray setup","The movie itself was fairly entertaining. It wouldn't win any awards granted, but I purchased it primarily for the special effects to test out my new blu ray player.I'm primarily rating this movie so low out of aggravation with the blu ray disc setup. First off, I had to sit through the previews without being able to skip ahead to the title menu. Not a big deal on the first time around, but I shouldn't have to sit through them every time I load up the disc. If I ever decide to watch it again, my first thought will probably be ""Do I want to sit through all those previews again?"" It is possible to fast forward through these one by one, but again that is a pain.The other complaint I have is the lack of chapters in the menu. That means skipping ahead is nowhere near as easy as it should be. Lots of fast fowarding through previous scenes. It brought me back to the days of VHS."
4,The old one is better but this isn't bad,It was entertaining for me as I enjoy these type of movies. I liked the actions scenes and special affects. Still prefer the old version..don't ask me why but I do.
4,Good movie,I loved the original so i wanted to see the updated one- Action packed and good movie for the price!
3,was OK,"CGI and action was good, but story was just OK. Character developementof of the different gods or the main guy didn't work for me. Good for mindless fun."
1,not worth it in 3d,"This movie is great but don't buy the 3d version, I couldn't tell any differance than the regular blu-ray. If you wan't 3d buy alice in wonderland or resident evil afterlife, both are awesome in blu-ray 3d."
2,total bollocks,"Im afraid as much as the films graphics and sound were a work of brilliance. Unfortunetly Sam Worthington's abilities as an actor are non existant.How this guy keeps getting work is beyond me? The only convincing act he does is of a man with no talent. Why they thought a neanderthalic Australian accent would pass as a Greek demi-god is beyond conception. so I say this film is Bollocks.Sam Worthington's acting is as bad as my spelling, and thats saying something."
2,Too many previews,"I know a movie shouldn't be rated for anything other than the story itself, but the blu-ray disc forces you to watch close to 10 minutes of advertisements before the movie starts. There is no way to access the menu and bypass the ads!The movie is not too bad....there were some holes in the plot development, but the CGI effects were good."
1,Worthless,I've resisted the temptation to waste my time enumerating the incredibly long list of shortcomings with this movie. There were one or two interesting ideas or visuals which I also won't bother to list because they weren't capitalized on. This is one of those rare experiences that can only be summed-up with the phrase 'WTF!?'.
3,A mixed pot,"This is a remake with a twist.A good remake as far as remakes go.As usual, it had it's pros and cons compared to the original:Pros - The Medusa Scene IS the best scene in the movie, the action scenes were better, I liked that they changed the end, giving a hint that more's to come. I liked the black pegasus, and that they showed more of them, like he's one of many.Cons - The scorpions were dull but funny at the same time, the witches were the ugliest, nastiest witches I have ever seen.One thing I hate, is that the only action we got from the gods were that of Hades and Zues.I expected to see more action with the gods.Very disappointed with that.They're just standing around doing nothing....The trailers lead me to think otherwise...One thing is for sure Sam has to buff up a bit for the next movie."
3,Rent It Don't Buy It,"The special effects was great, the story line suck. It didn't sticked to Greek mythology like the original Clash of the Titans. If you're going to do a remake of any movie then make it better than the first, but don't mess with the story line. This movie should have been release to the SyFy channel not the theaters."
2,just dumb......,one of the bigges surprises of the year to me.it is so simple-minded and dumb that any 3 year oldcould have come up with a better story......this must get one award for sure:dumbest dialoques ever
1,Complete train wreck,"I also watched and loved the original Clash of the Titans, and, I really wanted to like this adaption. unfortunately, it relied almoste entirely on special effects, and fell far short on story telling. They not only ruined a great story, but the characters were so unlikeable, that you didn't care if they succeeded or not. Whoever was responsible for this adaptation, fell far short. If you have not ever seen the originaly, I highly recommend it."
2,Titans is just a lot of dumb fun,"If you want to enjoy watching Clash of the Titans, do yourself a favor and check your brain at the door.If you sit down to this movie with any expectations beyond seeing a bunch of pretty people dressed as gladiators battle a seemingly endless series of computer generated monsters you are bound to be disappointed.[...]"
1,Clash of the Titans,"THIS MOVIE SUCKSI will say that the Special Effects are Great , BUT THAT ALL THAT WAS!! The movie is missing all that you cared about for the First Film, Go back and see the 1981 film its 100 X Better"
3,Clash of the Titans,"A number of reviewers gave this version of Clash of the Titans a bum review because of it's departure from the older, more ""accurate"" version. However, just check your brain and enjoy the ride, especially in 3D. It's and enjoyable adventure story providing you are not expecting too much from it. Hey, just relax and be entertained for a change!Dave"
1,A worthless piece of dungpile,"I grew up with the original and have always appreciated the originality of the characters as well as the stop-motion animation that went into making the original film. This new version has crappy acting, a crappy story, and worst of all, the props and costumes look like they were just rolled off the assembly line of a movie studio out to make a quick buck. For the new generation of movie-goers that have yet to experience this film as it once was, this new movie version might provide some short form of entertainment but will soon be forgotten as soon as it is watched. If you want the real experience (minus the cheap CG effects that add nothing to the story or quality) get the original Clash of the Titans and see it as it should be."
1,"""Crash"" of the Titans.",This movie very much disappointed. My wife and I went to see this excited of what we were about to see. Unfortunately we seen it in 3D. What a headache it gave me. I couldn't wait for it to be over and go home.Story line was lame. Not like the original. Those who say it was can't be familiar with the original. Worst movie I've seen all year thus far.
2,Disappointed,"I loved the classical clash of the Titans ,so when i heard of a remake i said !wow! this should be good. Unfortunetly this did not live up to my expectations . The story line changed some what from the original in my opionion, and develop way to fast. tHE Graphics are okay but all in all a huge disppointment to me."
3,3D Movie,Recently bought 3D TV. Have been enjoying it with 3D movies. This was a fun movie. Would have liked more of the out of TV effects.
2,Sadly diappointed.,"Having loved the original film, campy as it was, I was looking forward to this new take on the story, but with marginal special effects and a bizarre interpretation of both mythology and the original screenplay, this was movie was a massive disappointment.It had an illogical tangled mess of a plot, wooden performances, and an oppressive score. This film was entirely humorless and took itself far to seriously.I guess that's a couple of hours I'll never get back. : ("
2,Clash of the 80's Hair Band,"Having enjoyed the original back when it came out, I was keen to see the remake with potentially stunning graphics. I was quite disappointed with the CGI effects. The scorpion battle scenes were murky and claustrophobic. The only bright spot, image-wise, was the Medusa battle; a glimpse of what the whole movie should have looked like. The Kraken - yawn. In summary - stick with the original, or avoid both altogether. Oh yeah, and how do you make Liam Neeson look like an 80's hair band outcast."
1,Holy cow,"This was bad. I was fully expecting this to be one of my favorite movies of the year. They did almost nothing right. I mean, all they really had to do was take the original 1980 script, excise Bubo and change some of the language then re-shoot the thing with better special effects. But instead, they changed things around and came out with a bad script, virtually no character development, and the one thing they did brilliantly - updating the special effects and monsters - they shot in such a haphazard and jerky fashion that you never got a chance to really see it. The first sign that 2010 was going to be a really bad year for movies."
2,Not good enough,It's very horrible when watching a movie and as an audience not feel any connection or even care about the characters and this is what happened to me with this movie. I just found myself truly not caring if Perseus made it alive to the end and even when his friends were being killed it was really like when is the Kraken showing so this movie can be over. The original oneClash of the Titans (Keepcase)has nothing on this one with special effects but the characters come alive and you care about their troubles and tribulations. This new version felt like it was just made to have the mythological creatures come alive in a new grand fashion with special effects thrown around but regrettably the storyline as well as the characters were lost. I recommend the first version with its second rate special effects which to tell the truth are really not that bad considering that it was made in 1981 you will get your moneys worth.
3,Clash is right.,It was ok for a night without expectation. This movie just didn't do it for me. I will keep it for another night to watch when nothing else seems to fit. Not that this movie would. But it was better than watching fuzz on the screen.
2,Too dumb for words,"But then again you're not watching this movie for its great dialog. COTT is a fun movie and it does have some fine battle scenes. All other characters are basically expendable with the exception of Ralph Finnes who does a super job as Hades. This is a weak movie as far as plot goes. The plot, what there is of it, is hard to follow and the characters are mysteries and not well defined.Having said that the scene with Medusa is very enjoyable and is a great battle scene. But sadly, this version pales in comparison to the original with Harry Hamlin. Camp will always beat out bad!"
2,Not an improvement,"The only saving grace for this movie (and the only reason I didn't give it one star) is the special effects. Everything else is pretty bad. I saw the original when I was a kid and (based on what I can remember), I think the original was better (and the original wasn't that good). This movie is not an improvement and not worth the money.Not recommended."
1,horrible,I wanted to cry with despair at the cruel waste of a prime opportunity.Get the classic from the 1980s starring Harry Hamlin and smile.
1,Awful Purchase--I want the American Version!!,"Why would I want a Japanese/Chinese version of this movie if I didn't request it? This I was totally shocked that someone would do something like this without informing you. If I missed it, then that's my error..even then, that makes no sense to do this to someone and try to get away with it. Shame on the seller.I have always purchased movies from this website, never a non-American version...ever."
2,Shorty,"Hi: Movie BuffsThis is a remake of a classic. The adventure is there and the effects do not disappoint, but it is a bit too short! This film leaves you wondering if they had a chance to finish it. It just leaves you wanting more of the story and adventure. This movie is a rental not a purchase item."
3,Nice Version,"I thought they did a fairly good job of remaking the movie. I enjoyed it, but (stupid as this sounds) the lead actor's extremely short hair ruined the movie. It did not fit in with the fantasy of that period."
1,So much worse than the original,"Wow, not even sure where to begin. This movie was so bad I couldn't even finish watching it and I really enjoyed the original. The writers of this piece of garbage felt the need to completely change major elements of the story, the origin of characters and even which god is angered by comparing Cassiopea's beauty to that of Aphrodite. Yet another remake of a 70's-80's film that pales in comparison to the original. Even though the Harryhausen effects of the original were dated they worked better than the CGI in the update. If you are a fan of the original, don't waste your time and unless you are a fan of worthless drivel you will hate this lemon that jumps the shark in the first 5 minutes."
3,"If you don't have high expectations, this is entertaining","Why do film school geeks constantly try to make every film live up to their unrealistic expectations? Anyone with half a brain should know based on watching the previews that Clash of the Titans was going to be a CGI soup with not much else. If you're willing to except that, then you will enjoy this movie.If you're hoping for Goodwill Hunting meets 300 then you better grow up and realize that some films are made for pure entertainment and action. This is one of them, and I'm fine with that. Keep your expectations low, enjoy the CGI and action, and you'll enjoy the film.If you're too pretentious to do that, they you should pass."
3,Decent flick,"Movie had adequate action scenes and a catchy overall plot. I wish that there was less of the ""under dog"" trend. Overall I liked it."
3,Could be a little longer,It Waz an ok movie but I thought it wasn't long enough..... It could of done better with a longer ending but still a pretty good mivie
4,First Blu-Ray... Can't go wrong.,Just bought a new home theatre system and I bought this Blu-ray to go along with it. Great epic movie. Must have!
4,Good Popcorn Movie,"I guess I don't understand the haters of this film. This was a fun pop-corn movie. You will always have the students of mythology hating anything that isn't verbatim to their gods and you will have those who hate anything re-made.Clash of the Titans is the story of Perseus, a son of Zeus, who must kill the kraken before it destroys some humans.Starring Sam Worthington as Perseus, Liam Neeson as Zeus (and really who else has the voice of a god?), and Ralph Fiennes as Hades, this film is as entertaining as any summer blockbuster.You have a group of men fighting giant scorpions, trying to take the head of Medusa, and riding a flying horse.The special effects are great. Go along for the ride and enjoy spectacle.It will be interesting to see what they do for the sequel and I think I'd like to go back and watch the original because the effects they used for that movie was state-of-the-art at the time.Don't listen to the haters, this is a decent movie."
4,Clash of the Titans,Better than the original although technology both on the filming and the viewing end may have helped. Much more engaging than the first filem.
1,UGG!,"Mythology or hyperbole?! More of the latter and very little of the first! This mess is really pushing it. The special effects were indeed ""special"" and effects but...yuck! Loved the eyeless hairy covered skulls with them coveting a large super-intelligent talking eyeball on the end of a clump of vines that they were tossing around. OH...and if you like your heros galumping about with hairy legs and a mini-skirt...this is your movie. What a waste!!!"
4,Clash of the Titans,"I compared it to the original. Of course, this one a lot different than the original. It was entertaining. My 22 and 15 year old boys love it."
4,Good movie,My son was doing some assignments for school relating to Greek mythology and we just ordered this movie on amazon tv it was a great break and helped out with my sons studies
2,All that money - for what?,You've seen the jokes about swords and short skirts on youtube. You will probably enjoy the film if you're a male between ten and twenty-five.
3,I Flunked Classics Class,I went into this flick without any point of reference. Mythology used to put me to sleep in college with this god begetting this god and the nonesuch. I was just looking for a good popcorn movie and for the most part this remake fit the bill. Liam Neeson as Zeus is pretty much in paycheck mode and Ralph Fiennes chews the scenery as Hades. The effects are pretty good and they service the story to a point. Final verdict it has a good beat and I could dance to it so on a scale of one to ten I give it a six.
3,Clash of the Titans Blue Ray,"Received DVD promptly. Watched the movie, great special fx. It did freeze for a couple of seconds part way through."
4,Clash of the titans,"I found it was told differantly from the 1981 version that I have, yet it it quite good in it's own way. Only because of it's special afects, but it is still wearth having in your collection."
3,"Solid action, rushed ideas","Title says it all, some great ideas here, just rushed when it came down to filming them. With a sequel announced lets hope they can improve."
3,Remake falls short of what made the original good,"The original ""Clash of the Titans"" contained a story that made you feel good and brought Greek mythology to life. This version of ""Titans"" strips away all that was good about the first one, leaves you with characters that you care nothing about, and capitalizes on what was lacking in the original - the special effects. Worth a look, but George Lucas once said something like ""Special effects without a story is not much of a story"". Exactly."
2,Clash of the So-So,"This movie was basically a hacked up version of the 1980 classic with overdone CGI imagery. The CGI looked too cartoony. Many scenes seemed rushed. No style in them at all.Such as the stygian witches scene.They get their answers some weak dialogue and that's it.I liked in the original how the witch raises her first and screams ""A Titan against a Titan!""It had emotion and gust.The acting in this movie was weak and drab.Movies like this rely too much on special effects.Medusa looked too cartoony and did not have the creep factor like the original.The kraken looked too generic and had no unique qualities to it. Also looked cartoony.Sam Worthington reprises his role as the tough guy who grunts lines and that's it.Like the movie, no style, no innovation, no emotion.In sum, this movie was basically an overdone CGI blah-fest.The design and effect for Hades was the only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of one.Hades was the only character where the CGI worked and looked effective."
4,Clash of the Titans Blue Ray,"It's a great movie that stand on its own. Unlike other so called ""remakes"" this is one is different enough from the original to be considered its own Movie. So if you're expecting the same sappy Love story from the original, this version will have surprises waiting for you."
1,"really? almost as bad as ""Planet of the Apes""!",not even close to the original.didn't make much sense...SO effects heavy that it deletes all connection to the actors...just dumb.
2,Stupid in Comparison with It's Kind,"Clash of the Titans is an overally stupid movie with neither the story or good special effects to match wits with its other fantasy movie counterparts, such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc. In a LOTR type fashion this is an adventure story involving a group of characters out to perform a mission, which I forget. Liam Neeson plays the ""God"" character (who is pretty screwed up himself), but never really does much for the story. Scenes are flat, dialogue is profoundly stupid, the musical score is elementary, and it has one of the stupidest endings in history.This is just bad overall, no need to go into details. People these days think they can just toss a bunch of special effects in and they're set. The only thing redeeming about this flick was the main character's hot mom."
4,Clash of the Titans 1st,"Learning about Perseus that he had no idea who his real parents were until events came!!! He found out the whole truth about his birth and who he was.. Watch this movie Clash of the Titans first before you watch next movie Wrath of the Titans.. ROOTING FOR PERSEUS (Sam Worthington, Actor)!!!!"
5,I love it,I love this movie. There is alot of action in it and it doesnt just drag on. The bad well was the training part of the movie after the begaing
4,I really liked this remake.,"I saw the original and liked it very much. But I like this one much better, a better story with a little more in-depth of the character's. The special effects were very good,mind you nothing to Harry Hausen. This had a story and action to watch. Not Oscar material by no means."
4,good action special effect's,ok so the first one has more story but this one has the best especial effects no clay monsters. i think the movie is good yes they could have made it better but is still a good action movie
5,Great Movie,This movie was great.It had alot of actionIt had great special effects.I would recommend this movie.
1,One star is being generous.,"This movie is bad. Bad casting, bad acting, bad script, and bad direction. Even the special effects are bad! If you are a fan of movies like Sahara, National Treasure, and Prince of Persia then this movie is for you. Otherwise, stay far away from this uninspired, dull, soulless remake. Apart from the obvious flaws you notice immediately into the film, the most disappointing is that this movie takes away all the charm the original Clash of the Titans had. A perfect example is Bubo, the mechanical owl who helps Perseus in the first film. He served as a R2D2 type character providing comic relief as well as being a guide for the hero. In this movie, Perseus notices Bubo on a pile of junk and picks him up and asks ""What is this?"". In response, he is told to ""leave THAT behind"". He is then tossed back onto the pile of junk with a shrug. Enough said."
5,Fantastic,"I must say that I have every kind of movie there is and love the original version of Clash of the Titans. This was a very good remake and very entertaining with the visual and special effects. I enjoy it very much, this was a great purchase for me. The characters were great especially Sam Worthington, which did a great job in Avatar. This is a very enjoyable movie."
2,The worst remake ever made,This movie brings to life one of the many greek mythology stories. I hated the fact that they did not keep up with the events that were told regarding the storie behind Clash of the Titans. This version took many liberties and as I always say why mess with the classics. If you want the real story as passed down from generation to generation watch Clash of the Titans made in the late 1980's. Schniggles
2,Nothing about Titans,"Yup...and a lousy Medusa! And IO being in love with Perseus??! Anyway, enjoy it if you like Worthington's strong sexy thighs."
3,b-ray o.k. DIGITAL COPY INSTALL PROBLEMS,"good ""guy flick"" lots of over the top action...good remake of original classic IMO. digital copy forces you to install adobe download installer which failed on my win XP dell PC. good luck on gettting help ""within 5 working days"" from warner bros. not my first bad experience with WB digital download"
2,"What's with the ""small picture"" on my screen?","I ordered this for rent last night from my Sony XBR9 TV. What's with the small picture on my screen? There are thick black bars on all sides of the picture, and the movie takes place in a small area in the center. It was hard to see what was happening in the movie since the picture was small.My TV operates normally when viewing satellite, but this movie does not take advantage of the area on my screen."
3,"Not a bad movie. Good special effects, so-so story line","If I could give this 3 1/2 stars I would. But there is no 1/2 stars for rating so I gave it a three. I feel that is a fair judgement. I really enjoyed the special effects of when the scorpions attack, when Perseus and the other soldiers go into Medussa's temple, and the ride across the river Styx and Charon the ferryman, well I like this version of him. Now for the story...Great potential that falls short. The lead actors and actresses do a great job with the script that was given. From Liam Neeson(Zeus) to Sam Worthington (Perseus) whois helpless to save his family from Hades (Ralph Fiennes), god of the underworld to Gemma Arterton (IO) the woman who watches, not a complaint on the acting. The script however runs the basic same old story. I don't like the special effects of the Krakon. The movie thought that the more the monster the better. Not in this case. This isn't a bad movie to watch on a cloudy and rainy day."
2,If you want 3D I'd look elsewhere,"So I am not a huge fan of this movie, but I bought it in 3D because frankly there aren't too many adult 3D movies out yet. I haven't even used the 3DTV all that much for movies, so when I bought this I was at first furious at my TV thinking the 3D feature is just a waste of time. After I watched about half of this piece of crap I popped in Yogi Bear 3D and it was about 1000x better as far as visuals go. If you like this movie and if you don't mind darker crappy 3D then I'd pick this up. Otherwise stay away. I even resold mine, and I never resell anything. I was that upset with the purchase."
4,"MYTHOLOGY GETS SERIOUSLY KICKED TO THE CURB, BUT...","The plot is a bit more than thin in CLASH OF THE TITANS. The 'heroes' are petty, and pouting, and the 'gods' are only interesting because of the actors that are portraying them ( especially Fienes as Hades ). However, the CGI is great, and the only time it's not fun to watch is when the majority of the characters are opening their mouths instead of hacking at monsters. Anyone that seriously anticipated that this remake of the less-than-classic 1981 fantasy of the same name would be anything other than an action-packed, visually pleasing head-rush of a popcorn pic will be seriously disappointed. If you're looking for accuracy in a mythological context, or acting on a par with Tracey, or March in INHERIT THE WIND you won't be happy either."
3,Fun despite its inconsistencies.,"My son and I enjoyed the movie. Sure, it didn't follow the mythology to a tee, but we took it for what it was...entertainment. My son has read all of the Percy Jackson books, and he noticed the disparity in legend. But he enjoyed the action, and didn't really care that the costumes didn't measure up. Go figure. It's worth watching, especially with a kid. As an adult, you may find your interest waning, but as long as your child finds pleasure in it what more can you ask for?"
4,CLASH ROCKS AGAIN,"NOTHING WILL EVER BEAT THE ORIGINAL,BUT CLASH STILL ROCKS IN MY OPINION!I DONT QUITE UNDERSTAND PERCEUSES ATTITUDE ABOUT ACCEPTING HIS GIFT OF BEING A DEMIGOD,BUT IF YOU CAN GET PAST THAT THE STORY MOVES ALONG VERY WELL,I LIKED IT ALOT!GREAT MOVIE WATCHING EXPERIANCE."
2,Crammed,"They tried to cram too much into too little time and this really made the story seem forced. Some things also didn't make any sense. How, for example, did a fisherman transform into a sword swinging warrior over-night? This would have been a much better movie if it was thirty minutes longer which would have allowed things to develop."
4,Clash of the Titans,It is rare that I like a re-make of a movie but this version I actually prefer over the original. I think that's so because of the more technological advances with special effects. I remember seeing the original and being blown away by the special effects then. Comparing both though you can see how the original now looks like some kind of puppet show.
1,Disjointed and uninspiring!,"A big dissappointment, unlike the original and not as good as the original. Basically a mindless story with no direction or explanation of what is happening. At least the first one told a story and you understood who Perseus was and what the whole purpose of the movie was. In this one...there was no explanation, no accurate narration, and no purpose to the movie. Friends of mine who saw it and didn't see the original first, didn't understand it at all."
4,"Better than the first, but still not a classic","The original Clash of the Titans is perhaps mostly remembered for its sheer corniness. This remake by the same name is certainly better and has amped up special effects. On the whole, I'd give it 3.5 stars. The movie does some things very well, such as the monsters. Medusa looks great and perfectly combines beauty and horror. Yet, I can't help but think that the directors wasted this opportunity to make a truly classic movie. Clash of the Titans falls into the trap of many modern movies in packing nearly every scene with intense battles or special effects. The movie's pacing rarely slows down enough to develop the characters or expand its emotional range beyond pure adrenaline. Also, some characters seem out of place. Who exactly are the Jin? As it stands, Clash of the Titans is certainly worth watching, but didn't manage to reach is full potential."
4,"Awesome, Epic Fantasy!",Clash of the Titans is really good. The only problem I had with it was the 3D. The movie was made for 2D and they should have kept it that way. I am really looking forward to the Blu-Ray so I can see it on my home theater in 2D. I really hope this 3D fad blows over quick.The movie is a modern update of a great 1980's Ray Harryhausen flick. I found the battle with the Giant Scorpions to be most exhilerating. The pegasus was dead-on. Medusae was mean as hell and the Kraken was HUGE. Great acting and set pieces. Story could have been a little better but overall a great time! Bring on Clash 2!
1,Not what I thought it was,"I bought this for my boyfriend and I though it was a metal face plate,like all the ones I've seen in stored, which it what he really wanted, however, it's a sticker.He said it didn't even fit properly, he had to cut it."
4,Solid,"This is a very solid piece by arguably the best ""jazz/fusion/rock"" bassist of all time........add funk as well, I am not the biggest jazz fan but was originally drawn to Stanley by his fusion works of the mid to late 70's. He is surrounded here by an allstar lineup, very nice....and guess what? He's playing some old standards that are tried and true, but like any artist each offering is invariably different and to me that is a good thing. He has taken a beating in so many reviews for ""not matching his early works"". Do NOT forget his career survived the 80's, an era where most musicians ""gave in"" order to continue on while keeping the record company people happy in a pop culture we look back at with loathing. Stanley like all musicians grew and his sound changed, sometimes we don't like the change but that's life, he's not gonna crank out a ""Life Suite"" or ""Rock'N'Roll Jelly"" on every disc. If you don't own his early discs, GET THEM!!!"
4,Too Attention-Getting for Background Music,"I've tried to play this as background music, but the musicianship and song selection always make me pay attention. I would never have believed that Najee was so wonderful, though I expected pretty much what we get from Stanley Clarke, Billy Cobham, the wonderful Larry Carlton, and Deron Johnson.I'm a guitar nut but somehow I don't end up wandering off when Larry finishes his solo breaks. I get pulled in by Najee and Johnson's work just as much.I would consider this well-worth buying if you like jazz or just like to hear instruments played by a tight group of masters. You *probably* can listen to it while doing other things, but I would warn against it."
5,Great seller / Great product,"Quick shipment, excellent product for reasonable price. Pleasure to do business with."
5,Ait Filter,It is an air filter. How much can I say? It cleans the air before it reaches the engine. I am glad I put one in because I think my car should have an air filter.
5,Clean air for all,"An affordable filter for your truck/car/whatever uses this size filter.It is a great price and I have never had an issue with Fram products. I personally feel they are a great, dependable brand.Change your air filter as often as your driving environment calls for. Though 2 years or 20,000 miles is a good general rule-of-thumb."
1,Good idea bad implementation!,I am not too keen to IDEs writing my code. They often lead to sloppy code that lead to very generic-looking applications. But sometimes they are helpful to do quick & dirty jobs fast. The big problem with this package is a lack of documentation. The 67 page Users' Guide is so insufficient that it only explains how to use on two of the many components the package offers. Even then it does not explain the use of these components well enough for me to use them. If CodeGear expects this product to be useful they need to write an in-depth tutorial and not expect other people to try to figure out the software and write tutorials for CodeGear as has been done for Delphi and JBuilder. The product has been on the market for a short while now and nobody has written a tutorial.
2,Didn't work as expected,"I bought this antenna after researching zones online. This item was rated for all the zones I needed and I thought I would be able to pick up a minimum of five or six digital stations. I ended up with two analog and two digital. What I failed to factor in was the signal strength stations were using to transmit their signals. Even though this antenna was appropriate for zones and distances to transmission towers, it seems like it is not adequate based on signal strength. If I had better signal strength, I may have been able to give it a higher rating."
1,Do not buy from Home & Beyond,I bought a channel master 4221. It comes form Polsteins Home & Beyond. They sent me a damaged antenna. I returned it and they sent me the exact same antenna back in the exact same box. It even had the note I wrote to them in the box. They just put it back in stock and then resent it to me. A very dishonest company. I still have yet to get my money back. DO NOT BUY anything form Home & Beyond.
2,just an 'OK' antenna,"I read about this antenna on a couple sites, which recommended it as a great antenna for UHF frequencies, and not particularly directional. Unfortunately, not so for me- seems quite sensitive to direction for some channels, and doesn't have the range (even with a power amp) I'd hoped for. also - be careful who sends it to you- the one I received was pretty beat up by the time it arrived; several element were bent quite a bit out of shape, since the cardboard box it was packed in wasn't up to the task."
2,Somewhat overrated.,"I bought this on hype and the sad notion that I would mount this outside. I got it from Polstein's (stay away) and was deterred from mounting it, once I got a load of all the ""you can die"" sticker warnings. I set it up indoors without a pre amp and got diddly except, KPIX. I know it probably rocks once its in an attic sweet spot or happily on the roof, but I don't see it happening on a widescale in the future with people looking for hdtv from an ota. I found a rocking indoor antenna (RCA ANT706). I recommend finding the indoor antenna that rocks for you."
2,Channel Master 4221 Antenna,"I wasn't able to get this antenna to function very well but I think there was just too many buildings blocking the signal. My mother's house is surrounded by several high-rises and I just couldn't get the antenna high enough. I made sure it was aimed in the correct direction for best reception by using the coordinates given for her address, but still it just picked up only a very few stations. I plan to try it out at my house eventually where there are no buildings to block the signals.Also handle it with thick work gloves on. It has raw wires on all sides sticking out and they will scratch the heck out of you. I received several cuts, and one deep one since I forgot my gloves. Please don't forget to wear thick work gloves or you will most likely get injured."
5,Works great indoors!,"For fifteen years I used four-bay bow-ties like this outdoors. Eventually I decided improved analog reception wasn't worth the hassle. My last antenna was an indoor model labeled for HDTV. It worked fine for analog but not HDTV.Multipath distortion can break up digital reception even with a strong signal. The four-bay bow-tie design rejects multipath distortion pretty well. I tried one indoors. I stuck a pipe on the pedestal of a discarded office chair to make a stand that helds the antenna near the ceiling. Reception was much better.To try the antenna outdoors, I hoisted it above rooftop level and aimed it at each transmitter within 80 miles. I received 34 UHF channels (16 analog and 18 digital). Surprisingly, I get those 34 channels just as well with the antenna beside my TV. I can have my cake and eat it, too!"
1,poor quality and construction,"I would not recommend the Channel Master 4221 to anyone. The antenna was incompletely assembled and the reflector was mangled to the extent that it does not form a decent reflective surface. The reflector had also been attached to the rest of the antenna backwards. The reflector also was constructed of cheap wire mesh that does not appear to be anodized or coated to be weather-resitant. It looks like it would rust if used outdoors. It does not look anything like the photos shown here on Amazon.The antenna arrived in the manufacturer's packaging, which was in pristine condition, so it appears the damage and quality issues occurred at the factory, and the item was sent out anyway."
5,Good attic antenna,"I installed this antenna in my attic and was able to receive all digital channels from 2-66 (around 40, I think) in the SF Bay area. All channels have a 80% or more signal strength.Product arrived in time and in good shape.UPDATE: 11/09/09This antenna does NOT pickup the Hi-VHF channels. In the SF Bay area, ABC and NBC are broadcast over Hi-VHF and I am no longer able to receive them using this antenna. Bummer!"
3,This is a pretty cute book,"I found it to be very entertaining, and would recommend it for young adults, but there were things that seemed to me to be out and out rip-offs of Harry Potter. Many of the names in this book were the same as characters in Harry Potter, and also some fictional characters had similiar names, or the exact same names. The boggart, for example, although he's nothing like a boggart in Harry Potter.I didn't care for her writing style as much as J.K Rowling's either, at times it felt like she was trying too hard to be funny."
3,"Good plot, poor characters","Septimus heap has a very good plot, which include treacherous caharacters, a hiden princess and a new and magikal world. But the caharcters are not that deep. This 412 guy, is supposely the most important cahacter, but he barely takes an importamt roll at the story. Its good, but not excellent, its your choice."
3,"Tis, Tis, Tis,","I thought this would be a good read becase I read her picture books to my little neghibor. I picked tis up at Borders, read the back and it sounded good. But it wasn't! At first I thought that usally long books are better, but this was not! I know this author could write better books, that aren't picture books. In some of the chapters nothing happens that goes with the story's plot. I'm very disaponted in this book, TIS TIS TIS!"
3,Good and bad,"There are things I like about the series (I've read all six), and there are things I don't. I found the plots moved along enough to keep me interested and the character development was decent. I did NOT like WORDS being BOLDED all the TIME. Also, I found too many items and devices lifted straight from Harry Potter. The name Trelawney is not common and yet she chose to lift that name. The spiral stairs that spin on their own. I don't remember others off the top of my head but I kept thinking, can she rip off Harry Potter even a little less obviously?"
3,"Fun, but shallow.","The story of Septimus Heap is powerhouse fantasy. You've got a boy wizard (who doesn't know he's a wizard!) raised very cruelly away from his true family. You've got a princess raised by paupers--both with hearts of gold. You've got a dark wizard coming back to power whom many believed to be dead. You've got a magic ring. You've got dragons. You've got talking rats. You've got a saucy barmaid and at least one castle. And you have a satisfyingly intricate back story with plenty of action. All good.What Septimus Heap is missing is character development, which makes it difficult to get very invested in the series."
5,Amazing!!! **Spoiler Alert**,"This book was great! I loved the well-developed characters and story-line, but most of all, it was the way that the magyk was portrayed. The magyk in this book was completely different from the magic in Harry Potter, seeing that in Harry Potter the magic is something that people are picked for and then taught, but in Magyk the magyk came from objects that had spells written on them. It was very different, but a good different.The only thing that I didn't like too much was that, even though you know who Septimus is during almost the entire book, it isn't until the very end that we find out for sure. It was somewhat aggravating. Also, I didn't like how the book switched from character to character.Well, I hope that this review was helpful and please, enjoy the book."
3,"Good ideas, don't like the writing","Magyk is a good story in an interesting setting. I did like the characters, especially Boy 412 and Nicko. The only thing is, the author doesn't seem to know any synonyms for ""amazed"". It gets a little repetitive, and sometimes she makes a character ""amazed"" for no reason. Alther seems like a stereotypical old wizard (Gandalf, Dumbledore). Yes, he has some things that are not the same, but it would be nice if he was not the average mentor. I also wished that we could have seen the rest of the Heaps more in the Forest, because there's not much distinction. I bought the rest of the books and enjoy the series, but I wouldn't give it five stars like I would other books. All in all, a good book for light reading."
3,And to think I didn't want to read this one,"I am in fantasy reading overload. It seems every publisher wants to have a book with boy wizards who have a greater destiny. Been there, done that. Writers should move on. And so should their editors. This book, however is a bit more original. The spells in bold face are annoying, but the story is good. It kept me engaged, and isn't that what a book is for?"
2,"Not that great, gimmics mad it irritating to read","I wanted to like this book more than I did. The author's use of gimmics such as alternate spelling, e.g. ""Magyk"", having lots of words in bold font and random capitalization were incredibly irritating and distracted from the story. A author would would have been better served by concentrating on good writing rather than clever tricks.The first part of the book was loaded with cliche similes that should have been avoided - where's the originality?The story itself was cute but the ending was too predictable and parts of the book were clear Harry Potter rip offs. Too many characters were introduced and so many sub plots were thrown in that few were developed enough and it made the book confusing to follow at times.I would skip this book and find something else."
2,Just can't get into it.,"I really wanted to get into this book, but I just couldn't! The drawings were really nice and I liked the ideas, but the first few chapters just dragged on. I don't know why so many people are comparing this to Harry Potter at all. This book holds none of the great writing or magic that HP has. HP drew me into his world from the first page. In this novel, there is a whole chapter dedicated to the characters falling down a chute, with the author switching from view point to view point every other paragraph. Ugh! I understand that this may have been written for children or young adults, but so were a lot of other books that I loved (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Narnia, Eragon, etc.). I had to stop before the halfway point."
3,"It was ok, worth reading once.","The overall story line was interesting enough to enjoy, but the writing style was.... off. I would maybe say that the writing style would be appropriate for Pre-10 year olds, as it seemed like there was nonstop.... action? The story never stopped. Look, we're going here, now look, we're over here, now look, we're doing this. I guess that is good to hold the attention of a much younger reader.. Not me though, I will NOT be buying or reading the rest of the books."
4,Great,A good start to a series. An interesting storyline and good character development. A good read for young readers who like magic.
3,Okay for youngsters,"I think it will entertain a younger set of readers than I, but it was a good book. It was a bit elementary for my tastes."
4,"Buy the paperback or hardcover, not the Kindle edition.","If I was reviewing the paperback or hardcover editions of Magyk I would give it 5 stars. The plot had me captivated and the characters are some of my all time favourites. Angie Sage's writing is wonderfully witty, and the world she has created is original and fun.Even though I already own the Septimus Heap series I decided I wanted the books on my Kindle while on holiday. The problem I have with the Kindle edition is that it doesn't include Mark Zug's brilliant illustrations. If you haven't read any of these books, and you have the choice, I'd suggest paying a little bit extra for the artwork alone."
2,This is an un-original knock-off of Harry Potter,"Not worth your while. The plot is predictable, the writing is dull and sometimes clumsy, and there are no real off-setting strengths for the book to draw upon."
5,Magyk,"This book will wow you! There is none stop adventure in this book. If you like mythicaly ceatures then you'll love to read adout the Heap family and their Magyk (magic). When one problem is solved then anoter is created. I personaly didn't like Harry Potter but this is kind of like that only better. There is a charaicter for everyone to relate to in Magyk. I am reading Flyte right now which is the second book. Angie Sage is the best author every, I think."
5,Great book!,Author Angie Sage does a great job with this book. Septimus Heap reminds me alot of Harry Potter and has a wonderful story that is easy to read and keeps the reader attentive. Highly recommend!
2,The Devil is in the details!,"This is a very poorly written book. Granted, it's auditorium is children, whose young minds may not require as much detail, but even the children deserve more than just plot bullet-points. Unfortunately, this author gives her readers just that, bullet points.The author's attempt at writing magical fantasy fiction fails. Angie Sage does have a good imagination, even if a bit trite, but unfortunately she lacks the capacity to bring her stories to life.A pity!"
4,Septimus Heap:Magyk,This is a very easy book to read. Good description of the story so you really feel like you are there.
2,Isn't it supposed to be about Septimus Heap?,"I didn't love Magyk, mostly because the story did not focus enough on Septimus. I was much more interested in Septimus than I was in the other characters. I am usually a big fan of writers who can paint with their words, as can this author. Unfortunately for me, because so much of the painting was about other characters, I became a little annoyed with what appeared to be non-essential ramblings. The ending of Magyk suggested that future books in the series would feature Septimus more, so I jumped right into the second book (which I soon thereafter put down without finishing because of the boredom that it inflicted)."
3,"A good book, but ...","It is a good book for readers of fantasy, but as one person has put it, the font type changes whenever magic is mentioned. It is a distraction more than anything else. The book has a lot of characters, and focus on them is anything but. The author doesn't seem to really let you get to know any one of the characters. Actually, it seems the book has too many characters that it becomes dizzying."
4,Visual descriptions make this book,"It took me till almost half way through to really get into this book but after that I was hooked and NEEDED the next in the series. The visual descriptions are what i enjoyed the most. The story was so creative. I thought it was going to go in a different direction till almost 400 pages but I was very please with the ending! This book is great for adults, teens, and children."
5,5 stars,"an absolutely extraordinary start to a magykal series. angie sage shows top notch work. i reccomend this book to anyone looking for an exciting novel. books 2, 3, and 4 are just the same way."
2,Boring and Predictable,"I picked this book up hoping to find something similar to Harry Potter that could fill my time while I wait for the newest one to come out. This book was EXCRUCIATINGLY bad! I am not even going to bother writing a long review. I just want to warn any adults hoping to fill there time with something while waiting for the newest Harry Potter book or even the sequel to Eragon by Christopher Paolini. This book was very childish and the plot is beyond predictable. I knew who Septimus Heap was the second I met his TRUE identity. I could see smaller children enjoying this book, but it's a little too bland for adult readers."
2,A boring and un-original kids' fantasy book,"Here is another children's book that I just could not get into at all. I read the first 75 pages, and even those were tough to get through. As a true Harry Potter fan, I found this book to be seriously missing the mark in the fantasy-magic genre. The characters were not well-written, and for me, when the characters aren't fully developed, I have a very hard time caring at all about any of them. The storyline just bored me to pieces, and a few elements seemed a little too familiar if you are an HP fan (i.e. a spiral staircase that winds its way up a tower, a character with the last name ""Trelawney""). I think kids (probably ages 8 to 11) might enjoy this book if they already like the wizard/magic fantasy genre. But this book just did not do it for me."
1,"Septimus Heap, Book One: Magyk by Angie Sage","I hated this book it was so detailed and parts of it made absolutely no sense. It was also overly detailed and with every turn of the page it seemed stupider and stupider, who like wizards and warlocks? The only book in this series I liked was The Magykle Papers it was good. I'm sorry for those of you who loved this book. Sorry >:("
3,"1800- EDITOR...Thanks, I think we have an emergency","When I first bought Magyk, I was very excited and could not await to read the tale. I read 100 pages and felt no urge to continue. If in 100 pages the author has not mentioned the protagonist, Septimus Heap....something is wrong. The Story seemed to be everlasting and seriously needed an editor. I personally have no patience, for a book of such. For those who have the patience go ahead, for those who enjoy ""to the point"" tales, don`t even open it."
2,Not on my recommended list...your choice,"If you haven't read the works of Robert Stanek, you should pick those up before reading this book (and the rest of this series). Many contemporary writers seem to take crib notes from Stanek's works, but rarely give due where they should. Start with The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches books and go on to the Service of Dragons books. You'll note similar large casts of characters, similar structures to the story, and in some cases very similar plotting."
2,Slightly disapointing,"This book was a second..........marked on the bottom wich a black marker and mis cut pages, I wish it had been advertised as such."
3,Decent start to a new series.. Decent,"I was looking for another ""Harry Potter"" type series. The indept character/plot analysis is not here and I was never intrigued until the last chapter. I don't think there ever will be another HP so I'll stop comparing the two. A lot of time is spent explaining what could be explained in half the time. The book lagged a bit in the middle due to this but picked up at the end. I was curious enough to purchase book two. I'll give Septimus another shot to wow me."
4,Fun Read,"This was a really great book! It surprised me in the way it was able to grab me from the beginning. The characters were all interesting, and the world was fairly fresh as far as fantasy worlds go. There's actually not a lot else to say, as it's a fairly simple book. It is written for children, but it is enjoyable to adults (or at least this one). The plot had a little ""surprise,"" but I figured it out a while before. That didn't take any enjoyment out. One of my favorite things was being able to get narration from many creatures. From human to shield bug, you got to see a little bit of their world. It was fantastic!One somewhat bothersome thing had to do with the words themselves oddly enough. Any word that was related to magic was bold. That could take you out of the story a bit. However, I found that to be a minor thing. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a fun story in a fascinating world."
3,Ok book,"Contrary to many of the reviewers, the book wasn't anything special and lacks the magic of Harry Potter. I was convinced by the reviews to buy this book even though I wasn't sure if I really wanted to buy it and readit. However , it is still a pageturner.I found the magic spells abd creatures to be cool. I doubt I will be buying any of the many sequels. This book is about the Heap family, whose adopted daughter is wanted dead along with them since she is the queen's daughter. The Supreme Custodian and his evil servants are hot on their trail.Towards the end of the book, we dicover who is and what has happened to Septimus Heap."
4,"Review by Allen P. Bristow, author of THE PINKERTON EYE","Foster's tale is a combination turn of the century western, romance and mystery. His attention to detail is excellent, particulary firearms, period photographic technique and geography. In a pleasant change from the usual western plot his hero, Ray Rapp, is an itinerant photographer...not a cowboy!The primary setting for the story is the Colorado Rocky Mountains, centering on Creede and Wagon Wheel Gap. This rugged country is well known to the reviewer because the conclusion of his PINKERTON EYE is set there and Foster describes it well. Finding the double eagles through a clue in the lines of an old song cleverly ties together the multiple plots at the conclusion of this interesting story."
4,A Treasure Deep by Alton L. Gansky,"I found A Treasure Deep, by Alton L. Gansky, to be a real page-turner. The concept was fresh, the story captivating, and it was truly hard to put down. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a fast-paced novel."
2,disappointed,nothing wrong with the product...but i am disappointed in the picture quality...i had a vhs bootleg of these a while back and it actually looked better
1,The Wig My Fther Wore,I really don't know what I expected when I ordered this book but I must say I am completely disappointed with the book. I did not enjoy it at all.
1,I have no idea what's going on,This novel makes no sense. Half of it is gibberish. The other half is just not worth reading. Waste of time.
1,Why Did I Buy This Book in the First Place?!,"This book was awful! I did not find any humor in it. I found the writing style to be rather elementary. I use to write short stories in a similar style when I was nineteen and had jumped on the whole mock-drepression, no-real-reason-to-be-negative, wanna-be-anti-social grunge bandwagon. I just could not get into her ""jaded character"" writing style, having outgrown it myself. I didn't see the point of the story (if there was one). I couldn't make connections (if there were any to be made). It was very free-flow, almost stream of consciousness and not interesting in the least. I am sorry I bought it and stopped reading it halfway through when I finally realized that it would not get better. The only reason why I gave it one star is because I was forced to, I was required to give it a rating in order to be able to post my review."
1,Why did I buy this?,I am sure this is suppose to be a very eclectic novel but really I can't believe what a garbled mess this was. So why did I keep reading? It is sort of like cleaning up your plate. The story had some sort of plot but the telling made little or no sense whatsoever. Some people may find it very clever but I think it just a confusion.
1,"If you prefer clear use of English, avoid this one.","I don't know what it is about today's writers; more and more the English language is being butchered through bad syntax, bizarre sentence structure and nonsensical wording. For all of those items, this book takes the grand prize.Frankly, I couldn't figure out how this book ever got through an editorial process and have come to believe that it must not have been edited at all. You will have a hard time finding a single paragraph that meets the standards of a high school English teacher, let alone the normal standards of professional writing.Although the author has a wonderful imagination and a good *idea* for a story, the writing standards presented here represent the triumph of illiteracy."
5,The short version,This book was written quite a few years ago and is just as informative now as when I first read it.This should be required reading for all H.S. children and adults alike. This is a short version of why our money sytem will eventually fail and what can be done in the future to aviod this situation again. I would reccomend this book to anyone who is brave enough to read it and face the reality of the countrys current predicament. This book is kind of hard to find but worth the effort. EXCELLENT READ.
3,Wish it had belt loops.,"Very nice, but the draw string just don't do it for me. Wish it had belt loops."
4,right yet wrong,"Now I've ordered two of these. Deliver way ahead of expectation on both orders. It's just... I ordered these both times and both times I got the Ghast ones. I don't mind really, they are just the same except for the Ghast tag. But someone else might mind so be careful."
4,Wonderful chrisitan novel,"Flame is the love story of Bacall and Rory. Bacall is just graduating from college, and lands a job at a record company. Rory becomes a big time singer, which makes Rory Jealous of all the attention he gets from other women. Bacall tries not to let lust take over her Chrisitan values, while dating Rory, but finds out that it's not always so easy. This is a good book for all people in a relationship to read."
3,The teacher - same as before,"Disk worked fine. A rather dark story with frivolous, destracting sub plot about a maniac that deminished the rather simple 'coming of age' story. Some nudity but not much, and nothing graphic like one might be looking for today."
1,DVD-R,I purchased this title based on a customer review that indicated the the item was not a DVD-R but the product I received was. This is a warning to other potential customers that you may or may not receive a DVD-R. I don't think DVD-R's should ever be sold unless the product description informs the customer that that is what they are purchasing. I have not watched the movie yet but the product gets one star for not including this important information.
5,Great Album,"I knew I loved Tone when I first heard Solidarity. Though this album isn't quite as interesting, it is still excellent and has a couple killer tracks."
3,Things don't always go the way you expect,"I was having trouble with the message in this book. Little Critter invited a friend over to play because he didn't want to play alone. Everything he and his friend (who is nameless) do results in competition and disappointment. The book ends with Little Critter saying that while he and his friend have fun (something not well documented here), sometimes it's nice to be alone."
1,Not worth the money,"I generally like Grizzly stuff but these chisels are not worth the money. As another user noted, after only a few strikes with the mallet cleaning dovetails the chisels chiped and broke off in large chunks. The fit and balance are great, but unless durability in actul work is fixed, you'd be wasting your money."
2,Dissatisfied... not a time saver.,"I purchased this additional cover AND pusher in order to reduce the amount of prep time to cut down bigger vegetables and fruits. With the design, as it is, the pusher has to be at least 4 inches into the tube before it will activate the machine. I'm sure this was done to justify the price and inconvenience of having to purchase BOTH the lid and the pusher (as well as to keep stupid people from putting their arms down the tube) However, with the activation button being so deep in the tube, you have to cut everything as small as you would have had to cut it originally to get it into the regular tube. A complete engineering failure and expensive, unhelpful accessory."
1,Disabled without the pusher,"The pusher activates the food processor (in the handle portion of the wide mouth feed lid shown on this page), but it not included. I received the lid only to find that I have to order another part. I agree with the other reviewer, but am giving this product one star instead of four stars since it is useless without ordering the pusher (the processor will not work) What were they thinking when this was packaged? It's not like someone is likely to already have the overly expensive wide mouth pusher (see price first) before ordering this product."
2,Weak design but whatta ya gunna do?,"I give this a one or a two. Why are we having to replace them in the first place. Let me tell ya why. It is a weak design. I can't believe KitchenAid, a company that builds appliances like tanks, would put so many, easily breakable, moving plastic parts into a handle just to prevent an accident. Sometimes the problem with engineers is they over think things. This is a classic example of complex solution to a simple problem. Simple problems usually have simple solutions, this plastic heap is it. But hey, you got the appliance, whatta ya gunna do, use it as a paper weight or buy another one. KitchenAid needs to decide whether they are in the parts business or the appliance business otherwise they start to look like Pontiac or other American car makers a decade or two ago. We know where that quality standard got them. Kitchenaid, make appliances that don't require replacement parts or I will start purchasing another brand. I am not so loyal as to be a fool."
4,One of the Best Books I've Ever Read,"I am a high school math teacher and picked this book out of one of my cupboards for some lame ""read during school"" promotion (It's not like they ever have ""do math during school"" promotions...). I found the book difficult to put down. The book is filled with intriguing information at several levels; the math, the biographies, the drama, etc. Terrific book."
4,Good Historical Reference,"This happened to be just what I was looking for: info on some of the more prominent mathematicians in history, in a short readable format. Not written as a necessarily easy, novel-like read, but definitely worth adding to my library."
1,Consumer Alert,"Just to let everyone know, I added 3 of these brackets and an 8' brass 2""OD rail, end caps to Amazon cart. B4 committing to purchase I went to the Kegworks website and the total was $30 less ! They rip you off by buying thru Amazon instead of discounting. These items were not on sale on their website. I decided to do more google fishing and found the same items and better selection including 6' length instead of 8' rails on a Vermont competitor website that also uses Paypal for payment. I saved over $50 over Amazon prices for higher end brackets and engraved end caps for 5 minutes of research. You buy Kegworks footrails and accessories via Amazon, you'll pay way too much. Shipping cost is per item, no bundled prices!"
4,tooooo cute!,This YODA is tooooo cute! My 7 year old loved it! It's the perfect size for traveling and for curling up with at night. We think it's awesome!
4,Yoda Super Deformed Plush is Super!,Yoda Super Deformed Plush is a great little gift for the young Star Wars fans.
2,Disappointment,"I was extremely surprised that, after a glowing review, this DVR is very short, has only fair video quality, very poor audio quality and a terrible selection of Bob & Ray skits. The publicity suggests that it's typical of their work. I listened to them dsily for many years on a local AM station. (WTIC: The Bob Steele Show)I feel that this disc is extremely overpriced since there are only two short segments (done on The Johnny Carson Show) that actually represent their humor; the others do not."
2,Banner Growth Chart,This is not holding up as well as I liked. Area's where is was folded to ship are now tearing. It was taped but I feel it could have held up better. But the Grandchildren love coming over and getting measured.
1,One use and it was DONE!,"I went to use this product for the first time shortly after it was delivered. My food was only cooking for an hour or so when it actually began to flame up and catch fire! The entire crock pot got burned all over and is now ruined! Thank goodness I was home to unplug it and put the flames out. If I had left my home while it was cooking it could have been a disaster! I got in contact with rival about the product but they took no responsibility. They told me to take some cooking lessons instead of blaming their product! How insulting...If you value your dollars and your safety, stay away from this dangerous product!"
2,Hotter than a pistol,"Good news: you don't need to completely disassemble the laptop to get at the hard-drive or optical-drive.Annoying news: the ram is located under the keyboard, the removal of which is tricky.Bad news: complete disassembly is required to replace an ailing cooling fan, the machine has lots of hidden plastic tabs holding it together, and take-apart guides are very hard to find."
4,Review on Toshiba Satellite tablet laptop,"excellent machine.. upgraded ram + os, replaced hdd. some keys have failed and the battery is DEAD.. still worth having though."
1,Do not buy from this company,"Our tablet pc arrived in a timely manner but shortly there after the hard drive locked up. Returned pc as instructed and haven't heard from them, except poorly worded emails. no answer on supplied telephone no. Completely dissatisfied"
5,Excellent step by step book,"Some items in the book may seem very basic but necessary if you want to learn GoLive the right way. For instance when linking - it really is a point and shoot system. I guess once you get the hang of it as the way the book describes the step by step procedure - you'll find similar attributes in MSVisio. This book may seem simple but necessary in its step by step procedure. Each chapter enumerates on each part of the creation of a professional html web page. I recommend this book if you want to learn how to use GoLive the right way, which will in-turn advance you to be more creative with your ideas."
4,GoLive 6.0 Classroom in a Book is Awesome!!!,"I just finished reading Adobe GoLive 6.0 and found the book very informative, easy to understand, and the lesson's on the CD were of course simple, but fun to work with. Although for windows users there is a .bat file that you must use to unlock the lessons. Some CD's were shipped without this program and the CD is useless without it! But, there's good news, if you call Peachpit Press, Berkeley, CA they will ship you a CD in just a few days.I did however find a few mistakes, but I've designed, and published my web site as I've read through and completed the lesson assignments. Your welcome to check out my web site, and there's an e-mail link on my home page so you could contact me if you like. Thank's to Adobe for setting the standard for web authoring software.David L.

5,Already arrived! Ready to go dancing!,"These shoes are awesome! And the reasonable price makes them a gift! I never order red or high heels, but I thought I could try them at this price! Well, I'm ready to go dancing! Very sexy (love the red) and I can actually walk in the heels (love it). They do run a little big- maybe a size 8 foot could wear them. I hope so. More women should be wearing these shoes. Just goes to show that quality and originality can be possible at a reasonable price. Thank you! I will be buying more- but first- I'm going dancing! bj"
3,Not what I expected,"Great shoe with design and all. Just not what I expected. I thought they would be a lot more sturdier as I am a more hefty fellow myself. However they are very cool shoes for poolside, shower, or on the beach."
4,Not bad,"I liked the plot description, and I like time travel, people-out-of-place stories, so I thought I would try this. It was kind of a cross between ""The Lake House"" and ""Premonition."" It even had Julian McMahon in it - for that alone I would watch it. It's an enjoyable story - a little slow-paced at times, with shots of the countryside and sunshine on the river, but worth watching."
