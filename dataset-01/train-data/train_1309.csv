1,Don't even bother,"I am over this series. Really, enough already. Based on the very strong plots of the first 6 books in the Anita Blake series, I have kept reading each new book hoping for more of the same. Instead we, the loyal readers, are treated to ridiculous amounts of sex with thinner and thinner plots holding it together. Truly, if you took the sex out of this last installment, there might be a good 50 pages of plot going on here.I'm no prude, sex can add a lot to developing characters and relationships in a series. But if Laurell K. Hamilton wanted to write a soft-porn series, why did she get us hooked on a good story line of regular fiction first? Seriously, she should just start writing another line under a pen name (a la Anne Rice) to indulge her fantasies. This would leave her free to reinstate the strong story lines that were a hallmark of the original Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series....a hallmark which is sadly lacking from Danse Macabre."
5,Anita.. Anita,"I've read a lot of vampire novels, romance, suspense and horror. Anita still surpasses them as the Deva.Laurell K. Hamilton makes the character engaging. I happen to enjoy her books, sex scene's and all.People flock to the gory descriptions of blood loss and murder as a way of feeding some vampires, if you put sex in place of blood, what is the difference? It's still a compulsion the characters are bound to fulfill which fuels a story.Hearing about innards and organs is better than graphic sex?Thank you Laurell."
2,I give up!,"I keep reading . . . and reading . . . but I now officially give up. The past, what, 5-6 books have been almost indistuishable. It's like a three-page story filled with hundreds of pages of the exact same sex-internal magical crisis-sex-internal magical crises related to sex - on and on and on and on. I like the first three, especially, because they were interesting stories. I just can no longer read another page of what is essentially the same plot repeated over and over with so little variation. It's sad when even the hot sex scenes do little because we have read it all before."
1,"All Sex, No Plot","I'm glad I didnt buy it, I only borrowed it from a friend. There used to be more to Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter than sex. There isnt any more. Dont bother to buy it unless you want plotless sex scenes."
1,She's breaking my heart,"After reading the first couple of chapters online, I had hope for this book. I knew there would be lots of soap opera drama but the begining was something that I had hoped meant Anita was going to get dog smacked into her previous reality.The plot had awesome potential! Anita possibly preggers, a converging of several Masters of the City upon St. Louis, the awakening of new powers and the restless dreaming of the Mother of Darkness were all plots that could have made this book into something worth reading. But all these things were like background candy instead of the true plot. If we could get Anita less focused on the male buffet that she seems to have to gorge on every twenty seconds then there would be hope for the series.This book was another disappointment. I can't quit reading them simply because I will see it to the finish but I have definitely quit running to the bookstore the day they come out."
2,Guilty Pleasures indeed!,"I have to accept the truth. I am a vampire. Not the kind who drinks blood, but the kind who sucks down truly bad novels. I take them to bed with me, sometimes 2 or more at a time. I'm completely ok with a book that introduces a vampire Chicago mob boss, and then does nothing with the character except put him in sex scenes. Sometimes I love a book, sometimes I like it, sometimes it's just because I need to read, sometimes as often as every two hours. I've tried reading in almost every position, standing, sitting, on my side. Lately I feel that certain books and I are drawn to each other, but I'm not sure our relationship is good for either one of us. I feel that I should send Danse Macabre far away from me, but I don't want to. I'm going to read it again."
1,Disappointed,Very disappointed in this one. Weak story line outside of her relationship issues. Graphic sex and relationship issues seemed to account for about 80% of the book - not the reasons I read the other 13 books.
3,Nothing riveting about #14 in the Anita Blake Series,"More and more, the Anita Blake series is focusing on the preternatural sex and less and less on the vampire hunting and necromancy that were the main themes of the earlier books. I have to admit that the last Anita Blake novel in the series I really enjoyed was Obdsidian Butterfly. After that they're turning into a kind of Meredith Gentry variation (a series which I do in fact enjoy). Not bad but as others have noted, but the ending was a sad anti-climax and the spell of Anita Blake has been lost with Micah and with this novel as far as I personnally am concerned."
3,Average at best,"At the time of this review, the average Amazon rating on the book is 2.5 stars, and i agree with that assessment. While the books have definitely produced more sex scenes with each installment, they don't captivate me the way they had earlier in the series. I really miss the old vampire killing Anita, but I also understand you can only carry the storyline so far without it becoming repetitive.To me, it was similar to what Anne Rice faced with Lestat. Once he did the whole devil/savior meetings, what is left? You can climb the mountain once, but any more than that, and it isn't worth the read. I see she has another book slated for a December release. I will give it a read, but my expectations won't be as high. I hope LKH finds her footing and produces another fine novel without the 90% sex from DM."
2,no new ideas,i started reading this series and it was ok as the number of books increased so the number of new ideas decreased untill it was books pretending to be a new story where as it was thinly vieled effort at writing porn and repetitive porn at that rehashed sex scenes over and over again it seems noyhing happens in this world when your undead except sex cravings give it a miss buy a real porn story and cut out the middle man
1,I am done.,"I was a huge fan of this series, but I just can't take it anymore. . I feel like Laurell K Hamilton has lost the voice of Anita Blake entirely. I don't even think she's writing this series to continue the story anymore; I feel that she is sacrificing this series for some sort of personal agenda or something. It is silly to force yourself to read something because you are a fan of the author's earlier works, so this is my last attempt to read Anita Blake. I couldn't even get interested enough to finish the book."
3,blah blah blah...,"Hmmm normally I wont put her books down but I found it hard to keep picking this one back up...the sex is so unreal anymore, I literally skimmed through most sex scenes...hense the ""blah blah blah"" I'm not a prude, and like most everyone else I love sex, but come on...and where was the story line? I thought we were going somewhere with the ballet and other Masters in town...Oh man, I miss the old Anita, this book was 483 pages of ISSUES, so many personal issues...I'm not going to give up, if this is all we get, I'll keep reading but I'll also keep bitching about it too until the REAL Anita shows up...BTW, I still LOVE LOVE LOVE Nathaniel, I can't wait to see him again..."
1,A Total Waste of Time,"I can't believe I actually took the time to read this book. Of course, I've read them all up until now and apparently I don't know when to quit. This book had no plot, other than Anita sleeping with or talking about sleeping with anyone that she came in contact with. Bad porn doesn't even begin to describe the sex scenes. What happened to the adventure and the mystery of this series? If something doesn't improve soon, I'm going to start cheering for the enemies."
1,"please, can you refund my life?","After the start of a mad love affair, I have now come to the sad and heart breaking conclusion that this goose is well and truly cooked. No longer can I put up with badly written so called 'love' scenes, that I am contemplating having a backyard bon fire with my collection of LKH's work, but knowing my luck and with all that ardeur written about, it would turn into a bush fire and burn down my whole neighbourhood! What started out as a great and exciting series with interesting story lines, lots of gore and good characters, has now turned into something better suited to a 10 Easy Steps to Fall Asleep Guild. I feel ripped off, hoping that with each book I buy, the characters and plot would be better, (and maybe Richard might eat a bullet...a girl could hope) I'm sorry Anita, I thought we could have been great together, but I want a refund of the last four months of my life!"
1,Missing a Plot.....,I reread the books Guilty Pleasures through Obsidian Butterfly. But this book as with the last I doubt I will reread. This one didn't even have a plot and the plot in the last was thin. Each time I hang on to see if the wonderful rich characters of the beginning books in the series show back up. If the tough compassionate Anita will be present. But it isn't there. I used to read her books in one evening...not able to put them down. And now this book took me 3 months to get through as it just didn't grab me because I couldn't figure out when the plot would kick in. Even the last chapter I kept hoping that something would come tying it all together to make sense but it didn't happen.If you enjoy stories about Vampires and werewolves please pick up the the early books and you enjoy the stories.
4,What? I liked it.,"I'm a ""new"" fan to the series. I read the very first book and most of the latest ones. I like it. Yes, it's all sex, but still fun! We are still learning more about Anita's powers, about other vampires, and the Anitaverse. I'd gladly read 4-5 more books like this. Entertaining, keeps me reading. Hey, bring it on."
1,I liked the old Anita better,"I bought this book hoping that Ms Hamilton would go back to writing actual plots and interesting cases for Anita, but alas I was sadly disappointed. All we get to hear about are Anita's romps in bed, and that she gets more power and has to have everyone possible explain it to her, over and over. Is there a plot to this? I am not sure. Not much happens until the very end of the book. I have been a fan of Ms Hamilton for many years, but her writing over the past few years has too much sex and not enough plot. I am sorry to say I have finally given up on a good book from her and won't be reading any more."
1,"Jerry Springer, with Vampires","We can't expect an author to write the same book over and over; but to take a character 180 degrees the way LKH has with Anita Blake is a bit much. There wasn't sex in the first four books and now that seems to be all there is. There is no plot, no storyline and you can't keep track of the sex partners without a spreadsheet.Danse Macabre is boring and repetitious. How many different ways can her characters do it? In the later books sex powers the magic; lots of cults propound that theory in real life but its an invalid theory. If there is only gray, instead of black and white (good vs. evil) where is the conflict? Anita has become what she used to call ""coffin bait."" Is this character development or merely a history of the corruption of Anita Blake? Someone has to be the bad guy. Is it going to be Anita?This book was unpleasant, juvenile and endless, I thought it would never end."
1,"very,very sad","I tried.I really tried to give this author another chance.I loved Anita Blake.I could not wait for a new story but, I can not handle soft porn being the substitute for her great adventures.I could not finish this book.It was boring and I do not recommend this or the series until there is actually a story to be read."
1,Severely Disappointed,"I used to be a huge Anita Blake fan...then her character just seemed to disappear. I agree with most of the other posters here, she started out as a strong woman who knew who she was and what she wanted in life, and now she is drowned in a pool of men none of who she seems to have real affection for. All sex all the time...does anyone remember the sweet anticipation of that first kiss with Jean Claude in the hotel room? Now you just have to wait for page 3, and 10, and 25...etc...to get meaningless contact between 2 or 3 or 4 bodies. And poor Edward...turned from a magnificent killing machine, to a family guy. I'm afraid I'm done with the Anita Blake series.I do enjoy the Meredith Gentry series, where the sex at least has a purpose. For those of you missing vampires and werewolves, may I suggest the author Kim Harrison and her Rachel Morgan series...absolutely fabulous writing, and she has stayed true to her main character."
1,Poorly written porn,"Ok, I admit it. I read the first few books and was in love. I could not wait to go through the rest before catching up with my beloved Anita and checked this one out of the library. I am terribly disappointed. It's Bodily Fluid Central, yo. I'm outta here."
1,I returned it...,"I miss the old Anita Days that are just never to return. Honestly, I'm Not squeamish about the sex, just longing for the charachter, personalities and yes, a cohearant plot. I was hoping that Anita was pregnant in this book--- just to reduce the constant, no longer arousing simply because of the back-to-back redundancy- sex scenes.They don't add to the story or to the figures in the book.So I returned this copy and occasionally pick up some of the good ol' Anita of yore that seemingly ended with Obsidian Butterfly. Come back Ms. Hamilton! Come back!"
1,Disappointing,"I never thought I'd say this about an Anita Blake story, but this book is boring beyond belief. It's also pure porn, and porn of the worst kind -- it's not particularly erotic, just monotonous. It feels like Hamilton is kitchen sinking Anita, too, with the packing in one preternatural attribute on top of another. The series started off promising, but has gone steadily downhill as the pseudo-smut has pushed out the thriller and/or mystery aspects of the books. I gave up halfway through. It wasn't worth the effort involved in turning the pages."
1,Laurell is burned out,"Like many people who have posted their reviews here, I am a long time fan. I was very disappointed in the last Anita book and scanned this one to see if it was the same type of material (bad, angry soft-core porn) it was. I put it back on the shelf and my money went unspent. I have sympathy for Laurell. If she needs a break to find her enthusiasm for writing she should take it for as long as she wants. True fans will wait for her to rediscover her love for writing. Until then I will reread her older works."
2,The reviews for this book are correct!,"I have been a fan of the Anita Blake series for 4 - 5 years, and am eager to read each new book. But, I have to agree with most of the reviews written about Danse Macabre. Anita's job, personality, and interaction with her friends were the things that made these books so engaging. The passion and sex in the earlier books were part of the overall plot, and gave insights into Anita, her partner(s), and their relationship. Danse Macabre, however, is a number of sex scenes poorly held together with a very thin plot.If you are a big Anita Blade fan, you will still probably want to read Danse Macabre, but borrow it or wait for the paperback."
2,Where's the plot?,"I used to really look forward to the next installment.. at present, all I can say is that we're still dealing with angst from books ago.Oh, there are still threads of the old Laura K.. just enough to tantalize. Overall, though, the tale is simply an orgy without a storyline. And more than a couple of stars is a stretch."
1,Failure to do... Anything,"This book was a major disappointment. The book had no action what so ever and no plot. I don't mind the ""love"" scenes, but this series is just no what it used to be. I started reading the series with Narcissus in Chains, and the action and murder investigations are what caught my eye and made the book a worthwhile and interesting read. I have bought all of the books in the series, and I expected more from Ms. Hamilton. I can only hope that the next book has some action or I fear that this novel will be the mark of a failure in Laurell K Hamilton's career as a writer."
1,Cookie Monster???,"Just one of the new characters who we ""meet"" (Anita screws/enchants/becomes the circle of their universe) in this book. Once he was introduced, I pretty much stopped reading. There are too many other good books out there to waste any more time on this travesty.I am so done with Laurell. It's her perogative to write erotica, but please don't market it to fans of the Vampire Hunter series. It's has nothing to do with hunting anymore, and the sex is not sexy at all, IMO. I'd put my foolishly purchased copy on e-Bay, but I can't list it with a clear conscious.I can't explain how disappointed I am in this book and the turn that LKH's writing has clearly taken."
3,Might as well call it erotica,"Just read this over the long 4th holiday and while I did enjoy it and I did read it quickly, it was a disappointment over all. It seems Hamilton has given up any pretense of carrying on the vampire hunter storyline for now and is just focusing on the relationship of Anita and the main characters. Again, this book encompasses only a 24 hour time period and that is getting tiresome. The sex is steamy at times, but it is getting repetitive and disinteresting. I did skip over alot of it. There were also repeats of discussions between the characters which have been had before and need not be revisited yet again. Hamilton needs to move this story along. I can only presume she is trying to capitalize on the burgeoning erotica for women market because that's pretty much all this is. Definitely not her best effort, but it is a guilty pleasure."
1,PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"I wasn't going to waste my time leaving a review but I figured anyone bored enough to pick up this book should be warned. It was the biggest waste of my time this entire summer, which is an accomplishment, let me assure you. I won't rant and rave, others have pointed out everything I hated plus more and have done so more eloquently than I could hope of doing myself. Just avoid it."
1,Thumbs down. WAY DOWN.,"This book was what made me stop reading Hamilton's work. It features horribly written sex scenes, characters with stupid names, and a plot so devoid of intellect I can't even remember what the book was supposed to be about.Anita has decided to let her freak flag fly, and while this could have led to some interesting character development, Hamilton lets it slide in favor of tacky clothing descriptions.What was once a witty series featuring a character who knew her flaws has de-evolved into another masturbatory ego-stroke for Hamilton."
3,Always an Anita fan!,"I love the Anita Blake series. Now saying that, I have to say that the newer books are a bit different from the older ones. Not as much gets done because of all the talking, fighting, and drama. I miss the crimes and the survival aspect, and that has been pushed aside for the emotional aspect of Anita's relationships. I will continue to buy these books because I love Laurell and her characters, but I miss the old style."
3,Where's the plot?,"The book was ok. It's just a different formula from what i've come to expect in this series. I guess Anita's just evolving with all her powers and all the men in her life. Changes were bound to happen. I'll still read any book Laurell writes that has Anita in it. She's just a good character. Not many liked this book but if you're a true fan of the series, you take the good with the not so good."
3,"Danse Macabre not her best, but still sexy.....","Enjoyed this part of the series, but feel that Hamilton has resorted to writing too much about sex and not enough about vampire hunting.....even tho the sex is HOT, the plotting has become thin, and the suspense is missing. For Anita fans, it's a must read....but the first 5 or 6 in the series are better."
5,danse macabre,"it was everything i had hoped for in the series of Laurell K. Hamilton Anita Blake Vampire Hunter . I have bought the whole series and I'm enjoying myself. Each character brings their own flavor to the plot but Jean-Claude ,Richard , Micah and Nathaniel are to die for."
1,awful!,"This is no longer a vampire hunter series. Anita is whiny and self-indulgent. The only character that is even worse is Richard. LKH's writing seems repetitive, not ""pushing the envelope."" This book seems to be more about Anita's hang-ups and circles 'round and 'round and 'round until you just want to skip to the last chapter, just to find out who lives and who dies. No mystery to solve. Just sex (metaphysical and otherwises) and Anita's endless (read: repetitive and boring) struggle with herself. This is probably going to be the last book in this series that I read. It's such a tragedy, because the first few books of the series were really good."
2,*sigh*,"i was sorely dissapponted with this book. luckily i got it from the library and didnt' waste 20.00 on it.i think maybe her publishers are rushing her into the next book, the next book. i think i liked it better when they were coming out one a year. one anita one merry.this barely plot crud is getting tiresome. i'll read the next ones, but i'm not gonna buy them, i tell you that much"
1,Just wrong!!,"Where's the plot at? Like the old Wendy's commercial looking for the beef, I'm looking for the plot. I've been an avid reader of LKH's Anita Blake series since the very beginning and I have to say that I am so disappointed. Anita Blake was once a character with substance, now she is only one dimensional. Anita would fly off the page at you now she is just as flat as the paper she is written on. In this book you don't see any of the old Anita Blake, after I read about 300 pages I was at a loss for what the story was about. I hope that LKH can find that old spark she had in the beginning or she is looking at losing a lot of her most loyal readers. Sex is the spice of life not the whole meal."
1,The Horse is Dead Stop the Beatings!,"I had hopes that this book would be the savings of the Anita Blake series. God, was I wrong. SAVE YOUR MONEY! I'm only 100 pages into the book and it feels like a sentence in Hell. There is NO PLOT and the sex has not only ceased to have a point it just plain old boring. There's no chemistry between the characters. Reading this book I couldn't help feeling that the writer has come to hate what she does and it shows. There are so many other great alpha female supernatural books out there now that are far better written and much cheaper. Save yourself the agony and the money and give up on L.K.H., she's wrung herself dry."
1,disapointed fan,"After a long wait betwen books, I'm afraid I have to agree with most of my fellow reviewers.... Wow. What a letdown. Sorry, Laurel, it's not about the sex scenes, I'm also a big fan of Angela Knight, and her sex scenes are blowtorch hot! I used to love Anita and her magick, where the hell is it? No more kicking butt with newly discovered powers, no new anything, although I love that Asher now has an animal to call. I never thought I'd be disapointed in an Anita book, but, I'm still hoping the next one with Edward will be back to the real Laurel Hamilton standard for Anita. Not giving up yet. Every one gets tired. Come on, Laurel, you still have some amazing books in you."
3,Story?,"I have read everything Hamilton has written with the Anita Bryant character. This book had an excess of sex and a deficit of story line.Her earlier novels had interesting plots to accompany the sex. Now the plots are very incidental and the characters spend entirely too much time in the bedroom, etc. Disappointing."
3,Did this book hit a train?,Okay I liked the whole possibly pregnant thing that was great for supense...but she made poor Ronnie into such a B*tch...yeah she was kinda one before but after this book she might as well kill her...why was their no police case this book?... its one of my favorite parts!...the sex could be a whole lot better I could write better myself...well thats basically all I have hopefully the merry gentry novel will be better...lets all go read something else for a while
2,Plot? What plot?,"As a long time fan of LKH, I am severely disappointed in her works lately. Danse Macabre seems to be just a string of sex and ""feeding"" with no real point. Whatever happened to the mystery, the whodunit? There used to be a climax that had nothing to do with sex, and a resolution. Now, though I still enjoy her writing style, I find myself at the end of the book wondering why I just spent so much time reading it."
2,Disappointed...Utterly Disappointed,"My opinion, and my opinion only. As an avid fan of LKH, I can truly say, this was the last straw. What happened to Anita?? Yeah Yeah, characters develop..but I don't see that happening much here. The book spans approx. 2 days, during which not much happens but sex, more sex, sex again, talking about sex..blah blah blah. And no..I'm not a prude, on the contrary. But when page after page is about Anita and someone getting it on...I mean c'mon! Let get Anita doing SOMETHING besides taking off her clothes already..What happened to the Plot?? You start feeling like there will be a plot, when new characters are introduced, new powers are alluded to, etc...but while you get a few tastes here and there...NADA.And when things start to pick up again...and get exiciting..BAM..book over..wth? I was actually so frustrated with reading this book, I started expressing my frustrations to anybody who would listen at home...Now only if LKH would listen..."
2,Where Has the Slayer of Bad Guys/Gals Gone?,"I have been reading the Anita Blake series, starting with Guilty Pleasures years ago. The last time she battled evil was Obidian Butterfly. Since then she has been bed hopping. She threatens, but doesn't follow through.One other thing people, if you read her interview, she doesn't give a damn what her readers think. You don't like lots, and lots of sex. Too bad. Anita doen't fight the bad guys. Too bad.My advise for whatever it is worth. Go to the libraries, or buy her books used.Karen"
2,Engrossing...yet ultimately unfulfilling,"I read this book quickly, as I usually do with the Anita Blake series - it drew me in, and I finished it in two days. Once I was done, I found myself thinking about the plot, and realized that there isn't one. Anita does not raise any zombies, execute any vampires, solve any mysteries for the police. The entire book is Anita having sex in different ways, with different men, and either gaining new powers or a deeper understanding of the ones she already has. While the ""is she or isn't she pregnant?"" drama was an excellent way to further the relationships she's already in, watching the various men in Anita's life react to her possible pregnancy and her sexcapades does not equal a storyline.The earliest Anita Blake novels had plenty of plot but no emotional depth or interaction; the most recent ones are nothing but finding new men for Anita to sleep with and new ways for her to do it. Did this series peak somewhere around ""Obsidian Butterfly""??"
2,Sex and Violence,"While I still enjoy the Anita Blake series, Hamiltons sellout to the ""paranormal romance"" market has only accelreated; as the timelines in her books have become compressed.The total story arc of this novel covers I believe three days, and doesnt do very much to advance the general storyline, or Anitas life. The sex scenes are both excessive and repetitive. Lets face it, theres only so many words to come up with for the same act, adn when you write a new three page sex scene every thid page (seriously, I dont think the book goes for more than about three pages without a sex scene)...I don't mind sex, I rather enjoy it in fact; even in fiction if well done and appropriate to the story; but when the sex becomes the entire book, that's no longer any kind of story it's jsut porn for people who are too repressed to buy it at an adult shop.The characters are still great, but when will she DO SOMETHING with them again, other than kinky sex."
1,Bleeech!,"I don't know what this thing was but it wasn't a book! No plot! No story! No action! Or well...Hrm...Let's see...Anita has sex....and more sex....and well..more sex. I'm not sure what the point of the book was. Nothing happens but some sex. Anita gains more powers....and she can't control them....hrm...yeah.....maybe that was the plot.I'm ok with sex in a book....but usually there's a point to it. Some reason or something that gives a basis for the sex. not to be found here.I'm giving it 1 star because I can't seem to give it less. What was a good series, and had immense potential, has become some cheap harlequin novel...and a bad one at that."
1,"Bye, Anita","I miss the Anita of old. I thought I'd give this one more try. The porn got the best of me. I could deal with it in other books, where there was at least a murder to solve. These books have gotten too preachy and whiny, and way too explicit fo my tastes."
1,Sadly not really surprising,"As much as I hate to say it - I really had a hard time with this book. I really miss Ms. Hamilton's charm and wit when there is an active interesting plot - with less group sex. This book was simply over the top with bad group sex scenes. Each chapter segues into more group sex and more sex some with a little violence or confusion. Don't look for sharp banter or deep meaning subplots between Jean Claude, Anita or Richard ( or any other character for that matter). This book is trite and played out in the sex department -no two ways about it.I'm just going to have to go back and read the beginning of the series again in order to enjoy an Anita Blake book with a plot.Don't waste your money on this one!! I'm not holding out hope for the next one. It seems as though Ms. Hamilton has had her way with Anita and it sure wasn't pretty!"
1,Done with this series and sad for it,"I didn't immediately get upset with the turn this series had taken in NIC. I actually liked NIC and CS and I even tolerated ID and Micah. But this? Reading this book makes it hard to remember why I even liked this series in the first place. It doesn't even pretend to have a plot it's just sex, rinse, repeat. I can't read this drivel anymore, it's an insult to my intelligence and to who these characters once were. I'm done."
1,Wow - last LKH book I waste my money on,"I really haven't enjoyed a LKH book since Obsidian Butterfly and all the books before that title.If I wanted to read porn, I'd just buy Penthouse. About 3 pages worth of plot and the rest I skipped. Too bad LKH, your vanity has really messed up a great series that was full of fun, good plots and interesting char. and it looks like lots of people agree with me, so I'm guessing that your sales are going to begin going down as people realize that like a tiger, you are not going to change your stripes. When you tell your readers to like it or don't buy it - well with an attitude like that I wouldn't."
2,Average at best,Don't waste your money. This book is too hard to follow. It is really not very well written.
4,Get Good Information With this Book,This is another great resource that helped me deal with a very bad SEO outsourcing project with new inexperienced webmasters. The Pay Per Click Search Engine Marketing Handbook is an absolutely amazing book and it truly deserves a read. Even if you outsource the duties read this book.John Halloran
4,"Not a ""How To"" book but great for beginners","There is such a small amount of information available to those that set up a Pay Per Click (PPC) campaign that any book on the subject is helpful.This book gives a great overview of what PPC is all about and is probably the most current source on the subject available today.It is a great reference guide for beginners, and interesting for the advanced marketer in that it lists some tools that might otherwise be overlooked.This is not however a ""How To"" manual and will not tell you how to optimize your campaign with the PPC search engines. There are many strategies employed by professional Search Engine Marketing professionals that are too extensive to cover in one short book, but if you want to educate yourself on the PPC marketplace in general then this is a great place to start."
4,Religious Studies Review,This masterful study challenges the traditional view of Judas as a traitor who betrayed Jesus...Klassen relies upon impressive linguistic evidence...he also provides a strong exegesis of NT texts...Highly recommended for a wide range of readership from specialists to serious laypersons.
1,OLD FANS REJOICE,No doubt old fans will cherish every note!While I could appreciate that this once celebrated artist has a unique voice and singing style her performance could not win me over !
4,Well worth the price.,"This DVD offers a treasure trove of Christmas themed eppisodes of classic and not-so-classic TV shows from the 50's and 60's. Where else would a person find a Christmas eppisode of ""Robin Hood"" with Richard Greene?"
2,Poor Image Quality,"While the cover here clearly shows 51 episodes, the disc I received only had 48 episodes. The image quality is HORRIBLE. There was absolutley no attempt to clean up the film, which is a real shame. At one point, my Robin Hood Christmas Goose episode showed words across the screen that said something to the effect of adjusting calibration. (Uh, this is a dvd, no adjusting of VHS on my end!) As for the sound, the voice track was good."
1,Not worth the time to watch!,I have only watched the first DVD and may not even watch the others. The Dragnet shows are depressing and several of these shows are not appropriate for Christmas shows.This was definitely a waste of money even though it was inexpensive!
2,Poor Picture Quality,"I was not too happy with these DVD's cause the quality of the picture is very poor. The 1st episode Robin Hood is blurred looking. Also, It is packaged very cheap with just disks in paper covers stacked together...It is vintage series,but the quality could be better."
1,i didn't really like,i didn't really like because it was to old for me so i gave it to some that wouldenjoy it more
2,to many really old shows,I thought it would be shows from the 60's and 70's but a lot of them were way before my time and the quality was horrible
4,Holiday TV Classics,Got these to watch at Christmas while walking on my treadmill. Some of them I've seen in my childhood days and some are before my time. Some are in black and white and some have color. But I really enjoy all these and they bring back so many memories.
3,Got It,I ordered this set as a surprise for my wife and was surprised myself when I found out it was the same set I had ordered last year but with a new cover and description. Oh Well!
1,Holiday tv Classics,This dvd set did not play at all. I was very disappointed. We tried the dvds in several players and it just would not show a picture.
2,didnt work on computer,"I was not impressed with the product, it was too old to play on the new computers."
5,*insert star wars quote*,"excellent. thats about the only thing to be said about Tie Fighter. Its a true simulation (not a arcade like game like Rogue Leader. which still rocks). the graphics, though dated, easily get the message through. the music is mindblowing (John Williams after all). and theres nothin gquite like watching a X-Wing shatter into a thousand tiny pieces. then the bitternes of having your own 'fighter being sheared in half because of the resulting debris. ahh, memorys, memorys..."
5,"""On Her Own Ground"" is an excellent book.","""On Her Own Ground:""""The Life and Times of Madam C.J. Walker"" (Lisa Drew Books) is an excellent history book about the mid 1800's to early 1900's and it is regarding Ms. Walker's beginning business of creating and concocting new hair remedies for hair shampooing, hair conditioning, and hair growth which were necessary ingredients for black people's hair in the early days as well as it is necessary for black people's hair today. It is interesting to read about how black hair care got started historically.I was able to write a college paper project using this book and other books and I received an 'A' for the grade on my assignment."
5,great game,"This is a great game. One thing many of the reviewers fail to note is the skill that a true comefrom behind victory requires. This is brought on by the bleeding death feature. If your severly down, chances are your not going to dart in and cut them to pieces before you drop from blood loss. It really adds a sense of urgency to your fights and requires you to think faster. No more hanging back and waiting for them."
2,(looks like it cool),"kengo looks like it cool.i played the game and the graphics look like p.s.1.when you fight,your arms are up in the air.if you like games like samurai type games,get onimusha:warlords or tenchu 2 there good games."
5,The Samurai of film in game format,"KENGO, Master of Bushido will remind you of all the very great Japanese films of the Samurai. Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, the Zatoichi series, Lone Wolf and Cub, Raizo Ichikawa's ""Nemuri"" series from the 1960's are here. You expect Toshiro Mifune or Shintaro Katsu to round a village corner at any moment. This game has captured their spirit, and then some. Listen to the sounds, distant chirping birds, water falling, a baby crying, it is wonderful. With Kengo the hours will fly by, you will still be studying at your dojo or trying to best yourself in acquiring some ancient sword skill. It is that good, the best game I have ever played, and the best on Playstation 2. As Tsukahara Bokuden wrote ""For the samurai to learn there is only one thing, One last thing - To face death unflinchingly."" In KENGO you will really learn, you may die, but through that process you will be reborn to learn again, and remember... it's only a game, or is it? Enjoy!"
5,31 year old gamer,"I love this game! I'm getting so bored of the same old fight games. That are button smashers and have no strategy during the fight. This game is a breath of fresh air. I love the part where you build your character up through training. Like in a roll playing game. The fighting gameplay is great. I love the way your chartacters start out as students and if your good enough, become masters. But the end is far from near. Now that you have become a master and have your own dojo, you must defend your mastership, honor and all your skills you have earned. For they can be taken away just as easily as you received them."
4,Kengo,This game is ok. Its not as good as Bushido Blade (so I've heard). Now there are life meters again. I really havent played it much (I just rented it and ZOE and I spent most my time with ZOE). I think its a good game though. But when you play in the dojos most of the times you use Bokkens which are the wooden swords.
1,"Another ""The End Is Near"" Nut","Another endtime supposed expert on prophecy. In his earlier works Hal Lindsey was one that decided that when Israel became a nation in 1948, that that was a fulfillment of prophecy and since the Bible considers a generation to be approximately 40 years, if you added 40 plus 1948 then you could see that 1988 would either be the start of the endtimes or the second coming of Christ. Also he said that the alignment of planets back in 1982 would denote some endtime activity. Of course none of these things happened but there is still big money to be made writing of these types of things. Most of these type of authors just make excuses or change their explanations of prophecy but they never admit they were wrong or quit writing new money-making books."
5,A five star book!,"I am currently an MBA student at Arizona State University, West Campus. As part of my Consulting Management class, taught by Dr. Alan Goldman, I had to read ""High Impact Consulting"" by Robert Schaffer.Dr. Goldman insisted we read this book, and I am thankful that he introduced me to such a great work! Even if is not on our job description, we all act, in a higher or lower degree, as consultants in our firms. This book makes so much sense! A true consultant wants to really help his/her client and wants to see results and improvements. Mr. Schaffer offers practical ideas how to avoid failure and achieve success. Unlike the wildly spread ""Trojan horse"" approach adopted by a large number of consulting companies, this book is advocating ""rapid-cycle, results-oriented projects designed for client-learning as well as for achievement"".Every manager should read this book - the ones that do act as consultants should cherish it, the ones that hire consultants, should use it as a guideline."
4,Great book for consultants,"This book was required reading for one of my university courses. The book is chock full of useful information that will help you give your clients what they paid for - excellent results!If you are wondering what this book is really all about, another title the author could have used is Results Driven Consulting. The author doesnt advocate the typical consulting model, which consists of analyzing a situation and giving recommendations. Instead, it suggests that the consultant should stick around, and help implement those recommendations to make sure the client is fully satisfied (and will call you back for future engagements). Overall, an excellent and informative book. The writing is a little dry and time consuming, but well worth the effort!"
2,Lesser Profits?,"While John Turturro is famous for his roles in ""Barton Fink""&""O Brother,where art thou?"",he stars in this movie as a mentally handicapped man who falls in with bookies.There's the Mafia,racial politics,the Mob luckily fails in killing him and he lives to see a Strange Happy Ending.It's hardly ""Pulp Fiction"",so in the end you're left saying ""Huh?"""
3,Wayne Kramer - 'Citizen Wayne' (Epitaph),"Looks to be Kramer's 6th solo effort out of eight.Didn't even know the former MC5 guitarist had released that many.This CD didn't exactly blow my mind,but I thought it was 'okay'.More or less straight ahead rock.Tunes that I sort of dug were ""Stranger In The House"",""Shining Mr.Lincoln's Shoes"",""Count Time""(also liked the live version of this tune on his 'LLMF' disc-see my review)and ""Farewell To Whiskey"".Line-up:Wayne Kramer-guitar&vocals,Bob Mair-bass and Brock Avery-drums."
4,listen to when fighting with your wife/girlfriend,"This is power pop with every song written about the joys and heartaches of women.Mirsky is a gifted songwriter that instead of moping and using dark images takes a wry, witty ""Seinfeld"" approach to his observations.The songs are all good. ""When good girls go bad"", ""When your'e a human being"" and ""I just want to be your Steve McQueen"" are excellent songs that warrant a larger audience. This is very intelligently worded and properly played power pop with all the proper jangly guitars. If this would have come out in the late 70's, when rock ruled the airwaves, it would have received a much larger appreciation. My only criticism would be that because the instrumentation is all the same, the songs do start to sound a bit similar and repetative.Overall, this artist has strong songwriting skills and should have more fame."
1,Horrible Sound,"This will be a short review because there is not much to say about this CD except that its sound-quality is very, very bad. I might have liked the orchestra's performance of this beautiful music, if I could stand the unbearable sonics. Buy at your own risk."
2,Outdated information,"This book was probably good for the time it was written (1981, according to the copyright), but it is really substandard in light of nearly 2 decades of further research into bird behavior. The first half of the book is about choosing a bird, caging and nutritional requirements, and grooming (wing and nail clipping). The remainder of the book is a cursory look at basic taming (of wild-caught birds, which isn't really an issue since importing birds has been outlawed for several years), and a brief explanation of how to train. If you want a good resource for training, you'd be better off with a more current book on behavior modification (try Mattie Sue Athan's books, for example). This book is mis-titled, and should not pretend to be a real ""training"" book. On the bright side, it has quite a few wonderful pictures of conures."
4,The Basics,"This book was bought used and the information is not particularly dated. Teitler has included a lot of nice photos and some information about conures, but some is the boiler plate on birds in general. If you know about taming and training birds, then you may want one more specific to conures than this one. Overall a good book, nice color photos of many species, worth the few dollars as a used item. It's 30 years old, so don't expect any technology references."
3,Chilling but Predictable,"This was a nice easy read about, Mary a clairvoyant psychic, that has a troubled past and can ""see"" grisly murders while they happen. It is basically about her coming to grips with her past, while at the same time she is seeing a serial killer commit murders. I found it very predictable that you are intentionally mislead (knowing darn well the author was not going to give you that kind of info. on the killer) believe it was one character. I had no problem knowing who the killer would be after a character was abruptly removed from the story...only to be never heard from again???? yeah right. Well, all in all it was entertaining."
1,Review of The Vision,"The Vision by Dean Koontz is a suspense thriller. Those who like Dean Koontz will probably enjoy this book. Although if you haven't read any of Dean Koontz's, like I hadn't, don't make this your first. It's the story of a woman who can see visions of murders before they happen. After help solving a crime she sees, and feels another vision that she knows will change her life. Now it's up to herself and her husband to stop the killer before he finds her. There are rules most authors have to try and throw a reader off from knowing how th book ends. By following these rules Dean Koontz practically gives away the ending. To sum up this book it would be that it's too predictable."
4,"Great book, a must read!!",This book was a great thriller with a murder twist. I'm absolutley positive that any young adult would love this book. It has a great plot and the characters are described in fine detial. One thing I loved about this book was how Dean Koontz kept you hanging in the air at the end of each chapter. It kept me reading all night! If you are looking for a wonderful mystrey please pick up a copy of this book!
2,Not Koontz's best effort,"Although it has its good points, ""The Vision"" is not Dean Koontz's best effort. The plot is cliched, the characters are flat, and the book is filled with long passages of dialogue by itself, without descriptions of what the characters are doing as they speak. The scene where Alan is torturing Mary as a child is graphic and upsetting. The only good thing about the book are the passages offering psychological insight into Mary's mind. Overall, I can't recommend it."
3,"Decent, Simple Thriller","Mere days ago I slammed Mr. Koontz for his horrible novel Demon Seed. From it one would (and probably should) get the sense that I was unwilling to give Koontz another chance. But I'm forgiving and often a glutton for punishment so I picked up The Vision. And I was not, for once, overly disappointed by Koontz.The story itself is not unconventional or overly imaginative - a psychic who helps police capture serial killers gets caught up in a little danger and mystery of her own. It is, however, well written and the characters are well developed and likable. Despite the fact that Koontz tries to convince readers otherwise, it's pretty obvious who the ""bad guy"" is, the novel is no less thrilling.Its not excellent but its certainly better than some other novels by Koontz."
3,Not Koontz best work.,"I am a huge Dean Koontz reader and have enjoyed many of his works. Watchers was a great read from one of his earlier works.I also have read all of his recent works and eagerly await each new release. But I have to give this book a dissappointing review. The character development was weak and the story line was not very engaging. With so many great alternatives, I'd stay away from this one."
1,Shocking,"They say that honesty is the best policy, and going by that age old adage, this review has to be published. 'The Vision' put simply, is simply not good. Woman born, woman has accident, woman becomes clairvoyant, woman sees into mind of 'murderous feind'. Sound familiar? It should if you've read any of Dean Koontz other 'novels'. Koontz tries to cover his inhability to suspend the readers disbelief by bogging them down in gorey discriptions of death and depravity, completely forgetting to develop a plot along the way. Once again Koontz does what he does best - managing to produce yet another best selling novel with absolutely no story whatsoever, with the questions being - How and for how much longer?"
3,Not Koontz's Best,"It didn't take me very long to figure out that this was one of Koontz's earlier works - thank goodness he has only improved with time!Koontz is my favorite author - and I have yet to find a book of his that I didn't enjoy. However, I can confidently say this one is at the bottom of the list. Yes, there are a lot of graphic scenes, especially toward the end, but anyone who enjoys this genre should be used to that.A lot of people said it was predictable - but I didn't figure it out until the last few chapters. So it did keep me guessing the whole way through.Overall, the plot of the book was fine, but the writing is not his best."
3,Good but not great,"Koontz's earlier work doesn't measure up to some later stuff such as Dragon Tears. The Vision is one of the rare moments that I actually enjoyed most of it. I do think the characters are a bit stale and kind of lay there like a dead fish on a dock. The reader should care about the characters. In most of the work I've read of Koontz, he does a wonderful job of causing the reader to care for the characters. You react to them.In this story, no reaction. No life. Just a story that falls flat amid a cast of cardboard characters nobody gives a rip about. The story had huge potential. The idea is not necessarily original, but in the hands of KOONTZ it could have been outrageous! Lucky for me I've read a billion other things he's written so I have the advantage of realizing this does not reflect his best effort."
3,a worthwhile read but not Koontz's best,"I found this book to be fairly mediocure in the main, however, some parts (towards the end In particular) made it worthwhile reading. The story revolves around Mary Bergen, a clairvoyent who has a visions so terrifying she blocks them out before she can find out their true meaning. It is then assumed these visions could actually be of her own death. Throughout the book koontz leaves many clues to who this potential killer may be, many of them misleading. So basically It ends with you trying to figure out who the bad guy could possibly be. Although I was tricked into thinking it was the wrong guy the eventual conclusion is fairly obvious(that is unless you are stupid like me). I would certainly reccommend this book but it is one of Dean's earliest and personally I have enjoyed the books he has written over more recent years such as; Fear Nothing, Intensity and Strange Highways etc..."
1,Wish I could give it a Zero,"Spoiler alert at the end of reviewdon't waste your time. I can't believe I like Dean Koontz. If this was the first of his books I ever read I'd avoid him like the plague. Too graphic, too disgusting, and quite frankly I'm surprised he hasn't been torn apart by what he wrote here. We do not need such detailed scenes he has written. I enjoy good horror and suspense, but do NOT need to read such disturbing images, regardless if the author thinks it's necessary to paint the evil of this one character, it's absoutely unnecessary and disgusting.I'm reading along, la de da, and then wham! Rape by and with children, and with animals, and scenes involving drinking menstural blood.I wish I could take back the time I spent reading this book. These scenes, very graphic and detailed, come in the last 20 pages. Beware. They are not only disgusting, but very disturbing."
3,The Vision,I thought The Vision was one of Koontz better books. It was suspenseful and kept me reading until the very end. I do believe that Koontz needs to be more original in his stories. The seem to just about always be set it the same place. I didn't like the bat rape scene in this book. What kind of thing is that to write about anyway. I hope I didn't give to much about the book away.
2,this book was too predictable,I read 2 chapters of this book and knew who committed all the murders. I was so dissapointed that I put the book down and didn't finish it. I am a HUGE Dean Koontz fan and I own almost every one of his books(With the exception of some of the hard to find ones) This is one of only two books that I was dissapointed in by Mr. Koontz. I don't think there is a better author out there. than him.
5,Gunsmith Cats,wowthis book was really good its defintly one of my favs nowi dont know what volume this is but you catch on fastits just like the discription only betterand theres 3 stories (but ones really a short extra)if you know you like gunsmith cats cheek it out if you dont buy it anyway
5,Awesome,Great podcast and now an awesome TV show. I get this show through cable but purposely bought here just to support them.
5,Even better than the first episode.,"Wow I like this one better than the pilot. Awesome. Keep up the good work Chris, Matt, Jonay and Mike."
5,23 Minutes of Sheer Entertainment,"The show is vastly entertaining. I'd never heard of the Nerdist Podcast before watching this, and only tuned in because of Matt Smith, but the chemistry of Chris Hardwick, Matt Mira, and Jonah Ray is impossible to resist. I've since moved on to following their podcast and eagerly await further episodes of their TV show.The humor is a great blend of irreverent and immature, and if you had any sort of geek/dork/nerd background growing up you will connect on a deeply molecular level to the three hosts. Bonus points for the Anamanaguchi opening theme, which feels like a secret handshake that welcomes you into a club you never knew you wanted to belong to."
5,So Awesome,"Reviewing this in twenty words or more? As soon as Vajonah posted on twitter it was available on Amazon and iTunes, I rushed right over. Love the podcast. The TV show is also awesome sauce. I hope BBCA decides to keep it around for a while. I wanted to support it so much, I didn't even pirate it!"
5,Very informative,My son is applying to DO schools and I found this book extremely informative. It provided a great history of the D.O. practice along with current issues facing Osteopathic physicians.
5,AN,An in-depth and insightful look at the history of Osteopathic medicine in America and the challenges the profession faces now that it has attained legitimacy.
2,Jury is still out.,"I bought two. One was installed in my new kitchen and burned out (with a puff of smoke) in less than a year. It would always run hot, but it was installed in a plastic box, not metal. I am going to install the second one in the same location, but in a metal box to see if the metal box acts like a heat sink and keeps the switch from over heating. Two stars because it did work well before it burned up. It was installed in a 3-way configuration with a regular 3-way toggle switch on the other end."
1,This item should be recalled,"I bought five of these dimmers from HD and two of them stopped working within the first year. There are only 3 light bulbs on the dimmer and each is only 60W. Both times there was smoke coming out of the dimmer. I am surprised to see all the good review from the others. Maybe I got a bad batch. Anyway, I would stay away from these dimmers."
2,The Kindle format is terrible.,"The book itself is great, but the Kindle edition has serious formatting issues. It cuts sentences off in their middle, and in areas entire chunks of paragraph are missing, and it is only noticeable because the first sentence is missing words. I recommend this book, but not the Kindle edition."
1,Cheap plastic,"Seemed shabbily made of plastic, hard to open and fragile with the possibility of cracking when changing the cartridge - was big and bulky on the faucet - and flavored water? Plain water was what I was going for, I wanted a filter that removed taste, not added it - I returned the product and got a filtering pitcher which does not take up so much space and works like a dream. No flavors in this water."
3,to cheap,this prodect is very good but it is cheaper than the one i had before this one it was buld better.
1,Buy the Culligan filter instead and save cash and heartache,"This PUR product is bad. It is expensive as it clogged almost immediately. Then, having gone through 3 filters... it just did not work. The more I tried to change the filter, the more it leaked. Save your $$ - buy the filters one at a time - I am stuck with 3 that I will never use. The Culligan product worked first time, is so much less expensive."
1,"Was Great for Awhile, Now It's Dead, Water Spewing Out From Top","I'm so disappointed. I've had this filter for less than a year and it stopped working. I have always replaced the filters when needed, all the gaskets and adapters seem to be connected correctly, but now water spews out from around the light and where the housing screws together. Everything looks fine, but no matter what I do, the water continues to spew and doesn't seem to filter."
5,time for a new filter,"This model of filter is much better all around than their first filter.I had my old filter for 4 years before any of the seals started to leak.The new one was easier to install,looks much nicer,and doesn't get in the way,If you had an old one you know what I mean."
3,It works,Got this to replace my older Pur three stage filter. It was only a couple dollars more than the twisty style filter. The small switch and the swing away feature are nice changes but the flavor cartridge is somewhat of a joke. It works great the first couple times but after about 4 to 5 pumps you have to remove the flavor cartridge and squeeze it to get any more flavor. Other than that the filter is nice.
1,flavor filter,received item page says you gt a rasberry flavor cartledge with it and it came with lemon am not happy about it
1,doesn't do what it advertises for pure water,"The copy in Amazon talks about ""Premium filtration"". The Owners Manual, which you can see only after opening the package, clearly states ""The faucet filter is not intended to purify water. Do not use with water that is microbiologically unsafe or of unknown quality without adequate disinfection..."" That's quite a difference. Also, the flavor packet had a use by date in 2009. I'm writing this in August 2010. $45 wasted. Seller was Bradsdodads and they promptly refunded purchase price and shipping."
3,"Good concept, but not really worth it","Bought it. Used it. Loved it....at first. Not really worth it. The cover keeps popping off at the slightest touch and the flavors are just ""alright"". We ended up just slicing lemons and limes and adding them to our glasses for a much more pleasant drink."
3,Not great,"Worked great the first 4 months, then it broke, started leaking water everywhere. Other than that it worked just fine, but I expected it to last a little longer for the money I spent on it."
1,Don't buy,"1. Adds flavor to filtered water. Feels like mixed with vinegar2. Filter was installed in the bathroom and used very moderately - about 4 glasses a day. After about a WEEK electronic filter indicator staterd flashing red, and day later water stopped flowing. New filter costs 20 bucks. Means, using filter would cost $20 a week. NO, THANK YOU!"
1,Dont they test these things before they mass produce them?,"Even though I read the reviews here, just the thought of not having to buy water or juice anymore made me want to have this so bad. Sadly though these people didnt just receive a bad unit, seems like 90% or more have these leaking problem. I didnt even get to enjoy one cup of water, didnt even get to try the juice. =[ I installed this thing & its like I installed a waterfall, this thing leaked from every possible place, you know what I should have taken a picture. It was serioiusly that ridiculous, like the sprinkler cap they put on fire hydrants. I uninstalled & installed about 3 times, checking the washers, removing them & putting them back, still same thing everytime. I installed my faucets, I consider myself somewhat of a handyman so its not like this was brain surgery to me."
2,Don't buy,"Buying this filter was one of the worst mistakes I ever made. It worked fine for a week, then the stream became very slow and it kept falling off splashing water all over. Please do not buy this product."
1,slow slow filter,I timed how long it takes to fill a coffee mug with water:Filter off - Tap 1/2 on - 4 secondsFilter on - Tap full on - 50 seconds.This is not very usable or practical.
2,Not a long term solution,"From the start it leaked and after constantly adjusting the angle and the tightness I minimized the leak but did not get rid of it. It is a very cheap looking system and turned me off ever buying a faucet mount system again. It takes a bit of force to use the Flavor Option button that within a few months loosened the seal again and caused it to leak more.If you are fortunate enough not to have a leak, I can see how this can be a good system. The water did taste cleaner and the flavored water also tasted good. The filters last for quite awhile, and switching filters is quite simple.If you are looking for a long term solution, I wouldn't recommend this. It seems cheaper and I would be impressed if it would last more than two years.We are no longer using our system because the entire point of the purchase was to encourage us not to buy bottled water. That is difficult to accomplish when it leaks water every time you use it."
5,Pur water filter mount,"This is an extremely neat product but be careful because it can get very expensive. The flavor cartridges didn't even last a day at my house and at $5.00 a peice that can get really expensive. ($5.00 daily x 7 days a week= $35 weekly $140 a month)Yikes! Not to mention that several that I purchased did not work properly. I find it is much more cost effective to buy propel or the powdered flavors. Otherwise,the filter being on your faucet is great. But again, be careful because the filters are costly too."
3,A Fairly Good Product,I've been using this product for a few months now. Replaced the filter about three times. Each filter seems to run differently. The water comes out of some fast and others slow. Don't know why but the water tastes great. Don't know I'd get this model with the flavor cartridges again. They don't last as long as one would think they should.
1,PUR JUNK,"Busted and started leaking within 4 months. I was stupid and bought a dual filter refill, now I have an extra. I will update the review after I see what their warranty is like."
2,PUR flavor faucet mount,"Well, it's ok but not a lot more than that.The good news is that you don't need any tools to hook it up.But the bad news is that it took several tries to get it to remain seated.It feels a little flimsy and I worry that if anyone gets even a little heavy handed with it it will surly break. Not metal on it at all anymore...all feels like a metal balsa wood...lolOn the plus side the flavor option is nice and simple.Overall it just doesn't' seem/look/feel very sturdy for what it costs.But I'm not sorry I bought it...it works....while I'm not amazed with it I am satisfied."
1,Pur Water Filter FM-5050C,"Save your money!! This is my second Pur water filter from Proctor and Gamble. My first started leaking after 5-6 months. After complaining PG sent a coupon for a new one. My new one just started leaking. The product looks nice and functions well, but it is not well made. Once we are done with the expensive filters this unit is going in the trash. So as I said before, get something else."
3,Seemed okay when I installed it,It worked okay until it needed a new filter. My wife was unable to install the new filter successfully and the device leaked and the warning lights failed to illuminate to verify that the water was being properly filtered. I'll have to try and fix this when I get home. Hopefully there is not something wrong with the device. It was a bit expensive to toss it out with the filter after a few hundred gallons......
4,A little bulky but worth the inconvenience,"I got this for Mothers day as I drink a lot of bottled flavored water. It does not taste as sweet, but that's ok, I've aquired a taste for it now and the bottled stuff is too sweet. The system is a little bulky and makes it hard to rinse large items in my sink. It can be removed but too much bother to do so. I am going to replace my faucet w/ a higher one any way. I am the only one who uses the flavor option, so the cartridges last a while for me. I have read the reviews indicating the unit does not hold up well. Too soon for me to tell but so far I love it."
3,GOOD CHARACTER---NOT SO GOOD BOOK!!!!!!,"I have read three books about Wil Hardesty. I really like the character. That is the only reason I gave it a three. Did not really like this book. Not as good as the others I have read. A lot of this was totally unbelieveable. Also, I do not like flashbacks but am sure a lot of people do. Wil is someone I can relate to. He is not superman, he does make mistakes, he does get hurt. There are really two things Hardesty is trying to find out. Is Denny Van Zant still alive and who killed Carmen Marquez. Are they tied together??? Trina Van Zant, name is different after three marriages, leds Wil a merry chase. It all does finally get drawn to a close but I have read better by Barre."
2,"Unrealistic characters, incomprehensible plot...","Sorry, all you Barre fans, but I just don't get it. This Hardesty character seems like a cartoon to me, and the complicated plot became downright tedious after awhile. I think this author is incredibly overrated."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this book. It's 10 years old (almost), so references to studies in the 1970's and 1980's seem outdated, leading me to doubt their applicability. I found Gary Sisson's ""Hands-On Training"" much more helpful for my training needs, and a better use of my company's money."
3,"Fun, but very dated","I enjoyed this game quite a bit -- good story line and characters, mostly logical puzzles, with a bit of ""action"" thown in for good measure. Figure on no more than two or three evenings, though -- it goes very fast (good thing it's inexpensive).However, the game was made back in 1995 and in computer software years, that's the stone age. Despite the fact that the game now boasts that it's for Windows, it's really just the old Dos-based game with clunky graphics and outdated interface. I ran it on my Windows ME and it ran okay except for some intermittant sound card problems. <... play it and, if nothing else, you'll really appreciate today's gaming technology!"
5,Full Throttle 2,"I LOVE this game, and I (personally) think it's the best game EVER! I was very disappointed when I heard that Full Throttle 2: Hell on Wheels was cancelled :( and so, we'll probably never get to play a sequel of Full Throttle :(.FULL THROTTLE ROCKS!"
2,Not enough about Washington,This book is more about Mr. Weems and his odyssey trying to get the book published and people to pay for it.The actual information about George Washington is reported in a sensible manner but lacks any personality. I just don't think there's that much recorded information available in real records that was accessed by Weems.I feel I need to know more about Washington after reading Weem's book.
2,"B- movie,not a good movie","B- movie cheaply done,wouldnt give this movie away, wouldnt buy this movie again or watch it,this movie will go with my poorly done movies"
2,against the law armed response,AGAINST THE LAW IS THE BETTER OF THE TWO BUT THE ACTING WAS BAD IN BOTH. I could even act better' the story lines were very simple don't waste your time.
3,A Quick Read,"The Good: Quick read. Can pick it up and put it down again without getting lost. The hardcover I read had lots of beautiful illustrations and was very nicely done.The Bad: Can be a bit dry, feels like a dissertation about European female travel writers of the nineteenth-century at times."
4,"Pretty good, but only if your really into punk","I preety much like this Cd, but I can't say it's one of the best. My Fav. songs on it are, SideKick-Rancid, Whatever DiDi Wants-NOFX, and You make me thick-SNFU. Pennywise, the humpers, and other great Bands from epitath are also on this CD. So remember it's good for the true punk."
3,Not too bad.,"I've heard better, I've heard worse, but for four bucks, it's worth it. Besides, TSOL's song, Code Blue, is hilarious."
1,****GREAT BANDS*** Songs are all GARBAGE,"I love Punk rock, and I have a large collection of CD's..I love almost all the bands on this CD, but I STRONGLY feel that this CD is not even worth the [money]...Buy Punk-O-Rama 5,6, or a Nitro records compilation. THIS CD IS TRASHY...!!!!!!!!!!!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!,"This cd is so stupid, there is alot of stupid bands on here expect for NOFX and PENNYWISE. They put the stupid NOFX song there WHATEVER DIDI WANTS I mean come on!! the PENNYWISE song is good. There is only ONE GOOD song on there"
3,It was alright,"I wouldn't say the cd is terrible, but it could have been way better. I mean that nofx song....come on. NOFX has way better songs than the one they put on there. The cd is good to skate to but I wouldn't ever even come close to give it 5 stars....buy at your own risk."
1,Baby wipes would be better - useless for a medium or large dog,"I ordered these wipes to help clean up my german shepherd between baths. He plays outside and comes in with muddy/dirty paws at a minimum. These wipes came and were not ""bath"" wipes at all - they are about 1/2 the size of a baby wipe and have about 1/3 the moisture. Completely useless to ""bathe"" a large dog or even just clean one up. A waste of ten dollars plus shipping. A wet cloth or baby wipes would be much more efficient and a fraction of the price. These would only be useful for a puppy or a dog that fits in purse, but they would still be a complete waste of ten dollars."
1,Not what we expected,"We purchase these Bath Wipes at our local pet store and love the product. However, this online purchase delivered us a product that was dried out and useless. We will buy this product again, just not here...."
3,"Size error - each pannel is only 25""wide","These room darkening liners truly darken the room fantastically. They are VERY easy to install. That being said, the advertised size is erroneous. Each package actually contains 2 liners - each with a finished width of only 25"" (rather than the advertised 27"") - thus each package includes a total of only 50"" (erroneously advertised as a total of 54"")."
1,"A pair of 54"" panels? NO. It's a TOTAL of 54""","From the description: ""This package contains two 80x54in panels"" NO it does NOT. It contains two 27"" panels that add up to 54"" TOTAL. NOT as described AT ALL, but not worth the expense and hassle of returning, considering this is a third party seller. STRAIGHT into the donation bin they go. Thanks a lot. ARGH.UPDATE in 2011: as a helpful reviewer points out several months later, I am clearly illiterate and the description clearly states that it's two 27"" panels. Aha, that's what the description now states. However, *at the time of my purchase,* the description contained the exact text I quoted. So there, neener. :)"
3,No assembly instructions or parts list.,"Although the ad says ""minor"" assembly needed, it was more than ""minor."" No parts list or assembly instuctions are included. When I called the company to ask for directions, I was told to take it to a bicycle shop and have it done professionally."
4,amazing album,"i love this album. It's probably my second favorite of the descendents albums I have (Milo, Cool To Be You, and this) with Milo coming in first. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of 5 is because Doghouse, and Caught are both barely listenable. The other songs are all absolutely amazing. If they just chopped those two off, it'd be a 5 / 5."
5,Another Rad CD,"Descendents are like my second favorite band ever. This is a really cool CD, it's fast, melodic, and can be serious and full of humor when Milo's singing about girls and stuff like that. He was a pretty good lyricist and his voice is one of the best in the history of punk...STOP CALLING HIM WHINY! Cause he isn't and doesn't deserve to be called whiny. I really recommend this CD to anyone who's either been dumped recently or is trying to find a good early punk CD. You should either buy this or TSOL if what you're looking for is 80's music.The best songs are Everything Sux, Sick-O-Me, Thank You, and When I Get Old, but the whole thing is really rad. You should really buy this. It's good music. Also buy TSOL and the Clash because they were two good 80's punk bands."
3,DESCENDENTS IN THE 90'S,"I FELT THIS RECORD WAS WAY TO LOVEY DOVEY.IT'S LIKE MILO JUST WROTE ALL THESE SONGS TO IMPRESS HIS GIRLFRIEND,MANY GIRLS, OR WHAT NOT. OVERALL, THE LYRICS HERE ARE GOOD AND SOME OF THE SONGS ARE GOOD ALSO."
1,The title says it all........everything sucks,"when you compare this to albums like ""Milo Goes To College""....this is extremely poppy......this is radio friendly cheese pop in the same style as Blink 182....the Descendents never did have the punkest lyrics , but back in the 80's they were an extremely hyperactive band knocking out fast punk songs , most of them under 20 seconds. This album is way to commercial and cheesy , and EVERYTHING SUCKS on it."
5,What Pop/Punk Is Supposed to Sound Like,"The Descendents have remained a pop/punk band through the years, never giving up they're loud original sound. Being the inspiration to many bands (examples being: Blink 182, The Ataris) is what first attracted me to this great band, and then I found out that Milo Aukerman (Vocals) is a scientist. I was like ""Whoa, how awesome is that?!"" Standout tracks include ""I'm the One"", ""When I get Old"", and ""Sick-O-Me"". ""She Loves me"" is another song that appeals to me, not just for the outstanding instrumentals, but the lyrics are what first appealed to me. It shows both sides of love: the good kind and the bad. This CD shows off some of Milo's greatest lyrics to date. This CD deserves way more than 5 stars. Buy it!"
4,"Not Popular Punk, but Pop Punk!!!","This band defenatly falls under the genre of punk with pop elements. Thats not a bad thing either, there are many bands out there that succesfully pull this off. Ill make this breif, all the songs are good. Buy this, you'll be happy you did, this is what pop punk (or punk in general) should sound like. Enough Said."
5,Very nice Shocks,I have had these on my explorer for about a month and absoulutley love them. No longer does a gust of wind push me around. The rear end sag is completley gone and the only time that you notice that these are heavy load shocks are really high speed bumps and huge pot holes. I like these so well i am ordering the same shocks for my wife's grandcaravan
1,"Well, they sent the right size and color, BUT...","While I was amazed to find that I was sent the right COLOR and SIZE, I was not too happy to find that the inside of the waist band WAS NOT covered in cloth and that the elastic pinched and rubbed. Not too good of a sensation."
3,Don't expect online marketing tactics!,"I linked to ""Guerrilla Marketing"" on Amazon from another site that claimed this book was updated with information on Internet guerrilla marketing, which is why I bought it. This is true, if you count the fewer than 6 pages written in 1997 or 1998 to be an update. I guess I should have checked the copyright date before I made the purchase. Two of the six pages about online marketing contain statistics about the pervasity of the Web using data from 1994-1997 and predictions about what would be happening in 2000. The book also contains information that just looks dated today, such as ""Should you buy a car phone?"" and marketing via fax and voicemail. There's no question that this is still the bible for non-traditional marketing, but in my opinion, it needs a major overhaul for freshness. I learned nothing I didn't know already about online marketing."
1,"Dull, Outdated, and Uninspired","Jay Conrad Levinson presents his thesis clearly time and time again in his book. In fact, he presents everything again and again. Each thought it reinforced at least 4 times in a dry and uninspired manner. Although Levinson tries to present marketing tactics that only a small business can use, he ends up presenting large-business tactics at a small scale. This book leaves out ground which has been broken by Loyalty Based marketing tactics, and sticks to traditional measures that are hardly relevant (at best) to entrepreneurs. The bottom line: invest your money elsewhere."
4,"Good book, but not Internet savvy","This is a good book. It applies mostly to people doing business locally (as opposed, say, to a manufacturer or software company selling worldwide), but business people of all stripes will still benefit. My main complaint about the book is its lack of Internet marketing advice -- a critical ""weapon"" of marketing in this day and age."
3,Read this book,"THis book lays out for you all the techniques that you need for marketing your business. It gives the up to date methods used and how to get your product out there. Along with Guerrilla PR Wired by Michael Levine, this book is a must have."
3,Has some good points,This book is not much different than a college marketing class with the addition of shameless promotion throughout. On the other hand the book also reminded me of many areas and tactics that I had forgotten.
3,So So Book: For Beginners Only,"If you've got formal training in marketing, avoid this book. It lays down some basic tenets of marketing you probably already understand. What I was looking for in it was some practical advice for small businesses and some innovative ideas. Most of what I found I had already discerned through common sense. There's nothing terribly creative or innovative in his ideas.Here's the summary: learn the basic principles of marketing, use common sense, be persistent and frugal, and work hard.If you haven't had any formal marketing training this might be a place to start, but even then, I'd recommend a basic marketing text first. Learn the ""3 C's"" and ""4 P's"" of marketing before you spend your money on Guerilla Marketing."
4,Wonderful book,I had just started my own business and heard about this book on Dave Ramsey's show. I bought the book and found that it had a lot of great ideas about how to reach new customers and ways to keep existing ones.I highly recommend this book for anyone starting a small business.
1,An Insult to the Music,"The only passable sections in this otherwise awful DVD are the interviews that show Netrebko as a vivacious and beautiful woman who is still trying to cope with sudden stardom. The five lip-synced arias are an absolute outrage. Staged like second rate fashion shows, they are a pinnacle of bad visual taste and an insult to the music. The director of that piece, Vincent Paterson, should perhaps stay with his former subjects, Madonna and Michael Jackson. Don't waste your money on this DVD, buy one of Netrebko's CDs instead."
2,Not worthy of DGG,"Beautiful talent, voice and woman, -all done a great disservice by this triumph of a lack of style over a lack of content. What was the music? I was barely aware of it. I wonder if she was pressured into this nonsense by her agent or by sheer naivete? A DVD should make you relish the prospect of your next viewing.... This one won't be seen again by me! The interviews should have been consolidated into one section, - I don't want to hear about her shopping expeditions etc again.When will the post-MTV generation of directors realise that gimmicks DETRACT and BELITTLE?"
2,MOULIN ROUGE-y grotesque,"Gaudy and freakish. No...worse!Anya still manages to be stunning...until she opens her mouth in the interview portion. The more she talked the more pretentious she seemed. Any positive rating I give this DVD is due to Anya's beauty and singing and acting -- nothing else.To add insult, the menu is confusing. To play the entire film as intended, with interview and introductions for each aria, you want the third selection -- not the top one.There are lots of extras to be found on this DVD - but that doesn't include the mouthwash you might feel you need afterwards."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this for my daughter to use with her laptop when she goes to college, I knew that it was a small printer, and used a special paper, but I thought the paper was normal size. Not happy@all!"
1,Portable printer,Almost useless. Could not get it to work with IR. No drivers for system. No tech support. It is almost worthless. It arrived used and was supposed to be new. Could not return. Hope to get it to work with something.
5,Best Chinese Reader,"This series(you will need to read beginning Chinese reader first) is wonderful. It slowly leads you from one character to another, before you know it , and without much struggle, you know more than you ever dreamed possible. If you buy used make sure the editions of book 1 and book 2 match or you might miss some chapters. BUY IT!"
1,dog brush,Spend your money on something else. REALLY! Trust me on this one. This is so silly and really has no valueas far as helping with shedding. My dog sheds very little and this product didn't help in any way. I'm not sure what will help but if your going to try a new product go with something else.
5,Best Microdermabrasion Ever!,This is an excellent product. It's easy on your face and softens fine lines. It makes my face feel fresh and new!
4,Growing uo in coal country,Very good book with photos that tell a of a time period all but forgotten.
2,A Little Disappointing,"While the descriptions of quilt making are fascinating, I found myself questioning the characterization. Personalities tend to adapt their outlooks to make a sweet ending without credibility."
5,Quilting Novel,"If your a quilter and love everything about quilting , you will love this book. It is part of a series by Jennifer chiaverini."
4,You Don't have to be a Quilter,"The book is set in a quilting ""camp"", and much of the action involves quilting, but it is a book about building and maintaining frienships. The characters are well drawn, each with their own quirks and foibles; some nicer than others. You will learn a lot about quilting, about relationships, and wish it hadn't ended when you reach the last page. Luckily, this is the first of a series, so you can read more about these people in the next book."
2,It could have been better...,"As a person who someday would like to learn how to quilt, I enjoyed the scenes in which Sarah was being taught. The flashback scenes were also poignant. But, this book truly suffered from a lack of depth. The characters were not well developed enough, and though you desired to know more about them, by the end of the book, you were still left wondering. The ending wrapped up in a neat, yet predicatable package."
2,Wasn't able to finish reading The Quilter's Apprentice,"While enjoying the Elm Creek Quilt series overall, I was disappointed with The Quilter's Apprentice. I downloaded it to my Kindle twice and both times was unable to get past page 1551. I returned the first download for a refund and deleted the 2nd after doing everything that Amazon told me to try and still not being able to view the rest of the book on my Kindle. While the book was intriguing up to the point that I could read, I would have to say I was very disappointed in the overall performance of this particular download."
1,Mending Fences,I enjoyed the process of story telling as the quilt was assembled and new life returned to the manor. I would love to be one of those quilters taking advantage of such beautiful grounds and so many talented quilters to boot.
2,Cardboard Characters,I have been a quilter for many years. The people described in this novel do not characterize the people I have met in my experience with quilters. I found the drama flat as well as the characters. There are much better books about quilters available both fiction and non-fiction.
3,Enjoyable as pleasure reading,I liked this book because I'm a crafter myself and have not seen many books that incorporate the art of crafts into fiction. I liked the folk tales about quilt patterns and how they were woven into (no pun intended!) the story of a beautiful old estate with an interesting family history. I enjoyed the historical mixed in with the contemporary. It would have been GREAT to have some character development. We don't really get to know much about Matt and Sarah at all.Looking forward to starting the next book.
4,Great Cabin Read,I enjoyed the story and character lines of this book so much I am collecting the entire series for my guest room library. I live on a lake and this is a book I want to share with my guests.
5,The Quilters Apprentice,"Enjoyable, well written as all of her books are. The story holds your interest to the end. Plan to read more from this author."
2,The Quilter's Apprentice: A Novel,"Although this book was rated well by other readers and quilters, I found it to be only a 'nice story' written at the level of middle-school readers. I kept waiting for the story content to have some depth and hoped that the conversations would be more meaningful, but that didn't happen. Since I was so disappointed with the book, I couldn't recommend it to any of my quilting friends. I donated it to the local library with a note that it was for those who read at the 6th to 8th grade level."
4,Awkward but good,"This first book in the Elm Creek series is not the best writing I've seen, but the story is fun and it's a pleasurable book. I found it difficult to put it down, and was anxious to read the next book in the series (which is better than the first, in both writing technique and style). I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves quilting and light reading!"
4,Predictable but Sweet,"Sarah McClure and her husband Matt move to a small Pennsylvania town for his new landscape architecture job. One of his clients is the prickly Mrs. Compson, who offers the still-jobless Sarah a position cleaning up her mansion for sale. Sarah asks that the old master quilter give her lessons in addition to her compensation. As they work on Sarah's quilt, Mrs. Compson tells her family's history of love, jealousy and betrayal. Sarah comes across as a bit whiny and the ending is very predictable, but still a good read for a rainy afternoon."
2,"Good subject, weak plot.","Although I love quilts and quilting, I found this novel to be shallow and predictable. I almost felt like I had picked up something my middle-school daughter might read--flat characters and obvious plot turns."
4,Sarah's Quilt,I really enjoyed The Quilters Apprentice. I am recomending it to my Quilter friends. My only complaint is that I wanted to see the finished block and Quilt. I've ordered Round Robin and I'm sure I'll want to see that quilt too.
3,Elm Creek book,"I know I got a great price for the paperback book, but it was a bit more tattered than expected. There was a big black mark across the side of the book and the back cover had a deep crease in it. If I had gone to a used bookstore, I would not have purchased this particular book, as I wanted it as part of my Elm Creek collection. I did enjoy the book though!"
2,"The good, the bad and....","Well, this book is hard to rate. If you are a quilter or want to be a quilter it can be interesting as it introduces the reader to various aspects of quilting albeit a bit too detailed and, at the same time, not detailed enough.The plot, while slow moving, does carry the reader along to the end.The characters, now that is what is suspect. The young married couple, Sarah and Matthew sound like 16 year olds in their dialogue and yet they have been out of college for several years and both have professional degress. In fact, Sarah, is an accountant although she is sophmoric in her speech pattern. Mrs. Compson, starts off curmudgeonly but evolves into a genuinely likeable character. Nevertheless, the dialogue between her and the ""children"" are a distraction. Trite, hackneyed.... If the reader has time to overlook the dialogue shortcomings, then the book is interesting."
4,Quite Satisfying,"As a quilter, I loved this book. I was not ready to part with the characters. I especially enjoyed the parallels of the chapters unfolding to the sampler quilt block chosen. My only criticism was that the ending was wrapped up just a little too perfectly for my taste. I hope to be able to visit with the Tangled Web Quilters again."
4,Loved it!!,"I am a quilter and a writer and I thoroughly enjoyed how Chiaverini incorporated quilting techniques/terms and the characters' story. It made me want to join a local quilt guild. Very interesting, well written and a quick read."
3,great for the first easy days of solids intro,"but not so great after the menu becomes more elaborate. Just too much of a pain to clean the straps,rims of the tray, and all of the crevasses in the cushion - food gets deaply set in and when you feed a messy 10 month old 4 - 6 times a day - that's all you do - clean up. We are going to just get a simple wooden swedish highchair now that he is older and just consider this a lesson learned. Granted the wheels are great - it's comfy, etc but the cons outway the pros for us."
5,Great high chair,"Easy to wheel around, cleaning isn't a big deal and the different chair positions are great. We've used it for two kids at various baby/toddler stages. Worth the money."
2,a pain to clean,"We found this to be comfortable for our child as she went from infant to toddler. However, it is a pain to clean. It is very difficult to get in by the armrests and in the seat cushion. Once we removed the cushion it never snapped on correctly. The cushion did not hold up well at all. It ripped in several places, and the replacements are expensive. A higher end cushion is almost half the prce of the chair."
1,No good,"Bad points: 1) can't lower/raise your child in relation to the tray b/c the tray is attached to the chair. Only the chair raises and lowers; not the tray. Our 6 mo. old is swallowed up in this chair--and she's big--18 lbs. 26 inch baby. But I can't get her high enuf to where she can put her hands on the tray. She feels swallowed up by it and hates it. 2) difficult to clean--gotta dig down in the nooks and crannies. A pain, and grimy food in there makes the chair smell--gross! 3) big gap between kid and tray only exacerbates food-in-the-cranny problem. It falls on kid and tray doesn't catch it. 4) kind of complicated to fold up. You have to follow a certain order of buttons, and it's just like, when will they come up with a 1 touch system? Good point: it folds up so you can tuck it away in kitchen or behind door. I would NOT RECOMMEND this chair. Stay simple and CHEAP! Buy used! From a parent with two kids."
3,Good if you already know leathercraft,"This book is best used by someone who already has some leathercraft projects under his belt. Building on this assumed knowledge, the book covers the things you need to know about constructing western saddles, such as buying tools/supplies, construction techniques, etc."
3,Surprised to Find I Wasn't Wowed,"I expected to like this book more than I did. I could tell from the blurb on theinside flap that it is my favorite ""type"" of novel, with a female protagonistand a difficult love situation. I loved the beautiful poetry of the writing. Ididn't find the story felt true, however."
4,Interesting...I think,"This was another spur of the moment purchase just to qualify for free shipping. Quite honestly, the book is average. It is great in some parts and boring and rambling in others. I felt it was unbalanced in a sense due to the fact that it spent so much time during the girls childhood and then I felt it rushed to a somewhat disappointing finish. Overall, it was a unique story, which is a plus! I would recommend this book if you are looking for a story like no other..."
4,"Like Shredded Wheat: Good for you, but a bit dry","Cooper's book does a good job of making us think about what is too frequently overlooked about our own potential for success. There are enough anecdotes included that it's likely most readers can find someone/something to identify with...and hopefully turn that identification into motivation. My one complaint is that, like many self-help books, ""The Other 90%"" makes for a somewhat dry read. I'd suggest keeping a copy of Stilton Jarlsberg's ""WHO CUT THE CHEESE?"" (the hilarious parody of Spencer Johnson's ""Who Moved My Cheese?"") close at hand to add a little levity to the mix."
2,A Very Mixed Bag,"The Other 90% starts off with some very good ideas and ambitions. No one can argue with trying to get more out of life. But this book suffers from a lack of reasoning.For example, on page 55 the author says that he wished when people said ""hello"" they would ""honor the greatest in each other"" and that ""every human being has greatness inside."" But just two pages later he admits ""he who praises everybody praises nobody.""Perhaps the author was thinking with his heart or gut, two other organs he believes as capable of thought as the brain.For those who really want to unlock the ""other 90%"" in their lives, I'd recommend ""Atlas Shrugged"" by Ayn Rand instead."
4,"Good Read, Great Concepts","This was an easy read, with great concepts. I have applied some of the things in this book, and I am all the better because of it. I recomend this in the personal library....a reference book to keep us on track."
3,It's a Myth,"It's an OK book, but for the record, no modern-day, reputable scientist believes the myth that people only use 10% of their brain power. That went out with the flat-earth theory. With the exception of people who perpetuate these myths, most of us are running close to capacity."
3,Good Read,"I find this book a good read, although it has some points which are not easy to comprehend personally.I would still recommend to others."
3,The book was good but.....,I felt the author could have contributed more to the content. Giving basic over-views of personalities and some testing results are good but the book misses the mark somewhere. It really doesn't get into the meat of the matter.
2,Taking the Author's Advice,"One part of the book urges the reader to be truthful and avoid hypocrisy. I will take that advice and disagree with the positive reviews I have read.This book lacks the focus necessary to impact most readers' lives in a significant way. If you benefit from books that contain scores of miscellaneous suggestions and tips, you might be the exception. After finishing the book, however, I felt as if I had read through a stack of one and two-page articles from Reader's Digest. Many of the tidbits were interesting. Taken together they provided little that I will remember or use.Based on the very positive reviews I had read, I expected much more substance."
3,A Little Too Far in the Clouds,"I've been on a bit of an ""improve myself"" kick over the past few months, which made me hopeful that Dr. Cooper's book would give me some insights about how I can become a better husband/father/lawyer/employer/friend. Dr. Cooper offers some very nice stories about himself and his grandfather, all of which lead to a conclusion that each of us has the ability to improve ourselves and our interactions with others through an ongoing effort to look for mutually serving solutions that are consistent with our own ideals. While Dr. Cooper writes well and presents a very admirable premise that would help most people feel more fulfilled, I didn't find anything that has not already been covered by others and gained few insights that I could readily use to solve daily problems. I have few major qualms with Dr. Cooper's book, but cannot wholeheartedly endorse it as an investment in productivity."
1,Waste of Money!,"Bought at Walmart because I wanted something to broadcast to my radio, bad idea. Almost never works unless its a couple inches away from the antenna. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1,SUCKS!!!,"I bought this at walmart thinking I was getting a good deal, but as the last commenter said, it is full of flaws, u have to keep on adjusting it around the faceplate of the radio, it sucks, Literally"
1,item never came,"I ordered a transmitter, they sent me a charger. Now they want me to send it back. I dont have time for that. They should have sent me the right item to start. if they know whats good for them, they will just send the right item now!!Too bad.SAM"
5,Ten Foot Pole Kix @$$!!,"Now this is some GOOD Punk. Their singer doesnt have an annoying raspy voice like some punk bands and they have an awsome drummer. I heard of them fromm a.d.d. off of ""Punk O Rama 3"" also their song on 1 and 2. This is a must get!"
1,Not Happy,"I purchased this jacket and it did not meet my expectations, I thought it was ugly. So I returned it about four weeks ago and my account still has not been credited. I am very displease with this service from your company."
3,A complex book,"This book is very ""heady"". I usually really like Thomas Merton's writings, but this particular book required a lot of thought to try to understand what the author was expressing."
1,NOT A MONITOR MOUNT!!!!,"This is advertised and pictured as an arm to mount a monitor, for instance to a desk. What I liked about it was having 4 joints instead of the usual 3. It says it includes a ""monitor mount"". What it has is a screw - so you can screw in a camera. I cannot find any adapter - for instance a VESA100 adapter with a screw-in. So how can you actually put a monitor on this???? In the picture it has 2 black rectangles beneath the monitor. I don't know what those are - but they were not included. The one page 'instructions' that come with it point to the last joint with the screw as the monitor mount. Sell it for what it is a camera mount."
3,"Great novel, unclear on whether this version is good","Cannot vouch for this particular version of the book, but get a good copy somewhere, as it is worth it. If you like Kundera, have a fondness for Nietzsche, enjoyed the Bill Murray movie ""Groundhog's Day,"" or sit there mulling over the towering pronouncement from Rilke's ""Archaic Torso of Apollo,"" : 'You must change your life!' then this is the book for you. Even if none of the above apply to you, just take a chance on this slim novel. While I wouldn't recommend the entire mystical theosophist movement that propelled Ouspensky, this work will never quite leave you -- my criterion for a work of great art."
5,An Excellent Book,"As soon as I read the first page of this book I loved it. I heard it's the book that the movie ""Goundhog Day"" was inspired by."
2,So So...,"I was expecting something great from this book - it came up far short. Consistent with the other reviews, there were quite a few editing errors that I found in this book (which does not say much because I am not very big on grammar). While the last few pages were rewarding, overall the book was quite drab. Do yourself a favor however, read the back cover of the book where the guy who directed Groundhog Day comments on the book - it is an amazing commentary and will sum the entire book up in a paragraph."
3,tom wolf a man in full,have not read the book..but tom wolf `s book A MAN IN FULL refers to it and if it is good enough to mention in this book on EPICTITUS...It`s worth taking a chance on dermott
3,Depends on what you are looking for,"Overall I found this to be a good book that just kept coming up a bit short.This is one of those books where the information is there, but the format is lacking.Poor printing of lackluster photographs doesn't help this guide. If you are looking for different varieties of plants, they are here, but you can get the same information reading garden catalogs in January.I liked the index of plants, however, splitting the common names into a separate index did not make sense to me. Reading the book I had to have on finger in the scientific nomenclature and one marking the common name list as well. I was running out of fingers!What I did like was the suggested combinations of plants although I thought the somewhat sophisticated color combinations were not explained well enough to allow for experimentation outside the plants stated for many readers."
5,Great Gardening Book,This was recommended to me from my landscape architect... it is probably one of the best gardening know-how books on the market.
3,Don't love it,"I wanted to, but I just didn't love this. I think gardeners need books targeted to their zones. Plant combinations may be beautiful, but if the plant won't grow in your zone, it's useless. The author definitely knows her stuff, however."
3,Warning: not for the beginner,"This is indeed a fine work for its time. However, if you are not alredy experienced in reading hieroglyphics, then you won't catch all the mistakes made by the late Sir Wallis Budge. This doesn't mean it is entirely useless, though. Those who ridicule Budge for his flawed interpretations fail to take into account that he wrote over a hundred years ago. I would recomend this to the serious student, but beware of the little flaws and mistakes that would make a professor shudder."
4,The Only BD's Dictionary as yet,"It is nice to count with an ordered and clear vocabulary to the Theban recension of the BD, the more so when there is no other similar work in the market. Readers of Budge know him very well, so that warnings against his sometimes carelesness in transcribing the hieroglyphs and the old ways of transliterating them are unnecessary. Pay attention to the meanings of the terms: most of them are in bad need of a revision, but if the reader has more actual dictionaries (such as Faulkner's or Lesko's) there is no way to be mistaken. A great but rather out-of-date work, which must be used carefully by the beginners. For those engaged in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, a must and a doorway to understand better one of the most ancient religious texts of Humankind."
3,aztec ripoff,"This book, created during a period in which Forgotten Realms were focused on using actual historical periods - for example, the Moonshae Islands were based on the Irish/celtic druidic culture while Crusade were based on Attila the Hun and his invasion of China and Eastern Europe. Since then, Forgotten Realms had become embarassed about those regions in its early attempts into fantasy since they didn't reprint them or even went back to the most exotic lands. Maztica were based on the invasion of Aztec culture by Spain explorers - even the power rivality between powerful people in aztec is based in this book. Then the crashing down of the Aztec civilization is also taken in accord in this book.Other than that, there were so much holes in the plot, bland character interactivity, and facts that doesn't add up, like orcs created from maztica warriors when later in forgotten realms they were brought to the world by Gruumsh One Eye."
4,I enjoyed it.,"Some have complained that this is a mirror of what happened in reality when Cortez sailed for the Americas. I found this to be a strength of the book. Picking out the parallels was part of the fun of the story. I found myself rooting for the heroes and cursing the villains. Mr. Niles wove an entertaining tale, and when I finished the book, I immediately picked up the sequel and started reading. Well done!"
1,bad bad bad,"The historical aspect is a rip-off. Names are changed, but the premise is totally unoriginal. Also, I felt betrayed when the characters who started out as 'cool' turned out to be crazy, violent individuals who suddenly didn't make sense in the story or world such as a Dwarf who didn't have a problem with his army slaughtering children. The general who we're supposed to hope succeeds leads an army of child/women killers. And, the whole trilogy seems to say the evil guys are OK because they're the 'civilized' ones. There are plenty of better Forgotten Realms novels out there. Save yourself some time and skip this series."
3,HARD TO PUT AWAY,Douglas Niles has the right stuff to get the job done. He mixes the magic with the adventure to create a thrilling ride. I need to capture Book 2.
3,Great sound on a disapointing CD,"This compilation is live performances for Command Performance radio shows. Her voice is great, the bands are tight but I wish they would have said that it was live performances. They just can't match the recordings and I had been hoping to get an actual studio recorded version of Arthur Murray Taught Me Dancing In A Hurry. I give it 3 stars because Betty Hutton rules!"
5,Contents...,"It all happened so quickly. Hallie and her mother and father had lived comfortably and happily in California. Hallie had loved everything about her life. And then her mother was killed in an accident and her father injured, so much so that the doctor recommended that he go away. And so they were on a Christmas tree farm in Montana. Instead of a pleasant school, Hallie only had correspondence courses; instead of many friends, she had only crippled Birdie and the old Indian, Black Thunder.Yet it all seemed worth it after Hallie found Sasha. He was a wolf pup whose mother had been killed by hunters. He was like a dog, at first and even after he had almost matured. He was company.The author has made the lonely magic of the Montana wilderness as alive and acceptable to the reader as it became to Hallie.Drawings by Richard L. Shell"
3,Meh,"I love the corkscrew and foil cutter; this is at least the 4th set I've gotten to give as a small present. But I specifically ordered this item because it said it as the ""table model gift set"" and the picture showed the plastic stand to hold the corkscrew and foil cutter, and they came as separate pieces. I have the set with the plastic stand and it makes it possible to set this on a shelf in my wine cabinet instead of having to scrounge for it in a drawer. If I can find the set, I'll return this, but it is a stocking stuffer for my son and if I can't find the one I want, i'll keep it...in my opinion, this corkscrew is a kitchen necessity...in the 40 years I've been opening wine bottles, this is the best corkscrew I've ever used."
4,Be on purpose to read this book,"The way this book is written is a little lame and kinda slow to get in to, but stick with it. it really does have good ideas! It has ways to get yourself organized, set personal goals and make your life less stressful by developing a simple method to set priorities in your life. Stick with it to reap the benefits; they're worth it!"
2,This book won't change your life,"The On-Purpose person is written as a story. A seeker encounters a series of on-purpose people who give him advice and guidance about how to change his life. Essentially he is told to prioritize his ""wants"" and decide on a ""core purpose"" for his life. The wants are of course subordinate to the core purpose, which is a way of serving others. For example: ""I serve others by showing them the beauty of nature.""Once the seeker has established his wants, put them in order of importance, and decided on his core purpose, which has a religious basis (it is God's purpose for him), he is on his way to becoming an on-purpose person. Throughout the book, the on-purpose persons use the metaphor of tennis - oddly enough.The book has a cultish quality but little substance. It is similar to a typical (but old-fashioned) book on how to organize your life. These books invariably advised the reader to have a goal, prioritize his desires, and so on.I wouldn't waste your time on this."
2,The so-so ideas are stifled in a poor story line,"Why does the author choose to force a non-fiction book into very uninteresting fiction? This book could have been more compact and concise. I did not find the ideas that helpful; they were a bit too complicated to realistically implement (for my lifestyle.) Some people may benefit from the ideas in this book. If you are reading it for the plot, don't bother. It is not worth your time. If you are reading it as a self help book, you will have to ignore the dribble that is the plot and glean what you can from what is left over. The author is incredibly optimistic with how much these tips will change your life. His enthusiasm for his own ideas is evident."
1,....,If you're looking to waste your time reading almost 70% of a book before it makes a hard right turn into Jesusville; then this is the book for you. If you're looking for something with some substance; best to look elsewhere.
2,"Good Ideas-but ""borrowed from others"" & not well written","The ideas and approach to creating your purpose are simple which I thought was good. Nothing new here, it is a rehash of other authors: Covey, Canfield etc...The ""tournament"" idea is something taken directly from ""The Power of Focus"" by Jack Canfield. One big difference between the other authors and this book is the ""parable"" approach. While it could potentially make for interesting reading (perhaps like the Celestine Prophecy) the author is not a good writer/story teller. So enduring the story makes the message difficult. The final thing is that even if you do like the book and want to use the authors approach, the forms (free and for sale) for creating/discovering your purpose available at his external website are .exe files-not pdf. Sorry mac, kindle, iPad, iPhone, it seems the author's purpose does not include helping you."
2,Not really helpful,"this is more cheesy than ""who moves my cheese"". I gave a try because it was free with amazon prime. It is written for kids. It lacks intellectual challenge. Life is not about flowcharts, following scripts. This is totally opposite to following and living in the moment. Planning your day, choosing ""with your thoughts"" who you are, and everything else in the book, it sounds to me the best way to actually distance yourself from who you really are.I does not help me at all. Let's stop forcing ourselves to be ""someone"" and have a purpose. Life has no meaning, it has no purpose, and that's the beauty of it. Those trying to find its meaning and purpose just don't know how to connect with it.It may help others, those that need a cooking recipe to follow their dreams and make sense of their lives.Sorry not for me."
1,Painful,"This book is painful to read to anyone reading above a fourth grade level. I don't know why people seem to love these badly written motivational fables -- if there's a positive message in here, there's no chance I'm going to hear it above the deafening sucking noise of the writing. It reads like Eckhart Tolle fanfiction by a high schooler. If you love this, by all means buy The Energy Bus, another mind-numbingly bad fable presenting life advice in cringe worthy fictional format."
1,Couldn't hold me,I found it hard to keep my attention. The only reason for the rating is because I did not get far in the book.
3,Curious,"This book is filled with interesting facts. Unfortunately, it is written like a college text and is far too technical for casual reading. It is truly a formidable study of the role of women in the context of the mafia. Fascinating but not for the casual reader."
4,"Perfect translation, but don't read it too often","ok, the translation was perfect, i have nothing to complain, the images all looked good and stuff, but one problem. I got this manga and i liked it and read it just a bit too much and soon the pages started falling out. my advice, get the manga, but be a bit careful when you read it, and definetly dont open it wide!!!"
4,"Great manga, so-so translation","Sakura continues her journeys as a Cardcaptor in the secondvolume. Most fourth-graders have to worry about homework, Sakura hasto worry about mischievous magical entities. There is a ton of actionand regular CCS goodness in the second volume, but the translationcould've been better. Mixx continues to use their modified names,(i.e.: ""Toya"" instead of ""Touya,"" ""Yuki""instead of ""Yukito""), the pages still look like they werexeroxed from the original, etc. That and that the original Japanesevolumes are more than twice as cheaper. If you can overlook these tinyflaws, this is a must buy. Of course, if you already bought the firstvolume, then you probably already know that."
2,Is bad enough is poorly dub on KidsWB,"While the Mixx translation is okay, I like the billangue alot better(I know is misspell, sorry)Not only is the quality of the artwork is far better, but so is the translation. It cost more, like about ... but is worth it since its a closer if not better then the orignial version. And plus you get to see the Kanji too. And I also don't think Mixx care about they customers, if they did, they manga would be alot better in terms of quality and translation. But don't let my review turn you off from reading Card Captor Sakura manga and seeing the anime, please either find the billangue which is located at Japanese bookstore or watch the subtitle version by Pioneer"
4,Updated Win2k driver is an improvement,"I'm updating a review I posted back November where I completely trashed this sound card on the basis of bad Windows 2000 drivers. I'm happy to admit that there is finally an updated driver for this card..., and it seems to have resolved the problems I faced earlier (frequent system crashes, loud humming, etc.)I hope I will finally be able to enjoy the full potential of this card, considering its steep price and the earlier distress I went through. All things considered, I'm still only giving a new 4 star rating -- because there should never have been a bad driver released in the first place..."
2,"Great hardware, poor software?","Purchased card from ""used"" sales (Final Call auction through Amazon) and I may know why it was returned the first time. I wanted this card to work based on all of the reviews I had read, however I could not get it to work in my machine. New drivers, several calls to tech support produced no results. I think the biggest problem was the driver/software package-the card itself was recognized by Windows with no hassles. My call - buyer beware, Phillips needs to work on their code writing. By the way, kudos to Final Call, they handled the return and refund on my credit card with no hassles!"
1,Constantly crash while playing games with WinXP,"This card constantly causes my Dell 8300,2.8Ghz to crash while playing games (Max Payne 1&2). Downloaded and installed latest driver (version 1.89) still does not help! Other than that the card is OK for other things. I would appreciate if someone come up with fix for this! Thanks."
1,2-Channel output failed,"I went over it and over it with technical support, but the card would not put out stereo two-channel sound correctly under Windows 2000. I got a kind of mono sound output, with the right channel on the left, and no balanced right."
3,Not as good as I thought it was going to be,"I read puzzle island by this same author, and that book was amazing,....,full of puzzles, mystery and clues to solve the mystery. This book had a very cute story, and beautiful illustrations, but only had one question at the end, so I was a little disappointed. No one's fault really, but I was just expecting more."
5,Great Book,"Beautifully illustrated book. My toddlers favourite, every picture is packed with hidden animals, creatures and plants. Will be keeping this one stored away when the kid is too big to read it."
4,Interesting,"If you have any interest in Irish history or of the Irish language, then this book is for you.Joyce quite obviously is a Gaelic scholar and this comes across in his assertions that so much of the English we speak today does in fact come from Irish. Joyce lived through the Famine and his knowledge of his contemporary Ireland is like wiping the dust from an old mirror and seeing your grandfathers reflection.Bhí sin go maith. It was well and good."
2,Thermoscan filters,"I ordered these filters because I needed them for my Thermoscan. I should have been wary of the words ""fits Braun Thermoscan"". That means they are not ""made for"" it. Yes, they did fit, but boy, were they inferior! The plastic was so flimsy they crinkled and crushed between my fingers. I threw them out and ordered filters from another seller - filters that were ""made for"" the Braun Thermoscan!"
4,Good Value,"This is a lot of caps for the money. Arrived quickly and fit perfectly. The plastic is a lighter weight than the Braun covers, but I don't think it affects the quality of the product. Happy with product I received."
3,Decent Covers.,"I had ordered these lens caps for our Braun thermometer about a year ago. They did seem like a good deal, 300 caps for $27 + shipping. When I received them, I was disappointed a bit as they weren't as sturdy as the original 20 pack I got with the thermometer but the thought of saving money made me start using them. However, these function the same as the more expensive ones, in the sense that they are there to protect the lens of dirt and ear wax. In that, these have functioned exactly as the more expensive ones. I'm a bit surprise that we have gone thru almost the whole shipment in the past year but when the kids are small and the flu bug hits the whole family, I was glad that I saved money on these rather than go with the more expensive pieces. I've started browsing again to purchase some more and hence wanted to give my 2 cents (ok it's more than that) when I came across here. Overall, worth the money saved."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,Not sure if it was the fact that I was making an international call on a cell phone from a hotel conference romo or the Polycom itself. The person I called couldn't understand what we were saying and ultimately had to hang up. Could have been the fact that it was an international call though.
2,The buzzing will kill you,"After 6 months of using this everyday, I have decided to replace it. The buzzing sound is terrible, at times blocking out the conversation. It gets worse when you use the mute button. The internet reports this as a known problem with the ""new"" ones being improved. I somehow doubt it - don't buy one.."
5,perfect for small office - bluetooth skype and mobile phone connection,"Fantastic product for anyone that wants to conference via skype or cell/mobile phone.The bluetooth function works reliably whether connecting to my macbook or iphone.Note this device does not have a auto switching power supply, the 120v version self destruct if you use with 220/240v.Works well with a 50w 240 -120v step down transformer"
5,Great Phone!,We bought this phone for use in our conference room at work. Everybody is very pleased with the sound quality and range. Highly recommended for a conference room.
5,Nearly Perfect,"Works so well I often have people in my office instead of having to find a conference room. Works with bluetooth and analog beautifully! No cell phone buzz!Only thing I wish worked was auto-discovery when I walk into my office, but given the range (my cell phone stays conected for almost 100 feet when I walk out of my office) this is probably impractical."
2,Speaker makes hiss when unit is off,Didn't try out the Bluetooth features. Unit is similar to Polycom Voicestation 300 except for the additional Bluetooth capability. Speaker makes a low hiss when the unit is off. See my review for the Voicestation 300. Returned to Amazon.
1,Doesn't work with Android phones,"We purchased this device with the intent of using it in our company conference room with the company phones. All the company phones are Motorola Droids. Come to find out after the purchase that these devices have a problem pairing with Android phones. As such, it's useless to us. I'm sure it's a great device if you aren't using it with Android phones, but that's a pretty big flaw in my opinion. I feel sorry for the IT guy who gets stuck supporting one of these when a visitor's phone won't pair with it."
4,History Comes Alive,"(...) An insightful and interesting study of four generations of complex and often contradictory personalities. I especially appreciated the author's manner of hinting at future developments and bating the reader to read on and on...in my case, well into the night. His analysis of the Adams' strengths and weaknesses is what sets this book apart so I am perplexed that anyone would describe it as dull and a mere listing of events. But don't take my word for it -- if you have only a few moments to browse through it, check the index for the passage dealing with the death of the tragic first generation daughter, Nabby. The writing is poignant and wrenching. Anything but routine."
2,Unsung Heros,"I returned this book upon reviewing it because I was looking for opportunities and ideas on training my new siezure alert dog. I have trained one before w/o the use of any manuals, but I thought it might show some insight on overcoming roadblocks in relation to the dog training.This particular book turned out to be something a teacher would use in an elementary school setting to teach about the different kinds of dogs, assistance, balance,mobility, and seeing eye and to teach about tolerance."
5,Fast paced and full of life!,"Blair Wing has done an outstandng job with her debut solo novel. The characters are vivid, the plot is sound, and her dialogue is crisp. House of Cards will pull you in and shake you all about. A great way to begin a writing career!"
4,"An engaging flirtation, cover to cover","I enjoyed this book very much. I thought it was fabulous. Ms. Rothman kept the suspense high and I loved the heroine, Lady Barbara Worth. I did not want this one to end and envy those who get to read it the first time."
2,"good story, poor writing","Sometimes I wish I never learned how to write romance, because it made me extra picky. But I think that even if I had read this back in the day, it still would have confused me.I liked the characters. The dialogue was good, too. But unfortunately, I had trouble keeping up with all the crazy head hopping that was taking place. We jump from each character's head to the other constantly, and sprinkled within were many little flash backs or allusions to things that happened in the past. (or very, very long explanations of things)I also didn't like how our hero's mistress seemed so nice and fond of him, that I felt sorry for her, knowing that by the end it wouldn't be she who would end up with the man.For an example of an excellently written regency, check out Jenna Jones, Elizabeth Fairchild, or Julia Quinn."
2,Very basic chakra information,"Christel Nani has interesting, almost confrontational energy which gets her points across directly. The information is very basic, good for someone just beginning their study of energy anatomy. The quality of the recording is spotty and it was clearly recorded at a live event so some of the comments to audience members leave the listener wondering..."
3,"Good, but not a guided meditation!!!","I was expecting a guided meditation, so I was dissapointed.It is a lecture format, andit is vvery good, but I really wanted a good guided meditaion on Healing the first three chakras.I tried to revise my review, but cant figure out how to revise the stars."
4,The book was exactly as promised - I'm very pleased.,"I ordered this book, with 2 others by the same author, as a Christmas gift for a daughter. This order was filled in a timely fashion, I'm happy and so is my daughter."
4,A thing of beauty... for those who can use it.,"The MacBook Air is an amazing piece of technology to be sure. It can do most everything that it's big brothers, MacBook and MacBook Pro, can do. All in a thin, three pound package.But this machine is not for everybody. It's for someone who already has Mac tech somewhere else in their life and want a pricey, portable addition to that tech.If you're using this at home and the office, you'll need at least one Airport Extreme to get your WiFi going. You'll also need to have a sharable Mac, or an external hard drive or external SuperDrive. One of your WiFi devices should probably be the new Time Capsule so you can quickly back-up the system since 80gb probably won't last long these days.Apple usually stays a step or two ahead of the industry. This time, they may have taken a giant step too far."
2,Nice if you don't mind it being out-dated within 6 months !!!,I actually do not own this but my friend bought one a month ago. Very simply put; it is a nice toy if you have thousands of dollars to waste. In a very short time from now it will be seriously out-dated and Apple will push a fancier and more cost effective(cheaper)one. TERRIBLE VALUE
4,I love it,"I love this computer. It works, and that was about all I needed. I returned a Dell that made me miserable and I'm much happier. I think it is a little slow for watching movies, but other than that, no complaint."
4,A good handbook for Biomedical engineers,"This is truly a good book, for Biomedical engineers as well as graduate students. It covers much of the biomed's field with practical examples. This is a very good handbook to keep at hand..."
3,Neat Idea but....,"Even with added butter, the non-stick totally sucks.If 3 eggs is all the more you ever make, this will work."
1,ABSOLUTE DISASTER,"Seriously, this is the worst omelette pan i've ever used.If you are intending to use egg whites with this pan, forget it.A) It is not sealed completely so when you flip it, the egg whites I use come flying out the sides allover your stove.B) It is so small it's not even worth cooking in.C) EVERYTHING STICKS TO THIS PAN!!!!!!!! All you end up with is a big SLOP of crap everywhere and your stove is a COMPLETE disaster.This thing is 100% worthless.In the trash it goes."
3,Good but small,"I would give 4 stars if it waas just a bit bigger. As noted by another reviewer, the pan is small, suitable for about two eggs when adding other ingredients in small amounts. Overall, it is useful to have around and I am not sorry I bought it, but the T-Fal gets the most use.I woul I bought this item as well as a T-Fal 8 inch omelet pan. My wife and I both prefer the T-Fal for most uses. However there is a certain advantage in being able to close the pan and flip the omelet."
2,RIP-OFF DONT BUY.,"I bought it and it worked the first time I tried it butafter a few times the eggs were not coming out the way they were supposed to. It sticks to the pan and the eggs inflate and they burn. Also, I would not recommend to use more that 1 egg at a time because the center will be raw and the outside wil be burned. I bought it at $15 and even at that price I think it was a rip off."
2,Jole Nonstick omelet pan,"Before I purchased this item, I read all the reviews. No where is it stated that the pan is extremely small. When I first got it, I thought it was a toy. If you like good sized omelets, this is NOT for you. The pan is 3 1/4 inches across. As a result, I am going to purchase another pan in which I can make a NORMAL sized omelet."
1,"Great Omelette Pan, Built Cheaply !!!!","Makes great Omelette's but, I bought three, two have already broken after less than five uses. Sad !!"
1,food sticks,When I turn the food the oil leaks from the pan. Food sticks to the pan .Would like the pan to bigger.
4,No Problems Here - Quite Pleased,"It seems this product is one of those love it or hate it products with few in-between reviews. I'm in the love it camp.My omelette: two eggs, some chopped up pepper and onion and American Cheese.Coated the pan a bit on both sides with butter, poured the mixture in (minus the cheese) cooked for 2.5 minutes on one side (with egg face down), gently flipped it over (no problems with egg spilling out as others have complained about), opened it up stuck my piece of American Cheese on there and cooked it for about 2 minutes on the other side.Results were very good, egg cooked perfectly and no sticking at all. The only problem was my cheese got too runny so next time I will just add the cheese after it is done cooking.Minus one star because of all the bad stories you hear about non-stick coating being bad for you . . ."
3,Small!,I guess I should have read the specs closer. This is so small you'de be talking about 1/2 egg omelets.
2,Very small omelet pan,"I was shocked at how small the pan was. It seems well made, but I expected it to be larger."
2,Broke too quickly & NOT for omelettes,"As others have indicated, it's definitely NOT an omelette maker since it's (a) way too small and (b) eggs will stick to the bottom surface. Having said that, I found it to be a good way to cook up an egg evenly and slide it out with a spatula. But then the handle on the silly little thing broke after about three months, rendering it unusable. Oh well, back to the frying pan."
2,Bostang,The transaction itself was great. The pan itself worked great except for its size. The pan was very small. Barely can hold 2 eggs with all the goodies. Would have been please as punch if pan had been at least twice the size.
1,terrible purchase,"i bought this because i really love omelets, but they can be a pain to make. this thing makes them an even bigger pain. used it 4 times and gave it to the goodwill store down the street. what a waste of 21.00 !!!!!!!"
1,Terrible,I've used this four or five times and it disappointed me every time. It slops oil or egg on the oven when you flip it. It isn't as non-stick as it is made out to be. It's ruined every omelette I tried to make with it. It's not worth the money. My advice is to find another similar product or use a regular pan...
1,Omelette Pan,"This is a real disappointment. It was smaller than I pictured - definitely a one person meal. The handle is heavier than the pan, so it tips over before you can put in the ingredients. When you flip it over, it leaks. NOT worth the money."
1,Non-stick..?,"I don't know what this company means when it says this product is non-stick. I guess that they mean that it won't stick to your stove... I've found that a egg will certainly stick to the pan. When this happens, you end up with a ugly looking mess. Rubbing butter on the inside of the pan or spraying non-stick Pam, only causes the stuff to drip all over my stoves burners when it's flipped.It looks cute, but your really buying Chinese junk..."
4,Small Omelette Pan,"Great little pan for cooking omelettes. Takes about 2 tries before they come out perfect. Cooks evenly and is just the right size for a 3 egg omelette! Buy a different pan if you want a big omelette, this make good little single servings!"
1,Product was too small,"The service was excellent, but I was not satisfied with product. I thought that I was buying an adequate size omelette pan. The pan wasvery, very small."
2,Non-stick only lasts the first few times you use it,"As many reviewers have stated, the non-stick surface of this pan only works for the first 5-10 uses. This means that the chemicals being used on this cheap chinese junk are coming off onto your food each time! Good luck with cancer 8 years from now.I'd rather stick with flipping my own eggs if this is the best they can do."
4,Christmas gift for father,I bought this for my egg challenged dad lol He seems to spill eggs all over the stove top when attempting to flip his eggs in the morning so he was excited to receive this from me. I gave this 4 out of 5 because I had previously owned one of this exact models in the past and it worked well but after about 2 months use the 2 screws holding the handle on began to come lose every time I used it or even just washing it. The screws are tiny and a pain to screw back in every time so I tossed this and just improved my egg cooking skills to now I just flip my eggs=no mess.
4,Better than I expected!,"Okay, it IS small. About as big around as a good-sized sandwich roll. But for cooking for one, it's the perfect size. It's much better quality than i thought it would be. It's heavy and sturdy and the locking mechanism on the handle is great addition. I would recommend getting the jo!e lil flip spatula with it - it's just the right size and the handle is the perfect angle for use with this pan.[...]"
2,Does Jole Non-Stick Egg Pan Contain PTFE or PFOA?,Don't know if the nonstick cooking surface is free of petroleum which would mean that there is no harmful PTFE or PFOA present.The manufacturer does not say on the product label. Buy with CAUTION!
2,Cute is not enough.,"Yes, it's cute. I realized it was very small when I purchased it but thought it would be good for single serving omelettes. One egg seemed insufficient for the pan, but 2 eggs proved to be too much. What a mess. The locking mechanism worked fine but there was still egg ooze. Maybe if I hadn't dared to put a very little bit of cheese in. Mine didn't stick but I only used it once as it just wasn't worth the trouble. I've reverted to making omelettes the old fashioned way. For me, this pan was not money well spent."
4,Great Idea,"I am a single, so cooking for myself is a pain sometimes. This omelette maker is perfect for a quick breakfast and it is super easy to use. I have used it to make the egg filling for a homemade egg mcmuffin. Also, I'll add chopped ham, bell peppers, and onions and toss some salsa on top for a southwest breakfast. It takes ~5 minutes from start to finish to make breakfast.The only reason I'm not giving this item 5 starts is because there is a design flaw in the handle. The heat from the stove has melted the handle where it connects to the pan (because the pan is smaller than the stove burner). It left a burnt plastic smell in the kitchen the first couple of times I used it."
1,Incredible waste of time,Looking for meaning in midlife and forward to retirement? Don't waste your time with this book. The author follows a select group of elderly people in a small town. It reads like a boring interview of people you don't know or care about on a public access tv station. Or a grad student researching a thesis. I literally threw the book in the garbage.
2,Poor rolling,I bought 20 of these for my infusion center. This pole does not roll comfortably as the stand is too close to the floor. One almost needs to lift it to travel. Also the height adjusting mechanism is often difficult to release and tighten.
3,Not a bad book...,"I used this book to help prepare for the SAT II Biology test. I found most of it to be fairly helpful and well written; it included some good self-tests with plenty of questions.I found a mistake in one of the charts, it said the chemical symbol for potassium was 'P' instead of 'K'. Also, I found some of the graphs and illustrations to be somewhat confusing and some of the test questions seemed to include material not covered until a later chapter.Overall this book was adequate but I would not reccomend it for use by itself."
5,Quick Learn Biology,"This is a great supplement to any Biology course. There are lots of review questions and answers to help students prepare for tests or quizes. I bought this book to independently learn some biology terms and concepts--it worked perfectly. I feel so good about biology now and am not intimidated about talking about it with friends! If you are looking for a quick, effective, easy to understand biology book, BUY Biology the Easy Way!!!"
4,Good review,I purchased this book to review for the Praxis II Biology Content quiz. It did a very good job refreshing my memory on basic concepts I haven't studied in years. I'd absolutely recommend it to anyone who hasn't been through the basics in a while and needs a refresher. Good format and quizzes after each chapter help make sure the information is really sinking in.
4,good and a little too much information,"This is a pretty good review book for biology. But it contains a little too much information. I wish it concentrate more on the human body systems because that's what most of the test focus on. Anyway, this book helped me a lot. The end-of-the-chapter questions are good for test reviews. Even my Biology teacher recommend it!"
3,Better than others..,"There is a LOT of information in this book, some of which might be wrong. I didn't read the whole thing, this review book goes into MUCH more detail than other review books I checked out. Saying that it's ""Biology The Easy Way"" might be a misnomer - it's chock fulla information and just requires a lot of memorization. The diagrams were fairly clear, but there aren't many of them. This is overall a relatively good choice of review texts for biology, but if you think something might be incorrect, check it out somewhere else!!"
2,"This book really helps you to get an ""A"" in Biology","I have read this book and I think that it is really good. There are really good tests at the end of the chapter. There are connections to chemistry and anatomy in this book. The only bad thing is that the print of the bok is not very good, you can't read some of the writings in it."
2,there was no answer key,probably not the publishers fault but my book came without an answer key even though in the beginning it stated that there was one..
5,Best Cardigan Album,"I love how the Cardigans evolve on each album, but for the first time the lead singer is using a tremendous amount of different vocals. The style of music that they chose for this album rocks."
3,I miss the old Cardigans,"I love this band! They have the potential to be one of the most original pop/jazz/rock bands out there. They have that unique pop//rock/jazz/cuckoo clock sound (thanks to their keyboardist) that i absolutely love! Their albums Life and First Band on the Moon were perfect in every way. I couldn't get enough of the sweet and innocent sounding vocals accompanied by catchy little guitar riffs and jazzy keyboards. This is where the Cardigans truly defined their sound. This album, however, is a bit on the slow rock side and lacks those innocent vocals and jazzy keyboards. As much as I hate standard pop music, the Cardigans sound the best when they are extroverted and poppy. This album fails to deliver that. Don't get me wrong. This is a good album, it's just a different Cardigans from what you will hear from Life and First Band on the Moon."
5,Really enjoyed it,"Real nice and mellow album. Nina Persson has a very melodic and slow vibrato quality to her voice. There's a lot of musical talent in each song, and each song is a little different, but the album flows very well together."
2,Disappointing,"I have listened to and enjoyed the Cardigans since I spent a year in Finland in 98 when Gran Turismo came out and was overplayed like crazy. I was shocked at how good their 2004 album, Long Gone Before Daylight was. And I was equally surprised at how much this album sucked. The annoying thing is that I can't put my finger on why. It is just boring, not well developed and uninteresting. The one exception is the song Good Morning Joan which is excellent and probably belongs on the Long Gone Before Daylight album. I was so excited to buy this album because of how good Long Gone Before Daylight was, damn what a disappointment."
4,incredible album,"super extra gravity is the cardigans best work since gran turismo, which is just ridiculous. they've dropped the good (but pretty annoying) fluffy pop sound and have recorded an almost perfect rock and roll album. rock and roll albums are hard to come by nowadays. rock, yes, rock and roll, no. check out little black cloud, in the round, good morning joan (for a true schooling in song structure/writing), godspell, hell every song is just so good. i see people complaining about the obscenity of some of these songs. that's ridiculous. i'm sorry they offend your narrow view of what you find acceptable, but that's what good music does. offends. i have given this 4 stars because 5 stars are saved for truely perfect albums, but if there was a 4 3/4 stars, i would give it that."
3,How to Spell...,"As an American-Greek, someone needs to tell the author of this book that the English spelling of the Greek word for Grandmother is not ""YaYa"". Instead, the proper spelling, and one that I've seen most in my Greek upbringng, is ""YiaYia"". Now, everyone will pronouce this author's particular spelling of Grandmother the way one pronounces YaYa, as in ""The Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood."" Such is not the case with ""YiaYia""Please!!! someone let this author know!!!!!"
4,Informative book,As usual with Stephen Turnbull this is quite an informative book. I have always like the Osprey military books for their content and quality and this one is no exception. One thing I liked about the book is that Turnebull points out that some Ninja were of Samurai decent. Not a seperate caste in some cases. One important thing Turnbull does in this book is to dispell the mythology and superhuman aspects that surround Ninja that some people have been exposed to by watching movies or reading comic books or questionable magazine articles. As always there is great artwork in the book which is one of my favorite aspects of Osprey books. For anyone curious about the Ninja I would recommend this book. As with all Osprey books I feel the cover price is somewhat too high but even so is a worthy book in my opinion.
2,good for school kids,my favorite part of this book is when it states that the depiction of the ninja in black costume is sourced from a painting from the 1800's in japan (doesn't mention the same outfit. The illustrator goes all out with this holy wood garb featuring Chinese weapons & the mythical straight bladed sword with the square tsuba.It is not all bad & has some interesting facts sourced reliably & excellent witness accounts.
4,Ninja Ad,"most books from the Osprey Publishing to well to educate thoroughly on a matter in history, this one was no different."
1,Pistol grip,"It took a very long time to receive item , when I did get grip I used hair dryer to help install it to a glock 23 and it ripped ! I would not recommend"
4,"Thanks, Uncle Mike","I have one of these on another pistol, so when I got a Glock 22 I decided to get this one. It took a bit to get it on and in proper place because it does fit snugly, but once in place, it makes the grip of the gun unbelievably better."
2,"Good anecdotes, bad aproach to subject","Since the title sounds quite well, it's not a book to spend time. Although Metadata it's not a bad idea at all, today it's better spending our time on the Semantic Web aproach. For example, for a good introduction on that subject try ""A Semantic Web Primer"".If you persist on Metadata try reading ""Metadata Solutions"".Perhaps this book it's only an old fashioned view on a broad subject: information representation. Don't waste your time."
2,"some good, some CHEESY","it was recently made clear to me that Rai started sounding very happy cheesy sugary over-load with the awful cheap key-boards when in the mid to late 80s producers started catering to the taste of the French, and the music lost a lot of its original darker, forboding edge.the ratio of listenable/good tracks to the VERY cheesy/unlistenable ones on this collection is about 50:50, with nothing astoundingly excellent.most of the Rai multi-disc compilations out there are like this (sometimes a little better, sometimes a lot worse). most good Rai simply is not available in the US.the Rough Guide to Rai is actually a much, much better introduction to the genre, it includes some *amazing* lost classics and some quality modern urban electronic tracks (with Arabic and French rap)."
4,Absolute Rai,"A must for the listener that want to learn the sound of RAI. This 4 cd set is a broad compilation of contemporary Rai music. New works from Khaled and Cheb Mami gives a view of the current state of RAI, if not strictly in standard Rai fashion. Cheb Mami's contribution with K-Mel's ""Parisien du nord"" offers a bridge for the western listener, from hip hop to Rai. The album features Chebs Mami, Khaled (no longer going by the Cheb moniker), Bilal, Aissa, Fethi, Nasro, Hasni, Nabil, Zahouani, Abdelhak, Hassen, KhaledAziz, and Tati. The large number of various Rai singers give a glimse at the breath of current RAI trends. An added suprise appears midway through Cheb Khalas's ""Yalli Chef Ezzine"" in the form of samples from Flavor Flav."
4,Usual excellent read,"This author always provides the goods. Again, we have a thoroughly worthwhile read with the author's usual compelling characterisations and tight plotting. One minute flaw only - the plotting was a mite confusing. Nevertheless, installments in this series are always welcome additions to my bedside table."
2,Too liitle filling; very thin pillow,"I found these pillows far too thin for my taste. By comparison, I'm pretty happy with some other pillows I own that have 21 oz. of 550 fill power down (or 24 oz. for a queen size pillow). Also, as a warning, remember that if you buy these ""just to try them"" and use super saver shipping, Amazon will deduct the outbound shipping cost from your refund -- you won't get all of your money back."
3,"Soft and of great quality, but too thin for people who sleep on their sides","Great, but too thin for me!"
4,Hope they take a Second Edition version,It is simply magnificent!I hope that a second edition revision is madeThis HAS to be included in the second edition
2,Inferior to Music & Arts Recording,"I cannot understand how the previous reviewer would prefer this version by Archipel to the one by Music & Arts. In fact, it is the Archipel one that has the scratchy surface noise and poor balance, not the Music & Arts version which is smooth and excellent."
2,"Works - but mostly slow and doesn't ""seem' to work.","This cable fits the Zune, but the Zune doesn't seem to recognize it and so the charge status doesn't indicate on the Zune. It does seem to work if you leave it hooked up long enough - but it is a bit slow at charging. Cheap? Yes. So I'll live :)."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"i have a 16gb zune. the first time i used the charger it worked fine, but took forever to charge. the next time my zune froze. it took me awhile to figure out how to fix it. the final time i used it, thinking it should work fine, it froze and i couldn't fix it. i searched on the zune website for how to fix it and found nothing. the buttons wouldn't work, and it was broken for a couple days. in the end i left it on to try and run down the battery. once it was dead i hooked it up to the computer and was able to get it working again. the charger ended up in my garbage. my friend got the same one, she has an 8 gb, and it wouldn't do a thing. don't buy this, pay more for the actual zune charger."
2,Sharp UX355L,"Do yourself a favor and buy a different fax machine. I have had this machine less than 6 months and have had numerous ""paper jams"". When I called the technical support at the store where I purchased the fax machine I was told ""Sharp has had problems with this model with paper jams - it is actually cheaper to buy a new machine than to have it repaired"""
2,save your money!,I've had this model for a couple of years and it jams constantly. It has been reduced to being just my office phone sice I can't trust it to not eat my faxes. Buy something else- believe me!
2,buyer beware,"This fax works...at times. Sending faxes have been ok. But I've had a lot of paper handling issues when receiving. Like the first 2-3 inches of the fax not displaying because the paper was not feeding properly.However, the greatest knock on this product is IDENTITY THEFT. To print your fax on plain paper, the fax uses a black ink film. After you used up on film roll, you will discover a nice archive of all the faxes you have received viewable on the film roll. So, don't have any one send any sensitive information to you on this fax.And, shredding the film roll will gum up your shredder. ;-) Believe me, I'm talking from experience on this one as well."
3,Inexpensive but unnecessarily complicated,"Faxes should be long gone. They are the byproduct of a void that was filled by a technology that was far from optimal, but their timing was perfect. So, as a result, today we're left with a large legacy of these machines around the world: there's people who will not conduct business over e-mail, and still use ONLY phone and fax as their means to do so. Therefore, if you don't want to be unplugged from them, you need to have one of those.Having written this, I have to say this machine does do the trick, along with allowing you to set things up in triangular fashion, with an answering machine as part of the equation. Perhaps best of all, it supports plain-paper printing, which is a lot to say about these dinousaurs of technology. However, it is unnecessarily complicated to set up in my opinion, which makes it a pain to deal with at times. Inexpensive solution to your faxing needs, perhaps, but don't like it too much. I will give it only three stars."
4,"NIce, but...","Nice quality, but it is not noted that this item has a washed look. The burgundy fabric of the hat looks washed and faded. Additionally, I think they run small--very small. I purchased a large for my husband and it was tight on my head!"
1,"Would be a five star review, but....","It's an FSU hat. Being a Gator fan it pained me to purchase this hat. Alas, it was a gift for someone we love, so it had to be done. I can report the hat was very well constructed and was very appreciated (gag!). LOL! Hope this helps!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I have read many, many text books. From Contracts texts and Torts texts, cover to cover. Never have I had such burning feelings of rage towards a text book. It is poorly formatted, too wordy, has the most infuriating 'profiles' (dropped smack bang in the middle of a paragraph) and had little in the way of succinct statements of principals.Wildly angry at this text."
5,Great Reporting,"Thomas L. Friedman is the man for this job. His vast experience perfectly suits him for this special. It's an incredibly intense, controversial, and complicated topic and is explored perfectly by Friedman. Very insightful and informative. Must see."
1,Poor resistance band,I bought this machine when it first came out. The resistance band split in half after 3 months using it. So I bought a replacement and it was broken again after a couple of months. What a waste of money.
2,Goodwill purchase goes to work,"I got this at a Goodwill, brand new and in the box, for 8 bucks. When I got home I found out why the guy donated it. The bands would not hang on, and a design flaw kept slipping them off. A piece of wire repaired it, and I've been using it for a month now; It works, I guess. My buns feel rolled! But (if you'll excuse the pun!) I wonder if I should have saved up for an atlas ball, instead."
2,2stars for language,"I liked it, but a kids book shouldn't have any of those words in it. MAYBE one, but not, like, 10. I asked my mom what one meant, and she got kinda upset about it. A kids book shouldn't have those kinds of words in it. It was also kinda boring."
2,Where in the world is Sahara????,This book was good until the middle when the teacher took over the book. I kept wondering where in the world was Sahara.
5,the best book in the world!!!,Sahara special is one of the best books I have read. I loved it all like when the crazy teacher came that was so funny. Sahara kind of reminds me of the way I was [young] I would never do my homework and usually I wrote down things that I liked. The book also reminds me of my [school]teacher because when Sahara's new teacher comes to the book it just reminded me of her. So if you are trying to figuer out if you want to read this book you might just want to.
3,"Simple, but enjoyable","I was thrilled to see this book on the Caudill nominees list. I read Educating Esme when it came out, and even went to a signing and got it autographed! This book was useful for me as a teacher to have just finished reading two days before beginning a new school year. It's a pretty thinly disguised lesson to us all about reaching out to troubled kids and looking beneath the surface to figure out what's going on. I was thinking it's sort of like a Y-rated version of the movie Dangerous Minds. But in any case, it was a quick read full of cute stories that got me to reconsider how I deal with ""difficult"" kids in my own classroom."
3,A warning from a teacher,"While this book is well written and has a good message, it also uses foul language. Before buying this book for a 10 year old (or recommending it), parents and teachers need to know that kids may pick up some words that are inappropriate. Other than that, this book is well written and a good read."
4,really interesting,"I like this book, makes a good read aloud if you watch the language in it. My students enjoyed this book"
5,Read Sahara,"I loved Sahara and her magical teacher, Ms. Pointy. Teachers, read this gem out loud to your classes. We have Joey Pigza as a ""special"" boy and now it's time for a ""special"" girl, Sahara.Codell's writing will touch your heart."
3,Sahara isnt so special,"What a great book!Sahara is a ""Special needs"" girl well some people think that.The setting takes place in the fifth grade because ever since her mom (Ms.jones) took her out of the ""Special Needs"" program,which has made her fail the fifth grade;and repeat it againMy all time character is Luz for her accent ""esteekers""[example].But back to Sahara.She has a new class, but more important a new teacher Miss.Pointy.Her, with her copper colored hair in sparlkley dragonfly barrettes ,her pale skin, eggplant purple lipstick, lime green eyeshawdow,and heavy black liquid eyeliner.In this story sahara needs to survive without ""special"" treatment.Miss Pointy trys to help her with all stckers, journals Oh and that BIG basket of troubles.Sahara attemps writing,making friends, and tring to get her files!This is a wonderful story!"
3,Sahara Special,"Do you ever have a day were you feel like the dumbest person alive? Well Sahara sure did. In this book Sahara Special by Esme Raji Codell Sahara is faced with many problems that she has to work out.In this particular book the main character Sahara, loves to read and write. In the beginning of the story Sahara has to be in special education. Later in the story something amazing happens to her.I personally think this book is pretty good. I liked the part were Sahara took something and someone saw her do it. I also like the part were Sahara's teacher Mrs. Pointy comes to her house! My favorite part is at the end of the book though and that's were she finally get some friends but you will have to read the book and find out who they are. I think everyone will like this book Sahara Special by Esme Raji Codell so be sure to pick it up and read it!"
3,Sahara Spceail is a fun and cool book,"Hey have you ever read a book that you did not like? Well here is a book that you might like Sahara Special by: Esme Raji Codell Sahara Special is a book that 3rd-5th grade will like to read!Some of the characters are Sahara, Rachel and Miss. Pointy.Sahara is a 10 year old girl who doesn't know what to write in the black book, Rachel is a quiet and shy 9 year old girl who is friends with Sahara, Miss. Pointy is Sahara's and Rachel's teacher along with the other kids. Miss. Pointy is a funny but hard teacher!I think some people like elementary kids or even adults might like this book!I personally don't like Sahara Special because it has bad parts, good parts, andvery good parts but I can't really get in to the book Sahara Special so I hope if you are elementary kids you are willing to read Sahara Special!"
4,The review of an awesome book!!!,"You need to read this book! It's about a girl who's just been pulled out of Special Ed, now facing the challenges of a regular classroom. Her new teacher, Miss Pointy, is very different teaching strange subjects and giving special advice. This novel can show you what it's like to be in Sahara's shoes. It really brings out the crazy and touching parts of life. Reading this book was a great experience!It's a quick, easy read you probably won't struggle with."
3,good dvd BUT she talks WAY TOO MUCH,"I just thought that she really talks way too much....one cannot possibly be fast-forwarding each time you do the dvd. Suggestion that perhaps separate the ""teaching/talking"" into a separate segment. The set comes in 2 dvds, one a long form and the other the short form....even in the short form she talks way too much. I would have not bought the dvd if I knew how tedious it is to watch/follow."
2,identical practice/asana flow as in session one DVD set,"don't believe the hype. the content is exactly the same as the first session except for on this one, seane does narrate through the vinyasa flow. her voice is as strident and abrasive as ever. they also have what's called the ""breath"" session which really means NO NARRATION: you're ON YOUR OWN completely. if after a few dozen times doing the vinyasa with seane you should know it by heart, but then why watch/listen (really) to the DVD music?seane is an excellent technician and she knows alignment and breath - that is indisputable, but as far as DVDs go, i'm not impressed. i think gaiam is starting to believe its own hype."
5,Excellent Yoga DVD,"I love this video. The practice is precise and puts you in the moment with her detailed instruction. I do not mind the constant talking as others have mentioned, as it guides me and encourages me. It takes you out of the mindset of the practice just being physical. Am I going to be strong, more flexible? Actually with the slower pace and precise instruction, not to mention correct form, (I realize that I was doing the poses incorrect) it builds muscle because as she is explaining the poses you are holding them. You can feel Seans passion come through where it is contagious. It addresses mind/body and spirit. I will practice this for months and years to come."
4,Excellent tips for alignment,"There are a few irritating things about this dvd. Seane Corn's voice is a bit abrasive, and she races through some of the poses too fast to keep the breath in sync.It's worth it, though, because Corn is the only dvd-based yoga instructor I know of who actually instructs. As another review noted, I didn't even know how sloppy my alignment was until I used this dvd. Her attention to alignment and technique is so thorough that it felt like I was doing some of the poses right for the first time.Also, it's nice to see a yogini who doesn't have some crazy moonbat new age name like Rainbeau. Ugh."
4,Spartacus Guide and Gayguide.net together make sense,"Spartacus is still the most extended Guide, and together with Gayguide.net a valuable recource."
1,terribly wrong in parts on Asia,"Many mistakes remain in the secions on Asia. Certainly, many venue's information has to be updated. Moreover, imagined bias is printed in the guide. For instance, the guide maintains that in Taiwan the soldiers might be executed because of the charge of homosexuality. It is wrong. Modern Taiwan never executes any gay person, in the military or not. Information in the book is very misleading. ALSO: the current version looks much less appealing than that several years ago. What happened to the publishing house???"
3,We are getting too accustomed to lesser quality products,"I checked out the 3 star review after receiving the wrenches. Then, I took a better look at what I had received.It is very obvious, almost every wrench on the kit I recieved has significant grinding marks all over. I doubt they would last a month in my basement without rusting.I have Craftsman tools for over 50 yrs, no rust, well made and never broke a one.I am returning these and going to Sears today.Few products made today are the quality they were twenty years ago.These are just not worth the savings to me.Good tools never cost, they always pay for themselves.If you can't afford a better set of wrenches, these would probaby do the job."
5,I bought for my husband,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he hasn't complained so I guess it is ok.
5,I WANT THE IRREDESCENT COLORS,WHERE ARE THE GREAT COLORS???? I bought these tooth brushes in Paris 6 years ago. I love the covers. I love the colors. WOW. I carry them with me in a special small bag in my car. I have given them as gifts. People love them. I am happy that they are now available on the net. THE SHAPE IS BEAUTIFUL.
3,Not very satifactory!,"I like most of the songs by Dan Peek when he was in America because they had a folk-rock style. In this album, I cannot find any song that can be compared with his America songs or even his earlier solo work. The songs in this album are less melodic. When Dan tried to rock in this album, I felt that the ultimate outcome is less satisfactory."
2,Instrument not secure,I have seen ProPac bass clarinet cases before and they never had this much room. My bass clarinet just sort of floats around in it. It fits fairly securely lengthwise but the rest of the body isn't in touch with anything accept one point on the backside. What padding do I need to buy to make it fit and not bounce around? Guess I'll use my old case until I figure it out. Disappointed. The rest of the features are great but it doesn't do the most important thing and protect the instrument.
1,Oops!,"I bought this book and later I bought ""Totally Guitar"" by Tony Bacon. Then I noticed the latter had incorporated all of this Illustrated Encyclopedia (of which Bacon is co-author) in his new book. So with Totally GuitarTotally Guitar: The Definitive Guideyou get two books for the price of one.If you're only looking for Guitar models, the Illustrated History is brilliant, but if you're looking for a lot more on the side for the same dollars, try Totally Guitar."
5,leather/suede cleaner review,"I purchased Aquila Leather and Suede cleaner for my couch. The couch is not smooth leather, it has a texture, but not really suede either. This product was a good solution. My golden retriever likes to use one end of the sectional as his personal space. His oil has accumulated on the couch. I've tried other leather cleaners and soaps. They would remove some of the darkened area, but only with a lot of work. Aquila is a quick squirt then you wipe with a paper towel or soft cloth. You do have to act quickly. If the area isn't wet, the oil doesn't come off. So, I spray, wipe, then spray, wipe again. You actually see the dirt on the cloth. After the area is dry, there is a definite difference and the oil spot is far less noticeable. I think I want to buy their conditioner to keep the leather soft. Wish my dog liked dog beds. . ."
5,A very useful cleaner!,"I was skeptical, but went ahead and purchased the product anyway. And I'm certainly glad I did! I've used this to clean the cushions on our sueded leather couch (which is very, very light beige) and it's worked wonders. All of the mild staining has disappeared and I'm left with a wonderful, clean couch! Yay! I will definitely purchase again. Wonderful!!"
4,Decent socket for light use.,"I wanted to replace the stamped metal lug wrench that came with my car. So I purchased a low-cost ratchet to go along with this socket. I only intend to use it for changing flats, and occasional removal of the wheels to switch between summer and winter tires.This socket is perfect for that use at its price point. I don't know if it's robust enough for everyday use by a mechanic, but then, that's not my intended use. I have used it several times and no problems, even when torquing lugs to 100 ft-lbs. Plus it fits the nuts much better than the crummy OEM lug wrench."
3,Very Small,"Overall, it's a beautiful little pendant. That being said, it is... little. Based off of the measurements, I had expected something a little more substantial. I will keep it as it is too late to return for something else."
2,Not recommended for those seeking a thorough grasp of Chemistry,"I purchased the book to help me ""brush-up"" on some basic principles. I found quite a few typos and inconsistencies in the answers to the problems. I just wish I had read these reviews before I purchased the book. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who really wants to understand chemistry. It's just for those who want a very brief overview of basic chemistry."
2,A waste of money.,"This book (as do many others) assumes that the reader already has a basic background in chemistry. I do not. I bought this book because I have to have Intro Chem as a pre-req for a grad program. I already have one Master's degree so I am not an ""idiot"", but I thought this guide would help. It has a few helpful facts, but those facts were already in my school textbook. I needed a book that presented the BASICS of chemistry in teeny, little, baby steps. This doesn't."
4,"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Chemistry, 2nd Edition","book as good as new, got in on time, and overall i was satisfied with the purchase and the delivery process"
4,Less of an idiot now,"I feel that I'm less of an idiot after reading ""The Complete Idiots Guide to Chemistry"". It covers what any ""Idiots Guide"" should...the basics. Hard to get subjects are explained pretty well.For me it was atomic energy levels.I never have had a book tell it to me like I was dumb and thats what I needed.I'm not taking chemistry or anything but I like to understand the world around me and this book helped."
4,Chemistry Made Easy,"I purchased this book to help with homework and I have found it to be very helpful. The book covers the basics of a high school chemistry course but unlike most textbooks or internet resources, it tries to break down and simplify chemistry to make it more manageable. For example, I was having a difficult time explaining Lewis Dot structures or even finding a good resource for understanding it on the web. The author did a very good job of simplifying the approach whereby the generation of these structures made sense. The periodic table that is included in the book is detachable and also helpful. I would have liked a few more problems and some additional pictures may have been helpful but it was an excellent resource especially when combined with a number of the fine websites and interactive periodic tables on the web. It certainly made my life easier helping with homework and recommend it."
2,Still an idiot,"I am a chemistry idiot and I bought this book specifically for practical advice on how to dilute solutions in the laboratory. I was disappointed. This book gives a five-sentence description of Normality (that includes the more-than-obvious joke) and does not provide any examples (such as the difference in calculating the normality of H2SO4 and HCl. Or, how would one calculate the Normality of a 10% H2SO4 solution?) Alas, I remain an idiot."
4,Needs better editing,"I haven't had any chemistry since high school and felt the need to bring myself up to date as painlessly as possible. Although I felt that the book was successful in helping me with this, I found too many errors in problem answers and examples. At first, I thought I was having difficulty understanding the concepts, but as I went further into the book, I began to trust myself more than what was written in the book if something didn't make sense. I also needed to buy a chemistry textbook to help me with some concepts because some explanations were vague."
2,Caution,"I purchased this book as an adjunct to the College textbook I was using. Most concepts are explained quite well, but a bit on the brief side. Also, there aren't enough problems with answers provided.Finally, the book has many typos and often the answers provided to problems are incorrect. This caused a major loss of time and a lack of confidence in the book. I wrote the author and he said, I didn't have enough time for editing the book and suggested that i return it and get my money back."
3,Complete Idiot's Guide to Chemistry,"It is just OK. Not quite as helpful as I had hoped. I am 52 yrs. old, returning to college to obtain my BSN. This book, unfortunately, does not share the same important ideas as the required text for class, and when it does, it is not much clearer than the text. So, I find myself not using it too much."
3,Great book,"I actually bought this book purely for the illustrations by Bernie Fuches, one of the best in the business. Unfortunatly it didn't have a large number of his works, and the quality overall wasn't his best, but there were a couple of images in there that made the purchase worthwhile.The stories look interesting and well written, but I haven't gotten around to them yet. So for the artwork, 3 stars, and maybe 4 for the writing quality."
3,Full Moon Horror,Decent series of the first three Puppet Master films by Full Moon stidios. About killing dolls. Barbara Crampton makes an appearance in the first film. Takes place in 1939 then goes to the present. Third film goes from 1941 to present. Not nad.
5,I love these puppets!,"My husband has known for a long time that I'm a horror fan, but really only of older horror films. These have been a long time favorite of mine, and I even have a Blade puppet that is to scale. He surprised me with this DVD at Christmas and I was ecstatic! The films transferred over nicely onto DVD and the soundtrack was balanced. It's been my experience in some cases that older films moved to DVD often have a muddy sounding soundtrack, not the case here. Get these movies and enjoy!"
5,CORELLE ULTRA SANGRIA SUGAR BOWL,"VERY NICE! WELL MADE AND A GOOD SIZE. WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THEM. I ORDERED 2! ONE FOR SPLENDA, ONE FOR SUGAR!!!"
1,"Lousy product, not supported by anyone I can find","I am trying to resolve my issue for this printer with the seller and this is not intended to be feedback for them. It is however a substantial warning for anyone who needs to print from a PDA. This is not the product you need...I promise. The manufacturer has discontinued this printer as well as a host of other products. They will sell you paper for this printer. However, you need to having a working product before bothering to buy the paper. In the handbook that came with the printer, they claim you will be able to find a driver online but you will not. Sipix lists no phone numbers, technical help, or any other help source to solve the problems. Do yourself a favor and find another solution. If you find one for a reasonable cost, let me know. I truly need answers."
4,Fun accessory,"The SiPix A6 is a nice little add-on for people who need prints in the field. One thing to remember is that for most Palms, you NEED some piece of software to print with. IRPrint is a good one, but there are others.The OEM paper is a bit costly, but you can sometimes find thermal register paper in rolls in about the same size at a well-stocked office supply store. I scored a good deal a few years ago but have not seen any like it since. (Doubly annoying as you really cannot store too much of this paper without it going grey.)"
1,Cannot Install on Windows Vista.,"If you have Windows Vista, then this printer is absolutely useless. The installation CD is only for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Macs. The technical support website listed all over the installation manual [...]) is a dead link. There is no way to install this and no one at the company who will be of any help. Waste of money."
1,Good Luck trying to get it to work.,"The company that made the product is now defunct. I was never able to get my printer to work. It came with a cable that did not work. I bought an IR device that never made a connection and then after contacting the seller, I bought the cable they said to buy. It still does not work."
1,Do NOT ORDER THIS,"I have ordered hundreds of items thru Amazon and never been disappointed. However, this ""printer"" is a hunk of junk. It is out of date and will NOT work with modern computers> IF you are running Windows 7, there is no software for this. Also, if you computer in less than 3 years old, you will not even be able to connect it. DO NOT order the 14 dollar accessory cord (since the one that is suppliedwill not work with your computer) as you will then find that the software is not adequate. This is junk."
3,Ok,Battery doesn't last that much.Not much information can be found on internet. For making it work with IR I had to change the properties using the Printer control panel and choose the IR port.Definitely is a good printer and easy to use. You can print whatever document you want from your computer.
1,Not what it's cracked up to be,"This product was a disappointment. It won't work with my Palm TX, so buying it was a waste."
5,This book opened my eyes.,I read this book when it was first published and it still remains the best CODA/ACA type book I've ever read. Bob's writing is easy to understand and identify with. I've given it away to my friends and am ordering a new copy.
3,A good story,"Well, I find this book interesting and that is about it. It does not really help me in any way because it does not give any clue as how to do that. It is simply not deep enough and leaves to many unanswered questions. It is a good start for newcomers to recovery though."
2,Terrible sound and recording,"If you thought the recording on Opera D'oro with Callas was bad, wait till you hear this one. For the benefit of anyone who chanced upon this page, the recording is not just marred by lousy acoustics (probably understandable from the 1950s) and also irritating extra-musical elements of riotous applause and throat reverberations that has nothing to do with the music. Avoid this Vestale at all costs - it did not convince me as Spontini's masterpiece largely in lieu of the dismal sound quality, appallingly poor orchestral playing (although Leyla Gencer sounded magnificent) and not so much of the lackthereof in its intrinsic music value. Go for the Opera D'oro instead!"
4,Good Basic Book,"The book provides good information on the basics of wildlife care. If you've worked with wildlife before, however, a lot of it is review. That being said, its a good reference and great easy to read book for those who are new to the field"
1,what a disaster,"Wow! Super disappointed with this bag. Bought as a gift thinking it would be a cute bag to carry for the summer and to my horror it was a disaster. So much smaller than the measurements, more for a toy Barbie doll than an adult. I've several things from the so called ""world wide fare"" and have always been miffed and disappointed. No more....never again!!!!!"
2,A Fictional Account of Titus,"Although I have seen ""Titus of Rome"" listed as a biography of Titus it is an historical novel. The author uses dialogue between the characters and invents some improbably scenes: Nero poisons Titus' dog out of spite, Titus meets Saints Peter and Paul in Rome )of course, he's sympathetic) and has a romantic trist with Queen Berenice on Capri, where he has gone for a rest.Domitian is portrayed as a spoiled brat, then a senseless monster. The book has little historical value and is sometimes written like a romance story. Almost all of the information included about the ""good Titus"" and ""bad Domitian"" was been proven false a long time ago. Titus comes off as a golden boy who is unlucky in love but goes down in history as the best of emperors. This is a book to be read as a sentimental view of history."
3,Unique coming of age story...,"A Northern Light is a unique coming of age story. It combines the mystery of the murder of Grace Brown and the trials Mattie must face to reach her ultimate goal. The language was rich and colourful and you can't help but develop a certain admiration for the characters.The reason that I only gave this book three stars is because many times I found it dull and towards the end I only really wanted to finish it, because I was itching to start a new book, and I felt a little bad just leaving Mattie on the book shelf without knowing what had happened to her. This book is intended for a younger audience...probably ages 13 to 16. This is a wonderful book to give to your teenager, but don't think that anyone older than that is going to find this book incredibly interesting. Unfortunately, the murder story is only a tiny little part of this book, and not the basis of the story like the back cover might lead you to believe."
4,She Knows it All,"Mattie Gokey has her own word for everything.She gathers words, stores them up as a way of fending off the difficult truths that her life holds.While dealing with the fresh pain of her mother's death, she is being burdened with raising her sisters, while her father struggles with his broke back farm.The mad feeling she has for handsome yet dull Royal Loomis, who says he wants to marry her. And the secret dream of finishing high school and attending a college in New York to become a writer.I enjoyed this book because of the suspense and anticipation.I would recommend this book to any girl out there that enjoys old time books and stories."
5,Gripping,"Tragedy, love, loss, romance, friendship, humor, and a well-researched historical setting that gives enough detail to make it come alive without shoving facts in the reader's face--what more could a reader ask? There's more: a resourceful but fallible heroine, a murder mystery, secondary characters who are individuals in their own right, well-crafted language.Mattie tries her best but sometimes blunders. She is so starved for love, for the feeling of being special to someone, that when the dull (but basically good-hearted) Royal Loomis pays attention to her, it's no wonder that she loses her head. She has had to bear the burden of her family and her losses for too long, and when a good-looking boy who genuinely helps her seems interested in her, she can't be blamed for overlooking his failings.The reader on the CD hit just the right notes. I listen to a lot of recorded books and this is the best match between text and reader that I have heard in a long time."
5,Excellent Teen Novel,"This novel is probably one of the best coming-of-age novels I've ever read. It details accurately the life back in the twenteeith century, as well as giving two stories at the same time. This book is recommended to everyone out there; I know you're going to love it because I did. Excellent teen debut novel from an excellent author."
3,Ultimately Worth Reading,"The pace was slightly slow at the beginning, but it definitely gained momentum. I thought the main character was well-drawn -- unfortunately, some of the other characters felt like types. I think it would be a good book for classrooms, but not for reluctant readers."
2,a northern light,"this seems to be aimed at a younger reader. not as good as her other books, winter rose and tea rose"
2,a word of concern,"Northern Lights is an appealing story with good local color of upstate New York in the early twentieth century, but the story is spoiled with a few sexual descriptions inserted I suppose to sound more ""modern"" for this generation. I've decided after reading the book not to give it to my teenager for Christmas. Young men grabbing breasts, and old men's erections, and hairy behinds are not what I want to encourage my daughter to read. I'll have her stick to the classics and forget ALA recommendations from now on."
2,Not for me,I love her two books the Tea Rose and sequel but this book just wasn't for me. I prefer the movie verson on the subject that stars Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift.
4,powerful historical fiction,"Mattie Gokey has dreams bigger than her 1906, Big Moose Lake world. Desperate for money to help fund her dream, she takes a job at the Glenmore hotel. When Grace Brown, a guest at the hotel, first asks Mattie to burn a bundle of letters, it seems an innocuous request. But when Grace disappears and her body is discovered at the bottom of the lake, Mattie realizes that she must use the letters to find out what really happened to the young woman, while also finding out what she wants out of life. This book is a gripping story that entwines Mattie's dreams with those of Grace Brown."
4,Young adult for older adults,"I read this twice in two years. It was even better the second time. Realistic characters and a beautiful setting. It is a young adult novel, but I enjoyed it thoroughly and I'm a tad older than 15!Reviewed by Holly Weiss, author of Crestmont"
3,"A Nothern Light, somewhat dim, but close to being 100 watts","I believed that A Northern Light was a finely written novel, and the historical aspect of it was highly intriguing. I disagree with a review written as a ""kid's review"" by someone saying it was impossible to have been based on a true story. Ithought the aouthor did a fairly nice job with intertwining the properly researched murder of Grace Brown into the story of fictitious Mattie Gokey. However, more development on Grace Brown would be a plus. I also thought that time gaps in the story, were uneccessary. The story would have been better written, in my opinion, if they were in chronological order so as not to be confusing. The author may have bettered the story with a little bit more on the life of Mattie's mother as well as a more constructed ending. The ending felt rushed. Thats all, I hope this was helpful!"
2,Thematic warning,"I love historical fiction, so I expected I would love this book. It sounds a little like Anne of Green Gables crossed with a real-life murder mystery. What's not to like?The book is very well written. I loved the word duels. But I didn't like the book overall, because I strongly disagree with the theme. It is dark, darker than I would have wanted to read as a young adult. The theme is that marriage and motherhood are soul-killing. This theme is supported by graphic depictions of a difficult birth, a horrible depiction of breastfeeding and postpartum depression, and a dearth of decent gentlemen. Mothers who are happy in motherhood should be forewarned before passing this book to their daughters."
2,"Ok but prefer the ""Roses"" ....","I discovered Jennifer Connelly's incredible writing talent with ""The Tea Rose"" and ""The Winter Rose;"" both novels have become favorites of mine which I always recommend to friends/family. When I saw this book, I had to get it, without reading what it was about, nor realizing it was written for a younger audience. Therefore, I was unprepared for the writing style which was so different from the ""Rose"" books, and did find it more gearer to a younger audience than my other two favorites of hers. I'm not saying it wasn't meant for adults as well, just that it didn't compare on a literary level to the two ""Rose"" novels. That being said, the book was indeed interesting and I recommend it, with the caveat not to compare it to the ""Rose"" novels."
3,Good read even if predicatable,A Gathering Light by Jennifer Donnelly was given to me by a friend who finished reading it on her visit into town and didn't feel like lugging it back home in her luggage. It was not something I might have picked up in a bookstore on my own but I still enjoyed it. It was set up in the Northern United States in the 1920's and follows the story of a young girl coming into adulthood. It is mostly a first person narrative and describes this young girl's experiences as she decides which direction her life should go and whether or not she has the strength to make the decision. The author researched the era and the region so the story I assume is relatively historically accurate which makes it that much more interesting. A girlie-read with a somewhat predictable outcome but with interesting plot twists along the way with several sub plots thrown in.
4,Lovely,"This was a lovely book. I enjoyed it and was held in suspense throughout, wondering how the tale of the murder would play out and what the protagonist would do... I would have given it five stars, but there were a few places in the book I thought dragged or I didn't care for the image it gave in my mind. I would definitely recommend it as a whole though! Very artistically written. I especially love how the author weaves in the word of the day... very nice!"
4,Growing up in the north,"A Northern Light is a story of a girl who has a dream. 16-year-old Mattie wants to become a writer, but she made a promise to her late mother. She promised she would watch her sisters and help her father on the farm. Though she has a full scholorship, and a plan to work at a local hotel with her friend Weaver, she does not want to break her promise she made to her mother, and she doesn't want to leave her new beau Royal either. What will she do?"
4,"Long and boring, but it gets better","So I read this book, and I felt like quiting halfway through. It was too specific in detail, and nothing much was happening. But if you keep reading, it turns out that this book was very unique in its own way. It was really good. The ending was extravagent, and I reccommend this book to everyone."
4,powerful but confusing,"i thought this book was one of the most powerful feminist stories i've ever read, but the tie in with the grace brown story got very confusing. it was hard to figure out the time sequence because the story kept jumping back and forth from the glenmore to the gokey farm. it was very moving and i liked it a lot but i think the grace brown aspect was not developed enough to really give a reason for its use in the story."
3,"""A Northern Light""","I found myself disapointed with the characters, setting and especially the murder mystery.Throughout the book, we deal with Mattie and her problems. The murder mystery being only a subtopic among them. I was expecting a book like ""The Tea Rose"", full of real characters that jump off the page and take your breath away, a book where putting the bookmark among the pages is almost as painful as the suffering and triumphs of the character. Sadly, ""The Northern Light"" was a book I found myself relieved to have finished.The only good characters in the book where Weaver and his mother, and Mattie's teacher. Both who have more intense, dramatic stories then Mattie. Mattie was a heroine who I did not enjoy reading about, she fell flat to me.I recommend ""The Tea Rose"" also by Jennifer Donnelly over this book, simply because I found ""The Tea Rose"" to be more emotionally compelling and interesting, two things ""The Northern Light"" is not."
3,I had to see what happened in the end!,"It's not easy to look after your younger siblings, cook, clean, keep your job, educate yourself, make engagement plans and keep secret letters from being read. This was the life of 16 year old Mattie Gokey. She decided to leave her tremendous responsibilities and go to work at a hotel. But when a hotel guest gives her secret letters to burn, and if found drowned in Big Moose Lake, Mattie discovers the truth about a murder.This story about Mattie Gokey is intriguing and suspenceful. The reader will find interesting, depressing, warming stories in a typical teenage girl's life in the year 1906. Jennifer Donnelly wrote a winner."
4,YA Historical Fiction Worth Reading,"A beautifully written YA book that deals tangentially with the murder that was the subject of Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy, A Northern Light is a wonderful example of what a YA novel can and should be. Not only is it wonderful introduction to historical fiction, but it also offers a smart heroine who transcends the cookie-cutter heroines of so many YA books. Get this in the hands of your young adult and elevate their reading."
4,A really good Book,"This book is about a 16 year old girl named Mattie. Her mother has died and she has to take care of her sisters and father. It has romance, adventure, and mystery. The time period is 1906. She gets engaged to a boy who is named Royal. She has to go work at place called the Glenmore as a wateress. It is set around a murder that happeded and she is trying to solve the mystery.I really enjoyed this book. I like mystery and the time period was perfect."
4,Great Nancy Drew Games,All of these games are great.They are very fun and challenging.You never want to stop playing for a second.Some of the best games ever thought up and invented.You are always anxious for another one to come out.Buy any of them and it will be a good investment of your money.
4,Hearing protection - can't lose,"I've used all types of hearing protection from Ear Muffs to the Roll up Foam products. Orange is great - not easily misplaced and the string allows me to take them out but have them hang around my neck. The best part is that they work and are comfortable for many size ears. As is true of all protection that fits into the ear channel, it helps to pull back on the ear to open the channel. I keep some in my pickup (other people often forget to have something with them), a pair with chainsaw equipment, and also in my shop."
1,Not a good fit,"I'll admit I bought these to reduce non-industrial noises, which is not what they are intended for. But the main problem I had is that they don't really fit in my ear because they are too long/slim (or maybe I'm supposed to force it all the way down my ear canal). In order to have them fit snugly yet comfortably I cut off the ends but they aren't that helpful at reducing noise. I find wax earplugs to be most comfortable and effective for my purposes."
4,Good book.,Lots of good ideas. Not a book for quick projects though. Will need to spend some time creating them.
1,Creative greeting cards (Reader's Digest),Too outdated. Not enough new techniques. I passed it on to someone else as soon as I looked at it.
5,Dependable,"No complaints about these AA batteries. Reasonably priced, good to have on hand. Good performance, long lasting. Not much more to say, they're batteries, afterall. But I would definitely buy Panasonic brand again."
4,"They're AAs, what more do you need to know?","Panasonic's batteries are punched with buzz-words, like ""digital power"" and what not. Actual battery benchmarking is hard to find for batteries. But, to be honest, I have never been able to tell the difference between battery brands. With so many batteries being used, how can one really judge the quality of a brand every battery is different?I did some research. The initial runs of these batteries occurred three years ago with some unfavorable results. Panasonic's current batch of digital power AA alkaline batteries appear to be markedly better. I used them in a variety of devices: my beard trimmer, several remotes, and a few flashlights. No failures have occurred so far.I can't give it a 5th star as I really have no way of telling you these are the best batteries of all time. But so far they are acceptable as any other name brands and work just as well, making them a worthwhile purchase."
4,Never enough batteries,"Batteries come and go...literally. So whats so great about these? Well nothing really. They have about the same life span as most any others when used for basic applications ie; remotes, flashlights, cordless phones. So why should you buy these over another brand? Why not? if they are on sale, I say sold!"
5,Work fine.,"These seem to work fine in my two TV remotes, wall clocks, and in my digital camera. I have typically used Energizer or Duracell in the clocks and remotes before but these seem just as good. As to the camera, my Sony rechargables are my first choice (already paid for!) but I'll probably still keep a couple of these in the camera bag as back up."
5,High-end batteries for a GREAT price!,These are premium batteries at an affordable price. They bring out the best performance in whatever device they are used in especially electronics. I am always on the go and I am glad to have the Panasonic digital battery to rely on with longer lasting performance than the traditional alkaline battery. Glad to see Amazon is now supplying these batteries! And at such a great price!
4,good batteries,"the only real way to compare batteries would be to place 2 different brand batteries in 2 same devices & see how long they last. i didn't do that. simply these are batteries & they work. my only other way is to compare on price & at about $1. a battery here on Amazon, they're not as cheap as 50 cents a battery when on sale at CVS. other than that, good batteries."
4,Reliable power source,"These alkaline batteries have been powering my digital camera, and since first installing them, I've taken about 70 photos. Panasonic products are usually reliable, which is the case here. They cost a bit more than others, especially off brands, but do seem to last longer. I'd buy these again for my camera."
5,Good buy...great power,"For a long time I've been skeptical of digital type long life batteries, but it truly does make a difference. For your high drain electronics like Wii remotes and digital cameras, these are great. They last much longer! Panasonic is selling a great product but at a lower price than Duracell or Energizer. Less high dollar advertising equals great products at a lower prices! It's the Holiday season, so stock up!"
5,Great batteries,"They seem to work really well in our Wii remotes. I don't any any scientific or unbiased means of testing that these actually last longer than any other batteries, but they seem to be lasting a bit longer than usual. I'm not sure if we're just playing a little less or they really are lasting longer, but it seems I usually have to replace batteries every couple of weeks and these have been in for three weeks now.."
5,Good Enough Batteries,"So far these are entirely fine batteries, doing what they need to do and lasting well, hence a 5-star review for them. I do admit to being tempted to knock that down to 4-stars for the use of ""Digital Power"" in the product description. There's nothing distinctly ""digital"" about these batteries, that's just marketing terminology going in to play. And, frankly, I got these batteries over any other kind just out of curiosity to see if the ""Digital Power"" bit had any real meaning. Still, batteries that do the job and work fine--no complaints. We'll see sometime off in the future if they they really have lasted longer than the batteries they replaced. So far, so good."
4,Digital Power,"Between batteries, many people have either flocked over to Energizer, or Duracell. Mainly, there have been other brands that have been heavily overlooked. Panasonic has had some electronics that have not been as strong as they could have made it. Panasonic has though made some really great batteries. Their digital alkaline batteries have been no exception. They actually work very well, and simply deliver nicely in many electronic devices from CD Players, to remote controls for the television, and smoke and fire alarms. They do work very well, and this is definitely a brand that has been heavily overlooked in no just price, but power as well. This is a great buy for anyone who needs a bit of backup power, without the expensive price to boot.Price: BPower: B 1/2-Overall: B"
5,"Sor far, these are awesome batteries!","In my opinion it's kind of hard to review batteries. I mean, you really need to put them in something that will get an awful lot of (constant)use to give an accurate review. We just bought a Wii and put them in the Motion Plus remotes. Let me tell you, between three people in our family, and the two remotes, they've been getting tons of testing! As far as I can tell, these are fabulous batteries and just might be our new battery choice!"
5,Best Batteries,"I have used all kinds of batteries. Panasonic's batteries last for years!!! All other the batteries they sell like alkaline, digital, phone, and camcorder/camera are equally long lasting and reliable. I have some that are going on 6 years! Won't ever get another kind!!!"
4,These work fine,"I'm not exactly sure what a ""digital"" battery is. Maybe it is a little different from a regular alkaline battery but I cannot really tell the difference. These are fine as alkaline batteries go."
4,didn't find them exceptional,"I wanted to be overwhelmed with these batteries, but I didn't find anything to make them much better than what I normally use. Sure they work well, but so far, I don't find anything to say about them other than just that. ""They work well."""
4,Panasonic Digital Power Batteries,"It's not really fair to do a review without testing the batteries, side by side under the same conditions to see which lasts longer and how much longer. But I don't have the time to do that and get a review out ASAP, so I will say that I have these batteries in various electronics, from flashlights to fire alarms and they are all working well. If they last even 25% longer than standard batteries, it will mean having to change batteries less often; or in the case of my fire alarm, be able to use them in something else after I change them out at the end of each year. Panasonic is a name I trust and I've had good service with products that I have had questions or problems with; so I'm going to trust that they are longer lasting; which means less batteries disposed of and more reliability. So I'd buy them again and recommend them. If I find that they don't live up to the advertising, I'll update my review."
4,Great Long Life Batteries,I used these batteries in a television remote that tends to eat batteries. They have a great lifespan - and seem to be worth the extra investment over cheaper batteries.
2,"They take the ""hard"" out of ""hardcore"".","When I initially heard this record, I immediately noticed something was missing from the music.. but I couldn't quite put my finger on what was wrong. After a few listens, I came to the conclusion that the production ruins the record. Their guitar sound isn't heavy, but they don't have a Minor Threat-esque abrasive buzzsaw sound either. The end result is really flat and unaffecting. This would have been better with a different producer."
2,Just buy the first one,"I gave this 2 stars as opposed to 1 based on the understanding that nothing could ever have lived up to the first album (which, in fact, is in my CD player right now). The songs here aren't bad, but they're weak. They're formula. If anybody else had put this out, it'd be worth 3 or even 4 stars, but this isn't H2O. These guys are capable of so much more. Signing to Epitaph was a mistake. They went right back on their own message and forgot their roots. I was so disappointed in this record that when i got it i traded it for a Judge CD that i already had on tape. Hope you guys do better next time, man."
1,Off the Mark,"The introduction to Keegan's book sets the tone and texture of what he is trying to accomplish. ""To answer a simple question: how useful is intelligence in war?"" Regrettably, he fails to answer his thesis. The book is tedious. For those that are advanced students of war, this book will be a huge disappointment. If you are a beginner or of an intermediate knowledge, then I also suggest that you do not buy this book, but rather spend the money on something that will address a singular focus. Keegan attempts to use a number of historical examples that span approximately 200 years of history yet fails to address and answer his thesis.I am glad that I bought this book from a half priced book dealer because it is not worth much more than the $7 I paid for it.Terry Tucker, US Army,SGM,Ret; Professor of Military History and Science, Univ of Maryland"
2,Unrelated.,the title for my review explains that the content inside this book does not match at all the expectations.
2,Superficial,"I struggled through this book. I have to be honest to say it's a disappointment, in relation to other books of John Keegan I have read.The casestudies carry on and on about certain historical manouevres and the effects of intelligence (or combat information) on these manouevres. The cases are primarily centered on the distribution of information, thus on communication. This is very vital, but what about collection, collation, et cetera? Communication can be intersepted, but what about the relevance (and timeliness) of the communicated information? What about the developments in analyses and evaluation, about organizing intelligence? Almost nothing.Iff you are interested in intelligence, there are better, more in-depth (and shorter) books available. For ""firsttimers"" I can recommend 'Spies and Spymasters' (old, still available?), a clear, concise and sometimes funny explanation of intelligence through the ages.Excuse my English writing."
2,Seems haphazard,Not Keegan's best effort. It felt like I was reading parts and pieces from other works that may or may not be turned into full books. Love his work but this is for completists only.
1,Misguided,"If the author of this book was not John Keegan this book may well have never been published. It's thesis is questionable, the cherry-picking of widely disparate battles to ""prove"" the thesis is itself open to debate (Midway was won due to ""chance"", British intelligence did not save Crete-true statements that can be refuted by multiple other battles, had the author been intellectually honest)John Keegan's downward spiral continues. The moral of the story appears to be that if you selectively pick your examples you can support anything, no matter how flawed the thesis or logic. This is a shame-the author was capable of much better then this. A really poor work."
2,"Great author, poorly formed topic","John Keegan's mastery of the material is obvious. However, he picked an amorphous topic: whether Military Intelligence ""helps"". Keegan uses historical vignettes through the ages to prove his point, that Military Intelligence is usually not decisive.However, the question seems poorly formed. Military Intelligence means different things in different epochs, and in different situations in the same timeframe. Also, the manner in which it may or may not be decisive is also situation specific. Worse, not all of Keegan's historical vignettes prove his point.The result is a book full of interesting tales, but lacking clear synthesis. This great historian's talent and our time are wasted on a poorly formed topic."
2,A disappointment,"I saw the author on Cspans booknotes and was enthralled by the discussion. I went out and bought the book immediately. I can't believe the writer of the book and the man on Booknotes was the same person. Without going into specifics as other reviewers have, let me just say that I found this book extremely tedious and repetitive. I thought I would never finish it. (I always finish books I start, I'm a type A personality that way!) I recommend a pass on this one"
3,keegan stuck on the 20th century,"first, there's nothing, no information about al qaeda. being a follower of keegan since 'the face of battle', I wonder how he authorised a cover like the book has.The main body of writing centers on the 'Enigma' code breaking without adding anything new. Everything old hat. I wonder how Sir John Keegan came to the conclusion that this book was necessary. The central idea, 'war is won by acting, intelligence is (are)ideas"" puts in front of us another question. In order to strike, we have to know where, as the new situation, the 21st century situation proclaims.Keegan, with much more past than future as a military historian."
2,BORING!,I'm sorry to say this is one boring book. It just seems to go on and on. I couldn't wait until it was done so I could move on to something that wouldn't put me to sleep every time I started to read it.
5,John Keegan is Magnificent!!!,This is one of the best written books I have read. It is rife with history and filled with facts. It is an enjoyable and friendly read. This belongs on my bookshelf forever! This is one of the best books I have read!
2,"Some Interesting Thoughts, Some Errors","John Keegan herein presents six case studies of the effect of intelligence on war, and makes the very good point that intelligence is unable to accomplish anything unless linked to sufficient, well-used force.This is all very good, but I have to caution potential buyers: I know enough to partially evaluate one chapter, number five on Crete and Enigma. In it, Keegan displays such complete misunderstanding of cryptography that literally nothing he says on the subject can be trusted (he thinks the Caesar cipher, the world's simplest substitution system, is a transposition!). This leaves me wondering if the information I can't evaluate is similarly wrong.Worth reading, but probably not worth buying new."
1,"""I still have some dots to connect,so it's sort of complicated.....""","If you like convoluted mysteries, rather than a typical Longarm ,fast-action Old West western;you might enjoy this episode.I don't ,and for that reason I found it a pute drag and,even though I stayed with it 'till the bitter end,I was tempted to quit several times. I have never quit an episode yet;and that was the only reason I finished it. Not only is it a mystery;but it is padded up with all sorts of descriptions of Indian culture,etc., that has little to do with any storyline;and simply inserted to fill the pages. There is almost no action and the characters are dull and not well developed.Don't look for a good action-packed scene in the whole story;'cause you'll not find one.If this is your first episode to read in this great series;all I can do is tell you it is in no way typical."
1,Nice idea but awful,It's impossible to remove the ice cubes from the tray. I have to let it sit out and melt for a good 20 minutes before I can drop the cubes in the holding bin and then there's so much water that all the cubes become one mass. It sucks.
4,pictures are beautiful but too small,It is rather unfortunate that such a wonderful book has too small pictures.In some pictures one can hardly see the fine details of the pictures which are described in the accompanying text.
5,THE BEST EVER,thisis the best live concert EVER Dolores shines on every song the boys do a great job as well A MUST BUY for all Cran fans
1,No live back of the stage or crew,We met two lads that travel with the band. There was no mention? Not like most DVDs. That's what we paid for. We saw the show.
5,CRANBERRIES rock!,"This is one of the best shows I have seen! Cranberries are definitely one of the best rock band. All Cranberries fans should watch this show. It's been 6 years (1994) since fans got the first chance to see the Cranberries live on VHS. I think this is their second official video release. The show includes all their best songs and the place (Palais De Bercy,Paris) is amazing, not to mention the crowd! It's a beautiful,beautiful concert! What more do you need Cran fans? Just get this and enjoy!"
5,Cranberries to the last song,"This is one concert that I have watched from the opening to the last song. Aside from the music, one should observe the way the band members look at each other. They enjoy what they do. I like the way Dolores observes her shadow while she dances. The song I like most is 'Just My Imagination'. The part where they showed a photo shoot is really interesting. It showed the band in a lighter side which reminds us of ordinary people being self conscious infront of a camera. Just make sure you still find time for your family because you might get glued to the screen."
3,disappointed,"As I bought this DVD, I thought it must be as much fun as Tae-Bo, but it is not. The instructor is a little boring leading through the exercise, and some sequence have hardly any kick boxing in it. The abdominal workout is quite good. The conditioning workout has great exercises but it is not kick boxing but more like army boot camp and football camp.It teaches good kick boxing technique so for people who like to learn the basics. But it is boring for just a fitness work- out DVD.10 minute segments make it easy to pick and choose your work-outs."
5,Fun,"I bought this work out for my overweight 12 year old son. We do this work out together. We have so much fun. Its short enough for him not to complain and it makes him feel powerful like a fighter, even if its only for 10 minutes. I hope this video will be a catalyst for him to one day love exercise. The other day he was so happy to show me his bicep muscle starting to show.Thanks to this dvd!!"
4,OK,It is a good cardio workout. The ten minute sections make it easy to tailor to your time needs. My heart rate was definately up.
5,Good workout,"I'm not wild about the instructor, but this is a fun and challenging workout.Lotd of variety to work all parts of your body."
5,love this dvd!,love the fact that it allows me to mix and match as many of its 5 in total 10-min segments as I want. It helps me fit in exercise even when I don't have much time.This has become my other favorite exercise dvd! (Billy Blank's original tae bo basics has been my favorite program for 10years now).thanks
3,No kickboxing,"I thought this would be a fun way to exercise, but when I got into it, there was basically no kickboxing. The basic training was kickboxing, but after that it was all just regular work out exercises. I was very disappointed. However, I did get a good workout while doing those other exercises."
4,Lots of variety and clear instructions,"I find her easy to follow and undestand, though I am not a beginner to kickboxing and remembering dance moves. I really like the ""personalized workout"" feature that lets you select invidivdual segments in whatever order you want. However, the menu has some funny colors and it's hard to see what it is that you are selecting.Some of the segments seem way too hard for me, and I think I even pulled a muscle attempting the ab workout - you should probably be more careful than I was :)I have other DVDs, but I consistently come back to this one because it feels the most effective and has the most variety. I also use the Prevention Fitness Systems: 3-2-1 Workout as well."
2,Boring Workout,"This workout is not without challenge. So, even though it starts out easy, some of the sections get your heart rate up and and you will work up a sweat. However, the fact that each segment begins with its own warmup makes it too disruptive to do as one complete workout. Also, Keli Roberts is by herself, there are no background exercisers, and she is just no fun at all. I found this workout incredibly boring.I recommend Amy Bento, Cathe Friedrich or Chalene Johnson for fun and challenging kickboxing workouts, but don't waste your time and money on this one."
4,my first venture into kickboxing,i really enjoyed this. the first workout gives you the basics and moves you will need. you proceed from there by choosing what body part you want to work on. even the upper body workout is easy but i suppose you can use heavier weights. i enjoyed this because it adds variety to a weekly routine. i felt it was also fun.
5,Awesome!!!!!,"Since I have limited time each day, this DVD offers me the right kind of workout for my time schedule. Keli is extremely inspirational to boot!! I like this style of workout...Amazon you are the greatest and you ALWAYS deliver just what I need when I need it--THANKS"
3,"Wished it included a more ""flowing"" routine","Personally, the 10 min sequence does not work for me as Im used to taking TKB at a gym. The long breaks in between makes one lose focus. I wished it was more like classes at the gym where there is a routine and not just movements here and there. Time went SLOW. I felt like moves were quite scattered and offered no unity. It could be more fun as TKB is usually with some beat and dance moves. Not a fan of this. This teacher, not motivating...actually, quite boring.Back to Rodney Yee's yoga, see more results with this."
4,good workout,"i love kickboxing and try to find dvds that i can do at home that incorporate the moves. there aren't that many good options out there. this is one of the good ones. the only problem i had that is of the five segments, two really didn't have anything to do with kickboxing. the bootcamp and the ab segments had little, if any, kickboxing moves in them. i realize that bootcamp is in the title but i thought it would be more kickboxing oriented. still with that, the other segments that do involve kickboxing are good and the two that don't are worth doing because they work. it wasnt exactly what i expected which is why i gave it four stars instead of five. it was a good workout and is easy to follow."
3,A bit too fast paced for beginners,"I tried this today for the first time and wow.. I was working up a sweat within the first 10 minute section. I am 19 years old, about 95 pounds and in relatively good shape. However, I did find myself a bit lost with some of the moves, she goes pretty quickly. and a lot of the abs section exercises were very difficult to perform. Great workout.. but I'll wait a couple of months before using it again, and stick to more cardio based 10 minute solution dvds.."
5,Looking to tone!,"This is the 1st kickboxing dvd for me and I LOVE it! I have so much more energy after doing just 20 minutes. The instructor is awesome. I have already recommended it to several people and even got my husband to try some moves with me (I really wanted to see if he could keep up:) He thought it was a good workout, also. Get it if you really want to challenge yourself and feel good about defense moves!"
4,Reuseable workouts,"This is an inexpensive way to start getting into shape. There are 5 workouts, each 10 minutes long that focus on different parts of the body. You can do 1 by itself, or combine them. Perfect for super busy people. 10 minutes is better than nothing, right?On the other hand, this is no PX90 workout. So, as you do this for awhile, you'll need to mix it up with other workouts to keep up the muscle confusion and continue to get more in shape (if that is your goal).The price is right and Keli's style is friendly and motivating.So, overall, I'd give this a decent rating."
2,Not a Challenge...,"After reading these reviews, I was anticipating a heart-pounding workout, I was very disappointed! The only section that got my heartrate up was ""Fat Burning Blast"". The abs section has some nice, unique moves. If you love Tae Bo (as I do), you will be disapponted. I was hoping for more kicking/punching combos - there was very few. I would not even call this a kickboxing workout, nor was it a typical ""bootcamp"" style workout that made me hit ""pause"" to catch my breath. I am 34 years old, a runner, and intermediate exerciser and I found this workout to be for beginner/moderate exercisers. No one else mentioned this in their review: she had a very proper Australian accent which didn't motivate me at all - I want someone who forces me to ""give me one more! push it out!"". I felt like sitting with a ""spot of tea"" afterwards, not running for a towel and water."
3,Great Toning Video,"I like Kelli Roberts because she knows her stuff. Her form is great and I never feel in danger of twisting my ankle when doing her routines. I am giving this video 3 stars because its title is misleading. There is a minimal amount of actual kick boxing. The toning sections are great and you will feel the burn, but you're not kick boxing. Its more boot camp style."
5,"Easy Instructions, Incredible Results","If there is one workout video you MUST have in your collection, this is it.Last summer I didn't have a gym membership. Instead, I faithfully did four of these 10 minute workout sessions a day. This video got me into the best shape of my life! I lost nearly 10 pounds and gained ""four pack"" abs.If you use this video regularly, you will see results FAST. This workout will give you incredible definition in your arms, legs (nothing has ever worked like this for my thigh area)and abs.Honestly, I'm not very good with choreography but these instructions are very simple and easy to follow.I give this video my HIGHEST recommendation."
4,Fantastic Instructor,"Keli Roberts is a no nonsense instructor who gets results. I have several of her other dvds and she's nothing short of great. This dvd only got four stars because it's not quite long enough to shed serious weight if you're someone who needs to do so, however she's motivating and the workouts that are here, while short, are energising and toning if you don't need so much work. I would only recommend this as an extra dvd for quick workouts, but otherwise concentrate on longer programmes."
5,Excellent Workout,This workout was excellent; I truly felt it working right away. The instructor was very good and it was very easy moves and the intensity was perfect. This is my favorite DVD and I would recommend this to anyone that is short on time.
5,Love It!!,"I got Kickbox Bootcamp a couple of months ago and have loved it from the get go! This work out pushes you to your limit, but makes you feel excellent. The first week I did this workout, I lost about 2.5 pounds. I can also tell my endurance is building because now I can do the Fat Burning Blast without a lot of huffing and puffing. I would strongly recommend this workout! I love it!"
4,Move Your Butt!,"Ok, these 10 min exercises are really good! They get my heart pumping everytime and they are not too difficult. 10 min and I feel like I did good for the day!I would recommend starting with the basic training option first, otherwise it is really hard to figure out what she is doing for later routines. She moves really fast. It takes me once or twice doing the video to be able to keep up with what she is doing well."
5,Great stuff,"I really like Keli Roberts - she comes off as intelligent and strong, and her focus is always on becoming stronger and improving your kicks and stuff, rather than on body image. Anyway - each of the workouts on here is challenging for me - I'm not even doing the bootcamp one yet as it was a bit much. The 'basic training' one is not terribly challenging, which is GOOD, because it makes it easy and brainless to throw in some straightforward cardio. I've seen really quick results adding this video into my weekly workouts with regard to gaining strength and increasing my abilities and fitness level. I totally recommend this."
2,Does not Keep,"I purchased this and really enjoyed the first box. However, a few weeks later when I went to cook another box there were bugs, like flour bugs, in the pasta and I had to throw it all away. The box states 100% money back guarantee, however the Hodgson Mill did not send me my money back they sent me coupons for their products; products I am not sure I want to buy in advance of using them. If you purchase more than what you can eat on the day it arrives I would advise storing it in more than just the box it comes in."
4,Good product,"I really like these because they are 100% whole wheat, have great fiber and cook up fine. My 2 year old loves them too. I buy shells and cheese from Costco (healthy version) and just put some of the cheese sause on them and that way I get more fiber in my diet."
5,Digging for Dinosaurs,"My son came home from Kindergarten the other day talking a mile a minute about this movie they watched because his art teacher was sick. He begged me to go online and find it, even though he was not sure of the name just a song in the movie. Turns out it was this older movie and we were thrilled to find it on Amazon Marketplace. Can't wait for it to arrive."
2,The Goulash History for the Casual Light Reader Brigade,"The author's writes well. However, he is not a second Professor A.J.P. Taylor. He seems not to be a scholar at all. He had collected varied and interesting information from sources which he quotes freely, if indifferently. This book may well be of interest to those who desire only something interesting to read, which leads them down many dissimilar roads with no particular destination in mind. The suppositions the author does make about some aspects of the Crimean War will find detractors among historians of merit who have studied this conflict in its historical context of Europe, Anatolia, and the Levant.It is interesting, but not very informative to serious students of history."
5,charm in small things,I have put away this whole collection for my daughter when she is older. I have to admit that my 8 year old son and I are just as charmed by them as I know my daughter will be.
3,OK If You're Still a Chrstian...,"But I couldn't make it past the first couple of chapters because the reasoning was almost totally from the Bible. Having been abused by people while listening to them quoting the Bible, that approach isn't helpful for me. I wish I'd known how christian/bible based it was prior to buying it. Something a little more psychology/sociology based would have been better for me. If you're interested in a real in-depth look at what the Bible says about SA then this is a good book for that. But, for those like me, run far from this book. It hurts more than it helps."
1,Bad Bad Bad One,"you buy a book and hope that teach you something ,but this is a step by step cook-book and will never teach you cook just make some foodJust for biginners , if you a looking for learn about electronics and the PIC programmer use a dedicated book"
5,One of a kind wristband!!! :D,I really like this wristband its great for running and weight lifting I really love it and recommend it to anyone!!! :D
5,Not the biggest or most absorbant but just right.,I bought these just to spice up the tennis outfit. First impressions are that they weren't the longest or as thick as some of the other brands i bought.Until i wore them. they get the job done and look the best while doing it.Now this may mean they wont last as long (month-wise) but in terms of fashion and price I think it's good. looks great.I wouldn't go a full two set match in anybody's wristband so you might as well stock up on these instead.I tell you perfect size and thickness for tennis outfit.
2,not absorbent,"I purchased head & wrist bands in the hope that they would compare to the Nike bands. There is no comparison. These bands fit tight, and I find myself pulling on them as I run. Also, they are not super absorbent. I think these would be best for show, to color up an outfit maybe. They are not for the serious athelete who is looking to soak up sweat."
1,Don't Be Fooled By The Photoshopped Picture,"I bought this set of wristbands because I was looking for one that was longer than the typical band. After searching through all the items on Amazon, this one had the best price of all the ""long"" wrist bands being offered. When they arrived, of course, it was just a standard wrist band (about 3 inches) instead of what's shown on the picture. The thickness was fine, and it would be an OK wrist band if I were looking for just a standard item. Coming back to Amazon, I now see that all the images have been photoshopped to make the wrist band look longer than it actually is. If you look closely, you can see the line where each item is made to look about 50% longer than reality - not even a very good photo manipulation once you look at it. Lesson learned - don't believe your eyes when shopping online (the description never claims to be a long wristband)!"
5,Very nice and affordable wrist bands,"I think these wrist bands from ATAFA are very nice and cheap. I bought several wrist bands a few days ago and they were received on time. More important, these bands have very good quality. Overall, I would like to rate them ""5 stars""."
3,took too long,"Delivery date was july 26 to july 31, didn`t get them till Aug 4.needed them aug 1 .thanks for prompt service......NOT"
3,wrist sweatband,It's made with better quality than I expected. I'm happy with what I got for the price
4,Absorbent,"I bought a bunch of these (I play tennis a lot in a hot weather). They are indeed very absorbent, I played over two sets and my hands were still dry. The funny thing is that they feel like they are not absorbent, it feels like they have a coating of something that you would think would not absorb water (you know like those cheap towels that will not dry you up?) Yet I don't know how it does it, but on my wrist and on my head from the inside, it absorbs all the sweat (maybe the outside is coated differently?). I have not washed them, which will be the real test, but you certainly can't beat the price."
4,Good for the price,"Great sweat band, I certainly sweat with it, but it wipes the excess nicely from my face when I'm working out. I just wash them and wear again. Simple."
5,GOGO Thick Solid Color Wristband,I received the GOGO wristbands within a week of ordering and they have good absorbancy. A good sweatband for an excellent price.
1,Don't waste your money,Strings starteed coming out on my first run. My face was dark with all the stuff that came out. My friend said I looked like a fireman that was just in fire...
2,basic as you can expect,"the bands are the smaller size, basic sweatbands, more useful for props than anything. they are cheap $ for a reason, but they should accomplish whatever you need them to do, except absorb sweat or fit over a watch. not viable for wrestling officials or competition, but they are viable for everything else."
5,Great little sweatband for the price,"I got several of these simple sweatbands and the matching thick wristband with zippered pouch for running. I don't like to run with gloves, but my wrists freeze! These do the trick, and I just throw them in the wash. They are great to keep your wrists warm, and if you are a runny nose runner like me, they do the trick for a nose wiper. They wash up super nice."
3,Pay for what you get...,I say 3.5 stars. It was inexpensive and arrived promptly... It's a basic white cotton sweatband...not much else to say.
5,Great for wrestling referees,I purchased this to use for reffing wrestling matches and they work perfectly. I would recommend getting these instead of the more expensive branded ones.
5,my viscera are eternally thankful !,"when it comes to indian holy men , its often hard to separate the dross from the sublime . books on indian mystics abound , most just end up stretching credulity . its not uncommon to come across a book which portrays some indian ""saint"" that leaves me shaking my head in an almost visceral disgust .it therefore comes as a relief ( especially to my viscera ) when you read a neatly written book about an indian saint . i'm sure its next to impossible to please everyone when it comes to writing about someone no less a phenomena than ramana maharishi , but messrs osborne seems to have done a commendable job of it . i know he's done just such a commendable job of it because the book left me wanting to know more about the maharishi . not many books do that .i can therefore , unreservedly , recommend this book ."
4,Very informaive,"Very informative and well written book.I learned alot and would not hesitate to read other books by this author.I had heard about Jane Goodalls studies but this went beyond just studying the chimps.She formed a personal attatchment to them, knew them by name and devoted her life to this research."
5,"Bravo, Jane!",Jane Goodall shines when writing about her passion.Her years spent patiently observing and respecting theseinteresting primates made for a great read.
5,Fascinating and moving!,"Jane Goodall has said that if the chimpanzees could select a patron saint for themselves, she would be selected!""Through a Window"" is the story of wild chimpanzees, and they become as incredibly vivid as characters in a biography. They can act so human like it'll make you gasp! Love and hate, fear, bravado, jealousy and murder and even cannibalism are all there. You empathize with poor Gilka when her babies are snatched and eaten by Passion, when old Flo succumbs to old age, her teeth gone, her ears in shreds, when the alpha male Mike is dethroned by the younger Figan, when Getty perches on his mother's back, grinning with juvenile high spirits.Goodall makes you think deeply about these creatures, whose DNA is 99% the same as ours. She writes with charm and uses vivid description. You follow the lives of the chimpanzees laid out before you in a fine biographical feast. You'll be hooked. You'll care. Highly recommended!"
5,Through a Window is truly fascinating.,"In Through a Window, Dr. Jane Goodall gives an educational yet entertaining look into the world of chimpanzees. I was utterly absorbed in the book by the first chapter. If you are even remotely interested in chimpanzees or their close relationship to humans, you will thoroughly enjoy this book. It gives wonderful scientific insights into the systems of the chimpanzee community. I recommend that everyone read this book."
5,Absorbing,"Jane Goodall has a writing style that flows beautifully. I was surprised by how quickly and completely she draws you into world of the chimps and how much the families were relatable. Ms. Goodall is inspirational in her years of compassionate service and work towards restoring environments, assisting communities and protecting endangered species around the world."
3,Lots of repetition,"Jane Goodall's work is legendary, so any negatives in this review should be taken with that as a premise. I bought this as an e-book on a one day Amazon special, so I didn't pay much for it. It's been very interesting; however, I've found that there are TONS of anecdotes, and many of them are very similar in describing chimps' behavior. I probably didn't do complete justice to the book because I read it in bits and pieces rather than in a couple of sittings. The reason this might be an important factor is I found myself forgetting just which chimp belonged to which family. Goodall names all of ""her"" chimps, and it can be formidable to keep them all straight. I don't have any particular interest in animal behavior; I was just trying to educate myself on the subject. While I'm glad to offer my opinions of the book, don't take mine as anything other than what it is: a very uneducated take on Goodall's book."
4,Good for being old,"This cd/dvd box set is enjoyable, the sound quality is not what I am use to when it come to today's remixes but with a few twekes on your equalizer, you can get it to sound better. So go out and buy it if you can find it."
1,Dont buy this DVD,Sound and Video are way out of sync making this impossible to watch. sounds like a 1960s era transistor radio sound quality. dont aggrivate yourself; pass this one up; I give it a -5
5,The Third Live Release From The Original Marshall Tucker Band Is Great,"CAROLINA DREAMS: TOUR 77, the third live album to feature the original lineup of the Marshall Tucker Band, is a great double-CD/single-DVD set drawn from the band's tour supporting the studio album CAROLINA DREAMS. On the DVD, which is the only one to feature the original band, you can actually see how brothers Toy (lead guitar) and Tommy (bass guitar) Caldwell feed off of each other to create terrific interplay that obviously influenced many latter-day ""jam bands."" This set is a must own for anyone who loves rock & roll in general and Southern rock in particular."
1,poor quality,the sound and video did not sync. Very poor product. I gave it as a Christmas gift and I know have it back.This was a new product that looks and sounds like a rip or Japanese monster mvie.[...]
1,Sound way out of synch w/video,"The sound quality and video quality are both OK on the DVD. Too bad they are at least 5 seconds out of synch, it makes the DVD impossible to enjoy. The CDs are OK too, but whoever produced this set needs to take a class or something. I'm going to turn off the DVD sound and play the CD while I watch, I'm sure I can time the sound closer to the video than this!"
2,NOT VERY GOOD QUALITY.......,"I'VE BEEN A HUGE FAN OF MTB FOR YEARS, HOWEVER I FOUND THIS DVD HARD TO WATCH. THE QUALITY OF THE VIDEO PORTION IS AVERAGE AT BEST.OUT OF FOCUS AND SHOT FROM THE SIDE OF THE STAGE ALOT OF THE TIME. IT IS A GOOD HISTORICAL RECORD OF THE BAND BUT I WOULDN'T EXPECT MUCH MORE. THE QUALITY OF THIS BOX SET SMELLS OF QUICK MONEY FOR THE ESTATES OF THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS. THE OTHER DVD OF THEM IS NOT AS LONG BUT IS A BETTER."
2,Carolina Dreams Tour '77,"Very poor video reproduction. Too dark, even grainy. Music pretty fair except for ""24 Hours at a Time"", which has no live footage, just a slide show. A much better DVD for my money is MTV's production ""Live from the Garden State"" recorded in New Jersey in 1980."
3,Great package with average sound quality.,"I agree with the previous review on the DVD. Not bad for a 30 year old tape ( I own plenty of Zappa & Dead DVD's in which splicing and mending of old tapes is part of the game). The surround sound does help a lot and you can't beat the original line-up.What I don't like is the double CD. Very poor sound quality, something I would expect from an unofficial bootleg. Most cd's in my car I play with the volume between 15 and 25. I have to turn the volume all the way up to 45 so I can play this loud like it should be played. There's a lot of hiss and background noise that take away from the experience.Overall not bad, and a must have for any MT fan since the DVD isn't sold seperately. If your looking for a live CD, then Stompin' Room Only would be a much better choice, even if it doesn't contain the original line-up. The DVD of the same title (sold seperately) is also a better quality DVD."
3,Buy it for nostalgia and enjoy.,If you are a long time Tucker fan I recommend buying this for nostalgia if nothing else. Seeing the original members play together is a treat for any fan even if the sound and video quality aren't the best.......and they're not. The cd is an entirely different matter. Shout factory should have left well enough alone. The sound quality on these cds is down right pathetic. Stick to Capricorn recordings if you want really listenable recordings of MTB music.
4,Bilingual Hardcore Punk,"Union 13 mix politics and guitars in a thrashing mess that recalls the original LA punk scene. Much has been made about their bilingualism. However it should be noted that the LA punk scene was always heavy with Chicanos. This is just a new chapter and a new decade. As the band says, ""Todo es politico!"""
5,a wonderful book!,"I just finsished this book and loved it! It is very informative, but also creative in it's format. I definatly recommend reading it if you are interested in mother/child/family relationships in various cultures in various points in history."
5,Fun Book!,"I am helping throw a baby shower for a friend and social studies teacher, and we decided a great theme would be ""Babies Around the World"" (especially with the new ""Babies"" movie in theaters). I wanted to come up with some ""gifts from mothers of different cultures"" to give at the shower. This book had lots of ideas for that purpose, and I had a lot of fun reading everything in the book. In addition, it has also made me look at my own 6-month-old daughter in a new light - babies of many cultures are treated so differently and they all can turn out to be productive human beings (so there is no reason to panic that I am not a perfect parent)!"
4,Driver's Mirror,This item worked perfect and shipped exactly as it was described. Came in great condition. Very pleased this worked on my 98 sunfire.
5,"Excellent Speakers, but have a question","I have these speakers, and I love them. The Base on these are Amazing. I have the X-fi music sound card and my sound never sound like this before in my life...hooking this up to my PC. Xbox and other devices are easy as 1 2 3. But i have one question that is hitting me. I saw a pic of this product...and the description they gave to it was.....""Here is the back of the Subwoofer and the Satellite. It's connected by a ""clip-on"" -- with DETACHABLE wires -- instead of RCA type. The cable on the bottom left picture -- on the subwoofer -- is from the SoundTouch Control Center.""Does it come like that now, or did they had some work done to it to work like that. But anyways....these speakers are great for any one who wants affordable excellend sounding speakers ..with 500 watts of power. That can hook up to 6 devices."
3,Broken item,"After spending much time with Logitech diagnosing why only 2 speakers worked, they deemed the unit to be defective. I've wanted these speakers for some time now because of all the reviews I've read saying these were fantastic speakers, but I cannot enjoy them since the seller sold me a defective unit. I don't blame Logitech on this, rather the seller."
4,Great speakers,"Great speakers for your computer, or entertainment system.I use it for both. Great bass, but center speaker could use a bit more power. Still excelent speakers for the price."
5,Candy for the ears!,"Always loved logitech, and never had a problem. My old speakers were logitech and have lasted me 6 years. I upgraded to the Z-5500 and it's like candy for the ears."
4,Good Speakers,The speakers are very good. They can get very loud but still provide great sound quality. The sub is huge and provides good bass. The only drawback is that the wires that come with the system are not that long. If you have a decent size room you will probably need to by longer wire. But that is easy cause it works with any standard speaker wire and the quality is just as good.
5,awesome product,"awesome product. the bass unit is much bigger and more powerful than I expected. I took my time and still had this up and running in less than 30 minutes. I bought this as a refurbished product, and there is no way to show it. looks and performs brand new !! Also shipping was in less time than expected."
3,"Speakers good, randomly shuts off","I bought these speakers a few months ago and had no trouble whatsoever. The sounds is great, and I like this set very much. However, the speaker will go into standby randomly, even if there is sounds running through any of the connections(optical, coax, direct). There is a forum [...]where many customers talk about this problem. So far I have no found out what the problem is exactly."
1,Logitech dosen't back there systems,Purchased my Logitech Z-5500 THX-Certified 5.1 Digital Surround Sound speaker System back in July of 2007 with my computer system. Sounded pretty good (bass isn't the best)but I could live with it. After two years I started to have problems with the pod and then the system stopped working. I went to the Logitech web site and they said the site was down. It finally started to work and I sent a e-mail to Logitech and told them what was going on and never got a response. I had a computer tech check them out and he couldn't figure it out. I will never buy anything from Logitech again. There is NO customer service.
3,Great Sound and Price,"I've had these speakers for over 5 years now and they still sound great. I'm giving them 3 stars for the following reason.1.) Subwoofer cannot be integrated into a higher end receiver if you want to upgrade your system2.) Surround speakers do not easily mount on stands such as Sanus. I had to actually take them apart to mount them.Other than those two tidbits, I love these speakers and will probably hold onto to them for a long time and put them in an extra mancave, gameroom or outside shop."
4,Using it as HTIB!,"Bought the Logitech Z-5500 speakers for $189 from Amazon last month...I'm using them as my HTIB...connected Dishnet DVR receiver with Digital Fiber Optic cable and Philips DVD player using Digital Coax cable. I had to buy a male female VGA to keep the Subwoofer at a distance from the control unit and my flat panel TV...works great. If you're buying these cables, then get them from Amazon...cost is much less than getting them in-store locally.Cons: Does not support HDMI; The VGA wire in control unit cannot be detached."
5,Awesome,"Awesome product, perfect for a home entertainment system without having to spend the big bucks!"
4,"Great sound, strong bass, ok build quality","Well, I can not complain about the volume, bass or mounting abilities of the system. I did have a surround speaker buzz and crackle after 5 months. That's the only reason I have not given this system a 5 star rating. I replaced the speaker with an ebay purchase and hope that will be the only replacement I have to worry about for a while."
4,speakers,These speakers are not bad at all so far and really easy to use. You don't have to fight with a receiver in order to get the speakers to work right .
5,Best PC Audio System I have Ever Owned!,"The sound quality is extremely clean and I have only used the stereo inputs. The bass hits really low too. It doesn't push as much air volume as you would think a 10"" sub would, but you definitely can hear and feel the bass around the house. It's sounds so good I might even buy a second system for my TV. For this price I do not think there is a better deal anywhere. This is the best electronics purchase I have made for a PC ever!"
5,"Great sound, but you pay for it.","These speakers are really nice. They look great and sound great. I haven't run into any problems with them yet (had them for 2 months or so). I would suggest them to anyone looking for great 5.1 sound an doesn't want muh hassle with the setup.There's only a couple of things I would warn someone about. First, the main controls being on their on stand (volume, input control, etc.) although nice, is fairly large, it's a little wider and taller than one of the speakers, so I had an awkward time trying to find a place for it. So if you don't have much desk space keep that in mind. You could always use the remote or the volume setting on the computer so not a big problem. The second problem is not enough audio settings. There is only a simple ""surround"" volume option to increase the volume of both the rear speakers, which makes things a little difficult if they are not the same distance away from where you're going to sit."
3,need help,"how mobile are the 5 little speaker??i want to be able to put them around my room on every corner, could i be able to use speaker wire for this or are they connected just like the little sister logitech z2300. please respond thank you"
1,Z-5500 Popping Noises with Static...Buyer BEWARE,"This is a WELL DOCUMENTED and virtually admitted design flaw...they have known about this for A LONG time - yet Logitech REFUSES to honor their customer's loyalty. I have a serious problem with that - ESPECIALLY in this economy. I think I will post a YouTube video for all to see - specifically about the z-5500 issue. I hope it goes viral. I would encourage anyone who is interested in the Z-5500 audio system to reconsider and re-think before buying ANYTHING from Logitech if this is how they treat their customers. It is sad really, the Z-5500 WAS a GREAT SOUND SYSTEM - but with the design flaw, it is WORTHLESS. Stand up people, and let your voice be heard. Logitech is being completely UNETHICAL, by admitting - but not fixing, their flaw."
4,Logitech Z-5500 THX sound speaker system,I bought this for my son as a gift. He said it was excellent and was very pleased with it. I have not personally heard it.
5,Great system,Great sound system. Not only do I have this set hooked up to my TV via optical but I have it hooked up to my computer as well using the standard cables. My only gripe is when I switch from HD channels to non-HD on my TV I have to turn off the system (either using the remote or power button) and then turn it back on. I don't know if thats because of my TV or this sound system. Either way I love it. =)
5,still working,"have had this set for just about 2 years new, going to hate when they stop working. if and when they do wish i could buy a nother set, i would pay the same price."
5,It's a Receiver!,"This thing is really cool!Did anybody else find the ""Diagnostic Mode"" you get by pressing and holding the ""Input"" and ""Effect"" buttons simultaneously for six seconds while the unit is off? It starts telling you stream information from your digital sources, just like a receiver does! Very cool!I really like all the inputs I get, especially when I flip the switch on the back to get the three independent stereo inputs.Of course, the ""Volume Boost"" rocks! Take it up to full volume... and then just keep turning! You get a bunch more volume if you need it... but you won't, unless you have a really quiet audio file, but it's there if you need it."
5,Great for the price,I'm writing this review after few months of the purchase. Its one of the great products from logitech. Its been 5 months now. Its performing very good so far. Good quality...but not sure about the durability...Really creates a theater effects at home. bass sounds amazing...great vibration for the price..i have watched lot of movies in DVD with this system...truly crystal clear sound...ideal for mid sized bed room or living room...so far no complaints...Amazon has delivered me a quality product.
5,Z-5500's Absolutely ROCK,"This is the second set of Logitech Z-5500 I own. My first set I bought for my computer and have been extremely happy with them. Im no ""Audiophile"" but I do have a Good ear. the Z-5500's perform well in all audio ranges and they are clean clear and powerful. I bought this second set for use as my home surround sound system on my 47"" Toshiba Regza LCD tv. and I have them set up via optical cable (TOS Link) My FiOS set top box, DVD player and Playstation 3 are all going to the TV via HDMI cables then I went from the TV to the Logich pod via the optical cable and I have pure digital sound and video now and they completely rock My old surround sound system I paid $500 for and are total crap compared to the Logitechs. So whether you are considering buying these for your computer or as a home theater system I say GO FOR IT! BUY 2!"
5,"Hi fidelity, great performance!","I was looking for a speakers set to be used with my livingroom's HDTV, after read several reviews from many websites about Home Theater Systems I chose to buy The Logitech Z5500 because its specifications were just that I needed.I have plugged it to the soundcard trough SPDIF cable, the quality sound and performance delivered from these speakers is amazing, I have watched some movies with Dolby Digital Sound, DTS, THX,... and I have done some sound tests and let me tell you that the subwoofer could blow your mind.My brother in law came by to my house, saw it, loved it and bought another one to him inmediately..."
4,satisfied,The Logitech z-5500 is top of its pc speaker line. I have purched all and was most satisfied with this one.
5,Best speaker system yet,The quality and sound from this is awesome. I have not had problems with it that I was not able to fix either by software settings or checking the connections to my PS3 or my computer sound card.
4,KILLER SPEAKERS!!,"People, this is the best speaker system I ever bought. The bass is awesome. It shakes the house and the neighbors don't like me anymore not that they ever did =) I gave it 4 stars only because it's bigger than I thought it would be. The woofer is slightly larger than a standard milk crate and also really heavy. I still haven't connected 2 of the 5 speakers and I'm thrilled."
5,Wow!,These speakers offer incredible sound - I use them in my home office. I may buy a second set for my home theater system.
1,blown subs,I got this item in october of 06. Within 2 days of the first delivery the sub blew and sounded like absolute crap. I sent it back and got a new one hoping that it was just a fluke. The next set lasted about 2 months before i blew the sub. yeah i might listen to loud music more often then most people but i never turned it all the way up and never had the sub as high as it could go either. It sounds great for the little while it works but i'm pretty upset that this is the second time i have to send it back and im def gonna try another system now.
1,Not happy with the huge Amazon price increase!!,"I added the Z5500s and a Turtle Beach Riviera sound cart to my Amazon cart on Monday. By Friday, when I wanted to place my order - the price for the Logitech's had skyrocketed from $245 to nearly $296. That's a 20% increase.The Turtle Beach sound card has gone up $3 too since I added it - about 10%.I've seen prices change by a few dollars before in items I've added to my cart - but this is ridiculous! I will definitely wait to order until the price returns to normal."
4,"very good but not great, needs a little improvement","gets loud, has lots of power, but the sound quality is just not where i think it could be. its a little harsh sounding. its still a decent system and sound isnt too bad. i have just heard smoother, not as harsh, better sounding stereo systems. if it just had a little better sound quality i would love it. however, it does seem to get a little better as time passes."
2,Sound awful - perplexed by the glowing reviews,"I bought these speakers less than a month ago and after trying really hard to like them for a couple of weeks, I promptly shipped them back to Amazon. I like logitech products (their mice are second to none) and the 5500 is definitely an interesting concept but the execution is poor. Not only is the subwoofer huge and heavy (not necessarily a bad thing) but it sounds boomy and is all over the place - one of the worst subwoofers I've heard. The satellites sound tinny and they do not blend with the subwoofer and there's a huge hole where the midrage should be. I could go on and on, but let me sum it up: If you care about sound quality, save your money and get something else. I gave them two stars because I liked the whole design concept but that's about all I could find positive about them."
4,sounds great but.....,"this system is perfect if you like loud base and want alot of power out of your speakers. But these speakers aren't as clear as it i thought it would be from reading the reviews. i had a BOSE Companion 2 and i think those speakers sounds better than these, but they do lack base and loudness. but overall i am pretty satisfied with these...."
5,Awesome all in one sound system,This is an amazing system for the price. The only full system that beats this out in my opinion is the klipsch promedia 5.1. Unfortunately they no longer sell that system. This is a very good replacement. Placement is everything.
5,The best you can get in this price range!,This set is the best that I had since my Samson studio monitors.I really was surprised how good they sounded.Their price is fairly cheap for what you get in return.Amazing set! I warmly recommend...
2,"High quality, short life","I purchased these speakers just shy of three years ago at their initial MSRP of almost twice their current price. They have been used regularly and always impressed me with their quality and ability to fill a room with rich sound.However, I cannot recommend these speakers. Less than three years of use and the To Rear Right channel terminal has stopped working. This can not be remedied by replacing the speaker or the wire. I spoke with Logitech support who told me the only solution was to purchase an entirely new set at half price, and then mail the broken set back to them at my own expense.Apparently this is a very common problem with this speaker, which commonly progresses into two or three channel terminals ceasing to function before the unit is completely silent. While the high quality audio and affordable price would seem worth it, they are simply too expensive for a speaker system that can only survive a brief three years with nothing but proper use."
4,Logitec Z-550,"I needed to replace my Klipsch 5.1 surround computer speakers. After looking around, it seemed like most of the high end computer surround speakers had been discontinued. The Logitech Z-5500 system seemed to be the best available so, I gave them a try.If you, like me, are interested in quality of construction, materials, and sound, then I think you'll find these speakers acceptable. Quality of sound is on par with Klipsch, although the Klipsch have a bit tighter bass. The center channel can also be mounted on a wall - which provides one solution to the problematic mounting of the center piece."
2,Great System for a Year or Two,"Excellent sound, easy setup, usable as a home theater system with limited inputs. That is all great, but once the system fails, well, time for another. As many one star reviewers mention, the tower will fail at some point. Over a three year period I went thru two of these systems, now I have retired the idea of replacing it and am choosing a home theater system with an av receiver, there are plenty on amazon favorably reviewed.Also, I never paid more than $400 for this system, where they get the $900+ price tag is beyond me.In short, two stars because when it works its great, but don't expect longevity from this system. Now I have two of these speaker systems, the woofer is useless because is integrated with the tower."
4,"Great for DVD Movies, not so much for CD music","Great features and convenience. Too much muddy bass. The subwoofer is not a good match for the rest of the system. I have to keep the subwoofer set at about 1 or 2 on a scale of 10 to achieve a balanced sound. Logitech should do away with the ""digital equalization"" (The Z-5500 Digital actively adjusts frequency response in real time for the cleanest, most accurate sound reproduction) as it supresses high frequencies.Sounds great when viewing movies! My guess is, if your media is in Dolby Digital form it will sound great! Otherwise, not so great."
4,good system,"I shopped around for a pc speaker system, and I listened to a lot of systems, and this system out performed all of them,even the high quality big name brands. Another fine product from Logitech, I LOVE IT."
3,good but not up to expectations,"The product sounds nice, looks nice, and has good connectors and features.But, overall, I was much happier with logitech's speaker systems 6 years ago. The volume level on this unit, despite claiming ridiculously high wattage levels, is nowhere near what I used to get from a top of the line, similarly priced logitech system of years past.Other than that it's pretty good, but for a top end unit that claims such high wattage, it's not even 1/3 as loud as the room shaking system I had for a similar price quite a few years ago from the same manufacturer. I can certainly use the system and the sound quality is good, but it's not what I expected."
3,Warning: Metal Part Of Audio Cable May Break Inside Your Connectors,"First and foremost let me warn you that the tip of one of the audio cable broke off. I noticed this when I unwrapped the cables. Had I put that into my sound card and had it break off in there I would have been very very upset. Wonder if they'll send me new cables?Second, the bass is not that good. It's probably the best available for a computer, but it doesn't produce very deep bass."
5,Excelant! Great sound need a little tweeking...,I Love these speakers... Now I want to clarify they are not no bose but for there price they are deffenatly worth the money! I read several reviews on this product before I bought it and decided that some people just dont know what they are talking about... I highly recomend to have a computer or amp that is made for 5.1 surround sound or above it still will work other wise but need to put it on stero 2x... Anyway bottem line is great speakers need to adjust some of settings to make it great but thats not to hard to do!
5,Great 5.1 sound system for iMac,Easy hookup to optical out of an iMac. Great sound.With this system and a LCD projector you have everything you need toturn your office into a home theater too.My only problem is chasing the kids out so I can get some work done.I use it mostly for DVDs and movies downloaded from iTunes.I am eagerly waiting for HD movies on iTunes. I have watched some of theTV shows with HD and 5.1 sound and you can really tell the difference.If your DVD has 5.1 sound it is worth checking that the sound preference in DVDplayer is set to digital out.
5,Amazing,"Honestly, these speakers are awesome, and Amazon just raises the bar and is more awesome every day.The sound quality is great, definitely worth the money. The dolby surround sound makes all your music sound fantastic, and what can i say they are loud!I bought them for 223, less than a week later the price dropped to 189 and Amazon refunded the difference after i told them, seriously great customer service.Oh, did i mention you should get these speakers? :)"
4,Not bad for the $!,"Found this set-up on Amazon for about $270- which I thought was fair. It's pretty hard to get anything that sounds decent for under a grand so you could say that this was a solid purchase. They do a good job for a small price. The sub is fair but as you might have guessed tends to get in over it's head(not enough amp).I would have rather had a more punchy 8"" sub instead of an under powered 10"".The best part of this whole deal is that you can use it for PC, DVD, Gaming, or THX for a bedroom without having to unplug it from one thing to the next. Everything is fairly simple to hook-up. Have Fun!"
5,Unreal!,Words cannot describe the clarity and power of this system! Not to mention that the list price is $400 and Amazon sells it for under $200 (not including shipping). I recommend trying it for yourself.
4,Good value for low cost surround system,"I have owned several surround systems. I bought this specifically because I wanted something lower cost that would support 2 digital inputs. The real motivation was that it was going into the Rec room and if/when the kids damage it I didn't want to have too much invested.The units meets my expectations. The sound quality is good, the system is simple, and it was simple to install. I have 2 reservations. 1. the mounting brackets for the satellite speakers are limiting, 2. the fiber optic plug is located to closely to the digital coax cable so it does not positively insert with the larger back shell of a monster brand fiber optic cord. Overall, it is a good unit with quality sound and an excellent value in this price range."
4,Logitech Z-5500,"This is a great product and worth the price. The sound on games, video and movies is exceptional."
3,Was great - until...,"These speakers sounded and worked great for the first three months, until the fuse blew in the sub. I tried to replace the fuse with the specified replacement part and it just kept blowing fuses. I ended up having to return it to Amazon. If you do a google on Z5500 + fuses, you'll see this model is prone to blowing fuses, I didn't know about this because I only read the Amazon reviews."
5,Logitech Z-5500,"I bought this system a long time ago, and it still works like new. I can't turn the sound up all the way because I'm worried that these babies will shake my walls down and blow off women's clothes. I connected this unit to a Psyclone HDMI/optical selector to use with my computer, PS3, and Xbox 360. I had to connect my HDTV through the 3.5mm jack, but I still get surround sound. It won't be an IMAX experience, but I have a medium sized room, so the Z-5500 system sounds amazing. These can be the best intermediate level 5.1 speakers that you can ask for, relative to the price (I paid about $200 for this system shipped)."
5,Best place to buy!,"The price was 212$ was the lowest price for this item than anywhere else, but shipping that cost everything. I dont have choice other than buying from Dell, where shipping is free 219+taxes=233$.I'm waiting for the item to arrive, but i'm sure i will be happy about my decission based on the reviews!"
4,Great,"For the current price it is a killer deal. I previously had the older system(forget the real name) it was 380 RMS wattage however. The new system is noticeably better, the sound is amazing, the only con at all is that the sub seams to be missing just a little power... I plan on opening it up and see if i can crank it up just a little. The additional cable options are great, I recommend the fiber optics."
4,Good cheap HT system,"These speakers a nice for the price. I already own a pair of Klipsch Promedia Ultra 5.1s. I tested them back to back when I first got the Z-5500s in this afternoon. Really good but not great. The highs aren't all that nice. But like the title says, I got this to watch movies on the TV and it's great. Wonderful speaker system. Couldn't recommend it more (since the Klipsch Ultras are discontinued)."
4,Logitech Z-5500,"I bought this a few days a ago and it shipped overnight which was very nice.Pros:great sound, easy set-up, no need to buy a recieverCons:I Needed a converter cable to hook it up to my TV, the wires to the back speakers were not long enough.Over all a great system and with about $20 of extra cable/wiring I was able to get it set up and running in one try."
4,mas,"overall the sound quality is better than other computer speaker system, sharp and crip. you can def hear surround effectthe only thing that i'm concerned is bass - not enough power to pump up bass, but is decent enough as long as you plug into optical"
1,"The Z-5500 SUCKS, and so do Logitech.","I did bought this set of Z-5500 they lasted 2 weeks.I tried to get an RMA from Logitech but they didn't bother to answer.Logitech Forums are dead and so the customer support.DONT BUY THIS, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.This speakers dont ""Shake your House""...The SubWoofer sounds like trash, try ""Heroes del Silencio - Entre dos tierras"" and you will ear how they really sounds.The Control Pod turns off from time to time.At high volumes (75%) satellites sound DISTORTEDMost of the time when connected to a Playstation 3 you get ""NO SIGNAL"" in the control pod.This Speakers are only good for a Movie or a game... BUT they will fail and you wont be able to get a new set or your money back. Logitech SUCKS.Go get something from CREATIVE they WONT LET YOU DOWN!."
1,Typically Logitech,"A typically poor quality Logitech item. After ONE day of owning this, the display unit malfunctioned and does not display anything. I am now 3 for 3 with junk Logitech items. My web cam fell apart after two weeks, my Free Pulse headphones broke after 3 weeks and this item broke after 1 day. Yet another disappointment from Logitech. Amazon, on the other hand, is being great about returning and replacing."
5,BETTER THAN PERFECT,"I purchased the Logitech Z-5500 three months ago. These speakers are crispy clear at high volumes. The subwoofer has a large 10"" woofer, design just for what there made for high-fidelity sound with it's THX reproduction system. With 505 RMS/1000 peak watts, these speaker withstands all the highs and lows I throw at them at peak volumes.If your looking for a home threater sound system this is it.I highly recommend these speaker to anyone who is in the market for perfection."
5,Bass you can feel in the chest!!!,"i want to thank amazon.com for the fast FREE shipping (two days is all it took). this Z-5500 system is one of the best purchases i have ever made. Logitech have always amazed me with their speakers and after i have listened to the 5500, i am begining to respect this company because they deliver, always; be it the Z-3 series, Z-2300's or Z-5500's. I say buy these, hook 'em up, play 'em loud, and enjoy the bass."
4,Very nice,"I am very happy with these speakers. I bought them for my computer, but I decided to use them for my TV which is in a different room. I am not too impressed with them for playing music, however they are great for watching dvds in surround sound. I would have given them 5 stars, but I noticed a lack of highs. Sometimes the speakers sound like they are clipping when a high frequency sound is emited. These speakers are VERY clear and the bass definatley rattles the windows of my house. If you are buying speakers for movies and gaming these are the speakers for you. If you are going to be soley using them for music I would look elsewhere. Overall, I am very satisfied."
4,Super Power Sound Experience,This is an excellent high power product.I use the system in a virtual sound suite and it rocks. I can simulate any environment providing I have a good source recording.The remote control makes for easy adjustments.
4,"Great Product, follow the instructions & you'll be good","Pros: Digital Dolby, DTS, THX certified, sounds great on HBO HD and all the channels that support Digital Dolby, i'm using an optical cable, with the cox box & PS3 as well as the Power Mac G5, aux for the iPodCons: not any really wish the cable for the speakers were longer"
1,uhhhhmmmmm,this is not a metal band. this is not a hardcore band. this is not a metalcore band. get it right.
1,FBTMOF new stuff is garbage,OMFG!!! this album sucks hardcore. Take NIN Marylin Manson or just about any other gay sounding mainstream band and you have this album in a nutshell. P.S. what happened to such a great band maybe the fact that over half of the members left is why they suck now. dont buy!!!
4,a pleasure to read,"How Babies talk is a great book for anyone that has, or works with children. This easy to read, up to date, parents survival guide, is filled with the latest scientific research to inform parents and professionals about language acquisition. A wonderful book!!"
4,Really interesting.,"I had to read this book for a linguistics class. I am glad I did. You will find it very interesting, especially if you are expecting."
3,If you have a late talker not the book for you,"My son is 16 months and this book was helpful in pointing out to me that he was saying things, I just was looking for better formed words and not listening very well (chalk it up to first time mom)!However, the book states that the average age a baby talks is 12 months, but can go to 24 months. There was a study mentioned in their book that stated the average first word in the study was produced at 13.5 months.I do not think this book is helpful for parents trying to find encouragement and answers as to why their child isn't talking. Most of the examples they give of first word talkers at 12 and 13 months. There is mention of a 17 month 1st word talker, but their reason was because he had ear infections.I would have liked to read more examples of later talkers without any ""ear infections"" or disabilites being the case."
1,Horrible audio quality,"Horrible audio quality. Several times we have had to go to another telephone so the party we were calling could understand us. The quality of audio we hear is fine, but the person we call has big problems. It appears that the microphone is far too sensitive and distorts the sound. Also any little sound in the room near us is easily picked up and adds to the distraction. Don't buy!"
5,This Book Ministered to Me Like No Other!,"Jan Coleman's book speaks to your heart, mind and soul! This is the first book in years that I've read A.L. (After Locusts) from cover to cover. Jan speaks to you as if you were a long-time friend sitting at her kitchen table, bringing tears to your eyes as well as a knowing smile to your lips. Sharing her own experiences as well as those of other women, she candidly recognizes that you are not alone in your struggles, and assures you that there IS light at the end of the tunnel as well as a rainbow after the storm. Reminding us of God's promise, ""For I will restore to you the years the locust has eaten."" Joel 2:25, she comforts you like the arms of a dear friend. This book ministered to me like no other!"
4,works with Simon2 alarm system by ITI (GE),"It was easy to install, once I reviewed my alarm system installation docs along with the instructions on the remote touchpad. Comes very handy if you cannot place your alarm panel next to your exit door, or if you have multiple exits from your house. Just attached it with velkro on the door, so it doesn't get lost. Even though it is not listed as such, it seems compatible with my Simon 2, and it was more affordable than the other options."
3,"Rushed tempi,and an original pianoforte make this a tiresome listen!","Having heard these Haydn Concerti done on both harpsichord and piano (and having played one of them) over the years, my ears grew tired of the ""Jane Austenesque"" spinet sound of the Andreas Staier's ""romantic era"" pianoforte.As charming an idea it is to hear a ""real"" pianoforte in order to recreate how audiences of Haydn's time would have heard things,all I can say is ""Thank God that the instrument progressed to where it is today!"" .Staier's technique leaves much to be desired on this instrument.The sound falls dead-away and gets very annoying after a while.Not recommended."
5,Scarce words - plentiful meaning,"I do not have words for this book (No pun intended!)Desiderata - an extremely moving book, is one of it's kind, in the truest sense of the word. It has words in the form of a poem and pictures depicted alongside of the words. Each picture is hardly a scrawl and the accompanying words are extremely simple, and yet together, they tell you so much of life and how to live it.The utter simplicity of the pictures and the words is truly unparalleled and leaves a lasting impression on you.Highly, highly, highly recommended."
4,DESIDERATA,FINE POEM STILL HAS MEANING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS READ IT MANY YEARS AGO AND REDISCOVERED IT RECENTLY THROUGH A FRIEND
4,The King wears the Crown,"I'm a huge Busta Rhymes fan! I've never seen this in stores and thought I'd take a chance. This is a great CD! 26 songs with great guest appearances from some of the newest rappers. The beats are great, the lyric content is good (of course explicit)but, a definite head banger. Plus the main reason, Busta sounds so sexy as usual."
5,HIV and the pathogenesis of AIDS,"This is really excellent book about HIV. It is easy to understand but contains nearly all advanced recent topics including history, immunology and pathogenesis of HIV. Especially for the students who study HIV, this is the best reference for general and specific knowledge."
2,Slightly disappointing,"I was a little disappointed by the book. It is not on the level of most text books these days, which make reading scientific material a pleasure. This is usually achieved by many color figures, boxes with short explanations that summarize the central notion of concepts discussed in a chapter, and so on.Furthermore, the writing was very ""dry"" and technical. The feeling I got was that each sentence was simply a summary of a published manuscript , with no additional insights or any attempt to ""unify"" all the vast amounts of information on HIV into something more whole.I am now writing my Ph.D. thesis on HIV evolution. Unfortunately, I found that I prefer to read reviews on the subject rather than use the book as a guide."
4,Captivating,"Henning Mankell takes us away from Ystad and Wallander to the North. Stefan Lindman, another Swedish inspector (with issues almost equalling Kurt Wallander) is out of his district, involved in a homicide of a former colleague, and again shows us that discerning the correct path is hard, tedious, and often misleading. More upbeat than some Wallander novels, this book was a pleasure to read."
3,Translation potholes,"A great yarn, but I agree with the earlier reviewer who complained about the translation. The narration was too frequently disrupted by bad grammar like huge potholes in the street. Too many pronouns of the wrong gender and such made this often painful to read. It's too bad because this is an excellent story.This was my second Henning Mankell read, and I almost dropped him. However, I have read three others since and found the translations almost transparent. Only a hiccup here and there."
4,Thoughtful,"Henning Mankell was the first one of the army of Scandinavian mystery writers to get recognition in the USA. It is easy to see why. Beautiful craftsmenship, vivid characters and a hell of a lot to say. And over and over again I have to suffer through dozens of badly written reviews of people who should seriosly reconsider why they read books in a first place.Did they run out of mindless TV shows to watch? Or was they computer in the repair shop, so they couldn't play the amusing games?I am not a policeman, but the Scandinavian and British investigators seem just so much real that their American counterparts. And so does everything else. The notions we have about ourselves are as real as our TV shows. Feel good, but empty and so unfullfilling."
1,Total Waste of Time,"> Poor plot, empty dialogue, and 1-dimensional characters kept having the same conversation even using the same words.> Annoying & tiresome protagonist couldn't stop self-pitying which evoked not sympathy but only impatience after 2 discs.> Terrible performance - couldn't tell which person was talking because they were assigned the same voice characters.> Would have given no stars if I could."
1,Yeahnah.,"Not a great friend of crime novels at the best of times, I read this because it was given to me by a friend. I read it dutifully to the end - to humour my friend and to find out why everyone is talking about Henning Mankell. Yes, it is well crafted, but the characters failed to grab or involve me, and the story, well, how many reheats of Nazi stories do we need? Anything by Christoph Ernst (Keine Zeit fuer Helden) or Lee WoodKingdom of Silence (Inspector Keen Dunliffe Mysteries)) I have read with more enjoyment."
5,Keeping it Fresh,"First of all,let me say I questioned the introduction of a new dectective by Mankell ..as readers of the Kurt Wallander series we have gotten to know and understand most of what makes him tick. Now we meet another police officer ,in another place with his own set of problems...cancer of the tongue obviously the most serious of these.Forget that...I should have known there was a plan here.The story takes off like a forest fire and offers us the most visual and terrifying of all of Mankell's books.I literally could not put the book down until it was finished.Get hooked, get the whole series and read this BEFORE ""Before the Frost'"
2,"OK, but I need more...",This book is an ok overview of the network operating system but I need more. I know some company named Wave Technologies is developing a bigger & better self-study kit with multi-media and stuff but not sure where to find it at Amazon. I think you should buy this book to start and then probably buy Wave's to really cover the important topics.
5,Just the Facts,"Excellent approach to a relevant topic coming out of the middle east. As a westerner the topic of suicide bombings is vague and often viewed as a method of religious extremism. Baer quietly diassects the reasonings behind the suicide missions and what makes them so effective. It's a historical look back at the beginnings all the way to the London attacks of 2005. Effective, chilling, and diabolical reasoning stand behind them. From the perspective of the bombers, its completely rational and logical. Well documented and well presented without speaking down to the audience who just may be learning about suicide bombers. Its as if the viewer is to take over a case load from Mr. Baer."
2,CHEAP stuff,"Thought this would be a real go getter but when I got it and unfolded it, it was just cheap junk. It might've lasted one season of cooking. If that's all you're looking for for $30.00 there are much cheaper alternatives. Sent it back with no problems."
3,Cheaply made,"Took this grill on a camping trip, and it worked fine with one caveat - the grill started to get bent out of shape. It's clear that the metal is too thin and the heat from the coals started to warp the grill. But it was relatively light, portable, and cooked fine. And cheap!Just don't expect it to last very long."
4,Bayou Classic Grill,"I love this grill,I would tell my family and friends to buy it. Comes already assembled and it has it's own carring case. Cool!!Bayou Classic Fold and Go Portable Grill"
2,Bayou Classic Fold and Go Portable Grill,"1) Without a lid it makes it tough to cook food properly; 2) The grill has gaps at the base which allow for heat loss, and trying to seal them with foil is impossible; 3)no lip around the grill to keep hotdogs from sliding off the grate; 4)disposing the coals is a messy hassle. All this means that I wouldn't buy this grill again."
3,Grill on the go,"I thought I would use this at the beach or at the park, but I haven't. The build quality is good, and it sets up fine, but it is just a bit bulky, and then having to carry it home dirty even in the bag was never appealing."
2,Cheap grill,"Yes you can cook on it, but it's thin metal and should have spent more and gotten a real portable Bar-B-Que."
4,Decent grill for the money!,I purchased this grill for a camping trip that My husband and I had planned. I was very satisfied with both the grill and the size of the cooking area. I've had no problems with the grill warping. Very satisfied with this product.
5,Urgent recording,"This is one of the very best live performances of Tristan & Isolde. Carlos Kleiber makes wonders and I have always liked the specific Bayreuth acoustic. I have heard Ligendza and Brilioth live many, many times. Ligendza uses her not too large voice with the utmost intelligence and she has the right feeling and understanding for Wagner's tone language. She was very popular in Bayreuth. Brilioth was uneven, but when in form had one of the most beautiful Wagner voices I have ever heard. His voice sometimes could sound like a stream of gold. His Tristan at the MET was very well received. This is a very good complement to an ordinary stereo studio recording!"
2,disappointing,"Actually, The sound is not that great for a modern recording. The Isolde is very disappointing though so many say she is committed the the music. PLease, Shirley Verrett gave a much better performance of the Liebestod withMehta at Avery Fisher Hall around the same time and she was no Wagnerian. The orchestra is wonderful. Can't wait to get rid of it!"
4,"Pretty good, but I've read better.","I was really hoping the next B-Tech book to come out would follow the plot line of the I.S. or clans, but I had to settle for this.It was ok though, good action but still i think that the Mechwarrior series will not be the same to dedicated Battletech readers. A good book for beginers, or just for cheap thrills."
1,Broken,"The Tri-Flow Superior Lubricant may be ""superior"" but the product arrived broken so I had no way of testing it"
1,didn't work,"I bought it for my bike sometimes it has strange noise in chain and other parts, but when u use it. it doesn't stop sound of noise :\"
2,WHAT THE F#*K HAPPENED!!!,"I don't know what happened to these guys ,but they got lost making this CD. Influenced by someone or something that took this one in a whole different direction. There are shades of old,but only a bit here and there.If you liked Asylum Of The Human Predator,don't buy this one. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is some of the drums and guitar are still good. BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME..."
1,Too Small,Recently ordered these shoes for the price. I wear a size 14's and could not even get these on my feet. Not sure if they stamped the shoe with the wrong label (they said 14) but they were tiny. On the plus side they were easily returned.
4,so far so good,"i use this in my 2 stroke generator. the spark plug looks good and is cleaner than using a conventional 2 stroke oil. the exhaust kinda smells like a deep fryer when running. it did take it sweet time getting to me though, partly because the seller seemed slow to ship and because the seller is not a amazon prime vendor."
4,Very usefull for a beginning astrologer.,"My daughters used this until it fell apart, charting all their friends and prospective boyfriends. It is great book for a beginner to start learning the aspects of the natal chart. It cuts out all the math and makes charting very easy, you can get right into the interpretation."
3,"Taurus w/Moon in Aries, no, wait, Moon in Pisces?","Bought the 1998 edition of this to get updated planetary tables through 2050 but what do I find but that the chart position of the moon has moved backwards several degrees most years. For example, in the 1978 edition, for my birthdate the moon was in Aries but in the 1998 edition, it was in Pisces. Did comparisons for other years and dates and found the same thing. Was not happy to find inconsistency between the two editions. Other than that, Grant Lewi's interpretations are great."
4,Entertaining,"I think that this book absolutely nails most people. It is very accurate with my chart, and I just did my girlfriend of two years chart and I wish I had done it sooner. It took me a very long time to figure out the things it could've told me along time ago. I think that it is both entertaining and useful."
5,Heaven Knows What,"I believe this book was originally published in the 1940's. The author, Grant Lewi, was very knowledgeable about astrology. It is a very well written book. Basically, it shows you how to draw up your own astrological chart and interpret it."
5,One of the best,"If you have had your chart done by a computer or if you have one or more cookbooks and are frustrated with how disjointed the reading you get is get this book to show you how to put the complex aspect patterns together. Lewi seems to be the only one who works aspect patterns out like a chain and the fact no one else does this is just plain frustrating. The only draw back is he doesn't cover the planets in the signs only the sun/moon combinations which, are most accurate. Get this book if your just learning to interpret charts. Also, this book will help to convince you astrology is way more then the those silly sun sign horoscope columns."
3,Ok not Great,This book bored me. I really can't say much else. I think you will have to go with the average of great reviews vs not so great reviews and make your decision based on that since this book is out of print and not readily available to thrumb through at your local bookstore or metaphysical bookstore.
3,Flawed Editions,"Only the Eleventh Edition (1998) has the blue and yellow sunburst cover being shown.Tenth and Ninth editions, 1994 and 1990, have the ""gold"" cover. All three editions havethe same ISBN. Too bad!The ninth edition has tables to only 1999 --- not too useful in 2011.The tenth edition has tables up to 2050, that much is good; unfortunately the instructionson how to use the tables has errors! Also the Horoscope Blank has one misprint (for theSaturn in the same space with Pluto reference).The ELEVENTH EDITION, the one pictured, is a ""finished and correct"" product. The 9th- and 10th-editions are transitional and they show it."
5,Good quality bolts,These will make a great replacement for my old rusted out battery terminals. They fit perfectly in my battery. Now my battery will get better response I think for having new connections in there. A great investment if you have rusted out terminal bolts. Shiny chrome adds to my car theme.
2,The old games with a bad interface,"These are fairly accurate reproductions of the origin games that a lot of us grew up with. As fun and exciting as they were then, they had interfaces for each game that was designed for the game (joysticks, buttons, etc). All of these use keyboard controls that make the experience much less fun and sometimes frustrating, some next to impossible. It would have been about 99% better if they would have allowed use of your mouse. I view this one as a waste of money. (Guess I should have tried the one for the PS2 instead)"
1,Felt,Here is how you can make this at home.Step 1.Go buy a piece of feltIt is felt. Just felt. That is all.
1,Could Have Made it Myself,"This was so not worth the purchase. I could have purchased some felt, a large piece of PVC pipe and elastic and made it myself. Keep looking."
4,Bought as a gift.,My friend reports that this product works very well for storing her puzzles in between sessions so she no longer has to hide it under the table cloth!
4,puzzle storage,"I must admit that I have not yet used this product, but am planning to start today. I had seen the puzzle mat at a relative's home last year and then forgot about it until I spent a quiet week at a resort, which included doing a jigsaw puzzle. However, the puzzle was not complete by the time I left (almost, though), so I had to break it up to bring it home. Then I remembered the puzzle mat, which I had never seen before. I ordered one as soon as I returned home. Though I haven't used mine yet, I have seen how it works and it is wonderful for someone who loves to do puzzles, but doesn't have the room to keep it out on the table all of the time."
4,Good for coming up with ideas for date night,"While several of the suggestions in the book are things that you have already done, or would think of yourself, there are also some creative ideas too- Sometimes you just fall into the routine of everyday life and need to do something to rekindle the romance. The nice suggestions are sweet, and the naughty suggestions are fun without being kinky. Good for coming up with ideas for date night when we're just out of ideas."
3,Not exactly what I was looking for,"Thought this would be a great way to re-kindle a 22 year marriage..however, miniature golf and ice cream afterwards wasn't the suggestion I had hope to get. The naughty suggestions were lame at best."
5,If the old timers had these machines there wouldn't be any,"The improvements in technology have corresponded inversely to the number of prospectors. Erosion during the past century has exposed millions of tons of virgin substrata for prospectors of today, and metal detectors will increase the chance of discovering new placers.There's no better expert on metal detector technology than Garrett. Great as those detectors are, they require some training to use them. Garrett provides the best 'how-to' advice available. His book will give you the straight-forward means to practice with it before you begin trekking into the canyons or sweeping old school yards for coins.Learn how to do it and you still mightn't find gold, but you'll certainly find the greatest treasure of them all: solitude."
2,Unless you have or inted to buy a Garrett,Unless you have a Garrett or are thinking about buying only a Garrett detector this book is of little value. Thinking that this book would contain valuable information from one of the industry founders I was excited to purchase. From the start the author says he has a love for Garrett detectors and the book is meant to advise and help in genera and not push one brand of detectors. However throughout the book the Garrett detectors are pushed and referenced as the best choice. There is little reference made to any other brand and the book gets very specific as to utilizing Garrett devices. I found the book to be little value as I had not yet purchased a metal detector and really wanted to learn in general about the hobby from one of the greats... While there is some good information concerning general metal detecting I found the majority of the book giving praise to Mr. Garrett and really just a long sales brochure for Garrett detectors. Disappointed.
2,Plain advertising,This book contains very little genuine information. It basically says that Garret's patented pan and detector are the best suited for gold prospection.It develops at length the setting of the ground balance of the detector which is famous for its difficulty to use.
5,the goombas book of love,"As soon as I heard that Bobby Bacala had a new book out, I had to get one right away! I even bought an extra few to give out as Christmas presents (just like I did last year with the Goombas guide to life). When I am stressed with my everyday life I like to pick up his book(s) and get away from it all for a little while because Steven Schirripa is definitely an entertaining writer..... I'm looking forward to another book before next Christmas, too??????? Thanks!"
5,Long Lost Recording,First bought Spencer the Rover in 1971 at the now defunct Briggs and Briggs music in Harvard Square Cambridge MA. Long out of print and sorely missed a wonderful recording of classic English songs
4,Richly imaginative tales best told around campfires,"Firstly, I don't assume that anything in this book can be taken too seriously. Almost nothing here would stand up to any type of scientific examination. This is just a fun collection of stories. And, as such, it is one of the best rides of its genre. If you ever want to escape reality for a little while, pick up this book."
3,What the?,"This was the first John Keel book I have read, and I must say I didn't even finish it, I just put it up on my bookshelf. I have never read such a boring take on such an interesting subject."
5,The Complete Guide to Mysterious Beings,"I bought my first copy of this book back in 1970 when it was first published under the title ""Strange Creatures From Time and Space"". Back then, someone had borrowed it from me, and I never got it back. This is a great book, which made me a John Keel fan for life. I love all his books."
3,Not the best case against spanking,"This book may have been good about 20 years ago, but there are much better methods available today. He makes a good case against spanking, but offers options that only spoil the child (rewards, etc). I much prefer the books ""Setting Limits for your Strong-Willed Child,"" and ""Taming the Spirited Child Without Breaking Their Spirits."" Both books agree that spanking is not effective (and traumatic), but offer more effective alternatives. (My kids responded beautifully to them) I would say that this author did a lot of important work, but the newer books are more effective."
3,Does EVERYTHING have to be described to the nth degree?,"As much as I wanted to like this book (being a Virginian and matriculating in the Shenandoah Valley at JMU), I found that Mr. Buhrer's writing style relied much too heavily on mundane details...who cares how many pizzas they ate? I surely lost track and would have enjoyed seeing him delve into the characters more deeply."
2,I liked this movie as a kid,"I likes this movie as a kid...14 years old and I really liked Hidegaard Knef...all the Hammer ladies in fact. BUT move up to 1971 and I read my first William Hope Hodgson novel, ""The Boats of the Glee Carig"" and the whole appeal of ""The Lost Continent"" went out the window. I disliked the movie because it couldn't COME close to the weirdness of Hodgson's book. So, one have to be fair. I sought out ""The Lost Continent"" novel...as another reader said, no easy thing and although there are some things in HP Lovecraft that can make one uncomfortable. ""Lost Continent"" is worse. The 20th century changed us greatly. Also, I founf the book dull, especially when comp[ared with ""Carig."" If I had read ""The Lost Continent"" before everything else, maybe I would feel differently, but it doensn't touch Hodgson's work in my mind. Sorry."
5,Most Valuable Information for Raising a Bilingual Child,"This book is for a very particular reader and I am DEFINITELY that reader. I am living in Japan and raising my daughter to be bilingual in Japanese and English. This book provided me with so many answers to questions I didn't even know to ask. It gives detailed research results on American/Japanese families living in Japan regarding their children's language acquisition. See the book for details, but did you know that most children growing up in this situation do not become active bilinguals? I was shocked! It takes an active role on the parents to teach the minority language, which in Japan would be English. If you plan on raising your kids in Japan this is VALUABLE information! I give it an unreserved five stars and wish I had found it two years ago when it first came out."
4,Awesome. get it,This is probely Millencolin's best CD. If you don't have any of their CDs you should get this one first. If you don't like one of the songs then the next one you will like. some of the songs are sort of weird (Monkey Boogie) but most are really good (twentytwo).
1,Horrible,"This CD is absolutely the worst CD I've ever heard in my entire life! How anyone could sit and listen to this stuff is beyond me. The lyrics are bad, the music is much worse, if you want good music don't buy this CD."
4,"Insiteful, Informative. Love it!","I found this book to very informative and insightful. However I thought that some of the dialougue was hokey. This tells you pretty much everything you probably already know, but there are a few extras that I didnt know and it helps. There are alot of different siuations covered from intimacy, different types of contraceptives to loosing your lover to AIDS."
3,desperately-seeking Susan,"This is one movie that I'm not overly crazy about. I hate it when Joan's in a movie and she's not the center of attention and she's almost just there to liven things up and capture an audience. Even though the story was built around her character it seemed like she was missing in action for most of the movie (in both mind, body and spirit.) My favorite scene was towards the beginning when Susan made her grand entrance on the speed boat. This movie reminded me of ""When Ladies Meet"" which is another one that I'm not too crazy about. Excepts for perhaps ""Strange Cargo"" most of her later MGM pictures weren't nearly as good as the ones she made after or before them. The actor who played her husband in this was certainly no Clark Gable but nevertheless Joan still tries to give it her best shot."
3,"If you like Christopher Pike, you'll probably love it...","I'm giving this one 3.5/5 stars as an adult. If I were a teenager, I would have given it 4 stars. It could have been a lot more spooky and gory. But from what I hear that's not the authors style...well this is a ""teen"" sort of book so maybe it SHOULDN'T be that way haha. I'm a huge horror fan so that's what I like.The only thing I would have liked better about this book, is if it had more to do with Halloween. Being named Trick or Treat it didn't have a whole lot of Halloween themed stuff, which is the #1 reason I picked it up in the first place.This author is definitely up there with Christopher Pike & I wish I had known about her books when I was a teenager reading R.L. Stine and Christopher Pike's books.Look for a more in depth review of this on my Horror movie/book review blog Shivers of Horror. Link in my Amazon profile."
4,"Suspense, murder and a touch of romance.","From the minute Martha moves into her new house, something doesn't feel right. Then she finds out that the girl who lived in the house before her was murdered. Her new step - brother Connor, is so mysterious he almost frightens her. Her new friends, especially Blake, are great. But Martha begins to feel like there's someone watching her, following her every move, and then the pranks begin.... Excellent book, I think 'The Lifeguard' and 'The Beach House' are by the same author. This book is so good it's falling apart from being read so many times!"
5,Happy,"The book I ordered was a very old book to begin with, and I am pretty sure its not in print anymore. It came to my house on time and was in prefect like new condition. I am very happy with their service! :)"
5,One of my fave YA horror books!,"I read this book as a teenager, and I fell in love with it. Cusick's writing makes you feel as if you're running over the crunchy leaves in the abandoned graveyard with her. I remembered this book as an adult, and finally got my hands on a copy. It was just as chilling as I remembered. I highly reccommend this!"
2,Not A Treat,Martha father remarries.So Martha now has a new Stepmother and aStepbrother named Conor.Another new thing in Martha's life is a house.The Bedford house which everyone says is evil.A boy named Dennis supposely killed his grilfriend Elizabeth in a fit of jealousy in the very room that is now Martha's.All on Halloween night.Now strange things are happening like scary phone callsand Martha feels someones watching her yet who. Everyone says Dennis Died but did ? I did'nt like this book because all the author plots are to similar.
4,Play Along,Thinking about exploring the world of fingerstyle guitar? This excellent instruction video is for you. Whether you are an expert or novice making headway at fingerstyle could not be easier.
5,Pure Country Classics!,You can't get anymore country than this! This album contains the best songs that Johnny Cash has recorded.
3,At San Quentin & At Folsom Prison,Being a Johnny Cash music lover I found these two to be excellent recordings. Will treasure these forever.
4,Crows Over a Wheatfield,"Melanie grows up with a ""mean"" father and a recluse of a step-mother, who is the mother of her half-brother Matt. Matt is the same age as Melanie, and there the plot begins.Melanie's father wants Matt to be a lawyer as he is; Matt struggles with the mental torture and suffers a breakdown. Melanie grows up to be a judge, surpassing her abusive fathers wonderful reputation as a defense lawyer.The book touches on the legal system and abuse where women and children are concerned. The story dives into the depths of what is not seen in abuse, making the novel at times suspenseful. Melanie's character is so strong.I may have read this book at the wrong time, as I found it a little dry, though the writing style was perfect. The characters are strong, but I still feel I may have missed the ""riveting"" story beneath the story!-Definitely a ""reread"" one day book. -- 4 out of 5 stars"
4,Training a Quaker parrot,It's nice to have a book to refer to and to learn about the parrot. Each Quaker is different so I have learned that hands on training is needed. Purchasing the book to help you select the parrot would have been the better way to go but it's still a good book to have handy.The seller delivered the advertised product in good time and in the condition expected. Nobody could have beat the price.
4,Guide to the Quaker Parrot,Very easy to read and unterstand. It explains alot about the bird and how to look after its health and happiness
4,10 in round chimney brush,Brush works fine and is priced good. Shipping and handling on the other hand was 60% of the cost of the brush!
2,Slightly Disappointed - Review Edited,"I bought the book on the basis of the reviews and on a quick read of a copy a friend owned. It looks really good on the surface and does have a lot of useful information.One problem I found is that many of the example photos seem to be inserted only to increase the photo count. Also, because of printing limitations, I find it very difficult to see the differences between before and after examples.I have edited this review to fix an error. However, I can not figure out how to change my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars. Consider this a 4 star review."
5,Adobe Camera Raw for Digital Photographers Only,This is the second book I have read from Rob Sheppard about digital photography. This is a great book for one who is going from film to digital photography.Dave
3,"Not much for portraits/skin tone, ok for nature","Lots of expamles from nature While I did learn about the raw editing from this book, there was very little about skin tone. The only example they gave was 2 kids watching sharks at the aquarium. The scene had bad mixed lighting and showed ways to fix it. But the faces were turned away from the camera and not much help. I am still looking for a way to get good skin tone out of ACR. The click white balance is not the answer - it's too cool for me. More discussion of portrait color was needed."
5,Very useful discussion of Camera RAW,"This book is one of the reasons I have started shooting in RAW format. Another reason? Photoshop Elements and the free Camera RAW plug-in from Adobe.All in all, the text appears to cover pretty much everything you would really need to know about Camera RAW and how to use it to show your photos at their best.At times the illustrations don't clearly show the subtle changes that result from applying some of the optional settings, but that probably is more a function of the limitations of photo print reproduction in an affordable book."
3,Is this really the 2nd edition?,"I'm confused. The product details for this kindle book says ""Wiley; 2 edition (June 9, 2011)"". But the copyright in the Kindle book (and the Amazon book preview) is 2008 and the latest Photoshop version referenced throughout the book is ""CS3"". This all makes me wonder if I ended up getting the 1st edition."
2,Boring business buzzwords,"This book reads like a standard ""how to succeed in business"" pamphlet, except the author has ensured there is a reference to amazon.com every other page. Most of what's in there is common sense if you've been on the web for any length of time. It's probably aimed at the pointy haired CEO who hasn't yet got a computer on his desk and fancies his chances at this e-commerce thing. If you have an ounce of common sense, you don't need this book."
1,Horrible,"Don't bother with this book, thankfully I only borrowed it from the library intending to use it as a source for an MBA paper on the online book industry. I ended up using zero material in my paper. Most of the sentences aren't complete sentences ... factual errors abound. If Jeff Bezos chose Seattle because Ingram Book Company is there (as Saunders claims) he made a mistake because they're not ... Amazon.com was NOT the first bookseller on the web ... bol.com is not Borders ... the dates for B&N's planned takeover of Ingram are wrong. Who knows what other mistakes there are because I put it down at that point so I didn't mistakenly use any of her ""facts"" in my paper. Saunders should have done at least some research to make the book factual and interesting and her editor should have caught the fact that she was clueless. If your 6th grader or below is writing a paper, it could be ok because the book because is at that reading level ... if you're older than that don't bother."
1,How does junk like this get published?,"This book suffers from bad grammar, factual errors (e.g. ""Federal Trust Commission"" instead of ""Federal Trade Commission""), and devoting an abundance of copy to an elementary discussion of how to build a good web site. I bought the book expecting insights from someone who had firsthand information from people who work at Amazon.com. WRONG. All I got was a regurgitation of what's been written in the press."
2,One word: BORING,"This book was dry, and completely empty. Considering the author didnt even speak to anyone from the company, this book is just a shell of ideas with nothing cohesive or interesting to save it. WASTE of time and money."
2,Not that great at all. Too high-level. Too repetitive.,I think that Saunders could have done nature(and the readers) a lot of good by limiting the book to about 10 pages (instead of 200). Reading this book is frustrating because you feel like you are reading the same points over and over and over again. And she never goes into any depth on anything. Either Amazon didn't want to share anything with her or she got lazy with her research.
1,How much money came out of the pockets of Amazon Executives?,"It seems like more and more these days books are being written by horrible authors that companies could pick up off the streets and have them write a book entirely about their company, but hide it as being a guide to successful e-commerce. If your looking at e-commerce, you don't just focus on one ""semi-successful business"", you focus on the many different e-commerce companies out there and you compare and contrast at their success. This book skims the surface on Amazon...but you are looking for more."
5,well-written and amazingly well thought out.,"even the stuff i knew was synthesized, focused, and analyzed. I found it a good read and an altogether nifty book."
3,couldn't put it down,"because I spilled glue on it. No, just kidding.But I am amazed that Amazon actually charges customers for this book! Shouldn't they be including a free copy with every order!"
1,Poorly written.,Rebbeca's bs. no contents. how can a person write a book this boring? I won't buy any books by Rebecca Saunders in the future.
3,"Good Book, Poor Index","I read the book as a supplement to a class on marketing and selling books. The content of the book was good, but the index was poor. Fortunately, I had marked the things that interested me with PostIt notes. If I had not, I would not have been able to find them. For example, p. 177 tells about the relationship between Amazon.com and small publishers, but I could not tell you how to find that in the index."
1,Nothing New Here!,"Unfortunately you'll not get any astounding insight into how and why Amazon.Com has reached the level of success it has...or why selling on the web has ""brick and mortar"" retailers quaking in their boots from reading this book. The author seems to get most of her information from the press or other books. I got more insight into the company from Segaller's ""Nerds 2.0.1"" (which this author quotes from!). Save your time and money!"
4,"Not Perfect Leon, But Pretty Close","This is vintage Donna Leon. Excellent descriptions of Venice...memorable characters...thoughtful insights into human qualities of honor, honesty, corruption and arrogance. My only criticism is that the ending is tepid and all issues are not fully resolved, in my opinion. Leon is very uneven as a writer. When she's off, she's terrible. When she's on, she's magnificent. In this book she comes off very close to the latter. I would say this is one of her better books."
1,broken case and cassette,THIS ITEM ARRIVED IN POOR CONDITION . THE PLATIC CASE WAS BROKEN AND ONE OF THE CASETTE TAPE WAS BROKEN
4,Cultural treasure,I love this series of Commissioner Brunetti 's Venice. The plot weaves in Venetian locations and Italian culture with interesting plots. Always a great read
5,friends in high places,"As always Donna Leon delights ! her characters are super real and believable .typical of the venetian folk as well as profound in the matter of knowing the Italian ways ,gestures and thinking.this book is a good fit in the Commisaro Brunetti sequences. Paola Ms Brunetti is accurate and my fictional second wife"
5,Human weakness and how it can rise above itself,"The levels of corruption that Commissario Brunetti encounter make for depressing reading at times. Is it really that bad in Venice? I've read elsewhere that indeed it is, but the author seems to carry Brunetti and those he cares for through it all and out the other side so you end up believing that all the city needs is a few more Brunettis to set it right. Leon's novels are more than police procedurals. They're about human weakness and how it can occasionally rise above itself. Always worth reading."
2,Friends in High Places,"This detective novel takes place in Venice, Italy, which is really the best thing about it. It bogs down in many places and is not very well written."
4,Great family film,"Sort of a cross between ""Second Hand Lions"" (but better) and ""Thelma and Louise."" Peter Fonda is an aging sheep-rancher who's dying. He's not had contact with his daughter or grandson since his wife died in a tragic accident falling off a horse. He's tricked into coming into the city to check up on his daughter only to discover that they've set him up for a physical eval. The doctors discover an aneurism.Kristofferson shows up to liberate his boss from the hospital. In the melee, Fonda's young grandson comes along for a wild ride that starts with stealing a hearse and ends with an FBI chase.This is a great film, a lot of honest laughs, and a lot of hard tears. Dakota, the sheepherding horse, was one of the funniest characters in the film. ""Wooly Boys"" is definitely a film I would view more than once and I am contemplating adding it to my collection.If you enjoy the old style Westerns with a lot of humor and heart, this is definitely a film you should consider watching."
4,cute little movie.,"This movie was a cute, funny, touching story about a family reconnecting with each other. The grandson learns some valuable lessons from his grandfather about life."
4,Surface Movie that's Entertaining!,"Very cute story. Not a very deep plot, but still worth watching. I tend to like movies which really make a person think afterward. This is not one of those movies. It's does have some deeper moments, but on the whole, it's a surface movie, that's very entertaining."
1,Don't waste your money or your time.,I bought this video expecting some really good entertainment based upon other reviews. Well I have never been so disappointed. The story line has great potential but the acting is flat and the jokes are poor at best. Don't waste any time or money on this video. If you do remember... you were warned.
4,Sleeper,Entertaining film with veteran actors holding your interest. Good story but with a few holes in it.
5,A great set of small screwdrivers,"These are great because the tips are very strong and the handles let you get decent leverage. It's really a drag when you have a small scre that's been over-tightened and you need to get it out, but your mini screwdriver has a thin, smooth plastic handle and a worn-out tip. That is not a problem with these, I love them.I have owned many sets of Klein, Craftsman, Craftsman Pro, and Snap-On screwdrivers over the years, but I always come back to the Kleins. The tips are incredibly durable, the handles are great and they seem to have all the right sizes.The standard Craftsman sets have terrible tips that wear out in no time. Sure I can get a new one free, but who wants to deal with that? The handles on the Craftsman pro models always seem to leave a tacky film on my hands. And the Snap-on ones are good, but what I consider to be the same quality as Klein for considerably more money.These really are the best of all worlds."
2,Good Reference Book,"This book is an excellent reference book for the serious ghost hunter / paranormal investigator. Provides good case histories as well as ""ghost stories"" that can be used as examples on investigations."
5,Hard to put down!,I find myself drawn to this book like a moth to a flame! It is so interesting and fun to read! I Love all the facts in it! Very happy I bought this book! Still enjoying it and reading it. Found some things I never knew and other things I did with a more in depth view on it.
5,Paranormal Perfection!,"Most of the time I am the person that friends and family come to with their paranormal questions. Sometimes if I didn't have the answer or didn't remember a term or definition or the particulars of a famous case. I would end up going through my notes, or my many books, the Web or Public Library. I usually found what I was looking for however, alot of times it wouldn't be ""exactly"" what I needed, until now. This book has become not only my secret weapon, but the most ""go to"" book on my shelf. All the references, terms, definitions, stories, cases, and Web Sites are up to date and accurate. You've got to have this book!"
3,size caution,I ordered the shoes in a 9 1/2 wide..absolutely love the other pair of eastland shoes I have..newports...and thought I'd love these too..I do...style wise...sturdy construction....etc...but the wide is not wide enough..so I recommend that if you have a wide foot you may need the E width which I have never worn in my life...I am considering ordering but the problem is incurring more return shipping charges.
2,Sole broke within 2 months,These shoes are not very good quality. The sole cracked in half after wearing for less than 2 months.
1,Sole split after one year of use,I loved these shoes until both pairs (brown and black) almost simultaneously had complete splits across each sole after only one year of use. I'm a physical therapist - work in a clinic - I'm not crawling on the floor or doing anything rough on these shoes. These are Eastlands! They should last for years to come - $75 down the drain.
3,The soles split on both shoes,"I love Eastland shoes and I love this style. The thing is, I only had these shoes for about two weeks when the soles split on both shoes at the same location....right at the ball of my foot. Rather than going through the hassle of returning the shoes, I continue to wear them periodically and they are still together. Other than the disappointment of the soles splitting, they are great shoes. If they had not held together the rating would have been a 1."
1,This brand of Eastland shoes,"I hated these shoes! I was very excited when they arrived because I thought they'd be like my others of the same type. But they were patten leather, no real leather look. Also, the size I had before which fit perfectly was now way too small."
3,Yesterday was a lie,Had a hard time getting into this movie. Watched part of it. Maybe I'll try to watch it again someday.
2,Deep as a reflecting pool,"This film is like a reflecting pool. It looks deep and dark, but it turns out to be about three inches deep.The stunning look of the film belies its shallowness. The deep shadows and brilliant highlights make the case that more movies should be made in black and white. The concepts could have been interesting to explore, but the wooden acting and stilted dialog made it painful to watch, pain which was relieved only when ogling Ms Masterson and Ms Kipleigh.All in all it seemed to me to be a case of a screenwriter/director writing a first draft, then filming it. With a little bit of polish applied to the storyline and script, this film could have been really good."
2,Its a book,It was a pretty uneventful reading for me. Others may like it. Nothing ventured nathing gained. It will also look good on your bookshelf.
1,Inadequate Slanted Content,"Oh, I suppose this book could keep some folks married, but only by requiring some women to submit to pretty much any abuse. For example, under a section headed ""The Difficulty of an Innocent Party"":1. If the wife has strayed, the man has this call to action: ""God holds him responsible to cleanse his wife from all impurity by the Word"". Yeah, straighten out, lady.2. However, if the husband has strayed, the wife is reminded that she must follow Scripture or ""rejects the ministry and rewards of suffering for righteousness' sake, which God calls every Christian to accept"". Note that the authors don't see the need to remind the husband of this. So, tough it out lady - God commands that you suffer at the hands of an abusive spouse (?!).The book is replete with this degrading slant - degrading to both partners in a marriage.LilyBelle & David"
5,GREAT! These guys rule! Powerful Melodocore Pop!,"Like his first band, TSOL's, ""Beneath the Shadows"" masterpiece, Jack Grisham takes The Joykiller the next notch higher on the power pop ladder with ""Three."" Punks love to piss people off and this will piss off all the punks who are too conformist to recognize great music when they hear it. F--- you: they're a pop band!!!"
1,SUCKY,This is like the worse I have ever heard of The Joykiller. I heard the music on surf flicks and found out that i was hearing from old Joykiller songs. They must have changed their style because the music just has too much freaking piano tunes and it's too MELLOW to be PUNK!!!
5,Excellent!,"When Marnie's brother is in trouble the only one she can turn to is her estranged husband Guy Frabosa, an ex-Formula 1 driver, Marnie had caught him in bed with another woman. Despite this he wouldn't let her go. This is one of my favorite romances of all time, Michelle Reid has written a great romance with ""real life"" characters that will find their way into your heart."
2,"""usually"" a good product",I have one of these for my own dog (a 14-pound terrier mix) and it works just fine. I ordered this one for a friend of mine with an 8-pound Dachsund-terrier mix and this leash broke within 2 months!!! I will buy a retractable leash from a different company from now on.
5,5 stars,"Exactly what I was looking for and cheaper then pet stores, durable, fits perfect in my hand, like this item very much"
5,Great QUALITY leash!,"I was apprehensive about purchasing this leash online, but I am so glad I did! It's such a great little quality leash, is so durable and works great! I love it and would DEFINITELY recommend it!"
5,perfect leash for small dogs,I have two shitzu dogs which are small and the Flexi leashes which I used for many years has broken the spring inside which lost the rolling back function of the rope. I ordered two new Flexi leashes and they are genuine good product with modern finish than what I used for years. Even the cord is fancy with mixed colors like Indi logo of black and white combination. I am very satisfied with these new leashes.
3,Clip boke after one month,I had this leash for one month and the clip that connects to the harness just snapped. Pretty much worthless now. Before it broke it was fine.
5,Excellent leash,Love this leash allows my Teddybear puppy to roam about on his own while walking him. The quality is excellent. He weighs 17 pounds.
2,Internal parts break easily,"With new puppy that jumps at leaves, this leash only lasted a few weeks after the 10 week old puppy pulled when the stop button was pushed. First the stop button did not work and shortly afterwards the rewind mechanism broke. Not hard use, but cheap. Would be OK for dog not going to pull at all when lock button pushed."
5,Very Nice,"I am very pleased with the Flexi brand quality.Very smooth operation, and light in weight.My Shih Tzu enjoys the extra freedom.Made in Germany.Update: 2 years 1 month later, this leash has nothad one problem and my 17 lb. Shih Tzu iswalked one mile daily."
5,excellent leash,"I bought this same leash again because the other one's innerds stopped winding afrer having it pulled out of my hands and dropped/dragged on the pavement. It is an excellent leash, and would be improved if I could fasten it to my belt, limiting the times it hits the pavement. I would like to see a light attached to it for night walking."
2,Define a large dog,"In the product details it says this leash can be used for very large dogs. So I purchased two for my labrador's. The package arrives very timely and I open up the box and stated on the package ""16 ft retractable leash for dogs up to 26 lbs"". Needless to say this is not what I ordered nor need for my labs. But here is the kicker, to return this product you need a return authorization number that can be provided by customer service whose hours are M-F 8 AM to 5 PM, who has time for this?! Buyer beware, I'd try a different seller on the site."
5,Great Leash,This leash is light weight and great for small dogs. Love it. Very impressed with how strong it is for the size of the leash.
2,half life,"Stopped retracting, plastic shaft worn out inside and retracting wheel wobbles as to jam wheel against outer casing."
2,"Thin cord+plastic snap: Not for terriers and ""bolting"" pups","Purchased this for my 16 pound Jack Russell. Leash Cord: If your pup ""dashes"" and this cord extends at lightening speed, you can easily burn your hands if you try to grab it-like grabbing ""piano wire""(the manufacturer does warn you of this). Even though it is for 26lb dogs, you really wonder whether this will hold the tension that a hyper dog can have on when they ""bolt"". The Collar Snap: this is plastic. The weakest part of the leash. This is the primary reason why this leash is good only for ""lap dogs"" who won't ""challenge"" the durable of this lightweight leash.Will be going back to the good old leather leash and giving this Flexi to my friend with a Pomeranian."
3,Leash has a tendancy to jam,"This leash had good reviews, thats why I bought it! Be aware, this does have a tendency to jam on you. For example while you are walking your dog it is set to release, however it does not and stops your dog from running away. Not sure if I would buy this again."
3,Not very sturdy,"My pet is smaller than 26 pounds, and string broke the first time I took my pet out for a walk."
5,Feast for the Soul -- Absolutely,"Spiritual disciplines are so often treated as the domain of only the most devout Christ-followers. Thompson does an amazing job of making the walk of faith sound inviting, challenging and doable by everyone seeking to nourish their soul. A feast for the soul indeed!"
2,Watered-down version of Celebration of Discipline,"Soul Feast may be wonderful for Sunday School or other group studies, but readers who are looking for a resource for truly deepening their spiritual lives will find this book long on nice-sounding ideas and warm fuzzy feelings, but short on real content and suggestions for practice. It is a watered down version of Richard Foster's seminal work Celebration of Discipline.Soul Feast can be helpful, but don't think you're getting a meaty guide. Every time it starts to seem meaty, there's a footnote to Foster. Buy the real thing."
5,Enrich your spiritual life.,This book is not an easy fix. It requires you to delve very deep into your soul and find yourself and your relationship with God. So worth it!
5,Searching?,Solid and direct this book is filled with sound recommendations and guidance. Beautiful. A true spiritual classic.
4,A very useful book,"This is a nicely written discussion of spirituality. It would be helpful for an individual, and certainly useful for a discussion group.TerrySixth PresbyterianPittsburgh"
2,Not for the average reader,"While this book was read for a discussion group and did elicit some group discussion, it was a difficult read for many including myself as leader. At times, it felt as though it were written for those seeking to spend time in lengthy spiritual retreat--perhaps in a monastery or convent. Some sections and ideas put forth could easily be applicable to the common lay person seeking a deeper faith relationship with God but there were so many instructions for following the disciplines that it seemed overwhelming and impossible to accomplish. Probably a great read for divinity students."
2,Pity about the soprano,"This was performed at Rome in January 2005 as a benefit concert. Being touched by the fact that the sale of the DVD proceeds to the victims of the tsunami in December 2004, I didn't hesitate to purchase it, Verdi's Requiem also being my favourite choral work. Under Mehta's baton, the Coro della Fondazione Arturo Toscanini and the Orchestra Filarmonica Arturo Toscanini perform passionately throughout. D'Intino (mezzo), Vargas (tenor) and Siwek (bass) are in really fine voice, but the wobbly decibels of Cedolins (soprano) spoil the whole performance, not to mention her inability to sustain even the shortest of phrases, as well as poor projection (she sings with a half-open mouth). As if this weren't enough, an insensitive member of the audience begins applauding before the conductor has lowered his hands: silence follows, then applause."
4,Great Manga,"First of all I dont see why everyone is complaing about how the manga leaves out a lot from the show-when actually its the show that added things.This manga did not come to be by the film to paper method,but rather the series came to be by paper to film. This said I feel the only real downfalls of the book are the sounds as stated previously, and the fact that you have to know quite a bit about gundam wing are you might not understand much. Great art and dialoge. Deffinatly a four out of five"
5,One volume or two?,My Harper Torchbooks edition came in 2 vols. in the 1962 First Edition. Just so you are aware that this may be so if you buy this particular edition.
5,Great,"One of the best punk cds ever. Even if you don't like punk rock you will like this cd. Best song on here is Kate is Great, and it is great. EAST COAST PUNK ROCKS"
3,one of my best cd's,"THIS IS ONE OF MY BEST CD'S, AND YOU NEED TO HAVE IT. THERE IS NOT A BAD SONG ON IT. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 3 STARS IS BECAUSE I HATE SOCCER, AND THE PICTURE ON THE CD IS A SOCCER BALL. OTHERWISE GREAT CD"
4,The C.D is Okay and is pretty good,even though it wasn't better than MY WAy I still love the whole C.d espically nice&slow withe twista and B-rock
2,I should have kept my money,"The music is okay. I do like Bedtime and Nice & Slow. But, I got sick of hearing Usher yell ""ladies..."" every 15 seconds. Give me a break."
3,Good But Far From His Best,"Usher has taken the world by storm with all of this albums.Personally i think MY WAY was this best album yet.8701 was jammmin' too.Live is a good album 4 usher fans but the cd does get boring..If u want a really good Usher album buy My Way or 8701.This album could've been better, however i'm not sorry i got it because some songs do sound nice in the Live version especially Nice and Slow.- Dat song Rockz!!"
2,USHER HAS DONE BETTER,"I LOVE R&B AND RAP. LIVE HAS TOO MUCH....ROCK & ROLL SOUND. IT AIN'T THE GOOD MUSIC IT WS IN MY WAY. (AND IF USHER HAPPENS TO READ THIS, I THINK YOU SHOULD GO BACK TOO YOUR OLD STLYE. OTHERWISE, IWANT MY MONEY BACK. BUT MY CD STORE DON'T TAKE REFUNDS. TSK TSK TSK USHER. I'M DISSAPIONTED.)"
1,Roll up,Works fine for small puzzles but not well for rarge puzzleswill not work on a 24 X 36 inch PuzzleNot what I hoped forBUT it was NOT a rip off
1,"Not really usefull, save your money.","For me, just pice of green cloth, you probably can see them in ""christmas items"". Do not mean any thing to hlep me solve my problem. I know it is cheap, and depends on other reviwers describs it ""sounds"" good. Don't waste your money in here, find some where else."
2,not bad but shipped almost expired,"I got 64 little packets that expired in 2 days after I got them. They still tasted ok but what a disappointment in Amazon. You'd think they track this stuff better with food. I didn't bother returning it, though I should have."
1,Crappy product,"This is another bad bag of candy. Stale, clumped sugar, too much sugar, tasted flat and old. Even the bag was cheap. Do not buy!!!"
5,Calm in My Chaos,"A wonderful book for all mothers of young children! Calm in My Choas is full of wonderful short stories that every mom will relate to. They will make you laugh and cry. I love the Personal Touch section after each story which will challenges me to take a look at the blessings around me instead of always focusing on my ""to-do"" list. It makes a great gift for friends. A book you can read over and over again."
3,Needed more cohesion,"I liked the concept of this book, but for me, it just did not go far enough. The chapters are far too short, and at the end of each chapter I was left wanting more. More depth, more discussion, more something. What was there was great, the writing is honest and open. However, the book did not flow to me and felt more like a bunch of disjointed journal entries that were too short to drive home their point. This book to me felt like a good start. There is plenty of encouragement in small doses here and there. So I liked what was there to read, but wished it was deeper and more cohesive."
5,Calm in My Chaos,The book begins with a journal countdown to her child's birth. Every chapter begins with a scripture then she shares her experiences as a mother and wife and ends with a prayer. Her experiences and thoughts about them make you feel as if you're reading about yourself. Nice book with good advice and appropriate scriptural references for direction.
2,not for me,"I am a stay at home mom to two small children, and I was looking for a book to make me smile when things get stressful. This book is fine if you are a deeply religious person -- but if you are not, you will find it talks more about Jesus than it does about the stresses of raising children. I believe in God and am a good Catholic girl...but half way through the book, it's like ""okay, I get it..you pray to God a lot and yeah for you! Now can you discuss raising children a little?""Sorry - I just don't understand the deep level of belief the writer has, I guess...."
3,The Quest For Ravonna,"The central theme in these issues is Kang's quest to ressurect Ravonna who was killed way back in Avengers #24. This collection includes Thor 140, Hulk 135, Avengers 69-71 and 267-269. I think that this collection would have been better served to drop the Thor and Hulk issues(which have nothing to do with the main theme other than the Growing Man being introduced in the Thor issue) and adding Avengers 23-24 for continuity sake. You would have the introduction and death of Ravonna and then Kang's attempt to get her back. Avengers 69-71 deals with Kang's contest with the Gamemaster and then Avengers 267-269 deals with one Kang's quest to be the only Kang so that he can have a very much alive Ravonna to himself."
2,Change Monsters,"Another catchy title, full of stories, a loose list of variables and an ad for our services; how novel! Good light reading, no coherent actionable solution. Didn't we already know that there is anxiety, resistance, a need to align and support?"
2,"Good start, Poor End","First, this book lists all the author's successes in great detail, but wants to only provide wooly and rather meaningless references to her failures or those clients who are hopeless. Where is the point in that - how can we learn from faults and her insights on poor strategies that we cannot cross reference to our own experience of these firms.Second, the first 40 or so pages are good - stagnation area is very good - but the rest is her successes without much value being added to the reader looking for wisdom."
5,Great book and easy to read,This book is great! It is easy to read and understand. It really helps you with the changes you might need to make in your organization and figure out why people act the way they do. This will prepare you for these reactions and how to handle them.
2,"Long on Stories, Short on Content","As an internal consultant to a Fortune 500, part of my job is to assist with change management efforts. Thus, I was excited to see this new title on such a pertinent element of the change process. My anticipation was quickly replaced with disappointment as the book is long on stories but short on content. Aside from expanding Lewin's change model with before and after processes, the author does little to guide the reader in understanding the dynamics of change. Her tactics for dealing with change are so covered in war-stories that they are difficult to find. In all, a disappointment for both the experienced and novice reader of change management processes."
5,The master lyricist made great without the lyrics,"I want to thank my friend Scott Hardin (""Goob"") for turning me on to this CD. This will be my first Bluegrass CD, but it won't be my last."
3,dead ringer,"ok, don't get me wrong, I LOVE Clandestino, play it, sing it, can't imagine the world without it bla bla bla. So the day Esperanza comes out I go buy it without bothering to listen to it. That's what real fans do. Well, I like it, but it sounds ""rechauffe"" as we say in french, or ""reheated"" or ""recalentado"". It sounds THE SAME as Clandestino. Which is fine. But I don't think I'll get #3 so eagerly."
2,Disappointing,"Sadly this is not a good album. I was looking forward to it after listening to ""Clandestino"". Some of the songs are good, but it's far from the quality of his previous work. Also, he remixes some of his old songs and calls them something else in this album, that really kills the mood. I want to listen to new songs not remakes of the same old songs. The other thing that got to my nerves, was the quantity of sound clips from TV and Radio added to the songs, that's old too. He tried it in Clandestino and it somehow blended well with the album but in this album it seems annoying. I'm very disappointed; this album could have been great, yet it's far from it."
5,A Must!,"My favorite album of all time from the most important artist of our time. Manu Chao's contributions can be likened to greats like Woodie Guthrie, Bob Dylan, and Bob Marley with a global perspective. This intoxicating collection provokes and delights providing the first great folk anthem of the century. If you don't know this artist, get to know him"
3,Pfff,"I think this cd is very similar to ""clandestino"" me being a huge fan of manu chao i don't think this cd was made with a lot of work ...i would rather recomend his clandestino cd which is the best...the 2 cd's are very similar but in a way it's like a sequel very few sequels are worth watching.."
5,MANU CHAO-INTERNATIONAL DIASPORA,"In America we often seem to miss the best of international music, focusing instead on our own muscial genres, pop, R&B, rock, and jazz. It was a pleasure then to learn of Manu Chao in Barcelona, and to be present when he made an appearance there in September.In Proxima Estacion Esperanza, this international funk beat combines the best of the peoples of the diaspora, (Africa), with the authentic spanish and Afri-French sounds. A successful combination especially when you throw in a bit of reggae.I hope that here in America we can become more exposed to music which combines the best of all cultures... Espero por mas Manu Cha!"
3,"Clone of ""Clandestino""","Manu Chao looks like the bright schoolboy who hasn't done hishomework and improvises it quickly just before the class starts.That's more or less the impression I get after listening tothis album. The result is OK but you feel it could've beensomewhat better.I find a bit annoying the nerve he shows recyclingthe rithmic base of one of the previous album's song not only forone but for two of this album's songs. The whole album lookspoorer than ""Clandestino"", though there are undoubtlygood songs. Unless you can't get enough of Manu Chao, you shouldforget about this album and buy ""Clandestino"", which is reallya good buy."
5,beautiful soul,"this is the definition of uplifting! it's music to warm your soul and is the first true advance in music for years. we've been wallowing in silly electronic pop for so long without noticing that the world's languages, cultures and politics are all mixing up more and more. what was needed was someone to sum that up in a joyful uplifting album, that doesn't ignore the seriousness of what's going on around the globe (so the wonderful love song me gustas tu is followed shortly afterwards by denia and its look at algeria's woes). manu chao not only does all this but spoils us with his multilinguism and his playful use of sound bites and backup musicians, while each song flows into the next like a radio show. there's so much to listen to, think about and move to that your mind and body come alive. can't wait for his next."
2,Gets tired after a short while...,"Cute and catchy when you first hear it, but it's really repetative. Bored with it after a week. C'est vrai, c'est du rechauffe."
4,Manu Chao: A single guy singing in many lenguages!!!!,"Clandestino was a great album, but Próxima Estación: Esperanza is better than. The single that I listen all tha day ""Me gustas tu"", have a lot of different rhytms, including top music from around the world, he also likes to visit ""La Candelaria"", a great neighbor from my beautiful city, Bogotá. The shot from his video with Mano Negra ""Señor Matanza"" was made in La Candelaria with some poor people from ""El Cartucho"". I think that Manu Chao is a simple guy with lot of things to remember, in his composition, performing and singing part."
3,Standard Rankin,Not the best Rankin novel - Sprouts fails to inject enough humour into the proceedings to carry the bog standard plot. Rankin regulars (like myself) will be disappointed.
1,I really wish I could read this wonderful sounding book!,"I have not read this book. Why? Although I ordered it in NOVEMBER 2005, I have yet to receive it! I have written many letters to no avail. However, I read another review for a product sold by Amazon that the purchaser had some problem with, and their problem got resolved when they wrote a bad review. That's all I'm trying to do here, really; simply get my problem resolved."
3,not what I was expecting,"This heater is okay, just not what I was hoping or expecting from the discription that it gave.I don't feel as if the fan blows out enough heat, esp. on high.I wouldn't buy another one, for the price."
4,Decent Heater,"A got this from amazon 3-4 weeks ago and the price already dropped about 10 dollars on it since then, maybe i should have waited? I've had zero problems with the heater, it heats a room rather quickly. The only real issues i have are the low and high settings don't seem much different-same speeds basically- and it'd just be nice to have the fan only button on the remote because from a distance you can't tell immediatley whether you've switched on the heater or fan with the mode button. Nice product nonetheless."
5,Does the job and does it well.,"I don't know why there are so many varying negative reviews for this heater. It heats up my very large room and bathroom with no effort. It is very quiet and does not make any noise while oscillating. The remote control is great to have to turn it on or off when needed from a distance and without having to get out of bed. The air ionizer and filter are nice bonuses but I really cannot tell a difference in air quality, yet. Fan only mode is nice for summer or when you just want air to circulate while purifying the air. AAA Batteries included and the LCD is NOT bright during operation as some users have stated. It goes off quickly after you select your settings. Beeping could be annoying if you have a partner who is trying to sleep. I'm sure if you really wanted too, you could open it up and disconnect the speaker.All in all, best deal for the money. Heater, fan, air purifier, ionizer, remote, ascetic, quiet, small, powerful."
1,Wouldn't even turn on,"We bought this heater in December 2008 to use in an emergency. We had never even taken the unit out of the box until a month ago when our neighbor's furnace went out. We let them borrow our heater and when they plugged it in they got a burnt electrical smell and it wouldn't heat up. We contacted SPT the next day and they told us the unit was out of warranty but a technician would contact us to see if a part could be replaced. We still haven't from a technician despite calling them back two more times. At this point we've given up and purchased a Lasko heater as a replacement, and I won't buy anything made by SPT again."
1,"Noisy heater, sound likes motorcycle","Please Please Please save your money and do not buy this unit, it is a piece of junk and very noisy! I just today get one, the box was damaged and when I plug in the heater, the sound likes a motorcycle!! I had a very bad experience with this brand! I bought 3 heaters and I returned all of them!!!"
3,Ehhh...,This was an ok heater. The room I was in didn't have a heater so I got this. Nice design and its also pretty quiet. Heated up my room quickly but it would never shut off at the heat I set it as. I would put the room to 72 and wake up and my room would be 85+ degrees and the heater would still be going. Very annoying.
1,Only lasted 1 month,"Bought this heater 1 month ago-2/17 and it doesn't work anymore (today is 3/31). Only used it on auto at night for the kid's bedroom. And Amazon.com says it's too late to return it, my window for return expired 3/28. Sadly, it stopped working on the 28th exactly, I just didn't have the time to check on this until today. $87 down the potty."
2,I didn't like it.,"I returned it due to the low-fan speed not working, the fan was always on high speed, even when in low-heat mode. But, I also noticed, when in auto mode, when it came close to the set temp it would switch from high heat to low heat (I noticed by feeling the heat with my hands, as my unit's fan was stuck on high all the time), but it wouldn't cycle off because it didn't reach it's set temp yet, but this made it run alot longer to reach the set temp. If it just stayed in high heat mode until it reaches the set temp then it would cycle off sooner. So, I didn't like the way it worked - plus when it's real cold out, it may never be able to reach the set temp since it goes into low heat mode when it gets close. I think this is a design flaw."
3,LCD problems,When it worked it put out a lot of heat. Not sure the room temperature reading was accurate. LCD went bad after 3 weeks. Bad LCD started after putting the heater on oscillation. LCD should have reset itself after being unplugged but never did. Manufacture is sending a new one without much hassle. 60 day full replacement warranty!
2,not so good,"I have found that the electric fan-heaters in general are a weak option for heating needs even in the temperate climate of the Bay Area California. This model in particular has struggled to do any good for me. The oscillation moves much too slow and the fan is just not powerful enough to blow whatever heat the ceramic may create. It is really only useful in a very small room (say a bathroom or equivalent) when you do not want to heat the WHOLE house. However, it may still take around two or more hours to get a room from 50 to 60 degrees. I would recommend using a parabolic or a more powerful fan model if you are not scared of the increased electric bill that ANY of these little heaters will generate."
1,It broke after one winter,I bought it from All American and it stopped working after one winter.I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this heater.
2,Good Heater !,"very good room heater..plus points : fast heating. Set temperature as per your need. remote. ionizer. design ( look ). low weight to handle. auto switch off in case fell down.negative points : ? is it too fragile? ( easy to break ) although, i don't have problem so far, but the material looks fragile.causes lots of noise when you live at a quite environment. but i guess, all heater with fan has that problem. and i am used to it, no problem after i sleep.last : ionizer? i don't know if it is functioning, or if it is, what difference does it make?.in short. i recommend buying this heater, if you are buying from a similar kind, unless you find cheaper with same quality.update: fan died with no use for months,, lifespan : <2 years."
2,Not a long-lasting product,"I agree with many reviewers that this heater is good-looking, quiet, and heats a room quickly. But after 4 months of use, the display will sometimes go ""haywire"", the machine will sometimes make a horrible, loud noise that will not stop until the machine has been turned off for many hours, and sometimes I have to press the ""ON"" button many times in order to work. Although I have used this heater almost every night, I am very gentle with the machine and don't even use the oscillating feature. I do not recommend this product. Although it hasn't completely broken yet, I am planning on ordering a new one."
1,What a dissappointment!,"This heater worked wonderful when I received it! It made my whole office so warm and toasty, but it only lasted about 2 months. Now you turn it on, and it just emits a smell, but no heat. Wish I hadn't bought it at the end of a season because when it came it was not cold weather yet, and I tried it and was satisfied. Once winter came it only worked about 8 times, as I'm only in my home office on weekends. Don't waste your money."
2,"Well, the heater works...","Ah, what can I say? The heater works but the quality of this item is awful. I suppose you get what you pay for and the units are cheap (yes, ""cheap""), but I do expect something I order to at least meet expectations. I ordered two since they seemed like a good deal. Trouble was, one unit was defective immediately - the master switch didn't work. I fixed it myself, because it was less hassle than sending it back, but the second unit has now started squeaking (a defective bearing) loudly. The unit heats up like I expect, but every time I hit the 'off' switch it resets itself so I have to re-enter the temperature when I turn it back on. The ionizer...? I have no idea if it's working or not... maybe it's ionizing a small area around the unit? Bottom line, these heaters are a big disappointment. I can totally identify with those reviews that have reported significant quality issues with these heaters."
2,"This was great, at first.","This heater worked so well, for two weeks. Now it does not heat. It does not come on. I've tried using the remote and turning it on manually. Nothing.I have tried plugging it into different outlets. Have not had time to call customer service and dread packing it up to send it back."
2,"Worked well, but bright, temp stopped after two months","Pros:VERY Quiet.Heat output is great.Thermostat was good while it worked.Cons:I do not notice any Ionic breeze effect at all.Too bright, even for a kids nightlight.Does not save settings so you have to redo settings after powering off.After two months, the thermostat got stuck at 67 degrees and the heater just kept heating and will not shut off unless powered off. Now I must warranty it."
1,Worked only 3 weeks,"I'm very disappointed with this heater. It did heat fine, but it quit working after only 3 weeks. The quality is poor and it's a waste of money. The remote was very hard to read unless you hold it under a bright light. The heater also gave off an unpleasant odor while it was running. Don't waste your time or money on this unit."
2,Ceramic Heater Good for a short time,The heater makes a humming sound/ just makes a lot of noise. I have to turn the television up at times. The heater worked good for 2 months but then gradually it just isn't warming up my bedroom. You have to be very close to the heater to feel the warmth.
1,Junk - quit in less than two weeks.,I had the SPT SH-1508 Tower for less than two weeks when the fan quit working.
1,Hidlins,"Received this item last January. It worked fine for 4 WEEKS then QUIT. The fan quit. It SLIGHTLY radiates some heat but the smell is questionable so I won't use it. Since I threw out the packaging, I couldn't send it back. What a waste of my hard earned money. Never again with this brand!"
3,didn't meet our needs,"We actually bought two of these heaters, one for each of my kids rooms. their rooms tend to be too warm in the summer and very chilly in the winter. I thought this would be perfect because it has a fan only function as well as the ceramic heater. unfortunately the force in which the fan blows is not enough to cool off a room. I don't know if i'll ever find something that meets both these hot/cold needs but i'm going to keep trying. in the meantime, if i only needed this to warm a room, it would definately be a keeper!! it warms up the room quickly, the oscillating blower is great, and i appreciate the safty features. while i would never leave a heater on in my kids rooms over night, it's a relief to know safety comes first with Sunpentown products."
1,BROKE AFTER 2 MONTHS!!!!,LASTED ONLY 2 MONTHS OF WINTER THEN SUDDENLY BLEW OUT!!! I PAID OVER $90.00 LAST YEAR FOR THIS HEATING UNIT. WHAT A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. I WISH I HAD NOT BEEN FOOLED BY THE GLOWING REVIEWS THIS UNIT HAD WHEN I PURCHASED IT. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR RELIABILITY LOOK ELSEWHERE. SHAME ON SPT FOR MAKING SUCH A LOUSY PRODUCT.
1,Short-lived,"This heater lasted for only one and a half seasons. Towards the middle of the second season of use, the heater fan began making an unusually loud rattling sound and emitting a burning smell. It appears that the heater fan is of poor quality. Sunpentown's warranty lasts only a year, leaving me with no recourse other than to throw good money after bad by mailing the heater to them for paid repairs. $80 for a heater that is so short-lived (and dangerous to boot) is a rip off."
5,SPACE HEATER,This is a great heater. Really enjoy the remote . It is helpful to warm the room before getting out of bed. Delivery time was excellent. Would reccomend this product and delivery service to anyone
1,DO NOT BUY,"Great... when it works.So far I have had mine replaced TWICE. Both times it has died from the same problem. It will be running, then the LCD will just go blue, beep a few times and stop.I can not trust the unit to be on by itself anymore, and I will not buy another SPT product because of their poor service."
1,disappointment :(,"In theory, sounds like a great item...I was really excited to cut down on heating costs and a remote so I wouldn't have to get up in the middle of the night. Turns out the remote only controlled rotation (not power), was noisy (not really helpful while sleeping), and broke after a month of use. I did like the safety feature, of on the bottom if tilted the power would shut off, but otherwise- save your money on a better piece of equipment."
2,a bit dissappointed,"As our system runs on propane we have utilized space heaters over the years to work in unicen in order to save a little on the process and money spent on refilling our propane tank, i decided this year to spend a little more and buy a better or more diverse space heater, the bionaire looked and read to be a decent buy for the qualities, however i feel that saving the money and going with a regular unit for less money, reasons: the unit comes on and off constantly in order to maintain the exact temperature,a bit annoying when trying to rest, cannot change. The high low setting is indistinguishable, and just one month in and the unit seems loose in pivot and makes clatter sounds when shutting down like the fan or motor have bad bearings or setup, as well switches click when coming on and going off unnecessarily noisy. Likes: removable filter for cleaning, ionization, and no bright lights except when programing."
4,heater review,"I purchased 2 of these units for the new sun-rooms we had built onto the back of our house. We were happy with the size of the heaters. However, we were expecting that the units would heat up faster, but they did do the job over time. We like the fact that the units display the temperature in the room. We really like the oscalating feature and the safety cut off feature if it is tipped. We haven't evaluated the ionizer feature yet. For the most part, the units seem to work fine."
3,"Not bad, but a little complicated to use.","We like this heater, but wish it were a bit more powerful, considering how much it cost. Also, the variety of digital displays and options for operating it kind of drives me nuts. I have to look at the manual every time I turn it on. (Usually I just turn it on and take whatever setting I happen to get.:)"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Worked fine for 3 days, then stopped working. Warranty covers returning to manufacturer at your expense and they will repair. Not worth sending back for such a poor quality product."
4,CERAMIC HEATER,"This is exactly what I was looking for. It arrived looking a bit used. It seems that it does uses alot of power and I found the elctrical wires to the wall socket does get very heated. So I suggest supervision when in use, also do not leave it plugged in. It does heat a small room quickly."
4,"Great heater, loud beeps","Pro: This heater is surprisingly effective at heating large rooms.Con: Every time you change a setting, it beeps, and the beeps are *very* loud. This has limited our use of it anywhere near our sleeping baby."
1,Loved it for 8 hours until it broke.,"Setup was very easy and we liked the versatility of being able to use this as a heater or fan, depending on season. This was bought to supplement the radiators in our drafty old duplex.We used it for 4 hours the night we got it and it did a good job of warming our living room and bedroom (we moved it between the two). Same story the next night except at some point after we went to bed it made a loud beep and the screen lit up with a bunch of nonsense. We did the reset procedure and unplugged, but on start up the next night it did the same thing. It's going back to Amazon and we'll be trying a different heater."
4,good heater!,"I love this heater, it puts out heat immediately and warms up small spaces quickly. The best thing about it is that it has a remote, so the second you walk into the room, you can click on the heater, or in the morning when you wake up before you get out of bed. The reason i give it a four is because the function screen is REALLY REALLY bright, and is hard to read if you are looking at in from a different angle than straight on. I reccommend this heater, except for the light it emits !"
3,Doesn't work for me,"The heater warms up the room quickly uniformly. But I was looking for heater with timer so that I can program it to start automatically an hour before my alarm goes off. This unit lacks this feature.Also, it is quite but sometimes it makes a lot of noise when started but noise gradually reduces to acceptable level.I am going to return it tomorrow mostly because of timer thing."
1,Malfunctioning heater,I purchased this heater for my daughter on Febuary 5th. The heater was connected to a surge protector. A week ago my daughter woke up to the smell of something burning. The heater had burned out and the outlet in the surge protector was melted.
3,Question? Can this be used as a fan in the summer too?,I was just wondering if this can be used in the summer as a fan too.
3,heats nicely but trips my circuit breaker!,"This heater works fine to take the chill off of a cold room, and the remote and oscillation are nice features, but I have had it trip a circuit breaker TWICE in the week that I have had it. No, I don't have a really old house... it was built in 1978. The first time, I plugged the vacuum into the same outlet. Ok, so that's a no-no. Not a big deal. After having it running (on high) for several hours plugged into a different outlet, however, it tripped the breaker AGAIN (and I had to go into the freezing cold garage to reset it).I guess if I just needed to run it for an hour or two, it would be great... but there ought to be something to shut the heater off before it trips the whole breaker for my family room and kitchen!"
5,"Quiet, space saving, very nice little heater","This is a great little heater. I am using it to supplement hot water baseboard heat that I want to use less this winter. So far, so good. We had a cold snap here in Mid October and with the boiler thermostat at 60 degrees, this little gem brought it up to 68-70 with no problem in a medium size living room (about 20x15). It might struggle a little at lower temperatures, but I bet it would still do pretty well even at 55 or so. It is SOOOO quiet compared to most space heaters. The small footprint is also why I chose this and it is very unobtrusive. The digital contols bug me, but that is only my personal preference...it is actually easy to use once you get the basics down. Never thought I'd use a remote (thought it was ridiculous, just get OFF your lazy butt!) but as a certified couch potato on occasion, it's sweet! I say its worth the extra money...cheaper ususally means noisier and big and ugly...or too small to effectively heat a good size space."
4,"i agree, it aint no bad religion, but it's up there","bad religion, probably the greatest punk band to ever play the genre. Down by law follows in a more heavy but identical lyrical standpoint. the last of the sharpshooters is just above your average run of the mill punk album. I reccomend No use for a name, garage fuzz, or the new bomb turks if you liked this."
3,its ok,"nothing too special, i heard that this was their ""greatest"" cd to date if so i won't be buying any of their other c.d.'s. Check out Swingin Utters or No Use for a Name for some better stuff."
3,Doesn't Look Right,"This doll looks cheap. Although it's labeled as a Disney product, it looks more like a knock-off. I don't recommend it."
4,worth reading,"Although this is a lot different from what a typical ""scientific mind"" is ready to adhere to, Christel Nani convincingly tells her story."
3,From Happy-Punk to Depress-Punk,"I use to like Pennywise because they're song were powerful and the message was positive. On this album, the music is still good, but the lyrics are so depressing... Buy About Time instead!"
2,Huge Punk Fan!!,"I have been a huge fan of the 90's punk scene and have almost every album from lagwagon, nofx, no use for a name, ten foot pole, strung out, pulley etc. Pennywise was not my favorite band, but I did like ""Unknown Road"" and ""About Time"". I bought this album the day it came out, and at first it sounded good. But after 2 or 3 listens, the songs all started to blend together. I love the energy and musicianship, but the songs mostly sound the same. The choruses all end up with the singer half chanting/half singing the name of the song ie: Fight till you die!!, Your on a date with destiny!!, Society!!.....you get the point! If you listen to each song individually, there is some quality there, but put back to back on one album, they all run together. Needless to say, this was the last PW album I bought, and from what I have heard they didn't get any better. Still a big fan of the genre, but this album is low on my list of good punk albums."
5,wow,"This has to be one of the finest punk albums ever made. I personally am a fan of a lot of punk from bands like sum 41 to bad religion and I must say that Pennywise's cd Full Circle is one of the best albums I have heard. There are no AFI style love emo ballads...this is pure energy from beginning to end and not once to they slip or stumble...Pennywise at its finest...heck, this is punk at its finest."
2,No quality at all!,"It doesn't matter if you're more into ska, punk or anything else going that direction, there are always good bands and bad bands playing that kind of music. To me, Pennywise is making bad punk! If you liked Pennywise's other CD's, you should buy this one, too. If you like ska or punk, you should rather buy a real big fish, less than jake, hippos or even a nofx CD. This at least is my opinion."
1,Horrible!,It was horrible! It sounded as though it was recorded in a bathroom. This had to be their worst CD ever! Get another one pass on this! I was highly dissapointed!
5,ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS 1 OF THE BEST CD'S IVE EVER HEARD IT ABSOULTLY ROCKS!!!!!!!!! THE ONLY THING THAT PW IS 311. IF U LIKE ANY SORT OF PUNK MUSIC LIKE GOLDFINGER GREENDAY LESSTHAN JAKE BLINK182 OR ANY OTHER BAND YOU WILL LIKE THIS ALBUM IT IS A MUST FOR ANY PUNK ROCK LISTENER.
4,"Dramatic, operatic music","I'm always a bit leery of songs that start with sounds like space ships landing or some industrial process because, to me, it seems pretentious. However, having said that, Emma does have a lovely voice and you hear it most often in her upper registers. The arrangements for the most part sound like they could be from a movie soundtrack at the dramatic conclusion of the film. Emma says she's not an opera singer but I would like to hear her perform one or two Puccini arias. Overall, this is good stuff, but you have to be in the right mood."
5,Ruby from New Jersey,"I was in an antique store in Cape May, New Jersey and this beautiful, haunting music was playing in the background. I could not concentrate on my shopping and finally asked the owner of the store to identify the artist. I had never heard of Emma before and could not find the CD anywhere. Finally I tried Amazon and was able to locate it. I have only had the CD for about six weeks and have probably just about worn it out. The combination of the beautiful orchastration, the backround choral and her exquitiste voice is quite a combination. Everyone who has heard the CD loves it and has ordered it for themselves and/or as gifts. I own a small barber/beauty salon and my customers love this CD. Hope Emma does more!!"
5,Spellbinding!,"It is easy to think of Emma Shapplin's passionate music having arisen from the noble shadow of a lost, classical world. Nevertheless, her beautifully artistic voice begs the limits of the descriptive powers of human language. The pleasure of listening to her simply cannot be overstated. One could more easily overstate the beauty of a rose. Moreover, one need not understand Italian or French to appreciate the music...after all, it was not the language of the Sirens that plagued the ship, but the song..."
4,new voice of opera,"When I was young I used to listen to opera. It was not until a year ago when I heard Emma Shapplin that I grew a passion for opera. The single 'Spente Le Stelle' from her album 'Carmine Meo' best describes Emma's music. She takes opera classics and mixes it with pop and techno music to give it modern approach. Sarah Brightman, another opera singer, also mixes pop and opera. But Emma appeals more to the younger listener with her Sarah Brightman meets Moby sound. This girl can hit the high notes better than Sarah. Her sex appeal also adds spice to what was dull opera. Check out this album and you will have a passion for opera."
4,Needs work,"I have to say that I purchased this CD with the hopes of its being as great as the club mixes of Spente le Stelle I've heard. Emma, no doubt on her way to being one of the best pop sopranos, is still in need of polishing that powerful instrument she has. There are many segments in several of the songs that if you have an ear for pitch, just make you cringe. Even though the arrangements are wonderful, including the male Gregorian chant and the sweeping melodies that seem to take flight on their own, the CD could have waited for the right voice to give it the height it deserved. If we're lucky it will be remade and made even more a success."
5,Emma's voice stole my heart,"I was at a Versace store in Dallas, Tx. They were playing the cd, asked the name of the artist and went to look for it.After searching at all the local stores found it one month later.No one knew who she was! Went to Mexico and found that she is well known there! I have recommended her album to all my friends. After listening all the songs you wish it had 30 songs in it. INCREDIBLE"
2,Save your money,"Emma Shapplin no doubt has a beautiful voice, but here's the ""but"". Her stab at combining pop and opera just doesn't cut it. I don't know if it's because her music selections were poor, I am no expert, I just am a HUGE fan of the pop/operatic genre. Her voice and the songs didn't really come together with that powerful dynamic combo that sends chills down the spine. I suggest Sarah Brightman who has pretty much dominated this genre, and also a less well known artist that I love named Laura Turner. I am always searching for new or obscure artists that perform in this category, and when I did discover Emma, I was disappointed. She was anticlimatic from what I was already listenning to. Try these artists instead and don't waste your money on Shapplin."
3,Emma is NO Sarah!,"Emma has an OK voice but it clearly needs to be polished up a bit before anyone can compare her to a true artist like Sarah Brightman. You people need to get your ears checked!""Spente Le Stelle,"" in its club incarnation, is an amazing work of dance music art, which forgives Emma's untrained voice. It is truly a classic dance remix. That said, I look forward to her future efforts."
1,Florin Coter (florin@netvision.net.il),Look folks. Emma has no special voice: not good enough for opera singing nor alive enough for other kinds of music. She takes real gems and transforms them in a lesser something. I got an email from a friend who was astonished by her. I sent her a small gift to let the poor creature listen to A VOICE: Cecilia Bartoli (pick any). The answer came promptly: I understand and have just put Emma's CD in the garbage bin. But!!! I still need to explain why I write and why I gave one star. According to the reactionss I hear around me I have no doubt that her CDs will make many people happier and closer to educated vocal music.The bottom line. This CD is in no way a musical achievement as poor orchestration and poor voice cannot be hidden behind excellent material.
5,"Yes, it does grab your attention","Another reviewer said she heard this CD playing in the background in a shop. I discovered it in a similar way, at breakfast in a guest house in Montreal. After hearing about 10 min. of the music, I HAD to find out what album it was. Bought it that day. That night, we went to see the show ""From Rock to Opera"" at the Casino de Montreal - fabulous show by the way - and the opening number was ""spente le stelle"", track 2 of the CD. Totally blew me away; got goose bumps! One reviewer, who gave her one star, complained that Shapplin's voice was not of a certain operatic quality. Well, if you're looking for pure opera, then look someplace else. If you're looking for a CD that you'll love while you're having a lazy Sunday morning breakfast or soaking in the tub with a fine glass of wine, this is it!"
5,Opera with a twist....,"I heard a remix of ""Spente de Stelle"" on an Internet radio station, and this piqued my interest. I went out and bought Carmine Meo, and I LOVE it. The songs, although they're written in old Italian and sound like classical opera, are completely original and very beautiful. Fans of Sarah Brightman will probably like this album as well (listen to ""Discovering Yourself"" and you'll see why). I can't wait to get my hands on Atylantos, the next album from Jean-Patrick Capdevielle; if it's anything like Carmine Meo, I'm sure I'll love it!"
5,Great reference book.,I use this book in my massage therapy practice. It is an excellent reference guide to keep close at hand.
2,Thinnest syrup ever,"I agree with the other 2 reviews that state this product is not syrup. In fact, it's thinner in consistency than the regular KAL liquid stevia. I came across this ""syrup"" offering and decided to try it because it's a better buy at 16 oz for $7.34. However, since more is needed, it doesn't end up being a better buy at all. As good as the regular KAL liquid stevia is, which I give 5 stars, this product is just poor."
2,Not Syrup at all,This product is more like a sweet water not at all like syrup. I still use it but it takes much more to get enough sweetness out of it.I thought I was going to be able to use this with fruit but it didn't work out the way I planned.
2,Not syrup,"When I think of ""syrup"" I think of a thick consistency. This stuff is basically stevia and water... not sure why I paid so much for it."
4,Good Introduction,"This, Portraits of the Nations compilation was a good introduction to the people and places of Scotland. The author provides pertinent historical and relevant socio/political data for the time of writing, around 1990.An updated selection will probably serve the reader better, but this is a solid tool in building understanding for Scotland!"
4,Buena ayuda,"Es una ventaja contar con este libro en español, es una buena ayuda espiritual para todos, no solo para los enfermos de cáncer."
4,Mixed Review,"For the ladies this is a movie laden with eye candy. I did enjoy it, again and again. My boyfriend however tore it apart, as he was in the military and noted all the holes in what actually could and would happen."
2,Outdated information,"I made the mistake of purchasing his older book called The A.R.T. of making babies updated edition. Do not buy unless your doing a research paper. This book was written in 1998 and the information is outdated. Make sure you purchase the 2005 edition. I wish amazon.com would have made this clearer. I did read it anyways and had the book been filled with updated information it could be informative. I found the ""Couple's guide to In Vitro Fertilization a much better book. Having recently gone through the procedure it was right on the money and very easy to read and understand."
2,Disappointed Diva,"Ordered the Straubing's in black, brown and taupe. Quality of the leather in both the black and brown seemed sub-par. Almost looked plastic, I would recommended getting the boots in stone if you must. As for comfort, they were fine however these boots are narrow. I order the 6 W -- the boot was a little snug when I zipped it up - but no more than 6 steps the zipper split and the boot was stuck on my foot. I have a friend who purchase the same boots and was pleasantly suprised at how narrow the boot was - good luck."
3,Had a lot of trouble with the amps,Bought this for my five year old for Christmas. The amp didn't work so the company promptly sent a replacement. Ten months later the replacement amp no longer works! The guitar seems fine. It looks good and it works.
5,Tour de force,"Kaplan's book is a tour de force. Bridging philosophy, history and, oh yes, mathematics, he takes us through a romp of human intellectual history. He makes the argument, that zero, like death, is at the base of a culture's understanding of the world. At the beginning of the book's journey, such a claim would seem outlandish, but by the end, we have returned home throughly convinced and pleased to have made the trip. It is a pleasure to read a creative mind at play."
2,A good primer for aspiring writers on how not to write a book,"I bought this book not expecting it to be such a difficult read. I thought it was about the history of zero; once I started reading, I found out the book was about...well...I have no idea! I wasn't able to finish the book and I stopped about half-way. His writing style is too abstruse, and just arrant nonsence. By the time I got to the middle, I still didn't know where zero came from nor did I care.Here is an example of his writing:""Any five-year-old will tell you that negative numbers aren't numbers at all, and phylogeny recapitulated ontogeny in taking its time to recognize negatives."""
1,A Big Zero,"I abandoned this book after only 50 pages, driven away by the author's relentlessly florid writing style (random sample: ""It is tempting to borrow some of this linear imagery and say that, like Goethe's Faust, zero came through its dark struggles by cleaving to the one true way. But history walks on human feet."") This book is my nominee for the year's Purple Prose Prize."
1,Its more fiction than history,"A disappointing book. Like many Eurocentric historians who simply have to credit the Greeks with every great invention, regardless if they really are responsible for it or not, this book appears to have been written with an agenda of stealing the discovery (or invention)of Zero away from Indians and somehow thrust it on the Greeks. It appears that the author has worked a great deal more on his conclusions than his arguments. He gives no reliable references from the experts in the field to support the argument and mostly overlooks those who oppose his view. The book does not even care to give a bibliography which is required in any serious research document. Not worth the price if you are looking for an authentic work on the history of zero."
5,A Surprising Find,"Not much to say about this book except that, once I read it, my whole view of life was changed. Don't read it if all you're interested in is the history of a number. But, if you like philosophy commingled with facts, I recommend it highly.My favourite passage, which I quote every chance I get, is: 'We turn over this seeming nonsense with a kind of reflective zest, savoring the difference between what it says and what it means.'Applying that single idea to everything I read and see, I've been able to improve my understanding of literature (I have a degree in English), art, math and business. I read it when it first came out, and it sticks with me to this day.An excellent book."
1,pompous bombastic blather,"I too was excited to read this book after I read several reviews and heard about it again on NPR. However, the book is unreadable. It is inartful, pompous, bombastic, and condescending in tone. There is little or no logical structure in the strictest sense. Chapters seem to be organized around a principle of free association with in the general subject. The reader is burdened with inapposite references, name dropping and a host of howl provoking rudimentary errors of style. The true purpose is not to inform the reader about anything, but to convince the unfortunate of the erudition of the author. In that sense the title is apt: this book is the nothing that is."
3,Obscure references galore,"Some books are meant for company, while others are meant for information, pure and simple. This author is like having a crazy professor over for dinner, with obscure references (non-sequiter?) galore. Have you ever met someone who all of a sudden brings in a movie reference out of nowhere? Or perhaps a friend who is always starting paragraphs in the middle? Robert Kaplan is that kind of company. He's smart. He'd like you to realize that he's smart. We want to know what he knows. But, my God, does he come out of left-field sometimes!For the record, I have a BA in Math."
4,"A scholarly book, important subject, could have been better.","""The Nothing That Is"" is a very interesting and compelling book. This is a subject that few would consider an important topic, but the author brings life to an absolutely fundamental concept in our lives; the concept of zero.However, those of us who are, perhaps, not as prepared as Mr. Kaplan would like us to be to understand the literary devices that he alludes to, would, none the less, enjoy his understanding of this matter in a more colloquial forum, as it were, if you get my drift.WRP"
1,utter useless book ...criminal waste of time ..,"Tries to find out something which is not there. If contravery is what author wanted then, he has succeded. But whole concept looks like another fruitless conspiracy theory of proving western supremecy."
3,philosophical,The book goes into deep details about the history of zero but he also adds too much of philosophy behind zero which is not necessary. In fact I think the author writes more about philosophy than the history of zero it self. The book contains terms you won't understand and you really need the dictionary to understand some things.
5,A wonderful story telling a details of Joans life,this is the most inspiring book i have ever read. It told about Joan's religous life and human life. This book I recomend to everybody above 15.
2,Nothing new,"If you have read Richard Lamb's book, Mussolini as Diplomat, then there's no point of buying this book as it essentialy covers the same ground, and comes to the same conclusions. What's more, even if the former is a dry, boring read, it's still a bargain at $5 for a hardcover."
5,,"4 young women, all at crossroads with who they are, their families and trying to define what their heritage is and means to them. The 4 main characters are all related, from a family that is now scattered between the US and the middle east. This book explores the difficulties in finding one's identity when the worlds you know are so extremely different. Family pressure, expectations, personalities all play a role in how the girls deal with their heritage and their future. It evokes the middle east beautifully and presents the difficulties of having to chose / conciliating two cultures."
4,a pleasure,"A very interesting and fast read. The story of four young Arab women and the different worlds and choices which confront them. The women are all cousins---two are American; one flits between the US and Jordan and the fourth lives in Jordan.There are no simple stereotypes or answers in this book. In fact, the stories involving Khadija and Hala are never fully resolved---you are left dangling which is okay and very realistic.This is a really quick read---you can read it in an evening. I strongly recommend it!"
3,Good book for C++ programmers,"It's a good book for people who is working in Computer Vision with C++ language. There are explanations of some algorithms and their respective implementation in C++, so it's very helpful. Furthermore, after each topic there is a bibliography list about this topic, which is better than have all bibiography in the last part of the book.The only drawback is that the quality of the book is not good. The pages are very easy to tear."
4,s20 is fantastic,"I have had mine for months now. I love it. Good photos withnice colors. I bought the 256meg memory add-on for lots ofquality photos.The only thing I dont like is dark foreground when the background is very bright, other than thats it was one of thebest decisions for me."
5,This is the digital camera for you! No need to shop around!,"After much consideration, we purchased the Canon Powershot S20 because of it's outstanding picture quality, good price, and size. We have been extremely satisfied - so much so that we bought a second one!Highlights: 1) Great picture quality! 3.3 megapixel pictures are good enough for printing on 8x10. 2) Small and portable! The camera is small, especially compared to other digital cameras, so it can be carried in your coat pocket, shirt pocket, or even your pants pocket (although it bulges a bit). 3) Amazon's included 32 megabyte card is a GREAT value - we paid over fifty dollars for a separate 32 megabyte card! This card lets you shoot about 25 more pictures on the top quality setting.You'll be amazed at how great the pictures are and how easily you can carry this camera around!"
3,compatibiluty with windows xp,"I owned this camera for a year. Recently, I'd a serious problem to upgrade it to Windows XP. The USB driver WIA 3.9.1. downloaded from Canon site had 2 problems: 1. It failed to pass XP signature check, 2. It won't work. In addition, my XP doesn't show Canon brand name in the Scanner/Printer/Camera field. I suggest that Canon can provide the customers with a free CD upgrade to XP user with a shipping charge."
3,Good for More Advanced Pole Dancers,"If you're new to pole work, I'd recommend a lower-level pole dance DVD before delving into this one. Lots of great moves and fun to watch but a bit on the ""wow... wish I could do that!"" side. Great to have on hand when you're ready but not for beginners (and definitely not if your pole is a portable/not permanently installed becuase many of the moves are not safe for portable poles)."
1,Pole Kats,"The dvd seemed cheap, looks like it was printed out on a computer and the audio quality is horrendous going from excessively loud to too quiet every few seconds. Some of the tricks are pretty good but you can save yourself the trouble by searching youtube for pole tricks and seeing the same ones."
4,Pole Katz review,"I recently bought a pole about a month ago, and this DVD arrived a week after I got my pole. I had already learned a few basic spins on my own, and this DVD really helped me develop the moves I could do into more complex ones. My one complaint is that on many of the moves they only show the right-handed version, and also the routines at the end are somewhat slow and dull...mostly dancing around the pole and not on it. But overall this DVD was very helpful, it shows moves for beginners as well as difficult moves that I still have yet to accomplish."
2,This book is very large and the up-date is bad and...,"The Campbell's was a good book when it was just 2 volumes, but with 4 volumens it has became a very large and hard to up-date book, it was better when editor was Crenshaw, but with Canale it has became a ""heavy"" book. I personally don't like it for my residents fellows, they buy the Mercer and the Apley's, and for surgical exposures the Hoppenfeld's. It must become a 2 volumes book, getting the 6th ed. as a sample, and maybe Canale will make a ""campbell's yearbook""."
3,"This text must be revised and make it shorter, for better...","Is a good book, but it is 1-very large and editions are very long one to the other. 2- very expensive to be changed as often as desirable. 3- Canale must make a ""Campbell's year book"" as an apendix. Any way is a book every one in orthopaedics need at least for the beginning."
3,Maybe its firts editions where better than now.,"When there was not internet and other media at hand, this was a classical textbook, but now there are more readeable textbooks in orthopaedics, and we can find them in amazon.This is a text for orthopaedics surgeons but is very large to be up-dated as soon as it has to be, and its price makes it a very expensive book for latin american fellows. Could be cheaper...and shorter."
5,Great Bag for traveling!,I used this bag for traveling for work. The size is perfect for a carry on and the pockets and organization on the inside is actually useful. There are 2 side pockets on the outside that fit large water bottles perfectly. The flat bottom is great if you have to carry files and computer.I now use it as a diaper bag....
4,Good book to help get you started.,"It covers different bows and shooting styles. It tells you how to adjust your equipment, how to check for bad arrows, and what it means when your arrows are not flying straight."
3,Simple,Good starting book for anyone interested in beginning archery...but I believe there is better one out there that would simplify from beginner to intermediate in one book...
3,Should have read the comments!,"Just OK, I was looking for a more elementary book for a child who is a total beginner. This has minimal information for that purpose"
2,UN-SEWN CURTAINS,"The curtains were as described. Looked nice as far as the design went. But the craftmanship was awful. Needed 3 valances to go across the window. Two of the three had problems. One was not sewn at the top for the rod pocket to create the ruffled edge at the top. The other one was coming un-sewn in the hem, so i clipped the raveling thread to prevent further raveling and tacked the corner for the quick use as we had to have them immediately. then after the event i had to RE-MAKE these curtains at the machine!!! also purchased a pair of the panels for window on the door....and one of the panels was the same way...the rod pocket was not sewn on one of the panels!!! IF YOU LIKE TO SEW....THIS IS A GREAT PURCHASE!!! They are already cut out for you!!!"
3,Not the best Strange Matter book,"Deadly Delivery sounds good at the beginning, but it gets more boring as it gets on. Then, at the way end, it suddenly takes a turn and becomes sort of exciting. Johnny Barnes is a better author than Marty Engle."
4,Classic Motorhead with the new Metal edge!,"A great compilation of classic Motorhead cuts with some really awesome unsigned bands! Hostile Intent's version of "" Ace of Spades "" blew my ears away! A great combo of undiscovered talent! A must for Motorhead and Metal fans!"
1,"Dead forever? These bands YES, ---Motorhead NO!","Possibly the worst cd I ever purchased. I've been a Motorheadbanger since 1981, and I've never heard such a disgusting ""tribute"" in my life! Some songs don't even have lead guitar! Most songs are for the fans of bands like Death or Boltthrower, but not Motorhead. The only song which I can stand to listen to is Stay Clean, which is done nicely, by a band called Tyrant. Lyrics on the other songs are impossible to make out, imatating the sounds of a barking dog or even a murder being committed. Very little talent, if any, is shown on this cd. Real Motorhead fans, SAVE YOUR MONEY! This cd ""tribute"" shows NO CLASS!"
4,Useful for any starship-based traveller campaign,"This book is helpful in that it not only gives stats for various ships, but also expanded rules for starship design and combat. What I find most interesting, however, are the parts where day to day operation of starships is described."
4,And so it was!,"It's easy to understand, after reading, why Senator Daschle choose to print his account of these extrodinary times. These events did not happen that long ago, yet I found myself remembering things I had forgotten and learning much that was new to me. I found it very interesting to read Daschle's almost hour by hour account of his experience during these historic events. Some may call parts of the book partisan. I think he's simply saying what he truly believes. There is a deep sense of genuiness throughout. You'll like the book!"
4,surprisingly good,"I normally just read fiction, but I liked this book. I'd bought a copy of the book to give to my Dad at Thanksgiving, and hadn't intended on reading it myself. But a six hour delay changing planes in Chicago left me with nothing else to do and I can honestly say that I was shocked at how interesting and readable it was. It was kind of like watching a whole season's worth of the West Wing, only that all this stuff actually happened. A lot of what he talked about I had just barely been aware of at the time, like all the power-sharing stuff, while other sections, like anthrax and 9/11, really opened my eyes to what was really going on. Definately worth reading."
1,Hot Big Mess,Well don't know who is to blame philosophy or Amazon. I bought the 16 oz double rich hot cocoa shower gel and amazon cancelled the order with no explanation as to why?? Did they not have stock?? Was there a price error...what was the reason for cancelling my order??I think from what I have read from others experience in dealing with philosophy's customer service though that they were not greeted in the best customer service way. Someone...Amazon...or philosophy should step up to the plate if they want customers to come back and buy their productsBTW the link in my cancellation notice now takes me to a 2 oz size for 6.00 that is a crazy price for 2 oz of shower gel IMO
5,YUMMY!!!!!,"I love the smell of this stuff, although I would not say it smells like hot choclate. It smells more like choclate cake batter, which is not a bad thing. It reminds me of my mom baking when I was a little girl. The only problem I have with taking wonderful choclate cake batter showers is that it makes me hungry. The shower gel is very conditioning. I don't use extra conditioner on my hair because it is not very dry, yet I do have to on my skin because it is really dry."
4,Very helpful in rehab.,"When I was in rehab, this was such a nice product to have because it could serve as both a shampoo and body wash. The fragrance was a nice mood-booster too. Removed one lippie because it was drying on skin."
5,CHOCOLATE DECADENCE !!,"I love this bodywash, shampoo..it smells like a chocolate heaven when I take a nice hot shower.I thought I would never pay this much for a basic product like a body wash,but I'm hooked on this stuff now!"
2,Chocolate,I loved the Bath and Body Works Wickly Hot Chocolate. They don't seem to make it anymore so thought I would try this instead. It didn't compare. The scent just didn't cut it. The soap is okay but I bought it looking for a good chocolate scent. This didn't provide it. I'm still looking.
1,70+ cancellation e-mails!,"I'm a total loyal Philosophy costumer- I have everything from their purity facewash to hope in the jar and have heard nothing but good things about the company, until now. My order just like everyone else's was cancelled and they then proceeded to send me cancellations one after the other! I got about 30 yesterday and over 40 today!Not good customer service at all!"
1,Crappy Company with Crappy Service,cancelled my order and then sent me THIRTY...yes 30 EMAILS...telling me that they cancelled it.
3,Not much storage,"My daughter has this and since she has gotten it she has never put the top of the tree back on the tree trunk. I am not sure why, it isn't difficult. Maybe she thinks it is a waste of time. It is a cute tree, the trunk has a storage area that stores all the tiny pieces this toy comes with. They put too much stuffing in the tree so there isn't much room to store the extra animals you may have. It gets played with and my daughter loves it but if you are buying it for storage that should not be the reason because it has very little."
4,A good addition.,A broad selection of sea stories -- you have probably already read some of them -- combined as a collection of short stories. An enjoyable addition to an onboard library.
1,A mish mash of good and not so good stories,Seems like the selection proccess of stopries was more what the publisher could get (probably cheap) than a good selection of really good stories. Sure there are some good ones (Like en excerpt from Pete Goss's book) but the continuity in the book totally lacks - and I haven't even finished the book yet after 4 months - and I love sailing books - normally cannot put them down if they are well written.
2,A collection of not so great stories,Some of the stories are interesting but the collection on a whole is disjointed to read and some stories are quite bland.
2,Most Are Not That Great,"There are a few good sea tales by well known authors in this book, but overall, it's a disappointment for those accustomed to adventure stories like O'Brian's Aubrey series, Tristan Jones tales and the like. Some stories end unexpectedly at a point that makes them more like a movie trailer in print. Other stories appear to be the ramblings of sailors who had no specific adventure stories in their hold at all. I found N.C. Wyeth's ""Great Stories of the Sea and Ships"" a far better bang for the buck."
3,Cult of the Illuminated or Sidereals are bastards,"I have mixed feelings about this book. For one, this book gives you a great way of creating a mixed group of exalted. It also gives you a good alternative to creating Solars. That being said, I don't know if I would use the Cult in any fashion other than an antagonist. Players can play Solars with boosted skills and background ratings if they want to play lapdogs to the same people that had them assasinated. My players would rather die than have their Solars become slaves to this Cult."
1,"Almost, but falls short.","This is a Ginger Rogers and Astaire movie that almost could be funny. But somehow it falls short. It chronicles the love stories of two sisters and their sailor boys. One (Ginger) is resentful towards her former tapping partner (Astaire) who always manages to inadverdantly sabotage her career opportunities. The other sister, is the ugly duckling turned into a swan type, who unfortunately, falls in love with a cad of a sailor. So that love story is a very difficult one to be interested in. There are a lot of tap dance numbers. A scene showing Astaire playing the piano. And an especially lovely ballroom routine towards the end with Ginger and Astaire. Fans of the duo will probably like the movie. But it feels long and just not quite funny enough."
4,Follow Those Wonderful Dance Numbers! (3.5 stars),"With Fred/Ginger pairing, I am ready to do something rare - look over the rather uninteresting love story (which has far more screentime than their own) and look forward to the breathtaking dance numbers. And this is nowhere more true than in the 1936 vehicle. Dancing scenes to the music of Irving Berlin are among the best the duo has ever done. ""Let Yourself Go"" sounds throughout the first half of the movie. Later comes Fred crooning ""I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket"" at the crucial point when one starts to be seriously bored. And the final ""Let's Face The Music And Dance"" scene with that gorgeous Ginger's gown and all -- the film is well worth watching for the sake of its very end. An essential viewing for dancers... and others!"
2,didnt work,"thought this was what i wanted but i was wrong couldnt use it , bought myself a printer with cable lines much easier."
1,TERRIBLE,"NOWHERE DOES THIS VIDEO STATE SAMPLER, BY THE 3RD SELECTION YOUR READY TO TEAR YOUR HAIR OUT AS MOST OF THESE GREAT ARTISTS ARE CUT OFF AFTER A LITTLE OVER A MINUTE.."
5,Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah,Excellent condition. This is the first book one should read who is interested in a One World concept of religion.
1,will never order again,ordered purple cardstock to usr for wedding favors never received the product so as a result diappointed many people will never order fprom this site again.
2,Not for me...,"I tried two different segments at 2 different times and both times shut it off after about a minute. The music is bad and distracting. I didn't care for the instructor either, but she wasn't as bad as the music. I didn't get far enough into anything to offer any real feedback on the poses."
1,Not What I Would Call Yoga.....,"This is not what I would call yoga. It has much to much of a workout mentality to it and it does the same poses over and over again. When the instructor modifies poses, there is no one to demonstrate the modifications and some of the transitions between poses seem dangerous to me. I do yoga videos a lot and this is not one I like at all. I will not be doing it again. This has none of the soul of yoga. I much prefer my Crunch Yoga DVD with the two workouts on it."
4,just what you are looking for,my hearing is off so there may have been something said about seeing your DR. first . well I did ended up pulling a muscle.so I am saing it's good just be careful.
2,Much too fast to learn or get a routine and not friendly,"Even with her attempts to ""take time to modify and go at your pace"", she moves too quick too learn and feel comfortable with time in 10 minutes and does not explain as well as could."
5,Yoga Good Stuff,"I found this video very easy to follow and learn Yoga with. Being a first timer at Yoga, I did find it difficult physically starting out. I found I could do more every week. I feel great after I have done a workout with this video. There are five 10 minute parts and I usually do 3 at a time and it is seems just right."
2,Not What I Hoped For...,"I've done other TMS workouts and really enjoyed them, so I thought I'd try yoga. First off, unless you have never, ever done yoga before, Yoga Basics is a throw-away. It's just a series of sun salutations, almost identical to ones you do in the later sections. Yoga Burn was the only truely enjoyable section, although it didn't fully come through on its claim to raise my heartrate. It did you up a bit, but not enough to burn anything. Yoga for Flexibility was fine, TMS is not really known for their stretch routines. In both of the toning workouts I was distracted by the instructor. Lara is clearly a pilates teachers who quickly learned some yoga postures for this video. This does give me hope for her pilates videos at least. Overall, I think that this is a yoga workout for people who don't like yoga."
5,Great series!,"I fell in love with this series when I discovered it on netflix (had to buy it when they took it off). You can really work hard in the span of 10 minutes, and doing 2-3 of these exercises back to back make for a good workout!"
5,Basic yoga poses,"I like this yoga workout, is more of a workout, with pilates moves in the abs part. Very good for yoga beginners, the instructor explain basic poses and the series Sun salutation."
5,Perfect,"I was looking for a ""self-help"" yoga DVD and this is it. It has 5 10-minute sessions focusing on different muscles, including one just for stretching. The instructor is very clear and you can mix and match the 10 minute sessions to get a routine that is tailored for you."
5,Excellent quick workouts,I checked this out from the library several times and ended up using it so much I finally decided to by it. It's a great video and you can mix and match the workouts depending on what you want to do. Great buy !
5,Have grown to love.,"I honestly didn't like this DVD initially. The programs were so fast paced that I had a hard time keeping up. But, now that I have better mastery of the routines, I actually love it. They offer a nice balance of speed and challenge making them effective and efficient. The Yoga Burn segment really gets me energized and I love that you can mix and match the routines for days when more time is available."
2,"Inconsistent, chunky, boring","I love Lara Hudson's pilates DVDs and thought I would try her yoga workout, too. It doesn't work for me - the pace is too slow, the music is awful and the 10 minute segments are uninspiring. The warm-up is okay, the stretching sequence at the end is very disappointing and everything else is so bland I barely remember the sequence after doing the whole DVD three times.The short segments don't really flow one into another very well, so doing the disc from start to finish doesn't leave me with a feeling that I just completed a wholesome full-body workout.Overall, this DVD almost turned me off yoga altogether. I was lucky to find better yoga workouts elsewhere, this DVD however is not a keeper."
3,Good looking; well constructed; a bit pricey,"We're fans of Selecta Spielzeug wooden toys and we have a half dozen in our home. This ""picture chain"" like all Selecta toys is made in Germany. It's painted wooden tiles are very nice looking, but after viewing the contents -- 8 tiles total -- I was left thinking, ""Is that all we get for $20?"" Our child enjoys it, when she plays with it, but many other toys get more of her attention."
2,Out of Date & Microsoft won't Update,"This used to be a great tool.Until Windows 7 came out.I plugged in my Fingerprint Reader, just as I had for previous versions of Windows and was faced with a message from Win 7 that it couldn't find a driver. Strange, I thought, since it was a Microsoft product.I went on to Microsoft's website only to find out that they had rendered their Fingerprint Reader obsolete and would no longer support it or provide any drivers for Windows 7.Very disappointing."
1,No-Go Vista and Windows 7(RC) 64 bit,This device does not and will never work with 64 bit versions of Windows Vista and Windows 7 (tested with 7 RC).Microsoft clearly says on their web site it does not and will never function on their 64 bit versions of Windows.Searching deeper you will find that they offer a refund on your purchase whether full or partial is questionable.The device does work on their 32 bit versions of Windows.
4,Great gadget !!,"I've been after one of these for months as you all know in todays world we have so many usernames and passwords to remember. Most people have system or use the same passwords but then you get to a site that wont except you normal combination ! Well this little device has worked every time for me. Easy installation, one reboot and you are ready to go. Use it to logon to windows (not domain though) and then open up internet explorer and start registering sites. The other major disappointment with this reader is that it doesnt work out of the box with firefox, which is bad as this is what I use most of the time but..... the good news is that there is an extension (plugin) for firefox that lets you use it, its by no means full proof but its a step in the right direction.http://redoneill.free.fr/fingerfox/index_en.php"
1,lattimore43,when I purchase this reader I thought I could use it for my web pages. but when Got the unit there was a warning in the package that said not recommend for use with banking on-line or any web that require high level of sec. also software only works with i.e. browsers some timeplease skip this item.
1,Buyer Beware!,"I'm quite pleased that Amazon allowed me to return this product. It may work for some PC installations, but did not work for any of my 4 computers.1) No software support for Windows Vista, neither 32-bit nor 64-bit. No promise of when or even if it might be available.2) Pretended to work under Windows XP SP2, but I never could register my fingerprints with success. I have used other fingerprint scanners successfully.3) The software supplied does not treat the scanner as a standard security authentication device, useful for securing all sorts of things; instead, it mostly claims to work for logging into Web sites with IE, although some people say it can be used with Firefox if you get an add-in. I couldn't tell about this, as I could not get it to work at all with 2 XP machines.4) I would have rated it as zero stars, not even one, but the Amazon review software would not let me do this.But 5 stars to Amazon for taking it back!"
4,Works pretty well!,"My office purchased this as a gift for one of our VPs. So far, she loves it!I haven't personally used it/interacted with it, but our resident tech-savvy guy says it works pretty well and was easy to set up."
4,"Good product, doesn't work with the screensaver","It is a good product, and work well. You can log in to your Windows session, MSN, Yahoo Msn, Websites, but... not when you get the screensever protected with password, what you have to do is type you password so you can work again."
3,MicroSoft only,Nice concept if it worked with all software. I don't know if its a hardware or software issue. Doesn't matter but this device is a microsoft only product. I have tried the firefox patch but it still doesn't work.
4,takes time to recognise,"i really liked this device, easy install and good performance but i don't know why it takes a minute to act after using the device for some hours and i need restart to get the normal situation!!!"
3,"Pretty cool, but limited to Internet Explorer & Windows XP","This is a very cool little gadget that stores your passwords and retrieves them with your fingerprint. It seems to only work with Internet Explorer, and there were a few sites that I had problems with entering. It does also integrate into the windows operating system, so that you can use it instead of a password when logging onto your computer, if you have it setup that way. The best thing I have found about it is that if you have multiple users on a computer, it associates a fingerprint with that user, and knows who is logging on and will load that profile. So it is pretty good, but it cannot handle all of my passwords for everything, and I still usae KeePass for that."
3,"good hardware, bad software","I tested it in windows vista.It seems to be a good hardware but the software is terribly bad.only Internet explorer is supported, and I can oppen my computer with it quickly.Need to bee updated by microsoft"
2,Not so Good,This product need more focus in quality. Just bought a month ago and work for a day only. Its just simply doesn't turn on after a day used. The only good things is this product was bought through Amazon and they have a great return policy. Have it return and get credit back. Will try another product.
4,Okay--but not for Vista,"Very simple to set up, and easy to learn. It took about fifteen minutes to get the unit up and running. The software seems to work pretty well--I intentionally added a bad password, then tried to figure out how to fix it without the documentation. It took about five minutes.The biggest problems with this unit are: (1) It does not work when waking my computer from sleep mode. (2) The surface of the unit gets dirty pretty quickly and has to be cleaned pretty regularly."
4,Not for use in network environments,"This product is very good for personal PCs, specially when multiple passwords are required at different logging steps (I have already used up the fingers in one hand, each finger for a specified sign-in process). Managing and updating the logons is also very easy.Unfortunately, the sign-in profiles do not operate all the time in systems heavily protected like network systems or terminal servers, and they work erratically for remote email access with Verizon. In all these cases, the old fashioned sing-in process through typing and clicking still needs to be used.Overall, this is a very good product for home-based uses."
3,Average,"Everything was great with the shipping; however, the Microsoft Fingerprint Reader just isn't for me. I used it mainly for Logon in Windows Vista. One of the biggest problems I have is that before I can log on, I have to wait two minutes for the device to turn on. I can't log on since the screen will say ""Please Wait"". Maybe it works better with a faster computer. I ditched it after about two weeks of use."
2,Software is slow to respond and soon becomes a pain to use,"I though this would save me a load of time when I logged in and out of different websites and I'd look cool while doing it. I actually look stupid while I wait for the software to figure out if my finger is correct, then fill in the fields and click the confirmation button."
1,Highly not reccommended,"Microsoft Fingerprint Readerya so all you have to do to get pass this thing is lift a print from some surface with clear tape, scan it, print it, highlight the finger ridges and put it on the reader and your in, you can do it in like 15 minutes."
3,nice,works good but you can't use it for nothing except to log on to your computer. it will not reconize any websites or programs
1,Useless Device,"I am very disappointed with this device. It is just piece of junk. It will not let to see your finger print. I want to analyze different finger prints, but no option. If you buy a printer, it should able to print, but this junk device not gives you any option. The cost of the sdk is about $1000, but I want to develop myself. I wish there was -1 star on this web site."
3,Entry level capability for an entry device,"Microsoft Fingerprint Reader (DG2-00002) this product was developed by Digital Persona web site - http://www.digitalpersona.com/. They won't support the Microsoft labeled device.My experience is that it works approximately 80-85 percent of the time on the first touch, the second touch raises the reliability to 95 percent (once it did not work at all --I had to reset my computer possibly because of other Windows software conflicts, then it worked).In all I believe that the reliability for this inexpensive device is good.The problems are:The passwords you enter in with it are locked - you have no way to access your passwords for future use on another computer or if you reset-up windows (every 6 month for me).The LED lights are always on (allows ready use) but it drains battery life on a notebook computer."
1,Absolutely Useless,"This product basically is used for home users. Things it does well:1. Pretty accurate at reading your finger.2. Easy to install3. Keeps track of passwords for websites (Just what we need :( another password manager)Things it doesn't do:1. If you are a business and want to use this as another authentication to logging in, forget it. Cant login to a domain attached computer.2. Doens't provide any extra security, which you would think it would.3. the LED that is used to read your finger is ALWAYS on and it's pretty annoying. You have to turn it over when you are not using it, especially in a dark environment.For a company that is supposed to be more security aware this product from microsoft is a complete failure."
4,Good but with drawbacks.,"Overall a pretty good product. Very convient if you have a lot of passwords. Only problems I see are that if you have a lot of duplicte passwords, the cite you are trying to get will not take the the duplicate password. Sometimes I have to repeatedly press my finger on the reader to get it to read. This is my second (broke the other one) and if need be I would buy another. There are other ones out there but they are more pricey and they all do about the same job. If you want real security and encrypting you'll have to put out a good bit more than you do for the Microsoft product."
3,"OK, but can't handle password for screensaver","One of the main reasons I bought the reader was to eliminate the constant typing of my password when returning from a screensaver (password protected return).For some reason, the fingerprint reader is ignored for this ""locked computer"" situation. The only way back in that I've found is to type the password.And I've found no support at Microsoft or the software maker.Everything else works fine, though."
1,Failed to Read My Fingerprint 90% of the Time,"I bought this item in May 2008 for $28 and I ended up throwing it away. More often than not, it wouldn't read my fingerprint, so I ended up having to type in my passwords. And yes I had Microsoft Vista.It is now June 2012 and this Microsoft Fingerprint Reader is selling for $129!! What makes this device SOOO expensive? It only works with XP & Vista. It is not compatible with Windows 7, and I assume it won't be compatible with any newer version of Windows. I just can't believe that this device has escalated so much in price in 4 years and 1 month. That price increase far outstrips inflation - by a large number.I have a hard time believing that this is all due to Microsoft corporate greed (if you believe in that sort of thing). So why is it so valuable? I know MANY reviewers like this gadget, but as I've stated, it didn't work for me 90% of the time."
1,IE 6.0 Restricted Product - Crash IE 7.0,"Buyer Beware:Used for over the past year and it workED great with IE 6.0. Now with IE 7.0 and even with new driver from Microsoft, this MFR will crash IE 7.0 and slow down IE 7.0 whether you used WinXP or Vista. Best test site is to use eBay, crash very very often! P.S. It will NOT work with any other Internet browsers. As of today 9/4/07, this product is strictly for used with IE 6.0 period."
3,Didn't get to use it long,"No need to re-state what others have said. The only problem I had is that,unlike some of the other brands, Microsoft uses a soft plastic window to place your finger on. When it gets smudged it won't recognize your fingerprint, and when I tried to clean it with ordinary window cleaner it got soft and sticky and now won't work at all."
1,WARNING ---> ONLY works with Windows XP !!,I read all the reviews I could find and no one mentioned that it only works with Windows XP. Found out the hard (and depressing) way when I went to install the software on my Windows 2000 PC. Can't say how it works and I don't plan on moving to XP just for this.
1,not 64bit vista compatible,I bought one of these only to discover it is NOT vista 64bit compatble. It will only work on vista 32bit...no plans for 64bit support ever. Mine sits in a file cabinet with the useless software. I don't plan to buy any more microsoft branded hardware. They don't stand behind their products.
4,Beware of Firefox,"I was disappointed to find out, if you want to use this with Firefox, the needed software costs as much as the fingerprint reader.(You can get it to remember just 1 url without software)It seems to work just fine with Internet Explorer using the included software."
3,Pretty Cool... if you use internet explorer,"This piece of equipment is very cool to have, if you like your computer toys... I use it to log onto my computer and AIM and a few other things but it DOES NOT work with Mozilla Firefox. IT will only work with internet explorer or crazy browser.. I use firefox. IT works great most of the time. Can be sluggish and also has a hard time reading fingerprints sometimes... Most of the time it works though. I highly reccomend if you use internet explorer. Other than that you are kind of wasting your money."
2,"Doesn't work with IE7, Firefox, or Linux","I have had it for more than a year now. It worked well initially with IE6 and I thought it was the best password manager yet. After upgrading to IE7, it only worked intermittently. I did some research and found that many many others are having similiar issue with the reader in IE7. First of all, I lost all passwords when I upgraded to IE7. Then the reader apparently doesn't work well with IE7's new tabbed browsing. Right now I have to swpie my finger 10-30 times for the reader to recognize my print. Again, sometime it works and sometimes it absolutely would not work. I have the most up to date MS driver. Not sure what the problem is or how to solve it."
1,No support for 64 bit editions of WinXP and Vista,Its hard to imagine that MS does not want to support its own hardware on its next generation OS. $39.99 down the drain!
1,Microsoft Fingerprint Reader from Electronix4Sale supplier,The unit is not accurate at all. It fails from time to time. I have been requesting to return the unit back to the shipper: Electronix4Sale and THEY DO NOT REPLY to me. It seems after they performed the sale they are NOT interested in satisfying their customers. I have sent several mails and no reply and they have NOT established a RETURN POLICY. Becareful.
3,"Works as advertised, nothing spectacular.","Easy install, easy calibration and setup, works as advertised, and for a reasonable price.Can't complain.I was hoping I'd be able to use it to log in to windows but so far that hasn't been possible since the device is totally useless without Internet Explorer being involved. (or firefox with a plug in)"
3,"Very convenient, but potentially dangerous","This is a very convenient device for saving website logins and passwords so you don't have to enter them all. However, if you replace your windows log on with the finger print log on, BEWARE-- it replaces that menu both in regular boot up and in safe mode. Somehow my logon menu got corrupted, and would basically lock the computer up after it booted up. Even after unplugging, even in safe mode, I couldn't log in. Also, I couldn't find a way to boot with another device and edit some ini file or replace something to get windows to default back to the normal login pad. I work in IT, so I'm not the average computer user, and still ran into some ""gotchas"" with the device. I had hoped to boot in with safe mode, uninstall the software, and reinstall it. That was a no go. Even in safe mode, you can't use the old control alt del to get in if its software gets corrupted.It was accurate at scanning my fingerprint and did add conveniences, at a risk."
1,No Firefox or Windows domain support - deceptive MS marketing,"I bought this product on the cool idea that I could log on to any Web site with the use of my fingerprint. It says on the box that this product ""should"" not be used in corporate networks so already I was feeling suspicious, but since the store I bought it from has a good return policy, I chose to try it out. Well, the product simply does not work if your PC a member of a Windows domain (so ""should"" as stated above is misleading). Also, as some other reviewers pointed out, if you don't use Internet Explorer (a smart thing if you care about security), then you can't use this product as it is hard-coded to work with IE making this product useless for non-IE users. This is a cool concept gone sour by stupid / stubborn product compatibility policy and bad software design.If you are comfortable using IE and only intend to use it in a home environment, by all means, otherwise, stay away from this product.Thanks for reading my review.-Charlie"
1,Get Refund,"You will not be able to use this discontinued Microsoft Fingerprint Reader with Vista 64 bit or Windows 7 64 bit Operating Systems now or in the future. If you are using another operating system then those mentioned then you will like this product just as I did before I upgraded to Windows 7 64 bit OS. Microsoft is issuing a full refund for customers with the same issues, all you have to do is call Microsoft Supplemental Parts line (US only) at 1-800-360-7561. You will be asked to provide the unique PID # on the back of the unit and your mailing address so they can issue your refund check. Be aware, PID #'s are unique and will be used to confirm that a refund has not already been issued for your specific unit."
5,Very easy to use! Saves time in remembering various passwords. Recommend!,I bought one for each computer so far. It works very well with no problems encountered. Bought this in mid-2006 and had this for about 6-months with no complaints.
4,Very Nice Tool,Works very good...have not been able to fool it yet. The software could use some tweaking as it is hard to edit sometimes and there is no overall interface that allows you to edit each password (instead you must navigate to the login window and click on the icon - this causes loops sometimes). Otherwise this is invaluable for folks that have alot of log ins.
3,Decent buy,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday, as he easily forgets passwords, but he was never able to get it to work. He was stubborn enough not to look online at the tips to scan your fingerprint, and I think he was also impatient. However it happened to be, though, it sits plugged in but not used. A waste of the money for us."
3,Only as convenient as it is compatible,"Since this device is being marketed as a ""convenience"" product, it needs to take into account the habits of end users. Obviously, the value of this device is to simplify the logins for the dozens of web sites we visit daily. However, how many people use only one browser exclusively? Despite the form factor and price, if this reader isn't compatible with a browser I often use, that pretty much nullifies the ""convenience"" factor for me. Personally, I won't buy a product that makes my life more difficult for the sake of some theoretical ""convenience"" pitch. Microsoft take note: if another company builds a device that's compatible with both IE and Firefox, your product is pretty much obsolete. How hard could it be to improve on this product? I was ready to buy this device until I learned of its shortcomings."
1,Crap,"Only works, sporadically at that, with Microsoft programs. Most of the time will NOT recognize your fingerprint or log-in information. An expensive piece of light and plastic. If you love the headache, glitches and freezes that Microsoft is notorious for providing....add this $50+ to that list! If you work hard for your money, then investigate a competitor's product. This is a piece of garbage. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Good concept,"I think this is a great concept but for laptops it is more of a hassle than it is worth. I think if it were in the key board it would be awesome. If you have a desk top it probably wouldn't get in the way too bad, but for laptop users it is pointless."
1,Useless toy,"This is not a ""goodbye to passwords"" device as it's promoted, it is useful for entering passwords into websites, ONLY. It does not function at all with Firefox, Opera, or any web browser other than Internet Explorer.It will NOT unlock a locked PC, although perplexingly it will log into a logged off one. It will not log into a remote desktop session, so you sysadmins who think this is going to help you do real work, think again.It's for websites only, which makes it largely useless since any modern web browser will save website logins anyway.The reader itself seems to work very well, I didn't find it missing a fingerprint read once while I was trying to find something useful to use it for."
5,Dark Shadows on DVD,DVD - great packaging & great audio/video quality.I've purchased Vol 1 and Vol 2 - will continue to buy until I have the complete set.
1,where is the dvd you never sent it and I paid for it,Where is the dvd. It has been paid for but it has never been received. Terrible service. Send me the DVD or give me my money back/Alex Starnes
3,Barnabas Collins,These are ok but they are all the first run and you see all the mistakes and how they forgot their lines. It starts before Barnabas Collins and helps set the stage but I'm waiting for Barnabas.
5,Phenomenal! An epiphany!,"I saw this series on public television, and couldn't wait until the station took a break so I could order the video. I am a frequent museum-goer and rent the audio guide to every museum show; but no one has ever made paintings come alive as Sister Wendy has."
3,"Great for Events, not so great for Projects","If you are holding an event that needs support, this book has a ton of great information. But, if you are working on an ongoing project, this book offers little help.I'm working on a photography/video project that takes me all over the United States and I was hoping to find suggestions on how to get sponsors to support my travels (through advertising on my vehicles and website, and through product demonstrations, endorsements, etc.). This book does have a few tips that I can use (hence the 3-star review), but, unfortunately, a lot of the information just doesn't apply outside of Special Events."
4,Sponsorship Seeker's Toolkit Third Edition,"It is a very good book on sponsorship. A must read for all before entering into sponsorship. However, it is written in an Australian dialec, in which you will have to translate into your country."
5,WOW,"I've read nearly a dozen books on the business of sponsorship, and this ranks near the top. It's full of useful information. The book helped me see some things in a new light. For beginning sponsor seekers, this book is worth it's weight in gold. I hope my competition doesn't get their hands on it."
5,Under the Samurai Sword,"C M Graham wrote about his experience when Battan was surrendered to the japs and his experience as a POW in the camps and in the mines as a laborer. Mr Graham is living in Oregon. His book was published by himself. Contact him at 12577 South New Era Road, Oregon City, OR 97045. Mr Graham is a decorated US Soldier.Another book that deals with the surrender and the POW camps from the perspective of a non combatant military physician who was a POW from the surrender to the liberation by US forces under MacArthur. ""Tell MacArthur to Wait"", ISBN 0-8062-3124-6, is the personal experience of Dr Ralph Hibbs who was at some of the same camps as Mr Graham.I recommend both of these books to you. They are well written and hard to put down."
5,Greatest Product Ever,"I purchased this product because it contains whey. I had a recurring episode of bacteria vaginosis (bv). Antibiotics did not help. In fact,the antibiotics only made it worse because it killed both the good and bad bacteria. I read on a woman's forum that Molkosan was very effective in curing this annoying problem because it contained whey. I ordered the product and used it for three or four days. The bv was gone and has not returned. I am trying to get this message out to women all over the world who are suffering from this problem. Molkosan works and I am so glad that I found this product and it permanently cured the bv."
5,Molkosan as a universal cure,"Even though Molkosan is promoted as a nutritional product we have used it for years aganist all kinds of internal bacterial infections like sore throat and stomach upsets and external skin infections, wounds, cuts etc. It is an extremely effective cleaning agent, probably due its high concentration of lactobaccili."
5,they work,"correct item worked beautifully and will recommend to anyone who are looking for shocks for a Nissan sentra, and do be worried they fit"
3,HOME SAFETY MOTION DETECTOR,"The GE SMARTHOME Sensor is OK for general home use. Its distance/range,with a new battery is less than 20 feet ( 6 meters). The angle of sensing is also less than published - and most any object blocks it--lamps, to chair tops. Best to have up high and pointed down--if that is possible. For our home I needed three such units to cover front/back doors ways, and the celler door. Number the alarm key so you know which one shuts off which alarm."
2,Alarm Chirps 30 seconds AFTER motion is detected,"Ok, the beef i have with this alarm is the following. It Chirps once THEN the siren goes off 30 seconds AFTER motion is detected. Take out a watch.....30 seconds it a long time to wait after motion is detected.Plus as someone mentioned it gives away the position of the device with the initial Chirp. I don't know why they do not just have it go off when motion is detected to begin with."
3,It's a good alarm but sucks the batteries,the delay problem is not an issue - just set it off once and the next time there won't be a delay. the problem with this unit is it only operates on batteries and it will only last a couple of days if your alarm goes off (pets set it off). all in all it still is pretty useful but not a 5 star product. If you could plug it in it would be 4 or 5 stars. the alarm is definitely loud so it does the trick.
3,Great For Kids,I bought this unit due to my 4 year old outgrowing the child security features I had installed back when she was a toddler. Since she has ruined quite a couple items in our fridge a 20 dollar investment to alert us when she gets up early is not too bad. For home security I would buy a different motion detector. This one alerts you to its position with a blinking red LED and sounds a warning beep when you get close.
2,THIS COULD BE REPLACED WITH A BELL!,"As others have already said, I don't know what GE was thinking when they designed this device. It has an operating range of only 20 feet, but has a 30 second delay! That means any intruder has a full 30 seconds to cross the short effective range of the alarm before it alarms! Even at a rate of one foot per second that still leaves a full 10 seconds before it alarms. A human being has to crawl to move that slow and I doubt any intruder will be crawling. As an alarm it's a joke, as an entry door chime, it's OK. However, for about half the price you can get a brass merchant's bell on a nice ""s"" spring and mount it to your door. It will look a lot nicer too! Don't waste your money on this. I'm sorry I did."
2,Too loud on arm/disarm and chime,"If this unit had an extra setting to allow for silent arming and disarming + a volume adjustment on the chime mode, it would be an acceptable device for indoor use. Returned to vendor..."
1,USELESS,"Just got broken into yesterday, fortunately, they were in and out fast , not much taken...........so, figured this product would prevent future thefts in my home.........NO WAY............it detects ok, BUT, it BEEPS = WARNS the intruder to just go smash the flashing red light object on the wall!!!!!!!!! ..LOL>............then 30 SECONDs later, the alarm................I mean, what the heck...i want the alarm to go off immediately...............I am taking this back to walmart..............what a waste of time and money........i can see NO use for this product."
2,Very poor product,"This alarm functions as stated in the instruction book (inside the package), but is severely useless. There is actually a 30 second delay before the alarm sounds once motion is detected. To make matters worse, once motion is detected, there is a brief (1/4sec) chirp and a flashing red light that gives away the position of the device. So...effectively, if an intruder can take out the batteries (or stuff it under a pillow) in 30 seconds, your security system is compromised. What were they thinking when they made this? The door chime mode is useful (chimes immediately), but the alarm is not."
2,Too long of a delay,"I thank C. Perez for pointing out the length of delay. 30 seconds is way too much, if an intruder gets in while I sleep he/she could get to me before the alarm even sounds. I want an alarm that goes of instantaneously -- it has a remote so there's no need for a delay. I had bought this at WM, will return it unopened."
3,Work around available...for the price worth it.,"I bought this alarm because one of my dogs insists on using one area of the garage as a bathroom...hard to catch him at it so hard to train. I bought this because it seemed like exactly what was needed to scare him away from the area. In actuality, a dog, can do plenty of business in 30 seconds. Worthless, not entirely. Another review hinted that if the alarm was tripped once (30 seconds of noisy hell) but then would not give the 30 second warning when re-tripped. This works. So as a practice, I arm it, set it off and then leave it...immediate alarm upon next detection. Interesting approach when using it as a burglar alarm (not fun to subject yourself to right before bed) but it will work and for the money, meh, not so bad."
4,Great little product,"Easy to install. Works great. And the 30-second delay before the alarm sounds is typical of more-expensive systems -- and a good thing, giving you time to exit the area once you've armed the unit or to find the ""Disarm"" button if you've accidentally tripped the sensor."
2,Too Loud!,"If you're looking for a loud unit, this is fine. I wanted to use it to notify me when my kids sleep walk, and it doesn't have enough options to turn down the volume."
4,Simple Protection,"If you are looking for a budget security system, this is really the one for you. The siren is too loud for such a small device.The only default is that when you enter the perimeter, it will give you a beep alert with a flashing light (Easy to detect by a burgular) for a 40 seconds till you de-activate it (The burgular can just break it). If the timer of the alert was 20 seconds which I think should be enough for you to enter and de-activate and not enough time for the burgular to think. It could be used only if you are living alone since it comes with one remote. I think it will be best used in your shop if you own one."
3,"""Something in the Water""","Apparently, this is a translation of Charlotte MacLeod's Peter Shandy novel, ""SOMETHING IN THE WATER"", which was a fun read (if at times a bit too cutesy, even for me -- and I happened to enjoy ""CURSE OF THE GIANT HOGWEED"", so . . . !), though it felt like a bit of a sidetrack from the usual cast of characters at Balaclava Agricultural College."
5,Yes! It works!,"I have been using this cream daily for about six weeks. I am a 63 year old woman. My skin wasn't particularly bad, but I noticed that it felt rough when I ran my hand over my cheeks. After using this product for 6 weeks, my skin is now silky smooth! (Actually, I've been meaning to write this review for some time, so I'd say I began to notice the difference about 3-4 wks after I began to use this.)Yes, the cream is orange. Don't worry, it goes on clear and you can't see it at all. Nor does it come off on your pillow. It is so non-greasy I actually use it under my make-up. After 6 weeks of daily use I have used about 1/4 of the jar.You won't find me writing reviews of skin-care products often but I want others to know this actually works. My skin looks better, smoother and more taut.I will be re-ordering this product."
2,not a fan,way too thick. and leaves an orange residue on face. not a high quality product. their hyaloronic night cream is way better
2,Save your money!,I don't know about those two rave reviews - do NOT expect anything magical to happen with this cream. At least that's been my experience. It's nothing special for the price.
3,Excellent quality but seriously overpriced.,"20 bucks for a sink strainer that fits? You gotta be kidding me. All of the cheaper alternatives don't quite fit, but this item is 10 dollars higher than it deserves to be."
1,WAY over priced and ..... Broken,"Just like the others that have posted: The Stem collar broke where it meets the basket. This was bought less than 1 yr, and we hardly use the ""stop"" function of the strainer. I'm angry and I can't believe how much they charge for just the basket! I purposely bought this thinking it was of a higher quality. Kohler needs to come clean on this and own up to the fact that it is a poor design or not made up to the standard for this price. I will be contacting them for a replacement...."
2,Same problem as others with o-ring,"While these strainers look very nice, the function is reliant on a plastic o-ring to seal the drain. After just a couple uses it came off and does hold water any longer."
5,A great read--makes Japanese history come to life.,"Revealing, personal account of a woman's life in prewar Japan"
3,OK BH introductory grammar,"I have used both this grammar and Lambdin's. This grammar is better organized, however it is very challenging for students, because the paradigms come fast and furious. It also introduces a smaller vocabulary that is only relevant in translating narrative text.A warning to those doing self-study: this is not useful for self study. Not enough explanation is given for certain grammatical features in BH."
4,Sipix A6 Sheets Are Better Than A6 Roll,"I carry the Sipix A6 printer -- and a box of Sipix A6 paper (sheets) -- with me in my briefcase.Having to feed the sheets one-at-a-time into the printer is a little inconvenient. But the documents, once printed and stapled together (with the mini-stapler I carry with me), are much easier to read and file than with the A6 roll paper.The Sipix A6 thermal paper isn't cheap. But thermal printing eliminates the need for ink jet cartridges -- which keeps the printer smaller, less expensive (to operate) and much more portable -- which is not a bad trade-off."
1,Never got printer to work,"I don't know if the paper is of use. The company that made the product is now defunct. I was never able to get my printer to work. It came with a cable that did not work. I bought an IR device that never made a connection and then after contacting the seller, I bought the cable they said to buy. It still does not work."
2,"Great meal ideas, but they take too much time to prepare!","I bought this book imagining how much easier and heathier meal planning could be. What I discovered, after spending $120 for the first week of menus, was that this is not for me. I spent 1.5 hours in the kitchen on the first night of cooking! I am a very busy, working mom. I do not have that much time to spend on preparation, nor the money to spend over $100 per week on food items that I only use a portion of then throw away! I need a meal plan that re-uses leftovers (i.e., most of the english muffins in a bag instead of just one) and is more time/cost conscientious. Hopefully, I will have better luck with my next purchase!"
4,"Great Food, Low-fat & Easy to Understand","This book not only gives great nutritional advice, but provides good recipes the whole family can enjoy. I have 5 yr old & a 1 1/2 year old - they have cleaned their plates each night. There are a few recipes that seem a bit labor intensive after a long day - but they are very good! Most these recipes match what we like to eat - we have stretched on a few & really enjoyed them. This also matches my weight-loss needs since I am working with a program that require I track my exchanges & they are provided for each recipe!! No more guessing. Plus, I love the balanced meals for my family."
1,Not That Good,"I had high hopes for this book and was sadly mistaken, the food is mediocre at best, the portions are very small, i would recommend purchasing ""The 1200-calorie-A-Day Menu Coobook"" by Nancy Hughes if you really want good food with good portions!! i have also checked out other books by Ms. Smith and I was equally disappointed. I hope you have better luck than me."
3,Another The Kids Dont Like It Book,My kids were not fond of many if any of the recipes in this book . I don't have the time to cook for just me and not have family style meals. This might be better for a single person or a couple.
5,Science and Architecture Book Parading as Guide Book,"Hats off to publisher Johnson Books for making this wonderful ... book available to serious travelers headed for Machu Picchu. The book is accurate and reliable besides being easy to read and understand. Wright and Valencia have provided an insight to Machu Picchu that far exceeds what the best local guiddes can explain and without their lore and myths aimed at foreign tourists. The eight pages of glorious colored photographs complement the 160 black and white pictures and sketches. The fold-old colored map is a reduction of the map already hanging on the Fourth Floor of the Denver Art Museum. This book is a must for tourists, architects, engineers and archaeologists wanting to visit Machu Picchu someday. For those who have already visited the lost city of the Inca, you will appreciate it even more. Upon finishing the book, you will appreciate the pre-Columbian Inca people who created this masterpiece royal estate of Emperor Pachacuti."
3,Not so great,"This is a decent guide book if you have only a few hours to spend in Machu Picchu. I had a day an a half and was somewhat disappointed by the book: too little solid info and too much ""fluff"". For instance, the enclosed maps number all the rooms and buildings, but the text mentions only a few, with no attempt made to guess the use/function of the other ones. Not enough explanation is given of which parts are original and which are reconstructed. The visiting routes are often confusing and I found that exploring on my own was easier. The historical context and info on Inca life is spread throughout the text instead of being presented up front. On the positive side, the USA's author's husband is a hydrological specialist and the info on Incas' water management is solid.All that said, I have not looked at other guidebooks and this one may yet be the best one. It is certainly better than nothing or than what you can hear in a rushed 2 hours tour from a local guide..."
3,Nice to have....,"...but a tour is better. This was very informative in preparation for going to Machu Piccu, but the last thing you want to do when walking around the ruins is read a book. I took a tour which made the book unnecessary. If you have no plans to go to Peru, this book has fantastic pictures and gives a good sense of what it is like."
2,The batteries were bad.,"The re-chargable batteries which were brought with the rideo are not working. I charged them several times, and the last time I charged them more than 24 hours, but they still do not work."
1,Easy to install - but very poor quality,"This mirror was Prime-eligible - but otherwise I wasn't impressed:1. The manual remote (joystick) is inadequate - pretty much useless. Do not adjust the mirror while driving.2. The mirror smudges easily. (And to adjust it properly, you'll need to touch the mirror glass.)In order to install it, you will need a 2 mm hex key, a Philips head screwdriver, a 1/4"" drive socket wrench, and a 4 mm socket.(I needed all these tools, plus a 10 mm deep socket, to remove the old mirror from my 1992 SL2 sedan.)See [...] for additional installation info."
1,"Work but issues with seat shape, strength","I have used Russell Speed bleeders on several cars. They are an okay compromise if you must bleed brakes yourself and / or don't have a pressurized / vacuum bleeding tool and / or need the convenience for frequent track-side bleeds as I do. The internal check valve does work as promised but several of mine have leaked after many bleeding cycles, so I consider this an eventual wear item. The main reason for my single star rating is that they are more fragile than stock bleeders. There are no directions so during a recent install I torqued them to the factory original specs per my service manual, only to have one snap off, thus ruining my caliper and causing a very expensive repair. Another negative is that the seat angles are not identical to stock, so once installed they gall the seat in such a way that you may not be able to reinstall a stock bleed screw without leaking. In the end I'm no longer using them on current or future cars."
2,be very cautious of these,"I liked these at first, installed 3 without any problems.The fourth kept blowing out brake fluid and I kept tightening.Returned item and purchased another pair.the next one worked fine UNTIL the next day when I applied my brakes and the pedal went to the floor.Yes, brake fluid all over the place, removed the speed bleeder went back to the safer original bleeder.Did not want this to happen while traveling at high speed and needing to depend on my brakes to stop....."
5,Rhode Island history,"This little state has as huge a heritage as most of its bigger brothers. A lot of important history went down here, and this book will tell your students about it.The ""Portrait of America"" series is a wonderful introduction for pre-teens to the 50 states and to the places and events that shaped the history of the United States. This ""Rhode Island"" installment is particularly good. The book is broken down into sections like ""History"", ""Culture"", ""Economy"" etc., and each section is thoughtfully written and edited. The ""History"" section is especially good and is very inclusive.This book, as well as the entire ""Portrait of America"" series, will prove to be a valuable teaching tool to all primary school educators."
5,"Comprehensive, informative, helpful from page one!","This book is a must have. It is easy to read and helpful from page one. Powerbuilder developers, new and old, will find this book eases the transition from client-server development. The hints and warnings are excellent."
2,Does not fit 2009/Mk V Jetta,"I purchased these a while back with the hopes that it would fit my Jetta. The tail lights in the Jetta last about a year on average, which is typical of German cars and their substandard electrical systems. I wanted a big pack of lights since they are cheap and easy to replace and I did not want to blow $5 for 2 lights at my local auto parts stores. Unfortunately, these Wagner lights do not fit. The two little metal things that stick out from the bottom that line up with the tail light receptacle are too big. 2 of 3 items I ordered on Amazon did not fit my 2009 Jetta or my 2000 Subaru Impreza wagon. I hope the headlights fit... Not..holding...my...breath...Fail to Amazon.The 2 stars I am giving is for Amazon. Ideally, there would be a nice picture of the actual product. It has an orange glaze on the bulb. Product came quickly and was a good price. I can't test the product so I am not sure how the actual product works and if it outlasts VW bulbs, which are crapulent."
3,"A Preview, Rather than a Story","This 60 minute video is divided between ""The Age of Revolution"" and ""The Impressionists"" allowing little time for depth of detail for either. Sister Wendy gives an overview of each period and details some paintings in her own incomparable style, but it leaves one wanting to know more. This would be excellent as an introduction to the periods, but not as a definitive reference."
5,LOVE IT!,"This book is a great story. I wish it didn't end! It's a little slow in the beginning, but it really picks up in the middle. I'm definitely going to read ""Gods in Alabama"" next."
3,Interesting plot and setting,"I read this for my book club - we all liked the story, as it held some surprises (some predictable, some not). The experience of a child being raised by a deaf parent would have been a meaningful addition to this story, yet it was not addressed much."
5,'Fuedin' Fussin' and a Fightin',"If you're southern,you'll love this book. The characters jump off the page and become part of your life."
4,"Between, Georgia",I really enjoyed this book. The characters came across as being very genuine. I would buy another book from this author.
1,please save your time and effort to miss this one,OK IT WASN'T MY CHOICE BUT A BOOK CLUB CHOICE THE REVIEWS ARE GREAT I AM I MISSING SOMETHING ALL CHARACTER ARE CARTOONS WITH LITTLE BALLONS OVER HEAD SOUTHERN WOMEN HAVE MORE DEPTH ALL WOMEN HAVE MORE DEPTH THEN MS JACKSON'S CARDBOARD CUTOUT
2,"Between, Georgia","I ordered this book believing the author was Fanny Flagg, one of my favorite authors. It was listed in the books when asked for books by author. J. Jackson does a good job of mixing comedy/tragedy in the story, but her characters are very wooden and over-emphathized. It was an easy book to put down after reading a couple of chapters.At first I thought Joshilyn Jackson might be a non-de-pmum for Fanny Flagg, or vice-versa. If it is, the former named author was writing under an assumed name before the Flagg books were published!"
4,Great Read!,This was the first book I have read by Joshilyn Jackson. I really enjoyed the characters and the surprises! I was actually disappointed when I was finished. I will be reading more from this author for sure!
4,Excellent Southern Novel,"I'm a big fan of Joshilyn Jackson. She captures the South well and her books, including this one, are pleasant, fun reads."
5,Absolutely loved the insight....,...into the blind and deaf mother raising a daughter. It made me want to take a sign language class.
4,"Between, Ga","Ms. Jackson knows how to enchant the reader with her distinctive voice and unique style in writing. Between, Georgia is warm and heartfelt. It casts a light on deaf-blind people life and their survival techniques. Overall, it's not gods in Alabama yet It's still smart, funny with a twist. Looking forward for the next book."
4,Great reading - sorry to see the story come to an end,Loved this book! Characters had depth and were insightful! All of her books are GREAT READING!
3,Between Georgia is real,"My wife purchased this book and did'nt know it was fiction.Her Mother and Grand parents are from Between Ga.Its true its between Athens and Atlanta but its name derived from being between Loganville GA.and Monroe GA.The church in Between Ga. is a Methodist church, all in all its an ok book.There is lots of history in this very small little town."
