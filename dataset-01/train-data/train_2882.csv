5,"It didn't just beat my expectations, it SHATTERED them","This Tech Readout, including new (or previously unknown) vehicles and mechs for both the Inner Sphere and the Clans, was packed with more information than any prior technical readout. My only disappointment was a noticeable lack of ""Maximum Tech"" Level 3 equipment, but this was fully redeemed in the introduction of an entirely new technology, the Clan ""ProtoMech,"" I'll let you discover this little dandy for yourselves."
2,"Okay book, but half baked","I have read other Tech Readouts and this one ranks at the the bottom. Overall this book would have been much better if FASA had spent any attention to the pictures. I mean all the vehicles and the Inner Sphere 'Mechs are really really ugly. Also, I don't think the Inner Sphere industry could support so many new designs, so the story line isn't that well thought of. So many Tech Readouts in so short of a time cannot be good for Battletech. Tech Readout 3058 was much better."
2,photo backup,"I was looking for a photo backup program to backup the entire folder at once (5000 photos in the folder) This may have been good when I took my first photo, it requires a lot of work to seperate photos into diferent groups."
1,TopCell not as good as original.,The TopCell replacement battery for Makita 7.2 volt is not as good as the original. AH is too low making run time too short and not enough power.
1,Stopped working after one month,Poor quality. The light stopped working after less than a month. Design isn't very good either. The clip is too tight and damages the spine of some books.
1,Could never get one to work properly,"The first one that I ordered never really worked properly. It was as if there was a short in the neck of the light and the light would go from very dim to bright continually. Sometimes moving the neck would effect it dimming and brightening. After it would warm up(10-15 minutes), it would usually get better. I felt like this product was defective so I sent it back and ordered another one. The second one didn't work at all. I gave up with the product at that point and didn't order another."
3,Pretty good,"This light is definitely bright enough for reading in bed. I like the fact that the little goose-neck lamp retracts into the base for storage and travel. My one complaint is that the light gets in the way when you are reading at the top of the page. You can angle it to be above the book, but I read in bed and by doing that, the bright light is right in my husband's face. Otherwise, a good purchase."
3,Not to sure about this but it cuts,"These came in a plastic bag with a number written on it, so I'm not sure how to review it. I guess it's more for bulk type tree trimmers, who use a lot and need a good price. I was expecting more of a ""blister pack"" type with Oregon logos and directions, I just cut a few logs for fires, and trim a couple branches here and there, so it'll do for me. I like the low kickback idea, for safety. I don't know how to sharpen, so I figured a couple chains should last me a couple years, then, maybe I'll look into the art of sharpening little chain links."
2,Are these legit?,"These chants have a strange, 'new age' sound to them. Are they over-produced (digital echo?), or are they even legitimately Gregorian? In the 6th C., did the Monks ever 'fade out' at the ends of their numbers? I don't know, but if you're looking for historic music, you might want to research this set of recordings. I listen to other chant music, but these drive me insane: e.g., IV-Psalmus..."
2,Dirty Inside!,"The helmet arrived and the box was torn in some areas, worn down, and looked really old. Then, when I took the helmet out of the box and plastic bag it came in, the inside of the helmet was disgusting! It looked like something had spilled in it or something- one side of it was all sticky and covered in yellow/orange gunk. There was gunk in some areas on the outside and on the face mask too. What happened? Where had this helmet been prior to being shipped to me, ""brand new?"" I certainly do not think this was a brand new helmet and looked like it fell off the back of the truck or something. Very disappointing."
2,Avoid at all costs,"This album has none of the fire and class of any of the classic ABB releases (basically, anything from 1969 -'73 and from '90 onwards). It's a compilation of tracks from two dire, early-'80s albums recorded for the Arista label, which tried to push the band in a totally unsuitable MOR, Doobie-Brothers-style direction. Only two tracks are worthy of the ABB name - ""Leavin'"", which has some stinging slide guitar from Dickey Betts, and ""The Things You Used to Do"", which features strong, soulful vocals from Gregg Allman. Otherwise, the album is full of feeble, synthesizer-swamped pap. Definitely one for newcomers to avoid - go for something from one of the two periods mentioned above instead."
2,Allman Brothers' Worst,Madness Of The West is a combination of Reach For The Sky and Brothers Of The Road (kind of like Beginnings combined The Allman Brothers Band and Idelwild South) minus one track from the latter. These two albums were the worst albums The Allman Brothers released. There are 4 or 5 good songs and the rest are pretty bad. I'd recomend just about any other Allman Brothers album other than this.
1,"""Psychology"" without science","This text continues to be utilized as the seminal Relational Cultural Theory text by some and hailed as a revelation in the field of counseling psychology despite the facts that Miller and her Stone Center associates continue to produce no research to back their theory. and theory is based on suppositions that are actually contrary to the existent research on sex differences. Further, Miller simply reintroduces aspects of existing theories (e.g., Object Relations) which are treated as novel and singular."
2,Not a psychology book.,"This is an interesting book and addresses a number of issues that have been examined more completely in other books. Perhaps the most unfortunate aspect of this book is the misrepresentation of ""psychology"" when what is actually referenced is rather traditional psychoanalytic theory. The book would have been enhanced, and probably altered, by a careful review of actual psychological research and theory rather than a dated presentation of Freudian theory."
4,"NHL 06 is great, other titles okay","I bought this bundle primarily for NHL 06 and it is great. Real hockey action. Madden Football 06 is also pretty good but you have to let Madden call your plays or you get killed. Games take a long time so be prepared. Without a gamepad or similar device, the controls are too difficult to master. I haven't played the other games but my feeling from the documentation is that they are designed for folks with three hands and 8 fingers on each. What makes NHL 06 stand out is how easy it is to play in terms of controls while capturing the feel of real hockey. I was hoping for something similar with NBA 06 but it looks much more complicated."
3,Not as satisfactory as expected,The games would sometimes hang up while playing. I have a pretty fast PC at home and not sure why it just hangs. I have rebooted the PC and still the problem exists.
2,Amateur book,I don't know how the others can give this book such a high review. Maybe they're friends or relatives of the author. The book is so amateurish that the photo on the cover is fuzyy and out of focus!! And the projects are not interesting. Don't buy this book. Two stars was too good for this book.
3,Less than expected,I was a bit disapointed in the book itself. I was hoping for more information than it provides. The shipper was awsome though. Book is in good condition and packaged very well.
1,Poor quality hose.,It kinks easily and lasted a couple of months until water started to spray out of various parts of the hose. Just a poor quality hose. I am very disappointed in this purchased.
4,The love of words,"I was using a line from this book in a book that I'm writing and looked the book up on Amazon. I recall reading this book a long time ago and my thought at the time and now is that this book is about the love of words and looking a ""little"" life. No, it does not relate any big ""ideas"" but the writer was not trying to do so. It about seeing someone living life """"Now-a habit. Always plans, plans and no ideals"""" From: My Name Is Asya"
2,"Yawn,Snore,Bore","I have read the book My Name is Asya. I thought it lacked excitement,conflict,and climax. No climax,no excitement! It would be a lovely book for readers interested a Russian girl but it did not interest me."
4,two awesome bands on one awesome record...,"i was totally stoked when i found out that the bouncing souls (my favorite band) and anti-flag (awesome) were doing this split together...it's a great album. first off, the bands do great covers of each other's songs with the bouncing souls doing ""that's youth"" and anti-flag doing ""the freaks, nerds and romantics"", i'd really like to see every BYO split in the future have the two bands covering at least one song by each other, it's a cool idea. Both bands bring some great new material to the table (Bouncing Souls ""Punks In Vegas"", ""No Security"" and ""Bryan's Lament"" are really freaking cool)...Anti-Flag's new songs are very Anti-Flag, which is always a good thing. Go buy this if you like either band, you'll enjoy it."
4,Excellent rice...worth the price!,"This is the first ""expensive"" rice cooker that I have purchase...and it it certainly worth it! My family eats rice at least twice a week, and we use many different variaties. All have turned out perfectly.I do wish that the cooking vessel could go in the dishwasher..."
1,beware of this,I have had the same rice cooker for the last 15 years when it died. I replace with this thing that resembles a cooker. Frist thing it did when cooking it overflowed all over the place so I call the manufacturer they said I was using it wrong use less water so i did came out hard not enough?? So now it won’t cook brown rice have to keep pushing the button I’m going to replace this thing with a real one that works. hope this helps some one not to buy this
1,Zojirushi not longlasting anymore,"I had a Zojirushi rice cooker for 13 years. It still works but kind of smells stale when it cooks rice perfectly. I bought a new one. Within just a short time, it has malfunctioned twice. It is not made in Japan."
1,poor quality interior non-stick pot,"The non-stick interior pot started bubbling after a few months and chipping after 9 months. I do not know the consequences of ingesting the chipped metals. And the replacement interior pot costs over $56 (including shipping), with only 3 month warranty. From that, you can see how much confidence the company has on its products. I regret buying this rice cooker. Buy from a different manufacture!!!"
1,started having problems shortly after buying,"I had grown up with Zojirushi, so, of course, I bought one when I was looking for a new rice cooker. Unfortunately, shortly after buying it, the rice cooker kept shutting off (going to the keep warm mode) even though the rice was not done. At first, we thought maybe the seal was not tight, so we used a water bottle to keep the lid down...that worked for a while. Now I think we're at the point that we will need to replace the rice cooker. Thanks to this experience, I will probably not consider another Zojirushi model."
3,Not the same quality as old Zojirushi,My last Zojirushi lasted 12 years and was used 3 times/week. This rice cooker is made in Thailand not Japan. Therefore it wasn't the same quality as my old Zojirushi. The rice wasn't consistently soft. I brought another model Zojirushi that was made in Japan.
5,Perfect!,"I absolutely LOVE this rice cooker. I have no complaints at all. If you buy one, read the instructions, and then it will work perfectly every time. It's very easy to clean, the cord retracts, which is so nice, and, well, it's PERFECT. I mainly cook brown rice, but some others as well, and have been very happy with the results."
5,Fantastic,I have to say after reading other reviews this was a great purchase for us. We used our new rice cooker for family get-togethers as well as Potluck dinners with friends.
2,A disappointment,My last rice cooker finally died on me and I need to get a new one. I'm from an Asian family and we eat rice every day. After looking at some of the reviews I decided to give this Zojirushi rice cooker a try. With a Japanese name I thought I can't go wrong. I choose this simple model because growing up this is what my parents and our relatives used. And boy they worked so well. So what's wrong? It cooked well enough. The rice turned out nice and moist. It took less time to cook than the digital ones they have now. The only problem is the warm feature does not work. The rice turns all soggy and brown with an unpleasant smell. The instructions say it can keep warm for up to 12 hours. Well this happened way less than 12 hours. I was sorely disappointed and returned the item. This is made in Thailand. Maybe I need to look for one that's made in Japan ?
1,not worth the money,"I bought this rice cooker from another store less than a year ago, it stopped cooking, the cooker keeps on switching to keep warm when I wanted to cook rice. Oh well, I should have stayed with the brand I had before which lasted me 10 years."
3,Not as good as I remember,"I purchased this rice cooker for my mom because I remember that she had a similar one when I was little and it made the BEST rice. The rice is not as moist as I remember it...if I change my mind about how the rice comes out I'll post an update but so far not impressed for how it cooks vs price. Same quality rice from the $10 cheapy cookers. However, it does look pretty on the kitchen counter."
5,Cooks Wonderful Rice,"I bought this rice cooker to replace a less expensive Black and Decker model that had died on me after a few years service. I was a little scared to purchase a more expensive model rice cooker. I was afraid I would be spending a lot more money and getting the same results.I ended up being pleasently surprised. I just followed the cooking instructions, pressed the button, and it produced perfect rice. Better than I ever produced in my less expensive model. It will also cook perfect brown rice. I followed the instructions I had read from another reviewer, which was to soak the rice overnight, then cook with a little more water, and it turns out wonderfully too.I would highly recommend this rice cooker. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,Amazing,"Compared to all the other Bass Mekanik Cds this is my favorite, Has the best songs remixed, I recommend this one to buy if your looking for a good bass cd."
5,Doesn't get any better.,"Expensive, yes. If you are serious about cooking and have the need for a portable range, this is the one. I have tried one of the cast iron units and it worked fine except it took forever to heat up and cool down, was a pain the you know what to clean, and stained the cast iron top the first time I used it. This model heats up and cools down the same as my home ceramic range and is a piece of cake to clean. Love how light weight it is and the dual heating function. Highly recommended."
5,"A measured, thoughtful study.","Whitman's prosody has never been this closely examined.Dr. Martin's reading refutes some earlier scholarly studies, but he quite handily makes his case. Too bad not all literary criticism is this thorough and thoughtful."
1,Sucks,"This is the worst product I have ever purchased anywhere. It is my fault, should have known by the price! The first time I turned it on it chipped the blade and locked up (I have used planers since 1981) so it was not set up wrong. It cost too much to ship back so I was stuck!!!!!!!!!!"
1,It's Cheap And That's It's Only Advantage,"Like the other customer, I bought this without seeing a review and I am sorry I wasted my money on this piece of junk. The ""adjustment"" knob doesn't adjust anything and the instruction manual seems to have been writen by someone who didn't speak English as a first-- or even a second--language. This product's only advantage, if you can call it that, is the fact that this planer is cheap. It does it's job, but not as well as a more expensive planer could do.Keep away from this tool. Save your money for a better planer."
1,Not in Stock--They need to remove this from Site,You will get an email saying this is not available. Wish Amazon would clean this off so people don't waste time paying for it and then don't receive it.
3,Not great but the series is worth it.,"This book was rough and amaturish. There were gaps in the story line and leaps of logic I couldn't believe. Several times I was tempted to just quit reading, something I rarely do. However, I'm really glad I stuck with it. With each sucessive book in the series, Norman's skill noticably increased. The final two (thusfar) were outstanding. The information in this first book is important so read it just for background to the far superior ones that follow."
4,Wow!,I really liked this book! The next books in the series were nice also but this one began the tale and what a tale it is. It's a great book and only gets better as the books progress!
3,Hmm...I guess its OK,"But no more than OK. This book is appropriate for times when you need light entertainment with not much cerebral involvement. Sort of like watching your average TV show. The book has some loose ends and lacks sophistication. Oh, I almost forgot, thumbs down for a human future in which people are still addicted to smoking tobacco."
3,Falls more into the futuristic romance genre,"I give this book 3 stars as a sci-fi novel, but 4 1/2 stars as a futuristic romance. For those unfamiliar with the futuristic romance genre, it consists primarily of romance plot lines set in the future with sci-fi elements.I enjoy reading both sci-fi and romance novels, so I enjoyed this book as an entertaining, light read and am considering reading the next book in the series."
1,This book was barely readable. NO STARS,"Like other reviewers, I also found it hard to believe that anyone published this book. The basic concept is appealing but poorly realized. Many situations were absurd, like allowing a man-sized wildcat to sleep in a sick girl's room. Who would do that? Who would let a cat-sized wildcat sleep anywhere but in a cage? I found cigarrette smoking in a far future high tech colony to be ridiculous and annoying, but accepting the author's right create her world her way I still wondered why the character smoked on around page 3 then never wanted another cigarette, never even thought about one, till around page 130. The book was just barely not bad enough to not finish, and had it been longer I doubt this would have been the case. I am encouraged by the suggestion of others here that Norman gets better with later books, but I am a little concerned about the readers who wrote rave reviews: I was afraid I had wasted $35 buying the whole series."
2,The old Colorado & Southern And Engine No. 9,I like the film it self but the sound is really bad. The sound should be better. I understand the stuff is old but the sound could be much better.
1,NO SWEET EXORCIST _ FAKE PUB _ BEWARE !,The cover indicates clearly a mix by Richard H. Kirk (a.k.a. Sweet Exorcist) and when you listen to the Cd ... Kirk mix is not there! Check and look in the tracklist the back ... NO Cabaret Voltaire mastermind was involved. Bummers! Menteurs! Crooks ... And the rest is just unfortunate cheesy stuff. PITOYABLE! Bad... Bad... Bad... :-(
5,Power Cleanse is an excellent product,"Power cleanse is an excellent product. I have been taking it for 1 month and am on my second box. I started taking it per the instructions and immediately could see a difference in that I was feeling less sluggish. I had been using products for pre and post workout. Obviously with those types of supplements, you have to be careful of not taking too much for too long. I stopped using the pre and post workout supplements when I started to feel bad. It was not until I started the Power Cleanse that I began to feel better. I still use protein supplements and have a good diet but do not take any pre and post workout supplements.I would recommend this product and plan to keep taking it for a while. If you have never started a cleanse program of any kind, then you may want to take even less at first from what is recommended on the box."
3,Doesn't really sparkle,"It is an adorable necklace, but I was hoping for the CZ to sparkle just a little bit, but they don't. I would have been happier if this horseshoe was all sterling silver and no CZ."
4,"Very Good Family Movie, Beautiful Cinemotography","This was a christmas gift for my husband. We enjoyed the movie. It was beautifully filmed, great narrator and a good story. It's a enjoyable for people of all ages. The scenery is amazing and beside turtles is includes whales and dolphins. Its unbelievable what a turtle has to go through to survive and is amazing that they have outlasted the dinosaurs. We really do need to take much better care of the oceans. The movie is not preachy but very enjoyable and informative. We especially liked it because we live in Florida and often visit Gumbo Limbo Nature center where they rescue turtles. One of our favorite turtles Pheobe, who was released back into the wild, was the star of the movie. Gumbo Limbo tracked her for a while until her tag battery expired."
1,SAD. Over-dramaticized. And a little too much like Finding Nemo.,"This dramatized documentary is FULL OF CUTE TURTLES, but it is smarmy. There are much better, less anthropomorphized nature docs. I love a non-fiction movie, especially anything about biology, but this one is too contrived."
5,Perfect Crissy book!,This book has absolutely beautiful Crissy family pictures. I think a new collector would be in awe and an established collector would be keeping their wish list growing! Filled with interesting information too!
2,Encylopedia? Not Hardly,"When I buy doll collector books, I try to make sure they have everything I need to know about the doll in them. Sadly, such was not the case with this book. It had many nice pictures, but as far as being complete and usefull, I'd say it leaves much wanting."
3,Karaoke AK+US style!,If you love crooning along to Alison now you can do it with the backing tracks! great stuff and a load of fun.
3,Just an OK game,"First let me start off by saying that I am a Friends freak; I love Friends. I was very excited to get the game, but found it to be a little disappointing. Janice, Gunther, Jack and Judy read ALL the question to you, their voices get annoying. Being a big fan, the questions, even on the hard levels, were not challenging. To me it wasn't a game to play over and over, I play a round and that is it. It's not a game that is exciting, the board games are better. If you plan on buying, just don't have your hopes up."
1,"Love Friends, Hated this game","The TV show was great, but this game was terrible. We dug out the ol' PS2 to play this, and man, it was really like going back to 1995 to play a game. It was slow, tedious, and not very challenging at all. We played it once, and then I apologized to my partner for buying it. It is not comparable to Scene It beyond the fact that there is trivia. I had a Friends Trivia card game (kinda like trivial pursuit without a board) several years ago that was 100x better than this failure of a game. Two thumbs down!"
1,NEW,"I wanted this game from the second I saw it was coming out.BIG, HUGE Disappointment.For the true Friends fan - Don't bother getting since you will be the game in 5 min. Which was how long it took me."
4,Friends:The One With All The Trivia ( Playstation 2 ),"If you are a Friends fan then you will love this game. If not, just leave it be. This is the best Friends triva game out there so enjoy it, and it is a bit strange to to see the ""Friends"" on the cover of a PS2 game. It shows that the PS2 is a whore system and that the X-Box is for the hard core when it comes to games."
5,The pressure of an athlete,I recently had surgery and then again 2 weeks later repeat surgery same area. I bought this cd before the first surgery. I only required one pain pill when I got home.. The second surgery required no pain meds at home. The nurses also asked if I was an athlete because my blood pressure was so low. I was very calm going in and coming out of the hospital.
4,Not for organ transplants,"I listened to this CD and it seems very good. However, it is not for those who, like me, are undergoing an organ transplant. The meditation includes language that encourages the immune system to clean up and get rid of anything that it doesn't think belongs there. In the case of an organ transplant, that would seem to include the new heart, new kidney, new liver, or whatever. Not a good thing! There should be a special guided imagery CD for those undergoing organ transplants. This one isn't it."
5,Private thoughts made public,"I also am a Vietnam veteran and I came across this book merely by chance. I personally know none of the writers in this book,although there are some very famous names I recognize. Total strangers, yet their stories sound heart-breakingly familiar. You really should read this book to get an idea of what this war meant on a personal level. Oh,by the way,I reccomend keeping that proverbial box of tissues close at hand. Again,a very educational and insightful read."
5,Volkswagen Literature,"This is an excellent reference book for VW enthusiasts. There is a plethora of information and photos for the different models. Amazon's used sellers offered it for a crazy low price, and this book is well worth the money."
4,"Buy it for the Picture, not the sound","Purchased this today to replace a tiny 13"" in my bedroom. The picture is great. Right out of the box, plug and play. The remote is basic, but this is a basic TV and I'll be controlling the TV via my Tivo, so I don't care about the remote.The one complaint (hence only 4 stars) is the sound. I'm here to confirm that the speakers sound almost identical to my alarm clock radio. Although the sound is less than desirable, it offers an audio output via Digital Audio Coax cable (so you can connect to external stereo, etc). If you're looking for a great sounding TV and planning to utilize the TV speakers, this is not the TV for you. Since this is in my bedroom and used as a second TV, it'll work just fine.Other than the low quality sound, it is as advertised. Great buy for those of us who have not made the jump to HiDef yet."
5,Excellent review on race in America,"Mr. Shipler does a fine job in this book at examining how race impacts numerous situations in America. He leaves out, for the most part, Hispanics, Asian-Americans, Native Americans and other groups, in his focus on white and black, and readily acknowledges this - since that division is the one most discussed, it begs the most attention. A good analysis of race in the military, in education, in the workplace, in the family, in the communities - in basically every situation - is contained within this book. Mr. Shipler writes with a journalist's style, letting the voices of many different people be heard, without imposing his own too often. Well-researched, well-written and most definitely recommended. Books on racial issues are very common, but this one seems to stand out among them in many ways."
5,I cannot stop thinking about this book,"Three-fourths of the way through this book, I am blown away by what I have read so far. It is NOT an easy book to read, especially for someone like me, who has led a pretty sheltered life. Although I knew about 'slavery' and ""civil rights' and thought myself to be pretty educated, this book makes me realize that I have known NOTHING of the real world,the one that African-Americans, and other oppressed people, live in. I really appreciate the chance that this book has given me to see the world and live the day through their eyes. I find myself thinking about it all the time--do blacks really think of me like THAT? I wonder. Do I ever do THIS unconsiously? This is the kind of book that makes you ache for company to discuss it; to debate it; to share. If you belong to a book club, this should be your next read! I cannot say enough about how it has stirred my emotions, my imagination, my shame, and my sadness."
1,All Whites are racist.,"A friend of mine, who happens to be black, gave me this book. I am a 30yr old typical white male. After I read it I asked him why he wanted me to read it as it basically made me out to be a racist, no matter what my actions said otherwise. He said that books like this and their authors are the reason that their will never be any real equality in this country. Mr. Shipler likes to paint anyone of european decent with a ""broad brush"" in this book. My generation and the generations following me have a very different view of this world. We recognize the horrible injustices done in the past however we do not dwell on them. We recognize a person by the quality of their character rather than the color of their skin. Dr. King's message seems to have been lost on Mr. Shipler."
3,a troubling book,"One realizes that Mr. Shipler means well, but I found this book extremely patriarchal in both content and objective. I am not a member of the white race, nor am I male, so I am not particularly charmed by Shipler's eurocentric paradigms. While some of us are challenging the racism of white people on all fronts, others, who lack both courage and conviction, are trying to find ways of blaming African-Americans for their sufferings while the white male author tries to take credit for recognizing this. Mr. Shipler would perhaps have done a better job had he been willing to take the testimony of African-Americans at face value, instead of imposing his own misgivings about his own racial narrative."
3,the same dozen songs.....,"No doubt Aretha cut some great jazz, blues and pop sides for Columbia Records in the early sixties, before she went to Atlantic and became the Queen of Soul. BUT GIVE FANS LIKE ME A BREAK!!!! We want the entire Columbia Records albums re-released on cd, in their entirity, not the same rehashing of the same dozen or so tunes like the ones here. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely ADORE these songs, they are some of Aretha's best. But PLEASE stop releasing the same old same old with a different cover, or a different running order. SONY/COLUMBIA YOU ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOUR CONSUMERS AND OF ARETHA'S FANS !!! Lets have ""YEAH ! ARETHA LIVE WITH HER QUARTET"" or ""RUNNIN OUT OF FOOLS"" re-released on cd, and other titles long deleted by Comlumbia Records."
4,Some soulful singing!,"Aretha is a beautiful, strong, soulful performer - that much is well known all over the world.However, although I like her very much, I'm primarily a jazz purist, so I expected a soul/pop rendition of jazz and pop standards (probably with strings), and was therefore happy to buy this as an inexpensive compilation of Aretha's early years.If you are a true Aretha fan, this is not for you. No liner notes, scarce recording information, no pictures of the diva, no original artwork from the albums these songs were taken... Basically, this excellent music is shoddily packaged for us, casual fans of Aretha's singing.This Columbia/Sony/Legacy company really doesn't show its material and its customers all the respect they deserve. I've listened to another from this Jazz Moods series (Louis Armstrong) and the package was basically the same. Cheap."
5,The BEST yet.,The oven is the BEST yet in the small/counter top convection oven that i have had. Very will belt.
5,History of the rightly guided caliphs (may Allah be pleased with them),"It's a blessing to have English translation of Jalal ad-Din as-Suyuti's book (albeit an abridged version).This book documents numerous a'hadeeth related to the four giants of the ummah of Rasul (saw), Abu'Bakr as'Siddeeq (ra), Umar ibn Al'Khattab (ra), Uthman bin Affan (ra) and Ali ibn Abi'Talib (ra may Allah be pleased with all of them).The Section on Abu Bakr is as long as the rest of the khulafa combined, which is an indication of his status. Abu Bakr (ra) was the first companion to enter Islam, was the closest and most beloved companion of Rasul Allah(saw). He was the first to be elected the successor of the prophet (saw). He was the first to institute Baitul'Mal (public treasury) and the first one to gather the Qur'an (Uthman (ra) was the first to compile it in a book form). His virtues are numerous and his status lofty. They're a shining example for the ummah and the believers to come till the end of time."
1,The Khalifas who stole the leadership...,"...Islam has been hijacked by the first 3 khulafas ... there is not a single order of the Prophet SAW to have any one them as leaders, therefore it is bidda' (made up belief). The 4th one is an exception as he was explicitly commanded to be followed in Ghadir when the verse came that 'today I have perfected your religion for you ...'"
5,Support this musician.,"This is a MUST have for cd collector, music lover, hi-fi hobbyist I guess. This cd has a brilliant recording quality, which is probably one of the best of mine collections. And the singer's talent is obvious, that I can assure most of you, once you listened Elisa's cds, you'd feel comfortable and tranquil. Seriously, musician like Elisa deserves more applause. there's no doubt in my mind that this Italian musician has achieved something brilliant, beautiful, or I'd like to call it extraordinary."
5,Great Album with Great Bonus Tracks,"So Much for the Afterglow is a great album anyway, and the two bonus tracks on this Japanese version of the album make it even better! If you like the singles from this album, ""Everything to Everyone,"" ""I Will Buy You a New Life,"" ""Father of Mine,"" and ""One Hit Wonder,"" then you will more than likely like the entire album. Whether or not you've already bought the American version, I encourage you to consider buying this one, so that you can listen to as many Everclear songs as possible."
1,Don't buy it if you want to produce consistent sesame powder,"I bought this grinder to produce roasted sesame powder with consistency. The result was disappointing. At the fine setting, half of the mixture was intact sesame seeds."
3,Grinder for soft seeds,"I bought this to use on flax seeds, which are really only useful in your diet if they are first ground; and they don't keep nutritionally at all after they are ground. The grinder mechanism isn't powerful enough to grind flax seeds...works fine on sesame."
1,"Bad Grider, never buy it!","I bough this Grinder since it claim to be sesame grinder, but after I used it I found the sesame powder from it is not acceptable for food, they are too rough, I'm not able to eating it neither my baby, and also the grider plate (2 peieces to crack sesame is platstic, the will not last long!) btw you have to buy 4 AA batter."
4,magica,ive been a dio fan since the mid seventies when still in high school and i heard rainbow...man on the silver mountain..wow! who is this with such a powerful voice.. then i got rainbow long live rock and roll...i wore out that album as a young guitarist trying to learn every blackmore lick on there...then came sabbath with ronnie at the helm...heaven and hell....neon nights..great album and i also love mob rules....then came the eighties....and dio is back at it..holy diver..last in line...sacred heart....into the late eighties and early nineties....with different lineups....now listening to Magica is a bit different but a very enjoyable experience every time i listen to it...Magica is growing on me....solid album....solid story line!!!
4,Great utility knife,"This is an interesting little knife. It is hook-shaped, with the edge on the ""inside"" or bottom of the hook (bottom based on the picture in this listing).Construction: Single piece of steel. Very solid. I can't see this thing coming apart in my lifetime.Edge: Stays sharp for a long time. A bit of a pain to sharpen though based on the curve and position of the edge. I use an electric three-stage sharpener (theChef's Choice 120 Diamond Hone 3-Stage Professional Knife Sharpener, Whiteand it takes a while to get it just right. But I love this sharpener, don't get me wrong. Just be patient.Use: Don't forget which side has the edge! I do that at least once a week. Other than that, the knife performs perfectly and precisely. I use it for close-work boning and it works better than smaller paring knives.Overall this knife is well worth the price to get into a high quality piece of kitchen steel."
4,Quite a euphony!,Very good C.D.. it is worth buying. maybe a bit stereotyped but its soothing to ears.
5,An excellent album from a band with true talent.,"A year ago while traveling through Asia, I heard some of the songs off this album, and truely enjoyed them.. Upon returning to the States I searched far and wide and finally was able to find the album on the web. It was well worth the wait. An excellent album!"
4,Pan Quality OK But Size Misleading,"The pan size is 14"" from pouring lip to pouring lip. The actual inside measurments are 12.75"" at top, 11+"" inside bottom of skillet and 2.375"" deep. Quality is good but not Lodge. At price w/free shipping it was a deal."
2,Shang a lang Bay City Rollers,Worth getting for the Bowie cover (Rebel Rebel)but a Rollers Hits collection without Bye Bye Baby is pretty silly. The covers of I Only Want To Be With You and Be My Baby are somewhere between pointless and horrid.
2,Questionable product,"This thing looks like the size of my pinky, has no description, no specs whatsoever on its straightness, length, machining tolerances, etc. Why two stars? Well at least it's got a tiny picture to exercise your eye sight and stimulate your imagination."
5,"Finally, Excel's Power Tools Exposed, with Clarity","After a decade-long search I have finally found it-a practical, understandable, superb, and stellar codex which denudes Excel's cryptic power tools. With screen shots and pellucid narrative, and couched in the context of the real world, Jelen deciphers and leads us through the labyrinth of Excel's convoluted power tools.Finally, I am the master of the data menu. I am using more functions than I had ever imagined I could use.With bodacious, blistering clarity, Jelen provides the grand-prix exposure of how to USE pivot tables, probably Excel's most potent device. This premier explanation of pivot tables is sine qua non reading for all Excel users. The chapter on pivot tables, if read by enough people, would skyrocket white-collar productivity and spike the government statistics.This book leaves the tomes in the dust. This is the one. Do not wait. Buy it."
1,Terrible Construction,"My dog is rough on crates, but this was ridiculous. She tore through it in less than 2 hours. As previously mentioned, the welding on it is paper thin. Any pressure and the bars snap off. The bottom has holes that are large enough for the full sized beagle to slide through.Waste of money for a 2 day experiment.If your dog has any problems with crates, DO NOT BUY THIS."
2,FAILING WELDS..........,"We bought this crate for the compact design and portability, it is the best on the market.This dog is crate trained and uses a crates in out home. We bought this one for traveling. The first time we used it she broke out because all the welds on the upper front failed. She then bent the wire and the front collapsed inward. The dog was free and chewed.In the business we call these welds ""stick welds"" which do not hold.This crate should be recalled by the manufacturer.Joe"
2,Not Well Made AT All!,This crate is not well made AT all - when I removed it from the packaging (which wasn't damaged) a piece in the back was already bent. The rods aren't sturdy and my 6 month old 15 pound Shiba Inu puppy destroyed a previous crate by pushing his head through the bars so I knew he'd do the same thing with this crate. I returned it and wouldn't recommend it due to the poor construction.
3,Nice but...,"This is an awsome product. Only one flaw. There are no CLEAR directions. Only poorly done images.While setting it up, one of the security latches/locks on the top wouildn't hook over the top. After 20 minuted of frustration it finaly hooked. Only it was so tight I couldn't get my fingers out. Within 30 seconds my fingertips were blue/purple and I was screaming. Thank god someone was home or I could have suffered major damadge.The crate itself is nice though. Solid and sturdy. With a really nice plastic tray that is easy to clean.Just make sure that you have two people by when you set it up. And one should be REALLY strong."
2,Disappointed,"This iron worked well for 15 months and of course as soon as there was no more warranty, the thermostat stopped working. It is a shame that some of its parts are so flimsy. The heat is not equal and the same area on its sole always get scorching marks. I am rather disappointed. The cleaning process is tedious and did not really clean the iron from whatever stone got accumulated."
4,measure of all things dominates,"despite this album being new and very much improved there earlier album measure of all things was a 8 hit wonder. Each song was beutifully done. The vocals on this album are as great as ever. In time i have a feeling they will be a hit. With the more popular song ""the ocean is a..."" which has a blink but yet unique sound to it all together. This album is definately worth more money than some of the garbage being produced lately. So if you want a CD to get ya pumped up and give ya a good laugh occasionally check out amazing transparent man (ATM) you wont be disappointed. Thats all i gotta say"
4,"Beautiful shirt, great price","My daughter was in her first horseshow this weekend and this is the shirt she chose. She got it in the sleeveless Wild Orchid color and it was stunning on her, a very vibrant color that made her stand out. The cut was clean and well made albeit on the very small side. I ordered a 12 and it barely fit my tall 8y/o. I didn't have time to exchange it so we just worked with it. So if you order I highly suggest order a size or 2 up (I like to get things a bit big for room to grow) . Other then the sizing issue it is a beautiful product at a great price!"
3,Ad Classic,"It's starting to seem dated, but some of his scientific principles are timeless. His love of research shows throughout. You know he would have a field day with all the data behind Google Adwords."
4,"A quick, interesting read with solid advertising fundamentals","A solid book that focuses on the basic fundamentals of advertising by one of the most respected ""admen"" around. It's spattered with interesting stories and some history of advertising, however it is a bit dated since it was published before the Internet age.Although it may not be the most contemporary book, it still provides great insight and retrospect into how Ogilvy became the advertising master of his time. Anyone in the ad/creative/pr industry should find this interesting. Just keep in mind that things have evolved since this was first written."
3,"more philosophy than practice, but a must read","I liked, is a must read, and helps build the correct ""marketer approach"". I work as B2B marketer, so most of the ideas and suggestions helped to frame the sytle more than the strategy of my projects, but nevertheless I think the content helps create the mindset."
5,One of the greatest ad books of all time.,"What makes this book great? Everything. This book has it all because it lives up to what it's trying to convey and teach to the reader. Most books need just words on a paper to convey thought & provide imagery etc. When an author is discussing advertising, especially when illustrations are involved, you want to see the ad copy in the book also- the visual and verbal are equally important in this case. That's where this book delivers. The author presents the ad copy, then writes the play by play, or the backstory, of the ad- how it came to be, or why it is the way it is, or some type of research tidbit etc.Who should read this?- graphic artists- those involved in any type of marketing.. doesn't matter what, will help your mental juices to flow- entrepeneurs"
4,Information still pertinent,I found this book to be interesting and pertinent even though it was written in the 50s and 60s. If you want a glimpse of the ad world then-it is well worth the read. I recently rented the television series Mad Men and wanted to get a little more information about Madison Ave. during that time in advertising. The book confirms the heavy drinking that went along with creativity. David Ogilvy was a true pioneer and master in early advertising.
5,Outstanding,"This book has probably more than you would ever want to know about advertising. Veryimformative, even if you aren't a rising advertising star this book has it all."
5,Buy this now!,"A true classic, Ogilvy on Advertising is one of the best known books on what really works in advertising. And it's written by one of the best known and most successful ad men of the 20th century. In it, Ogilvy gives you his critique of many of the most successful ads ever written--plus you see a few that didn't fare so well.Though some of the ads may seem a bit dated, you can easily see how the same concepts can be tweaked and updated to work just as well today. If you plan on doing any advertising at all, do yourself a favor and buy and study this book."
4,A very good book on adverising,This was a great book from an advertising legend. David Ogilvy writes about what makes a successful advertiser drawing from his years of experience. The best part for me was his recommendation to read Tested Advertising Methods by John Caples. Mr. Ogilvy breaks down his advertising method and there are a lot of samples of real advertisements that worked. Even though it was written in 1984 his methodology applies to Internet markeing.
4,Good insight into the advertizing world,"This book has many photos, perhaps too many. It has good substance, but I expected more. Be aware that some of the pictures have artistic nudity. I consider this book important enough to keep it in personal reference library."
4,"The ""bible"" is getting dated...","When I first read this book in 1988, it was an inspiration. Now, thirteen years later, it seems a shade out of step with the times. Admittedly, that's Ogilviy's whole point - that his concepts are timeless - but I'm not 100% sure I agree. That said, this is one of the few advertising books that EVERY ad professional or aspiring ad professional should read. One odd note: He GOES OFF on ads that use text in all capital letters, yet the cover of his book employs them (to wonderful effect, I might add). What gives?"
5,For anyone who uses creativity at work,"This is one of those rare books everyone ought to have to read. Like ""The Elements of Style,"" ""Writing That Works, and ""Profiles in Courage."" I had read this book back in 1990 when I was out of work, looking for a job in advertising. The advertising job never happened for me and I moved on to other things.I did not realize, until I recently picked up a copy to re-read, how much it had influenced me the first time I read it. Half of the way I conduct myself at work and a lot of my thought processes and strategy is still influenced by what is in this book. I make over 6 times what I made back in 1991. I realize now I have Mr. Ogilvy to thank for a great deal of that.Read this book. At least once."
5,The Master plys his trade,Ogilvy is a master and this book is an insightful look into the world of advertising.
5,Learn from the best,"I owned an Advertising Agency for 27 years -- this was the only book on my desk. I read it again each year or whenever I felt I didn't have any ideas. I have been retired for ten years now and I still read it once a year. First advertising book I ever read and still the one that inspires me most. I know it must seem ""old hat"" to the newbies coming up today -- but you need to know where to start and learn advice from the best. What ever I accomplished in advertising -- awards, great clients -- I owe it all to Ogilvy."
4,Do our modern advertisers know about this book?,Ogilvy is definitely the king of advertising. A must read for anyone though some examples may seem outdated. Wish our modern advertising folks read this book and then plunge into creating an ad.ThejendraAuthor of The Mirage Peddlers
5,Lasting Advice from a True Mad Men,"I will keep this simple and concise. The reasoning behind the purchasing decision of this book is easy to understand. Mr. Ogilvy was a advertising pioneer and was willing to share his experiences in the industry to up-and-coming talents like myself.I had doubts about the book because if the book was to be a ""how to"" for advertising, how would it stack up to the advertising world of 2012? To my surprise and delight, the book is extremely relevant for any copywriter, art director, account executive or higher executive level who wishes to learn to become better at their trade in todays age. If you are a freelance worker, it will help as well. If you wish to find advice on digital media, there is no mention of that but the principles still apply to any medium of advertising and Mr. Ogilvy maps them out perfectly.It is a great book and will benefit any who wish to learn from an idol. Enjoy."
1,Way way way outdated,I'm sure the book was amazing in it's time. However these days it's just useful for people studying the history of advertising.
3,Contradictory and dated information,"While there was some interesting iformation, I found it to be contradictory and rather dated. Ogilvy states 90% of consumers don't read ad copy. He then gives the impression that THE most important piece of information in the ad is its headline. Yet, what is Ogilvy know for...85 million words in his copy. This book was also written 20 years ago. Thus, the stats provided are dated. He informs the reader of the importance of research...well, duh. His writing style was arrogant...every opportunity available he cited awards won, compliments given, people he met and who idiolized him. He even put a picture of his mansion in the book...see how much money I made. So far the most valuable pieces of info I've read was a 1946 typed memo from Leo Burnett discussing the importance of humility and Leo's infamous ""When to take my name off the door"" speach."
2,No longer applies to the ad world today,"I think this was an interesting book for itstime, however the ideas set forth hereare no longer practiced by the company thatOgilvy created."
2,High expectations... but was disappointed.,"I bought this book based solely on the great reviews it got here on Amazon. I usually agree with majority opinion on books but I do not in the case of this book. I found the material out-dated, uninteresting, and boring. To be honest I couldn't bring myself to finish it. It must have been written like 20+ years ago because all they talk about is print vs. radio or radio vs. TV. I remember a line saying something along the lines of ""TV is the greatest communication medium ever!"" That right there sums up the book IMHO. The internet is here Mr. Ogilvy -- perhaps you're retired and/or don't care any more, but the rules of the game have changed. Ogilvy on Advertising is antiquated. I would recommend the books by Al Ries and Jack Trout -- The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, Positiong, etc. as an alternative."
1,way out dated.,way out dated. 95% of the material don't apply no more. the best way to learn art of commercial is to watch one.
4,Amusing prose,"Who in the world of advertising doesn't know the name David Ogilvy? For that alone, I recommend this book as Necessary. It's so important for advertising and marketing professionals to learn from those who helped shape our industry and to continue expanding their knowledge base. Mr. Ogilvy's prose is entertaining and honest. Tooting his horn, he discusses successes with great pride, but he also is humble in sharing mistakes he's made. His book is all encompassing, covering so many aspects of the ad industry - even where to look for a job and the descriptions of each category. If you are looking for a text book on advertising, this isn't it. This book is more like sitting down with your mentor in a quiet restaurant with a glass of 20-year old scotch and reminiscing over his career."
5,Love this book,This book is my first of the Shannara legacy. And I loved it. I was hooked from the 1st page. I enjoyed how the book changes from each characters story by chapter. It kept me not wanting to put the book down. It does end with a cliffhanger ensuring you'll read the next book. I had no trouble picturing the world Hawk and Logan and Angel live in. The characters are all likeable and the action is excellent. I defiantly recommond this book to everyone. And I can't wait to read the next book.
2,Series Growing Old,As I continue with the Shannara series they have grown very old and boring. This latest book tops off a steady decline in action versus charater detail which started the last set of books. I noticed this trend in the conclusion of the last series where you can go 3/4ths of the way thru the book and see little suspence and Armageddon's Children is no different. Brooks has lost it period and this is the worst of the Shannara books.
3,Regarding this book and the trilogy,"I just finished reading this trilogy and just finished writing a review for book 3, ""The Gypsy Morph"".""Armageddon's Children"" was the best of the 3 books because the other 2 were bogged down with too much character introspection and flashbacks to events from this book and book 2.I got these books from the library and recommend others to as well.As others have mentioned, this book ends with a cliff hanger, but if you are getting the book and it's sequels from the library, this isn't a big deal.Having read this series, and having read others comment that the series before this was Brooks best (The Word and the Void series), I am inclined to read that series and maybe read ""The First King of Shannara"" as well as reread ""The Sword of Shannara""."
4,If you like Terry Brooks,"As a reader of Terry Brooks since the original Shannara Trilogy, I was eager to read this series about the earliest origins of the Four Lands. I was a little startled when I opened the book and foun myself at the dawn of the 22nd century in a post apocolyptic Indiana! It was an enjoyable book with a compelling story. Brooks has always told a good story. For the nitpickers out there, Brooks has never really become a good writer, just a good story teller. The characters tend to be flat and the writing cliched, but the story is always compelling. I enjoyed it, as I have always enjoyed his novels."
4,Great Armageddon's Children,This is a really good book. It continues on with the Gypsy Morph (Hawk) and shows his life and stuff. Very interesting. Hard to put down once you start it. Highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the Shannara books!!
2,Not much I can say.,"There isn't much I can say about this book. It's not terrible, but I felt a little bored throughout the entire story. I tried to get into the Running With the Demon stuff a while back, but I couldn't stand that. This, for some reason, didn't seem quite as bad, but a lot of nights I had to force myself into the mood to read it. I also felt that Brooks spent way to much of the book explaining the same material over and over. He could've added a little more action and adventure in there instead of drilling it in our heads that the story takes place in a post apocalyptic world and that these kids have a tough life. Anyways, I think Terry Brooks fans will enjoy it, but I wouldn't recommend it to somebody just looking for something new."
1,Deceptive,"I don't normally read fantasy, but the first 3/4 of this book was a nice surprise. I thought it was an entertaining readThe cliff-hanger ending was infuriating. The book practically cuts off in mid-sentence. I'll probably return it, and I've never done that before. There is no indication that the book is part of a series and, in fact, the book jacket recommends it as ""the perfect opportunity for readers unfamiliar with Brooks's previous work to experience an author at the height of his considerable storytelling powers."" If they are going to explicitly market the book to readers unfamiliar with the author they should clearly disclose that the book is part of a series and in no way a stand-alone novel."
5,Armageddon's Children,"Brooks has started a wonderful story line that begins to link the word and void with Shannara. Once I began reading, I just couldn't put the book down. A must read book for any Terry Brooks fan."
1,"poor lit, poor fantasy","The book is readable but is no where near on par with McCarthy's The Road or even less so with Lessing's Mara and Dann. I found it kind of a hodgepodge of silly stories too fantastical to be good fantasy. I didn't like the religious overtones. There are too many demons, elves and fairies and such introduced as if the author is having a hard time figuring out what to write about next... There are a number of grammatical, even spelling errors, too. There is much better fantasy literature, and literature out there. I won't read any more Terry Brooks. Waste of time."
1,Where is the rest of the story ? There is no ending.,"Did Terry Brooks die before finishing the book and they went on and published it anyway ? There are four distinct stories going on, all interesting, but mostly unrelated. As the book goes on the relationships between them begin to become apparent. Then all four are just left hanging and you hear ""Thank you for listening ... "" and it's over. Did they make a mistake and leave out half of the book or what ? Infuriating !"
3,Typical Apocolyptic,"Armed camps, poisoned atmosphere, dark despair. Nothing new here. Try Moses Probe by Ted Magnuson for a different spin on 'the end of time.'"
1,"If Al Gore wrote fanrasy, this is what he would write...","I wanted to read a fantasy book, not have someone attempt to indoctrinate the evils of our modern civilization. According to this author, we'd all be better off living in tribes, worshiping nature. Meanwhile, people like Al Gore and this guy are among the earths heaviest consumers."
2,"If you love animals, don't read this book","I was enjoying this book even though it is dark, until he graphically described the killing of a dog."
2,"Dreary, slow, disappointing ending","So many of Brooks novels are inspiring and exciting but Armageddon disappoints. The post apocalyptic setting is dreary and depressing with redundant descriptions. Even the characters are drab, shallow and depressing. The plot is slow in developing and then ends without any resolution. Your reward for hours of suffering through is a complete disappointment."
4,Fantastic,"Loved this book. It is the first book I have read written by Terry Brooks, I have already purchased the next book. It is inventive and original. Kept me spellbound from beginning to end."
4,A Projected Review,"To be absolutely honest about this book, I have not read it as of this date. Terry Brooks has been and remains one of my favorite authors ever since I read his Sword of Shannara and Elfstones of Shannara books. I am anticipating feeling the same about Armageddon's Children as I feel about the two books I mentioned. From my particular standpoint, I will read just about anything that Terry Brooks writes."
3,Different,I started reading this and got into it rather heavily. Then the author started changing gears on me which through me for a loop. All in all it was good reading. I will definately buy the sequel.
5,DELIGHTFULLY EXOTIC TASTY THAI RECIPES,"This is a wonderfully clear, concise cookbook with easy-to-follow recipes and colorful photos that represent various Thai dishes and the lovely art of Thai display. The book fits perfectly on any shelf, and the spiral allows it to lay flat so you can simultaneously follow directions and prepare food. It is well arranged and thought out, and the mouth watering recipes are simplified for people on the go. This is a definite for your cookbook collection! Highly recommended."
2,Kept food warm--when it stayed on See UPDATE,The server seemed to be great at first but after a short time began tripping the circuit. We tried other outlets and found that it only tripped GFI circuits. The only non-GFI outlet in my kitchen is behind the built-in microwave. Inconvenient! UPDATE BroilKing replaced the faulty base. The replacement seems to work great.
5,"Absolutely amazing, Buy this mcd now","Straight out of ontario comes Boysnightout. I heard of about bno on ferret records bands page, and went to their site... and downloaded the single ""where we breath"" and was blown away by it. This is an amazong band, and its a shame more people havent heard about them, but trust me you will hear about this band, they are that good. Broken Bones and Bloody kisses is the perfect mix of Sung/ Screamed vocals, top notch guitar playing, great drumming ( although hard to hear in some songs) and great bass playing. All around this is a great cd by a band that has a lot of potential and are getting the recognition they deserve. Look around in music stores near you for this cd, its one of the best cds you could buy this year, you will not be disappointed"
3,works ok but hard to clean,"I got this rice cooker brand new and have been using it since 8/2002. My family and I use it 1-2 times a day, every day.Pros:-White rice option works great.-Cute design.-Time pre-set option.-Retractable electrical cord.Cons:-Inner lid can't be removed, which makes it hard to clean. With regular use and/or over time, fluid/food accumulates and the fact that the outer and inner lids aren't removable, means having to tilt the whole unit upside down while slowly rinsing. This is while avoiding water in other parts of machine.-Porridge option makes porridge that's too thick, very much the consistency of rice pudding, no matter how much extra water you put or if you pre-soak the rice. I was hoping for more-liquidy porridge.-Expensive.Overall, if I had to choose again, I would not go with this item. My experience with this product definitely makes me think twice about buying any Zojirushi product. I would rather go with a Tiger rice cooker next time."
5,Miracles in Technology - Perfect Rice,"I purchased this machine from a local cooking supply shop, after doing some online research. The person who sold it to me told me that it was useful for little more than making really good rice. As I found out from research - that is simply not true. 'The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook' by Beth Hensperger and Julie Kaufmann (ISBN 1-55832-202-7) gives you excellent recipes that are wonderfullly suited to this device. It's the manual you wish you would have gotten with this device."
4,woodmason's book is an excellent resource,"Woodmason's account is an excellent resource for anyone studying frontier life of the American South prior to the Revolution, as well as for those studying the Anglican Church in America before the Revolution. It is a refreshing change from other resources on Anglicanism in the pre-revolutionary South, which mostly deal with Virginia (Woodmason ministered in what is now South Carolina and parts of North Carolina). Woodmason provides great insight into the anti-British sentiment of the Scot-Irish population on the frontier; his narrative also speaks to the religious tension on the frontier between established churches, upstart churches, and the multitude of the unchurched settlers. It is entertaining and well-written, but somewhat difficult to read if you are unaccustomed to the cadence and terminology of 18th century English. Overall, I highly recommend this book for researchers and students; it may not necessarily be something you want to take to the beach"
3,A Werewolf Among Us by Dean Koontz,Rare find. Glad I bought it and read it. Not one of his best reads but worth reading at least once. Great for a collection!
2,Poor Quality,"Cheap looking dull plastic. Warped boxes. Purchased two for gifts of which only one worked, and then I got stuck with it due to their 3 day return policy. Batteries for the tester were rusted and even corroded. :("
1,Junk,"The plastic is flimsy - it arrived cracked. The battery test is terrible; it's hard to get work as the connections aren't good - very poor design. I would not recommend this item to anyone. Do not purchase this, it is junk."
1,xxx,"Stand looks nice, but is not sturdy. It wobbles back & forth and, if it were not such a hassle, I would return it."
3,Looks very nice!,"I ordered this quilt stand to hold my comforter as we take it off the bed when we are sleeping. The stand looks nice and does the job, but our comforter is very fluffy so it doesn't drape over nicely, but it works for our purposes. The type of quilts that would hang nicely are the hand stitched or thinner quilts and you could hang more than one. The stand was easy to put together and was shipped very quickly. I'm satisfied."
4,Great for teachers,This is a fantastic resource for anyone who needs a thorough overview of the Renaissance. I used it to teach a History course to 7th graders. Great pictures too!
1,Buy this book only if your blog deals with the number of cats your mother has,"I will be brief for this review: don't buy this book if you have at least a small idea about what you want to write on your blog. This book only gives you some hints if you have no clue about the content of your blog. If this is the case, then you should not write a blog, and therefore there is no use to buy this book. My ten years old sister could have given the same advices about what to write when you have nothing to say."
1,No One Cares What This Book Has to Say,If you are over the age of 13 you really don't need this book. Surely by now you've had enough life experience to come up with something better.
1,No one cares about the contents of this book.,"If you feel that your blog is getting a little too succint and you want to lighten it up with some real drivel go immediately to Ms. Mason's book, open any page and do what she tells you."
5,"A great writing motivator, and a cockle-warming read!","What I most love about this book -- aside from the writing, which is toothsome and smart, and aside from the breadth and creativity of the suggestions that the author, Margaret Mason, comes up with -- is that it's also a tender love letter to blogs themselves. Many of the Ideas featured in this book offer examples from actual bloggers, from well-known cewebrities to people I have never clicked on before. And these bloggers that the Maggie has currated together, they're doing such wonderful things. Their writing, photos, films, drawings, childhood mementos ... it's all so inspired and inventively assembled. This book is the perfect reminder that good people are out there doing great things, and that you, too, might even be able to join them."
4,"Useful, if you have personal blog, not so - if topical or business","Rating this book is very daunting task. This is a case, when choice must be n/a instead of giving rate at all. Why? Because book can be buried treasure coffin for one blogger and worthless text for other.Depends what you need.To simply put it - if you have personal blog, where you mumble about politics, sisters cat and your fathers late girlfriend (and how you hate them both) - you will find here topics to write for next 25 years.But you write a topical blog, like I do, or even more - if you blog for business - there will be maybe 10 or so topics you can use.And that's great I think - I personally would never give 1 star to this book just because I could not use - it does not means that everyone also also can't. Think about your blog type before you grab this book. Anyway, even if you can not use most of topics after all it's entertaining read."
1,No reason to care about this book,"I ran across this book while searching my library's database looking for cookbooks for packing lunches. I always love serendipitous finds so was excited about requesting this book -- great title and I am always tempted to start a blog. This book is reason enough to stop ordering books from the library without looking them up on Amazon first. This book wasn't worth the effort to put it into my library bag with the other books I picked up. The book offers 122 pages of random ideas that if someone needs they really shouldn't be writing a blog because they are so completely clueless. Picked from a random page in the book ""You have 15,000 saved emails on your hard drive. There's got to be some good material in there. Mine your old files and post amusing excerpts from emails of yore."" I can't believe someone actually published 122 pages of this type of trite commentary."
5,Outstanding Wild Rice,We love wild rice and order 5 lbs. or more every year. We received our order and cooked some--I have just ordered some more because it was the best quality I have found in several years. It has great flavor and aroma.
5,"It does what it says: aptly named, ""essential review""","I bought this to help me prepare for quizzes in US history class. It does the job! There's not a lot of fluff, not a lot of cool features (I like the music though!). It's just a really great review tool. The idea generator thing is really neat."
3,"Interesting, but not for bagpipe prowess","If you're looking for some stud playing bagpipes like there's no tomorrow, this is not the place. You can find plenty of Celt/Scots or early music players' recordings for that. Harley is interesting because he had the guts to try something that was never done before, or much since, and that was to apply bagpipes to jazz. This kind of experimentation is completely lost on most music today and that's too bad. A friend who has acquaintance with some notable pipers says they ridicule Harley since his tone was slightly off, he held the pipes over the wrong shoulder, etc etc. True, but he was the first ever at what he did and you can't take that away from him. This set is more than complete...a shorter ""Best Of"" might be the better introduction to his work. By the way, he was not a bad sax player...as heard on some examples here."
5,A Guide to Meaningful Relationships!,"""Are You Fit to Love?"" is truly the path to meaningful, healthy love relationships. Allie Ochs embraces the genuine power of love: mutual respect and moral responsibility. I love this book. You will too! Highly recommended."
5,A Pilgrimage,"I couldn't put this book down until I finished it. Marg's gift for touching hearts everywhere she travels keeps spreading by way of her book. Truly inspiring, a modern day pilgrimage."
2,Needed a good editor,"There are already a number of positive reviews of this book, but this is not one of them.I found this book to be sorely in need of a good editor. As it is, this book is a stream of consciousness that meanders along, dragging the reader through too many unfinished currents.It doesn't work well as travel writing because she lacks critical detail in many places.It doesn't work well as a spiritual discussion because she is too shy as a writer and maybe too didactic as a moralist.It doesn't work well as biycle literature because she doesn't talk much about bikes.This novel is arranged as a series of vignettes. What it really needed was a strong editor who could see its disparate units and force the writer to come back with a cohesive narrative.There are portions of the book that are interesting, but a reader might do well to hold back on the credit card information on this one because there are so many other excellent bicycle-travel-spiritual journey books out there."
5,He can't write a bad song.,"I've been telling people about Mason Jennings for two or three years now, and noone is listening to me. This guy is the real deal. His songs are at times humorous while at other times heart wrenching; sometimes political, sometimes sugar coated gum drop ferry land fun times, but all are amazing. This album is no different. From the very first jumping song ""Crown"" to the last ""Ulysses"" which has a familiar ""Birds Flying Away"" sound to it. LISTEN TO HIS MUSIC!!!!"
1,Disorganized and uneditted...,"I have never read a book with so many spelling mistakes. Either these 'Words of Wisdom' were not reviewed before printing, or the majority of those quoted are dyslexic.This book appears to have been compiled by a small group of stupid Monkeys!"
2,There are better CDs out there,"The quality of the sound is not as good as most CDs. At times the vocals are not crisp and sound muffled. It is also somewhat boring, since it has a very repetitive feel to it. For bellydancing, this CD does not inspire me and it usually does not take much to get me going.""Turbo Tabla 3"" is ok, but this track is also on ""Bellydance Superstars, Vol. II"", which is a lot better investment."
3,Not my style,"I bought this CD because I'm a big fan of one of its tracks (Turbo Tabla 2). I was hoping for more of the same, but I was disappointed. I prefer to dance to music that is less harsh and that has a stronger beat. Turbo Tabla 2 is on Bellydance Superstars vol 2, which I think is a much better album."
5,Latin Party 99,"Very Good Album , very good track list and good Megamix , ideal for the dancing , VERY GOOD BUY FOR ME COLLECTION"
1,UNIMPORTANT BUNCH OF INTERVIEWS,Boredom from 1960s/70s reject Kael----though does have her racist comment about how she felt frightened (!!!) watching EDDIE MURPHEY RAW with an audience of african-americans...! An old Jewish liberal all scared to death in an audience of African-American movie goers!
1,Way too small!,"For the sake of your betta, please do not purchase this inhumane excuse for an ""aquarium"". This is far too small to house any animal. Sure bettas CAN live in small areas, but then again humans CAN live in a closet if given food and water...but would you want to? Your betta doesn't want to either."
1,Too Small!!!,Too small for a temporary home. Not bad I guess if you wanted to put one in there while your changing your REAL tank. You can get a 5 gal for cheaper at some places. Please be kind!
3,Who came up with the ice cream cone?,"The author of this book puts her research of the ice cream cone into an interesting, kid-friendly format. I love the way the author discriminates for the reader the difference in the facts and the fiction. That is what makes this book different! She begins with her researched facts, and then in the middle of the story, when her info becomes lacking, she writes ""this is what I imagine"" and further still, speaking directly to the reader, ""Remember, this is still the made-up part."" When the facts become clear again, she writes, ""This last part is true...""This book would be a great way to inspire kids to research topics of interest. It would be a great example of a topic in which not all of the data is out there- sometimes an investigator must piece together the puzzle. For teachers, I would use this book with elementary grades 3-5. (Teaching objectives: fact v. fiction, text structure.) It is way too factual for younger kids."
5,An excellent compilation.,"What can I say about Poe that hasn't already been said more eloquently? If you like his work, then you will like this book."
5,good stuff and the price is right,"Edgar Allan Poe wrote some of the most iconic, most memorable, supernatural, gothic or whatever other type of horror there is in literature. Thanks to his works being pre-1930 something, they are public domain. This means anyone can use them and do what they will with them.Thankfully, someone has taken the works off of Project Guttenburg and provided them on Amazon for free. In this case, the someone is Amazon.They can charge for delivery, of course, which as of right now is free over Whispernet. And if they packaged it physically, it would be the same - charge for the cost of printing and making a little profit."
3,Good if you love Mr Poe,If you enjoy Mr Poe this is a must read. If you are not then you may want to stick to volume one.
5,ty,I love everything and anything Edgar Allan Poe. need I say more? I plan on owning a copy of all his works. ty
4,I've been sleeping too long!!!,"I recently seen Encore perform with Hiero and Little Brother. He flowed so nice that I had to pick up Self Preservation. Encore has to be one of the most underrated cats in the game. I should know. I was one of the many that didn't pick this up in 2000. Almost every joint is tight. A few of the guests are hot as well. Especially Grand the Visitor and Pep Love. I know his new joint, Layover, is dropping today so be sure to get both. Encore is one of the best in the game. Period."
2,utterly un-noteworthy,"Encore has a good flow. He has good lyrics. The beats are good. Ho-hum. This album is so boring. It's so average good which i think is less interesting than abominably bad though i wouldn't necessarily listen to either. Like Rasco, Planet Asia, and others, Encore is a good emcee who can be great on individual tracks but would you really want to listen a whole album's worth of tracks that add up to not much more than a few ideas, not many of which are original? If you're looking for more of the same, this is the album to get!"
1,NOT The Classic 1969 Album,"This is NOT the original, classic 1969 album ""Pride In What I Am"". Several record companies have released Merle Haggard compilations using the exact same titles as the original albums, apparently hoping to deceive buyers into thinking that these are the original LP's. Putting the term ""Classic"" on the cover compounds the deception. Also be aware that this CD only has eight songs! For the same price, the record company could have quadrupled the number of songs and still had room for the original ""Pride In What I Am"" LP as well! Check the song lineup of the original LP's on any country discography site or Merle Haggard's official web site before buying any CD that appears to be a re-release of an older LP."
3,"nice compilation, but was it recorded FROM a television?","Okay, I realize that a lot of original sound elements from various television series are probably gone forever. I understood this very well on the Hanna-Barbera cartoon box, although some original tape material was there, but most of those recordings were 35-40 years old. Well this P.I. Themes CD should have most if not all of the original sound elements available for use. And what you will get with this CD are remarkably clear theme songs, most of which you will remember. What you won't get are many original stereo studio masters. You could probably achieve the same fidelity as this CD from burning a CD on your computer equipped with a TV tuner card...hence my 3 star rating."
5,THIS CD IS DA BOMB,"Ok, first off, the album starts off wonderfully with ""Worldwide"", and then leads up to other crazy songs like ""Call of the Wild"" and ""I Ain't Havin' That."" I would list all my personal favorties but that would be listing the whole CD. This CD right now is one of my best ones that I have, next to Kurupt and the Wu-Tang. Then Heltah Skeltah mixes it up by adding Tha Dogg Pound and having Method Man come on some of there tracks. Their beats and lyrics are excellent. For their beats I would give them a 10 out of 10. They were just fantastic. And my advice to everyone out there is to get this CD. LISTEN TO ME AND GET IT. It is worth its price."
4,new directions in Indian jewelry,"This book by Lois Dubin continues the tradition she has established in her two previous books:they are clearly written, highly informative, and have beautiful illustrations. Jesse Monongya's jewelry is a real departure from traditional American Indian jewelry, and may be a stretch for some people.but ithe jewelry is a work of art, and the illustrations really help the reader to see that. time to move beyond traditional silver necklaces and bracelets, and into the 21st century. Looking at the work in this book is helping me to expand my appreciation of the art of jewelry."
4,Opal Bears and Lapis Skies,"I received this book as a gift from someone who knows I've had a preference for traditional, old-style Native American jewelry and crafts. It was good to learn, in depth and through this example of one artist, that contemporary Indian arts can be rooted in the same ancestral basis of geography and cosmology that produced earlier art and jewelry. Well-written . . . a good, and beautiful, addition to learning about Native American lives and art.Evelyn WinkelSeal Beach, CA"
1,Looks like childs play.,"The inlay work it not that good, I've seen better inlay work. Looks like his copying art work from someone else."
1,Good pictures,"People who buy Monongya's expensive and well crafted baubles will love this book. Publicity can enhance their investment. The rest of us will have to make do with what could have been a good story. Instead, Dubin turns old stereotypes into sappy tales in text better suited to perfume ads in glossy magazines. She tosses in some translated Navajo prayers. Her biased view gets in the way of what might be a good story about a person living between two cultures, if only she had looked more perceptively into the subject.One star: for the good photos. C C, Santa Fe"
5,Polymer Chemistry 2nd ed by Hiemenz and Lodge,"This 2nd edition is nearly a total rewrite. The fine structure of the first edition is greatly strengthened by the most recent advances in polymer science and crystal clear explanations of the important phenomena, especially in polymer physics. Worked exercises and challenging homework problems aid student learning. I have used all the major texts to teach introductory polymer science to seniors and also graduate students in chemical engineering, materials science, chemistry and biomedical engineering. Hiemenz and Lodge is the clearly the best.Polymer Chemistry, Second Edition"
3,Too wordy,"This book of Paul Hiemenz' could have been almost halved without detriment to its content. I would not point this out if the language were engaging, but it is not."
4,good book,"It is arrived in time in a foam envelope, and there was a notch on the side of the book's cover, but it do not affect the use of it"
2,"Loved the recording, mixed feelings about the score","Hal Leonard really has no right to call this book the ""complete"" score because it is in many ways incomplete. In fact, I think it would better be described as a quasi-condensed score because there is no indication of which instrument plays which line of the staff and many times the music that the horn and vocal parts play are notated on one line in condensed form. I love The Way Up, it's my favorite Pat Metheny album and it features some of his most intense guitar solos, and yet the score leaves every one of them out. Most of the reason I was excited to have this book was because I hoped it would have transcriptions of his solos, but alas, nothing but four dashes per measure. Maybe if I were a guitarist I would see this as a challenge and take it upon myself to learn and transcribe it by ear, but I am not. I am just sorely disappointed.Don't buy this book unless you're looking for transcription homework."
5,Turn of the screw,This whold CD is awesome. Not too many people have heard of this band but if you like one of their songs. You will like this whole CD. It was a good piece of work from them. Dont hesitate buy it.
5,I learned a lot!,"All of the basics of getting your sound to your audience in an easy-to-read . . .and understand . . .format. I've been doing live music performance for 30+ years, and thought I knew what I was doing. I do much better now. I recommend this book to anyone who uses a PA system, or places speakers, or builds speaker cabinets, or performs with amplification."
4,Works great,This product works perfect for our company as we have tried other ones in the past that don't hold up.
2,"Licks seem ""inauthentic""","I agree with the reviewer who described many of the licks as ""blah."" Having purchased videos/books by Johnny Hiland, Doug Seven, Danny Gatton, and Red Volkaert, as well as this one, I noticed that the majority of the licks in this book do not seem ""authentic,"" comparatively speaking. While constructed from the proper scales and utilizing common chicken pickin techniques such as open strings and bends, they lack the sound and feel that are idiomatic of the genre; some are rather sterile sounding. There are even some offerings of wide intervallic licks and string skipping licks, which to me sounds more at home with jazz fusion or metal. The bending licks do not have the ""pedal steel"" feel to them. Most importantly, there are no indications on which notes of the licks should either be plucked or picked - this is crucial, since this technique is what gives this style its very name...."
3,North American version,"This is a cute toy,but it doesn't do much. Buyers should know that it is the North American version, which is worth much less than the Japanese version. There are also bootleg versions from Hong Kong to watch out for. Anyways, the ring is removable and the staff makes noise- comes with batteries. These are still not UNcommon. I got mine for $10 shipped in 2008."
1,Waste of money,"I was initially excited about this game for the shower, but it proved to be a flop! Only two of the guests were able to use the scratch off portion. We used nails, coins, pencils. Very disappointing, don't wate your money!"
2,It's like reading a boring textbook.,"I'm terrible with my grammar, I was hoping this would help me improve it, however, I was dissapointed. First of all I had trouble using the software with windows XP, turns-out I needed to run it using Windows98/XP setting in order for it to work.The software itself lacks visual aids. There are no pictures or videos, only texts. The music and sound effects are annoying, but you can turn it off. The software has a section called ""now it's your turn,"" in which they ask you a bunch of questions, but provide no answers, to confirm your own. To sum it all up, it's basically a poorly writen E-Book, your better off buying a book on grammar."
3,could be better,i've been using this product for a while now. the first thing to go was the belt itself. i got a higher quality police grade belt to use. the comfort padding is great. dont spend alot on it. i use mine with the suspenders and its a great tool belt setup.
1,Betty Crocker Diabetes Cookbook,"Nothing at all wrong with the finished food. But the book is only good if you are rich and have plenty of time to shop. The women who presented the meals obviously fit into both categories. If they were just regular people (like the name, Betty Crocker, is supposed to represent) they would not have said that these are quick and easy to prepare."
2,Another Promotional Product From A Major Corporation Perhaps?,"This book attempts to show how diabetics can control their diet and work toward wellness by cooking(?). The nature of cooking is explained way too much without giving the reader any information about diabetes as a disease. As I was going through the information in the book about diabetes, I felt like I was sitting in the FIRST GRADE. Not recommended. A far better choice is 'Diabetes and You: A Comprehensive, Holistic Approach'. Save your money and get a book on diabetes written for GROWNUPS."
5,Terrific for diabetics and everybody else!,"My husband was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes several years ago, and I have been struggling to come up with meal plans that we can both enjoy ever since. Most diabetic cookbooks have recipes that are mediocre at best - and wretched at worst. Not so with this little gem! We recieved this as a gift - and we have cooked at least half of the recipes in the book - and have not hit a bad one yet. In fact, it has rapidly become our ""go to"" cookbook because the recipes are tasty, are generally quick to prepare (we both work so this attribute is critical), and utilize stuff we generally have in the pantry - not many ""exotic"" ingredients. The meals are seasoned wonderfully - and we BOTH enjoy them. Check it out - you won't be disappointed! We love to cook - and were a little suspect when we saw the ""Betty Crocker"" label - assuming it would be full of ""hamburger casserole - type"" recipes - but it's not!"
2,Disappointing,"Maybe I have too many cook books, but I didn't find this any different than any other book that gives nutritional breakdowns. Many of the recepies had too many carbs &/or fats. Among other things, I was hoping for interesting ways to make diabetic cookies and other goodies without fruit. Many of the ingredients are not available in ordinary stores. I found it ho hum and not worth the price."
5,Great resource,This cookbook gives great help to a novice cook learning to cook more diabetes friendly!
4,cook book,this book had a lot of very good recipes. And the book was filled with pictures which is helpful when trying to determine which recipe to try first.
4,Betty Crocker Diabetes Cookbook,"Bought this for my mom. She has a hard time keeping up with what to eat and what not to eat. She says this cookbook is great. For the recipes they use ingredients you probably have on hand. Most cookbooks for diabetes require you to buy extra ingredients, not normally on hand. She loves it!!!"
2,A little misleading....,"My biggest beef with this book is that they really don't differentiate between the different types of diabetes: type 1, type 1.5, and type 2. Type 1 and 2 diabetes are very different, and I felt the the book didn't clearly state the target audience for their recipes."
1,sugary recipes!?!? SO dissapointed,"I am deeply disappointed in this book. While the information section in the front is informative and well written, there is nothing special about these recipes. I bought this because I cannot have sugar. This book glosses over the seriousness of diabetic diet by suggesting that everyone can eat sugar in moderation and then provides recipes including ""carmalized-garlic chicken"" which contains two teaspoons packed brown sugar and double-ginger cookies with 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup molasses.If you also can't have sugar and you're looking for a cookbook in which 100% of the recipes are good for you, buy the sugar busters cookbook.Sugar Busters! Quick & Easy Cookbookor the candida control cookbookThe Candida Control Cookbook: What You Should Know and What You Should Eat to Manage Yeast Infections (New Revised & Updated Edition)which offers vegetable glycerin sweetened recipes."
2,How to cook with diabetes,This is a step by step book on what and how to cook with diabetes. It gives you foods you should eat day by day and menus for a 10 week period. I was disappointed as I wanted just a cook book for diabetics. My husband and I have been diabetics for years and we just wanted more recipes.
5,Good Diabetic eating,I found this to be one of the best resources for recipes for diabetics. The recipes were easy to follow-not to fancy-every day food. The carb count was well within the ADA standards. I would highly recomend it for new diabetics and for those people counting carbs on their diets.
3,Not Exactly What I Needed,"This is a good cookbook with good information but a lot of the recipes use ingredients that I can't use as they are unavailable in our area or very expensive. Having diabetes is expensive on its own and the food should be simple and easy to put together. Diabetes takes a lot of time to manage and when you are just beginning with the process and looking for help - this is not the book for you. Perhaps after things have settled down and I am more used to dealing with diabetes, it will more useful. If you want truly unique recipes, try this. If you want ordinary food that is good for you, try something else."
2,cookbook let-down,"The book was not at all what I had hoped. I thought it would give me some new reciepes for Diabetics, but these were all regular reciepes that I could have gotten from any other Betty Crocker Book. I would have to serve the food with instructions to eat less than half a cup if you are diabetic. Disappointment was all I got for my money. I will probably give the book away to someone who does not have diabetes."
3,Betty Crocker's Diabetes Cookbook,Excellent - does a good job with carb choices and recipes are easy and as in the title everyday - excellent for the newly diagnosed.
4,Betty Crocker's Diabetes Cookbook,"This book makes it easy to come up with different foods to cook. With three diabetics in the house it is sometimes difficult to come up with new things to eat, including deserts. This book solves that problem."
4,"Good book, some recipes seem to have a lot of carbs","This is a good book. However, some of the recipes seem to have a lot of carbs. I know that a certain amount of fiber (5 Grams I think) can be subtracted from the carbs, but some are high in carbs and still low in fiber. I chose to make a few of these recipes and served a salad or high fiber vegetables on the side."
2,Missing pages,I gave this cookbook a 2 star because there were missing pages. Pages.113-128 were missingn otherwise it could have been 4 star cookbook. Too much trouble to send back.
5,Great book with good recipes.,I have tried 4 meals and they all turned out very very good. I cannot wait till try another recipe!
3,The 30 Day Diabetes Miracle is more helpful in controlling blood sugar!,"I highly recommend the 30-Day Diabetes Miracle series for managing your diabetes and creating a whole new healthy lifestyle!The 30-Day Diabetes Miracle: Lifestyle Center of America's Complete Program to Stop Diabetes, Restore Health,and Build Natural VitalityThe 30-Day Diabetes Miracle Cookbook: Stop Diabetes with an Easy-to-Follow Plant-Based, Carb-Counting Diet"
1,Betty Crocker's Diabetes Cookbook: Everyday Meals,"Tremendous service,,,,,,,,,,excellent! Thanks.N. White"
5,Love this book!,I have several diabetic cookbooks and this is my favorite. I love the double berry muffins! My husband is thrilled with his new diabetic options. Easy to follow and well organized.
5,Brilliant!,Just finding out I have type 2 diabetes I wanted to do the 'right' thing. I looked at lots of different books but decided on the Betty Crockers Diabetes Cookbook. It is full of really helpfull information on diabetes as well as all the great recipies. Very colourful and shows that you can still enjoy lots of good food!100% pleased with the book.
4,Good Buy,"I bought this for someone who can't see or hear well. It's great, all he has to do is hit the big button!"
2,Had to return it,"Bought this clock for my 92 year old mother who has macular degeneration and is hard of hearing. She is in an assisted living facility and gets confused as to whether it is 5 a.m. or 5 p.m. She could not understand the time, it should be much louder and much clearer. It sounded like just noise to her. She was unable to make out even one word of the message. Am still looking for something with various volume controls so that she can hear it."
2,clock review,"this is the clock I really wanted, but it no longer crows on the alarm. Sent it back. They have replaced with another style. Not as easy to operate as first item."
1,"This item was not in ""new"" condition as listed!","I am very disappointed with this item. Listed as ""new,"" this item arrived with a black line across the pages, written with permenant marker. Altough a line like this is acceptable for personal use, I bought this item as a gift and now feel uncomfortable because it looks like it was used.Please do not list items as ""new"" if they are not in fact ""new."""
1,Calling this movie bad is an insult to bad movies.,"Selecting to view the film, Rottweiler, as it features a half cyborg killer dog in it may reflect poorly on my taste in films. Be that as it may, Rottweiler makes a key mistake in my opinion by focusing on the humans in the film. It is set in the future and the Spanish prisons apparently have cyborg hunter dogs as part of their retrieval teams for escapees. Rather than follow the hapless ""Dante"" on his often al fresco journey across Spain, featuring incomprehensible flashbacks and odd one dimensional characters, why not more of an examination of the dog? The movie is titled Rottweiler. It might be interesting to know how the dog was created or changed. The runtime says 97 minutes but it feels much longer. Go with ""Man's Best Friend"" or ""Cujo"" if you want psycho dogs. A thoroughly disappointing effort."
2,One of the worst films...it's an insult to the dog to have to be in it!,"I watched this with my dad the other night. This movie is so stupid, no words can describe it. The plot is worthless and has no point. It doesn't fully explain what's really going on. I should have relized the movie was going to be horrible when it's only 10 minutes in and two people have died and he's already escaped. They also did a horrible attempt on making the dog look real. In about half the movie, it's a real dog but when it's not, it looks so fake it's unbelievable. Besides, a lot fo the people in this movie have no common sense at all. It's a good idea to create a vicious half dog and half robot pooch that's used to track down prison escapees but come on! This movie? This is the best you can do?I think the movie deserves only one star but I gave it an extra one because the dog (when it's a real dog) is awesome! I love the rottie's ice blue eyes."
1,"Good idea, bad movie.","This's one of those ""Hey, that sounds cool! No... Wait... This sucks!"" kinda of movies. The idea of a Terminator Dog is, indeed cool. But the so-called hero is someone we'd all like to see fed to ""Rott"". He deserves to be killed, not made the hero of the movie... Rott should've been the hero of the movie. That would've made it at least watchable..."
4,Good starter set for learning Italian,"Although the information in the disk is wonderful, I found that actor/actress were not in sinc with the words they were saying. Made it difficult to see the proper way to say the words.My son and I both have greatly enjoyed and learned alot from this CDROM set."
2,"Fun game, never a complete course","Learn Italian Express should be sold as a fun pastime and not as a language course. You will learn some concepts. You will never be able to learn a language with this. Not even know to say a couple of sentences in a given situation. But it's an entertaining way to spend some of your leisure time finding out about some basic concepts of another language, one as lovely as Italian."
5,If You Prefer A Tablet Form....,"I prefer my vitamin products in either tablet form or enclosed in veggie capsule. I avoid gelatin capsules wheneverI am able to do so. I'll take my animal on a plate if I wish to do so, not in a capsule.THe Nature Made product meets the requirements I am looking for,which in this case also includes the type of vitamin D I want (D3), and the strength I want (1000 IU)."
4,Pure Poetry,Catching up on my Amazon reviews (only about 300 books behind)---been a big fan of Millay since my first reading of Renascence (a favorite poem). Millay was a personality before there were magazines and 24/7 coverage of a celebrities every move---no doubt she would have been good fodder for these purveyors of the lives of others. Ms. Millay lived on the edge and her talent was equalled by a life lived large. Mr. Epstein captured this exceptionally woman beautifully in his well-written biography.Highly recommended.
4,Two for the price of one,"I mainly got this cd because I wanted the songs ""I Collect Hearts"" and ""Mr. Winchester's Gun"". It also, has a few other popular songs by other people. Only, reason I gave this four out of five is because it was suppose to get to me sooner, but it was shipped from England. Sooo, I had to wait several more weeks for this cd. For all of you that haven't heard of this singer he has a really deep voice and he was Billy's father from Gremlins."
2,"Cute, Compact, Doesn't Turn Properly at All!!","This is cute and folds up very small and compact.... but it is nearly impossible to turn. It is so hard! If you've got one hand full and need to turn it with the other, forget it. My mom recently strolled it for a few minutes while I got some food at the mall.. she couldn't believe it!"
5,Great for Kids,I really like this version of the Bible... the English used is simple and easy for kids to understand. My 7 year-old loves it!
5,Hands on Bible,Bible in great condition. Was delivered very fast. Wanted it for a Christmas gift and received it in plenty of time. The child that received it loved it so much and will be using it in Sunday school and Awanas. Thanks so much for this product:):):):)
3,Too many distractions,"The NLT is a good Bible translation for this age group, but the pictures, text boxes and activity pages distract from the Scripture. It's not bad for a beginner, if there's some question about wanting to read the Bible, but for someone who actually does want to read it, the other stuff gets in the way. Even our 10-year-old now prefers to use other Bibles, as he has trouble looking up references because of the distractions.A sturdy NLT without all of the extraneous material would be a better choice, and would probably wear better, as it would be lighter and thinner."
2,Understand what you are picking out.,I didn't understand what NLT-NT mean't and so I didn't get both the old and new testament but just the New Testament-hence NT.
5,An excellent interpretation of the Word of God,"Originally, this book was a gift for my grandson by one of his elementary school teachers--ordered on Amazon.com. I started reading the book and could not put it down. Because we live in separate housing, I realized that I wanted this book for my own. Even if you have spiritual interpretation of the scriptures, this book explains the scriptures in layman's terms for today. Try The Hands On Bible for yourself and you will realize the truth that is magnificently displayed. You, as well as, your children will have a clear understanding of so many things that we have been so ignorant of."
5,God will heal the land,"it is such a beautiful song i really love it, it is so very inspiration of true words about god.The almighty god will do as he said. The song was written very spiritually on solid ground of truth faith and diginity . And also share's the true meaning of the lord thy god."
5,exactly as described,the book was noted to have pen marks and be worn out a bit. Describe perfectly. Arrived on time and promptly.
3,Just alright,This movie was filmed very ghetto. I think an amature could have done a better job. The pole tricks were good but the video was not impressive at all. It looks like it was filmed at a random store. I am a bit disappointed with this film. I probably won't purchase another one of these videos.
2,Not what I thought I was purchasing,"The video showed several moves, and over half of them were not for beginners.It was extremely low budget, and did not have any music to accompany it.I was really hoping to learn tricks and moves, but also how to do transitions and put them into a routine. This DVD does NOT in any way do that. It shows clips that move on from one to another, never putting them into a routine.I would not recommend this, and I am currently shopping for a different DVD"
2,not bad,"dont expect the greatest quality. a little cheezy, but takes it slow. learned a lot, but it has no music so it gets boring"
2,Not what I expected,"I'm a beginner at pole dancing. I wanted to have a detailed video with basic moves, transitions, etc, but I also wanted to see routines. After all, it is pole dancing, not aerobics. The video was a little too clinical and didn't have as many types as moves as I wanted. It's OK as part of the library, but you need to suppelment with others."
2,not entailed enough for all levels,This is an alright video. I am a beginner at this with some dance experience. This is not a very detailed video they show a couple of move and that was it. I had hoped for a lot more of the lesson part.
1,pamela anderson calendar,Was not happy with the quality of the pictures. Looked like someone photocopied them and made them into a calendar. I wouldn't purchase this!
4,Still working,"I've had this one a while, and NiCads seem to hold up better than NiMH's. Not as much capacity but better for occasional use, as it is much more likely to still have charge after a week or two off the charger."
1,Implant City,"Almost all of these women are fake. Some beautiful faces and other features ruined by implants (as well as tattoos, piercings, ...). One natural beauty in the extras. (The Wal-Mart collection was almost all good; the McDonald's was half worthwhile.) Recommended only for those who like plastic."
3,They work on MySpace? Are you sure?,"Being a playboy product, you know the images will be clear and well focused, the models beautiful, and the sets adequate if not ravishing. What you can also predict is that the film will have a detached air about it that precludes the viewer from feeling any emotion ties to the on screen action, so that you see basically a slide show of pretty pictures and nothing more.As in any ""the girls of"" feature, you have to wonder if these women really work on the website or if they are 'ringers' brought in for a photo shoot. You're right...who cares..."
5,Where body meets mind meets spirit ...,"I am delighted to now have a book available to use myself and recommend to clients which synthesizes the domains of somatics, linguistics and health. Matthew describes our teacher, Richard Heckler Ph.D., as an ""exemplar of the qualities of teachership"", and Matthew is himself an exemplar of the ""consilience thinking"" he describes, transforming the sometimes dense and difficult material of Flores and Maturana [two of our foremost thinkers] into a readable and enjoyable book. I highly recommend this book for psychotherapists, coaches and anyone interested in personal growth."
5,The greatest hit ever!,"This is the best song I have ever heard. The lyrics are just perfect and the music video is the coolest. A-Teens' moves are the best! This is a cd that deserves more than 5 stars. To me, even though A-Teens ""copied"" Dancing Queen, it sounds better than the original one by ABBA. This song deserves to be on all the pop radio stations.The band also has a variety of singers. Marie and Sara, who are obvious that they are girls, and Dhani and Amit, who are boys. This made the single so good, because each of their voices are different."
4,dancing queen,I think this song is good but not the greatest. every time I hear this song it gets stuck in my head.This song makes me want to get up and dance. I like it and all but its not the best
1,Waste of CD materials,I saw A teens music video dancing queens on TV and I couldn't even watch the whole thing. This is without a doubt the worst music I have ever heard. The lyrics are just stupid and [so is] the whole theme of the song. I would pay any amount of money to never have to listen to this [stuff] again.
3,Pretty Good ...for the 1960s,"This book is a classic, and if you are seriously interested in the history of U.S. higher education, you can't get around it. But it's also forty years old. Like most major works on the history of U.S. higher education, it pretends that the North East and Mid West can speak authoritatively for the rest of the country. The book is therefore quite incomplete, which should be taken into account when reading it. Check out John Thelin's 2004 History of American Higher Education, it's much more up-to-date and comprehensive."
5,Very good Toaster Oven - Great Looking and Performing,I am a 28 year old bachelor that can honestly careless about name brands of appliances. I read the reviews and people mentioned names I have never heard of. This Cuisinart Toaster Oven is one heck of a unit that I took a gamble on.I replaced a really old Sunbeam hand-me-down with this unit. I can't be happier with it. It cooks very even and very efficiently. It heats up extremely fast which is a huge plus. The other toaster ovens I have had took forever to heat up.The looks on this toaster is absolutely stunning. I purchased the refurbished one and there was no way to tell it was refurbished. The exterior was flawless. Everyone who has been in my town home has commented on how nice it looks in the kitchen.Thanks amazon for a perfect product.
3,Factory Refurbished Cuisinart Toaser oven,"My toaster oven works great, other than the oven door, which is a little hard to open and close. Also, there was a little chip on the inside of the glass on the door. Other than that, the oven looks nice, and works great. It was definitely worth the savings."
4,Very good quality,"I bought this unit to replace a 5 year old Kenmore which was great at first, but over time took longer and longer to toast, and finally the oven function died. This unit is well-constructed, functions fine( toasts much faster than the Kenmore)and looks nice in the chrome finish. The only surprise, compared to my other one, was no timer on the oven function. So far no hint of problems with it being reconditioned, which do usually show up very quickly."
3,Pretty good toaster,"Works well, very large capacity.The functions could be better thought out the way there are 3 dials, but it's not a big deal.One of the nobs broke, but cuisinart did replace it for free... although they send the wrong color."
3,First one returned,"Bought one, had to return it because toaster was not functioning properly. Second one is okay. Only worth it if ""price is right."""
1,Unfortunately defective,"This toaster oven looks nice but after I unpacked it, read the owner's manual, plugged it in and tried to toast a piece of bread, it wouldn't toast or even get hot. I've ordered a replacement because I think it would be a great unit...if it worked. Amazon's return policy is courteous, which I appreciate."
2,"Item is okay, but ...","I expected to see the trip that started in Chicago (or Oakland) and ended in Oakland (or Chicago), without cutting in to interviewing people, and various scenes. I have another California Zephyr video, and that one takes you to the beginning of this great ride starting at the Chicago station, through Denver, Reno, the Sierras, and ending in the Bay Area.If you rather see a video like I just described, buy that one. Otherwise, I would not buy this video (CA Zephyr Silver Thread Through the West) at all. I would hope to find an Amtrak video that starts at Denver's Union Station and end in Grand Junction. The train ride traverses the Colorado River there."
2,"Book is ok, not what I expected but ok.","I have been collecting books about 911, thought this would be a good addition to my collection but was sadly disappointed"
1,Ace Ventura JR,"Wow, who thought in Hollywood this would be a good idea? The movie ignores Ace Ventura SR for most of this dreadful film, hinting at him briefly. Then out of the blue, it's revealed that he is lost in the Bremuda triangle. The kid playing JR is a bad actor and shouldn't get anther role in Hollywood. The whole movie is just a mess with bad acting, bad camera work, and just a slap in the face to fans of the orignal film. Stay away from this, I saw it for free just to witness the train wreck."
1,Grandchildren would not finish movie,"When my grandchildren will not finish a movie, it's BAD and they bailed in 15 minutes or less on this one."
2,Not the worst thing ever but close!,"This was an ok idea, but done all wrong. If they HAD to make an Ace Ventura movie without Jim Carrey they should have made a prequel! They could have used an actor who resembled Jim (Actually Trevor Moore from ""Miss March"" would be perfect, as he looked and dressed like Ace in that film!). Even this film should have found a kid that looked more like Jim/Ace! This kid would make a better kid version of Seth from ""Superbad"" than the son of Ace Ventura! While not as awful as some have said, this movie isn't worth more than a $1 Redbox rent & rip!"
3,Don't drop these batteries,I have no problem with the battery life or charge time. But dropped on concrete the housing shattered. I've put it together with tape but suspect that the OEM products have a tougher shell.
4,interesting,"I read this book after the movie ""Ray"" came out. I enjoyed the book a lot, but found there were a few things that he talks about that were portrayed differently in the movie, so I wondered which were true. I was a little surprised at how honest he is in the book about his womanizing and lack of interest in birth control or whether his casual encounters would result in contracting STD's. He was an amazing man and musician, and I admire his talent, but was a little disappointed at his lack of morals in a lot of cases. I wonder how his dear mama would have felt about it, if she had lived to see his adult life. The book is a great read and very insightful into Ray Charles's life, he leaves no stone unturned."
3,Charles,"I dislike Charles because it didnt catch my attension.It was not a really good bookI think.The best partof book I read was when Charles kick the teachers friend because he got mad at the teachers friend.Charles did alot of bad things in this book.he also through chalk at kids.The setting of charlesbasically was atcharles schoolin the 1990s but also his friend house and the charcters to this story was charles hi friend ,his friends my dad & mom,the princapal,teacher and teachers friend."
4,Quite Interesting,"I'm a musicians' biography nut, so I had to buy this, despite hardly knowing any of Ray's material beforehand.It was written by a fan who hounded Ray Charles for months for the permission to write his biography. Once Ray said yes, the author got to hang out with his idol for months of nightly interviews before writing the book, and they eventually became friends. It's written in a colloquial, personal style that's supposed to reflect the way Ray talks, so the book is kind of like a one-on-one with Ray himself - like you're having a beer with the guy. It gets pretty raunchy - the syndrome of Too Much Information. I didn't mind it, tho' it was a tad jarring to hear about his masturbation contests, and the language does get earthy, but I suppose it all helps to size up the subject matter into a real enough image, which is what reading the book is for in the first place.Overall a good read."
4,Oh yeah,"""The most clear-eyed and honest celebrity autobiography I've read.""That back cover blurb, by somebody famous I've never heard of, is exactly right, including some details I'd probably omit from my own autobiography. What makes this book wonderful is, as you'd expect, Ray's voice. You've heard it in his music, and now you can read it in his book. I highly recommend it."
5,"A GREAT, QUICK, FUN READ!","In my eyes, Zane has redeemed herself! I loved ""Addicted....;"" who didn't? Yet I'd almost convinced myself that it was a ""one hit wonder....."" I haven't really enjoyed any of her other work. This novel, however, proves that Zane is here to stay!Here is a sort of sexually-oriented Cinderella story--the homely, backward country girl arrives in the Chocolate City...; meets the street-smart city girl who dresses her up, takes her out, and introduces her to living a life without sexual inhibitions. I thought the dialogue was well-done and completely believable, the characters fun, and the storyline great. I loved the creativity, yet simplicity of this book.Fun,creative and imaginiative....Zane gets a gold star from me."
1,More Tawdry Tales,Zane's work has taken a definite turn for the worst. Consider the title of this one.Overly graphic language and predictable plots are no substitutefor character development and vision. Zane has elected to gowith the lowest common denominator and turn a fast buck. It'sneither cute nor classy.
4,Girls just want to have fucks,"Zane appeals to girls who like sex, aggressively seek it, and love it! If you're a girl like that--or think you might want to be one--Zane is your guide. Enjoy the ride!"
2,Not her best,"I read this, but I truly wasn't feeling it. I felt the storyline had great potential, but it wasn't as exciting as I thought it would have been. Addicted is still my favorite of her novels, and I believe it's because there was more than one storyline happening. There was intrigue. The best word for me to describe APF is ""flat."""
1,Waste of good trees,"I'm familiar with Zane's writings, so I knew what to expect as far as the erotica was concerned, but this poor book was a waste of good trees. The writing and the story were too simplistic for my taste. Even the 'erotica' was boring. If you're looking to kill a few hours on something mindless, this might work for you."
2,It was alright,"I was going to buy this book, but a co-worker/friend of mine bought it instead, so I borrowed it from her and read it. I'm glad I did, cause the book was alright, it wasn't fascinating or really good where I would be like ""damn, I gotta buy me a copy"". I know that she has another new book based on one of her short stories called ""Nervous"". If I can borrow that book and read it I will. I won't be buying another Zane book. I think that she needs to slow down with her sex books. Because after awhile it's repeatative."
2,ZANE GOT SOFT!,"I am a very big fan of Zane and own all her books. However, I feel that this is not one of her best works. After reading sex chronicles 1 & 2 I expected more ......something!! Overall it was an o.k read but not what I was expecting. Especially from Zane"
5,A lover of Zane's Work,This book brings it all together. I mean Damn it was off the damn hook. My girls at work and I started our own little book club because of Zane. She just let's it all out in all of her books. If you loved the Sex Cronicle's you'll love this.
5,TOO Hot!!,"Whew! This book definitely lives up to Zane's reputation for producing pieces that are hot and steamy and provide a sure-fire escape for the sista reading it. The Sisters of APF is about a sorority that isn't concerned about stepping, cat-calls or pledging. This sisterhood is all about sex, although they do have an investment club on the side. The sistas in this book have taken women's liberation to a whole `nother level. This book is a quick read and is a great ""escape"" book. I recommend it to those of us who think we might be ""intimately repressed"" and to us ""liberated girls."" Both groups are sure to learn something new! Kristy- Sister 2 Sister Book Club Founding Member"
2,I'm a self-imposed ZANE fan...,"...and I LOVE her work. But I'm sorry this book sucked to the high heavens. I'm going to keep it REAL...the character development in this book was WEAK, very weak. And the storyline...well let me just say Zane did a MUCH better job with the short story of the same title in Sex Chronicles.Yet another book to be used in my fireplace..."
3,Zane has done better,"This book was about a country girl that goes to college in the ""big city"" and is exposed to a new lifestyle...a secret sorority. This is a spin off from one on Zane's stories in the first Sex Chronicles book. It was okay...I think her other books (Addicted, Shame on it all, Heatseekers) were better. This one seemed to drag on."
5,This is a great read!!!,I enjoyed this book so much. I read it in less than two hours. Zane is a terrific writer. I loved the main character's resolve in getting in touch with her sexual self. I read Addicted and enjoyed it immensely. Zane does not dissappoint and I am looking forward to more great works from her. You have a follower in me!
3,IT WAS A DRAG!!,THIS BOOK WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A DRAG!! IT WAS INTERESTING AT THE BEGGINING BUT THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW SORROR RIDE D### WAS JUST A PREDICTABLE PERSON. I THINK THAT THIS BEING A ZANE BOOK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SEDUCTIVE BUT TO EACH IT'S OWN.
4,Great,I loved the book for it borught one of the characters of her short story book t o life and made her inferior to anyone who challenged her demeanor. I can't wait untill she comes out with more
2,Not all it's Cracked up to be,"This was the first book I read by Zane. It was an easy read, but you have got to want to read a book that is all about sexual enticing fantasies. I really wanting to read a Zane book, however I wasn't that interested in this one. This book is very provocative, and has more sex, then story or plot. If you like Zane , then I'm sure you will like this book, I was Kind of dissappointed with the Sisters of APF."
2,Not like the usual Zane books,"While the subject matter is off the hook, this book was somewhat dissapointing to me. I did not have a hard time reading it but, it was not as enjoyable as some of Zane's other novels."
2,Tell me where my money went,"This book didn't even begin in a promising manner, which is why I am amazed I finished it. Sex sells but story keeps people interested and this book has no story. The characters aren't developed, the potential conflicts fizzle before they get off the ground and the sex scenes lack passion. I truly can't tell what this story was supposed to be. Cautionary tale? Memoir? Beach drama? Part of an unfinished series? I gave two stars because the author spared me the typical ""urban"" ending and everyone lived at the ending."
2,Very Disappointing Read,"O.K. Where do I start with this book? First of all, it has no real meaning. It does not talk about the actual sorority that much at all. The whole book is about a girl that's just getting to know this guy and they go through their ups and downs. Then she meets this girl that lives across the hall from her that she starts to just hang with to have fun. That's mainly all the book is about. It's not about an actual sorority. It was nothing like I thought it was going to be. However, it is a fast read. Definitely not Zane's best but I guess you can't get it right every single time. I will not give up on you, Zane."
3,good,"this book is good and very erotic (like everything Zane represents). i like the idea of a soroity devoted to sexy, classy, educated, hard-working women, who wanna get their rage off, and have complete control over therselves and their men. i love it because it's different and more creative from any other book. however, i don't like the fact that these woman have boyfriends and husbands. STD's are extreme and they didn't cover anyone in the book having caught one or being afraid of one or pregnancy. that's not realistic. this book is mainly saying, do it to whoever, whenever, however, just use a condom??!!! sorry boo, but condoms are not even 90% safe. so i feel she should've made it more realistic like her other books."
4,A Page Turner,"This book is hot, if your looking for a soft porn, this is the book 4 you. O but I wouldn't be reading this alone.The things that these women in this sorority experience. Thats what I'm talking about. This book teaches women that we have to learn what we like 1st b4 we can please any1 else. Zane has done it again."
2,Decent,Not her best but APF was a decent book...The women did use condomn in their sexcapades which was good..Not only were they freaky but smart as well.
3,What Happened,I'm a big fan of Zane and I picked this book up as soon as it hit the store but what happened?? I was not pleased with this book but I guess Nervous made up for it. Don't waste your time on this book!
5,TALK ABOUT OFF THE HOOK....THIS IS THE BEST ONE YET....,"OF HER ACTUAL NOVELS THIS IS THE BEST ONE YET. THIS ONE DIDNT START SLOW LIKE ADDICTED OR HEETSEEKERS. THIS ONE HAD MY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION FROM THE START TO FINISH.... IT TOOK ME 2 DAYS TO FINISH BUT THATS ONLY BECAUSE I HAD AN ACCOUNTING EXAM, A GEOLOGY FINAL AND HAD TO GIVE TIME 2 MY KIDS, BUT IF YOU DONT HAVE ANY OUTSIDE DISTRACTIONS THIS IS AN EASY READY IN A DAY... DEFINITELY NEED TO ADD TO YOUR READING LIBRARY."
3,Just okay,"Typical ghetto novella. Unimpressed with the characters, and the constant references to ho'ing being justified as a form of sexual freedom. As professional as the ladies of the APF profess to be I wonder what kind of conscious the average woman would have as they think back on what a cum dump they allowed themselves to be."
5,Wish They Had This In College,"Zane's tale of a shy and meek college girl going to college would have any parent holding onto their daughters just a little bit tighter. I must admit that they didn't have this type of sorority when I was going to school, at least I was never asked to join. The images conjured up as well as the places in which the events took place were vivid. Zane has quiet the imagination and shares all in this too hot to put down novel."
2,Not all TV version arrangements,"Very poor. Not all are the originl arrangements used on TV. Cagney and Lacey is not a patch on the original, sounds like someones recorded it from their bedroom. Rhino did not do their research."
3,Left a good one out,This is a good collection but I was really disappointed that the theme from Hunter was left out. It was a great cop show with a great theme.
3,"Okay, but......","I have used Lonely Planet guides for many years,but unlike the reviewer of July 3 1998 I wouldn't automatically regard them as the best, especially in a country as large as Canada. I recently traveled through western Canada and found this book to be relatively up to date, but way too brief in most areas and catering almost exclusively to budget travelers. I also had with me the British Columbia Handbook and Alberta Handbook by Andrew Hempstead and found them to fill the gaps with a good selection of places to stay and eat as well as hiking and all the best things to see and do (and there's lots of that-plan to spend as much time as possible in Canada) from someone who lives there. In addition to these two books, many more books are available in Canada to each region and Canadians love reading so there are bookstores in every town. If you are hitchhiking across Canada, the Lonely Planet book is the one, if you want more detailed information stick to the Moon books."
3,Mike,Ok item but magnets are pretty wimpy. If your flat welding on a table they would probably work well. Dont expect to do any free welding and use the magnets to hold any thing. I use them to hold the leather shield on fenders while welding around painted items. They work ok for that but so would a old speaker magnet.
4,USB Floppy fulfills floppy need for computers without the floppy.,"Very compact, very easy to connect (USB) and to use. Allows use of legacy floppies on floppyless machines. Far easier and cheaper than transferring legacy floppies to CD. Many of my spreadsheets and docs fit very nicely on a floppy, and floppies are actually easier to haul around than CD's."
5,Great shampoo!,My husband and I have been searching for a shampoo that will not dry out our lab's skin. This shampoo works great and it lathers up well! It does not dry skin out and smells great. We will definitely buy again.
1,Average read,"Written by an Australian author, this book does not work well in the US market. Lots of what the author has written can be found in better books like Games Trainers Play and so on. It is pitched very low and doesn't cater for the sophisticated learning specialist. Buy something else."
3,"Interesting, but...","This is a reprint of a book originally published in 1890. So one expects that some of the things in it may have been superseded as more study has occurred. But that is not its problem, as we are talking about a subject that was rather thoroughly explored even back then. The real problem is that it expects the reader to be able fluently to read a number of different alphabets (or syllabaries): at least four different scripts (Amharic, Arabic, Hebrew/Aramaic, and Syriac), only transliterating some, but not all, of the words and phrases used as examples. I am pretty well conversant with the Hebrew script, especially as the examples generally have vowel points, but cannot make head or tail of the others, so the usefulness is limited -- where transliterations are provided, fine, but otherwise, I'm at a loss.So let the reader be warned."
4,Sultry session from London soars,"This two albums on one CD set finds Julie London at her sultriest and steamiest. Sophisticated Lady, 1962, contains wonderful versions of Remind Me and Make it Another Old Fashioned Please as well as London's hubby-penned (Bobby Troup) Where Am I to Go. For The Night People, 1966, scores with Am I Blue, Mercer's Dream and Here's That Rainy Day. It's wonderful to have these recordings available."
5,Great,"This was an assigned text, but very good. This book speaks biblically about the importance of holiness in the life of a Christian. I have had the privilage of studying under Fred Moritz and can warmly reccomend what he has written. This book does well at presenting the importance of holiness to God and to His people."
5,Best compilation yet,"This is the 3rd Change Greatest Hits compilation and easily the best one, because it is Italian, the country of origin of this timeless disco-funk ""group"".The included liner notes are very interesting, but only if you understand Italian. The choice of songs makes a lot of sense, even if discriminative, because the Terry Lewis/Jimmy Jam-record (Change of Heart) has not been considered.I basically bought this record for the availability of 3 additional songs from their 1983 record ""This Is Your Time"": Got To Get Up, You'll Never Realize and Magical Night.Sit back, relax and enjoy the best of disco ever."
5,Very funny and emotional,"This story is about a young man named Rin. Rin lives with his friend Kaede. Both of them lost their mothers in an accident, and Kaede takes care of Rin's every need. It looks like they will always be together, until a couple of princesses form other worlds show up and ask him to choose one of them to marry. There is also a classmate named Asa who is gunning for his affections. After things start to settle down a young girl comes from the demon world to live with Kaede and Rin, making everything even more crazy. With all these really great ladies after his attention Rin must choose one, and break the others hearts.This story is very good. It's a great harem style anime with lots of awesome characters and plot twists. It is also very emotional. The last 6 episodes or so are really heavy. The animation quality and voice acting are also very good in this anime. I enjoyed every minute of it. I hope you do too."
4,This Year's Harem Series,"Despite two very weak lead characters, a supporting cast filled with charming characters keeps this series interesting. While harem series are generally predictable in nature, this series has inserted enough humor and twists into the first four episodes to keep me very interested in seeing more. Very recommended."
2,Not Worth It To Me,"I knew I had a head gasket leak or rather cracked head-very slight. Followed instructions to a ""T"" and the fluid never turned from the original blue."
3,Super Reader,"Seeing Max Allan Collins wrote this, it is competently handled, and different to the movie as he saw fit, Tracy expert and writer that he is.I think he might have even modeled a kid on his son. Anyway, this is not too bad at all, so definitely worth a look."
5,Two eras of history meet!,This is a wonderful book that brings the ideals of the Arthurian Legends to the heartstopping action of the Second World War. This book will without a doubt keep you on the edge your seats through a mindboggling story that will leave with many good memories.
3,"Had a lot of good points, but a little old fashioned",This book is too old fashioned for the people of today. It is always saying toisolate yourself and not get involved with people. It is written more formonks and religious. But it did have some good points.
4,Excellent view of a spiritual Christian life,"Whether you're a Christian looking for inspiration in your faith or a non-Christian after an amazing insight into the spiritual side of the church, this book won't disappoint! It is generally a pretty easy read with short chapters on defined topics. As such, the translation seems quite good. Thomas a Kempis soaks the pages with the love and peace that he has acquired from hir religion. The book contains many moral and ethical lessons on peace and humility that as needed in our world as ever. And this is done in a tone that is far from the dry dogmatic style of many other Christian fathers.It's easy to see why, outside the Bible, this has been one of the most popular Christian books!"
3,This movie is totaly safe 4 little kids I'd say 6 and up,The movie was ok.. but the voices were awful compared to their others. My favorite movie of this kind was the Poltergeist Report one! I'd really suggest that movie if you want to see a Yu Yu Haukusho Type Movie. The drawings were not even as close as good as their other movies either. But I really think this is a cute movie for younger viewers around 6 and up.
3,Another Teaser,"Here we go again. This CD has a new cardboard outer sleeve. Open it up and guess what you get THE BEST OF CONNIE FRANCIS budget CD that the US released years ago right down to the artwork. The only difference on this mega hit package is that it contains a fine LP cut THREE COINS IN THE FOUNTAIN from her first bestselling English album NEVER ON SUNDAY. And that's all. The outer cover is a very familiar publicity shot originally used on her second Italian LP release in America and has been used in various guises on many CDs throughout the years. Nice slipcover, some great hits and one gem reissued again."
2,very basic,this is a very basic teaching and you can find all on the internetThis was a waste money.only one star.http://blogdoon.com
5,Fantastic Cookbook!,This is a great book! I lost it in my recent divorce and it was one of the few books I had to go buy again. The salads and pastas stand out. It's well-written and all the recipes are really quite simple.
5,"A Must-Have Cookbook, Whether or Not You're Vegetarian","I almost wish Jack Bishop hadn't put ""vegetarian"" in the title. I hope the connotation of that word doesn't deter meat eaters from checking out this book. These are fantastic recipes - they just happen to be meatless. I don't think there's a recipe in here that has more than 10 ingredients, and most have less than that. I've tried dozens, and haven't come across a bad one yet. The dessert chapter was a little disappointing, probably because I don't have an ice cream machine, but I have discovered the joys of strawberries with balsamic vinegar! This is the book I reach for whenever I want to make something easy and delicious - which is all of the time, of course!"
2,Disappointing,"Based on the description, this looked like a perfect cookbook for me, since I am a vegetarian and I love Italian food. When I actually saw the book and started using it, I was very disappointed. The recipes generally require a lot of time, either in preparing the food or in the time that it takes to cook (e.g., two or more hours in the oven). These recipes would work for someone who is at home all day, but I'm not. Despite being time-consuming, in most cases the lists of ingredients are simple -- but as a result, the food I made from this cookbook was extremely bland. It's possible I just picked bad recipes, but reading over other ones gave me little confidence that other choices would have been better."
2,An Attractive but Disappointing Cookbook,"Although this cookbook contains some easy-to-prepare Italian vegetarian recipes, all the ones I tried were incredibly bland and flavorless.They didn'ttaste bad - they just had no taste whatsoever. I will probably not try any more."
2,Not for vegans!,"I have tried many recipes in this book and I have not found a single one that I will make again. In all cases the taste was extremely bland. This is surprising in view of the overwhelmingly positive reviews on Amazon. I believe one reason is that I only make vegan food, and therefore has to limit my choice to the few recipes without cheese/butter, or skip the cheese/butter. The problem seems to be that the recipes are too simple. Compared with Madison's cookbookVegetarian Cooking for Everyone, which is THE cookbook for vegetarians, the reciepes are definitely simpler (fewer ingredients, fewer steps in the preparation). That makes them easy to make but the resulting taste is just bland. But why waste life making boring food? Good vegetarian cooking is complex.Unfortunately, I have not found any good vegan italian cookbook. In fact the best vegan italian recipes I have found inEssentials of Classic Italian Cooking, although this is not even a vegetarian cookbook."
5,still my favorite!,"Among my dozen or so vegetarian cookbooks, this one is still the best. The red bell peppers stuffed with saffron rice is unbelievably good, as is the lasagne stuffed with bechamel sauce and porcini mushrooms. The best part of this cookbook is that it's adventurous without being outlandish; you aren't asked to find ingredients that you'll never use again. And I've had the most success with the recipes in this book than in any other!"
3,Starter,"quick shipping.. no problems ordering, I havn't installed yet but its tagged as saying ""made in Malaysia"" I'm not real sure how that is ""Domestic"" I might return it since its not ""Made in USA"""
4,Good background on Star Parker,"I liked learning about Mrs. Parker's life before she came to speak at our fundraising event. I liked the book a lot, and her even more. She's very transparent as she tells her story, and I like that in anyone."
2,She's embarassing,Star Parker should be ashamed of herself. She has completely lost touch with her identity. After reading this book I came away with the impression that she hates her own race and buys into the stereotype against her own. She puts herself on a soap box like she's the answer to it all and anyone that does not agree with her is less than deserving. She doesn't realize that she was blessed enough to not get thrown in jail for all of the times she broke the law. She believes the hype about african americans in prision are all guilty. Her race should be ashamed of her!!!!!!!!!!! Mrs. Clarence Thomas. Plus she brags about how she married white like it's some type of gift from god. He may be a nice man but she fails to realize that he was looking for a warm bed and a hot meal. Star the laughs on you.
1,A Christian woman let this be the title of her book,All i can say is that how can a christian woman have this as a title to a book
5,Brilliant!,"Ms. Parker's story is a true eye-opener, exposing the tragic consequences of misplaced American compassion whereby people are given fish rather than taught to fish, creating hopeless dependency rather than joyful self-suffiency. This should be required reading."
4,A fascinating story of rebuilding one's life,"In this book, Star Parker tells how she lived it up while she was on welfare. She had an apartment with a jacuzzi, lived in southern california, went partying every night, got abortions whenever she became pregnant, all at government's expense. Yet she was transformed by a minister. She got off the welfare rolls, raised her children in a wholesome manner, and started her own business. It was a difficult path to take, but she managed to be sucessful. The latter part of the book is full of fascinating political commentary that dispels the myth that if you're a black women you have to be a liberal democrat. A fascinating read"
5,Either you know it or you want to shout it down,"If God directs your life, this book will read like pure refreshment. If you prefer to make God in your image, some wimpy cosmic do-gooder that approves of your every action, you'll hate this book. Not more complicated than that."
2,Major design flaw!,"This case just cost my friend $242.00 to fix her ipod (at the Apple store) because it offered No protection for the corner of the ipod, and that's exactly where it fell."
5,Amazing,"I met Erik Sayenga at a horror movie convention this past august. I noticed his Cannibal Corpse shirt, and we started talking about metal. Next thing I know, he slipped me a copy of Ghoststorm Eulogy, which I got for free because of my Behemoth shirt. On the way home, I put in, and I was floored!This is an amzing EP. I am a fan of black/death metal hybrids, and this is one of the better bands I've heard. The thing that really stands out for me is that the drummer and guitarist are the same person (Erik). This guy is amazing at both instruments. And he doesn't play the same thing over and over, both instruments are varied, giving GE a fresh sound. The keyboards too are nice, they give an excellent atmosphere. My personal favorite is ""Paranormal Apparition.""I strongly recommend this band, as both death and black metal fans can find something in here they can like. Hell, anyone into extreme metal will like this!"
1,"Should be called ""PazzJunk""","As a musician, guitarist, and fan of all types of music, this one left me cold. Nothing to recommend it. If you want to hear some great jazz guitar, check out Kurt Rosenwinkle instead."
1,hardly uses it,My 2 year old was inquisitive about this truck at first. He became frustrated with it when he would try to push it from the back. The dumper would tip back too easily and he would fall down. The tail of the dump has a design flaw in that it extends too far behind the back wheels. It doesn't take much weight to cause it to tip backwards and force the child down on his knees. Nice looking but what you want is a toy that will last through the initial newness phase. disappointing.
1,Truck size is not as described,"This dump truck is described 3 times in the Product Features/Product Details as 14 inches long, but it is actually about 8 inches long. I cannot comment on any other aspects of the truck because it was much smaller than we wanted and we returned it immediately. However, Amazon's return program worked great. We returned the truck to UPS the same day we recieved it and Amazon credited our credit card account the next day. We have been buying from Amazon fairly often for several years, and this is the first time we have had a problem."
1,Return my Money@!,"I can not honestly rate it. I love Tamar, but the disc never worked! I really wanted to experience the talent & writing of this artist.I know Tamar Braxton is very gifted, but send another disc or return my money.Sincerely,Ms. Zenobia JACKSON"
5,En español,"Este libro me viene muy bien para un trabajo que estoy haciendo, hay mucha información bastante dificil de conseguir. Por lo general, en los libros se encuentra un párrafo sobre trailers, salvo algún libro que le dedique un capítulo; pero es muy dificil de conseguir realmente y siempre dicen lo mismo.Este libro es todo lo contrario, está completamente dedicado a ellos, con información muy práctica y completa.Sinceramente me dejó más que satisfecha."
3,Good but,"This is an entertaining look at some of the makers of Lo or No Budget Horror Films. The Title says Horror Business but the Movie is not a look at the business end of movie making or Horror movie making for that matter. What it is is a loose look at the trials and tribs of making movies. It was very good to see Mark Borchardt from ""American Movie"" fame and what he is doing lately but I miss his friend Mike Schank, who I could watch for hours and is not in this movie. But getting back to business, if you are looking for some insight to the business of movie making, it isn't in here. Maybe all you can learn is that it is hard and you have to love it to do it. Great advice indeed but not enough to help you get your movie to market or even how to get the funds and how best to spend the funds. This would be helpful. Still I liked what was there."
1,Don't waste your time/money/interest in this,"Alright, I'm still a film student so I can't rate this on an expert level. On the other hand, I know bad filmmaking when I see it. It's a really armature documentary about armature filmmaking. A lot of flashy effects, a lot of complaining, and a lot of nothing. The guys making it spend the majority of the time complaining about the hardships of filmmaking and how awesome they are... and one guy mentions many times that his mom helps pay his rent (he has a wife and kids!! Time to leave film for a more secure job). Trust me, I get its rough out there, especially for indies, but making a barely watchable doc about it isn't benefitting anyone. All in all, it didn't help me so buy at your own risk. To the filmmakers: Sorry guys, just my opinion :-("
2,Not particularly incisive. .,"There are many books on quantum physics and the men who discovered it. The best I have read were by Brian Greene. While this book was not a difficult read, I didn't find it of any particular interest. This, in spite of the fact that I am deeply inspired by what quantum mechanics may say about our existance."
3,MAD SCIENCE OF KILLING,"This book by Mashiro is an interesting presentation and study of the human anatomy focusing on the body's vital targets and how to exploit them in unarmed combat. Do not let the title of the book dissuade you, this is NOT a ""Death Touch"" Dim Mak manual. I am afraid however that quite a few of these ""target"" areas that are indicated for exploitation would be very hard to target and engage in a fluid and high-stress combative confrontation. This is not to say all the techniques are useless for defensive employment. Overall this text is worth the study for a different perspective on pressure point and joint manipulation attacks. This book is ideal for study by combative instructor and practitioner, if only for its historical value. This is volume one of four volumes, if this book interested you then look into the authors other works in the Black Medicine Series;Black Medicine: Weapons At HandBlack Medicine: Low BlowsBlack Medicine: Equalizers"
5,AS ENCHANTING AS A SUMMER GARDEN,"There are few today who do not know the name Marc Jacobs. His clothing designs have won a loyal following who appreciate his flair and awareness of what becomes women. His designs are understated yet elegant, classic yet innovative.He reflects the same qualities in his fragrances. Of his latest, Blush, Mr. Jacobs said, ""My garden in Paris is permeated with the delicate scent of Jasmine. For me, it is a smell of simple and intense glory - nature in grand performance. I feel a connection exists between this rich flower and the innate power of femininity.""What words could better describe this fragrance? Star Jasmine, which is grown in China and is the richest form of Jasmine, highlights the scent augmented by Japanese Honeysuckle, soft musks and wood notes. It's dreamy, almost tender. Ultra feminine.The bottle is sleek, curved, a blush glass tone topped by a silver cap. Also included in the collection is Body Cream, Body Lotion, and Shower Gel."
5,BOTH INNOCENT AND SEDUCTIVE,"There are few today who do not know the name Marc Jacobs. His clothing designs have won a loyal following who appreciate his flair and awareness of what becomes women. His designs are understated yet elegant, classic yet innovative.He reflects the same qualities in his fragrances. Of his latest, Blush, Mr. Jacobs said, ""My garden in Paris is permeated with the delicate scent of Jasmine. For me, it is a smell of simple and intense glory - nature in grand performance.

Ultra feminine.The bottle is sleek, curved, a blush glass tone topped by a silver cap. Also included in the collection is Body Cream, Body Lotion, and Shower Gel.An unforgettable fragrance."
3,Not very helpful,"Does not deserve a high rating. The content is pale and weak. Most of the suggestion the author gives are really plain rules of thumb. For example, the book suggests the use of Pareto analysis. The topic is done in around 100 words.Not a book for people who search for a serious discussion of planning skill."
4,A Good Read!,"All books that promise to teach you how to manage your time and your tasks more efficiently must be judged by one simple measure: Do they offer techniques that you actually can implement into your life? In the case of Powerful Planning Skills, the answer is an unqualified yes. Although the slim book at first looks simplistic, don't be deceived. Peter Capezio has written a nuts-and-bolts guide that essentially is a straightforward, interactive workbook. The text zeros in on strategic and personal planning styles, while also offering information to help you understand why your past efforts to become the world's best planner might have gone astray. Like most books on time management, this one includes much that you've heard before, but if you're looking to walk away with few new planning tricks, we [...] recommend this book to you."
2,Another crap season.,"How people are rating this beyond three stars is baffling to me. Stick with the first nine seasons, which is the greatest show of all time. They never get old. If you crave more quality hijinks, watch Futurama. If you watch post-90s Simpsons, I envy your courage and/or weird freaky desire to want to torture yourself. I'm sure this looks great on Blu, but so does Twilight.Two stars for what the show used to be."
2,Fox Studio - greedy marketing and little regard for press members.,Fox ThinkJam on-line publicity says they are cutting back product/ What/ the dvds are made in Mexico for like 10 cents a- piece. Getting someone to buy a $40 dvd without a review is simply hateful (and devious). Fans complain the seasons are not getting any better- then ThinkJam should be more responsive to publicity requests to alter negative reactions to their precious BD vault!
3,THEY BETTER MAKE UP FOR 20,season 20 had basicallly zero special features they better have some in this set or i am dead done buying the simpsons on dvd or blu ray for good
5,"Love the content, hate the packaging","It looks like those cheap-o carboard slipcases are here to stay. Highly recommended that you swap out that slipcase with a more traditional disk holder or jewel case for long-term preservation. Toss out the cardboard disk holder (or save it separately), then an inexpensive four-disk case fits in the overwrap nicely. Your DVD's will thank you."
5,Classic for a new generation,"My annual gift to my grown son, he loved it just like he does every year - I hope the series doesn't end too soon!"
1,Accordion disc case kills this box set.,"After suffering through five seasons of these atrocious accordion disc cases I've finally had enough. I've been through 2 sets of this DVD season set and each time all 4 discs were scratched. I'm not talking about 1 or 2 minor scuffs or scratches that can be over looked. It looks as though the discs were thrown across the factory floor read side down and then stuffed into the case. After being in denial for the last few years it's time to accept that 20th Century Fox sucks and doesn't care about its longer suffering customers.Having all 14 prior seasons on DVD, I was looking forward to making this my last season and didn't really want to change formats(the Blu-ray versions are alleged to have plastic disc cases)for one last season."
5,Can't go wrong with the Simpsons,"I can't say that Season 15 is the among the strongest of Simpsons seasons, but it has some very enjoyable and memorable episodes.Some of my favorites:Episode 5: ""The Fat and the Furriest"" - Homer is attacked by a bear and builds an anti-bear suit to protect himself so he can get revenge.Episode 9: ""I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot"" - Homer is determined to prove to Bart that he can really accomplish something. He builds a battle robot which Bart uses to fight other robots. This episode also has a very funny (and a bit sad) side story where the family's cat Snowball II dies and Lisa tries desperately to find a replacement cat.Episode 19: ""Simple Simpson"" - Homer becomes a vigilante in the form of ""Pie Man"". He throws pies into the face of evil doers, but winds up in a tough spot.There are some other good episodes in there, while a few feel a bit tired and uninteresting."
4,Good Book,"I read this book more than a year ago, but I still can say that it was a good read if you like long romance novels."
5,5 Hearts from TRS!,"""There were so many characters, so much action, and so many unexpected happenings that it would be impossible to not find something to like about the book. It was an in-depth study of life in the frontier with feuding land owners, greedy family members and struggles for individuality. Rogers' profound depiction of the people, the historical correctness of the period, and her twists mesmerized me.""""I loved the book and highly recommend it to anyone who loves historical romance. You will be thrilled you read it."" - Brenda Talley"
3,Passionate Tale,This book was written with the passion of true love that is not found in novels written by new authors. I read it initially as a teen and it affected me enough to seek it out as an adult.
5,loved it,I read a lot of books. Rogers is one of my favorite authors. great story couldn't put it down. Love cowboys
3,A strong willed lady,"The book was o.k., a little too slow and you knew how everything was going to work out before the ending even came."
4,Good Book,I enjoyed reading this book and will read more of her books in the future. I do like reading books on my new Kindle.
3,Better then the Steve And Ginny series,"i must say, i liked this book alot better then the Steve and Ginny books. At least here, you actually get a feeling they really care for each other. Their first sexual encounter isn't force or rape(at least, i dont remember it being, been awhile). and the hero isn't a complete and utter jacka**.I could have done without the stepfather part though, that was all sorts of gross. Rowena was a stronger character then Ginny, in my opnion. maybe that's why Ms. Rogeres didnt write more about her.Dont get me wrong, it's got its share of violence towards the heroine. But not as bad."
5,the Wildest Heart,"I found this book at a charity bazaar and started to read it,so spelbound I was and forgetting my surroundings,being caught up in this historical romance that I didn't notice the last page was missing. No I am ordering a new copy to keep for my Library and to read the last page. I will read it again.Just an excellent writer, I recommend this book highly."
5,Truly Captivating,"The Wildest Heart was the first historical romance I ever read...and that was at fourteen. The characterization and story still capture my imagination today (I am in my mid-thirties). I enjoyed being introduced to Rowena and Lucas and viewing the struggles they went through, both together and individually. It was wonderful to have the opportunity to watch them grow emotionally and to watch them discover they were stronger than they realized. Rosemary Rogers' Wildest Heart kept me captivated well beyond the last page...beyond the last word...her Ro and Luke continue to wander out there in the southwest, two truly ""wild hearts."""
2,Was not the edition I needed,"I had searched by ISPN number and this book came up so I ordered it. Upon reciept of the book, I realized it was a very old edition and useless to me."
4,Work just fine.,"I prefer these to the headphones that come with the iPod because they fit further into your ears. As a result, you get better sound and a more stable fit while exercising. They hold up pretty good to exercise. But if you sweat enough, as I do sometimes, they will eventually begin slipping out. For the price, though, I think they're great and I'm perfectly happy with them. They also come with 3 sizes of covers for the headphones - the parts that go into your ears. That's good, because you get the chance to pick your most comfortable fit. Note, however, particularly with the white earphones, you'll have to clean (the earwax off) them regularly."
1,"Totally edited, mangled and otherwise ruined.",[...] reports this film to be 79 minutes long. The version I received from Amazon was 67 minutes. If I'd know that I wouldn't have bothered and you shouldn't either.
2,Drive In Experience,The film skips and jumps big time 35 minutes in. Scratched up and horrible dubbing. This film is in need of an unedited cleaned up version. The film ran 67 minutes not 77 as the cover states. Without all the skipping and jumping edits the film would have run another 10 minutes. Plenty of breast and butt from Barbara Capell. No full frontal nudity. For Barbara Capell fans only!
2,Ball slicer,"This gun is overpriced and slices every paintball put into it. It is not even accurate to start with!!!RIP OFF!!!!Do not get this gun, get the Spyder Sonix or TL-R.(I'm still waiting for it to blow up)"
3,Works for a while...,"I've had this item for several months and it barely holds a charge espcially if it gets cold outside. I've had the original battery for over 5 years and once charged it holds the charge for weeks if I don't use it much.If you need only a standby, it's OK."
1,Shockingly bad writing,"I liked the premise and looked forward to reading the book. Reading it, however, is a chore. The writing is on a level with the majority of internet fiction, which emphasizes volume over quality. There is an overabundance of exclamation points, and a lack of basic description of the scenes which would allow you to picture what the author imagines. The characters have the depth and complexity of wooden stick figures. A recurring thought that I had was that this is the second edition, which I assume would be an edited improvement over the first edition. Perhaps the third, (or fourth or fifth) edition will be a good read."
1,Buyer beware!,"The sign of a good author is when they can make the characters and story come alive in your mind. I read the complete story and was sadly disappointed. The characters were dry without any real personalty. Plus the story had holes big enough to drive a truck thru. Why steal someone elses body in the first place? Their are plenty of gay, rich men who would pay a fortune to have a beautiful young woman's body. After spending most of the book in some mindless chase to get his body back, why would she steal his body back a second time, knowing he's going to come after you again. I'm sorry, the book to me was very poorly writen and very, very boring. I'm not sure why anyone would give this book a 5 star unless they were friends of the author."
1,Poorly fleshed out...,"The characters seem shallow and silly... The concept would be terrifying, and maybe a bit exciting... But, the man now trapped in the female body seems to have zero interest in his new form... You would think that there might be some new limitations... Or he might at least see things in a slightly different perspective being smaller in both height and weight. His character is so driven to get his old body back that the reader wouldn't have known the difference if his body were stolen by another male... Except for the morning sickness which the author seems to find great delight in. The ending was completely silly and unsatisfying as well. We never get to know who these characters are... They both are just driven to do what they do for whatever reason... And the dialog is silly."
2,Waste of money,"This was a big waste of money (I would pay 10 dollars for it max). The CD has a lot of examples, but they all are for some specific situations, if you do not know VBA you have no way of customizing it to your needs (because you have no idea what each code line does). On the other hand, if you do know VBA why would you use this CD, if you can write your own code.I was expecting that there will be actually an explanation for each line of the code, but there is none, it just says, this code does this (for example, Combine column text and replace) and then the pure code comes, that is it for explanation part.If you want to actually learn how to program VBA for excel the best book is ""VBA for Modelers: Developing Decision Support Systems Using Microsoft Excel by S. Christian Albright"" (in my opinion the best book currently in the market which ACTUALLY teaches VBA for excel)."
5,Excellent!,These bags are perfect for mailing the sewing patterns I sell. Very lightweight and durable. Will be ordering more when I run out.
2,Not sure,Joop! has a rather potent smell that seems to come and go during the day. One of my co-workers is actually allergic to it. Probably would try another kind next time but it's certainly been interesting.
2,Whoops!,I thought this book was a journal about Women's travels throughout history. It is actually a blank journal. My mistake.
5,Outstanding!,"Aznavour is daring and tender, exquisitely expressive. I am thrilled to have this CD of his earlier songs! The music of my life (at least at one point)!"
1,"Truly terrible, post-modern, feminist re-interpretation.","Having read over 20 biographies of TR over the years, I would have to say that this is the worst. The author utterly fails to assess TR in his ""context"", though she claims that this is her intent. She judges TR based on modern, ""politically correct"" sensibilities, and, naturally, finds him wanting. This book is more appropriate as required reading in the Women's Studies department at Wellesley College than for a student of history or devotee of TR."
4,yummy,this cd is so great. anyone can relate to at least some of the songs on here. the lyrics are just great. and her voice is amazing.
5,She Outdid Herself!,"I didn't think she could top ""Everything I Need,"" but she did it handily. This music is powerful, heart wrenching, and in your face! Thanks, Melissa, for another FANTASTIC album!"
3,this is a fine wireless router if you ignore the VoIP,"I bought this at Big Lots for $30, because I needed a temporary wireless router quickly. It works fine, lots of good options, no complaints, and the AT&T; thing can be safely & easily ignored.I agree with the reviewer who was annoyed that he paid $129 for it -- no way this little device is worth that much. But for $30, just as a generic cheap wireless router, I'm quite pleased."
1,Horrible!,Didn't receive the book until the end of the quarter when it was time for finals. Seller did not respond to my emails.
4,Not So Much About Saints Behaving Badly as About the Power of Conversion,"An interesting and intriguing look at human beings who have risen above and--in some cases--resisted themselves to become saints of God.At first glance, the title might seem to indicate this book is an attempt to criticize, demean or ""tear down"" saints. Nothng could be further from the truth.This book is not so much about ""saints behaving badly,"" as it is about the power of conversion. Very well done. Not ""preachy,"" but effective. The facts and the lives speak for themselves. A good way to get a cursory initiation into the lives and personalities of the saints.This book gives us all hope that we, too, can live better lives. Saints? Maybe not, but better lives, that we can do...It all depends on the power of conversion and we, to a certain degree, determine that."
4,Entertaining read,"Oh my!! Maybe there is hope for all of us. Some of the lives of these saints before they ""saw the light"" are horrible. Easy read with fun information."
1,A Very Poorly Planned Anime...,"So I had pretty good hopes for this anime given it's licensors and cheap price. In the end it turned out to be a waste of $30. This anime mixes in romance, yuri (lesbian), and mecha all in one, a horrible combination if you ask me. There really wasn't much romance in this anime since the main characters don't exactly feel the same way about each other and every episode is the same. Some drama and ends with a mecha fight. Although I admit this anime's story has potential, it was lost underneath poor planning. If your looking for a yuri or mecha anime try elsewehere. The english voice acting was rather terrible as well which contributed to the overall failure of this anime. Sorry guys but this is one terrible anime."
4,could have had a clearer ending,"I got this book in a box of old books someone gave me. It was a fast paced, great read. My only complaint was the very last line of the book. I didn't reall get it. What happened to the old man, he wasn't completely guilty and where DID he get those cyanide pills from??"
1,boring!!!!,"I started this book and could NOT get passed page 35!! I love nature booksThe Forests of the Night, but this is NOT a Craig Childs, Ann Zwinger etc. or anything in between. I got it on a recommendation from Arizona Highways magazine that Charles Bowden (another good author) wrote about this book. First of all it jumps all over and second you have to speak spanish, because every sentence is part spanish, which gets really old reading the translations, anyway besides that the story is STUPID!!"
3,No noticable relief,I have scatia (probably a sacroiliac joint issue) in my lower back. Using this repeatedly had no real effect other than to make my pelvis around the wedgy feel like it was going to sleep. Instructions state that you may need higher elevation and suggest you put books or something under it for extra height. I think a few more pads should be included to accomplish this.
3,"not useful, for me","REVISION: I had originally gave it one star, because it didn't work for me. But thinking about all the devices I've tried, some work, some don't, every body is different. This might work for you. Plus the ""color"" mixup is the fault of the random seller, not a problem with the product. This is a review of the product not the seller. I'll leave my original review below, but moving it up to 3 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've had a lot of back problems, and have many devices, some good some bad. This one doesn't get used.It's basically a triangular piece of rubber. You can pretty much find multiple things to sit/lie on that have the same effect. Not worth cluttering up the house with this.Furthermore they sent my the female version, pink, although I ordered the male version blue. Not that it matters. If they can't get the logistics right wouldn't it just be easier to make them uni-sex? Or sell by size?Just a marketing product, not a useful medical device."
5,O my aching back,This item has been a great help to my lower back problem. It is very simple to use and to carry around with you.
2,Didn't do much for us,"We bought the male and female versions of the Sacro Wedgy, as we hoped they might address some lower back issues. Unfortunately, the design doesn't work for either of us. The female version feels too wide for me, and while the posterior tilt might be ""normal"", it doesn't feel good for my abnormal lumbar spine. I need something that presses up the sacrum, so the pelvis floats; my fists do a better job, but it's rough on the hands for any length of time! I think I'd just try a tennis ball."
3,durable,"I like this bag and take it everywhere. My complaint is that the panel of leather on the backside of the bag is low quality and has cracked, which makes the bag look cheap. Otherwise I like the placement and size of the pockets and sections."
3,"Good product, but could be better","I love this purse. The leather is soft and the many compartments are great. And I love the cell phone pocket. My only complaint is that the neck strap is extremely stiff and scratches my neck. I have had to make adjustments to my clothes not to be rubbed sore. I am going to make strap covers for the summer and lower necks on my clothes. Still, all in all, I am glad I purchased this item."
2,Nice but small,"Bag was well made, but too small. Can't put much in it. Nice well-made leather bag. If it was three times bigger it would be a perfect."
2,Poor Form,This DVD does not show proper form or rythem to traditional Shotokan karate. I was given this DVD and I'm glad I did not spend money on it. Steve Flores does not show the form or strength that a world class instructor should. Don't waste your money
1,faberware 18 oz thermal mug,"To its brim, this cup holds 16 ounces, not 18. Probably doesn't matter to many. Matters to me. I returned it."
5,Great CD,this cd is one of the best punk cds. its different than AAAs other stuff but its still great
1,not a ska album,When I bought this cd I thought i would get to here the catchy happy horns I got to here on all fall down but there was no horns except for on two songs and on the second song they only played for a couple seconds. I read the other reviews for this album and cant understand how it got good ratings this album .... They are not turning punk they are getting hardcore and there singer's voice is all scary.The lyrics are more politicial but who says thats a good thing All Fall Down was better because they had Politicial lyrics and songs about skateboarding and other things that more people can relate to. I do not recomend this album to anyone you should buy all fall down or destroy what destroys you.
5,Great Jazz/Ragtime Piano Music!,"I'd already become quite fond of these two from their other albums, especially ""Creole Music"" (another collaborative effort of theirs) and ""Ravenna"" (Scott Kirby). On this album, they play with notable skill and energy. It holds up well both as great background music and for listening to with your full attention."
1,dissapointed . . .,The is a very complete book if you want to do anything to a piece of wood but paint it. 5 million ways to stain and repair damage to stained furniture. If you are looking for a reference to get a professional painted finish this is NOT the book for you.
5,Dresdner is a master,"It is a pleasure to read this book. Not only is the author an authority, but his style is very readable. The print is easy on the eyes and the illustrations are complete and helpful. Simple explanations of a complex subject. Very helpful for a beginner, but also a helpful reference when problems develope or specific instructions are needed. Well edited. Highly recommended."
5,Excellent information in an easy to read format,"This book contains all the information needed to make informed decisions about finishing, repairing damaged finishes, and hiding blemishes. Michael Dresdner is a personal friend and lives just a few minutes away from me. I have learned enough from him and his books over the years that many of my friends now come to me for finishing advice! Michael's book presents what many see as a dry subject, in an entertaining, informative, and easy to read manner. My copy is already getting the dog-eared, much used look of a cherished resource book. If you had to pick only one resource, The New Wood Finishing Book is the clear choice. I won't even loan mine to friends!"
5,The New Wood Finishing Book,"A very good ""how to book"" on obtaining the best finish on a wood project for those of us that need all the help we can get. IMO, this book is well written and easy to understand."
3,I needed more detail than this format allows,"I like the format of this series, but it didn't provide enough detail for my needs. My three-star rating is not an indictment of the content, which is excellent. Rather, it's simply a caution to others that if you need lots of detail to get your Word 2007 documents out the door, this series may not be the best for you. However, if you're looking for an in-depth overview, this is a good book. I returned my copy to Amazon shortly after receiving it in February."
5,Great Wall Bracket,"Had to attach a large , wide wooden shelf to a kitchen wall. These brackets were just great. I used four brackets and the shelf is very sturdy with no shimmy at all. Highly recommend this product."
1,This book is unethical,"It has almost nothing to do with business. He wastes the whole book babbling on about the Golden rule. He quotes Dr Seuss and the bible as well as countless other entertainment figures that have nothing to do with business or ethics. All pointless opinions that never get to any point except to follow the golden rule. It seems that he pieced together a bunch of motivational quotes from the web stuck them together and sold it for a profit. Its hypocritical to sell this non-informative book as anything other than motivational, nothing about business. Everyone knows the golden rule, its not worth the money in my opinion. Its not that I dislike it, ive read plentyof books I dislike but are worth the value in their entertainment and opinion. This book gets nowhere about fixing the lack of business ethics."
1,worst book ever,"he kept repeating the word ""golden rule"" my stupid ethics teacher wanted me to read this book and analyze to answer two questions. Seriously this book and all books have one thing in common they just want to make money. This book just states that there is only one rule the golden rule. Are you serious? if there is only one rule in business and life then I think there won't be a life. John Maxwell uses this book as advertising and don't trust everything you here just like enron manipulated its data , this author can say anything just to sell his book. be smart , we all have a brain so use it to think and don't trust everything you hear or in this case read."
2,Wrong color,It's difficult making a color collection because the options does not really show which name is which color. i selected one which I thought was the color i liked but got delivered the wrong one.
5,Magnificent Voice!,"We saw Jamie Davis live in concert during a non-profit arts festival. He's a very charismatic and entertaining man who made the whole audience feel appreciated. Though the kids were tired by the end of the show, we just had to stay until the end. I bought this cd and put it in my husband's lunchbox for an impromptu surprise. He was thrilled!"
5,young ed is back!,"In 1996 Young Ed did a classic album with Bay rap legend Cellski,10 years later he returns to the rap game as Big Bread Ed.This album blew me away!To be honest i wasn't expecting a lot.10 years is a long time not to drop an album and while i appreciated his first album,to me it wasn't an album i'll play a lot(only really 2 songs i liked on it).First the beats are incredible.I dont like most modern rap,but with this Ed has cemented himself as one of the best around.His flow is so strong and he has strong lyrics,and some postive words too.He is as good as anyone in my opinion.Only complaints could be from a selfish point of view is that he didn't have cellski on this with him,but i cant take marks away for that lol.I dont know what he has been doing in the last 10years-i guess hustling getting his money cause he came back with his own company and doing things his way.I can say it was worth the wait!"
5,BIG Breaded a new sound for the Bay,"The first time i listened to ""She Wanna Bounce"" I knew this album was hot. There are some party tunes ,some tunes to just sit back and chill and there is even a few that hit close to home. This is definately the album to have this summer.Check it out .You'll love it and i mean love."
4,A good debut album that makes way for better work,"This debut album by ana voog is often surprising both sonically and lyrically, with the impossible not to memorize word chain lyrics of ""Beautiful Accident"" to the strange halloween witching hour dance of ""Gone"", a song seamingly about an entirely passivist unconsiousness. It's a beautiful peice of music to listen to, and at times you can't help but rewind it and play it again, but often the music is sketchy and incoherent. It is good in part, but pieces of some of the songs do not fit as well as should. For a debut album by a solo artist it's sure to have a following anxiously awaiting the next release."
4,A worthy debut album by a true original!,"While I normally shy away from the ""dance/clubrock"" crap that's out there, Ana Voog is different. Her intriging lyrics are something to behold. She actually has a great voice and I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. The top-of-the-head thoughts on this disc had me thinking of a cross between Yoko Ono and the B-52's. Ana...you can be proud!!"
4,Surreal novel of life in present day Moscow,"The similarities between the futuristic New York City Womackdescribes in in his first novel, AMBIENT (written in 1985) and the presentday Moscow in his new novel, are pretty scary. Only he didn't have to makeany of it up for LET'S PUT THE FUTURE BEHIND US; post-Soviet Russiais a near-anarchic mess practially ruled by gangsters and former Communist bureaucrats-turned'entrepreneurs.'It's a funny, heart-rending, wild ride, featuring Womack's trademarklinguistic and imaginative inventiveness."
1,"So far, not so good","I bought this because I read the good reviews, and figured, for the price it was a great deal, even if it's reconditioned. Five minutes ago I went to use it for the first time and all of the water I filled it with started pouring out the bottom. Unfortunately, I have already disposed of the packaging materials, so I can't return it to Amazon. Cuisinart requres me to pay the shipping to send it to them, plus include money for the shipping back, so it will be cheaper for me to try to order another rather than fulfill the product's 90-day warranty(which is not the three year warranty which Amazon is advertising--that seems to have been whited out in my instruction booklet). And also, it does NOT include two paper filters. Hopefully, I can get this worke out, but so far, I'm not impressed"
1,GARBAGE!,"I picked this coffeemaker up on the ""Remanufactured"" deal on Amazon. What I did not know was that ""Remanufacturered"" meant ""obvious warranty returns jammed into a new box and resold"".The mugs were FILTHY. With DRIED COFFEE ON THEM. At least I HOPE it was coffee.The mugs were both dented as if a car had run over them, yet the shipping box and product box had NO DAMAGE WHATSOEVER. Obviously they had been damaged before the ""remanufacturing"" process.I'm dissapointed in Amazon for selling this trash."
3,Convenient but cups are not so good,"My husband received this item for Christmas of 2002. I love the fact that he can make just 2 cups of coffee to take with him as he walks out of the door and not leave me with half of a carafe of coffee. The only thing that I don't like is that the cups are cheap and have come apart. I don't wash them in the dishwasher but nevertheless, the plastic liners have come away from the steel holders...which means every time I wash the cups I have to dry both the liner and the steel outer shell and then push the plastic liner back into the steel sleeve."
1,"returned it due to ""electrical issues""","I am still waiting for my refund or replacement, as I returned this item immediately as the problem with the electrical (on/off button) were a serious safety issue. I returned this and have heard nothing from Amazon or the manufacturer.The power switch would give you a slight shock when touching to turn the item on or off, at first I thought it was just me, but after checking it several times my husband and I decided ""two-to-go"" although very convenient in thought was not worth risking electrical shock, or possible fire due to shortage.It has been nearly a year since the item was returned and I have had no luck from anyone in regards to a refund or replacement."
2,Bought the 2 to Go at Costco,".... The coffee does not come out steaming hot like I like it! The coffee is not equally distributed in each cup due to a slight tilt in the filter basket. The filter basket constantly gets clogged even when using the required Melita cone filter.(I tried the natural and the white filters.) When it gets clogged, you have a mess on your countertop if you are not there watching it. All around, this product is mediocre.. and probably the stainless steel travel cups are worth the price of the item.I am back to my commercial Bunn always ready coffee maker with fresh ground beans with my 2 glass pots(one decaf and one regular) and loving it! It takes about 2 minutes to brew each pot with no wait time. My wife and I drink a lot of coffee."
3,Not hot enough,"This coffee maker lasted about 8 months for me, and then I started getting luke warm coffee. While it worked, it was great, very convenient and made good coffee, but luke warm coffee is awful, so I have to give this three stars."
4,Nice little machine,"I received this machine (non-refurb) as a gift for my birthday. I finally starting using it about a month ago and I am rather happy with the machine. It quickly makes good coffee and is easy to take care of.Like other reviewers have noted, if you pop open the top lid of the machine after it's done brewing, but still hot, you'll occasionally get a blast of steam out of it. Although the noise suprised me, it hasn't burned me yet....I usually only make one cup of coffee at a time, but when I did make two at a time, I didn't notice any odd distribution between the two cups.Speaking of the cups/mugs, they are of good quality and seem to clean out easily. My cuisinart mug is sitting on my desk next to me as a I type this."
2,Don't recommend this product,"I purchased this product new, not refurbed. When it did work, it made good coffee and was very convenient. However, after only about 4 months, it died. Worked fine until the morning it leaked hot water all over the counter along with coffee grounds. Bizarre! I cleaned it up and it's never worked again. The coffee mugs are also really wide in the base. It may not fit in your car. Overall, I'm sure there are better to-go coffeemakers out there."
1,BUMPS,"I thought this had to be an amazing product at over a hundred dollars a bottle and could not resist purchasing at an 80% discount. It was not the bargain I imagined it to be, I am not allergic to anything yet I developed a bumpy rash an hour after using it. Thank goodness I only used it on my legs. Afterwards my skin was drier than before."
4,Super,"Very nicely done book with outstanding photos or arms, uniforms, equipmnt and the text is well-done. Great for older kids and adults too."
4,"For the Hard Core S&M, B&D lover","I just finished reading this book, and althought its not the best erotica that I've read, it certainly was worth the money I spent on it. Its alot harsher, not as ""fairy tale"" like as other S&M novels I've read. So for those of weak heart, you've been warned. I agree with other reviews that the book has a unique ending. Its abrupt, and in the true dominant style, it leaves you wanting more. The focus was on the training of the slave, and not the outcome of that training. (possible idea for new novel?) This book leaves you aching if you are one who is openminded, shocked if you are of the faint at heart."
3,A Hard-core fan,"Hard-core, punishment, domination, mostly whipping & spanking, a minimal variety of sex. Not very imaginative. Not enough psychological drama or information about feelings. Mostly about what was physically happening and said. OK story line, the writing was average. There was no ending."
2,Where did the author go?,"The author spent alot of time building a beginning to a very good story line and then abandoned it before the first fifty pages were completed. The only character that I could even remotely relate to was dropped off in the first or second chapter. I kept reading in hopes that the author would follow thru, but was disappointed. This book is published proof that the publisher didn't read beyond the first fifty pages. If I were Blue Moon publishing I wouldn't have let this one get beyond my slush pile. Don't waste your money if you're after erotica with any kind of story line."
4,Very nice and useful product for the price,I just edited 30 X20mn TV shows with the help of this device. I was quickly able to programm it as I wanted with Adobe Premiere Pro CS5.5The only problem I have with it is that each time I shut down the computer I have to reinstall the software because the device becomes non responsibe. I don't really know why. It may be my fault with the administrator authorisations etc.But installation is a very quick process as long as you keep the install CD nearby so it's ok both for the value and for the use of use. Great construction quality.
4,Good - but problem with IMovie 8,"Great Jog/Shuttle. Firm under the hand. Very responsive controls. One current (and hopefully they resolve this soon) limitation is that the Shuttle Pro does not automatically recognize IMovie 8.Manual says: ""The software automatically detects the program you are using and automatically switches to the correct application settings associated with the application.""Well not on my system (brand new iMac) which came with iMovie 8 installed. There is an iMovie setting in the Shuttle Pro Application settings - but it must be for an earlier version of iMovie as it's not recognized. I had to add the settings myself. That's not a big deal - but I'd expect that something as popular as iMovie 8 would be supported out of the box. I did go to the Contour web site to look for config files/drivers that would support iMovie 8 -- I'm still waiting for my registration e-mail to give me download access..."
1,WILL NOT WORK IN WINDOWS 7,"No matter what the company says, the device will not work in Windows 7. Yes they have drivers and no they do not work. After an hour tech support will finally admit that the drivers are frantically being re-worked because the current ones fail. Why didn't they admit that before I spent the hundred bucks? I guess they wanted the hundred bucks more.Read what others are saying: IT DOES NOT WORK."
5,Awesome Shuttle Pro,"If you are a Photoshop ""power user"" and thinking about buying the Shuttle Pro, don't even think twice about it. This is an awesome addition to a graphics tablet. The two center wheels are worth the price of admission alone. Don't use their PS defaults, though. I set the inner wheel to adjust my brush size. Being able to do this on the fly is wonderful. Set the outer incremental ring to zoom in and out. Remember, in PS you should be viewing at 100% or even increments thereof. The built-in stops on the ring really facilitate this. I set the four bottom keys up as my modifier keys with the fourth one being space bar with hold down activated so I can move around in my zoomed photo. If you're a PS professional you'll find that this device really speeds up a digital workflow and will easily pay for itself in a short amount of time."
3,Price?!,When I placed the order it was for $19.99. After a few days later it was down to $12.99 not Fair!
5,Legal Studies Student,I purchased this book for a research paper. It was an easy read and gives us specific accounts about the conditions and the operations within the correctional system. It is enlightening for those wanting to learn about the care of inmates and if the acts of cruelty to mentally ill inmates are justified and in alinement with the justice system.
3,"Thorough, important and grim","This is an impressive piece of research and journalism. Because of the subject and the many anecdotes, quotes and examples it is not an enjoyable read, but what it reveals feels important for us all to know about."
1,Glenn A Baker? Glenn A Faker is more like it! (Rock Me),"If you are looking for ACCURATE information about the Monkees, this is NOT the book to buy! This book is poorly written, and even more poorly researched. The incorrect information in the book is so blatant that even a casual Monkees fan can pick out the misinformation or spend 30 seconds on the internet confirming the mistakes. Steer clear of this book!"
2,Entertaining but not completely accurate,"Kudos to Baker for writing a book about The Monkees, the most misunderstood group of rock history. They still tour and are still popular (and still damned good). But, aside from some decent photos and a fairly interesting pace, there's a ton of misrepresentations here, old rumours that noone bothered to check up on and just plain old errors. In dates, personal lives, etc.--just about every element is distorted at least somewhat. I'm not saying intentionally, but still... Which while it doesn't really stop you from reading, it gets pretty annoying. Come to think of it, of all the books published about The Monkees, there is no one single definitive tome available and there never has been. Maybe one day a serious literary endeavour will emerge to tell the whole story accurately, but then The Monkees story is not yet over."
2,"I give it an ""eh""","First of all, the book had some really great pictures. That's the good thing about this book. The ONLY good thing. The bad thing is that most of the information is wrong, wrong, wrong! There are many errors in this book, and it'll get Monkees fans really really confused (it happened to me!) Now, I just like to look at the pictures in the book. Steer clear, don't read!"
5,Full of interviews and pictures,"I highly recommend this book. It is literally packed with quotes from interviews, and great photos. Interviews are of everyone involved with the Monkees from the beginning, and the Monkees then and now. Discusses the background of how the show began, and what went on behind the scenes. Also has a discography and TV episode guide, as well as biographies of each of the Monkees. This is a great book, everything you want to know is here."
4,THIS IS A GOOD BOOK,"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT, WITH A DIFFERENT COVER TO IT, ITS VERY GOOD, I DIDN'T GET THE NEW ONE, SINCE I'VE YET TO COMPARE IT TO THE OLD ONE THAT I PUT AWAY, BUT ITS THE SAME AUTHOR, SO I'M PRETTY SURE THIS BOOK IS AS GREAT AS THE OLD ONE, PICS AND ALL.IS THIS THE SAME BOOK?"
2,Legendary Cars,"At first glance, it is an impressive book with outstanding photographs of the cars reviewed. Each car gets two to four pages of text (albiet, most of the page space is photography) and does a reasonable job of giving an overview of the vehicle.Now for the negatives. I honestly don't think this book was edited. It has so many typos it is difficult to read. I have seen first drafts of 8th grade research papers that had less grammatical and spelling errors. This is the worst I have ever seen in a formally published work.Secondly, when I got the book, the binding was crisp and tight. By the time I finished reading it, the pages were falling out of the spine. It is the most poorly assembled book I have owned. It's going in my library, but I'm afraid to open it again.I cannot recommend this book unless you just want it for the pictures, and to use the pictures to hang on the wall since they seem to fall out on their own anyway."
4,I thought it was all over with...,"This CD is the first very good disc from P since Da Last Don. Everything since then has either been barely average or just crap. I was a big NL fan during the good old days (96-99) but then everything went to hell. It's great to see that P can still make a great CD. He's gone back to his style from Ice Cream Man and Ghetto D, which is refreshing since those were his best 2 discs ever. This is a clear 3rd place of all his albums. This album has good songs, good beats, and good guests. It's a must buy for any past or present NL fan or P fan."
3,Master P needs hit,"Master is back , Master p with his new album,I hope it better then the bad side of his last album. Master P is ok in still album but I waitt for him to get out jail.a three out of 5. Hits like I'm a Gangsta,Respect My Game and Thug Chick ."
3,No Limit is still aroung,"This guy needs to give it up. Time to retire. Standout Tracks-I need dubs,hood star,get the party crackin(tight beat)"
5,THE DON OF THE SOUTH WHAT CAN I SAY,It is amazing how this man has came time after time and brings something new to each album he releases.. 10 years in the game and still have it....Show some support and listen dont think this is you average album let track 2 4 5 6 7 just to list a few RIDE this album bangs from start to finish with about 2 tracks that i dont like....other wise its 98 percent DOPE UGHHHHHHHHHHH
4,He's Back.,"After a huge disappointment in Good side, Bad Side, P comes back wit his old stuff. This goes back to ghetto D. He comes a lot harder this time, and there's less of that crap from last album.Stand-out tracks are: Shut it down, Respect my game, there they go, I ain't playn.If you liked old Master P, this album is for you. If you liked good side, bad side.... i feel sorry for you."
1,Avoid this Mechant,Seller substituted a cheaper brand of seamless paper and a different shade of grey. I did not authorize the substitution. I will not use this merchant again and recommend that other people avoid them.
2,I expected a little more,"I purchased this video as a reference for fine-tuning my kata. The production of this video was great. They showed all 4 angles of the form, along with practical applications of the techniques. What I did not appreciate was the poor form of Mr. Flores. His motion was robotic. There was no fluidity at all. Everything was telegraphed, his stances were shoddy, his head was bobbing throughout his steps, he did not marry his hand attacks with gravity, and so on. If I was a judge at a competition, I would give him a 3 out of 10 if he was a blue belt. For a so-called ""master"" to give a performance like this is shameful."
3,Another great Mandie book!!!,"Mandie and the Courtroom Battle is another great Mandie book!! Mandie, in an earlier book, (Mandie and her Missing Kin) finds a will that entitiles her to her father's house. But things go wrong when her stepmother claims that she has the real will. But to make matters worse, the will is stolen! How is Mandie ever going to prove that the house is really hers??I really enjoyed this book. At first, I was a little disappointed, because by the title it sounded like it was going to take place in a courtroom, but Mandie was barely ever there. But, Lois pulled it out at the end. (at least enough to make me love it!!!) I loved the feelings that took place between Mandie and Joe. And the feelings that Mandie feels toward her father's house. Lois Gladys Leppard did a wonderful job on this book!!!"
4,"A great book, and Mandie finally facing her old stepmother for the first time!","This book was great, and the mystery was intereseting. The only bad thing about it was that Mandie didn't show any emotion at all about seeing the woman who she had thought was her mother for her entire life.And also, I wish that the Shaws had convicted them.But it was a good book anyway."
5,Let the Bacchanal Begin,"Ray Johnson's handy guide to ""Enjoying Wine"" is the perfect resource tool for anyone who has ever felt overwhelmed by having to choose a wine. In simple, useful and humorous chapters, Johnson takes his years of experience and breaks down the do's and more do's of wine appreciation. He discusses everything from retail sales, marketing a brand, restaurant lists to how to pair wine and food. This book also has worksheets that allow you to apply the knowledge you've gained along the way. A delightful read from a man who obviously knows and loves his wine."
4,great beginners guide,"Ray Johnson has written an excellent guide for any beginner looking to learn more about wine, especially with respects to entertaining. The chapters are very well organized and easy to read. Johnson does a great job in highlighting the most enjoyable aspects of drinking wine, and he makes learning about it very easy. A great guide!"
5,Look great on 2007 Toyota Tacoma Access cab - BUT!,"Look great but not so easy to install. Instructions could be better, maybe some pictures.I found it impossible to put on by instructions. Put brackets on then bolted bars onbut then could not torque bolts. There just is not enough room to get a torque wrench on.Had to take them all the way off and attach bars to brackets - torque bars to bracketthen bolt the whole assembly to the car. Needed someone to hold up the assembly as I bolted itto the car. Happy with the look and quality but get someone to write better instructions"
3,Solid entry in detective series,"Kathy and Brock have worked together before, but I haven't read those books and you don't really need to, to enjoy this one. Silvermeadow is set in a fantasy giant super mall, complete with volcano that goes off every hour, to everyone's enjoyment. It also has had a girl go missing, and end up in the recycling compactor, crushed. Was she the first girl? Have there been others? What is going on at Silvermeadow?An enjoyable, easy to read dective procedural with nothing earth shattering in writing or concept, and with the fatal flaw of having the villian explain way too much at the end (any normal villian would have just killed the copper, not spoken about every crime he had commiteed for 20 minutes until help could arrive!) I would describe it as a cozy read, the sort of thing you're happy to have on holiday because it's highly readable but not so engrossing that you don't want to go out and see the sights..."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"This thriller by Brian Haig is a cut better than most books of the genre being put out there today. It has a taut, realistic plot that Haig mostly keeps under control, unlike other authors who get their heroes into impossible situations and then have to employ wacky devices to get them out of it. Haig does not require you to suspend disbelief -- at least not much -- and manages to weave a plot that keeps you coming back for more. Main character Sean Drummond, however, is a mixed bag. He's a good character but, ye gods, he's definitely got to be one of the the most sarcastic and arrogant protagonists in modern fiction. It gets old after awhile, causing the reader to come perilously close to rooting for the bad guys. But all in all, ""Private Sector"" is a mostly enjoyable read and Haig is a mostly enjoyable author."
5,Major Drummond in a Thriller,"I'll begin by saying that this is a genuine thriller, and if you like thrillers, Private Sector is worth reading. It is the third of Brian Haig's novels that I have read, and it is the best. In the previous books, I was turned off by his wisecracking protagonist, Major Sean Drummond, a US Army lawyer. But in this one, Drummond is loaned to a snooty, Washington law firm, and his flippancy toward its arrogant attorneys is refreshing. He replaces Captain Lisa Morrow, an Army attorney and good friend. But Captain Morrow is brutally murdered, and Drummond soon suspects that she had learned something about the law firm that put her in mortal peril. Murders continue, and when Drummond finds how they are linked, he becomes the killer's target. The plot twists and turns until it reached a thrilling climax."
5,Sean Drummond is the insomniacs best friend,"If a good nights sleep is what you yearn for, do not under any circumstances begin reading this book in bed. You will find yourself drawn into Sean Drummonds fast-paced world, where witty sarcasm reigns supreme. His temporary foray into the ""Private Sector"" of a Washington law firm proves to be a fascinating thriller that is enormously satisfying. My only recommendation would be that you first read Secret Sanction in order to understand the connection/relationship between Sean and Lisa Morrow (the first murder victim in Private Sector).Like a great chef, Brian Haig once again manages to cook up a story that pleases the literary palate with just the right mix of humor and suspense. You will find yourself reading into the wee small hours, but not regretting your loss of sleep."
3,three and a half,"I have enjoyed Brian Haig's other novels and looked forward to this one. Towards the end the main character (who I do like) was getting a bit annoying. He can't ALWAYS be right, Always guess everything, Always be the the wise-guy. And the plot reached a bit too far. It was almost a four star, if the editor had pulled it back a bit it would have been up to his previous books. I look forward to his next book!"
3,interesting book but missing 31 pages from publisher,I was happily ensconced in reading Private Sector when the pages skipped from 90 to 121. These were not removed but never inserted into the book. The book looks mint. Amazon is replacing it in a prompt and courteous manner. I am hoping that the next copy comes with all the pages.I went to check on the publisher but this was published by AOL Time Warner and their website is closed. Interesting.Anyway Sean Drummond seems to be a delightful lawyer version of Jack Reacher without him being part of the violence. I look forward to checking out the other stories by the the author.
3,"good read, awful proofreading (Kindle)",I would have given this a fourth star if the proofreading (and even editing) were not so bad. Not sure what else to say.
5,Awesome uplifting melodies,"This track is pure epic trance, with an absolutely beautiful, uplifting lead melody and top quality production. Where most trance follows similarly predictable, serious melodies that don't really bring any new feelings, 'Everyday' is a complete headrush, I can just imagine it going off at a summer beach party in say, Miami, and the crowd going bonkers! One to stick on when your'e feeling a bit down, cos it'll definately lift you up."
4,Delicate chamber-pop,"I disagree completely with the Amazon reviewer regarding the cohesiveness of this album. Each track is minimal and subtly arranged, with strong vocal performances from the guest artists. As we've come to expect from Merritt, the recurring theme is love gone sour and moments of fleeting happiness in a blighted life. While Wasps' Nests was a compendium of carnivalesque synth pop featuring a roster of indie luminaries, Hyacinths and Thistles is a more cabaret-like affair, with more stylized vocals and less emphasis on sing-along choruses. In that sense, I would say Wasps' Nests is more of a tribute album than this one, which reflects the diversity of 69 Love Songs in a fraction of the time while retaining the discipline and structure of a proper song cycle. My one complaint is the 24 minutes of languid descending synths that closes the album...10 minutes would have been more than enough."
5,Excellent effort,"Don't listen to the other reviews. I am always astonished how people have to bash a record the second it comes out, because it doesn't fit what THEY think the artist should have done. ""Just Like A Movie Star"" is a beautful song. A classic which shows Merritt in top form. ""Lindy Lou"" is another truly amazing song. And ""A Sailor in Love With The Sea"" is a great example of lyric perfection. Gary Numan' vocal is twisted and sparse. I am not going to pretend i love every song on the album. But if that were my criteria, I would have to scrap every Merritt album (save House of Tomorrow) and every other album by every other artist in my collection. This album is much more accessible than 69 Love songs. What surprises me most about the other blistering reviews posted here, is that all their criticisms seem much more appropriate for 69 Love Songs than this album. If anything, 69 is more shamelessly indulgent and heavy with fluff and filler."
2,Nowhere near the quality of other Merritt releases,"I'm sorry, but this album is simply not good. Anyone who thinks it is is just blinded by the trendiness of Stephen Merritt and his clicky crew. I can't think of one song that is even remotely close to the greatness of most of the songs on the last 6ths album. These are uninspired songs written by a bored musician. Remember those catchy pop songs on Wasps' Nest? or Holiday? well, kiss those goodbye cuz there are none here. What you get now are 14 heartless, boring, and thoughtless tracks. I recommend you skip this one."
2,"pretty nice, then broke","This was a great value and performed well, although you must be real diligent about closing the filter-basket until it clicks, otherwise it will pour hot coffee all over the place. But after about 100 days it's just started blowing steam and can't finish a pot of coffee anymore. Tomorrow I'll dissect it in the name of...tinkering...and buy a larger french press."
2,Utterly Messy,"I bought this coffemaker from amazon a while back, and some reviewers then warned that it had a tendency to dump hot coffee all over the counter. Sure enough, the little rubber plug that keeps coffee from flowing when the pot's removed midbrew has a tendency to misdirect the flow of coffee, at which point coffee ends up on the counter instead of in the pot. Irritating design flaw, to say the least...and I assume it hasn't been corrected. I've had the coffeemaker over a year now, and though I've learned to pull the little plug all the way down, every once in a while I go into the kitchen and find hot coffee everywhere. Pulling the plug out would solve things, but then I'd lose the ""interupt"" function, which I like. Also, the whole coffeebar gimmick is meaningless. Having said all that, I generally like the job it does...when it doesn't misbehave. But don't leave valuable antique books on your counter, ok?"
4,good little coffee maker,"I have used this coffee pot for the past 15 years, I am on my fourth one and looks like they are not being manufactured any more - bummer. It is a good little coffee maker by cuisinart. Not cheap but none of the cuisinart line is."
1,It's a $35 piece of cardboard!!,"We had great hopes for this gift - our twins went out on Halloween as mailmen - so imagine our distress when this arrived. Two folded pieces of cardboard. Then, we tried for an hour to figure out how to fold the pieces in such a way as to make them intertwine as shown in the picture. No instructions. (Go ahead and laugh, but I'm reasonably handy, and this cardboard origami was IMPOSSIBLE.) Even if we had figured it out (we are sending it back) our twins (2 1/2 years) would have torn this up in a day. Add instructions and it would be worth a third of the price."
3,three and a half stars.....,"This is the independently released debut from underground producer/sometimes emcee Sixtoo. This album from the Nova Scotia based rapper has him emceeing, producing, scratching, and playing piano. It's very lofi and some of the songs suffer badly from poor recording, also the lyrics dont always flow that well, but nonetheless, for a debut effort he shows alot of promise, which he eventually made good on with his later instrumental albums and his production work for anticon artists and cohorts such as sole, sage francis and buck 65. if you are a fan of anticon or buck 65 then check this out, i suggest listening to it late at night in the dark with headphones on, the less stuff to distract you, the more you can hear what he was trying to achieve."
4,Ruby turns to blues,"The so far last album by Ruby is very back to the roots. It's handmade andbluesy. She explains that she does not want the ""make over"" of the bigcompanies and that is why this album is released with the independentlabelIndigo. The title track is very catchy. Apart from that, the album is agoodlisten. If you like handmade, blusy stuff, go for it, but if you like R&Band Ruby's previous style, this album might disappoint you....though, it'salways good to see an artist going his/her own ways."
2,Could have been great,"I have to agree with the rater about snippets. The show spends way too much time on hype. It's like a never ending commercial for the show. Too bad, it could have been interesting.... I don't understand why most seem to believe you have to scream at people to gain interest. It definitely has the opposite effect on me. If you want to watch this show, just mute the sound....."
5,Great Show,There's only 2 episodes on each disc and there's no play all feature so you have to press play for each episode but this show is good so I don't really mind
2,Overdone,"I'm just not used to these types of shows I guess. So much hype, so many interruptions and repetitions of hackneyed phrases between the snippets of real personality.Please don't use this to compare to other (mostly bad) cable shows. This rating is just ""absolute""."
1,Hillstrands being sued,"CEO David Zaslav reaps a $33.9 million in a single day, his company however attempts to bankrupt hardworking fishermen.I regret having ever bought any of the Deadliest Catch, I guess the working class aren't allowed to have anything nice anymore. I hope Zaslav chokes on seafood, and I'll never buy or watch anything from the Discovery channel for the rest of my life."
3,Repetitive,I didn't see a lot of heavy weather but I expect they couldn't film in that. I was expecting more I guess hollywood style but reality was bad enough. The content was a bit repetitive though. It coulld have been edited to one DVD of about an hour's length.
5,Deadliest Catch - Season 1,"This is a great series. It's unbelievable what these men will go through for the catch - 40 ft waves crashing over the side of the boat while trying to pull up 800 lb crab pots in the dead of winter on the Bering Sea. The next time I order king crab legs, I won't complain about the price. Very interesting story lines as you follow each boat and their crew - interesting characters. Can't wait for further seasons to follow Sig & Edgar on the Northwestern, Rick and Donna on the Maverick and the others."
5,A 10 year old Favorite,My 10 year old son asked for the Deadliest Catch season 1 set and he loves it! He has already watched many episodes at least a million times. I enjoy the fact that there are no commercials during the episodes.
5,Deadliest Catch is Awesome!,We love watching Deadliest Catch and were excited to buy the first disc set. We will purchase Season 2 in the near future. For now we look forward to watching the new episode every week!
5,Pure cream from a Master,"George MacDonald Fraser was a fantastic writer. All of his books are excellentreads, whether you read his fiction or non fiction. The McAuslan stories aresomewhere between. They are really autobiographical tales of his service in aScottish Highland infantry regiment immediately after WWII. If you're not a bigreader of military history books you'll still enjoy these immensely entertainingvignettes. Fraser could turn a phrase and his character sketches are brilliant.I was truly sad to finish this book, I wish there were more. Fortunately thereare still Fraser books out there I haven't read yet, I'm still looking forwardto ""Pyrates"", ""The Steel Bonnets"" and the few ""Flashman"" books I haven'tgotten to."
4,A pretty solid effort,"This CD is a pretty good effort by Steve Rowe and Mortification considering he had cancer, but if it had not been that this CD would have just been ok. The CD is pretty much all types of metal showing up and blending together and ends up being mostly thrash and groove metal blended together with the other genres showing slightly. The only ""totally awesome"" songs on here are Unified Truth and Influence, but the rest are average and very passable. The CD is also good because of its uplifiting message. So if you're looking for a pretty good metal CD, consider this one. Oh yeah, if you look in the little booklet in the CD and get the original CD, don't even count on buying any of the merchandise in there. Just a final thought..."
5,Their cd Primitive rythem machine is the best I heard,I wanted to hear more of them so they need to put out another album. On the other hand my mom thinks that the music is not good and that it is not Christian
3,I like mortification alot but ...,I don't know guys this cd just didn't sit right with me listening to the track Triumph of mercy ... I'm notsure I like where mortification is going with their music that's all ...
5,Easiest welding rod to use.,My neighbor's 14 year old niece made excellent welds on a John Deere tractor.Arc starts easily without the rod sticking.
1,Skip this book,"A lot of psycho-babble in a rather boring book. Dr. Budd summarizes work from others that he is impressed with. If you must read it, find a copy in your local library....it's not worth the money."
5,Worth Owning,Made in America is a great DVD series to watch by yourself or with a friend or spouse. Each episode informs you how three different companies began and continue to thrive in the U.S. The shows are only half-an-hour so they are perfect for watching while you're having a meal or just need a short break!
5,lots of good entertainment in this DVD; well done,This DVD is very entertaining and something for the entire family to watch. Great job done by the producers & everyone else involved. !
2,A dull album from an artist capable of better things,"This album was a major disappointment for me after hearing the superior ""Dead Reckoning,"" Kane's previous album. Other than the witty ""You're Just Taking Up Space,"" there are no songs here up to the level of the previous album. Perhaps the worst track is the utterly pointless cover of ""Its a Wonderful World,"" a strong indication that Kane ran out of musical ideas at some point. Skip this album and go with ""Dead Reckoning"" instead."
3,just a statue,The John Lennon action figure is more of a statue since it only says two thing and doesn't move.
3,My boyfriend bought THIS John for me..,"When I received it I was surprised to see how tall he stood. The likeness is uncanny! I love John he's one of MY favorite Beatles.The fact that THIS John speaks 2 phrases was way cool for me...... a John fan. BUT.... as I was surfing the net a few days after my boyfriend bought me THIS John, I found a totally more interesting John.Same everything like the first BUT the one that I found claimed to speak 7 phrases!I bought THAT John. :-) I didn't have the heart to tell my boyfriend that the one I bought spoke 5 more phrases than the one he bought me. I just told him, "" Now we have one to keep in the box & one to play with. "" The second one was about the same price as the first John. Long story short..... pays to shop around."
5,Forever Michael(Q.T.)Cuccione,"I'm a huge 2GE+HER fan,but never got a chance to but the Album until after the untimely death of Michael(Q.T.)Cuccione,it pains me to see someone so multi talented pass-away at the age of 16,but through this CD and the first one the fans will never forget him.My favorite songs are ""5GE+HER"", ""I gave you my 24/7"" and ""Awesum Luvr"" I love these songs because they showcase Michael's singing ability, that will always be missed by me and all his fan all over the world. I know he's watching me as I write this.Michael I miss you, but I won't forget you."
5,cool cd!,Alot better than the first cd! Asome songs! Has quite a few cuss words in it though! Good lyirics and the song s are from the tv show on mtv!
5,2ge+her is the best boy band out there!!,"Okay, I read some of the other reviews for this album, and whoever tells you this album isn't funny or worth buying, they are out of their mind!!!!This album is the funniest thing I have ever heard in my life. 2ge+her is by far the best boy band out there, b-cuz they make everything funny. They are great guys too! Everyone should buy this album. Even if you aren't into pop. I listen to alternative, rock, rap, hip hop, pop, and everything else, and this album is my favorite CD in the entire world!"
5,THEY DID IT AGIAN!!,"2GETHER'S 2ND ALBUM ""2GETHER AGIAN"" IS SO COOL.I LOVE ""EVERY MINTUE,EVERY HOUR"".I LIKE ""I WANNA KNOW YOUR NAME"".AND THE 1ST SINGLE ""THE HARDEST PART OF BREAKING UP IS GETTING BACK YOUR STUFF"".I LOVE THE VIDEO FOR IT.AND IF YOU BUY IT AT TARGET IT HAS ""THAT'S WHEN I'LL BE GONE""(TACO VERISON).2GETHER IS THE BEST AND YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THIS ALBUM."
4,Fun for fans,This is one of the better figures of the LOTR dolls. It actually looks like Treebeard. The voice is a bit hard to understand on some of the phrases. If you are a fan of Green Man imagery he's a great one to have. As a collector I know you aren't supposed to take them out of the box but this one is coming out of his.
2,Disapointing,"If you are interested in fun, playful cards, then this is not the book for you. Most of the cards in this book are what I would call, ""boring."" There are a lot better books out there. Save your money."
4,The Big Book of Greetting Cards,This book is really good for making cards with very detailed but easy to follow instructions. I am very happy with this purchase
5,The Big Book of Greeting Cards,The instructions are very detailed and good. The cards I have made turned out very nicely.
5,Lots of good ideas,I thought this was a good book for ideas. It has a ton of examples and even some different ways to use the same template. I'd recommend it for when you need a new idea.
4,Greeting Cards,The book The Big Book of Greeting Cards (Big Books) was purchased as a gift for my daughter. She has enjoyed reading it and has made several projects using the instructions from the book. She would recommend it to anyone interested in making their own greeting cards.
1,No help at all,"What is the point of this book? Each of the drawings gives just three steps, and the beginning step is very complex--there is no help in figuring out what basic shapes go into it, and it seems like the only thing you can do is copy exactly what the author has done. I wanted something that would teach me to draw this type of character, and instead I just got a book showing off the author's drawings. If it is supposed to be just a showcase, it should be called that--don't try to fool people into thinking it is a way to learn anything."
4,Good for basic application.,There are several sections that are helpful when drawing robots. Design styles and other elements of character creation are minimal. Good starting point for drawing Mecha!
3,Nice but wish Millie's OTHER CD was in print!,"This is a nice time-capsule 80s soul album, but I really wish Island would re-issue Millie's other amazing mid-80s soul album, LOVE ME RIGHT, as it's been OOP for two decades - c'mon guys, recognize your market!"
4,Don't leave home without it,"Bought this book and I don't leave home without it when I travel to Italy. My friends have even borrowed it for their trips.If you have food allergies, you should have this book to help you know what ingredients are in the food you are eating.Also it helps to explain the differences in types of foods, regional foods, the courses served.Educate yourself before exploring Italy's food with this great book.It's sized to fit in a pocket, or easily in your travel bag, takes no room at all. It's a must for travelers."
2,Don't waste your money,We bought this prior to our trip to Italy. The idea was that it would / could / should help us to order at restaurants while there. Yeah... that was wishful thinking I guess. Most of the things that we looked for weren't there. Most of the things that were in the book weren't on the menu or were named / presented quite differently in context. It didn't help us at all and we quickly abandoned it. Save your money.
4,Reasonable purchase,"I was able to install the FIPK kit quickly and easily. I picked it over AEM because it had dyno results in writing as opposed to the AEM brute force that just said ""horsepower gains"". The sound difference was minimal, which was nice for long drives, maybe a tad better rumble. Overall, however, almost no difference could be felt. A slight increase in throttle response, but not any better pickup as I have experienced with AEM intakes. The K&N though is a good product, quality made. It may add the 18 hp it claims, it is just harder to feel on a 350hp engine as opposed to the AEM i had, which gave 12 on a 250 hp engine. Very happy with my purchase to be honest."
1,Bad new age music.,"Ew. i bought this on a whim, thinking it was HollAnd, the indie rock band, and was definitely surprised at first listen. This is just badly synthesized songs. Imagine one beat, extremely simple. Loop it for 3.5 minutes. Lay a few synths over it, some keys, a piano track, and maybe a fake choir. I'm a huge fan of electronic music, but this sounds like it should be the soundtrack to Oregon Trail. Go ahead and listen to the preview tracks before you buy. This music might work for you, but it definitely didn't do it for me."
3,bahhhhh,"It was pretty expensive for a resin, chineese-made toy. But it was a gift for somone special so i paid it. Good quiality though...it seems like it could survive a fall or 2."
1,Sesame Street Bobber Cookie Monster,"This is a useless toy. Basically, it is an item to put on a dresser. It is hard and only the head moves. It is not meant for playing, only showing. For children, this is a waste.Karen Nemet-Nejat"
5,What? The arm DOES NOT fall off,"I don't know why people are saying that Alan's (the dad's) arm falls off because I've had this doll for quite some time and even when I toss him in my Barbie Moter Home from my hight 5""1 it DOES NOT fall off. But this doll is very cute, and I love how Alan and Ryan's clothes match. This does not look like your typical Ken doll, Alan has those lines you get around your cheeks when you smile and has that awsome highted hair look you get in the summer (not that green color you get from the pool the good one, from the sun). So I think if you have or want Midge, the Alan and Ryan set are a must. And also, that so called icky hair spray is not sticky or wet, it is there so you don't mess up his awsome hair, and if you have a problem with his hard hair you can rinse it out with water a couple of times it's just fine. : )"
3,"Hate to be negative, BUT","My 3 year old daughter accidentally dropped the father portion of this set and the arm from the elbow down, broke right off. My daughter is 3 feet tall. From a height of 3 feet, this doll shouldn't break. Furthermore, the head on this was very loose from the day we got it. It was always looking like it was going to come off. The hair on these two dolls has been covered in hard glue. So, it's icky and you can't comb it. My daughter only used these two as escorts ""to the ball"" for her Barbie and Kelly dolls anyway. They weren't major players in her mind. Just bit characters. Anyway, good luck with the whole durability thing. These two probably won't last long."
3,Well...,I have two daughters ()and they LOVE playing Barbies together. They were both begging for the 'Dad' for their 'Happy Family' dolls. My (child)got this for her birthday and within 10 minutes the head poped off. I put the head back on but it usually only stays on for a few minutes and they are asking back to me to put it back on again.
1,Wonderful first time changes,"I just obtained the Alan & Ryan set last Sunday. And while Ifound the boy more or less typicial. Of Mattel's children dolls,there are two things about Alan. That I've never known them todo with a male doll. Particularly a married one with rooted hair.It was such a relief to have him wearing a wedding ring. I justwish the ring had gone all the way around both sides of hisfinger. The other was that they put some absolutly gorgeoushighlites in his hair. I've been collecting Mattel's ""fashiondolls"" for years.And I've never seen them do this with a mail doll with rootedhair before. And I think it looks exquisite. But I really suredo wish that they'ed back of big time. On the amount of hairspray they use on their mail dolls with rooted hair. They useway too much, to the point where the hair's as hard as concrete.Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing."
4,While the album is great ... important information for the buyer,"Momus is a classic musician. A great wit pervades almost all of his songs, and penetrating lyrics are in everything else. I highly recommend his music to anyone who has not heard it, but be warned it is deemed quite offensive to most.HOWEVER, the reason for this review is that I purchased the item viewed on this page and it does NOT come with the tracks promised. Unfortunately only the first fifteen tracks are included with kareoke versions of nine of the others. This is NOT what I paid $22.50 for, and I don't want anyone else fooled."
1,I don't get it.,"I have purchased this CD because of the positive reviews, willing to overlook the few 'haters', but in this case, every negative review is accurate. Read someone else's to get the details, not worth the effort even to pan it."
1,what a JOKE,"how in heaven's name did this product get such a good review? i just received one, as a gift -- and i'm sending it back! there's no way in the world one can cook anything larger than french-fries in it -- the effective cooking oil depth is LESS THAN TWO INCHES; forget cooking chicken, fish or shrimp! the flimsy stainless-steel vessel and frame couldn't possibly retain heat OR shield one's countertop from the approximately-400-degree heat. i challenge anyone to get 3 3/4 pounds of ANYTHING in it!!!"
4,Good home fryer,It fries great ... oil temp stays uniform and buield up of flour and crumbs doesnt effect the raised elements . My only complaint now that we had it days under a year is the magnetic saftey electical chord now has to be jiggled and played with to make contact. Can be very annoying to have to play with it for 15 min to cook or loses contact while cooking
5,excellent!,"This unit is great. It's made much better than the last deep fryer I had. The only problems are - cord is too short, and that battered food sticks to the wire basket. I tried to spray it with nonstick spray, but to no avail. But, it heats up quick and performs great. Also, it requires about a gallon of oil for each use! It says you can save and reuse the oil, but that's pretty disgusting once you see the oil after you're done."
5,5 star fryer,"Who ever designed the waring pro deep fryer should get an A+I did my homework before buying a fryer for my home and theWaring pro lives up to its name. The unit heats up fast andHolds temp very well for a home unit, Cooks all foods perfectnot greasy at all.. And the cover makes for little or no mess.Clean up is a breeze, I used to be a chef and i know whatsits like to clean a restaurant fryer..I would recommend thisunit 100% alot of thought went into every feature... This isA keeper."
4,"Good fryer, watch the handle","We have had this fryer for 3 years now and have been very happy with it. I only fry outdoors to keep the smell out of the house (yes, it's cold frying stuff in the winter). Like another reviewer, we melted the handle. Since it stores in the oil, it should be made out of ABS or something else that is heat tolerant. The part# is 026653 and is available from Waring for about seventeen dollars. I do wish the temp went above 375 and the timer announces the end of the frying session with a single unsatisfying ding that you had better be listening for. Overall, though, it does fry well as long as you don't overload the basket."
4,Great Fryer!,"All of the positive comments I read in other reviews prior to buying this fryer turned out to be correct. This fryer is very well thought out- cooks fantastic food. The first thing I tried was fried chicken tenders, and it was honestly the best fried chicken I have ever had!I love the way that it all disassembles for simple cleaning. Only improvement would be an inner basket that prevents sticking.Otherwise- got a GREAT deal, and am very impressed with this fryer. Buy this one!"
3,Power Cord,After about a year of using our deep fryer the contacts on the power cord ruined. I've yet found a location to purchase parts for this unit. For the amount of money paid and the time it lastest cheaper ones have lastest longer. I contacted the manufacture and they sent me a new cord free of charge.
1,Cord failure on model DF200,"We liked the performance quality of the Waring Pro Deep Fryer, but we've only used it a handful of times to find the magnetic power cord won't keep a connection.I would not recommend purchasing model number DF200 or any other model number with this cord type! It was an expensive product purchase for no longer than it lasted."
5,WARING DF200 PRO FRYER,"THIS IS A GREAT FRYER! I ATE MORE FRIED FOODS WITHIN A WEEK OF RECEIVING THIS FRYER THAN I NORMALLY EAT ALL YEAR! IT'S A WINNER! AND,ASIDE FRM BEING GOOD LOOKING AND GREAT QUALITY, IT HAS SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT FEATURES THAT I'VE NOT SEEN OFFERED IN OTHER HOME-USE FRYERS. I'M LOVING IT!!!"
1,"Well, I don't see any reviews of a fryer after a year of use...","And you can rest assured, that your fryer will not last past that. Mine did not. One day, about a year after my purchase, the on/off switch just stopped working.No more fryer. Just a doorstop. My advice is to purchase a fryer that's going to last. I probably used this fryer 15 times in the last year, and that's obviously 1 time too much.If you think I'm unlucky, then go ahead and buy it! Just remember, you were warned."
5,best damn fryer on the planet,"this is a well thought out product for consumer use. easy to clean, easy to use. tried others and was very disappointed but i'm extremely pleased with this one. some advice stay away from the euro-pro."
3,Cord is ridiculous,"The cord on this deep fryer does not work propoerly. It has to be messed with everytime I use it. Then it goes on and off. This week it quit working completely. This is the 1st and last appliance I buy with a breakaway cord. The fryer itself cooks food excellent, once I can get the unit to stay on, because of this cord."
5,Waring DF200 Deep Fryer,I have used this product 3 times and have enjoyed it. I cooked about 4 lbs of cube steak in less than 35 minutes. It has a nice large capacity and heats up quickly. Overall I am very happy with this purchase.
2,Consumer-Grade Junk,"Effective when it works, but the unit ended up in the shop a week after we got it when it failed to power up. After a couple of months, the repair shop finally got the replacement parts, installed them & we got the unit back. Still, the power was intermittent, remedied by a couple of good whacks to the unit. After a year and a half of service, the unit finally died. Like I said, when it worked, it was very effective, but this is a chincy knock-off of a professional deep fryer. If you're serious about cooking, stay away from consumer-grade junk like this."
1,JiGgY,hey this bike really sucks i tired a couple of tricks it is heavey and i think if u want to do tricks u have to take some weight off cuz its all allumium it cnat preform well oh yeah becareful with this bike the brakes mess up easy and people will try to steal it from u
2,not right,The book I was looking for was the one exactly as pictured. What I received was a later edition with a different cover. I would have returned it but it was too late as it was a gift that was date sensitive.
2,"Good for the expert user, not so good for the novice!","I have had Microsoft Outlook on my home computer and only recently decided to start using it for no particular reason except that Windows 98 brought my attention to it in that it has a cut down version of Outlook. I purchased the Field Guide to Microsoft Outlook 97 sometime ago but I never got around to reading it until now. I found that while it covers a lot of areas in depth it misses items such as customised forms which I feel is important to the expert user and eventually to the novice user after he or she finds their way around. I am a long time user of other Microsoft Products such as Word, Access, Excel and Visual Basic and as such am very familiar with the navigation of Microsoft Products. I feel that if I were to be a complete beginner the field guide would not be the place to start."
3,If You Need a Quick Reference Guide,"PowerPoint97 offers the same insightful answers as its sister books from Microsoft Press. With over 160 pages, the reader can quickly find almost any topic related to PowerPoint.This is really a pocket guide. For the novice, it will help you look at the right help topics within PowerPoint's built-in help. For experts, it is a quick reminder."
2,what a joke,Karl is the greatest fiction writer of all time....after all he is the one who managed to fit 5 people on an AH 64 Apache. Anyone who can do that must be the best writer in the world...WHAT A JOKE
1,"""Good Plot, Poor Execution""",Very little drama in this story. The author failed to deliver a sense of crisis. The characters were not very captivating and some of the situations were not very credible. Several run-on sentences also made for a bumpy read.
2,NO DON'T BUY.,YOU MAY WANNA BUY IT CUZ THEY ARE 5 PRETTY GIRLS AND YOU THIK IT'S GONNA BE A GREAT SONG...THINK AGIAN.IT IS HORRIBLE.I WOULDN'T WASTE MY MONEY.REMIX IS OK BUY RADIO EDIT.NOOO DON'T BUY.
4,"More like 3 1/2 stars, but closer to 4","This is a really decent collection of songs. ""How You Do"", ""Good Service"", and ""Hollywood Bride"" are all varied, inventive, catchy and fun. What this album lacks is a really good mix and a bit of production. Although electro mixes are notoriously dry, this one sounds like it went straight from the computer to cd. The songs sound a little dead as a result. There are also times where a few backing vocalists might have helped to flesh things out a bit. These criticisms aside, Mt. Sims writes great songs and deserves a wonderful future in pop! This album would be a welcome addition to a collection that includes Fischerspooner and Ladytron."
2,"Some decent points, but a combative approach...","Dr Wheaton goes through great lengths to prop himself up in this book, but doesn't cite any sources in the text, making his over-generalizations (""All rock musicians"", ""Any city"", etc) fall flat.He mocks and berates people who do not do music according to his preferred style, and this negative air left a very bad taste in my mouth. If he were truly trying to contribute to intelligent discourse on the subject, he would have taken a different approach. This book is aimed at people who already feel the way the author feels and want to point to a book by an ""expert"" to back up their position.It is an interesting read if you can keep your cool. Buy it used."
5,A Kids CD for Parents too,"I was raised with an appreciation for the American Musical, and I am pleased that my children also love this music. The songs are great, and the Kids are certainly talented. I am particularly pleased that we can all understand the words to the songs. These are the CDs that my kids ask for over and over."
3,Some exceptionally good talent but....,"This CD overall is OK with the exception of some VERY nasaly-sounding solos (like ""Broadway Baby"") and akward voices (like the song from ""Pippin"") the only kids on this CD that I think are exceptionally talented are Joanna Pacitti and Cassidy Ladden. I don't like the boy who sings ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" or the girl who sings ""Broadway Baby"". I think ""Broadway Baby"" would've been better sung by Cassidy Ladden. Some of the solos in ""Jellicle Cats"" are so nasaly it makes me cringe. Eden Riegel's solo in ""Bye Bye Birdie Medley"" bothers me for the fact that she's 17 when she made the Cd and sounds like shes 4 or 5 whe she sings. Does she do that on purpose to sound younger? She sounds horrible! The best songs on this CD are ""Seasons of Love"" and ""I Feel Pretty"". The rest are just nasaly and annoying. [....]"
1,Stay away from this one!,"The Broadway kids Cd was recommended to me by my voice trainer. Since I am 13 years old, and my voice isn't fully devoloped yet, my voice teacher suggested I try singing songs sung by children. I purchased the Broadway kids Cd, and was so absolutely horrified when I put it into my Cd player. I couldn't believe anyone would ever listen to these ""talented"" children who sound like they have hairbrushs up their noses. The only song on this terrible arrangement of Broadway mishaps worth listening to is Anything you can do, and that's only because Ashely Pettet was givin so few solos on the Cd, that you barely notice she's singing anyways. The Broadway kids back on Broadway is the biggest embarrasment to Broadway that I have ever heard. It is most definetly not a must for any family, and I hope that these children get real jobs so that the world won't have to painfully listen to these talentless chimpunks sing ""with heart"" ever again."
2,There are many better books than this one.,Chapter Zero is useless for self-study and near useless when used for a class. There are hardly an examples of what a solid proof should look like and no answers to any of the exercises. Its avoidance of a formal approach to proof actually makes understanding what is going on far more difficult than it needs to be; unless you already have a background in logic it would be difficult to fill in the necessary information. I also find it shocking that the chapter on logic does not even mention validity and gives a very muddled explanation of what a statement is. This book should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
1,Horrible Textbook,"I took an intro to higher mathematics course my sophomore year of college that used this book. It was horrible. I'm a math major who doesn't have much trouble with simple concepts but this book some how makes it more more difficult than Wikipedia to understand theorems. Half of which are left to the reader to ""prove"" on their own. It offers no answers to any problems within in the chapters and most of the follow up questions are horribly worded and only serve to confuse the reader rather than aid him. The notation was sloppy and confusing and the section on equivalence relations turned a relatively simple definition into the davinci code. Needless to say I'm a little aggravated at this book. It was left to the professor to define and guide us through the course. STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK."
2,Not enough worked out examples and proofs.,"If you are buying this book as an independent learning tool, you will be severely disappointed. I only give this book 2 stars because it is not designed for independent learning. However, even for a class textbook, a book needs to work out more examples (or give more solutions) than this book does. Unless you have someone well-versed in math working out these problems for you as you go along, you are likely to have faults in your proofs and if not you are likely to lack confidence in the accuracy of work as you work through this book. The book provides a ton of proofs and examples for YOU to work out. Good luck! I cannot recommend this book."
1,Not good for the independent learner,"This book is proabley the worst text book I have ever encountered. If your like me and you take the majority of you learning into your own hands, you'll find this book very frustrating. The descriptions of various mathmatical ideas are short and far from complete, the book is almost completely devoid of examples. To know if your correct when attempting any of the problems is near impossible without outside help. If your taking this in university as a course, missing a class could result in falling behind with no way of catching up. I would not recomend this book to anyone unless they seriously want to struggle with material that could be explained in a much easier way."
3,Patterns for a Purpose with Student Access to Catalyst,"Alright book, purchased for daughter as it was required.Served its purpose but not something that my daughterwant to keep."
2,I agree with the above ..,"I agree with the above review. I found explanation of structure to be fairly good, however, the stories were as described. It does seem politically motivated. Homosexuality & Religion, A poor attempt at Spirituality, Racism (actually a good piece by W.E.B. DuBois) etc. I would stick to the Bedford Guide and leave Philosophy, Theology and Sociology to their respective studies. In addition, it does not have Turabian styles included in this manual this you will have to purchase separately."
4,Smart and Sensible Book for All Who Want to Achieve Wealth,"""As a Mom Thinketh"" combines sensible business advice with Biblical principles that will enable any family to become financially sound. The book is not just for moms. Any parent or even a single adult can benefit from this book."
3,Okay... But it gets Boring,"It reminds me of September 11, 2001. You bomb Bomberman if you're playing as Wario and if you're playing as Bomberman, You bomb Wario! What fun! Kinda though. It gets old if you play it for like 20 mins. As you advance though levels you have to bomb duplicates if the characters.Pros:Power ups that make your bomb explode farther and have powerups that you can place more bombsCons:Game can get boring and hard."
5,Kai-Lan's great trip to China,I am glad to purchase it. Good order and received it fast. Kids love the program and worth the money for 3 dvd in a pack. Will get more of other titles.
5,Better than original,"This is my second battery. I've replaced both my 5 year old Makita (NiMi)batteries with these. They work better than the original Makitas which did not hold their charge in cold weather and where kind of lame in holding their charge. This battery makes my Makita drill seam like brand new again. Excellent product and works well with the Makita charger. I should add that power tools have come down considerably since I bought my Makita. I can get an entire 4 piece professional tool set with 3 batteries for about the same price that I paid for a drill, a flash light and 2 batteries, and with a heck of a lot more power to boot. I still love my Makita drill though. And the flashlight bulb is 5 years old and has never been replaced."
2,VERY SLOW,"I'm not sure why, but I can't agree with the other reviews. It is a good idea, but so very slow and too much info and not enough action. I was really hoping for it to be more along the lines of Alex Kava or Lisa Gardner, but not the case for me. I had to skip through parts and just skim along because the pace was just exhausting:("
3,good first novel,"Although a good effort, the author still has a way to go, in order to write a first=class thriller. The main character, police woman Nan Vining, obsesses over her near death experience, and the current murder of a policewoman may be linked. However, it's clear early, that there is no linkage, and a second book must be forthcoming. Hope it's a thriller."
5,Especially well done,"Ms. Emley is a gifted story teller and writer. She is especially talented in developing characters and in fleshing out relationships among and between them. First Cut opens with Nan Vining, a Pasadena cop, returning to active duty after recovering from a near fatal stabbing. With the perp still at large she wills herself into nailing the psycho who killed Frankie Lynde in a brutal stabbing. Same guy? Copy cat? Frankie was a bit of a free spirit, but she was a friend and a good cop. Still wrestling with the terror of her own recent attack, she presses ahead. The incorporation of T.B. (The Bad) Mann as the continuing reminder of the stark evil she vows to bring down was a very clever aspect of the story.The story grabed me all the way and was loaded with some great detective work and an uncommonly vivid portrayal of folks ""on the job""."
1,Slow & boring,"Way to slow developing the story.I gave up after 100 pages,most of which dealt with the main character's fears .This is only the second book I have every given up onI do not understand all the other great reviews this book receivedI bought the book bases on the comments on the back cover,especially those of Michael Connelly,who is one of my favorites.I will not use him as a yardstick any longer on authors I have never read ."
5,Don't you just love Nan Vining?,"The First Cut: A Nan Vining Mystery by the wonderful Diane Emley is in a word, 'Wonderful'.This book introduces a female Police Officer by the name of Nan Vining. Not only is she an Officer, she's a single mom of a teenage daughter. There are some great reviews posted here so I won't repeat the plot. I will say, that this is an amazing suspense, thriller, with lots of action and real life insights. I have read all Diane's books and her storylines and characters that she creates are brilliant. I highly recommend not only this book, but all the author's books. 5 Stars for sure."
1,Awful product... buyers beware!,"I'd give this product ZERO stars if that was an option. I picked up one of these at Sam's Club about five months ago and I couldn't be more disappointed. The dispensing mechanism for the cold water is made of soft plastic, so the bottled water your paying good money for ends up tasting toxic by the time you dispense it. It tastes lie you're drinking liquid plastic. What's the point in making a cooler that makes your water taste so bad that it is undrinkable? The company's response to all of this is that the plastic taste will go away eventually. After nearly six months of use it is still as awful tasting as day one. Stay away from Addi and Addico coolers and find one with a ceramic or stainless steel dispensing reservoir."
5,Lampshade,I ordered a lampshade through Amazon and it was received in good condition and in a timely fashion. I am very pleased with my purchase.
4,School Bus,"My granddaughter has a lot of fun with this picking up and dropping off her ""friends and animals""."
2,school bus,Wonderful toy but to small. The figuers should be a little bigger to prevent swollenings. They should be about the size of the old figures.
3,Mussolini,"The story centers mostly around the Mussolini family, and is obviously kinder to Mussolini than was history. George C. Scott, makes a better Mussolini than he did as Patton. Originally made as a mini-series, the DVD format is poor and in one hour segments with the introduction inserted at many of these segment. The video is some of the worst transfer I have ever seen. While viewing a few of the sections,so far out of focus, I wondered if the studio that produced this DVD ever watched it before placing it on the market? The sound is mostly good, but there are no sub-titles to help through the dialog. I give this 3-stars for acting and the subject matter. This is a not a work of history, but a drama based upon a Son's understanding of his father."
5,Perfect mix of Christmas and Holiday music,"Excellent arrangements at about the intermediate level, with the perfect mix of what you could call ""traditional"" in Christmas/Holiday music. One of the very best in print. Big, crazy thumbs up from CleverJoe."
5,A throw-back to the good old days!,"This is first-class singing of standards and new material that takes you back to the best. She may not be Ella or Carmen, but she's her own woman and a great singer."
3,"Songs are good, but video quality is poor","Sade's performance itself was soulful, and the band was in good form. So the songs themselves were very good, as I expected. But the video quality on this DVD is poor, almost VHS-like. I have dozens of live concert DVDs, and none of recent vintage (from late 1990s onward) were this poor (I have a 2006-model 50"" Panasonic plasma). Grainy and pixelated. So I often just play the DVD like a music CD."
1,Sting wax action figure review,This toy is awful. It looks like a Disneyland Parade reject and what's with the pink cape? It also looks like he's passing gas and trying to hide it by poseing. I give this toy a -0 out of 10.
2,not as good as it sounds....,i dont know if it were the language or the boring story...so i cant review this book(i stoped reading it after like 90 pages)all i can say is boooring!
5,Best eye pencil ive come across yet,"I use this eyeliner along my bottom line. When I line my eyes I apply it ON the line, not beneath it. With that said, yes it does get a little smudged but what can you expect for applying it IN your eye? I have tried many different eyeliners and this lasts by far better than others that i used to use. So far I am 2 years stuck on this pencil which says alot being that I am OBSESSED with buying/trying new makeup."
4,Good. But better would be great!,"I was hoping that this eyeliner would end the search. It will do but I wish there was some kind of eyeliner that was more permanent without getting permanent makeup. ;) That being said, it's up there with the best I've seen yet."
4,Great Purchase,was not crazy about the price but glad i decided to purchase it wears well not much smudging easy to put on purchased the black now looking forward to more colors overall a great buy
2,Doesn't work that well,"I was disappointed with this eyeliner. It does not go on smoothly or evenly. After several attempts, I gave up using it and went back to my old eyeliner."
5,Best Eyeliner Ever!,"This is a great eyeliner line, Make Up Forever, goes on very smooth & stays on, and all the differentcolors are great, my favorite is the Black Purple, it's a smokey dark mauve more than purple when itgoes on the eyelid. There's also a beautiful moss/hazel eyeliner color, if you have hazel eyes or youare a redhead, it looks awesome!"
2,BAD EDIT . . .,"I have the Original of this on VHS. This is a badly edited copy, with a lot of the original material missing.There is Nothing about the History of the MENUDO group on this DVD."
1,Avoid this CD - very poor quality sound!,"While this is a reasonable compilation of some of Ray Conniff's popular recordings of the 1960s and 1970s, the sound quality is absolutely dreadful.Sony Discos does NOT use the original masters for their compilations. In an effort to clean up the sound, they destroyed these recordings. They all sound bad but the strings on ""Nadia's Theme"" suffer the most.What is strange is that Sony Discos released an identical CD in 1996 under the title 20 DE COLECCION. Although that one had sound problems too, they were not nearly as prominent as on this collection. Why they tampered with the sound is anyone's guess.All of these songs have been released on CD with wonderful sound by Columbia/Sony. Avoid Sony's Latin label!"
3,Warning! NOT a Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz CD!,"This is actually a tribute album by the group ""Lo Maxima de la Salsa"" called ""Descarga Pa' Bailar,"" featuring the hits of Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz.That said, it's a good salsa record--it just doesn't have the ferocious energy and dynamics of the actual records by Bobby and Richie."
4,Heavy pads,"I actually use these for mild urinary continence. I like this brand because it is compact and either doesn't have wings, or if does have them, they are intrusive; so much so that I can't remember whether they are there or not. The pad has a natural feeling not a synthetic one."
3,Companion to Startup Business Chinese,"As a companion to startup business chinese the exercises expand and force applicability to what's learned in the lessons. I've seen a few typos here and there, but its good work overall if you have already purchased the book."
3,Great book!,I think this book is a interesting take from a man who spent his career in both VERY public and VERY private schools. Worth reading if you are at all interested in education. One size does not fit all!
3,Pretty good - if you've never heard Billy Mayerl before,"Caramia's playing is pretty good, but a bit too straight and academic. If you want to hear the real thing, look for reissues (or original 78s) of Billy Mayerl, Rae Da Costa, Frank Banta, Willie Eckstein or Zez Confrey. For for a terrific contemporary pianist playing in the novelty-syncopated idiom, listen to CDs by Alex Hassan."
2,not feeling it with this one,"This is one of 3 doors down's lesser songs by far. I hate the melody and the chorus gets old in the blink of an eye. Regrettably this hit is nothing like the rock of Kryptonite or When I'm Gone, and did not deserve its success on the hit list. Don't get the single."
1,did not work,"I recieved and unpacked the item..assembeled and charged the battery according to the instructions. Would not start, the switch had a rattle.I returned the saw to Amazon and still have not recieved a refund,its been over a month.. The box was banged up I should have suspected something wrong [ups is not a favorite delivery of mine]. I do own the black and decker string trimmer battery powered and am very happy with its performance. I did not purchase that from Amazon.. I am doubtful I will make any more purchases...I had a hard time just trying to find out how to return the item, could not even find phone number..All in all a dissapointing experience I am not anxious to repeat.."
1,why it does not work any more?,"Many buyers rated 4-5 stars and they are very lucky.I hate that I rate it 1 star. I would like to change my rate if this chain is working again.I bought it about 1 year on amazon.com.It was working for several cuts. But it suddently became not working. I thought the chain had problem so I bought two new chain. It still not working. I started to think about the battery. I bought another two batteries. It is still not working: the chain is moving but it can not cut anything. The snow last week crashed several tree's sticks. I tried to use it to cut them. But it does not working.I checked the review and nobody mentioned the same problem.Anyone can help resolve this problem?If the problem is resolved, I would change my rate.Thank you very much.(When you comment my revew, your comment would send to my email. Thanks in advance)"
5,Black a& Decker Cordless Electric Pole Saw,I used the saw to cut limbs up to 6 in diameter and was impressed with the ease and speed of operation. I used both the short pole and the extended pole.
3,"Gas operators, temper expectations","This product can only handle short bursts of use. I have only ever used gas operated saws, so it was an adjustment to use it for 10 minutes and then be unable to cut because of a weakened battery. It cuts well on a full charge and is of solid consturction. However, it is certainly not meant for continuous use (it even says so in the manual - 10 minutes at a time). I would not recommend it to anyone with more than an occasional limb to cut down."
4,Good Deal,"I have to say that this is a cool saw. I've used it to trim limbs around my house and around the road at my Dad's place. It cuts really well and is easy to use. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the battery life seems a little shorter than what I'd read in the description. If you have some trimming that you know you'll be doing every once in a while from now on, get it. If you're trimming a forest, better buy something else."
5,Black and Decker Hit a Home Run,"We have a large property with many mature trees. They require a lot of trimming to keep looking their best. This unit does the work of two people using regular trimming saws including large chain saws.When I first received it I treated very gently as I was not sure of its durability. After just a few minutes of use I knew that I had a good, rugged tool in my hands.My neighbors borrow it frequently. Wish they would purchase their own!This is a five star product!"
1,sad,"I am very sad to have wasted my money to purchase this item. I have already had to replace the end piece that the chain goes on and now the chain won't stay on. I felt that purchasing a ""Black & Decker"" that I was making a good choice in my investment but I am sad about that choice. I have not used this product for more than was intended either that again is sad. In the advertisement of this item it said not to use on more than 5-6 inch diameter, funny thing...what I have cut was nothing near that size. I will choose differently and pay more if needed to get what tools I need. No more Black & Decker junk."
3,"good chain saw, poor ergonomics","I'll likely not recommned this for other than upright use. This is a very uncomfortable, awkward tool to handle when using the extension pole-insert in positions other than upright. At over 12 feet in length, the heavy parts are at each end of the tool (chain saw at one end with lightweight pole length in the middle, then the battery/handle at the other WITH the requirement to always have your finger on the trigger, no locking). I'm strong; however, I badly injured my elbow and forearm muscles and tendons upon the first use. I needed this tool to do lateral trimming across a large hedge top. Using it to hold upright, to cut a tree limb or similar is a much less awkward use and seems a better fit for the tool. I'll never again use the tool's 4-ft extension rod for later trimming--thus, for me an 8-ft tool and unhappy because I purchased it for the 12-ft. length/option."
1,Will Not Cut 1 inch Branches,"I returned the Pole Chain Saw after only 5 minutes of operation. It labored trying to cut through a 1 inch branch. It took so long that I gave up, and picked up my dull old bow saw, which cut quickly and easily. Do not buy this item."
4,Ok for small jobs,"Well made, sturdy and it's able to cut through some tough branches. I bought it to trim my palm trees. The battery goes fast and you need to oil the chain often. Buy some extra batteries so you can finish the job in one day."
5,18V Cordless Pole Saw,"I purchased this saw so that I would not have to climb the trees with a chain saw. It works very well on older/thicker branches. It ""dances"" quite a bit on young, green branches; requiring a bit more strength to steady it while it is extended. The battery life is quite good, and it is interchangeable with other Black & Decker 18V slide batteries. Follow the instructions regarding oiling the chain and adjusting the chain, especially during the first few hours. Some have commented on the oil dripping; I have not had that experience. The saw comes with a blade cover that has storage areas for the chain adjusting tool and the bottle for the oil; very clever. It also comes with a sturdy carry bag in which the entire tool & accessories fit. B&D put a lot of thought into this saw. It is well worth the cost. I recommend it."
4,Great tool!,"I'm a single woman with lots of old trees that needed trimming back from my house and garage. I'm intimidated by heavy chainsaws, plus not wild about climbing up on a ladder with one. My son isn't available very often to trim trees for me, so I decided to try this pole saw. I could hardly wait for the battery to charge overnight to give it a try. When I did, I was able to clear out in one evening a fourth of the tree limbs that had been bothering me for years. I've even cut down a small tree with it. The only complaint I have with it is that the battery runs down pretty quickly, after an hour or two, but I have to admit that I do, too. This could be alleviated by ordering an extra battery. I'd definitly recommend it. I'll probably buy the cordless weed eater next; I understand the batteries are interchangeable. But first I have to trim my friends' trees."
4,Black and Decker Cordless Pruning Saw,This is a handy little chain saw. Very useful for trimming small branches and topping fruit trees. Wish I had it years ago.The only problem is the chain slipped up against the plastic housing and jammed requiring taking the entire assembly apart to repair. Make sure the chain is tight.Battery life is not great but adquate for smaller jobs.
3,Good tool but could be better balanced,"This tool is basically well designed and sturdy enough for home use. It breaks down into three convenient pieces for relatively easy carrage and/or storage. It has a well made carrying case.The one less than optimal aspect is that it's quite heavy/unbalanced toward the operating end even when not at full extention. My ""average sized"" wife finds it very difficult to use for more than a couple of minutes. At full extension (max angular weight) I find it uncomfortable to use for more than about ten minutes at a time. I'm seriously thinking of adding more weight to it at the handle end to counter balance. Although the total weight will increase it might be easier to use over all. At the end of the day I'm still happy with the purchase."
3,Can't find a replacement chain for the pole saw,"Overall, I liked the electric pole chain saw until my blade got dull. I figured it would be easy to find a replacement blade, but I can't find any place that sells it. I checked the Black & Decker website, other websites, major stores like Lowes and Home Depot, etc. Basically, the pole saw is now worthless to me if I can't find replacement blades.I'd give it a 4-5 if it wasn't for the difficulty finding a replacement blade."
2,chain tension a problem,"Relatively easy to assemble and use. You definitely need to order an extra battery as it only woks about 30 minutes/charge. Despite checking and adjusting the chain tension and oiling the chain with every use, the chain started falling off of the blade. I had to return the saw after the third use."
4,Works as Advertised,"This saw works as advertised. Easy to assemble and use and not hard to handle. I use the provided small bottle to manually oil the chain after each usage. The batteries are interchangeable with other B&D 18v products. The only limitation is the usage from the single battery before requiring a charge. I have two additional batteries, so this is not a problem for me , but could be for others."
5,Use this to stay off ladders.,"We have a very large Oak tree growing next to the house and I needed to trim high branches that were too close to the house, creating a fire hazard. This tool worked perfectly, allowing me to safetly cut the branches from the deck instead of trying to work from a ladder with a chain saw.I highly recommend purchasing an extra battery; working on large branches dishcarges the battery pretty quickly. Using two batteries, I was able to do everything I wanted to in about 1 1/2 hours."
4,easy to handle,"This saw was perfect for my needs easily cutting palms and smaller limbs, doesn't last long but I bought a second battery. It is extremely easy to handle for someone my size."
4,Cordless pole saw,"The product was received very promptly, with no problems.It assembles easily and cuts well. The Carrying bag is useful too.The only negative aspect is the ""oiler"". There is none.You are just supposed to drip oil on the chain-bar. That seems chintzy.Overall good tool."
4,"Black & Decker 18-Volt Cordless Pole Chain Saw, 8-Inch Bar #NPP2018",Great tool for homeowner that doesn't need a profrssional pole saw. Worth more than the price.
3,Not Long Enough,"I ordered this item from Amazon thinking it was 14 feet long based upon their blurb. I have a number of high Queen Palm branches that need that much length. However, when I put together the three units that comprise this item, it only was about nine feet long. I guess they think a very tall person could hold it over their head and perhaps reach 14 feet if they were lucky. To remedy the situation, I just contacted B & D and ordered an extra middle section for about $28 including shipping. We'll see if that does the job. I'll report back after it arrives and maybe then I will change my rating."
2,Chain jumps out of the groove frequently.,"Works okay for awhile, but chain jumps off all the time. Have tried new chain and tightening, but still comes off a lot. Get this product for the easy pruning, but be prepared to spend more time taking it apart and putting the chain back on, then you do actually cutting."
5,Wonderful tool,It really does the job! It is important to follow the user guide instructions before start using it. The saw must be set accordingly. Easy to operate and transport (nice bag included). Extremely recommended for a small/medium garden.
5,Great Tool,This was purchased to enable trimming of limbs too large for our manual pole pruner. My husband and I have been very pleased with how well it works. We have been amazed at how much power the battery provides and how long it lasts between charges. We were able to cut a six inch limb in a Chinese Elm that had cracked but not come down. I appreciate the carry bag provided which enables me to store all the parts neatly between jobs.
5,Works great,This got the job done. Make sure to check the tension of the chain prior to use...mine arrived a little loose. Then to oil it prior to use. It comes with a nice bag for all the extentions/parts.
3,black& decker battery poweredpole saw 18 volt npp 2018,"The saw is ok. I charged the battery 9 hours when i first got it, Iused it, it worked real well. I then charged it 6 hours and put it away. when i tried to use it again the battery was almost dead. I again charged it. It worked well. I again charged it and put it away, when I tried to use it again the battery was to low to use. thank you George Smith[...]959 desert st.Hawthorne Nev 8941P.s. it's ok I can live with it until I can order another battery."
4,Cut with ease,This pruner / mini chain saw cuts through thick branches as well as thin ones just like a hot knife through a stick of butter. I love this little tool! It has really speeded up & made cutting & pruning such a breeze! The only thing is to make sure you have extra batteries handy because cutting the thick branches greatly reduces the expected cuts the unit said you get per battery charge. I have 3 extra batteries from my other B&D tools that are the same and this really helps me finish the job without waiting for a charge up on one battery. I highly recommend getting one of these if you have a lot of trees to take care of. Enjoy!
4,Nice little saw,"I give this product 4 stars overall. If you already have B&D; 18v tools, or Firestorm tools, this is a nice addition to your sets.This pole chainsaw makes the dreadful task of using a pole saw a thing of the past. My first week having it, I pruned just one section of my trees. My DPW was not too happy with the amount of branches I left them.A few things that I do not like about this saw:1. No auto feed for chain oil.2. After about 1/2 hr of using, my chain became really loose. Unless I'm missing something, I was not able to get the chain as tight as I'd like it to be.Obviously the battery isn't going to last you too long. But if you have other 18v tools, you're aok.I would recommend to friends."
4,"Not bad, considering...","I bought this saw to prune a large hedge and the extension pole was quite handy. The saw cut fairly well (all things considered) my only gripe is the battery life was only about half and hour and I had at least 5 hours of cutting to do. Other than that, I was pleasantly surprised with the power and utility of this little saw. Even considering the relatively short battery life, it was worth it to me to not to have the loud noise and fumes of a gas chain saw."
4,Very good for occasional use around the home,"I am quite satisfied with this product for my purpose. I needed an inexpensive tool for occasional trimming of low-lying branches from my 12-15 trees. It works very well in this role. Note that because battery capacity is limited to 15 to 30 minute sessions before recharging, a more expensive gas powered unit would be better suited for frequent use.My unit arrived without one of the two screws clamping the bar and without the sprocket cover. However, B&D; parts department replaced these promptly at no charge."
3,Good routine trimmer,This is a good buy for not too lengthy high up trimming. You have to be careful about trying to cut too big limbs but for routine trimming it works well.
5,No disappointments here,"I am very pleased with this great tool. I have used it fully extended and at it shortest length, on thicknesses to 7 inches. The little rascal just chews its way through effortlessly. Perhaps a younger man would outlast the battery, but it suits me perfectly and I get plenty of work done. With the free shipping this tool is worth every penny."
5,Black & Decker NPP2018 18-V Cordless Electric Pole Chain Saw,"Black & Decker NPP2018 18-Volt Cordless Electric Pole Chain Saw:Its great tool for doing small yard work. I strongly recommend this who has yard and branches to cut. Easy to use, lite to cut high things. Good price and brand."
5,Does very well what it is supposed to do.,"If you need a heavy duty chainsaw, then consider a corded electric or gas powered. This is for light cutting and the battery drains quickly. However, it is light and effective and works great for trimming hard to reach branches. I like that you can remove a section of the pole, because most of the time the shorter length is enough for the job."
4,Cordless Chain Saw,"Cuts thru tree branches very good. It could be more powerful, such as 24 v. rating. More projects can now be done"
5,B&D 18V Cordless Pole Saw,"I always purchase a Christmas gift for myself of something I need. I reviewed all comments prior to purchasing. I found this to be extremely useful to me. I love the fact it is battery operated and that it could be handled fairly easy for a 65 yr old doing a lot of this outside work myself. At times it was a bit heavy when working on stuff for a long period of time as my shoulders and back seemed to bear the brunt of it. However, it did not splinter smaller branches if you followed the directions of the small cut at the underside of the branch first. On a lot of my stuff I have to kind of lean over a hillside to reach branches and it works fine. Nice cuts, reliable, glad for the battery as I can not handle gas or electric cutters. Gas ones are heavier and electric one always have to connect lots of cords to get through the wooded areas. Great product."
1,P.O.S.,"This saw is complete CRAP! I got this to take down dead lower branches on pine and willow trees on our land, out of state. What a joke! The batteries last about 10 - 12 minutes and we were just cutting down little branches, not trees! The extra battery got us up to about 20 minutes or so, total. Then it takes 6+ hours EACH to recharge them. We're talking virgin land. Not alot of electrical outlets out here. Unfortunately, I ordered this POS early enough that by the time we got to our land and found out how crappy the saw was, it was too late to return it. CAUTION! ! ! ! ! Do not waste your time or money on this one! Even getting a second battery for free doesn't make this a good deal."
1,2 Lemons,"Enough said: the first one lasted for 3 rather light usages and then completely died (it wasn't the battery, and I had to drive for 45 minutes each way to return and have it exchanged), got a new one under warranty, that lasted for one use. Unbelievable."
1,For VERY light work only,"Unfortunately, the motor of my unit burned up during the first day and first charge. I was cutting limbs off of a hackberry - only a couple were about three inches in caliper. While letting the blade rest on the top of the branch and slowly work its way through, the motor started smoking and seized. I barely got twenty minutes of use from my hundred some dollars. If you're only going to cut very small branches, one inch in size or less, then this tool might work for you."
2,Ten minutes is not enough,"We used 10 minutes cut couple six inch cuts and where done for six hours while charging batteries.**** TOOK THIS BACK **** Got the 10"" Remmington 1.4 HP Electric pole saw it WORKS GREAT. Used up ladder, ground work and took off pole cut two stumps ground level. Used 5 hours cut stacked pick up load of wood. Did sharpen once about middle of day two pass on each tooth with file, great improvement."
4,Light weight but low on power,"This pole saw has good reach and is easy to wield without having herculean strength. The only problem is the batteries do not last long. Maybe 2 cuts on a 7""D tree. I have 3 batteries from the other pole products which helps. I would not buy this product unless you had other batteries as it may take weeks to complete your project just charging batteries. It only really sticks when it is running low on juice, so just change your batteries at that time. I have little to compare this too not owning a gas powered saw, but I just cannot stand the fumes from them so here I am."
4,Another Good Product,This pole saw is another good product from Black and Decker. All you have to do is use it correctly and it will do what they say it will do. It is as simple as that. Make sure you run the saw BEFORE you put it on the tree limb. If you rest it on the limb as you turn it on it will not work as well. Overall another more than decent product from Black and decker.
4,Good small chain saw,"I have used this saw to cut branches as big as 6 inches in diameter. It is much slower than gasoline, but does not require the gas startup problem. I have owned 6 gas chain saws over the past 30 years and none are easy to start or to keep running.The saw is hard on the low capacity Nicad batteries, perhaps 6 cuts of 5 inch branches per charge. B & D would have done much better with NiMh batteries."
3,B&D cordless pole saw,THE POLE SAW WOULD BE 5 STAR IF IT HAD 2 BATTERIES AND A RAPID CHARGER. IT PERFORMS VERY WELL ON LIMBS UP TO 4 INCH DIAMETER.
3,Not sure why this got such a high rating,"Purchased this item and charged battery to use next day. The battery doesn't last nearly long enough. Not even close to finishing a tree. I had two other batteries and still was not able to finish trimming one tree. The largest branch was only approx 4"" thick, this is rated to cut up to 6"" branches. Too bad though, other than battery life this sucker really cuts with ease (with fresh battery) and is very light compared to the saw I replaced it with (corded). It also has a longer reach. I really liked the overall design. Too Bad!!! Got the job done quickly with Poulin 10"" 1.5hp Pole Saw. Sweet!!!"
3,It's probably just me...!,"The product description reads: ""Extends to reach up to 14 feet"". The actual extension is less than 9 feet from tip to tip. The ""up to 14 feet"" includes the user's height and arm extension. I returned mine because it didn't reach is high as I expected, and because the chain jammed after about 15 minutes of use. I tightened the chain up before first use, but did not continually check it, which apparently I should have. When it came off, it chipped one of the chain's teeth and also embedded itself into the plastic housing. I was unable to get it free and fix it. So basically, I broke it in under 20 minutes - oops! Thankfully, Home Depot took it back. With all that being said, it was fairly easy to use (given I'm only 5'4"") and it cut through large branches very easily. It did have a fair amount of kickback and bounced around on the branches, which caused me a bit of concern."
4,A good choice for the homeowner,"I have found this pole saw delivers what it promises to do and I am very pleased with my purchase. I was concerned it my not have enough power to do the job, but the reviews I read here reassured me it does. My experience is that it will cut up to about a dozen two inch limbs easily and still have enough power to help trim the debris on the ground for more easy disposal. it is easy to assemble and sturdy. It is not heavy or awkward to use. I would recommend this pole saw to any homeowner who wants to maintain his property.I also own a Black & Decker rechargeable string trimmer, hedge trimmer, and blower...all 18 volt rechargeables. All work well and provide me with backup batteries in case I run out of power. So far, a fully charged battery has let me do the complete job and I haven't had to interchange them. I have used the tools for about two months and have no problems with using them or maintaining them."
2,Had it less than 6 mos. and needs service?????,"Not happy!!! I guess i am getting what I paid for?? I need a pole saw and tired of using manual labor so I read online that for the $ was the best deal. I got it one day and tried to use it and got 35minutes out of it before it needed charged. Afterall, I tried to use it without it fully charged so I did without it the rest of the day and let it charge all night. Next day, it wouldn't run after charging more than 10hrs. Called service center sent me a new battery tried it and nothing!! So, I have up at the local repair center, they said charging unit and both batteries are good and to leave with them and they'll call me in 2-3wks!!! This might be going back very soon and go with the best STIHL!!!"
5,cordless electric pole saw,"bought this because I have other black and decker tools that uses the same battery. got rave reviews from all over the web. you have to oil the chain and bar about every ten minutes or so and check the tension also according to the manufacter. it is a little heavy at handle with the extra pole but no loud noise and cord to get in the way. comes with a bottle for the oil and the wrench, which attaches to the unit for convenience. recommend it for those trimmings around the house and yard. comes with it's on carrying bag too."
3,good saw but batteries die fast.,overall I'm happy I live on a property that is surrounded by valleys and so I wanted to trim back the sumac trees that are growing up the hill and wrecking the view.I went through them easily at first but found that between no oil being included and battery life (only 1/2 an hour tops) I had to keep going and charging the battery.The poles themselves are awkward and not rigid enough when you saw with any pressure you can acutally start to see the poles bending which isn't good because eventually the contacts will break.had they re-enforced the poles with a decent guage of piping and counterbalanced the saw it would be a great one.
3,Not Much...,"3 stars is stretching it...It was ok though for what little small limbs I needed to reach...A bit heavy on the long end, no way of actually getting the chain oiled right, but the biggest fault I had was the safety lock or whatever on the switch would get stuck and I could not shut it off... In other words another dangerous safety switch...Wound up taking the thing apart and removing that part of the switch and just having the trigger operate the thing... Mainly the price and the fact that I had 2 of the same batteries for a B&D; drill is why I chose it...I gave it 3 stars but 1 or maybe 2 would have been more appropriate... But thats about all you can get anymore, just cheaply designed and made junk...Have a good one...Tater..."
5,"NO Gas, NO Cords","This cordless chain saw is wonderful. No cords and the 18V battery stays charged longer than I thought it would. So easy, no electrical cords, no gasoline.........should had this for myself years ago. Makes life so much easier."
5,Great product,I have cut tree limbs and branches with ease the battery does last for about an hour of work but it is well worth it.
4,B & D electric pole saw,"I found this electric pole saw far easier to use than a Husky gas unit I have. It is half the weight, and reaches about two feet higher than the Husky. It is well balanced, and handles nicely. The battery pack will allow about 25-30 cuts for me; somewhat short of the 70 or so B & D claims (but I am cutting oak, 2""-3"" dia. limbs, which is probably not what B & D based its performance on). The only real inconvenience is that it does not have an integral chain oiler; you oil the chain via a supplied squeeze bottle. And keeping the chain oiled is vital to insure its long life. It is perfect for the casual home user; much quieter than a gas unit, no need to worry about keeping a gasoline/oil mix around, no gummed up carb from the lousy gasoline on today's market, and no worry about tuneups and spark plug changes. Just keep the battery charged and you are ready to cut."
3,Works well but charging takes forever,"This pole is great, but be sure your project is not too large. I would suggest 1 acre or less, and a fair amount of patience. The biggest problem with this saw assembly is the time it takes to recharge batteries - six to eight hours. I bought a couple of spare batteries, but I use up my battery power in an hour or so and can't use the saw until the next day when I've got a couple of batteries charged. This saw is good for intermittent trimming and small projects."
5,Works like a charm!,Black and Decker did a great job on this one. This pole pruner is easy to operate and really works like a charm. Easy to read instructions are great and I especially like the carrying bag for the whole thing.
2,Battery does not last,"Don't waste your money on this.All though the trimmer works,the battery last for 15-20 min. under light use.Purchased a back up battery,same issue. With a 9 hour charge time, can not complete any task.Go electric or gas."
3,Hoping I just got a bad one!,"I only gave this three stars b/c I had to return it after less than a month of owning it. The chain kept getting stuck and falling off. After a few times of this happening it wouldn't stay on at all and I noticed the top of the plate was stretched out. I am really hoping I just received a faulty saw, I returned it and am waiting for a new one to arrive. I did exactly as the instructions indicated as far as tightening but not over tightening, etc. I'll give the new one a try then update at a later point. I love the concept, it is easy for me as a woman to use vs a chain saw but if the chain doesn't stay in place then it's not good for anyone."
4,Cordless Electric Pole Chain Saw,"Does a great job for what it is designed to do, which is trim small branches. Don't expect to do a major pruning of all of your trees with this as it is a bit slow cutting. All the parts fit well together, but do tighten the chain tensioner lock nuts before using for the first time. They were loose on mine and the chain slipped off after the first few cuts."
4,Lots of power for its intended purpose & then some,"Looking for a way to cut higher branches too large for a rope-pull lopper, this is a great item. I'm encouraged at it's power and long battery life - both beyond what I was expecting. Do remember to oil the chain/cutter bar frequently, as others have mentioned. It'll be a happier helper. It cuts thicker (3 1/2"") boughs much more easily than I was expecting, with nary a protest. I'd get one again, for certain."
5,Fun and easy to do,"I was attracted to this video because of it's promise that even I could do these tricks. It has far surpassed my expectations, it's fun to watch and I've found unusual places to perform some ""miracles"".I tried the business card trick when I was handing my card to a client, it definately made an impression. We're having lunch again next week, every time I talk with him he asks how I did that thing with my business card.The best part, it only took me about five minutes to learn.The video is easy to follow, easy to watch, the performer that shows the tricks is fun, funny and presents the tricks in a way anyone can learn.Plus there are funny gags we've used in our fax machine.I highly reccomend this for anyone that wants to impress a client or have fun with magic!"
4,Worth the read!,"Mary Ann believes she is a happily married woman. However, she has always wondered where her life would have led her if she had taken a different path seven years ago, choosing a relationship with Robert instead of with her husband Brad. The three of them have remained close friends since college. Now, all three are vacationing together. Mary Ann wakes up one morning and is shocked to find that she is suddenly Robert's wife. She is forced to face some of her issues and finds what love means to her.This is a quick, easy-to-read romance, and I enjoyed getting to know the characters. The story is original and the descriptions of the beauteous scenery along Northern California's Hwy 1 add to the mystery and romance of the topsy-turvy relationships that Mary Ann struggles to come to terms with.Armchair Interviews says that this book had some surprising moments and will lead readers to wonder about the ""what ifs"" in their own romantic pasts."
1,Don't waste your time,"Without doubt, this is the worst piece of writing that I have ever read in book form. There is no real plot development, no character development; just an incredible amount of mundane verbosity between two covers. It reads like an adolescent diary. I could not believe that the ""manuscript"" could ever have been accepted by any publisher. When I checked out this book's publisher, I found that it comes from a self publishing company, which clears up the mystery of how this story got to print in the first place. I rated this book at one star only because there was no choice selection for less than that. Bottom line: save your money and your valuable time on this one."
4,Still relevant. The quizzes and worksheets are useful,"Manage Your Time, Your Work, Yourself was published in 1993 and you can still buy it new. That says a lot. While it doesn't cover managing email, it is relevant and has a great approach to some of the oldest time management problems such as prioritizing and balancing one's life.The quizzes at the beginning of each chapter are a great bell-ringer. Too bad I actually filled them out when I bought this book in 2001. But I didn't use the worksheets at that time and found them useful much later. Since time is such an abstract concept, good books on time management don't really get dated."
1,I wont buy this book because..,"I came to this conclusion when I was able to take a peek inside. Im not a huge star wars fan, but when does JODI tell luke he has the power to lift his ship from the muck. YODA is a JEDI....and I was pretty sure he was in the muck with Luke."
4,"No gadget, no illustration, no gimmick. Pure know-how","Merrill and Donna are in the ""time management business"". Because they work in Grandville (Michigan - USA) I was quite interested. Grandville is the closest harbor to my birth place. It was also Christian Dior birthplace and childhood paradise. This would not be enough to give 4 stars to this book. In fact, even if this book looks boring to me. Very classical typography, layout. No illustration. Despite of all these drawbacks professional experience of Merrill and Donna are very helpful and clearly distilled in this book. Buy it with Outlook 2000 software."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This is, without question, the worse book I have ever purchased. The pronunciation system utilized is awful! Simple words, those words one would expect would be represented in any dictionary, can't be found. What a disappointment."
2,Not worth it,I am born and brought up in Gujarat. Bought it for my American husband and this book does nothing. It is quite inaccurate and pronunciationguide is WRONG.
5,Can't wait to hear more!,"This is a great debut. Smooth vocals, great drums, and a guitar style that leaves you waiting for the next release. Can't wait to hear more from Eric Heatherly."
2,Statler brothers meets George of the Jungle,"The rest of the CD is pretty good but I can't get over how bad ""Flowers on the Wall"" was done. Don't know what producer convinced him that Statler Bros. lyrics with George of the Jungle meets Pulp Fiction for a beat was a good idea"
5,Really a great selection!,"I love this remake of a Statler Bros. song! It will go HIGH on the charts as a debut for the handsome Eric Heatherly. We will certainly hear more from him, great selection!"
4,Works great but very loud,"It's small but sturdy and works well chopping, grinding and pureeing. The only draw back would be that it's extremely loud for such a small appliance."
2,Not A Satisfied Customer,"Nice product that worked as adverstiser for several uses but eventually burned out and was in the garbage within four months. I only used this processor for small jobs that should have been ""easy"".Add this reviewer to list of reviewers who feel Cuisinart items seem prone to breakage after the warranty period has inspired.My full size processor is getting old too, so I think I'll just bite the buller and a nice full size KitchenAid processor and be done with it. I will avoid Cuisinart processors in the future."
2,Get your EAR PLUGS ready for this hunk of junk,"OK, so what do you expect for $10? Well, a unit that does not MAKE YOU DEAF when you use it. The decibels this thing puts out are totally OFFENSIVE to my ears, I cannot believe that a product that sounds like this would be sold by any company. I called Cusinart and let them hear my unit - they then let me hear one they had over there - the both sounded the same, very loud and obnoxious. My ears are still ringing almost 5 minutes after doing the demo for them on the phone. So now unless I want to spend $7 to ship it back to Amazon to get my $10 back, I just take the loss. :-( I don't think I will consider Cusinart products again in the future."
4,"Good series, a bit of a let down towards the end.","This was a good series. Good story, and good writing. However, I was a little let down at the end, not because of the writing, because of the story. It was confusing due to being rushed. Other than that, I liked it."
2,"Far from Santoshi's best work, redeemed only by music","When the movie first came out, it was heralded as Santoshi's best movie since Andaz Apna Apna. Can't be further from the truth. The flick is amateurishly directed and has very weak gags, nearly all of which I've seen before in other movies. The story is stale and there's nothing novel about the treatment either.It succeeded only because of the popularity of the lead actors and it was their first pairing together. (Yes, such trivial reasons do help a film at the Indian box office.)The soundtrack by Pritam though, is brilliant and features numerous great tracks. If you want to dish out a few bucks on this film, I'd suggest buying the songs instead."
5,Great Service - Great Product,I ordered this for my mother who couldn't find the color anywhere locally. The package came quickly with my complete order intact and exactly as ordered. I couldn't have asked for more.
2,smaller then stock battery,"i have two ,have given them over a month .i read the review that the guy sent one back .not sure that is the problem .they are definetly less out put and not much lighter .they do not last as long on a charge.had two stock batteries rebuilt and they are better. but they are less expensive then new."
2,Ostentatious,"This is without doubt a fine pen, well designed and made. However, it is also clearly designed in a attempt to impress those who are impressed by expensive showy things. Pretentious, in a word, conspicuous in another, and altogether revolting in the view of this effete aesthete. I am embarrassed to have given it as a gift to a woman of taste. I'd recommend it to oil magnates and mafia dons but I don't know anyone of that sort. Gravely disappointed.ctive 1. characterized by or given to pretentious or conspicuous show in an attempt to impress others: an ostentatious dresser"
1,The missing pages,"I love Aurelio Zen. I love Michael Dibdin. What I didn't love about this book is that it was missing forty pages (a binding error) I returned it, and got another book and....it too was missing the same forty pages!!! Amazon's customer service is so automated it is the epitomy of frustration when the problem is not covered in their program. I never bothered to apply for a refund. Couldn't stand the aggravation. I hope the book was as good as the others. The first fifty pages or so certainly were."
3,Indistinguishable buffoons,"This was not my favorite Aurelio Zen. The characters were so broadly drawn - including Zen - that I could hardly keep straight who was who. In the end it all got wrapped up, but it took a long time getting there."
3,Crime writing's most neurotic policeman,"Aurelio Zen is not your stereotypical policeman. He is extremely self absorbed and his methods of investigation are highly unusual. With each outing in Michael Dibdin's excellent series he gets more peculiar. In Back to Bologna he has become a total hypochondriac and is verging on paranoia to the extent that most of the events of the increasingly complicated chain of criminal events pass him by completely. This allows Dibdin free rein for his own surrealistic satire on all things Italian. His biting send up of national obsessions including food, football and celebrity gives an interesting insight into contemporary Italy. All in all an unusual package and not for you if you like your policemen to focus on solving crime and catching crooks."
4,Comedy with occasional outbursts of mystery,"Even if you actually read and (even less likely) loved ""Name of the Rose,"" you'll still enjoy Dibdin's farcical sendup of Umberto Eco in the latest adventure of Vice Questore Aurelio Zen, whose love life is in the dumpster as usual. The operatic plot--the collision of a egotistical television cooking star, a soccer team, an academician of semiotics, a romantic young couple direct from ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" and a witless private investigator in love with the American PIs of the 40s, with the more than usually self-destructive Zen and his soon-to-be former girl friend--is breathtaking. No one captures the dark side of Italy with more gusto and humor than Michael Dibdin.Mr. Dibdin's recent passing is a real sorrow to those who love his writing--I'm hoping that there might be a novel or two more yet to come."
2,"A farce, but not much of a ""mystery.""","This is a fun read, but hardly what I expected in a mystery. Perhaps Dibdin is trying hardest to make a philosophical statement, about life or life in Italy or whatever.Why a farce? As in: light dramatic composition marked by broadly satirical comedy and improbable plot.What about the characters? ""Grotesque"" comes to my mind: distorting the natural into absurdity, ugliness or caricature. The author conveys no empathy for his characters, so why should I, the reader, care?So if you like satire, with a twist of nihilism, this can be a fun book - ironic twists, improbable coincidences, etc. I prefer real people, and will look for another Donna Leon mystery, also set in Italy."
2,Difficult reading and major disappointment compared to other Zen mysteries!,"I previously read RATKING, DEAD LAGOON, A LONG FINISH, and END GAMES by Dibdin, and can say I rate each at least 4 stars -- good reading. But it took me until half-way through BACK TO BOLOGNA and constant referral to previous chapters to figure out what seemed to be happening. I like a complex, imperfect character in a complex story. But I was sorely disappointed by BOLOGNA. Zen is absurdly hypochondriac in recovering from a prior injury, and, unlike the other books mentioned, his intelligence and insight have nothing to do with resolution of this smoking-gun mystery. He merely observes its accidental resolution. And, as interesting as the thought might appear in the abstract, the concept of seemingly un-related but ultimately intersecting stories unfortunately falls flat in this book. I recommended this book to my bookclub before reading it: big mistake!!"
2,bad and irrelevant to the series,"Many characters, many plots but not a single thread to the core Zen character -career, friends or couple- is in the book, suddenly just finishes and then bye- bye, you need to guess the rest. Disappointing really."
5,great kick-a** viking metal,"between death and black, there is viking metal. mithotyn, amon amarth, god dethroned, gates of ishtar, defleshed, and prophanity ought to be on the same ship because they all craft one thing and that one thing is great kick-a** viking metal. mithotyn, the band getting this review, crafts 5- star music. it's like a just-right glass of lemon- ade which you are probably going to drink while listening to this fine band. long live the vikings and long live mithotyn."
4,Ax-cellent!,"Mithotyn was a great band who excelled in producing some high quality, fast Viking metal that one could imagine themselves listening to while plundering a faraway village in some Norse land. the musicianship is excellent and full of tasty double guitar work and creative bass and drumwork. the melodic aspect of the band's music comes shining through with some very very catchy hooks, but things never get too sugary sweet thanks to the blackened vocals. a few of the songs begin to blend into each other after repeated listens and i always seem to notice the same thumping bassline used in many of these songs. but when Mithotyn is at their peak, they sound truly unstoppable!!!...well...(ahem)...until they broke up and formed Falconer. but, oh well...King Of The Distant Forest is a very cool album."
2,good vocals an afterthought?,"this is another band that is like many others. they make a good noise, but the lead screamer either doesn't know how to sing or is screaming, grunting, and goaning like that on purpose. those of you that like this kind of screaming will enjoy this album. the music is pretty good. but i need vocals. buy if you like noise."
3,Disapointed,I first watched the state when I was 12 years old and loveeeeed the show and still do. I have been waiting for years for this to come to DVD (and Daria which is soon) I was so disapointed to see that they did not have the music that was originally aired on the show on the DVD. I found myself watching the episodes knowing what music should come( Barry and Levone Sexual Healing and so on) I really don't think it is the same watching it after all these years. I think I am better off watching all the seasons I recorded when they first came out on VHS. At least they are original.
2,Not as funny as when I was 13,"I remember a few skits from this from watching late night MTV as a pre-teen. I remember thinking it was hilarious. After dropping about $50 on it, not so sure it was worth it."
2,Original music would have made this wonderful.,"I suppose I understand if MTV couldn't have acquired the rights to put the original music on the DVDs, but it seems to me that they took out almost 100% of it to save money!!! All the skits I fell in love with when they first aired now just piss me off to watch.I don't know who to blame, MTV or the stupid music labels who said NO to The STATE DVD. You're telling me that Marvin Gaye is still under copyright? He died in 84!This very same thing happened to ""In Living Color"" and now all the hilarious music video skits are gone. There should be a copywright law stating that if a show is legally aired originally, that it should be allowed to be put to DVD in it's original form.I would have given it less stars if it wasn't for the brilliant comedic talent of The STATE crew.Either way, Youtube is still the best place to see The STATE.Very disappointed"
3,"The one missing ""episode""","We can only hope that eventually they'll release ""The State's 43rd Annual All-Star Halloween Special"" on DVD also. This special wasn't on MTV so who knows who owns the rights...but if the set sells well, maybe there's a prayer of a chance!Hey, if anyone puts together the correct soundtrack and sells it bootleg, please message me!"
4,The wait is over!,"The State is, without a doubt, my favorite sketch comedy show of all time. I've been waiting a looooong time for this DVD set, and it was worth the wait. They put together a really nice collection. In addition to every episode aired on MTV (the one episode aired on CBS is not included), it has some excellent commentary, interviews, and extras.I really wish I could give this 5 stars, but I have to knock a star off for the music changes. This only affects a handful of sketches, and if you never saw the original you probably won't care. But ""$240 Worth of Pudding"" just isn't the same without ""Sexual Healing"" in the background.If you watched this show in the 90's, you already know it's hilarious. Otherwise, I recommend this DVD set to anyone who likes sketch comedy shows like Mr. Show, or Kids in the Hall. And if you're a fan of shows like Reno 911 or Stella, this is where those guys got their start, so you may want to check it out."
3,Fun for all,"In a line with many Hollywood-produced serials of a comedy genre this set of episodes parades teens' sexism and sarcasm while embedding the issues of the US of the Clinton epoch.Some segments are more, some less attractive but leaving an impression of something very much artificial happened."
5,Finally,I've been waiting for the State to come out to video/DVD since it went off the air in 1996. It brought back so many memories and it seems to have held up over the years for the most part. I highly recommend!
3,The sad STATE of affairs,"I miss the days when TV shows could use music, when the Beastie Boys created an album with 100s of samples for free.The State is awesome. Not having the music, which was an integral part, not awesome. But I'm glad that it's finally available.Lack of original music is less jarring than I expected. But still, sorely missed. Commentaries up the wahzoo. Tons of extras. It's funny, David Wain mentions that it's 2007 when they taped their commentary. So, they were ready, but it took 2 more years to get the DVDs released.The DVDs were delivered in amazon's new cardboard envelope. No big deal. Arrived super fast like always."
5,Seriously you don't own this?,"Quite frankly, one of the best things to come out of the 90's. Some of the best sketch comedy that I can't believe you're reading this post and havent already hit buy now."
3,May want this one,Kids liked it. Several short stories. Quality is okay. A good way to entertain 3 or 4 year old kids.
1,NOT HALLOWEEN,This movie is not a halloween movie. There are not even any Halloween episodes on it. It turned out to be episodes that were available free through other services. I was very disappointed and feel that the title and cover of this selection are misleading.
1,If you like coffee table books - this one's not for you,"It certainly looks like a coffee table book but on closer inspection, the photography is mediocre and frequently either bears little relation to the text or flat out contradicts it. The book also suffers from factual inaccuracy, not surprising when the reader discovers it's written by someone from a totally different Buddhist tradition. If you want a good book on Zen try The Three Pillars of Zen by Phillip Kapleau, also available from Amazon. As for this one - leave well alone."
2,Notes don't simplify the book,This is the first Cliffs Notes product that I've seen that doesn't actually simplify or summarize the book. I thought that was the purpose of Cliffs Notes!
4,"Nice, inexpensive and appropriate","The book, written by an elderly lady, is quite to the point and gives very practical advices. The photographs are not too glossy but give a good inpression what roof gardening is all about."
1,Small book with small pictures and uninspiring,"This book is overall small and black and white except for a few pages in the center. However, the pictures on those pages are so small that I found them worthless for inspiration. I've picked up magazines at my local grocery store with more ideas. Don't waste your money."
3,Campy. A lot of fun.,This book is really campy and fun. Unrealistic but just go with it and enjoy it. It is kind of steampunk.
1,JEFF BRIDGES - JB - STANDS FOR JUST BIN IT,"I am huge fan of Michael McDonald and how he ever got mixed up in this rubbish is beyond me. I know both Jeff and Michael are on the same label (Ramp) but this effort is just inexcuseable!. Mr Brdiges cannot sing it seems as though he is talking fast to make his voice sound like he has rhytmn. Every song has the same beat and there is no variance what so ever. Be warned fans of Michael McDonald you will not play this a second time, I strongly suggest hunting down a copy of the Amy Holland CD - On Your Every Word to hear Michael at his best in a supporting role. To those fans of Jeff Bridges I have offended please forgive me as I only bought because of M McDonald. Thank God for Blue Obsession."
1,jeff bridges keep your day job!,This makes William Shatner sound like Frank Sinatra! What was he thinking? How come all actors want to sing and all singers want to act? If god wanted Jeff Bridges to sing he would have given him a voice. A terrific actor who hopefully will not abandon his true gift. This cd would be great to play at a party if you wanted to clear the room.
1,Be Here Soon,"Worse than listening to this CD is to have to endure Jeff live. Michael, how could you? Please take this from an MM fanatic, who will go anywhere to see you. But jeez, how could anyone mistake JB for a recording artist. You're more likely to mistake OJ for a diplomat. Michael, keep churning out your wonderful stuff; and let Jeff go back to what he does so well...."
1,From Noel Coward to Bob Dorough in two tracks?,"That exemplifies one who does not really know their niche, or is simply trying too hard. Besides, hearing this lady sing ""Devil May Care"" is a bit like expecting Bernadette Peters to a good job of covering ""I Walk on Gilded Splinters"" or, for perhaps a more wider-known song, ""Born to Be Wild."" Bottom line, the fact that she chose to name this entire release after Bob Dorough's song is a crime. Go with the original, it will serve you far better.This simply represents all that is wrong with modern ""jazz."" Avoid at all costs unless you plan on resting this right next to your Kenny G. If that's the case, I'm sure this is just your cup of tea."
3,Fairly good tripod,I have had the U8000 Slik tripod for many years. I have not used it very often but it seems to be really good for stability and adaptability to uneven terrain.It will accommodate an 80-200 zoom. A couple things I do not like: The crank handle broke off when I was turning it when it hit the end before I stopped applying pressure. I can still use this without the crank by simply lifting the shaft by hand and setting the lock ring at the appropriate height.The other thing I do not like is the quick release shoe. It has to be taken off and screwed onto the camera. If you have a second camera you must have one attached to it or you have to unscrew the one and put it on the other camera. The quick release is fine if you don't mind having it attached to your camera and you want to remove your camera from the tripod quickly.
3,It's OK,"In a nutshell, I felt like this story was a little predictable. I figured out early on who the bad guy was. I continued to read it though, hoping that I would be surprised in the end. Sadly, I wasn't."
4,Well-writtten mystery that kept me guessing,"There were a lot of elements that I really loved about this book: retired investigator who still has a great marriage, absence of obscenities, a nice assortment of characters (but not so many that I had a hard time keeping track) all with their own issues, both good and bad. Nice twists throughout the story, but nothing implausible. My real beef was with the portrayal of the local police force, as I can't imagine they wouldn't have re-opened their investigation as they learned of the missing blueprints & the other death in AL. I could have done with a few less descriptions of their food and Jill's therapy, but overall it really was a wonderful book and I will definitely read more from this series."
4,Mute says a lot...,"Mute, an instrumental comp captures the listener with swirling melodic dreamscapes, quirky pop, funky grooves and low fi moods. All set in blocks, you are taken easily to new sound experiences. Mute generates a curiosity about the various artists featured. A great example of talent in Portland. No run of the mill comp, with 70 some odd minutes of music it's a steal and there is no loss of interest. Check out the wacky packaging!"
1,Not Belt Buckle Pictured,I would not order this because what you see is not what you get. It looks nothing like the Buckle pictured.
3,Subpar Camera Work Really Holds This Back,"The Enid A. Haupt Conservatory makes for a great setting in which to exhibit Chihuly's stunning works of art. Unfortunately, the amateurish cinematography prevents this feature from being really special. It is apparent that no high-end trolleys, booms or steady-cams were utilized. Many of the shots look like they were done on foot. The panning and zooming is erratic, inconsistent, and sometimes downright herky-jerky. The music is basic atmospheric new age and serves its purpose. Altogether, it's not a bad presentation, but it really doesn't do Chihuly's works justice."
2,There is a reason why this DVD is cheap!,"There is no doubt that the art represented here is beautiful. However, this does not excuse the fact that there is not a single word spoken throughout nor are there any captions explaining where these scenes were shot. There are no credits at the end and the disk replays from the begining in a continous loop. Basically what you are buying is more like a store demo disk. What this should be at the very least is a short documentary. The box does not even include a little insert or brochure that may be a assistance. If, as the other reviewer is saying, it was 'like being there"" at least I would know where I was."
4,I'm College Bound!,"I thought this is one sexy dvd. If this is what sprink break is really like, I'm college bound! If you like hot beefy guys, you'll love this one."
2,...a cutted soft-porn version!,"The guys are beefy and hot - no college students! so, it`s for me inscrutable why they call this movie ""Spring Break Fantasy""?!?!?! But that `s not the point.This movie is a cut version of a porn movie. You really won`t see anything interessting... they cut it out. Even the screen ist sometimes fuzzy. Bad quality!So, don`t buy it, it`s not worth to spend money on this dvd!You will be gutted, if you expect any hot action!The two stars are for the hot guys! ;o)"
2,reflections - a spring break fantasy,should have listen to other reviewers. i have seen part of the origional adult film and thought they couldn't cut it to bad ( WRONG ).
4,"STRONG TORQUE, SO HOLD ON TIGHT!","GREAT SIZED MACHINE AND RUNS GOOD AS NEW. VENDOR WAS VERY TIMELY, EVEN AROUND THE HOLIDAYS. THIS LITTLE MACHINE PUSHES A LOT OF TORQUE - GOOD FOR MEATS, HARD NUTS, BREAD CRUMBS. THE BLADE SPINS CW FOR GRINDING WHICH IS THE DIRECTION THAT UNLOCKS THE BOWL FROM THE BASE, SO YOU'VE GOT TO HOLD ONTO THE COVER OR HANDLE BEFORE YOU START THE MOTOR."
5,Are we a nation of 6 year olds? Answer: Yes,"I knew David Cross from some parts in movies and of course in the best sitcom of the last 5 years: Arrested Development. I never knew he was a standup comedian until I checked his bio one time. And I was very surprised, he is really funny even though I didnt think he would be. In that way he looks a little like Steve Martin, who used to be a great comedian in the 70's.He really knows how to work with words and like any good comedian shows everyday stuff in a new light. Electric Scissors, Paris Hilton, Restaurants, Meatbulbs and 9-11.The political bits against rightwing conservatism are the best. His remark about freedom is great and could be used in a political speech. If the terrorist really hated freedom, The Netherlands would be dust...The titles of the tracks on the CD are misleading (as it the title of the album). Very long titles of nonsense but very funny.This album is great and guarenteed to make you laugh and look at things differently."
1,"Ners, This Isn't Really That Funny","Cause it hella isn't. I listened to it, and it's just this bald fool just jibbin' for hella days and not even doin anything. I mean, from the looks of things - he probably coulda busted out a jet pack or two, wouldn't ya say? Huh? Yeah. That's right. All those things are true statements.THEY SOME TRUE STATEMENTS!Anyway, let me break it down for you.HUMOR: Delightful, yet less interactive than National Archives 7.SPEED: The majority of sensitive beings (Arnold Gershwin, Todd Hellinger, Pablo Kezzarro (M.D.), Andrew Lucktrain) are nowhere near where David Cross is in speed.MAJORITY OPINION: 4/4. A SLAM DUNK!Good night. I am over the age of 13, just so you be knowin'. (You can just be like - FOOL... I ALREADY BE KNIZOWIN'!)Remember kids - concentrate."
5,david cross is not afraid,Excellent and funny. He is right on with the New Metal rip. Read the moronic one star review by some Sunday school teacher...I thought it was a joke. This sarcastic title is truly funny!
4,David on Pop Culture,"More hi-larious material from David Cross. Rather than retread over his highly political material from his last offering, David Cross offers a very dark take on Popular Culture. He does bits on ""The Simple Life"" and how terrible television shows like that make Americans look (""This is what we've done with our freedom?""), and of course, he continues with his hatred for Creed and other worthless popular music. This album, while certainly shorter than his previous two-disc set, still runs well over an hour and contains plenty of political and religious-bashing material for fans fond of those bits on his previous album. This time around, though, David Cross is more focused on what is wrong with today's entertainment and media. Very funny and timely."
2,I've HAD IT,"Harrison Greely III wrote: ""I have not heard this CD, but I read the reviews and I am offended. I was born and then raised. During that period I was taught. Within that time I forgot a lot, but I remember that if someone disagrees with me then they are wrong. I believe in things that are true.....isn't that what beliefs are anyway? Someone once told me that beliefs are personal opinions, but I told him thats what he thought.""Charles McHutchence wrote: ""Harrison Greely III CLAIMS to have read the reviews, but what is he REALLY reading?paid for by Charles McHutchence""Both of you are acting like children. The reviews are getting out of hand. You should stop it like I stopped this CD in my car and threw it at the demon driver in the lane nearest thou. Grow up! I've heard funnier sounds on the can. Stop with the pleasantries and don't make me destroy you both. I vote for an intervention.paid for by Citizens supporting Reverend Anders against Greely III - McHutchence. (CRAAG'M)"
1,"""It's Punkinninny!""","Yeah I bought this CD but you know what there's only one thing I can blame, and thats the money itself. I didn't know how to spend this money. It didn't come with instructions or a manual. I didn't realize that if you exchanged it for property or services, that they kept it for good. Just let me say this alright. This money is gone. I'm from Hollywood, I make millions of dollars pretending to be other people, but nobody was pretending when they took this money from me."" W0000000000ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"
1,Not Funny,"I don't own this and don't intend to buy it. David Cross is not funny, in any sense of the word. In fact, I'd rate this and David Cross negative stars to the power of 10 a million times over if amazon.com would allow me. David Cross is so NOT funny...Paulie Shore is funnier than David Cross. David Cross isn't even amusing. He's stupid, annoying, untalented and doesn't have a single humorous bone in his scrawny body. He clearly has worked over someone in the business to get gigs. I don't know who the guy is, but he must have a lot of pull. Because this guy...he's just not funny...at all. David Cross = EPIC FAIL."
3,"Ummm...it's called sarcasm, mayostard","Listen to the album, mayostard. The great progressive state of Mississippi is a reference to one of the bits.The album isn't for everybody. But if you enjoy angry rants that make you laugh in spite of yourself, then it's for you.I like David Cross' work on Mr. Show a lot, but I think it's because the show is scripted. Cross' standup delivery isn't terribly polished, which might work in a live show (I haven't seen him live, so I don't know), but on CD, it comes across as halting.But when he hits his stride (for example, a bit detailing the journey of gold dust from the mines of Uzbekistan to the top of his mountain of chocolate), he recalls the best rants of Carlin & Lenny Bruce."
5,Just because you like comedy doesn't mean you're good at it.,"OK, of course this album is great but when the hell did peopledecide that due to the fact that they like comedy that they should attempt it in a review on Amazon? Virtually none of these reviews are even worth a smirk and really you all should leave it to the people who are good at it.To give you a comparison - just because you happen to listen toThe Who doesn't mean you should attempt to do the guitar windmill like Pete Townshend. Enjoy it, but don't try to emulate it. You just end up looking like the drunk goofball at the show that's air guitaring.On a side note, if you like facts, humor and sense in your outlook on life then this album is a great addition to what you already feel."
2,The title says it all,"There are a few funny moments on this CD, but not enough to get me to ever buy another CD. Cross is funnier when he's part of a larger effort, such as his numerous movie roles. This CD offers nothing new, and much of the material is extremely dated."
5,Instant Nostalgia,Remember when you first started reading comics? Remember when the X-men weren't completely worn out and tired? Remember when the 80s seemed fresh and new?Even if you don't - you will after reading this coming of age supers origin story. This book is a testament to the power and quality of the indie press.
4,Good Read from an Indie Author,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. A new twist on the classic superhero story it raises some interesting questions about power.[...] The author does a good job of describing the setting and the characters a very well fleshed out.
5,Brave Men Run/ Great book,"This book is just wonderful. I got in podcast form and is read by the author. I have listened to it three times now and I just downloaded it a few days ago. This is the cream of the crop in ""free media"". He does a great job and has said that he is pleased with the communities response. He has also confirmed that there will be future installments in the Sovereign Era series."
5,Great Story lots of Fun!,"I really enjoy this Book, Its a Super hero comming of age story that takes place in the '80s. I have listen to the podio fomat at least four times and plan on reading it many more times than that. I am quite happy to finaly have a ""hard copy"" of this great story!"
1,Where's the Beef?,I agree with all the other reviewers who complain that this book is big on generalizations and has almost nothing to say on how to actually identify and follow a trend. I've rarely read a trading book with so little practical information or one that repeated generalizations so many times.
2,Vastly Overrated,"If you have any interest in learning how to use a trend following methodology - or even how trend following really works - you should look elsewhere. Nothing in this book is applicable beyond a brief chart in the last third that explains support and resistance. While I do not agree with the position that trend following is dead, overrated, or otherwise worth ignoring, this book most assuredly is worth ignoring. What little it offers in practical advice can be found in many better, less expensive books on basic technical trading."
2,Trend Hype,"I read this book and I must say that I liked it but it really was just a bunch of hype as to why you should be a trend follower. Everyone in the trading business knows that the trend is your friend. Most have heard of the Turtles and know that trend following can be a great way to make money trading. But what this book doesn't address is how to trend follow. It talks alot about the money managers that do trend follow, but nothing about how, which the title of the book implies. It says ""How"" but fails to address ""How"" other then to say these guys are trend followers and you should be too. I would say the title is a little misleading. The title should be , ""These Great Traders Make Money by Trend Following"". So if you want to learn the ""how to"" then just forget this book as it will give little insight into that."
3,"Readable, but far from helpful","About four years ago I read the original edition of it, wrote a review with a five star rating on Amazon which Amazon had never published for a reason I never know. Neverthless, I put it on my Listmania List for Traders for years. Today, after I finished the expanded edition, I removed it from my Listmania List. I admit that my expectation had been raised. I am not satisfied with histories/philosophies/tactics of highly successful trend followers. I already buy into the Trend Following Strategy so the tons of arguments from the author against ""Buy and Hold"" become meaningless to me. I want to look more into each, for something that I can readily copy and profit. In short, still a good (but over stretched) introduction to trend following. Readable with plenty of quotes from great traders, but definitely not on any aspiring trend followers/traders top priority list."
5,The book that changed me (as a trader),"I think the title says it all. This is a great book not because of any single sentence or in some great secret formula explained within. Instead it's a great book because after reading it, and absorbing it all, it changed me as a trader. I now ride the market long as it trends up, ride the market short while it trends down, and quietly sit on the sidelines if the market is not trending.There are some sample programs as an appendix that have actual how-to info on developing mechanical trading systems based on these ideas. I found them to be invaluable in understanding and as further insight into perhaps how the highly successful trend traders profiled in the book actually trade.If you are willing to leave the 95% of unsuccessful retail traders who sadly spend all of their energy trying to predict the market, and instead want to become part of the 5% that consistently beat the market then perhaps this book is for you. Happy trading."
1,Waste of Money,"I have read many trading/investing books and this one is a total waste of time and money. Mr. Covel seems most interested in dropping names and showing you lots of graphs and charts from the trend traders he has interviewed, without disclosing anything of value on the parameters for entering and exiting trades."
2,data mining and overly verbose,"This book was filled with anecdotal reports of traders can have done better than buy and hold through trend following, but the results seemed to be a case of data mining to me. The benefits over buy and hold in the examples were small, but individual years' returns departed so much from the market that these trading methods would be psychologically very difficult to stick with. Finally, there was no comparison of trend following to a broadly diversified and regularly rebalanced portfolio, which should be superior to straight buy-and-hold on a risk-adjusted basis.The actual ""how"" to implement trend following was roughly only 30 pages worth of the appendix."
2,Citations and Quotes Anyone?,"I cant believe this book is over 400 pages!! the most interesting part of this book has only been the actual trend followers in the beginning chapters and their gains over time that they have earned, Though it does present hard core proof that trend following has lived up to one of the best ways of making money in the market long term.(opinion, not mine, but wont disregard) Other then that remove the TRILLION!!! quotes and citations of the money managers reports to investors and what they said in interviews and you'd be left with a book no more then 50 pages long! all the remaining information could have been found in any beginner stock book.I Wasted time reading over 200 pages of quotations and citations."
2,Impressed.,"I find it remarkable and I was quite impressed how someone can write 200 pages with just one message, ""there are a number of commodity trading advisers who have made lots of money by following trends"". Its an old message that the trend is your friend, but Covel has written a whole book on this one trading adage. You will not learn much else from this book, so if you are looking to improve your trading or investment skills look somewhere else."
4,Trend Following by Michael Covell,"Having studied the markets for years with a library of trading books, that has my shelves groaning I have finally read a book which lays out the stark realities of trading in the bluntest and most straight forward fashion that I have read in years. The book is refreshing in its direct and open depiction of trading and in my opinion clears away a great deal of the mystery, embellishment and blatantly false information that some books out there would have us buy into.Trend Following is clearly written, with great anecdotes and comments adding to the plainly written methods used in trend following with its associated risks and rewards. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in any form of trading or investing, regardless of whether they believe they are suited to this type of trading or not."
1,Not what you think it is,"I felt there was little information for the average trader to use. It appeared to be more of a promotion for certain money management companies. If you think that you will see examples of trend following techniques that you can use, this is not the book for you. I was disappointed! There are pages and pages of how certain gurus made money. Unfortunately, their techniques are proprietary."
1,Title is Misleading,"This book's sub-title say, ""How Great Traders Make Money in Up or Down Markets.""The content of this book falls far from delivering its promise. The cover of this book promises that it will show you how to apply trend following techniques to your trading. ""Covel walks you through the process, one step at a time, in plain English."" He certainly does no such thing.If you are looking for a trend-following system, you will not find it in this book; nor will you find any help or guidance in how to go about developing your own trend following system.As someone who trades for a living, I found nothing between the covers of this book applicable to improving real-world trading results."
1,A waste of money,"The cover of this book promises that it will show you how to apply trend following to your porfolio. ""Covel walks you through the process, one step at a time, in plain English."" This is misleading. Aside from a back test on some basic systems, there is no concrete discussion on how to trade trends in the entire book. The portraits of the major trend followers are not uninteresting, but Jack Schwager's Market Wizard series is far superior. Covel also goes to great lengths to ""prove"" that trend followers were on the winning side of all the major crises and meltdowns of the last decade (e.g. LTCM), but the only proof he offers is that a number of trend followers had gains in the months where others were losing. Much of the book is packed with statistical data on performance that might be of interest to someone writing a thesis on the subject. If that's who you are, buy the book, but don't expect much nuts and bolts information on making money in the market."
3,So Far So Good,"This book is not as good as I expected. It talks much about the trading records and philsophy of the great trend following winners. However, only few pages out of the 400+ pages are about how to build trading system. It seems that the author is trying to ask the readers to attend his trading courses. This is skeptical to me because I do not learn anything how to trade in practice after reading this book."
2,Acceptable Review of Trend Following,"An interesting perspective on trading. Readers are told to hire a trend following manager or to learn from the masters outlined in the book. And if you read and fully absorb the timeless wisdom of the pages of the book the vital truths are all there.There is little by way of trading tips in this book so you will have to do plenty of hard work and probably read some other books or take come courses if you are to gain from Michael's messages. As a real trader, what I would have liked to see was more steak."
2,Excelent book title,"...It's an excellent book that can be summed up by it's title.If you are a trader, you can buy the book, but in the end you realize that if you just look at the front cover and trade with the trend you will do fine without reading the rest of the pages. The book contains intellectual discourse that is quite satisfying but add little to help your actual trading. The title is it.If you are *not* a trader, and want to read an intellectual discussion on how great traders trade in general, then this is a good book to read."
2,"Trend Following: How Great Traders Make Millions in Up or Down Markets, New Expanded Edition, (Paperback)","Disappointing. Long on theory and very short on practical advice. Not of much use to an individual investor. I would not recommend this book to someone looking for a ""how to"" book."
2,The Title say it all.,"If your looking for information and possible techinques to add to your search for trends. Don't bother. This is a book about people who do. Interesting but not what I was looking for, I saw the bold Title and fell for it. It's also pretty dry stuff, I've read better bio's in Barrons."
4,Entertaining,"Although some of the acting was not as strong as in 'Anne of Green Gables', the two short films presented on the videocassette were charming, and ultimately worth seeing. If you enjoy the Anne series and want more of Avonlea, you will appreciate these films. Not just for children--adults will like them, too."
1,Alternative with Applesque design,"If you are upgrading from a one button Apple Wireless Mouse or you own an Apple laptop and want to be free of wires, I would recommend you also consider the the well designed BT Mouse from MacMice (www.macmice.com/themousebt.html).Someone really should resell it here on Amazon too.I am personally still hoping for someone to produce a BlueTooth trackball."
5,"""There Is No Life...In The Void...Only...Death...""","This is a terrific piece. Not only do we finally get a Sauron figure, but we get one with a real cloth cape, light-up eyes, and movie phrases. With a character so evil and a figure so cool, who could ask for anything more? I would advise every Lord Of The Rings fan to pick one up. No, pick up two!!"
5,Sauron,"Sauron is by far the coolest figure from the Lord of the Rings films. Although he did not take physical form in the books, the artistry of Sauron's character in the movie and toy is phenomenal. It has extremely fine detail and it is a very accurate replica of the character in the movie. At 10"", it is an excellecnt sized collectible toy. His fingers are detachable to simulate the scene in the movie where Isildur sliced them off. The fingers fit securely unless the figure falls. They came off when he fell a fell times but I got a figure-display stand. So now his fingers no longer come off since he held is securely in place."
5,Sauron lives!,"This is a great figure of Sauron. I says four phrases, and he says them loudly. His eyes light up red when he talks. You can take his fingers off. His ring is small and I can see where it would get lost easily, but you get a package of ""spare"" rings. I had four rings in that pack. He looks fantastic. He has great armor and is very sturdy."
5,LOTR rules!!!!,"This 12"" Sauron is one of the best toys i have seen so far. (...). He is movable and has light up eyes and he speaks phrases from the movie which is pretty awesome. Some of the things he says are ""build me an army worthy of Mordor"" ""there is no life in the void"" and ""i see you"""
4,Review of Mist Over the Mountains,"I really enjoyed this book and it was an easy read. I would highly recommend it to people who enjoy Southern Literature of the United States. It is one of the most refreshing books in its genre and comes highly recommended by Booklist, Kirkus REview and the New York Times Book Review List.Four stars!"
5,Great watch,"I wasn't familiar with the Invicta brand, but my husband saw this watch online and wanted it. I ordered it for him as a surprise, tho a little worried that it wouldn't be as nice as it looked in the picture. To my own surprise, the watch is very nice. It's big and has a good weight to it that my husband really likes. Excellent buy for $90."
2,This is Junk,The hobby knife you are looking at right now is not that great. If you are going to build models with this I reccomend a kit with interchangable blades.
4,pulley,these pulleys are sturdy but at reasonable price. Bought several but only 2 arrived; the rest were lost or missing in transition. I have been waiting for 2 months now to get the rest replaced or shipped in from the vendor.
4,Made truck shift like new.,I added this after fixing a leak so my issue may have been from that as-well but the truck shifts better than it did in a long time.
5,Outstanding product,My 2001 Buick LeSabre was experiencing transmission shudder and a tube of this did the trick. While I know a rebuild will be in the future I want to buy as much time as I could. Great stuff. Does what it says it'll do.
5,It works,"This is a great product that eliminates torque converter shudder, which feels as if your transmission is slipping. Many Ford products have this problem Dr. Tranny fixes it. Don't know how, but it does."
2,Didn't work.,"This product seemed to make no difference at all in my 1995 Saturn automatic transmission. I used one tube, and after not experiencing any improvement, used another tube several weeks later. No joy.I didn't expect miracles, mind you. It's only an additive. But I had hoped for at least some improvement. Still, it's cheap enough that I guess it was worth a try."
4,Great English book,"This is a pretty great English 1010 or High School AP English book. It has a lot of diversity without too much dribble. It gives students exposure to some pretty great literature that they wouldn't ordinarily find their way to, as well as some more common knowns."
5,An Awesome Book!,"Mandie is visiting Jonathan in New York, and the 'mansion' that he lives in awes her. But there is never a dull moment. Jonathan finds a dog, and then a strange girl comes looking for it. And when they find the butler tied up, Mandie is sure something sinister is in the air.While chasing the person they believe to have tied up the butler, Mandie and Jonathan get stuck on a rooftop with no way of getting down.But when they finally do get down, they made a surprising discovery.I really liked this book. The part about Jonathan and Mandie stuck on the roof of an apartment is really page turning.Angelina sounds like someone's little sister. She sounds sooooo cute! If you've read this book and want to hear more about all the characters in New York again, read 'Mandie and the New York Secret.' Everyone is back in it, and it is a really good book."
5,Everybody loves Zits,"This is the 3rd Zits treasury. It contains comic strips from the books ""Unzipped"" and ""Busted."" Unlike the individual Zits comic books, the treasuries feature all Sunday comics in color. ""Supersized Zits"" begins with a full-color version of ""Good Night Dude,"" a parody of ""Goodnight Moon"" that was not printed in ""Unzipped"" or ""Busted.""Zits is a classic for anyone who has ever had close contact with teenagers, because its humor rings true! It makes me laugh, (I'm in my 20s and have many teenage siblings); and it makes my 70-year-old grandpa laugh (a father and retired teacher). Scott and Borgman's fodder is the hilarity found in the so-called mundane and ordinary world of tennagers and parenthood."
4,remixes and bonus trax,The standard US edition of this EP has:1) Mixed Bizness2) Mixed Bizness (Nu Wave Dreamix by Les Rythmes Digitales)3) Mixed Bizness (Cornelius remix)4) Mixed Bizness (DJ Me DJ You)5) Dirty Dirty6) Saxx Laws (Night Flight to Ojai)
3,remixed bizness & reshuffling,"the edition I got of this single was a little bit different, it had the 1st 2 tracks of this 1 then another mix subtitled 'dirty Bixin Mixness' which was a pretty good version, & I was disappointed by the Les Rhythms Digitales mix, very cheesy, boring & embarrassing, like the Motiv8 ones on those Pulp singles that were rather useless. What it also had was a track called Arabian Nights which had more raps similar to the ones on Hlwd. Freakz off Vultures or even Little Drum Machine Boy, occasionally sounding interesting but not overly. Mixed Business itself is a fine funky tune, full of sexuality & humour & studio effects galore & that other remix I mentioned took it a bit further. Basically if you already have the album this doesn't add much & isn't too essential, but if you just want the song & don't want to invest for the rest, then get this I suppose, + the other b-sides could be worth it. ""Makin' all the Lesbians scream..."""
4,Sin vs. Virtue?,"This movie is one of a kind. It centers on a town in Spain that is ""dying."" We slowly learn some of the reasons for this, and the movie shifts from black and white to color to show the coming alive of the community.This movie is stark and focuses on characters and dialogue. It shows the conflicts and oddities of human nature and asks the questions: What is sin? What is charity? Who is truly good? Is being truly good a form of vanity or pride? Fascinating stuff. I enjoy movies by Spanish filmmakers for the way they look at human nature: there's a wondrous juxtaposition of pragmatism and a romanticism that is not usually found in US films.This film points to the way we as humans live -- sometimes comfortably, sometimes with resignation -- with contradications."
3,Fog of War in Written Form,"Book was too jumpy going from scene of action in one place to a 2nd and then a 3rd. If the writer wanted to portray the confusion of battle, he did that, but made for a difficult read."
5,Best Marine Corps Combat Narrative of the War,Ambush Ally is an outstanding combat narrative! Gripping is a good word for it. I have written and studied the accounts of the Task Force Tarawa battle from the perspective of the Saddam's Naseriyah Fedayeen who carried out the defense of the route 7 highway. I don't believe it needs editing and I place it next to Thunder Run as the best historical account of the invasion. This is a keeper for Marine Corps enthusiasts or Iraq war historians.It really captures just how badly prepared the Marines were for entering Naseriyah (because of incredibly bad intelligence)and how their sheer toughness and skill broke through the Fedayeen's fanatical defenses. It gives clear meaning to why Naseriyah is going up with pride on the Battle Wall at the Iwo Jima memorial. Great Book!
2,Ambush Alley,"Part of the killing was the over kill by the author depicting the Marines as a bunch of whining, sniveling, ill trained little boys. Move the book to the fiction catagory. ... Retired Marine Sgt."
2,Disappointing,I found it hard to enjoy this book because of the arrogant pride and disrespect shown by members of the US Marine Corps towards the US Army.
2,Former Marine,"I read about the author's ""award-winning"" documentaries, but throughout the entire book I bristled every time the word Marine was NOT capitalized, as it should be. We are proud of our title, and it is always capitalized, had this ""documentarian"" done some digging, and it would not have taken much, he would have realized his mistake.Also, agree with other reviews regarding the skipping around, this makes it difficult to follow at times. Reading about a battle which was fought in the ""fog of war"" does not mean I want to read about it while the fog is still present."
3,"awesome Marines, a disappointing book","The battle of An-Nasiriyah was the most viscious of the war in Iraq until Fallujah 2. Like Fallujah, the battle for An-Nas ran for a week +, and was won by the bravery and courage of the young Marines. But while the author has interviewed many of the participants, he focuses on Day 1 of the battle, and loses his objectivity. There are also multiple conversations that have been 'ad-libbed,"" and did not take place. Does the book read well ? Yes. Is it accurate...it's 85 %. But at least it recognizes the efforts, valour, and sacrifice of the Marines that awful week //"
3,Expensive way to boil water,"I received this kettle as a gift in 1996. I was a big fan of copper cookware, so I was excited to have it.A few years ago, I noticed that the black paint on the handle was flaking off, sometimes falling into the kettle when I was filling it. At this point, about half of the paint has flaked off, and I should probably just sand it all off and seal the handle. You would think that for almost $200 the manufacturer could do better than applying black paint to the handle.Aside from the flaking paint, what I don't like ahout the actual utility of this kettle is that it is impossible to get my hand inside to clean. The handle and opening make it impossible. As a result the tin has corroded in areas and I can't get any force behind a scouring pad to remove the corrosion."
2,Bright Copper Kettle and....,Love this kettle - it is a beautiful addition to my kitchen. Does need polishing every week or so but worth the effort.
4,Packed with Useful Information,"Bicycle Magazine's Mr. Hewitt provides 636 tips (plus sub-tips and framed sections with extra tips, presumably totalling 1000) covering safety in traffic, riding positions, skill builders, training techniques, distance riding, mountain biking, racing, health and fitness, nutrition, equipment, and bike care. The tips are stated concisely and are mostly well-organized, although each chapter should have been divided into sections for greater clarity. The glossary and index are excellent. There is one demerit, however: there is a dearth of illustrations (only 9). If the book had contained more diagrams, I would have been compelled to give it a 5. Even better would be to make the book into a video or DVD course!"
3,Pretty good,"I bought this coffee maker after reading rave reviews about the taste and quality of the coffee. Well, so far the coffee has been only so-so. The main reason is that I can't determine how much coffee to use because I can't see how much water is in the maker. I used to just use a 16 oz bottled water and two heaping scoops of coffee. I find that I need more coffee with this maker to get the same strength coffee. I hate that the amount of water can only be viewed looking from the top and not through the side. Bad design. Other than that, it's o.k."
5,Best Home Brewed Coffee Ever,"Consistently best home brewed coffee ever. Have have had many coffee makers (e.g. Krups, Braun); many coffee brands. Millstone ""Bed and Breakfast"" and ""Breakfast"" are great $10.00/lb. or less ""everyday"" coffees. Model sells for up to $149.00. Amazon charged $79.00 - most ever spent for coffeemaker. Price is beyond reasonable for what you get. Very easy to operate and clean. Different functions and controls simple and intuitive. Looks great. Very efficient due to high water temp. and well designed drip function. Only small measure (comes with unit) is required for great cup of coffee."
3,"Good-tasting coffee, but dripping carafe","The coffee maker has been good overall, but I'm very disappointed that the carafe drips with just about every pour. For a model in this price range, I expected that detail to be a given."
1,Cuisinart should be charged with fraud,"Regardless of how this machine works, Cuisinart fraudulently calls it a 12 cup unit. Buried in the instructions they say that their definition of a ""cup"" is five ounces. Of course, the whole world knows that a cup of coffee is SIX OUNCES! In other words, (5oz X 12 cups) = (6oz X 10 cups). This is NOT A 12 CUP COFFEE MAKER."
4,Kitchen essentials,A very good programmable coffee maker. The only drawback is that water drips out the back of the uplifted lid. A slight engineering plunder.
5,Finally a dripless carafe,"I have used Krups, Braun, Mr. Coffee and others,but I am impressed with this coffee maker. It does not have a door to swing open, the carafe is absolutely dripless!, the controls are above the carafe and out of the way if coffee is spilled, it is easy to program, and best of all it makes a great cup of coffee. Thanks."
5,A Dream Come True!!,"I absolutely love this coffee maker! It is definitely worth the extra money to get a product of this quality. The coffee brews hot, stays hot, and doesn't leak on the counter like the Gevalia and Krups I had. I think it's easy to pour the water in the reservoir, unlike the GE I had. Also, the brew timer stays at the assigned time and doesn't have to be reset each time like GE. The lids stays tight, and I don't have any problems with dripping. It's a wonderful product and I can't say enough about it!!"
5,Top rated coffee maker,"I was researching Consumer Reports' ratings of coffee makers and found that this Cuisinart model was rated number 1!After I knew what I wanted to buy, I went online to find the best place from which to buy this gift for my Mother for Mother's Day.The best price and service was found at BensofMaine and so I ordered it from them. The customer service was excellent and I am very pleased with the experience of dealing with Amazon and its marketplace sites."
3,"Plenty of swing, but....",Jack has a strong voice but seems stuck in the lounge singer role on this CD. Many of the tracks fall short of expectations.
5,A great artist who makes old and new songs come alive,"""What colour is the wind"" is an incredibly beautiful song that every father will love."
3,Not as good as the moon,When I got this I was thinking along the lines of goodnight moon but it is not as good. My daughter doesn't like it as much either. It's ok and the pictures are cute.
3,"Cute illustrations, but lacking in text","I have two boys under age 2, and for Christmas my husband and I opted to give them mostly books. I added this one to my cart not realizing there isn't much story in this book, mostly just a picture book. Don't get me wrong, the illustrations are adorable and we can ""make up"" a story as we go along or play a game of name-the-animal. But it's not exactly what I expected or prefer. I like a children's book with cute illustrations AND a nice story."
5,Adorable Board Book,"This is one of my favorite books to give to new or expectant parents. There are few words (just the guard saying goodnight to all the animals at the zoo); it's what's going on behind his back that makes it a delightful story about a mischievous gorilla. The illustrations are wonderful. Look for the balloon in the background on all the pages. All four of my kids (now ages 10-15) adored this book when they were little. It's a keeper. Look for Officer Buckle and Gloria, another wonderful picture book by the same author. More for toddlers, but my 10-yr old still likes to read it!"
4,Sweet book for bedtime.,"It took me a while to warm up to this nearly-wordless book, but now my daughter and I both love it.If you like to talk with your little one while reading, then ""Good Night Gorilla"" is fantastic. The only words are ""good night"" and the animal names. The illustrations are the best part of the book, and they are full of details. On each page there's a little mouse carrying a banana and balloon that's floating away in the sky. It's fun to hunt for those things and to talk about the funny animals in the pictures.If you're looking for a unique book to engage your toddler, I'd recommend this one."
2,where are the words?,"I don't mind picture books and making up my own story to go along with it, but this book has minimal words....it should either have no words or have a story to go along with it. i don't like the inbetween. It would be really nice for it to have a story to go along with it. I suppose I will just make up my own story with the cute pictures, but toddlers love repetition, so i am not impressed with this purchase at all. mY son who is 2 knows words to his favorite books and i was hoping this would become his favorite, but no interest in it for now. I bought the dvd, hoping once he sees that he will enjoy the book more. Cute pictures though. wasn't what i expected based on reviews though."
3,Overall disappointed,"I bought this book because of the reviews and I love all books that have to do with going to bed to read to my 15 month old son. But this book has very little writing in it and is not appropriate for small kids. I find myself adding in words to fill in the story (""and the gorilla takes the keys and says come along elephant...etc) I love the illustrations but it isn't really what I thought it was going to be. Don't buy this for anyone under 2 1/2 in my opinion."
5,Wonderful Children's Book,"Our 3-year old grandson dearly loves this book. He has learned the names and how to pronounce the names of the different animals depicted in the story. He eagerly awaits the Good night, good night, good night pages. I find I don't grow weary of the repeated readings because he enjoys it so much."
5,A Fun and Beautiful Bedtime Book,"In this beautifully-illustrated bedtime book, the gorilla steals the key from the zookeeper, letting out all the animals, who follow the zookeeper home to bed.The story is cute, but what I really loved about this book was the great illustrations. The colors pop out at you from the page and capture your attention. Also, there are some fun things to look for in the pictures, for example there is a balloon in almost every single picture - can you find it?This book is one of my new bedtime favorites! This is one of my son's bedtime favorites, along withGoodnight MoonandThe Going-To-Bed Book."
3,Book not for infants,"The paper in the book is very thin and while the pictures are vivid, it does not stand up to infant grabbing and licking of pages. I think my little one will enjoy this book more when she gets past that stage."
5,Fun and funny,A wonderful story. Classic kids' book. They love the art work! A terrific little book for kids. A goodbook before 10 minutes tlll Bed Time. It's sturdy.
5,For every Grammy's bookshelf,Who can resist the charm of a little gorilla? This book will generate a lot of conversation between grammy and the grans! A must-have for any Grammy's bookcase or a great gift for your young Valentine!
3,over rated,"There are barely any words in this book. It's mostly pictures. I'll give you a breakdown:32 pages (23 of them have no words)47 words total (all but 4 are either ""good"", ""night"", or an animal name. The other 4 words are ""dear"" (twice), ""zoo"", and ""zzzz"".When I buy a book to READ to my son, I expect more than pictures. The pictures are nice, but from the high ratings I was expecting a lot more. It may be better for older children who can talk to their parents about the pictures (my son is 10 months). I like amazon prices, but I will be checking out books in person before ordering from now on."
5,A Charming Choice,My 2 year old grandson laughed out loud when the book was read in an animated way. Delightful for me too.
5,A Must For Your Child's Library,"Goodnight, Gorilla is a delightful book, filled with fun, secrets and anticipation. We started reading it at age 2 and my now 6 year old son still enjoys it! We especially love the dark page with eyes....you will too! It is the perfect companion to '10 Minutes Till Bedtime', also by Peggy Rathmann, because this cast of characters appear in that book as next door neighbors! Together they make a perfect child/baby gift. Thanks Peggy Rathmann!"
3,Thought it would be better,I keep seeing this book and reading how great it is but have never bought it. I checked it out of the library and thought it was just okay. There is actually limited reading in the book and parents will have to explain a lot to younger children. Not for under 2 unless you just use it for talking about animal names.
2,Not what I expected...,"This book came with some dissappointment. You will probably find the illustrations to be good, but there was not much of a story for my three year old. I found myself having to make up my own narration to the story. Older kids may be able to grasp the story from the illustration, but this is probably not for preschoolers."
3,Book,"Two of the pages were stuck together with a drop of something. That was diasappointing from a quality standpoint. Since it was a small item purchased along with another larger item, it wasn't worth returning. If it had been in a store, I would not have purchased it."
2,To each child his own taste...,"A cute concept and gentle story. However, our 25 month old guy never gets past the second page before casting it aside and going for Duck in a Truck, The Going to Bed Book, Goodnight Moon or Where's My Dog Scruff.Try as I do to make this story more engaging for him by pointing, asking him to find things, imitating animal noises, etc., it just doesn't appeal to him.Perhaps when he's older and understands the joke better..."
3,I don't know what to make of this book,"I bought this book recently for my son and although he seems to enjoy it for the animal pictures, but I am undecided whether I like it or not. The illustrations are good and you pretty much have to make up the story as you go because there are no words. This is OK by me, reading is one of my son and I's favourite things to do and books with no text can be really fun. But with this book, the story just doesn't come naturally to me to tell it. Is this because I am struggling to tell it in such a way as he will understand? He is only 2 so perhaps a little too young to tell the story in full to. I don't know. My advice for anyone thinking about buying this book is to be prepared to be able to give some thought to how you tell it, if you're talking to really young ones. I need to work out some good words for it still. Then I think we'll enjoy it more."
4,Go for the hardcover version,"I bought this in the paperback version for whatever reason and immediately wished I'd sprung for the hardcover. The book is very cute, few words so you can make up the story depending on your child's age. The pages in black with white eyes scared my 1 year old at first and I'd have to skip over those pages, but now he likes them. Definitely a book your child can grow into. The paperback is so thin though, so I'll probably end up getting this again in another format."
4,Needs more words,"I had read other reviews that indicated that there weren't a lot of words in this book, but the ""story"" seemed cute so I thought I'd try it anyway. The pictures really are very nice and the concept of the story was just as fun as I expected it would be. After looking through it though I do think it could have done with more words. I purchased it for a 1 year old so having just pictures isn't terrible, but I think the book would grow with a child more and be enjoyed for longer if it had some words and could be read rather than just looked at."
2,Sending Back!,"I am so disappointed with this book, especially after reading all the rave reviews. There is absolutely nothing to the book. The only words in it are ""good night"" and an animal name. If not for the illustrations, I would have rated one star. Absolutely not worth the price. I've seen better books at Dollar General for $1.00! Seriously"
1,For a book there isn't much writing...,"I bought this book because it was on a list of best board books for toddlers, but there is very little to the story. The illustrations are great, but as far as I am concerned turning the pages in silence is not very exciting for a wiggly 2 year old boy. Save your money and buy a book like ""I love you stinky face"" or ""goodnight moon"". Those books have great pictures and words on every page!"
1,A word of caution about this book,"I recently read this to my 2-year old, thinking it was cute. Now he's having nightmares about a black monkey that comes into his room at night, and waking up exhausted in the morning. I've tried to explain to him that dreams aren't real, but he's too young to get it and is now scared at bedtime. Those with imaginative or sensitive children might want to skip this one."
4,Cute,"This is a fun story, but be warned several pages have no words and are simply pictures. My husband loves to ""read"" it to our young toddler as he can tell a different story each night. The pictures/artwork is nice."
3,It's okay,"I know this is viewed as a classic, but I just find it okay. I got it for my 1 yr old which is probably too early for this book, so maybe she'll grow into it. Not many words, so it relies on understanding the sequence of the pictures which my daughter can't quite do yet. She likes hearing words and the story along with the pictures."
3,Perhaps better in full size,"We have this book in the board book size. I read the reviews and wonder if we are missing something because the illustrations are not all that engaging. I have four kids and none has ever been particularly interested in this book even given my attempts to engage them with the story and the pictures. Each has had his/her own favorite book and it has never been this one. I should look at a bigger one, maybe that's the ticket."
5,A Great First Book That Will Last,"This book was given to us as a gift when my daughter was born and it was the first book she seemed to truly enjoy. The tale is silly and easy to follow, and once we noticed that the balloon and the moon could be found somewhere on every page, reading the book was an interactive adventure as my daughter tried to locate the items. As a former zookeeper, I really appreciated the ""family photos"" on the wall of the zookeeper's house - all animals! Little touches like that make the book a real gem to be treasured. My daughter is now three and she still loves this book."
5,Universally Loved,"My students love this book and it is useful for so many goals, I actually purchased a second copy when I couldn't find the first this fall. Now I have two copies and my student get really, really excited when they notice there are two gorilla books.The version I have is a lap edition, board book, which is extremely sturdy and large enough to read to multiple students.This is a book with humorous elements, repetitive themes, and so many ways to creatively explore. One thing small children enjoy so much is voices. When all the animals chime in with their ""good night"", each one can have its own voice.I, too, add this to a baby shower or new baby gift. It is so versatile that it is a book that can be read to a small baby through kindergarten."
4,review of Molecular Systematics,Molecular Systematics is the best general text on population and evolutionary genetics I have read. It provides sufficient depth to give adequate understanding of molecular phylogenetics and molecular population genetics data for most purposes. The broad research behind the work makes it an excellent starting point for finding journal articles on specific subjects within this field. The only drawback to the book is that it is five years old and the field is quite fast moving. Hopefully a new edition will appear shortly.
2,What is Molecular Phylogenetics?,This book does not tell anything about sequence alignment.Except this 'little problem' it is a good book anyway.But do you think that sequence alignment is not an important issue in molecular phylogenetics?
5,Excellent information,"With a solid four pages or so of favourable reviews within the book itself, it's fair to say that this book has been well received.The difference between presenting a message and getting your message across is powerfully demonstrated within this book. Plenty of examples of presentations getting a workover and numerous lessons on how to achieve a higer level of communication with your presentations is well covered bu Weissman.If only this was given away with every copy of MS Powerpoint the world would be a much better (and less boring) place."
5,Very helpful,"This book is literally an eye opening experience to anyone who communicates to people -verbal or written -on a daily manner; which in my book is EVERYONE. Weissman shares many years of wisdom and insight through various proven corporate methods for your professional and personal life. From meeting people, formal presentations, job interviews, to construction of reports: strategic and tactical planning, budgets, etc.This is not a book for a person who wants a reader digest version -quick. It takes time to read, re-read and understand and apply his skill sets"
2,Pass on this one,"I got this book based on the other reviews I read here. There is some good information, but it could be condenced to 5 pages. It's geared towards his business, which is helping CEOs develop their pitch to venture capitalists. In this sense, and in many others, he doesn't pratice what he preaches, namely WIIFY--what's in it for you. He writes to a narrow audience though it's pitched to a general business market. Would you beleive this guy has never had a job where he had to do formal presentations himself? He was in the movie/TV business and a friend in high places, Compaq CEO, introduced him to an awesome contact in Silicon Valley. He made a business as a consultant from that contact, which led to this book. I think this hole is evident in the material."
5,"Jerry aka ""Yoda""","I had the privilege of taking Jerry's course which is what he based this book on. What a great experience. I frequently refer to this book. I frequently take it off the shelf, extract snippets and use them in response to e-mails. Far too many times my team members never get to ""Point B"", they forget about ""WIFFY"", they never tell 'em what you're going to tell them, tell them and then tell 'em what you told 'em. An excellent book and reference. If you ever get the chance to take Jerry's course - in person - cancel your vacation, business trip or day off and just DO IT! You won't regret it.p.s. Thanks Microsoft for sending me on ""Jerry"" training."
3,It seems having no typos isn't one of the deadly sins,"Its a good book, but full of typos. Excessive typos creates will a subconscious skepticism of the credibility of the author while reading. It's ironic that a book on effective presentation contains so many typos, I would say more than I can will remember from any book at from a major publisher.(The typos above were intended.)"
5,Wolves are awesome,I love wolves. This documentary was the perfect introduction tool for learning about these beautiful creatures. I would recommend this item to anyone even mildly interested in wolves.
5,wolf book that is clear and fun and full of knowedge,"A wonderful text and gathering of photos, this book is copanion to the Dutcher's film series. Appropriate for children and adults, this book will open people's eyes to the wonder and basics of wolves.Twenty-Week-Old Gray Wolves, Canis Lupus, Rest Together Artists Photographic Poster Print by Jim And Jamie Dutcher, 30x40"
5,Living With Wolves,I would have loved to be with the Duetchers in the making of this video.It was so awesome.We had a hybred wolf many years ago and she was absolutely beautiful.
4,Good Documentary,This is a well done video. I live not too far from Yellowstone and the Sawtooths. I love backpacking in these outdoor locations. The scenery was beautiful in the video and great videoagraphy.
5,Amazing!,"This video was very intruging to watch I enjoyed it very much. There was lots of facts, theories, and questions."
3,Really?,"As I read these reviews, I have to wonder if the Dutchers don't have a lot of friends posting reviews here. This is a good show, and fairly interesting, but in no way does it warrent 5 stars, especially as a documentary about wolves. It is really more a documentary on Jim Dutcher and his experiment living with wolves in captivity. It does contain some compelling footage of the filmaker interacting with the wolves, but there is nothing new here, save for a crazy guy ( I mean that in a good way) sharing a meal of raw meat with a pack of wolves. This show is worth a watch, but not, in my opinion, worth owning. If he could have acheived this living with the wolves in the wild, I'm sure I would have been supremely impressed. Unfortunately, this is a topic which is sorely lacking, as the best documentary I have ever seen on wolves (filmed in the Spanish Pyrenees) is not only not available on dvd, buy I can find no record of it."
2,disappointed,"We expected this to be a documentary about wolves but it was a actually a story about the documentors. While their story was interesting, it's not what we were looking for. Our children quickly became bored."
3,"Mediocre to some, classic to others...","This CD/DVD compilation celebrates the merging of SONY Music with BMG. The case is marked ""For promotional, not for sale"". However, this sampler is out there being sold cheap. The CD program is uneven! For example, where do you find Barry Manilow and Miles Davis on the same disc? The DVD features early low tech MTV like videos. The track featuring Luther Vandross, leaves us with a pleasant memory of his recent passing. This set is a worthy addition, I suppose for historical value.PS: Included, not listed above are a CD track, Janis Joplin's ""Piece of my heart"" and DVD track of Cheap Trick's ""Dream Police""."
4,A wonderful glimpse of Rome and the Vatican of 100 years ago,"Rome is the second book of a trilogy that started with Lourdes and concludes with Paris. Often called the Three Cities trilogy, the books could also be called Faith, Hope, and Charity. Rome picks up the story of a disillusioned priest as he goes to Rome to defend his book which is to be placed on the Index of Prohibited Books. The story explores his hope for a new Christianity that will meet the needs of modern society and his confrontation with a religious organization unable to change with the times. Zola's critical description of Papal bureaucracy will not endear this work to devout Catholics, but his description of the inner workings of the Vatican is informative and fascinating."
1,B-o-r-i-n-g!,"I also consider the narrator completely unbelievable a gay man. The self-hating, pathetic aging man is a cliché, but then so are the musings on Lévi-Strauss, Foucault, and art house films beloved by would-be cosmopolitan students of the 1960s. For a 166-page book with few words per page, this seems VERY long. The pleasures and insights are very few. Anyone who wants to read about desolated Chinese homosexuals lost on Taiwan, Pai's old novel _Crystal Boys_ is far more engaging."
4,Good job!,"This book was not exactly the best Fear Street book I have ever read, but it was still very good. I would recommend it to Fear Street Fans."
3,"If you own the other Lotar DVDs, you won't need this one","If you own the pistol and carbine dvds from Lotar, you won't need to see this one. The material is already covered in those dvds and nothing new is introduced. If you don't have them, then you will like this dvd. I own the other two dvds so I was disappointed to find that this dvd didn't really teach me anything new. In fact, I would recommend owning the other two dvds over this one."
1,"No, no, no, no, no. This should not be!","I am sure that the Bolos books were a good read. It is unfortunate that I happened to begin with the dregs of short stories written by different people. This is obviously an attempt to captialise on what must have been a good series.This book does not stand on its own. As far as I can tell the Bolos are just very big tanks that can do a bit of thinking for themselves. After that it's a case of bang bang flash, ten year old kid's stuff with ray guns. No characterisation, no empathy with the characters, who they defend or the ""dreaded"" enemy. Nothing. This is cheap thin cardboard and is just the kind of rubbish that should not be published.Whoever the editor and publisher are - shame on you. There are too many good books waiting to be published to put this trash on the shelves. Go hang your heads in shame.There is so little substance in this book, it is impossible to really attack it. How can you attack something without substance. I want my money back!"
4,worth it if you commit to exfoliating each day,"I like this product, but it's been expensive on other sites, so I am pleased to see this price here. It works rather quickly, but you must exfoliate your heels each day with a pumice or wash cloth used briskly. I haven't found any other products that work. However, the dry condition does return, so you'll have to purchase periodically."
2,didn't bring miracle,"I've tried different kinds of foot care cream and ointment and I didn't particularly find this product any better than the others. It moisturizes, but it is very sticky and oily so I don't want to use it except when I have time to stay on a couch for at least half an hour without putting down my feet on the floor. After spending $15 on this product I ended up investing in Diamancel."
2,Too greasy,"Didn't seem to do anything for my feet. They did get soft, but very greasy, and I did not use that much ointment on my feety."
2,Callous diminisher?,"This product arrived quickly and was exactly as described. I've been using it as directed for over two months now, and I see no difference at all in my callous. I've no issues with the seller or the service, it just doesn't work."
2,Disappointing,"This gel does not work any better than generic petroleum gel like Vaseline. It is a thick gel and hard to handle, after applying the gel to my heels, my hand and fingers are super sticky and even with warm water and soap, I can't wash it off completely. I can just use Vaseline and would get the same result. It softens the skin on the heels but does not shed the dead skin off the callous as claimed. I am disappointed and would not buy again,"
5,Works like a charm,I bought it for my dad who had very dry heels with cracks. Read the ad from Reader's digest. It works like a charm. My dad finished one bottle and he asked for a second one.
3,Could be better,"Davies clearly has a good grasp of the subject and if you haven't read many other books it is probably worth reading. My only real complaint is that he spends way too much time and effort trying to be ""cute""."
5,A Good Treatment,"An Incredible Look at a complex issue and still managing to walk the balance between having enough for the Inteligencia yet still directing much of its comments and explanations to the young physicist without talking down. If you are all interested in the Theory of Relativity, read this book."
3,Not thorough enough,"This book provides an overview of topics related to the origin of time. These include Special and General Theories of Relativity, Quantum theory, discussions about the origins of space and time, superstrings, and others. In my opinion this book has too much prose and not enough depth.If you have a mathematical background, I would certainly recommend the Dover books by Einstein, Feynman, Heisenberg, Schroedinger, and others."
1,Mediated Propaganda,"This book was absolutely horrid! Would not recommend wasting my time or my eyesight. It was required reading for a class and I can't wait to get rid of it. If anyone's interested in seeing firstand how awful it is or picking up a copy for class, I'm selling mine (...). Bottom line-don't read it if you don't absolutely have to"
4,"Content is great, but why not the full season?","This is such a great show which can be watched over and over again. Why not release the whole seasons? The individual dvds are way too expensive. I tried the unbox and I think this is a temporary comprimise, but I like having extras.Tony B. has great wit and makes even the most ordinary experience seem great. His descriptions are many times better than what is happening on screen. This isn't just about eating weird foods, but also about appreciating the everyday cuisine."
5,Legendary Chef,"As a Chef myself and read most of his books this man is a genius and after purchasing season 1, I am hooked like a damm crack addict and wanting season 2 to give me my fix, anyone contemplating weather to buy this stop reading and place your order NOW!!! Also commend Amazon on there shipping times as I received it on the day they said, Awesome Anthony keep it up mate."
4,"Great Show, But ...","Much as I love this show, and the dvds are great in many ways, there is one feature which they lack which truly disappointed me. These are not in any way enhanced with subtitles in any language. While I don't need 'em in any language but English, the lack of English subtitles meant that there were many times when I was wishing I dared to blast the television without fear of waking the neighbors.Tony is hilarious and wickedly funny as always, but c'mon - would subtitles really cost that much more to put in?"
2,Many missing episodes from season 1,"I love Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations Season 1, but was extremely disappointed that it is not the COMPLETE Season 1. Some of the best episodes are missing from the collection. My favorites are Uzbekistan and South Florida. I hope that the rest of Season 1 is released as a collection. I don't think that people should have to buy the episodes separately."
3,Ten minute's use requires fifteen minute's clean-up.,"I find it a little difficult to get the get the consistency I want. Some things get liquefied if the chunks are too big and I want to try for a little smaller. What I wind up with is liquid -- but still with some chunks in it! That, for me is not too bad; I just wanted it for small amounts where hand slicing/chopping wouldn't do the job. I have had the Cuisinart Mini-Prep for three-and-a-half years and used it again, tonight, for the first time in two years! Then I remembered why I had not used it. The parts have too many small grooves and recesses which just do not wash cleanly -- easily. After brushing and scrubbing the disassembled parts I find that to get off all the small smears of food I have to resort to Q-Tips to get the numerous little, tight angles and grooves clean. It's a hygiene horror!"
3,"Danger, Will Robinson!","This mini-processor has performed very well in the short time I have had it. My only concern is the difficult and potentially dangerous way that the blade is reversed from its sharp chopping side to its blunter grinding side. I can see where people without the finger dexterity necessary to do this could cut themselves on the very sharp blade. Other than that, I'm very pleased with the little unit's capabilities."
5,Powerful little fella!,I'm from the Philippines and i bought this through amazon. My friend from LA recommended it. I've been wanting to buy a food processor but haven't realy found one that's right for my use and budget. Cuisinart met both my requirements. I got my processor in perfect working condition. I'm very happy with it and am very satisfied with my purchase!
3,A cut above the rest!,"One of the many humbling distinctions removing the Cuisinart DLC-1SSW Mini-Prep Processor from other fatherless food processors is its remarkable size. No apple or bell pepper is too small for this chopping dynamo. If it fits in a tomato soup can chances are this maestro of mashing will happily puree it and beg for more.Those who enjoy a zesty onion margarita will absolutely adore the Cuisinart DLC-1SSW Mini-Prep Processor's liquifying powers. The blade is atomically sharp and has become my betrothed's favorite appliance for her home surgical needs. Oh, we encased her finger in carbonite. It should be quite well protected. If it survived the freezing process, that is. We keep it in our scrapbook."
2,Disappointing - Aimed at Breeders,"I am thinking of taking on a weimaraner for the first time. I live in the UK and am planning on an older dog, one needing to be rehomed. I ordered this book thinking it would be full of useful facts for a 'novice' such as myself. However, it was smaller in size than I had expected, and was not easy to read due to design. Content was made up mostly of history (deep stuff most people would not need to know), and lists of breeders/bloodlines. Useful to potential breeders but disappointing for myself. Especially since I had waited so long to receive it. Would get my money back if that were possible. 20 sterling is a lot for such a book."
5,Another great De Niro Film,I read the book and was curious to see what the film had to offer I was not disappointed DeNiro and Dano do an excellent job portraying dysfunctional father and son.
4,Interesting and Heartbreaking,The story was so interesting and the characters were perfectly played. I could not believe Robert De Niro playing a down-in-out hobo-type person. So believeable and heartbreaking. Paul Dano was great as the frustrated and tortured son. The scenes in and around the homeless and homeless shelter were so realistic and raw - worth the price of the movie alone! This is one of the best movies I have rented on Amazon.com and I could not believe that I never heard of it before.
4,Being Flynn,"I love Robert DeNiro so I generally watch his movies...this one is a little slow and hard to get into. Robert plays a man with a great imagination and belief he will be successful, just isn't able to put some muscle in his dream and make it come true...very realistic way alcohol can impact a family."
3,Just OK,"Wasn't a great movie, in my opinion. Robert De Niro does a good job, as does Paul Dano, but I found this to be a severely depressing film and in the end I felt it wasn't one I would pick again."
1,Never Watched,"This movie expired or was deleted prior to being watched. That is the reason for no more than one star. It was in my list, then it was gone. Never got to watch it."
2,why do they have to ruin stories with crack and cocaine?,"why does every decent movie have to ticky-tack on sex and drugs. is it mandatory or something?i guess there are no truly good stories left, as this movie discusses via metafiction... can't find a good movie 9 weekends out of 10"
5,Beautiful music with spiritual content,"Tavener is a talented composer from Britain who is influenced by Orthodox Christian spirituality. ""Last Sleep of the Virgin"" is based on a Russian Orthodox hymn and uses a string orchestra and handbells. The combination produces an ethereal and contemplative mood. At first hearing one might be tempted to label this New-Age-style music but it is light-years beyond that. The twin bases of Tabener's formal composition skill and use of Orthodox themes produce a piece of music which is well-constructed, rewarding to the serious listener, and redolent of an intrinsic spiritual value that much music nowadays, for all its claimed spirituality, merely overlays on itself. In other words, it gives the listener what the composer asks - a contemplation of the Virgin Mary and her place in Christendom."
2,Clash of the Titans?,"I was very excited when I first bought this CD. The Protecting Veil's opening sinewy cello winds around through the first several minutes is full of serene and spiritual promise. However, the peace is shattered moments later by another group of strings that intrude playing ""Psycho"" as if they were on Prozac. They stab again and again as the main theme continues to sing obliviously in the shower. Maybe if the attack strings weren't so sedated, the sinewy theme would collapse and die long before the end of the piece. It is rather as if the inspiration for this piece had been PDQ Bach's ""Echo Sonata for Two Unfriendly Groups of Instruments"" rather than ancient spiritual melodies. As much as I tried, I could not mesh the two disparate aspects together and still manage to enjoy the piece as a whole. If you do not mind dealing with a split personality, then by all means try out this disc. Telarc's excellent sound quality is appropriately dreamy/harsh."
1,Very Bad,"I made it through only 50 min of this movie and had to turn it off. The filming is horrible. The acting does not exist and worst of all the violence and gore is a joke. I love Zombie movies, and even some bad ones. But this was unwatchable."
1,"not the worst zombie movie I've ever watched, but it's a close second.","OK I'm a big fan of Zombie related movies and books, and I have to advise anyone who is thinking about buying this movie to stay away, The acting is bad, the special effects are bad, I've seen home made movies that were better than this. I bought this movie as a filler item to get the free super saver shipping from Amazon. I think I would have been better off paying for the shipping."
3,This movie is great with beer!,My friends and I had so much fun watching this ridiculous movie and I can't wait to show it to others. It's hilarious and very low budget but worth seeing - especially if you're drinking (which I recommend). Kill the dead!
1,Horrible,"First off let me start with saying this movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder. I work in the film business been it for over 12 yrs and I have even shot my own shorts. 90 percent of the acting is horrible, the script feels like it was a really bad rip off of resident evil mixed with return of the living dead and all the good parts were taken out. I can understand trying to shoot something with a low budget, but this is beyond horrible. The reviews that said it was a good movie had to be written by people who worked on the movie. Either that or their family and friends. I have seen low budget zombie and horror movies that look 1000 times better then this.I think they spent most of their budget on fog machines and fog juice....there is a fan trailer of Left for Dead on you tube which blows this movie away..."
1,Total garbage!,"This movie sucks big time, the acting and dialogue are both very amateurish, something you would see in a porn film, it's that bad, a total waste of time and money. R. Williams is 1000% correct on all counts, don't even consider this nonsense!"
1,waste. of. time.,"The absolute worst zombie movie I've ever seen in my life. Worst. Ever.I'm a HUGE fan of zombie movies, both high end and low budget, but this one belongs in the ""90 Minutes I'll Never Get Back In My Life"" file.....Horrible movie....horrible."
3,not as good as some would say.,"OK? THIS HAD SOME ENJOYABLE PARTS ,BUT FOR THE MOST PART THIS MOVIE WITCH IS THE ULTIMATE IN LOW-LOW BUGET WAS BORING,SLOW AND THE END THAT KEPT GOING TO THE POINT OF MAKING ANYONE WHO IS WATCHING THIS POOR EXCUSE OF A GOOD ZOMBIE FLIK JUST SAY TO THEMSELVES,JUST END ALREADY!!!!!!! THIS FLIK TRIES IT ALL FROM ROMERO RIP OFFS TO EVEN TRING TO CASH IN ON EVIL DEAD CLOSE UPS AND CORNEY LINES THAT PALE IN COMPARISON TO THE ALL GREAT EVIL DEAD AND ROMERO .I AGREE WITH THE ONE PERSON WHO SAID THIS FLIK IS GREAT WITH BEER! A LOT OF BEER!!!!!"
1,Worst Movie EVER!,The other people writing reviews on this movie must be in the moive. Looks like it was filmed by a 12 year old. There is nothing good I can say about this terrible film.
4,actually...pretty good!,"I ordered Zombie Apocalypse on a whim, and to be honest, I wasn't expecting great things. I didn't recognize any of the names, and it sort of looked just like another dumb straight-to-DVD horror flick.In actuality, what I got was a fairly well-done zombie movie, with just the right amount of action, gore, and camp. The movie is reminiscent of the 80's, when low budgets weren't a problem, because the story was interesting and compelling enough to not need them. That being said, I was pretty impressed with the blood spatter, as well as all the zombie violence.So, yeah, I enjoyed the heck out of this movie, because if nothing else, it's a LOT of fun. It's much better than many of the straight-to-DVD set, though the production cost was obviously low. Zombie Apocalypse has its flaws, but a lack of character and action is absolutely not one of them."
2,uhmm.. yeah! Good effort,"Okay, I love bad Zombie Movies, I really love bad Zombie movies have about everyone made. Well 134 dvd and blu ray of just zombie titles.They seriously need to get some friends that know how to film. Camera lighting etc is below low budget. I giving them 2 stars just cuz I guess with the lack of talent horrible acting and filming i still watched the whole movie. Zombie diaries a much larger budget movie couldnt' keep my interest peaked at all.Give this movie some D1 College/ Community play actors and maybe some seasoned camera film students redo it I think you could have a 3 to 4 star movie in the Zombie Genre.I still reccommend to watch if your a zombie fan borrow a friends copy unless your a collector."
5,terrific book,"We used this when teaching science to our homeschooled kids, grades 4-7. This book is a great resource to explain atoms & molecules in a way that children can understand (plus helpful for those of us adults who don't have a firm grasp on this subject).Appealing illustrations provide interest throughout the book. (see images posted above). There is a small glossary of terms at the end as well as a full page index where you can look up things like gamma rays, kinetic theory, electromagnetic radiation, or references to scientists such as Albert Einstein or John Dalton.Table of Contents: Introducing atoms and molecules; The growth of ideas; Inside the atom; The energy of the electron; The heart of the atom; Elements; Mixtures and compounds; Moving molecules; Massive molecules; The periodic table; Atoms and electricity; Radiation; Nuclear reactions; Working with the atom; The make up of the universeI highly recommend this booklet for anyone who wants to learn the basic science of particles."
5,Best Baby Video Yet,"Whenever I purchase a DVD for me, I usually look for a good family DVD at the same time. Tired of the same Disney fare, I reached for ""Singing Babies Nursery Rhyme Time."" At the time, I didn't know exactly what a great product I was purchasing. The day I brought it home, my 9-month-old son and 2 1/2-year-old daughter watched this DVD all day! In fact, the CD soundtrack comes with it, which my oldest insisted on listening to in her room at bedtime. She has since learned all the words to all the songs and can (for the first time) sing the alphabet song perfectly! I cannot recommend this product enough. P.S. As a DVD fanatic, I enjoyed the bonus features on the disc. The outtakes were a riot!"
2,Toddler Likes.. but terrible singing!,"This little DVD is getting such good reviews, but the singing is terribly offtune. It actually hurts the dogs ears, and I was totally shocked at how bad a couple songs are. I hate listening to it, but I must say my 2 yr old actually likes watching it. Any tips on a good song dvd with on-tune music?thks"
1,Poor graphic rendering.,Poor implementaion of concept. Have tried to lip sync words on cutout type images and videos. Unfortunately Amazon does not accept returns on purchased digital content.
2,Save yourself the pain!,"I listened to this CD all the way through once. I doubt my husband would have been so patient. My 19 month old didn't even express much interest.The song list is great. My complaint is that the 'singing babies' sound like adults trying to sound like babies. They use 'cute' mispronunciations and generally high-pitched voices. Some of the songs were okay. Maybe I'll try it one more time, but I would not buy it again if I had the chance. I'll probably try to either give mine away, or sell it at consignment or a garage sale.Another one to definitely skip is Toddler Favorites by Music for Little People. It was really bad. The singing style of the featured woman is lilting-drippy-sugary-ICK! Luckily my car was broken into, and the stereo - with the CD still in it - was stolen after I'd had the CD for less than a week. At least they didn't get a GOOD CD!....."
1,hated it!!,"I'm not sure why this is recommended together with a signing video, each represents two different theories. Honestly, I prefer to be the one singing together with my children having them watch me pronounce each word rather then put them in front of the TV to watch a bunch of children lip sing nursery songs."
1,Don't buy it!,"This video has all the toddler songs you want to teach your child, that's why I'm giving it 1 star. The singing is off key and the babies look like mannequins with only their mouths moving. Everyone in my family that has seen this video says ""that's scary!!"" My two year old likes the songs but not the video."
3,"14 month old loves it, but not me","The good review attracted me to this DVD. My 14 month loves it. It is able to capture her attention during feeding times. But personally, I found it very disturbing to watch some babies sitting there singing with a computerised mouthing motion. That most ghostly part is the lullaby song. There was this lady rocking the crib in the dimly lit room, and there was a ghostly baby face singing at the corner! I usually skipped this song!For this, I can only give it 3 stars."
5,Grandma Picked A Winner!,"My grandson is nine months old and spends many weekdays in my care, while his mother is working. We go for walks, we play games, and we sing along to SINGING BABIES NURSERY RHYME TIME. Little Jason is so entertained by this show that it gives me a breather in between activities. This is one of the few DVDs that Jason will actually sit still for and thoroughly enjoy. I am most satisfied with this DVD and plan on getting the other one in the series just to mix it up a bit."
1,How can anyone stand this DVD?!?!?!,"Luckily, I picked the dvd up at a yard sale for a buck. I would really kick myself if I had spent any more than a dollar for this creepy, badly made nightmare inducing dvd. The fake mouths on the weird looking babies are bad enough...the eyes actually blink occasionally. The out of tune voices make ""cute"" mispronunciations at times. This is supposed to for young children who are just learning to talk. How is mispronouncing the words supposed to help with talking. If you want a dvd with music and cute kids go with Baby Songs....yeah they are a little dated but sooooooo much better than this piece of trash. I will be putting it in the free box at my next yard sale. Let someone else get tortured my this monstrosity. (At least they won't be paying money for it!)"
1,Real Bad,"After reading reviews I picked it from library.Singing is really horrible. I am surprised to see So many 5 stars (or even 4, 3, 2)?Don't have much else to say, just wanted to give 1 star for bad singing.Kids might like it because songs are popular. (BUT we'll be forced to listen it while kids are listening it!)One good songs DVD which I recommend is Baby Boost Nursery Rhymes.I haven't bought it, have got DVD few times from library. Also it's on comcast on-demand (free)."
3,It's just ok,"I love the songs in this collection. But it seems very mechanical, like they are trying to keep to the exact metranome beat. It doesn't seem to have a life of its own. Maybe there are not enough instruments either."
5,They can dish it oat,"These guys are really good. You should really see them shred live in order to get a better idea of their abilities (I believe). Their first ep is also definetly worth getting although its only available from the the label (...). I don't really feel the need to identify a favorite between the two because they're both noteworthy. My personal favorites on this ep are the first and third tracks. Anyways, listen to it you like any sort of intelligent angry music. Also, wailing guitars and slick drumming are a large part of this."
4,Great Toy!,"This was my first vibrator ever. I am in my 30's and just broke up with my boyfriend. We had amazing sex all the time, so I needed a replacement. The first time I used it I came within 1 minute. I have used it several times and I always climax. I used it today and did twice. My rabbit ears dont line up with my clit, but i make it work. I also have to move it around quite a bit more than what the toy does, but I dont mind. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, but first timers, its great! It does go through batteries, but that is a small price to pay! I love this toy!"
2,i've had better,"after about 2-3 mths this just pretty much died on me and it wasn't from over use. This was not frequently used just more of a when the moment struck kinda toy and the batteries where not stored in it. The bunny stopped working entirely but the rest of it still works but at the end of the day whats the point of a dual purpose toy if half of it is broken, save your time and money there is a lot better out there"
1,defective product,"the item didn't function properly, the wiring was defective and there was no mechanism for return/repair. i'd give it a 0 if that was an option."
4,i-vibe rabbit vibrator,i purchased this vibrator in Nov and my girlfriend has loved it ever since. Its easy to use with the buttons and does quite a bit of things. They are prompt with their delivery and on time. I would recommend this to all..... thanks
2,It's was ok,"I got this about love it at first. However, it fell apart after a month or two. I didn't even use it that much, maybe 3-4 times. When I opened the box, to put batteries in it,the battery cover broke in half! Poorly made. Great toy, just kinda cheap."
3,Disappointed - Now Just Frustrated!,"I have owned this product before. This vibrator is excellent, but Doc Johnson has changed the battery compartment, and that is what I don't like. My i-Vibe only lasted 1 month because the compartment where you place the batteries, literally fell apart!Should have left the original battery compartment (back slides off like that of a TV remote)the way it was.I have since purchased something different, and am loving it"
2,Terribly disappointing,"I owned an older version of the rabbit for a while and loved it, so when shopping for a new vibrator, I thought this one would be my old rabbit plus fun new features. Boy was I wrong! The controls are hard to use and cause some clumsy fumbling. The pearls and such are nice, but that's about it, and when you use this part of the vibrator it is incredibly loud! The vibrator broke after a few months, which is sad because it was the only part I was using anymore. Spend your money on something better!"
1,Junk,It worked for like 3 minutes then made a pop sound then the shaft stopped rotating. Guessing the shaft broke really cheaply made. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this cheap piece of plastic.
1,too much work,"I am very disappointed with my purchase. I lucked upon a doc johnson vibrator ten years ago, it was an awesome toys, so good i named it. So good that when it broke, I fixed it. However, this time when it broke, i decided to treat myself with a new toy. So I attempted to purchase a similar one. I even put my boyfriend out in anticipation of its arrival. I am very disappointed. It takes too much work to get the job done, the stimulator is weak. It has too many setting that when you are ""finish"" you have too much to do to turn it off, and all the lights make it feel like a child's toy, I hope my 4 year old or 6 month old does run across it. I guess i'll have to call my no good boyfriend back, at least he does that well. Lol. :-("
3,It was awesome...then it died.,"I bought this product about a year or so ago. I was so excited when I got it because it was one of my first toy purchases and I heard so much about it. I loved all of the handy functions, but handling the controls was a bit of a challenge. Other than that, I was happy with it...until the rabbit ears died. Just like some of the other users have stated, it wasn't from overuse. I think I only used the vibrator 6 times when this happened and I haven't used it since. If they would fix this problem, I would definitely buy a new one and give it 5 stars."
3,Average Rabbit,"I purchased this and was very excited - you see I had completely worn my other one out - it wasn't the exact same product. When I got the first one it didn't work - but Amazon was great and sent me a new one right away. But this product is not that good, the position of the ""rabbit"" isn't very good - it is a little uncomfortable. But it will work in a pinch. I had to go and get a higher priced one."
1,Broke in the first use.,"It was my first vibrator and it broke in the first use. I did everything correct, but it broke.I would not recommend it."
3,Kinda bummed...,"I got my new vibrator and was so excited to use it for the first time. I have tried using it several times now and I just feel like the dimensions of it are ""off"" I just cant seem to position it right - I think because of the angle of the actual vibrating part.. Bummer! I'm back to using my old broken one until i get a new one."
1,Disappointed and Baffled,"This is the worst vibrator I have ever owned. I was so extremely disappointed when I first got it because of the unnatural positioning of the ears. I felt like I was putting forth way too much effort to have them hit the right spots, which ruined the moment(s). I also noticed that the plastic is made of something very strange, as someone else previously mentioned. The ears turned colors. I know this has nothing to do with my body since the ears obviously are for external use. This was very alarming. Also, the plastic beads stopped rotating after a few uses. The motor would run for them to turn, but they wouldn't do it because the pearls all shifted out of place. I used it until I feel like I am putting in too much work for too little of a reward. I'm throwing this piece of crap away until I find something better on the site. Save your money and go for something else."
3,Under the wrong Impression but still works,I was under the impression that this was going to vibrate to music but it does not. I saw one in a movie and mistook that iVibe meant just that. Although it wasn't what I expected the rabbit feature is quite nice but the pearls seem to get caught with each other on the moving features so I only use the rabbit features since the pearls seem to hurt me. I will recommend one that the pearls are more stable.
3,Not so great!!,"I was really excited to try out this product, so I ran to the market to get some good batteries, and yea, it did an ""ok"" job, but not how I expected. I'm short, so the rabbit ears were way out of range for me. Maybe it might work and hit the right spot for someone that's taller, for me, no!! The beads HURT!!! Especially when you thighten down there>>So since I couldn't returned it cuz it was used, I just got the scissors and cut it up and threw it away. I was upset that I had just threw away hard earned money on this thing."
1,"This product smells terrible, like plastic","The iVibe by Doc Johnson, while very cool looking and sleek, smells god-awful. I assume it's the phthalates used in the plastic, which are plasticizers (substances added to plastics to increase their flexibility, transparency, durability, and longevity). They are used primarily to soften polyvinyl chloride. Phthalates are being phased out of many products in the United States, Canada, and European Union over health concerns.I made the mistake of leaving it in my car for about an hour when it was hot out (around 85 degrees). When I returned to my car, I noticed it was literally sweating. The plastic was sweating, likely plastic material! I can't in good conscious put this inside my body."
2,Battery Guzzler!,This worked good the first two times I used it & then it started wearing out the batteries very quickly. After about the first 3-4 minutes the vibrator would sap enough energy out of the batteries to where the vibration was no longer strong enough to get me there. It's sooo frustrating to ALMOST get there! Just when you need about 10 more seconds the vibration weakens & you can feel the sensation fading. This would be better if it plugged into the wall!
2,Quality seems to be going down,"It's always been disappointing that these things break so easily, but they were worth it, so about once a year, I get a new one. This last one doesn't work as well as the others. Maybe I got a bad one or maybe the quality is just going down. I don't think I will be replacing this one with the same."
5,wowowowo,Amazing!! Get me there in less than a minute....and that is not easy. Fun alone or with my boyfriend.
3,Not fabulous,"It's very noisy and the beads don't rotate well. It's a great little toy for a while but the bullet on mine quit working after a few months. Seriously this thing is loud. The options for movement are wonderful, and the bullet is great as long as it works."
3,It's noisy - but serves its purpose,"Let me just say, when your girl is in the mood have some fun with toys! The noise level with this thing is distracting though - the movement as I have been told is OK, nothing like the real thing though - in a pinch, it's been fun. It's soft, realistic in texture, girth and length. Easy to clean."
1,Not Recommended,"This is a good product, BUT, if it breaks, you are up a creek.I inserted the batteries in the wrong way and the compartment got stuck. Then, it would not come out. I tried to pry it loose. No good. It is useless now.Amazon will not help as they have no repair dept. If the Doc Johnson company writes me back I will change my review.At this time, I am disappointed and pissed. I only had it 2 weeks and thought it was working great.By the way, for those of you that think I am stupid and cannot insert batteries, I'll have you know there is no direction (+/-) on the compartment. That makes it a guessing game. It took me time to decide on which item to buy. I finally make the choice and it's a dud. You have been warned. Be careful if it breaks!"
1,Actually 0 stars,I received this product completely broken and returned it 2 weeks ago and still have heard nothing from you guys. I wanted my credit card reimbursed so I could get something else. I returned it the way I was suppose to. Why haven't you been able to return my money to me?
1,A shame,"I believe this would have been a fantastic vibe, had it worked. I returned the first one I ordered and the replacement didn't work either. What's the point of a vibrator that doesn't vibrate?"
2,It lasted a maximum of three months with little to no use!!!!,"The toy looked good initially, but after less than 3 months of use it died. Only the bunny died, the pearls and such still work, but why have this kind of toy if it all doesn't work?!?!?! Not worth the money for this little use...."
4,very nice!,"It took a while for me to get used to it, but when it hit me, it hit me hard! I still use my other friends, but this is the one that works every time.I'd have Doc J change the battery compartment as it looks like it might wear out, and I do wear these things out! But, all in all, a very dependable toy.UPDATE - three months later, the rabbit died. (I mean it doesn't vibrate anymore, not that it made me pregnant!) Am I that strong?"
3,Enjoyed while it lasted,My wife really liked this Valentine's Day surprise. Too bad the 'rabbit' didn't last more than a few times before the bullet died.
3,raise the flag and let it fall where it may,"Flag starts flying a little too high with the standout tracks from Kaitlyn ni Donovan. The two songs don't prepare you for the slow indi feel permiating this CD. Not to fear, calm, breezy music is ahead with the original lazy voiced genious of Chad Crouch. Chad along with shoe-gazer talents of Amy Annelle, Corrina Repp, Jeff London and Kim Norlen make you reach for the blankets and hot cocao. So, sing along with the sullen, broken romances and stories we've heard before but don't mind hearing again in Flag."
2,This Could've Been A Contenda!,"The concept here is great, unfortunately the label (Heads Up) didn't see fit to include all of the songs from this set, nor did they keep the crowd noise on the disc (several songs simply fade out). I was very disappointed in the (skimpy) 43 minutes of music which appears to be spliced together. Additionally, there is video footage on the Enhanced CD portion containing performances of songs NOT on the CD - apparently taken from the same show (what's up with that?)!!! Overall, this product is below the fine standards that Heads Up has established. Perhaps if enough people complain, the label would consider reissuing this product with ALL of the concert intact. As a result, the two star rating is mostly for the musicians on the disc, who appear to be better than this disc projects them to be."
2,Not What I Had Hoped For,"After having read several of Jackie Collins' books, I must attest this was the worst! I couldn't connect with any of the characters, the plot was mundane, and I was seriously disappointed..."
1,Terrible phone!,"We excitedly bought the Oystr phone for my teenager in late July, activated it, charged it, etc. It never held a charge for more than 36 hours. We tried a charger from her sister's Kyocera (different model) phone. Still no charge. Returned it to Target, and exchanged battery for another Oystr battery. Still no charge. Finally returned Oystr phone with replacement battery to Target and exchanged for another Oystr phone. Again, tried to charge 3 times using the 3 Kyocera chargers we now own. THIS PHONE WON'T HOLD A CHARGE MORE THAN 24 HOURS!!! I got on the internet and found that LOTS of people are experiencing the same thing with the Oystr phone. It's obviously NOT the battery, NOT the charger...IT'S THE PHONE!"
4,Good phone for price..great for younger kids!,I bought this phone for my younger son. It was perfect for him. The buttons were big enough for him to use. The phone was easy to set up and easy to use. Virgin mobile is a great service also for just about any age of user. They have great options and keep getting better!
1,Terrible battery life,"This phone has extremely disapionting battery life. I must charge the phone daily if I want to make calls. The phone is beyond annyoing. The stated battery life of 8 days (without making calls)is a down right LIE. I'm going back to the Kyocera Royal, which makes me look like a technological fool, but in this case I must take function over form."
2,Display didn't work after 11 monthes,"Well, it was a basic working machine until suddenly and without any specific reason, display didn't work! So now it is like an ordinary phone set and I can't read the contacts and all numbers!"
2,I know how to fix the blank screen issue!,"If your screen is blank, or dark blue, power your phone down by taking out the battery. Put the battery back in and get a toothpick. With the phone off, and the phone in the closed position, pinch the toothpick through and push down the power button till it goes on. It may take a few tries, but it worked for me, my screen went on, and I was able to continue using my phone. My suggestion would be to get your contacts off, in case it doesn't work again.Good Luck."
2,got batteries?,"overall a decent little phone for if you just need something for basic use. the quick-key funtioning is awkward and not intuitive if you're used to say, a nokia, but you get used to it.unfortunately (as many have noted) the battery is garbage. even brand new the properly 'trained' battery only holds a charge for about 8 hours and offers less then 2 hours of talk time.a decent phone for a kid or someone who doesn't need advance features - but keep a charger handy in the car, in the office, at home, etc."
1,horrible phone,The phone is cute looking and some of the features are OK but what good are those if the battery life is sometimes less than 24 hours? The longest the phone has held a charge for me is 36 hours and that has been on standby! The screen light does shut off as far as I can tell when the phone is shut so I doubt that is the problem. I originally had sent back the battery thinking is was bad but it looks like the phone as a whole is bad. Don't bother!!
1,Battery Life is Just Awful,"Battery lasts about 36 hours from full charge to shut down, making no calls. Specs say standby time 8 days. I called Virgin support about it - rep says ""8 days is if you leave it turned off."" Not very useful advice. This is not specific to my particular phone - I got one for my dad at the same time, and it has identical battery life."
2,Defective Firm Ware! STAY AWAY!,"I bought two of these phones for my wife and I on Friday. We had our phones on for only one day and the batteries went dead. Neither of us even used the phones to talk on! That means the standby time was only approx. 15 hrs.! A decent user friendly phone otherwise. VM could have a good thing going here, but they refuse to do anything about the battery life of this phone. I called and told them my situation, and they said to take the phones back for a refund. I asked if VM plans to do anything in the future to fix this problem and he said no, they are only 20.00 and you get what you pay for. He then recommended the VM Snapper. I couldn't believe my ears! VM better make this right or they will loose many a customer over this lemon."
1,Oystr -- flashy color flip phone with very poor battery life,"This phone has a great color screen, good sounds and animated screen savers. But, the battery life is only about 1 day without making any calls. The screen backlight and keypad lights stay on for a long time even with power saving mode turned on. I wouldn't recommend this phone to someone who doesn't want to have to charge the phone once or twice a day."
2,BLANK SCREEN???,Bought two phones for me and companion as a Christmas gift.....excellent price..good features......etc etc!!! Now the LCD screen is totally blank!!! I can make and receive calls......but......what the heck???Oh yes......i can bring back to the dealer and wait God knows how long to get it back!!! Why bother??? I'll just let my TOP-UP time expire.....and so long VM/KIOCERA!!!
2,Really bad battery life,"I have this phone and I have to charge it every single day. I've ran out of battery in the middle of conversations a number of times, it is horrible. It has a poor signal also. I wouldn't recommend this cellphone to anyone."
2,Service is Great!.....phone is a Stinker ><,I've used VM service for almost two years and loved it.....but this phone has an abysmal battery. I've fully charged it and NOT used it and it will die within 24 hours....without me ever making a single call!!! Choose another phone.
1,terrible phone,I just took this phone back to Best Buy. I had the same battery problem and mine quit accessing the network about a week ago. I could still call but no XL. BB let me use 29 credit on an 8610 cause it was past 30 days.
1,A waste,Does not work at all. Just waste my time and money. Try others if you can. Anything others could do better than this.
1,crap,"i've been using this crap for over a year and i still have half the bottle leftit cured the flakiness on the side of the big toesbut it made my nail LOOK WORSEHALF THE TOE IS YELLOW!it wasn't really yellow at all to begin with, only slightly yellow on the edge/tip and was unnoticeable until i used this crappy product and now i don't know what to do...i dont know what's going to help now since its worstfinish the bottle? i dont know...i cant even show my toes anymoreim sooo pissed"
3,Don't see much of a difference yet.,Don't see much of a difference yet. Don't see much of a difference yet. Don't see much of a difference yet. Don't see much of a difference yet.
1,No improvement at all,"I bought the product based on many positive user reviews, but now I wonder if they were all comments from people affiliated with the seller?! I have used the product diligently since early November, but my nails are the same as they were before. I'll give it a few more weeks. If no improvement still, I plan to look up their return policy and return the product."
3,It's just vinegar,"The only active ingredient is ethanoic acid, which is vinegar. This is why it has a strong smell.I am also using NailTek for my nail fungus and I prefer it because it doesn't smell that strong."
5,works!,"I have had problems with my toe nails for years. They started to become painful about a year ago. I went to my doctor to see about taking the oral meds that kill the fungus, but my doctor did not want to give me the perscription do to the liver damage it causes. So, I went on the internet searching for a product that was easy to use and had good reviews. Nonyx had wonderful reviews and was not too expensive; so I gave it a try. Before I finished my first 4oz bottle of Nonyx, my two big and two little toenails had grown out complety clear of the yellowing fungus. I had no more pain and it worked with only applying once a day before bed! I have praised Nonyx to many friends and family members who suffer from the same affliction."
4,Good but,"I have used since march 12. It has cleared up the loose nails all straight now, but still yellow.Doesn't seem to be able to clear the yellow. This is my third bottle used twice per day"
1,"Not working, I have been using it for three weeks now","I have been using Xenna All Natural NonyX Nail Gel, For Toenails and Fingernails on my three affected toes but have seen no improvement what so ever. I have been cutting and trimming and filling my toe nails as others suggested. Used the product twice a day(some days even three times a day!) but my toe nails look the same if not worse! I will keep using it until I finish the bottle hoping for improvement."
2,Doesn't Work,I've been using this product faithfully - applying twice a day as directed. It's been about 5 weeks and doesn't see to be doing anything. But I'll give it a few more weeks. Disappointed so far.
1,Does NOT Work at all.,"I used the entire bottle and now the review.I had low expectations from the beginning. I applied the Nonyx twice a day and there was little or no visible improvement. Even if this stuff did work, it would take forever to see any results. Do yourself a favor and go see a podiatrist. They have other treatments that work much, much faster. Also, buy yourself one of those ultra-violet lights for shoes. You put it in your shoes and it kills off any bacteria, germs, etc. As far as Nonyx...save your money, it's a joke."
4,Toe nail discoloration,"I have a nail or two that are discolored, and I asked my Doctor what I could put on it, and he recommended this product, and let me tell you it has been a short while using it and my nails already look better, I am so glad that he recommended it!!"
2,bad smell - go for ReClear AF,"Pretty horrible smell like a cross between melon and mustard/silicone. Lasts for hours even after it is washed off.Maybe it works if you can get past that.I started using ReClear AF / from Wallgreens a little before Nonyx, seems like it is working better than anything else I've tried. It has a very faint oregano-like smell thats somewhat pleasant.Also, tried to get a refund, but no dice on that so far..."
5,Good,"Arrived on time, seems to be helphing. Arrived as expected. Easy to apply, seems to work well. Thanks for order"
2,"Ineffective, but not useless","Toenail fungus is so frustrating. I'm a hygienic person who showers after I work out and before I go to bed. However, toenail fungus runs in my family. I've tried every wacky panacea there is- mouthwash, vinegar, tea tree oil, that crap that you brush on your nails. Some stuff has worked, some hasn't. At one point in my life, all 10 toenails had crap on them. After 5 years of experimenting with these aforementioned products (and wasting hundreds of dollars), I finally managed to clear the fungus from 9 of my 10 toenails. Unfortunately, the left big toenail is obstinate. NOTHING works for it.This product WILL NOT eradicate toenail fungus. However, it is not completely useless. It has prevented a recurrence of toenail fungus on the 9 previously infected toenails. Nevertheless, don't buy this product thinking that it will make your toenails clear."
3,Ethanoic Acid Is Acetic Acid AKA Vinegar,"I should have done more research before purchasing this item. A reviewer on another site pointed out that ethanoic acid is the same as acetic acid, which is vinegar. Perhaps this product works better than vinegar because it contains xanthan gum and will cling better to the nails. For that reason I have given 3 stars to the product. Fungus does not thrive in acid environments. In addition to applying the product I have now decided to pour vinegar on the toes of my socks when I'm at home and wearing open-toed shoes. I have been dipping my feet in a bleach solution every night for months now but the fungal problem has not improved. Maybe adding the vinegar to my regimen will help. I completed a course of prescription oral medication (Lamisil generic) last year but it didn't help either."
1,Pass it by,"I bought this unit because I wanted to be able to get cable tv signal on my computer. The mini plug that attaches the F cable to the usb receiver falls out so often that it is enough to drive you crazy.I'm running my Dell Latitude D830 in 1920 X 1200 resolution. The on screen control panel for the software is so tiny, that I can't see what icon does what. It is also covered in oddly spaced icons and is difficult to navigate.Finally, I tried to use this device with Windows Vista. The HD antenna scanned and reported to me that it could not find a signal. So, I went to a known good cable feed, scanned, and again got a message saying it could only find two channels. It was not able to display either of the two channels that it thought existed.That's it. I'm done. This one's going back."
3,On Gibbsville compendium,"More a collection than a selection, there is no uniformity in length, purpose o subject nor, surprisingly, in style."
5,Gothic Divas,"These C.D. is really cool.CLEOPATRA REC.S* is a very good label to stick to in Gothic Collectional c.d.'s....You won't come across many composed like this.The cover was really erotic close up, and gives it the Gothic Hipand spice.If you do get this c.d. the last thing i'll say to you is- ***ENJOY!"
4,A band at their best yet,"After seeing them open for Blur so long ago, I'm sure never to miss Papas Fritas when they come to town... While previous recordings never lack for charm and melody, ""Buildings And Grounds"" is the sound of a band getting it exactly right and being all they've promised they could be... Touching, bittersweet, sometimes funny, and infinitely hummable, these are among the best pop rock songs being written today..."
5,Incredible,"Can't play this CD enough. Smooth lyrics. Helioself was great, this band has matured into a band worth following. I especially like People Say - crank it up!"
4,Good Collector's Item,"If you're looking for something smooth to add to your collection, I would suggest this. It is a good album for relaxing or if you need some other alternative to current artists that are out there now. The style is close to Brand New Heavies as far as the vocals and music. It's nothing graphic or heavy, just some smooth sounds."
4,Nice but boring,"Nice silky soul, but no great catchy tracks and no groove. If you like to relax and need one more Soul-CD, ok , but if you look for a special something, this CD is too average."
3,Enlightening,I had been doing research on interracial relationships/marriages and came across the Lovings. They pretty much were the final straw that helped do away with interracial marriages being illegal in the south (it happened in June 1967 which is a crying shame that it took that long). This movie was pretty good. Tim Hutton always does well in his acting and Lela Rochon was OK. It was a rather quick movie and it told the basic lives of Richard & Mildred Loving and what they had to go through because they were a black and white couple and got married in the south. I recommend seeing this movie if you have an interest in the interracial struggles of those who fell in love and did what they wanted against the odds and prevailed.
5,Very good movie,It is amazing how things were during that time frame. I enjoyed watching the movie with my family. Gave the movie to a friend to watch.
5,LOVED IT. BEAN & RICHARD,"STORY OF TWO PEOPLE WHO FALL DEEPLY IN LOVE...NO MATTER WHAT!! THEY HAD TO LIVE IN A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD, RUN OUT OF THEIR ""OWN"" HOMETOWN TO MARRY. WHEN WILL AMERICA LEARN ""LOVE HAS NO COLOR"" I BOUGHT THIS 6YRS AGO FOR $5"
1,Have you all gone MAD?!,"I'm sorry but have all of you lost your minds? This movie is $120!! There isn't a movie on this EARTH that I would spend $120 dollars on. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.Overall good movie, but for this price? you have to be kidding me."
4,Interesting CD.,"Its very interesting to hear Robert Burns poems as they were meant to be sung. His most famous poem/song ""Auld Lang Syne"" is sung on this CD to a differnt tune than we are all used to. The artists on the CD are all very good and lend themselves well to the material."
5,Fantastic! A great guide for artists at any level!,"With the tips that I picked up from this book, I've been able to improve my sketches so much that I've sold 4 of them! I just recently ordered Mrs. Hammond's book on how to draw in color and I can't wait to read it. THANKS MRS. HAMMOND!!!!"
2,bit of an artistic crutch,"This book is ok, for those who are not interested in drawing from life, and are content with drawing from blown up photographs. So if drawing is just a fun hobby this book would be super to draw portraits of your friends and family. But If you wish to progress beyond the point of basically making an exact copy of a photo then this book isn't for you. Hammond uses graphs to basically copy a photograph. So if you wish to draw a person, or any object that is not in a photograph this book will not help you sharpen your drawing skills."
4,Very good.,"I've been drawing all my life, yet my drawing style remained kind of sketchy. So I got this book, read through it, and set about drawing a picture. I could not believe the difference it made!! I wish I had found this book years ago! It's not perfect (some of the drawings are overdone, but that's just my opinion), but it's what I needed to put that little extra something into my artwork.Update 6/02/08: 3 years later and I still refer back to this book. I am very pleased with it and how much more sharper, clearer, and lifelike my drawings are."
4,Exactly Right,"This book is exactly what it says it is. The author gives instruction for finding detail that makes your drawing lifelike. She covers every aspect of the face and adds hair, hands, and clothing detail instructions. I have purchased other instruction books by Lee Hammond, but this is my favorite. My art has improved 1,000% and I believe will help as I move to painting."
4,Drawing for beginners,"I haven't applied the techniques shown in the book, but I skimmed thru the contents and the instructions for drawing seem valuable and sound."
1,blah!,"I see these Lee Hammond books everywhere, but cant bring myself to buy any because they are really disappointing. Mostly, the author doesn't draw very convincingly. It is hard to learn drawing from a book when the author's own drawings dont seem to quite connect. It is quite like she doesn't practice what she preaches. It is true that she has a good grip on the surface textures in her drawing, but it is all style without substance. Her likenesses are not that good and there is a ghoulish misshapen look to the drawings that is common in a lot amateur drawing. There are alot of books on drawing instruction. Some are worth the price for the art alone, but this unfortunately is not the case here. It would be easily overlooked if her text had something groundbreaking to say. Unfortunately, she does not really offer anything that is not in every other book on drawing. better to find something with more to say and better illustrations to be inspired by."
5,"Bought his other book ""Drawing Realistic Textures in Pencil""","Great book! If you have even mediocre talent as an artist GET THIS BOOK, too.In one week of using this particular book, my skills as an artist have greatly improved. You'll be seeing my art for sale on Ebay soon all because of the lessons learned from this book. Thank you, J.D., for a really great selection of books."
3,Useful yet the title is deceiptive,"I'm a rank beginner at drawing. I found the book very useful, yet the title is deceiptive. This book has *nothing* to do with drawing, as Hammond begins every lesson in her book by assuming you already have ""an accurate line drawing"" of your model, obtained by gridding your photograph. Nevertheless, she then explains in minute details the secrets of shading, modeling and lighting, and her advice is precious indeed. I found this book especially useful alongside Douglas R. Graves' ""Drawing a likeness"". Graves book is all about drawing, and complements Hammond's book beautifully. If I had only one book to pick though, I'd take Graves'."
5,A lyrical masterpiece,"I think what makes this album stand out from the rest is Tom Burris's lyrical genius. I can't get the first song of the album ""Lifetime"" out of my head. His songs are both imaginative and provocative. Unlike so many other singer/songwriters who can't be bothered to concoct intelligent, original lyrics, Tom Burris sets himself apart with a musical and lyrical masterpiece."
2,the sight of 'mechanics of materials' about this book,I'm an university student. I think after read this book. About 'mechanics of materials' But I don't know. Because I'm baby engineer. So I want your's imformation. Please send me your's imformation. Please.........
5,Still great...,"Here is my six month check up for this computer. After 6 months of daily use (6+ hours daily) the computer is still running great. I have burned it in (for anyone who doesnt know that is when you run the cpu for an extended period of time to test the reliability of the computer) and that went wonderfully. High priority for 10 hours and no problems. No hardware problems whatsoever. Pop in a good graphics card (noone should use integrated video GPU's unless you only want to run Microsoft word) and you have yourself an extremely capable machine. The nforce2 chipset motherboard FIC AU31 combined with the AMD Athlon XP 2800+ makes for an extremely quick machine. At 6 months doing great. These new emachines lineup's are really quality computers. The manufacturers involved, FIC, Western Digital (HD), NVidia etc make this a great choice for a powerful cost efficient computer."
3,Not bad.,"Here are the matches(not in order)Hacksaw Jim Duggan vs. YokozunaShawn Michaels vs. Crush(IC title)Crush vs. DoinkBret Hart vs. Bam Bam BigelowMony Inc vs. The steiner brothers(tag titles)Yokozuna vs. UndertakerI might be forgetting one or two. The tape shows matches from all over the world during wwf's world tours. The video also contains Jimmy Hart rambling on but nothing really but its Jimmy hart so its always fun. The main problem with this video is the fact that there are so many dq finishes. Take Doink vs. Crush for example, this match was going well and was starting to heat up and doink just leaves. Jimmy Hart also talks alot about Hulk Hogan so I was thinking he would maybe appear on the tape but nope he didnt.This video has some good old school wrestling, just be able to stand the dq finishes. The best match is Bret Hart vs. Bam Bam Bigelow which is a classic and I think even made it on Brets dvd."
5,Bo Diddley is one rocking legend!,You want to get hooked on Bo; just go watch some videos of him on YouTube and you will be a Bo Junkie!
2,disappointed,I was disappointed with this product. I thought it would be all Hawaiian style music. It is a mixture of classical and hawaiian music that either starts with wave sounds or birds. Not very good.
2,WORKED GREAT...UNTIL IT STOPPED.,"I was in love with this seemingly economical alternative to an IPOD until it just stopped working. Not sure if it's a short or whether the battery power is just not getting to the MP3 memory/player. Suffice it to say, it lasted 6 months so if you can live with that, it's a nice little player. You get what you pay for."
2,Lasted 8 months,"A good product once you figure out how the shuffle key works. Good versitility allowing both MP3 data, Flash drive data and FM sound. Volume seemed low but I tried other headsets and it seemed to work okay.After 8 months of normal use the LCD panel no longer displayed and the buttons did not work. Contacted Creative tech support and they said I should send the unit in. However, I must also send in a $25.00 Non-refundable check to test the unit. If the unit was bad they would replace it but keep my $25.00. The warrantee on the unit is one year but does not cover labor after 90 days. They recommended I take it back to the store."
1,"DON""T BUY THIS PLAYER","I own a Creative MuVo TX FM 1GB MP3 Player that is great! But, I paid the same for it as this 128MB player is currently listed for. You can get a much larger capacity player than this for the same price. Unfortunately the newer 2GB MuVo V100 has some significant issues with download speed and folder/track navigation so I can't recommend it."
2,Trivial,"Bhabha masks his interesting, if somewhat simple thoughts in an arcane poststructuralist discourse in order to hide their relative triviality. He is a very minor thinker who garners attention only because he has managed to be at the right place and at the right time to appeal to anxious graduate students desparate to have their thoughts validated by an apparently ""difficult"" authority. Strictly for the phonies.But the acknowledgements to this book must be seen to be believed. A more toadying series of comments has never been committed to paper--although I suppose Bhabha, if pressed, would hurriedly excuse their bootlicking tone as an ironic postcolonial strategy, hm? How convenient."
4,Great Services from Amazon Customer Service,My order got lost by the mail and Amazon was great at their service and got me another order asap.. Great services
3,Obscure vocabulary and hidden politics,"The location of culture was stimulating reading. It was helpful in reinforcing the idea that culture is not an easy concept in politics or anthropology. It illustrates how silly the idea of multiculturalism is in PC propaganda and editorial writting.Many words used in the text are not in my 100,000 word electronic dictionary.It would have been helpful if the book had contained more biography and down to earth discription of the author's life experiences."
3,good so far,"the book is straight forward and explains chinese well. the cd goes really fast, but besides that, this is a good choice to get introduced to the language."
5,a very over-looked jack kerouac book,"though a very not-heard-of book, this is a very good book for any jack kerouac fan. it collects many articles written by him on the beat generation, himself, his writing principles. he discusses the beats and their origination. it is a very intersting book for any jack kerouac fan or anyone intersted in the beat generation, though he also talks about himself and looks back on old days of his life as a teen/young-adult. a very good book and i would definately recommend it."
3,three star bias,"This is all great writing and a great collection of articles that Kerouac has written, the only problem being that if your like me and own ""The Portable Jack Kerouac"" you really don't need this book.....and I swear on that, more than 75 percent of Good Blonde is in The Portable Jack KerouacBUT....if you dont own that Portable book than by all means, get this book, wonderful edition to Kerouacs writing, small stories, opinions, sports, and Nasferutu are all covered topics........Excellent so long as you dont already own it......."
3,"Well, it's okay.","Yes, she explains things very thoroughly.Yes, she is quite adorable, asking me if I'm having fun yet.But when they say ""romantic belly dance,"" they do mean it. I'm not a romantic belly dancer, therefore I didn't care for the ""audience interaction part"" and some of her floor work. Some of it was nice and appealing, some of it seemed a little goofy.What I wanted was a lot of veil work and veil tricks. I didn't really get that. I got some things, but not enough. That's why I rate this 3.If you are a beginner and you like ""romantic belly dance,"" this DVD would probably be good for you. She takes you through things slowly and talks to you like she's one of the Barbies from the Toy Story movies."
4,Seven Veils,"Sarah Skinner does a good job of explaining veil placement, and how to put them on so they don't fall off. The choreography isn't particularly complex. This is a good starter video for belly dance with the addition of fun veil technique."
1,Way overpriced!,These are outrageously expensive and never last for the number of pages touted by HP. Can't wait until someone comes out with a generic version.
3,Good Cleaning Suds Sponge,"This Poly Suds/Sponge is good for what it was designed for, although I was unsure of whether or not the blue ruff part of the bottom of the sponge would scratch my glasses and other glass products that have. I called the manufacturer and they said that this particular product had been discontinued, so they had no information as to whether it would be okay to use on glassware. Too bad, since I have lots of glass in my cookware and other things, so I haven't used it since receiving it."
2,Cheap,"out of five inner tubes only four held air, one was not made properly and was not sealed therefore it could not be filler with air."
4,Worth every dollar!,Was real fun and worth the value. it was easy to use.the kids now can lok forward to pool hours.
3,Cute blow-up ring,"I ordered 7 of these for my son's birthday at the beach and all but one blew up well and survived the day with 11 year old boys floating, throwing, rolling bouncing on it. Great value on Amazon"
1,Dissapointing,"I must agree with previous reviewers. I was expecting a very good quality product because of the Intex name, however this product should probably be removed from the Amazon market. I purchased two of these. I filled one up and was pleased, then I attempted to fill the second one and realized there was a large split in the inner seam of the tube. A few days later I realized the second tube which I thought was okay actually had two very tiny holes along the seem that was allowing the air to slowly escape. At first I thought it was from the sun and kept filling it back up, then after a full day of not using the tube it went completely flat. These tubes get scorching hot if left in the sun, unlike other tube brands. I wish these tubes had not been defective because they seem very nice, unfortunately they are defective and you should be aware that if you order this product you will most likely return it as I did."
1,Naive claims,It's absurd to pay this much for AV cables. There is no difference in quality between these and the run of the mill ones you got in decades past. Save your money.
3,Good Quality Cables but,These cabels are good quality for a good price. The issue I had with them was the connections were not tight enough. They also are a little long at the connection end if having limited space in a cabinet.
4,Good conectors,This cables are pretty good considering the price I paid. The gold plated connectors fit well and the cable is thicker than the average A/V cable.
4,As good as cables 100 times the price,"You can trust Belkin, and they've gone the extra mile in their PureAV cable line. Gold contacts (can't hurt, right?), with the tip and sleeve split for extra-solid contact. My only criticism: these don't seem particularly well-shielded -- mine pick up some noise from adjacent video cables. But any analog cable is going to introduce *some* noise, miracles being in short supply these last couple of millenia."
5,Well made cable,I purchased one of these cables and now a second one. The cables are well made and are priced reasonably.
5,"Sturdy Cables, Great Quality",Bought these for my new surround sound system and they are great. The cables are thick and the male parts are very sturdy. I have had no problems with sound distortion or shorting out where the cable meets the male apparatus. They are worth the extra few dollars.
5,Extreme Potential...,"I worked in one of the bars where Matt used to play, and I'd always say that he'll be the next Stevie Ray. It's the combination of his ability to play the guitar and his ability to write the lyrics that make him unique. We all have to start somewhere, so if you don't see him or hear him now, one day soon you'll hear him everywhere. Keep doing what you're doing, Matt."
4,Gritty and raw with a passion uncommon for these days.,"I have seen Otis Rush, Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaugh, Jimmy Paige, John Hammond, Buddy Guy, Carlos Santana, and the great B.B. King. So I've heard some great guitarist. Matt Powell is a great guitarist. Remember his name."
5,Extraordinary new blues guitarist. A must hear!,"If you love the blues, you'll love Matt Powell. He makes absolute magic with his guitar and leaves you begging for more when the CD is done. Remember his name and buy this CD, because someday he is going to make it big."
5,Pretty,I found this perfume about 7 or 8 years ago. It smells very good. The price was very resonable. I've given this as a gift and each person that I've given it to loves it. I wish there was a body cream to match it. Wonderfule fragrance.
5,Explains why AC motors work and DC won't for electric cars.,AC motor under computer contol is efficient enough to work when electric storage becomes cost effective. DC motors do not have the efficiency or enable the needed level of computer control. The Tessla is an example of AC control. Good book at affordable price.
3,The episodes are there but the quality is not great,"Seasons 2 and 3 are available in Europe (Amazons UK site has it a little cheaper than the one here). These DVDs do not appear to have been remastered so if Film quality is critical, you will be disappointed. The DVDs are very watchable, just don't compare them to other releases of old TV shows that have been remastered. These old Kojak episodes are better than anything new being offered on TV today, in my opinion anyway. You will need an ""all region"" DVD player to watch this on an American DVD player."
5,Great job!,"Yes, I've had the UK releases for a couple of years. They were what they were, and fine. The Shout! release is absolutely superb. Just got mine today. Watching it as I write this. Let's hope Shout! continues the series. And others. They do a great job."
5,Awesome,"Am a great fan of Telly Savalas in his Kojak series, and this second season is chock full of Telly at his best as super sleuth in NYC in the 1970's. Enjoying every minute of this super DVD. Great seller, thanks!"
5,outstanding quality,I love kojak. the videos are well made. telly savalas is and was a great actor. this series is proof. another movie he was in he played a gangster boss ....good too.
2,Shout Factory = Cheap!,Kojack was one cool cop! And a great TV show. But Shout Factory = CHEAP!NO Closed Captions are SDH for the hard of hearing. Shout is to cheap to put them on.No good remastering. Again to cheap. All shout can think of is. How much can we rip the fools off and put in are acount.You will not get my money Shout.
4,Great for Strength training,"I was first drawn to this DVD because of the music it had, which I really really do like.But the first time I used this, I thought that it was SUCH an easy workout, since I bellydance a lot but have been recently been doing a bollywood workout. So I thought i was ""too fit"" for this workout.The next day, my upper body was sore and so were my inner thighs.This workout has helped a lot with my posture. I'm not even really aware that I'm standing and sitting taller, just does wonders for the upper back, especially when you are squatting and are in ""straight back"" position.The only thing I didn't really like about this video is that, if you haven't had experience in being in an actual dance class and can memorize moves and follow directions flowingly, then you might have a problem keeping up.But if you're a dancer like I am, then I totally suggest this to you!"
3,Not for me,The previews made this interesting. I was thinking I was going to get some belly dance drills along with overall body workout. The video I saw showed a lot of arm work. I love to dance and love a fun and challenging work out. The first half was ok. I was hoping it got better in the second half. More intensity with more advanced moves. If you are not in shape and need to go a slower pace this will be great for you. It was not the work out I was looking for. I thought it was more of a fast paced workout. Too much talking to me. The music on the second part was just not helping at all. I did not need the briefing on how to do the steps they were very easy to follow it could have been explained briefly right before the exercise.
3,Not as easy as it appears......,"Previews always make things look so easy and it can be so misleading. I bought this dvd awhile ago excited at the opportunity to learn what looked to me to be really cool dancing (it still is fun). When I saw the preview of it I was so excited and I ordered it almost right away. My gripes with it however have led this dvd to remain on my shelf for now until I have more dancing experience. They spend very little time on the precautions and foot movements before diving right in with a go go go pace. It seems they should have mentioned at some point in the beginning that this is not a beginner workout dvd. If you want to get a good workout, I would suggest finding something easier before starting on the Shakra Industrial Workout. I couldn't even make it 15 minutes in when I started it. I'm in somewhat better shape now and will eventually try it again but if you are a true beginner like me and have no dancing background, buy this dvd later rather than sooner."
3,It just won't stop!,"I really loved the way these girls personalities came out in the intro, but this was otherwise disappointing. The pace of this workout was way off. For every 3 minutes of movement there seemed to be a whole minute where you stop everything and talk. It seems this workout was clumsily put together and so was the menu system. The workout feels like it goes on forever but the next day, the only place I feel it is in my hamstrings.The long and short of it is, I'd much rather have bought a video of their performances (which are strangely only glimpsed on the DVD) than the workout. Though, to be fair, the music track is great and the moves are fun. Overall, just poorly put together. Sorry Shakra!"
4,Irish Peasant on Centre Stage,"William Carleton(1794-1869) has deservedly earned a further biographical expose. Carleton gave us vivid portrayals of the Irish peasantry prior to their headlong fall into the Great Famine abyss of 1847. As a fellow serf; Carleton had hands-on experience of Irish rural conditions in early 19th century Ireland. David Krause,the wellknown biographer of Sean O'Casey,has provided us with an excellently researched and annotated account of Carleton's life and published work. It is both erudite and timely.Krause deserves immense credit in putting Wm.Carleton centre stage among English literary giants."
5,No words are adequate praise!,"I have taught this course three times over the past ten years to women. I always run out of books and the class grows and overflows. Years later, women thank me for teaching this course. It is accurate, complete, and easily understood. The survey provides a beautiful and simple panorama of the Bible, with plenty of depth. Could not be any better! Buy it, study it, share it and keep it--you will refer to it regularly and treasure it always!"
4,IT'S COOL!!!!!!!,"Finally, the last season of one of the best shows ever, Saved by the Bell. Why they released (generally inferior) The College Years ahead of this, out of order, is a mystery. This last season presented an unusual scenario: NBC wanted more episodes after they finished taping, and when Elizabeth Berkley and Tiffani Amber Thiessen weren't available, NBC subsituted biker chick Tori to replace them. The Tori episodes are decent, but you'll miss Kelly Kapowski. One last thing: in order to fully complete the Saved by the Bell collection, they need to give us a 2 disc set of Saved by the Bell: Hawaiian Style and Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Last Vegas!"
3,Why did they ever bring Tori in?,"This starts off promisingly, with the savvy six getting up to more misdemenours at Bayside High School. Unfortunately halfway through the episodes Kelly and Jessie disappear without explanation and are 'replaced' by the rather lame character of Tori Scott. The episodes then alternate in their original airing order between 'Tori' episodes and 'Kelly and Jessie' episodes so it doesn't always make a lot of sense to watch them in this order. However, all's well that ends well with Kelly and Jessie miraculously reappearing for graduation. This is the worst DVD in the Saved by the Bell series, largely because of the arrival of Tori and the subsequently poor plotlines that seem to follow her wherevr she goes. They should have just stuck with Kelly and Jessie and made fewer episodes but overall it's a good few hours of entertainment!"
2,no CC available,"Eventhough it was specified in the advertisement that the movie had Close Caption, to my surprise, it didn't. all the other seasons had them, I wonder why this one specifically did not have 'em. The other Seasons even had spanish subtitles!!! This seems as a fill up, even the pacakging is different than the rest. I was quite upset by this."
5,still missing ONE episode?,"is it me or has anyone else noticed that there is a missing episode all together?i have all 5 ""seasons"" but im still wondering.the episode where the gang had their senior trip, and beldings brother was in town substuting. and he had them change the plans to go from camping to white water rafting. and the he ditches them at the very end for a stuardist.is it me or is the episode missing, or is it somewhere and i forgot that i had seen it?but other than this. i love this."
3,Childhood Memories,"The DVD's are what you would expect but with two downsides:- Some of the episodes (3 or 4 out of all 5 seasons I ordered) won't play- The episodes don't seem to be in orderOther than that, it's the show you grew to love."
2,NO spanish subtitles,"I own all seasons of this series and season 5 is the only one that didn't have spanish subtitles. Found this issue very disappointing because although I understand english, spanish subtitles for me are a nice feature to have."
3,They are really out of order,"I was watched the entire DVd and I noticed that One episode would have Tori in it and the very next would have Kelly. Like the episode right after ""the new girl"" featured Kelly. O_o. Or like one episode is the one where Zack and Lisa kiss and the next episode Zack has a crush on Tori and doesn't know how to tell her....I'm finally on episode 21 and it's ""The best summer ever"" where Zack is off the first day of school and they reminince about the Summer vacation (season 4 I think). So yeah episode 1 is actually episode 21 on this DVD. I wonder why they moved them out of order like that. oh well. It kinda takes away from watching the DVD but not tooo much."
3,Saved by the Bell Season 5,"I grew up watching this show but I haven't watched it in years, when I tuned in again for some reason. TBS has aired this show at 7 am for years now. I admit watching Dustin Diamond probably made me not want to watch the show with his recent behavior. The shows are jumbled with the introduction of the new girl and the subtraction of Kelly and Jesse and then epsiodes of Kelly and Jesse minus Terry. Usually the introduction of a new character in a tv series means the death of the show but this is an expection. Terry is watchable and doesn't take away from the show.Overall, I enjoyed this season even if the epsiodes are out of place."
3,nice,i purchased this as a gift and it looked real nice and the quality looked very good.As far as I know the person liked it.
4,Another great Watson Star Wars adventure,"The first story, Legacy of the Jedi was an awesome story. You started reading and hit the ground running. It gave great new insight into Dooku and the beginings of his fall. The second story, Secrets... was not as exciting, but still interesting. It shows Obi-Wan dealing with some of the same problems Anakin does. It also includes a short story by Watson that is about Obi-Wan set before the Last of the Jedi series and after Revenge of the Sith. Overall this book is awesome and you get two books for the price of one. Star Wars fans young and old will enjoy it. Even though the release date say May I found it a week ago at a book store. The cover is different also. The cover actually has Anakin in the forground with Yoda, Dooku, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan in the background."
4,Legecy of the Jedi/ Secrets of the Jedi,Very good book. Helps you to realize that the Jedi do have feelings they have to deal with and suppress. I recommend buying this double set instead of the books separately
1,FIVE stars for this!,"As a Zep fanatic and someone who'll take Pagey over Hendrix, Jeff Beck, or Zappa, I find it astonishing that anyone would give this five stars. What you get here are a couple of Zep-like stompers ruined by vocalist Chris Farlowe, a few moments of creepy guitar/synth pieces, and a lot of typical movie music. It's all very slight and it's all very short and it all was probably picked up off of Zep's cutting room floor. I love Jimmy Page more than my wife and kids but there's nothing here worth 30 bucks. Everything Page did after Bonham's death- this, The Firm, Coverdale/Page, Outrider- until the Page/Plant albums, is the sound of a rock and roll widower with his heart barely in it. If you're looking for more Jimmy Page, seng him the 30 bucks and a request to unlock the vault on 12 years of live Zeppelin tapes."
2,tastes have changed since 1958,"Hard boiled Miami private investigator Mike Shayne endures danger, a sexy blonde and disapproval from his secretary to help a friend. When this book was written, parts of it might have seemed risque. In 2001, it seems odd that our sexy hero doesn't seem to actually sleep with anyone. The paperback cover informs us that ""...Shayne, the coolest private eye of them all, swings into red hot action"" but the action seems lukewarm at best. This book is interesting as an example of the hardboiled detective fiction of 40 years ago, but it won't titillate or interest anyone who is used to the sex and violence in modern fiction."
5,Really Nice,"The 24"" peened grab bar is easy to install, looks great, non-slip grip helps alot when used in a shower"
3,A Cat's Tale,"The book makes clever analogies to the life of the author's cat, Katie, and his relationship with God. You may find yourself seeing your relationship with God in a new, more intimate way. You may find comfort and enjoy the litte parables. I found some aspects of Katie's life upsetting and couldn't get pass those to embrace the book."
2,Okay maybe 2 1/2 stars,"I actually loved this book and read it 3 times before passing it along to another cat-loving Christian friend.The book is great except . . . When the author is referencing God as a pronoun, he uses His/Her; what is up with that????? As a minister, the author should know better than this!! It is just silly.Also, the cursing near the end of the book was unacceptable; grief can be expressed without using the Lord's name in vain. But of course, this is just my opinion."
5,"I Like this has Different ""E's""","Just copied from another siteSupplement FactsServing Size: 1 L-VcapServings per Container: 60Amount Per Serving % Daily ValueVitamin E (as d-alpha tocopherol and mixed tocopherols) 120 IU 400%Natural Mixed Tocopherols 130 mg *d-alpha Tocopherol 80 mg *d-Beta Tocopherol 1 mg *d-Gamma Tocopherol 40 mg *d-delta tocopherol 9 mg *Tocotrienols (Tocomin) 17 mg *d-Alpha Tocotrienol 5 mg *d-Beta Tocotrienol 600 mg *d-Gamma Tocotrienol 9 mg *d-delta tocotrienol 2.4 mg **Daily value not established.Other Ingredients: Lecithin, Vegetable Cellulose."
5,Too late now - Dr Weil is combining into packages,"I really, really like this Vitamin E complex. It is the total package. There's really no point in providing a review since Dr Weil decided that it was better if he put together consumer packages of supplements rather than letting us create our own. This product will no longer be available for separate purchase."
3,"what better way to learn the law of love? eh, MO???","as i watched the videos....i was moved by the way the topics were handled....brilliant! reminds me of the work of david berg, a man obviously ahead of his time! all i can say is that if it would interest you for your child to spend an afternoon in the capable hands of david berg,karen zerby, and steven kelly (a trio of childcare experts), then this video is for you...watch it with your child.....fun for The entire Family!!!!!"
4,Best Anti-Allergen Wash on the Market,Good anti-allergen wash to remove allergies from clothes. If clothes are especially dirty then wash with something like woolite to get them extra clean.
